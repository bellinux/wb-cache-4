25|$|Under their holy king, Tutsi culture {{traditionally}} {{revolved around}} administering justice and government. They {{were the only}} proprietors of cattle, and sustained themselves on their own products. Additionally, their lifestyle afforded <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> leisure time, which they spent cultivating the high arts of poetry, weaving and music. Due to the Tutsi's status as a dominant minority vis-a-vis the Hutu farmers and the other local inhabitants, this relationship has been likened to that between lords and serfs in feudal Europe.|$|E

They can't do it with my pictures. I cut in the camera and that's it. There's {{not a lot of}} film left on the floor when I'm finished.|$|E
25|$|Mohun Bagan {{had reached}} the finals 18 times {{previously}} and made their 19th appearance in the final in the 2015–16 Federation Cup. Mohun Bagan kicked off their campaign {{on a positive note}} when they defeated Salgaocar in a quarter final away encounter. Jeje Lalpekhlua opened the scoring for the Mariners within 30 seconds from kick-off as he headed in a Subhash Singh cross. Bagan however found themselves 2–1 {{down at the end of}} the first half, thanks to 26th and 30th-minute strikes from Martin Scott and Calvin Mbarga respectively. In the second half, substitute Abhishek Das drew Mohun Bagan level as he netted in a goal in the 77th minute from a Katsumi Yusa pass, minutes after he was introduced as a substitute. In the 86th minute, it was Jeje Lalpekhlua who sealed the fate of the match with a vicious half volley past the goalkeeper Karanjit Singh to put Mohun Bagan 3–2 ahead. The match ended with the same scoreline and Bagan had 3 crucial away goals in their kitty giving <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> confidence before the home leg.|$|E

25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E
500|$|Animation for {{the film}} began in January 2006, with the Itchy & Scratchy short being the first scene to be storyboarded. Groening {{rejected}} making either a live-action or a CGI film, calling the film's animation [...] "deliberately imperfect" [...] and [...] "a tribute {{to the art of}} hand-drawn animation". The film was produced in a widescreen [...] aspect ratio, to distinguish it from the look of the television series, and colored with the largest palette the animators had ever had available to <b>them.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the animation was produced using Wacom Cintiq tablets, which allowed images to be drawn directly onto a computer monitor to facilitate production. Animation production work was divided among four studios around the world: Film Roman in Burbank, California, Rough Draft Studios in Glendale, California, and AKOM and Rough Draft's division in Seoul, South Korea. As with the television series, the storyboarding, characters, background layout, and animatic parts of production, were done in America. The overseas studios completed the inbetweening, digital ink and paint, and rendered the animation to tape before being shipped back to the United States.|$|E
500|$|The {{filming of}} the music video for [...] "What You Want" [...] started on July 30, 2011 in a {{warehouse}} in [...] Brooklyn, New York, and it was directed by Meiert Avis.

During an interview, Lee revealed that the music video for the song {{was one of the}} band's [...] "realest" [...] videos adding, [...] " [...] this is more a personal video. We've done a lot in the past that [...] very 'fantasy,' and this is sort of the real us. I just wanted to do something that really felt personal for a change. Obviously, I'm wearing crazy makeup, and that's not my everyday, but, you know, I want ... to connect with the fans again. We all do.

500|$|The {{disqualification}} upset South Korean supporters, {{many of whom}} directed {{their anger}} at Ohno and the International Olympic Committee. A large number of e-mails protesting the race results crashed the Olympic Committee's email server, and thousands of accusatory letters, many of which contained death threats, were sent to Ohno and the committee. Ohno shared his thoughts on the Koreans' hostile reaction by saying, [...] "I was really bothered by it. I grew up around many Asian cultures, Korean one of <b>them.</b> <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> my best friends were Korean growing up. I just didn't understand. Later on I realized that was built up by certain people and that was directed at me, negative energy from other things, not even resulting around the sport, but around politics, using me {{to stand on the}} pedestal as the anti-American sentiment". Earlier the same year, President George Bush had named North Korea as one of three members of the Axis of Evil, which had upset some South Koreans; directing their anger at Ohno was a less direct way of voicing anger against Bush's decision. The controversy continued at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, held jointly in South Korea and Japan several months after the Olympics. When the South Korean football (soccer) team scored a goal against the U.S. team, Korean players Ahn Jung-Hwan and Lee Chun-Soo made an exaggerated move imitating the move Ohno had made during the speed skating event to indicate the other athlete had drifted into his lane.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of {{recording}} The Joshua Tree, the band twice paused to participate in benefit concerts. On 17 May 1986, U2 performed at Self Aid in Dublin. Intended to help alleviate Ireland's unemployment crisis by raising funds and job pledges, the event was harshly criticised in the media for taking pressure off the Irish government to resist Margaret Thatcher's economic policies. The band in particular were labelled hypocrites for their participation. Their appearance included a cover of Bob Dylan's [...] "Maggie's Farm", reinterpreted as a criticism of Thatcher. Hot Press Niall Stokes called their performance [...] "the blackest and most ferocious set of their entire career". In June 1986, U2 embarked on the six-show Conspiracy of Hope tour for Amnesty International, halting the album's recording sessions for about two months. Rather than distract the band, the tour invigourated their new music and provided extra focus on {{what they wanted to}} say. For Clayton, the tour validated the [...] "rawness of content" [...] and their attempts to capture the [...] "bleakness and greed of America under Ronald Reagan". The band used soundchecks on the tour to test out various guitar compositions they had. Meegan believed that U2's time with the other artists on the tour affected their own sound: [...] "Their musical heroes were bleeding into the music and they weren't embarrassed by it, which gave <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> space to work in." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in the series, Clark {{was still}} {{learning}} how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was {{to fit in with}} his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, [...] "He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, ‘Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play." [...] Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers [...] "... alienate him from others". Welling reasoned {{that by the end of}} season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run. Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain—and everyone else so much pain—and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save <b>them</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> pain in the long run." ...|$|E

The disaster of Curupayty had sunk their morale and led to a year's inactivity. [...] And it had fostered an already strong anti-war faction in Argentina. [...] Armed revolutions had broken out in that country – especially in the Andean provinces – demanding peace with Paraguay. It had got {{to the point that the}} Allied commander-in-chief General Bartolomé Mitre had temporarily quit Paraguay with 4,000 Argentine troops in order to put down the revolts, leaving the Brazilian General the Marquis of Caxias in charge.|$|E
