40|$|In {{this case}} study, we examine {{software}} safety risk in three flight hardware systems in NASA’s Constellation spaceflight program. We applied our <b>Technical</b> <b>and</b> <b>Process</b> Risk Measurement (TPRM) methodology to the Constellation hazard analysis process {{to quantify the}} <b>technical</b> <b>and</b> <b>process</b> risks involving software safety in the early design phase of these projects. We analyzed 154 hazard reports and collected metrics to measure the prevalence of software in hazards and the specificity of descriptions of software causes of hazardous conditions. We found that 49 - 70 % of 154 hazardous conditions could be caused by software or software {{was involved in the}} prevention of the hazardous condition. We also found that 12 - 17 % of the 2013 hazard causes involved software, and that 23 - 29 % of all causes had a software control.

40|$|Building {{information}} modeling (BIM) is {{the next}} generation of computerautomated building design. The theory is that all building data would be maintained in a single data format that allows all applications to share data with all other applications. This includes intradiscipline and interdiscipline data sharing. One example of interdiscipline data sharing is the ability to exchange data directly between the architect’s physical model and the engineer’s load/ energy model. Another multidisciplinary application is automated interference checking (sometimes referred to as clash detection). Many readers may believe these types of applications are already in use. In reality, significant <b>technical</b> <b>and</b> <b>process</b> limitations exist, which are preventing full implementation of these and other BIM applications. To understand why interdisciplinary BIM implementation is being limited from a <b>technical</b> <b>and</b> a <b>process</b> standpoint, it is necessary to discuss the concept o...|$|R

Sebelas Maret University (UNS) have used e-learning for 618 courses. However according to Education Development Institute of UNS there are many courses which have no interaction between the instructor and students. Motivation {{is one of the}} causes of this problem. The aim of this research is to develop a model which can be used to determine the effect of technology, design, knowledge expert suport, <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>and</b> <b>process</b> support towards user motivation. SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) is used as a tool to develop such model. There are several stages in model development using SEM: determining the indicators, path diagram development, questionnaire preparation, collecting data, and processing data. The indicators are obtained from previous studies. The questionnaire uses five scales Likert with reliability score 0. 902 of Cronbanch Alpha. The model is developed using AMOS 18.

40|$|Whereas {{multimedia}} {{systems development}} (MSD) is inherently complex, and increasingly so, {{little is known}} about how multimedia designers manage or cope with this complexity. In particular, {{little is known about}} complexity beyond <b>technical</b> <b>and</b> <b>process</b> levels, <b>and</b> how such complexity impacts design activity. In this paper we construct a model of MSD based on the formulation of the broader concept of context complexity. This concept, which subsumes but also transcends <b>technical</b> <b>and</b> <b>process</b> complexity, is used to explain design strategies and their consequences. We identify four design contexts that explain, and are also explained by, complexity. These contexts map out the 'landscape for action' over which design activity takes place. They shape the design environment and the responses taken to it. We use a grounded theory approach to study what designers actually do (as opposed to theorising what they should do). We argue that a better understanding of context determined and context determining strategies better informs interventions aimed at improving MSD design practice. Our main conclusion is that interventions should be directed to those situations where there is a mismatch between the level of complexity in the design context and the level of complexity in the design strategy taken in response to that context. We call these situations 'breakdown' contexts and examine their causes and consequences in greater detail. Our claimed contribution is to broaden the concept of design breakdowns through a specific understanding of the role and impact of (context) complexity in MSD...|$|R
