A line of buildings ran from <b>the</b> <b>Commandant's</b> house to <b>the</b> first military barracks along present-day William Street. These buildings included the Engineer's cottage on the corner of William and Elizabeth Streets in what is now known as Queens Gardens.

50|$|The {{actions of}} some of <b>the</b> <b>commandants,</b> such as Morisset and {{particularly}} Price appear to be excessively harsh. All but one were military officers, {{brought up in a}} system where discipline was severe throughout the period of transportation. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>commandants</b> relied on a large number of military guards, civil overseers, ex-convict constables, and convict informers to provide them with intelligence and carry out their orders.|$|R
5|$|On {{the morning}} of November29, 1729, the Natchez came to Chépart with corn, poultry, and deerskins, also {{carrying}} with them a calumet—well known as a peace symbol. <b>The</b> <b>commandant,</b> still somewhat intoxicated from drinking the night before, was certain that the Natchez had no violent intentions, and he challenged those who had warned of an attack {{to prove that the}} rumors were accurate.|$|E
5|$|The Assistant Commandant is {{nominated}} for appointment by the President {{and must be}} confirmed via majority vote by the Senate. In the event that <b>the</b> <b>Commandant</b> is absent or is unable to perform his duties, the Assistant Commandant assumes the duties and responsibilities of <b>the</b> <b>Commandant.</b> For this reason, the Assistant Commandant is appointed to a rank equal to the sitting Commandant; since 1971, each Assistant Commandant has been, by statute, a four-star general, making it the most common rank held among Marines serving this position. Additionally, he may perform other duties that the CMC assigns to him. Historically, the Assistant Comandant has served {{for two to three}} years. In recent decades, the Assistant Commandant has frequently been a Marine aviator. James F. Amos is the first aviator to serve as Assistant Commandant and then be promoted to Commandant.|$|E

He held staff positions in Southern Command, the military district that covered the South Island of New Zealand, until 1939.|$|E
