40|$|Abstract. Tissue {{engineering}} is a promising therapeutic approach that uses combinations of implanted cells, biomaterial scaf-folds, and biologically active molecules to repair or regenerate damaged or diseased tissues. Many diverse and increasingly complex approaches {{are being developed}} to repair articular cartilage, with the underlying premise that cells introduced exoge-nously play a necessary role {{in the success of}} engineered <b>tissue</b> <b>replacements.</b> A major consideration that remains in this field is the identification and characterization of appropriate sources of cells for tissue-engineered repair of cartilage. In particular, there has been significant emphasis on the use of undifferentiated progenitor cells, or “stem ” cells that can be expanded in culture and differentiated into a variety of different cell types. Recent studies have identified the presence of an abundant source of stem cells in subcutaneous adipose tissue. These cells, termed adipose-derived adult stem (ADAS) cells, show character-istics of multipotent adult stem cells, similar to those of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and under appropriate culture conditions, synthesize cartilage-specific matrix proteins that are assembled in a cartilaginous extracellular matrix. The growth and chondrogenic differentiation of ADAS cells is strongly influenced by factors in the biochemical as well as biophysical environment of the cells. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that the interaction between the cells, the extracellular biomaterial substrate, and growth factors regulate ADAS cell differentiation and tissue growth. Overall, ADAS cells show significant promise for the development of functional <b>tissue</b> <b>replacements</b> for various <b>tissues</b> of the musculoskeletal system...|$|R

50|$|AM {{technologies}} found applications {{starting in}} the 1980s in product development, data visualization, rapid prototyping, and specialized manufacturing. Their expansion into production (job production, mass production, and distributed manufacturing) has been under development in the decades since. Industrial production roles within the metalworking industries achieved significant scale {{for the first time}} in the early 2010s. Since the start of the 21st century there has been a large growth in the sales of AM machines, and their price has dropped substantially. According to Wohlers Associates, a consultancy, the market for 3D printers and services was worth $2.2 billion worldwide in 2012, up 29% from 2011. McKinsey predicts that additive manufacturing could have an economic impact of $550 billion annually by 2025. There are many applications for AM technologies, including architecture, construction (AEC), industrial design, automotive, aerospace, military, engineering, dental and medical industries, biotech (human <b>tissue</b> <b>replacement),</b> fashion, footwear, jewelry, eyewear, education, geographic information systems, food, and many other fields.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} {{plasticity}} and potentially unlimited capacity for self-renewal, {{embryonic stem cell}} therapies have been proposed for regenerative medicine and <b>tissue</b> <b>replacement</b> after injury or disease. Diseases that could potentially be treated by pluripotent stem cells include a number of blood and immune-system related genetic diseases, cancers, and disorders; juvenile diabetes; Parkinson's disease; blindness and spinal cord injuries. Besides the ethical concerns of stem cell therapy (see stem cell controversy), there is a technical problem of graft-versus-host disease associated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, these problems associated with histocompatibility may be solved using autologous donor adult stem cells, therapeutic cloning. Stem cell banks or more recently by reprogramming of somatic cells with defined factors (e.g. induced pluripotent stem cells). Embryonic stem cells provide {{hope that it will}} be possible to overcome the problems of donor tissue shortage and also, by making the cells immunocompatible with the recipient. Other potential uses of embryonic stem cells include investigation of early human development, study of genetic disease and as in vitro systems for toxicology testing.|$|E
40|$|The {{periodontium}} is {{the supporting}} tissues for the tooth organ and {{is vulnerable to}} destruction, arising from overpopulating pathogenic bacteria and spirochaetes. The presence of microbes together with host responses can destroy {{large parts of the}} periodontium sometimes leading tooth loss. Permanent <b>tissue</b> <b>replacements</b> are made possible with tissue engineering techniques. However, existing periodontal biomaterials cannot promote proper tissue architectures, necessary tissue volumes within the periodontal pocket and a water-tight barrier, to become clinically acceptable. New kinds of small-scale engineered biomaterials, with increasing biological complexity are needed to guide proper biomimetic regeneration of periodontal tissues. So the ability to make compound structures with small modules, filled with tissue components, is a promising design strategy for simulating the anatomical complexity of the periodotium attachement complexes along the tooth root and the abutment with the tooth collar. Anatomical structures such as, intima, adventitia and special compartments such as the epithelial cell rests of Malassez or a stellate reticulum niche need to be engineered from the start of regeneration to produce proper periodontium replacement [...] It is our contention that the positioning of tissue components at the origin is also necessary to promote self-organising cell-cell connections, cell-matrix connections. This leads to accelerated, synchronized and well-formed tissue architectures and anatomies. This strategy is a highly effective preparation for tackling periodontitis, periodontium tissue resorption and to ultimately prevent tooth loss.

S100A1 has shown promise as an early diagnostic biomarker for acute myocardial ischemia, presenting with a distinct timecourse in human plasma following an ischemic event relative to traditional markers creatine kinase, CKMB and troponin I. This injury-released, extracellular pool of S100A1 was investigated in neonatal murine cardiomyocytes and was shown to prevent apoptosis via an ERK1/2-dependent pathway, suggesting that the release of S100A1 from injured cells is an intrinsic survival mechanism for viable myocardium. [...] S100 has also shown promise as a biomarker for uncontrolled hyperoxic reoxygenation during cardiopulmonary bypass in infants with cyanotic heart disease and in adults. S100A1 gene transfer to engineered heart tissue was shown to augment contractile performance of the tissue implants, suggesting that S100A1 may be effective in facilitating cardiac <b>tissue</b> <b>replacement</b> therapy in heart failure patients.

5000|$|Biodegradable {{polymers}} and biomaterials {{are also}} of significant interest for tissue engineering and regeneration. Tissue engineering {{is the ability}} to regenerate tissue with the help of artificial materials. The perfection of such systems can be used to grow tissues and cells in vitro or use a biodegradable scaffold to construct new structures and organs in vitro. For these uses, a biodegradable scaffold is obviously preferred as it reduces the risk of immunological reaction and rejection of the foreign object. While many of the more advanced systems are not ready for human therapeutics, there is significant positive research in animal studies. For example, it was possible to successfully grow rat smooth muscle tissue on a polycaprolactone/polylactide scaffold. Further research and development may allow for this technology to be used for <b>tissue</b> <b>replacement,</b> support, or enhancement in humans. One of the ultimate goals of tissue engineering is the creation of organs, such as the kidney, from basic constituents. A scaffolding is necessary to grow the entity into a functioning organ, after which the polymer scaffold would degrade and be safely eliminated from the body. There are reports of using polyglycolic acid and polylactic acid to engineer vascular tissue for heart repair. [...] The scaffold can be used to help create undamaged arteries and vessels.|$|E
