50|$|Elafin, the skin-derived elastase inhibitor, {{has been}} shown to be a potent and {{specific}} inhibitor of both the porcine homolog of ELA1 and human leukocyte elastase in vitro. Elafin is expressed by epidermal keratinocytes under hyperproliferative conditions such as psoriasis and wound healing. It has also been reported to be present in many other adult epithelia that are exposed to environmental stimuli: <b>tongue,</b> <b>plate,</b> lingual tonsils, gingiva, pharynx, epiglottis, vocal fold, esophagus, uterine cervix, vagina, and hair follicles. In all these tissues, the presence of inflammatory cells is physiologic and elafin expression is believed to protect against leukocyte proteases, thereby helping to maintain epithelial integrity.|$|E
40|$|The Worcester orotracheal {{connection}} simplifying {{the use of}} the Doughty <b>tongue</b> <b>plate</b> in the Boyle-Davis gag is described. This {{permits the}} use of intravenous thiopentone and intermittent suxamethonium with nitrous oxide and oxygen through a cuffed orotracheal tube for removal of adenoids prior to dissection of tonsils, an anaesthetic technique which combines perfect control of the airway and relaxation for surgical access with rapid recovery, resulting in improved postoperative condition, less bleeding and consequent reduction in nursing care. Further, the unpleasant sequelae of ether and the dangers of halothane, should the surgeon wish to infiltrate with adrenaline, are avoided...|$|E

It then closes its jaws and pushes the water back out of its mouth through its baleen, which allows the water to leave while trapping the prey. An adult has between 262 and 473 baleen plates {{on each side of}} the mouth. Each plate is made of keratin that frays out into fine hairs on the ends inside the mouth near the <b>tongue.</b> Each <b>plate</b> can measure up to [...] in length and [...] in width.|$|R

On trying to obtain the shock from these helices, I could not succeed at first. By joining the similar ends of i and ii so as to make the two helices equivalent to one helix, having wire of double thickness, I could just obtain the sensation. Using the helix of thick wire (1055.) the shock was distinctly obtained. On placing the <b>tongue</b> between two <b>plates</b> of silver connected by wires with the parts which the hands had heretofore touched (1064.), there was a powerful shock on breaking contact, but none on making contact.|$|R
40|$|A 1 - to 3 -day enrichment-KOH postenrichment {{procedure}} was evaluated {{and found to}} be as effective in recovering Yersinia enterocolitica from meats as a 14 - to 21 -day cold enrichment procedure, with or without KOH postenrichment. The shortened procedure consists of enriching 1. 0 - and 25 -g samples of meat in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7. 2) at 25 degrees C. After incubation (48 and 72 h for 1. 0 -g samples and 24 and 48 h for 25 -g samples); 0. 5 -ml portions of enrichment culture were treated with 4. 5 ml of 0. 25 % KOH- 0. 5 % NaCl for 2 min and 0. 5 % KOH- 0. 5 % NaCl for 15 s, and 0. 1 -ml portions of treated culture were plated onto MacConkey or CIN agars or both. The procedure effectively recovered 2 to 12 cells {{of a number of}} both mouse-virulent and avirulent strains per g of ground beef with aerobic plate counts of approximately 10 (6) to 10 (7) CFU/g. Similarly, the procedure isolated both likely virulent and avirulent strains from porcine <b>tongues</b> (aerobic <b>plate</b> counts of 10 (5) to 10 (7) CFU/g) naturally contaminated with Y. enterocolitica. The organism was isolated from the tongues at similar rates by both shortened enrichment and cold enrichment procedures. Eight tongues were positive for serotype O: 5, 27 strains that agglutinate with WA-specific absorbed antiserum, an antiserum specific for mouse-virulent Y. enterocolitica (Doyle et al., Infect. Immun. 37 : 1234 - 1240, 1982), indicating that the oral cavity of swine is a reservoir of likely virulent serotype O: 5, 27 strains...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Panoramic is {{the most}} widely used radiographs for the oral and dental diagnosis. This study aimed to {{investigate}} the common errors of digital panoramic radiographs in patients who referred to School of Dentistry (Yazd, Iran). Methods: This study was a cross-sectional descriptive one. Four-hundred radiographs available in the department archive were utilized. They aged from 10 – 70 years. The common positioning errors were divided into 13 groups and the study data were analyzed via SPSS (Version 17). Results: The frequencies of errors were as followed: there were only 47 (11 / 7 %) error free radiographs and its prevalence involved forward position (8. 7 %) of patient, back position of patient(9 %), head twisted (6 / 2 %), head tilted (3 / 7 %), chin tipped too low (11 %). chin raised too high (27 / 7 %), slumped position (14 / 5 %), chin not on chin rest (0 %), <b>tongue</b> not on <b>plate</b> (21 / 5 %). Moreover, bite guide was not used (5 %), Prostheses was not removed (1 / 2 %), and metallic accessories were not separated (4 %). Conclusions: Most errors were related to “Chin raised too high”. The lowest error was associated with “Chin not on chin rest”. It seems that the best strategy for having radiographs with fewer errors is appropriate and accurate positioning of the patient...|$|R
6000|$|... 1064. On {{descending}} {{from the}} helix to the mere long wire, the following effects were obtained, A copper wire, 0.18 {{of an inch}} in diameter, and 132 feet in length, was laid out upon {{the floor of the}} laboratory, and used as the connecting conductor (1059.); it gave no sensible spark on making contact, but produced a bright one on breaking contact, yet not so bright as that from the helix (1061.) On endeavouring to obtain the electric shock at the moment contact was broken, I could not succeed so as to make it pass through the hands; but by using two silver plates fastened by small wires to the extremity of the principal wire used, and introducing the <b>tongue</b> between those <b>plates,</b> I succeeded in obtaining powerful shocks upon the tongue and gums, and could easily convulse a flounder, an eel, or a frog. None of these effects could be obtained directly from the electromotor, i.e. when the tongue, frog, or fish was in a similar, and therefore comparative manner, interposed {{in the course of the}} communication between the zinc and copper plates, separated everywhere else by the acid used to excite the combination, or by air. The bright spark and the shock, produced only on breaking contact, are therefore effects of the same kind as those produced in a higher degree by the helix, and in a still higher degree by the electro-magnet.|$|R
