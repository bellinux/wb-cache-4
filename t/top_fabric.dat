25|$|Quilting is {{the process}} of sewing two or more layers of fabric {{together}} to make a thicker padded material, usually to create a quilt or quilted garment. Typically, quilting is done with three layers: the <b>top</b> <b>fabric</b> or quilt top, batting or insulating material and backing material, but many different styles are adopted.|$|E
5000|$|Rallis {{are made}} in a simple way with only fabric, thread, needles and scissors. The top of the quilt (the {{decorated}} portion) is usually the work of one woman. When the top portion is all pieced and sewn together, she will start to sew it together. A reed mat {{is placed on the}} ground. The cloth that is to be the back or bottom of the quilt is placed on the mat. On top of that is placed small scraps of fabric (usually 3-5 layers) that will be the filling of the quilt. These are basted to the bottom with large stitches. The <b>top</b> <b>fabric</b> is then positioned and it is sewn to the pieces starting from the outside edges. Often a group of women will work on sewing a quilt together (much like the western [...] "quilting bee"). The stitches are often very close together (1/8-1/2 inch apart)in long parallel lines extending the length of the quilt.|$|E
50|$|Trapunto is {{a sewing}} {{technique}} where {{two layers of}} fabric surrounding a layer of batting are quilted together, and then additional material is added to {{a portion of the}} design to increase the profile of relief as compared {{to the rest of the}} work. The effect of the elevation of one portion is often heightened by closely quilting the surrounding region, to compress the batting layer in that part of the quilt, thus receding the background even further. Cording techniques may also be used, where a channel is created by quilting, and a cord or yarn is pulled through the batting layer, causing a sharp change in the texture of the quilt. For example, several pockets may be quilted in the pattern of a flower, and then extra batting pushed through a slit in the backing fabric (which will later be sewn shut). The stem of the rose might be corded, creating a dimensional effect. The background could be quilted densely in a stipple pattern, causing the space around the rose bush to become less prominent. These techniques are typically executed with wholecloth quilts, and with batting and thread that matches the <b>top</b> <b>fabric.</b> Some artists have used contrasting colored thread, to create an outline effect. Colored batting behind the surface layer can create a shadowed effect. Brightly colored yarn cording behind white cloth can give a pastel effect on the surface.|$|E
40|$|Recently, as {{interest}} {{in the quality of}} clothing production has risen [1 – 5], the performance and appearance of gar-ments and fusing techniques – especially delaminating and bubbling problems of fused composites – has become important [6 – 9]. Fusible interlinings improve the formabil-ity of <b>top</b> <b>fabrics.</b> They give not only a more beautiful sil-houette, but also a steady form to garments deformed from bending and shearing deformation on wearing [7, 10 – 12]. An adhesion of suitable fusible interlinings to <b>top</b> <b>fabrics</b> is Abstract In this study we have developed a process for optimizing fusing conditions to maxi-mize the bonding strength between a fabric and a fusible interlining before-and-after drying proc-ess using the Taguchi method.

5000|$|In the Middle Ages, {{domestic}} interiors {{were becoming}} {{more comfortable and}} upholstery was playing {{an important part in}} interior decoration. The decorations consisted mainly of what we would now consider as [...] "soft furnishings", though there were simple platforms of webbing, canvas or leather for stools, chairs and elaborately decorated coverings that already demonstrated the rudimentary beginnings of upholstered furniture. By the beginning of the 17th century chair seats were being padded, but this form of upholstery was still fairly basic. All sorts of stuffings from sawdust, grass, feathers, to deer, goat or horsehair were used, although in England the Livery Company forbade the use of goat and deer hair and imposed fines for misdemeanors. The stuffing was heaped on a wooden platform and held in place with a decorative <b>top</b> <b>fabric</b> and nails. This produced a simple dome shape sloping towards the seat. Only {{towards the end of the}} 17th century did upholsterers start to develop the techniques that would distribute and shape the stuffing into more controlled shapes. Curled horsehair was being used more consistently for stuffing that was easier to hold in place with stitches in twine that were developed from saddlery techniques. Thus layers of stuffing could be distributed evenly and secured to stay in place. On a basic level, squab cushions were made more stable by using tufting ties. Stuffed edge rolls appeared on seat fronts providing support for cushions to be retained and later for deeper stuffing to be held in place under a fixed top cover.|$|E

50|$|Convertibles {{borrowed}} the opening mechanism from the all-new Lincoln Continental where the trunklid would open electrically {{in a single}} piece, hinged {{at the back of}} the vehicle, then the <b>fabric</b> <b>top</b> would fold down and disappear beneath the trunklid. The mechanism was originally used on the Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner hardtop convertible of the late 1950s. Opening the trunk on convertibles for storage required that the lid be opened electrically, without deploying or retracting the folding convertible top.|$|R
25|$|To prevent {{wrinkles}} and other problems, the fabric must be stabilized. The method of stabilizing {{depends on the}} type of machine, the fabric type, and the design density. For example, knits and large designs typically require firm stabilization. There are many methods for stabilizing fabric, but most often one or more additional pieces of material called stabilizers or interfacing are added beneath or on <b>top</b> of the <b>fabric,</b> or both. Stabilizer types include cut-away, tear-away, solvy water-soluble, heat-n-gone, filmoplast, and open mesh, sometimes in various combinations.|$|R

The DCA was assisted in this by Michelle Canning, both a highly respected interior designer as well as {{an active member of the}} DCA. Existing furniture was painstakingly refinished with <b>top</b> quality <b>fabric,</b> donated by Michelle. The rooms have been updated with new paint and paper, evocative of the Georgian design.
