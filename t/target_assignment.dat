Agent-based optimization approaches have proved useful in solving {{a wide variety of}} problems including optimization problems. Agent-based techniques can be used in military planning for solving allocation problems such as the weapons to <b>targets</b> <b>assignment</b> problem. Classical methods like linear programming (LP) have been used for solving weapons to <b>targets</b> <b>assignment</b> problems. LP approaches provide optimal solutions quickly, but in real-time planning when there are minor changes to input, LP exhibits widely varied solutions. This can be a problem in practice. This research study considers two agent-based optimization approaches, the Stable Marriage Algorithm (SMA) and the Ant-Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, for solving the weapons to <b>targets</b> <b>assignment</b> problem. In real-time defense planning and re-planning scenario, the effect of the input data changes on the solutions provided by SMA and ACO is observed. An interactive tool is developed in Visual Basic 6. 0 for performing the assignment of weapons to targets using either of the agent-based optimization algorithms. An empirical analysis for determining the best parameter settings for finding good solutions for ACO algorithm is carried out. The performance of SMA and ACO is compared in terms of solution quality and persistence characteristics. Results indicate better performance of SMA than ACO in terms of persistence.

40|$|The use {{of state}} space {{techniques}} to track targets using measurements from multiple sensors is considered. In particular, {{the operation of}} the asynchronous fused Kalman filter is investigated and evaluated, using real data collected from a collocated tracking radar and optical tracking system. An analysis of the effect of additional sensors on the filter's sensitivity to model mismatch is carried out. The performance of the tracking filter is unacceptable in multi-target and/or cluttered environments. This poor performance is attributed to the filter treating all measurements as if they originated from the target of interest. This is often not the case in real environments; therefore some form of data association is required. Two algorithms are developed to overcome this inadequacy, the multi-sensor Probabilistic Multi-Hypothesis Tracking (msPMHT) algorithm and the multi-sensor Probabilistic Least Squares tacking (msPLST) algorithm. Both these algorithms estimate the measurement to <b>target</b> <b>assignments</b> and the <b>target</b> states simultaneously, the msPMHT using maximum likelihood techniques and the msPLST utilising least squares. Similarities and differences between the linear Gaussian msPMHT and the msPLST algorithms are discussed. The characteristics and performance of both algorithms are compared using simulated and real data. A general msPMHT algorithm is introduced with multiple measurement models for each physical sensor. Measurement to sensor assignments, associating individual measurements with selected sensor models, are estimated along with the measurement to <b>target</b> <b>assignments</b> and <b>target</b> states. This allows the algorithm to adapt to varying sensor parameters by changing sensor models. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, 199...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} problem of {{designing}} motionplanning and sensor assignment strategies for tracking multiple targets with a mobile sensor network. We focus on triangulation based tracking where two sensors merge their measurements in order to estimate {{the position of a}} target. We present an iterative and distributed algorithm for the tracking problem. An iteration starts with an initialization phase where targets are assigned to sensor pairs. Afterwards, assigned sensors relocate to improve their estimates. We refer to {{the problem of}} computing new locations for sensors (for given <b>target</b> <b>assignments)</b> as one-step tracking. After observing that one-step tracking is computationally hard, we show how it can be formulated as an energy-minimization problem. This allows us to adapt well-studied distributed algorithms for energy minimization. We present simulations to compare the performance of two such algorithms and conclude the paper with a description of the full tracking strategy. The utility of the presented strategy is demonstrated with simulations and experiments on a sensor network platform. I...|$|R

This thesis presents a fast heuristic to predesignate TLAM <b>target</b> <b>assignments</b> to ships and submarines in multiple battle groups and launch areas over successive time periods. The heuristic allows tasks to be spread or restricted among firing units on a per- target basis, incorporates a variety of task types, and allows {{all or part of the}} target list to be manually prioritized.

Each agent has a limited communication range and knowledge of every target’s position. We study the following <b>target</b> <b>assignment</b> problem: design a distributed algorithm with which the agents divide the targets among themselves and, simultaneously, move to their unique target. This paper focuses on “dense” environments, where the sum of the communication footprints is larger than the area of the environment. We introduce the class of monotonic algorithms, whose worst-case completion time is lower bounded by the area of the environment. We propose a monotonic algorithm called GRID ASSGMT and characterize its asymptotic performance: First, the algorithm is an asymptotically optimal monotonic algorithm for worst-case initial conditions. Second, for uniformly randomly distributed agents and targets the completion time is upper bounded by the diameter of the environment with high probability. Third, if the number of agents exceeds the number of targets by a logarithmic factor, then the completion time is constant with high probability. Our algorithm also solves a sensor based <b>target</b> <b>assignment</b> problem where agents have no initial knowledge of target positions, but acquire them via limited range sensing. I...|$|E
