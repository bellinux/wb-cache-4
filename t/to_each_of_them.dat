5|$|Edwin was {{defeated}} by the Welsh and died at the Battle of Hatfield Chase, on a date traditionally given as 12 October 633. One problem with the dating of the battle is that Pope Honorius I wrote in June 634 to Paulinus and Archbishop Honorius {{saying that he was}} sending a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The pope's letter shows no hint that news of Edwin's death had reached Rome, almost nine months after the supposed date of the battle. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that this lack of awareness makes it more likely that the battle occurred in 634.|$|E
5|$|The tomb monument's design {{included}} {{figures of}} the three Virtues in niches, Cossa's family arms, a gilded bronze recumbent effigy laid out above an inscription-bearing sarcophagus supported on corbel brackets, and above it a Madonna and Child in a half-lunette, with a canopy over all. At {{the time of its}} completion, the monument was the tallest sculpture in Florence, and one of very few tombs within the Baptistry or the neighboring Duomo. The tomb monument was the first of several collaborations between Donatello and Michelozzo, and the attribution of its various elements <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> has been debated by art historians, as have the interpretations of its design and iconography.|$|E
5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> and to the group. Buffy must begin to face her life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated {{with the death of}} a close family member.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} team sport of football, which had 16 participants, fencing and wrestling were the sports in which Egypt had the most participants, sending 12 representatives <b>to</b> <b>each.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>them,</b> wrestling was almost {{exclusively}} male with only one female, Rabab Eid, taking part. The sport with the most Egyptian female participation was synchronized swimming, an all-woman tournament at the Olympics, with eight, while the nation sent six women to fencing, the highest amount for a mixed sport. Among tournaments {{with the potential for}} both men and women to take part, Egypt qualified females, but not males, for badminton, and males, but not females, for track and field athletics, boxing, canoeing, equestrian, football, judo, and sailing.|$|E
25|$|Chapman took {{at least}} four mistresses, who posed as his wife. Three were {{poisoned}} to death by him. They were Mary Isabella Spink (1858 - 25 December 1897), Bessie Taylor (died 14 February 1901) and Maud Marsh (died 22 October 1902). He administered the compound tartar-emetic <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> having purchased it from a chemist in Hastings, Sussex. Rich in the metallic element antimony, improper usage of tartar-emetic causes a painful death with symptoms similar to arsenic poisoning.|$|E
25|$|Self-reducibility {{describes}} the phenomenon that, {{if we can}} quickly test whether a SAT instance is solvable, we can almost as quickly find an explicit solution to the instance. To {{find a solution to}} an instance s, choose one of the Boolean variables x that is input to s, and make two smaller instances s0 and s1 where s'i denotes the formula formed by replacing x with the constant i. Once these two smaller instances have been constructed, apply the test for solvability <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> If one of these two tests returns that the smaller instance is satisfiable, continue solving that instance until a complete solution has been derived.|$|E

Agnes had offered two promissory notes for 100,000 pesos <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> which would be honored by Maximilian's brother, Franz Joseph. While they were in her parlor Agnes revealed the plan to Palacios, who had told her earlier that he sympathized with the Emperor. Palacios was skeptical and said he would give her his answer in the morning. Agnes agreed, believing he would go through with it. Maximilian was executed 19 June 1867 in Santiago de Querétaro.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the attack}} {{the storm had}} {{continued}} and the rain had poured down, {{so that it was}} no small comfort to the weary soldiers when Jean Francois pointed out to them the storehouse, where they all obtained dry clothes, and where a ration of bread and wine with lard and pork was served out <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> Most of the food stores were looted by the soldiers. Menéndez found five or six thousand ducats' worth of silver, largely ore, part of it brought by the Indians from the Appalachian Mountains, and part collected by Laudonnière from Outina, from whom he had also obtained some gold and pearls. Most of the artillery and ammunition brought over by Ribault had not been landed, and as Laudonnière had traded his with Hawkins for the ship, little was captured.|$|E

However, when Morbus once more proves a threat, attempting to permanently cure his allergy of greenery by creating a powerful elixir, it falls to the Trojans to unite the others, and stand against him and the Dark Tribe.|$|E

50|$|From the {{creation}} of the earliest Roman subject provinces, a governor was appointed <b>each</b> year <b>to</b> administer <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> The core function of a Roman governor was as a magistrate or judge, and the management of taxation and the public spending in their area.|$|R
25|$|The {{governing}} {{structure was}} changed by Augustus. In {{the course of}} his reconstitution of the urban administration he created new offices in connection with the public works, streets, and aqueducts of Rome. He found the quattuorviri and duoviri forming part of the body of magistrates known as vigintisexviri. These he reduced from 26 to 20 members (vigintiviri), but retained the quattuorviri among them. The latter were certainly still in existence under Hadrian (117-138). Augustus abolished the duoviri, no doubt because {{the time had come to}} deal comprehensively with the superintendence of the roads which connected Rome with Italy and the provinces. Dio Cassius relates that Augustus personally accepted the post of superintendent. In this capacity he represented the paramount authority which belonged originally to the censors. Moreover, he appointed men of praetorian rank to be road-makers, assigning <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> two lictors. He also made the office of curator of each of the great public roads a perpetual magistracy, instead of a special and temporary commission, as had been the case hitherto.|$|E
25|$|In 1138, the Kingdom of Poland, {{which had}} been growing in {{strength}} {{under the rule of}} the Piast dynasty, encountered an obstacle which impeded its development for nearly two hundred years. In the will of King Bolesław III Wrymouth (Bolesław III Krzywousty), Poland was divided into five provinces: Silesia, Mazovia with eastern Kuyavia, Greater Poland, the Sandomierz Region, and the Seniorate Province. The Seniorate Province initially comprised Kraków and western Lesser Poland, eastern Greater Poland including Gniezno and Kalisz, western Kuyavia, Łęczyca and Sieradz (maintained by the Dowager Duchess Salomea of Berg for her lifetime), and with Pomerelia as a fiefdom. To prevent his four sons from quarreling, Bolesław granted one province <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> while the Seniorate Province was to be given to the eldest brother on the grounds of primogeniture. This decision was meant to forestall dynastic feuds and prevent the disintegration of the kingdom. However, it proved inadequate, and began nearly two centuries of what it had sought to counteract – constant fighting and disorder. Władysław I succeeded in re-uniting most of these lands back into the kingdom of Poland.|$|E
500|$|Memory protection, {{as a way}} of {{preventing}} processes from accessing memory that has not been assigned <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> is one of the concepts behind most modern operating systems. [...] By using memory protection in combination with other security-related mechanisms such as protection rings, it is possible to achieve privilege separation between processes, in which programs and computer systems in general are divided into parts limited to the specific privileges they require to perform a particular task. [...] Using privilege separation can also reduce the extent of potential damage caused by computer security attacks by restricting their effects to specific parts of the system.|$|E

Charles Napier, a naval commander who fought under Pedro's banner in the 1830s, remarked that [...] "his good qualities were his own; his bad owing to want of education; and no man was more sensible of that defect than himself." [...] His letters to PedroII were often couched in language beyond the boy's reading level, and historians have assumed such passages were chiefly intended as advice that the young monarch might eventually consult upon reaching adulthood.|$|E

The staff at the magazine were angry at the approach taken by their managers, and held sit-ins to protest at the [...] "management's bypassing traditional editorial channels and safeguards". The scandal caused a major crisis for Stern and, according to Esser and Hartung, the magazine [...] "once known for its investigative reporting, became a prime example of sensation-seeking checkbook journalism". Sterns credibility was severely damaged and it took the magazine ten years to regain its pre-scandal status and reputation.
