For this example, the bones 6, 7, 8, and 5 are placed in the proper order as shown below. (Note that row 7 in bone 8 should read 5/6, not 5/4)In the first column, find the number wishing to multiply by. In this example, that number is 8. With only needing to use <b>the</b> <b>row</b> <b>8</b> is located in for the remaining calculations, the rest of the board below has been cleared for clarity in explaining the remaining steps.Just as before, start at {{the right side of the}} row and evaluate each diagonal column. If the sum of a diagonal column equals 10 or greater, the tens place of this sum must be carried over and added along with the numbers in the diagonal column to the immediate left as demonstrated below.After each diagonal column has been evaluated, the calculated numbers can be read from left to right to produce a final answer. Reading the results of the summations from left to right, in this example, produces a final answer of 54280. Therefore: The solution to multiplying 6785 by 8 is 54280. (6785 x 8 = 54280) ...|$|E

30|$|Initially, each <b>row</b> from <b>the</b> <b>8</b> [*]×[*] 8 sub-image {{is sent to}} <b>the</b> <b>row</b> {{comparator}} block. <b>The</b> <b>row</b> comparator block compares all {{the eight}} pixels of <b>the</b> current <b>row</b> with <b>the</b> previous <b>row.</b> Based on <b>the</b> output of <b>the</b> <b>row</b> comparator block, <b>the</b> DCT power control block activates or deactivates the DCT core. Thus, the main function of the DCT power control block is to control the power input given to the DCT architecture. If it receives a “high” signal, it disables the power to be supplied to the DCT architecture else it enables the power input. Hence, if <b>the</b> two <b>rows</b> of an <b>8</b> [*]×[*] 8 sub-image are equal, the DCT need not be computed for <b>the</b> current <b>row,</b> and thus, significant power reduction is achieved. Also, the output selection block provides the buffered pre-computed DCT coefficients of <b>the</b> previous <b>row</b> or <b>the</b> output of the DCT core of <b>the</b> current <b>row</b> based on <b>the</b> input provided by <b>the</b> <b>row</b> comparator.

40|$|Research in Western Australia (WA) for {{the last}} few years reveals that in the warm and low {{rainfall}} environments of the northern agricultural region, wide rows (50 cm or more) can produce better lupin yields than narrow rows (25 cm or less) due to improved soil-crop water relations. However, in the broader sense the influence of wide row cropping on crop nutrition and nutrient management is still largely unknown in WA cropping systems. The simulation model, ROOTMAP can be used as a tool to understand the interactions between root systems and availability of soil water and nutrient in the rooting environment, and develop research hypotheses that can be tested under field conditions to develop better nutrient management practices for wide row cropping. ROOTMAP was parameterised for a deep yellow sandy soil from Moora, WA to simulate soil water dynamics and lupin root growth. Two contrasting seasons (wet vs. dry) in Moora were chosen when conducting the two simulation case studies. In the first case study, 8 simulated treatments were designed to evaluate lupin root growth in <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> and between <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> and P uptake when <b>the</b> <b>row</b> spacing and P fertilisation rate below seeds were altered in both dry and wet seasons. The second case study was designed to explore root growth response and P uptake, when P fertiliser was banded in <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> and at <b>8,</b> 13, 18 and 23 cm away from <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> using a 50 cm <b>row</b> spacing. <b>The</b> simulations suggest that in wide row cropping, where lupin plants are planted closely in <b>the</b> seeding <b>rows,</b> having sufficient P supply in <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> is critical to reduce competition among roots for soil P, to improve penetration and proliferation of the roots into deep soil layers, and to encourage root growth and proliferation between <b>the</b> <b>rows.</b> However, in a wide row (= > 50 cm) cropping, banding all P in <b>the</b> <b>rows</b> sometimes could create P toxicity problem for lupins and may result in increased horizontal soil P stratification that could affect nutrient management for following crops (such as wheat) when using a narrow row spacing (10 cm) ...|$|R
