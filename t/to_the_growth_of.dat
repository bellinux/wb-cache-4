5|$|As a governor, Rodríguez Saá {{attracted}} huge {{investments to}} the province, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> local industries, public works, {{social services and}} tourism.

He was a populist and authoritarian governor who was accused of nepotism, corruption and restricting freedom of the press.

5|$|Dubstep is a {{genre of}} {{electronic}} dance music that originated in South London, England. It {{emerged in the}} late 1990s as a development within a lineage of related styles such as 2-step garage, dub, techno, drum and bass, broken beat, jungle, and reggae. In the United Kingdom {{the origins of the}} genre can be traced back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the Jamaican sound system party scene in the early 1980s. The music generally features sparse, syncopated drum and percussion patterns with bass lines that contain prominent sub bass frequencies.|$|E
40|$|Twenty-seven isatin P-thiosemicarbazone (IBT) related chemicals, {{among them}} benzaldehydes, triazinoindoles, {{pyrrolidine}} and acyclic compounds, were examined for their capability <b>to</b> inhibit <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> vaccinia virus and <b>to</b> support <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IBT-dependent mutant in BSC 1 cells.

5|$|The Council of Trent (1545–1563) {{became the}} driving force behind the Counter-Reformation in {{response}} to the Protestant movement. Doctrinally, it reaffirmed central Catholic teachings such as transubstantiation and the requirement for love and hope as well as faith to attain salvation. In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world despite experiencing a reduction in its hold on European populations due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> religious scepticism during and after the Enlightenment.|$|E

This gave rise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> Boston as a port in the 12th and 13thcenturies, exporting wool and salt to the Hanseatic League, though Boston only received its charter in 1545.|$|E

Shipbuilding increased at a number of coastal locations, particularly at Porthmadog, where 201 ships were built between 1836 and 1880. Engineering companies were set up to supply the quarries, notably De Winton at Caernarfon. In 1870, De Winton built and equipped an entire workshop for the Dinorwig Quarry, with machinery powered by overhead shafting that in its turn was driven by the largest water-wheel in the United Kingdom, over 50feet in diameter.|$|E

Biblical references, like the Book of Deuteronomy, the Lord's Prayer, and sin-eating, are examined.

5|$|Throughout the Stalinist period, most Soviet {{workers had}} been paid for their work based on a piece-rate system. Thus their {{individual}} wages were directly tied {{to the amount of}} work they produced. This policy was intended to encourage workers to toil and therefore increase production as much as possible. The piece-rate system led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> bureaucracy and contributed to significant inefficiencies in Soviet industry. In addition, factory managers frequently manipulated the personal production quotas given to workers to prevent workers' wages from falling too low.|$|E
5|$|After the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was {{ratified}} in 1920, the Russian SFSR recognized Lithuanian {{claims to}} the Vilnius Region and continued to support them. In its responses to the 1938 ultimatum, the Soviet Union expressed concerns over Lithuania's independence and threatened to abrogate the Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1932. It made it clear, though, {{that it did not}} wish to be drawn into an armed conflict. This stance has been attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> a threat from Japan; armed assistance to Lithuania would have required the Red Army to invade either Poland or Latvia and could have resulted in a war on two fronts. The Soviets urged France, a major ally of Poland at the time, to de-escalate the conflict and encourage a more moderate version of the ultimatum. France and the United Kingdom, preoccupied with the Anschluss, pressured Lithuania to normalize the relationship with Poland as soon as possible. They feared that the ultimatum had been approved by Nazi Germany.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the bark}} {{functions}} as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew {{their way through the}} cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.|$|E
5|$|Artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci, often {{working with}} naturalists, were also {{interested}} in the bodies of animals and humans, studying physiology in detail and contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> anatomical knowledge. The traditions of alchemy and natural magic, especially {{in the work of}} Paracelsus, also laid claim to knowledge of the living world. Alchemists subjected organic matter to chemical analysis and experimented liberally with both biological and mineral pharmacology. This {{was part of a larger}} transition in world views (the rise of the mechanical philosophy) that continued into the 17th century, as the traditional metaphor of nature as organism was replaced by the nature as machine metaphor.|$|E
5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E
