5|$|Contradicting {{the noon}} and 3pm timelines, Mohammed Tawil, {{the doctor who}} {{admitted}} Muhammad to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told Esther Schapira that the boy had been admitted around 10:00am local time, along with the ambulance driver, who had been shot through the heart. Tawil later {{said that he could}} not recall what he had told reporters about this. Records from the Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly show <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> boy was examined in the pathology department at midday. The pathologist, Dr.Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined him for half an hour. He told Schapira that the boy's abdominal organs were lying outside his body, and he showed Schapira , with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad. A watch on a pathologist's wrist in one of the images appeared to say 3:50.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{prominent}} tales is told within Issues 2 and 3, in which it's discovered <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> Heero once fought alongside Odin Lowe—the man who, years earlier, was responsible for the assassination of the colonial leader Heero Yuy.|$|R
25|$|Tongan {{males were}} often heavily tattooed. In Captain Cook's time only the Tui Tonga (king) was not: {{because he was}} too high ranked for anybody to touch him. Later it became the habit <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> Tui Tonga went to Samoa to be tattooed there.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, a gym in Cambridge, the United Kingdom, {{was forced}} to close its {{swimming}} pool until further notice after health inspectors found an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis.

25|$|Meetings between {{psychologists and}} the young person, their family, and the victim(s) in any {{combination}} or separately, can be arranged with some Youth Offending Teams who have psychologists on staff.

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, {{two weeks}} after playing in a match at Portsmouth, Birmingham full-back Jeff Hall died of polio. The {{realisation}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>young,</b> fit, England footballer could die of a preventable disease sparked a massive rise in demand for vaccination, and a memorial fund launched in his name by the club and local newspapers endowed a research fellowship in the University of Birmingham's Department of Medicine.|$|E
25|$|A {{radio news}} {{bulletin}} announced <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> male teen was found {{shot to death}} at Spring Lake Park. Hundreds of people flocked to the area.

25|$|Nevertheless, various authors believe <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> Caragiale {{did indeed}} support {{nationalist}} liberal policies, and presume {{that he was}} behind a series of anti-Jewish columns, published by Voinţa Naţională during the early 1880s. This was for long disputed: rabbi and literary historian Moses Gaster attributed the pieces to Nicolae Xenopol, while researcher Şerban Cioculescu, who originally doubted them, eventually agreed that they formed {{an integral part of}} Caragiale's work.|$|E
50|$|According to {{producer}} Rick Berman, it {{was originally}} intended <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> version of T'Pau would be the Vulcan officer serving on the titular starship in Star Trek: Enterprise. Instead, after determining there were legal difficulties in using the original series character, the producers created T'Pol.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{official}} of the Congo Government had been insisting for <b>a</b> year [...] <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> son of the old chief should consent to be the Medal [...] Chief. This young man, named Kingeleza, was a fine, bright fellow, but [...] thinking <b>that,</b> as <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> son, he would lack the necessary authority [...] over the people and would get into trouble with the Government if he [...] could not satisfy its requirements, he declined. The Belgian official [...] was, however, so insistent that Kingeleza had finally agreed in order [...] to avoid a clash with the Government.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not known}} when Ma Xi'e was born. He was Chu's founder Ma Yin (King Wumu)'s 30th son. HIs mother was not Ma Yin's wife, but was {{otherwise}} not named in historical sources, although it is known <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> brother, Ma Xichong, was born of the same mother.|$|R
25|$|Steven returns at {{the same}} time <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> woman wanders into the TARDIS {{thinking}} it was a real police box. The Doctor and Steven are taken aback when she introduces herself as Dodo Chaplet and reveals that her grandfather was French. The Doctor speculates that Dodo might be Anne's descendant. (As some have pointed out, this would mean Anne lived to have an illegitimate offspring unless she or a descendant married a man of the same name).|$|E
25|$|The {{emergency}} {{hospital of}} Chişinău reported treating over 78 injured {{police officers and}} protesters on 8 April, while the Moldovan president stated that 270 people were injured in the riots. Moldovan opposition called on the authorities to carry out new elections and on the demonstrators to cease violence. Moldovan national television had initially reported <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> woman died of carbon monoxide poisoning due to the fires within the parliament building set off by the rioters. However, it was later reported that the woman was saved {{by a team of}} medics.|$|E
25|$|This an {{intervention}} programme aimed at infants {{who have experienced}} early adverse care and disruptions in care. It aims to provide specialized help for foster carers {{in recognition of the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> child placed in foster care has to deal with the loss of attachment figures at a time when maintaining contact with attachment figures is vital. It targets key issues: providing nurturance for infants when the carers are not comfortable providing nurturance, overriding tendencies to respond in kind to infant behaviors and providing a predictable interpersonal environment.|$|E
50|$|When World War I {{ended in}} 1919, Hamilton {{resigned}} {{as president of}} the college. He argued <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> man (he was 58 years old by now) should take over. Hamilton accepted the position of Dean of Men in addition to resuming his teaching duties in the Department of Economics.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was widely}} assumed that both Edward Heath, Shadow Chancellor, and Reginald Maudling, Shadow Foreign Secretary, would stand.

25|$|Among {{the many}} {{prosecution}} witnesses to testify was the bus conductor, Charles Reville, who testified <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> girl matching Mona's description had boarded his bus {{in the company}} of a man whom he positively identified as Frederick Nodder, and that Nodder had purchased a return ticket for himself, but only a single ticket for the girl. Also to testify at this second trial was Sir Bernard Spilsbury, who testified that Mona had been strangled from behind with a bootlace or a cord of similar diameter.|$|E
25|$|The Edison {{version was}} {{followed}} soon after by another adaptation entitled Life Without Soul (1915), directed by Joseph W. Smiley, starring William A. Cohill as Dr. William Frawley, a modern-day Frankenstein who creates a soulless man, played to much critical praise by Percy Standing, who wore little make-up in the role. The film {{was shot at}} various locations around the United States, and reputedly featured much spectacle. In the end, it turns out <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> man has dreamed {{the events of the}} film after falling asleep reading Mary Shelley's novel. This film is now considered a lost film.|$|E
25|$|In {{the guise}} of the enchantress, this femme fatale hunts for young men on {{highways}} and seduces the lone traveller to accompany her. Sometimes, she imprisons him in her lair in the graveyard, sucking his blood {{a little at a}} time. Sometimes, she is described as feeding on his semen. Legend says that a churel will hold a young man captive until he is elderly, or else uses him sexually until he withers, dies, and joins the spirit. Another tale narrates <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> man who is seduced by the churel and eats the food given to him, returns at dawn to the village, turned into an aged man.|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "1992", it was {{revealed}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> Marjorino in fact plotted to kill Will Malloy {{for the murder of}} his father, only to be talked out of it by his future wife.

25|$|The villagers of Ploverleigh are {{preparing}} to celebrate the betrothal of Alexis Pointdextre, {{the son of the}} local baronet, and the blue-blooded Aline Sangazure ("Ring forth, ye bells"). Only a young village maiden named Constance Partlet seems unwilling to join in the happy mood, and we learn as she tells her mother that she is secretly in love with the local vicar, Dr Daly ("When he is here, I sigh with pleasure"); and the cleric himself promptly soliloquises that he has been unlucky in love ("The air is charged with amatory numbers"). However, despite Mrs. Partlet's best attempts at matchmaking, the middle-aged Dr Daly seems unable to conceive <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> girl like Constance would be interested in him.|$|E
25|$|A growing {{differentiation}} {{in terms}} of wealth that is visible among settlements sites but especially among burials, indicates the development of social hierarchies. This {{is illustrated by the}} discovery, in 2005, of the burial of a 2-year old child near the Heuneburg, accompanied by imported (Etruscan) jewellery. It is clear <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> child could not have earned or gained such wealth, hence the individual must have been born rich. There is probably also an element of political centralisation involved in these processes. The fact that the Heuneburg and Aussensiedlung were not able to locally produce enough food to support their own populations implied quite clearly that they must have been able to receive and maintain the support of a much larger surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|Stuart Hall and Tony Jefferson {{argue that}} {{compared}} to other youth subcultures, the mod scene gave young women high visibility and relative autonomy. They write that this status may have been related both to {{the attitudes of the}} mod young men, who accepted the idea <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> woman {{did not have to be}} attached to a man, and to the development of new occupations for young women, which gave them an income and made them more independent. Hall and Jefferson note the increasing number of jobs in boutiques and women's clothing stores, which, while poorly paid and lacking opportunities for advancement, gave young women disposable income, status and a glamorous sense of dressing up and going downtown to work.|$|E
