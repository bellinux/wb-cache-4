Another of Nelson's band of brothers who had fought at the Nile, Edward Berry, suggested that a memorial to Miller be created. Nelson supported the proposal, and one was sculpted by John Flaxman, and installed in St Paul's Cathedral. Miller left a widow and two young daughters. The government awarded his family a pension of £100 a year.|$|E

Stopping the fire caused much fire and demolition damage in the lawyers' area called the Temple.

Of the George Herbert engravings he states: [...] "these illustrations I consider the best <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> engraved". By 1856 Evans had [...] "perfected a process of colour printing from wood blocks", and achieved a reputation as the preeminent wood engraver and best colour printer in London.|$|E

Aside from his batting average, disagreements with Pittsburgh's manager, Guy Hecker, reportedly contributed to the decision. The Pittsburgh Dispatch quoted manager Hecker as saying, [...] "Dunlap is certainly the worst man to get along with <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> met. He has had everybody in hot water during our entire western trip." [...] Others speculated that Dunlap's release was motivated by his $3,500 salary and the fact that Pittsburgh's backup second baseman, Henry Youngman, had signed for a salary of only $1,050.|$|E

Months later, Johnson began to court the widow; Reverend William Shaw claims that [...] "the first advances probably proceeded from her, as her attachment to Johnson was in opposition to the advice and desire of all her relations". Johnson and Elizabeth became close, and they quickly fell in love.

500|$|When Hancock {{arrived on}} Cemetery Hill, {{he met with}} Howard {{and they had a}} brief {{disagreement}} about Meade's command order. As the senior officer, Howard yielded only grudgingly to Hancock's direction. Although Hancock arrived after 4:00 p.m. and commanded no units on the field that day, he took control of the Union troops arriving on the hill and directed them to defensive positions with his [...] "imperious and defiant" [...] (and profane) persona. As to the choice of Gettysburg as the battlefield, Hancock told Howard [...] "I think this the strongest position by nature upon which to fight a battle <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> saw." [...] When Howard agreed, Hancock concluded the discussion: [...] "Very well, sir, I select this as the battle-field." [...] Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K.

500|$|As U.S. {{positions}} collapsed both {{north and}} west of town, Gen. Howard ordered a retreat to the high ground south of town at Cemetery Hill, where {{he had left the}} division of Brig. Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr in reserve. Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock assumed command of the battlefield, sent by Meade when he heard that Reynolds had been killed. Hancock, commander of the II Corps and Meade's most trusted subordinate, was ordered to take command of the field and to determine whether Gettysburg was an appropriate place for a major battle. Hancock told Howard, [...] "I think this the strongest position by nature upon which to fight a battle <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> saw." [...] When Howard agreed, Hancock concluded the discussion: [...] "Very well, sir, I select this as the battle-field."

500|$|Toward music {{more adventurous}} than Wagner's, {{especially}} that of Richard Strauss and later Claude Debussy, Rimsky-Korsakov's mind remained closed. He would fume for days afterwards {{when he heard}} pianist Felix Blumenfeld play Debussy's Estampes and write in his diary about them, [...] "Poor and skimpy to the nth degree; there is no technique, even less imagination." [...] This {{was part of an}} increasing musical conservatism on his part (his [...] "musical conscience," [...] as he put it), under which he now scrutinized his music and that of others as well. Compositions by his former compatriots in The Five were not immune. While working on his first revision of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, in 1895 he would tell his amanuensis, Vasily Yastrebtsev, [...] "It's incredible <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> could have liked this music and yet it seems there was such a time." [...] By 1901 he would write of growing [...] "indignant at all [...] blunders of the ear"—this about the same music which caught his attention in 1889.|$|E

500|$|After the Restoration and King Charles II's {{return to}} London on 29 May 1660, a pall-mall court was {{constructed}} in St James's Park {{just south of the}} wall, on the site of The Mall. Samuel Pepys's diary entry for 2 April 1661 records that he [...] "...went into St. James's Park, where I saw the Duke of York playing at Pelemele, the first time <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> saw the sport." [...] This new court suffered from dust blown over the wall from coaches travelling along the highway. In July 1661 posts and rails were erected, stopping up the old road. The court for pall-mall was very long and narrow, and often known as an alley, so the old court provided a suitable route for relocating the eastern approach to St James's Palace. A grant was made to Dan O'Neale, Groom of the Bedchamber, and John Denham, Surveyor of the King's Works allocating a [...] area of land for this purpose. The grant was endorsed [...] "Our warrant for the building of the new street to St James's." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{critic of}} the play was diarist Samuel Pepys, who wrote in 1662: [...] "it is a play of itself the worst <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> heard in my life." [...] Poet John Dryden wrote 10 years later in praise of the play and its comic character Mercutio: [...] "Shakespear show'd {{the best of his}} skill in his Mercutio, and he said himself, that he was forc'd to kill him in the third Act, to prevent being killed by him." [...] Criticism of the play in the 18th century was less sparse, but no less divided. Publisher Nicholas Rowe was the first critic to ponder the theme of the play, which he saw as the just punishment of the two feuding families. In mid-century, writer Charles Gildon and philosopher Lord Kames argued that the play was a failure in that it did not follow the classical rules of drama: the tragedy must occur because of some character flaw, not an accident of fate. Writer and critic Samuel Johnson, however, considered it one of Shakespeare's [...] "most pleasing" [...] plays.|$|E
