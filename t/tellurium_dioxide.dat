Stoichiometry with compounds of arsenic, selenium, tellurium, transition and other elements. J. Bacteriol. 84 : 647 – 658. 1962. —Extracts of Micrococcus lactilyticus (Veillonella alcalescens) oxidize molecular hydrogen {{at the expense}} of certain compounds of arsenic, bismuth, selenium, tellurium, lead, thallium, vanadium, manganese, iron, copper, molybdenum, tungsten, osmium, ruthenium, gold, silver, and uranium, as well as molecular oxygen. Chemical and manometric data indicate that the following reductions are essentially quantitative: arsenate to arsenite, pentavalent and trivalent bismuth to the free element, selenite via elemental selenium to selenide, tellurate and tellurite to <b>tellurium,</b> lead <b>dioxide</b> and manganese dioxide to the divalent state, ferric to ferrous iron, osmium tetroxide to osmate ion, osmium dioxide and trivalent osmium to the metal, uranyl uranium to the tetravalent state, vanadate to the level of vanadyl, and polymolybdate ions to molybdenum blues with an average valence for molybdenum of + 5.

5|$|Boron trifluoride and trichloride {{are used}} as {{catalysts}} in organic synthesis and electronics; the tribromide {{is used in the}} manufacture of diborane. Non-toxic boron ligands could replace toxic phosphorus ligands in some transition metal catalysts. Silica sulfuric acid (SiO2OSO3H) is used in organic reactions. Germanium dioxide is sometimes used as a catalyst in the production of PET plastic for containers; cheaper antimony compounds, such as the trioxide or triacetate, are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about antimony contamination of food and drinks. Arsenic trioxide has been used in the production of natural gas, to boost the removal of carbon dioxide, as have selenous acid and tellurous acid. Selenium acts as a catalyst in some microorganisms. <b>Tellurium,</b> and its <b>dioxide</b> and tetrachloride, are strong catalysts for air oxidation of carbon above 500°C. Graphite oxide {{can be used as a}} catalyst in the synthesis of imines and their derivatives. Activated carbon and alumina have been used as catalysts for the removal of sulfur contaminants from natural gas. Titanium doped aluminium has been identified as a substitute for expensive noble metal catalysts used in the production of industrial chemicals.|$|R

40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the basic {{suitability}} assessment of polymeric materials and the corresponding technological methods {{for the production of}} infrared (micro-) bolometer arrays. The sensitive layer of the microbolometer arrays in question is composed of an electrically conductive polymer composite. Semi-conducting <b>tellurium</b> and vanadium <b>dioxide,</b> as well as metallic silver, are evaluated concerning their suitability as conductive filling agents. The composites with the semi-conducting filling agents display the higher temperature dependence of electrical resistance, while the silver composites exhibit better noise performance. The particle alignment – homogeneous and chain-shaped alike – within the polymer matrix is characterized regarding the composites' electrical properties. For the production of microbolometer arrays, a technology chain is introduced based on established coat-forming and structuring standard technologies from the field of polymer processing, which are suitable for the manufacture of a number of parallel structures. To realize the necessary thermal isolation of the sensitive area, all pixels are realized as self-supporting structures by means of the sacrificial layer method. Exemplarily, 2 × 2 arrays with the three filling agents were manufactured. The resulting sensor responsivities lie in the range of conventional microbolometers. Currently, the comparatively poor thermal isolation of the pixels and the high noise levels are limiting sensor quality. For the microbolometers produced, the thermal resolution limit referring to the temperature of the object to be detected (NETD) has been measured at 6. 7 K in the superior sensitive composite layer filled with silver particles...|$|R
