5|$|Christchurch {{holds an}} annual music festival {{on the first}} weekend in July.

Local bars often host smaller bands and dancing and exhibitions take place throughout the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of Moo, You Bloody Choir, much of Augie March's post-album touring {{involved}} supporting other bands. They played shows supporting The Aliens and Andrew Bird in the United States, before returning to Australia to open for Crowded House. Richards said the band's status as an opening act, rather than headlining their own shows, was something they saw as a challenge—their intention was to win over fans who {{came to see the}} main act. However, he called the tour with The Aliens depressing; the bands played very different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>music,</b> and the attendance at shows was small. Augie March later earned a prime slot at the 2008 Big Day Out.|$|E

5|$|Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> are {{traditionally}} associated with Marrakesh. Berber music {{is influenced by}} Andalusian classical music and typified by its oud accompaniment. By contrast, Gnaoua music is loud and funky with a sound reminiscent of the Blues. It is performed on handmade instruments such as castanets, ribabs (three-stringed banjos) and deffs (handheld drums). Gnaoua music's rhythm and crescendo take the audience into a mood of trance; the style {{is said to have}} emerged in Marrakesh and Essaouira as a ritual of deliverance from slavery. More recently, several Marrakesh female music groups have also risen to popularity.|$|E
5|$|When {{writing the}} album's lyrics, Yamaguchi tried to express both the {{feelings}} that he had, and those that he saw were common in society in the early 2010s. He focused on questioning what {{the role of a}} musician was during this period; and attempted to represent the idea of certain types of people existing in 2011, making certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> He believed that the true role of a musician had become strongly evident after the earthquake. The band also tried to express 2011 sonically, through the style of synths that pianist Emi Okazaki created for the songs.|$|E
5|$|Any album {{released}} by a British artist, or by a band where over 50% {{of the members}} are British, may be submitted for consideration by their record label. The shortlist is chosen by an independent panel of musicians, music presenters, music producers, music journalists, festival organisers and other figures {{in the music industry}} in the UK and Ireland. The prize is open to all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>music,</b> including pop, rock, folk, urban, grime, dance, jazz, blues, electronica and classical. Presentation of the awards usually takes place at an Awards Show in October, after the shortlist is announced at the Album of the Year Launch in September. It is often observed that bands whose albums are shortlisted, or win the prize, experience a large increase in album sales, particularly for lesser known acts. Each shortlisted artist receives a specially commissioned 'Albums of the Year' trophy at the Awards Show. Unlike some other music awards, the overall winner of the Mercury Prize also receives a cheque; in 2017, the prize money was £25,000. The winner also receives an additional winner's trophy.|$|E

5|$|In Elizabethan England, music {{printing}} was {{regulated by}} two royal patents {{issued by the}} queen: one for metrical psalters (psalms set to music) and one for all other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> and music paper. The patent-holders thus held a monopoly—only they or their assignees could legally print music. After printer John Day's death in 1584, the patent for metrical psalters transferred to his son Richard Day and was administered by his assignees, {{who were members of}} the Stationers' Company. The more general one was awarded to composers Thomas Tallis and William Byrd in January 1575. Despite the monopoly, Tallis and Byrd were not successful in their printing endeavours; their 1575 collection of Latin motets called Cantiones quae ab argumento sacrae vocantur failed to sell and was a financial disaster. After Tallis died in 1585, Byrd continued holding the patent, producing works with his assignee, Thomas East. The monopoly expired in 1596, prompting prospective music publishers such as Barley {{to take advantage of the}} resulting power vacuum.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} a tribute to the silent films that were played in theaters with musical accompaniment, and 27 minutes of it are entirely dialogue-free. Several <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> are used to express what is not being said; music acts as the narrator. During Giles' {{overhead}} presentation he plays a recorded version of Camille Saint-Saëns' Danse Macabre. Buffy and Riley's love theme is presented for the first time when they kiss in this episode. This composition by Christophe Beck—who composed scores for Buffy regularly—pleased Joss Whedon more than the Buffy and Angel love theme. He considered the Buffy-Riley theme more adult, but a bit more strange and blue than the Buffy-Angel theme: a prediction of where the relationship between Buffy and Riley would go.|$|E

25|$|During the {{subsequent}} 30 years, Armstrong played more than 300 gigs a year. Bookings for big bands tapered {{off during the}} 1940s due to changes in public tastes: ballrooms closed, and there was competition from television and from other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> becoming more popular than big band music. It became impossible under such circumstances to support and finance a 16-piece touring band.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his work, Tricky blurs the {{normally}} clear sexual definitions found within hip hop. Despite the heavy influence he drew from American hip hop in his debut album, Maxinquaye, he fights against typical sexual representations by, for example, dressing {{as a woman}} on the side sleeve of his album cover. As many of his tracks blend elements of varying <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> creating a difficult to define sound, so go his lyrics, creating a more ambiguous and blurry take on sexuality.|$|E
