5|$|Films of {{the time}} {{typically}} used dinosaurs as monsters, with the added element of atomic fears in the early Cold War. Thus, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953) and Godzilla (1954; American release 1956) portray monstrous dinosaur-like prehistoric reptiles that go on rampages after being awakened by atomic bomb tests. An alternative appears in Disney's animated Fantasia (1940), in its The Rite of Spring sequence, which attempted to portray dinosaurs with some scientific accuracy (although it has the common error of showing prehistoric animals from many different time periods living at the same time) and also in Karel Zeman's Cesta do praveku (1955;Journey to <b>the</b> <b>Beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>Time)</b> Czechoslovakian children's science fiction movie inspired by Zdeněk Burian's work.|$|E

25|$|In The Secret Doctrine, Blavatsky {{articulated}} {{the belief that}} in <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> there was absolute nothingness. This primordial essence then separated itself into seven Rays, which were also intelligent beings known as the Dhyan Chohans; these Seven Rays then created the universe using an energy called Fohat.

25|$|Honko {{asserted}} that, in some cases, {{a society}} reenacts a myth {{in an attempt}} to reproduce the conditions of the mythical age. For example, it might reenact the healing performed by a god at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in order to heal someone in the present. Similarly, Barthes argued that modern culture explores religious experience. Since it is not the job of science to define human morality, a religious experience is an attempt to connect with a perceived moral past, which is in contrast with the technological present.|$|E
25|$|Guru Nanak {{stated that}} his Guru is God {{who is the}} same from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> {{to the end of}} time. Nanak claimed to be God's mouthpiece, God's slave and servant and even God's dog, but {{maintained}} that he was only a guide and teacher, was neither a reincarnation of God nor in any way related to God. Nanak stated that the human Guru is mortal and not divine, who is to be respected and loved but not worshipped. When Guru, or Satguru (The true guru) is used in Gurbani it is often referring to the internal soul rather than a living Guru.|$|E
25|$|Krabi Krabong or Combat with Short and Long Sticks {{and with}} Swords These dances are {{inspired}} by types of combat that were typical of Thailand, in which either sticks or swords are used. The skillful use of the short stick depends on the agility of the fighter, who must attack and always remain close to his opponent, while the combatant who takes up the long stick must maintain a critical distance from his rival to use his weapon effectively. The art of sword fighting has been practiced in Thailand since <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> and, traditionally, a ceremonial dance is performed prior to combat.|$|E

25|$|Madhva, {{the founder}} of the Dvaita school, another sub-school of Vedanta, on the other hand, {{believes}} that there must be a root cause for variations in karma even if karma is accepted as having no beginning and being the cause of the problem of evil. Since jivas have different kinds of karma, from good to bad, all must not have started with same type of karma from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Thus, Madhva concludes that the jivas (souls) are not God's creation as in the Christian doctrine, but are rather entities co-existent with Vishnu, although under His absolute control. Souls are thus dependent on Him in their pristine nature and in all transformations that they may undergo.|$|E
25|$|Much of Egyptian mythology {{consists}} of origin myths, explaining {{the beginnings of}} various elements of the world, including human institutions and natural phenomena. Kingship arises among the gods at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and later passed to the human pharaohs; warfare originates when humans begin fighting each other after the sun god's withdrawal into the sky. Myths also describe the supposed beginnings of less fundamental traditions. In a minor mythic episode, Horus becomes angry with his mother Isis and cuts off her head. Isis replaces her lost head {{with that of a}} cow. This event explains why Isis was sometimes depicted with the horns of a cow as part of her headdress.|$|E
25|$|In The Atlantis Secret, Alford {{underlined}} {{the importance}} of cataclysms in ancient Greek myth and suggested that the Greek gods had inherited many characteristics from the older Mesopotamian deities. He cautioned, however, that the ancients’ belief in exploded planets did not require an actual explosion. Instead, he drew {{on the work of}} Victor Clube and Bill Napier to suggest that comets, fireballs and meteorites had been closely observed at the dawn of civilisation, and that the ancient sages had deduced an exploded planet, correctly or incorrectly, from first principles; the sages had then attributed the great cataclysm to <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> It should be noted, here, that there is an implied criticism of Velikovsky’s historicist interpretation of cataclysm myths.|$|E

500|$|Exterior {{shots of}} the alien world were shot in Iceland, where filming {{occurred}} for two weeks. It commenced on July 11, 2011, {{at the base of}} Hekla, an active volcano in southern Iceland. Speaking about working at the volcano, Scott said, [...] "If one is afraid of nature in this profession then {{it would be best to}} find a different job". Filming also took place at Dettifoss, one of the most powerful waterfalls in Europe. The Iceland shoot involved 160 Icelandic crew members and over 200 imported crew. Scott said that the filming in Iceland comprised approximately fifteen minutes of footage for the film, and that the area represented <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> Morocco had been chosen as a location for these scenes, but the 2010 Arab Spring protests forced the change of venue. Alternatives including the Mojave Desert had been considered, but Scott explained that Iceland was ultimately chosen because [...] "here it is so rough and 'Jurassic-like' and that proved decisive".|$|E
500|$|In the 1920s and 1930s {{almost every}} major {{cosmologist}} preferred an eternal steady state universe, and several complained that <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> {{implied by the}} Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady state theory. This perception was enhanced {{by the fact that}} the originator of the Big Bang theory, Georges Lemaître, was a Roman Catholic priest. Arthur Eddington agreed with Aristotle that the universe did not have a beginning in time, viz., that matter is eternal. A beginning in time was [...] "repugnant" [...] to him. Lemaître, however, thought thatIf the world has begun with a single quantum, the notions of space and time would altogether fail to have any meaning at the beginning; they would only begin to have a sensible meaning when the original quantum had been divided into a sufficient number of quanta. If this suggestion is correct, the beginning of the world happened a little before the beginning of space and time.|$|E

They are able to place the last Chaos Emerald in the shrine on the final continent at Eggman's new empire, [...] "Eggmanland", but are interrupted by him; Sonic then defeats Eggman who is using a robot that utilizes Dark Gaia's power. During the battle, the three sink into the core of the Earth and encounter [...] Dark Gaia. Eggman orders Dark Gaia to destroy Sonic, but it turns on him, knocking him away with one of its tentacles, and absorbs the power that turned Sonic into a Werehog, curing Sonic of lycanthropy, and uses that power to become Semi-Perfect Dark Gaia.|$|E

[...] Strang was accordingly crowned in 1850 by his counselor and Prime Minister, an actor named George J. Adams. About 300 people witnessed his coronation, for which he wore a bright red flannel robe topped by a white collar with black speckles. His tin crown was described in one account as [...] "a shiny metal ring with a cluster of glass stars in the front." [...] Strang also sported a breastplate and carried a wooden scepter. [...] His reign lasted six years, and the date of his coronation, July 8, is still mandated as one of the two most important dates in the Strangite church year (the other being April 6, the anniversary of the founding of Joseph Smith's church).|$|E
500|$|George N. Shorey's {{review of}} the initial seven reel Broadway release {{declared}} it another masterpiece of Mack's writing and notes that the film {{would be the best}} example to go before the courts to argue for [...] "free speech" [...] in films. Shorey notes that the propaganda film [...] "is bold, clear, tremendous in the force of its convincing showing that to drive the scarlet woman from a restricted district into the hotels and apartment houses of a city is a worse crime than it seeks to cure." [...] The only complaint was found that it [...] "does not sufficiently misrepresent the ease and luxury of the underworld. It shows a scarlet woman who finds the [...] "easiest way" [...] truly easy. She does not die, nor even suffer. The intended moral of the picture, that once abandoned to that life a woman finds it to her taste to remain in it and cannot be [...] "reformed," [...] necessarily does include the above corollary to that proposition." [...] The San Francisco Chronicle wrote that the film [...] "deals with a question that has perplexed the sages from <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and it traverses life's scroll, writing with thought and deed certain actions of everyday application. There are tense dramatic scenes, and above all there is the question that must be faced, [...] "Who's Your Neighbor?"" ...|$|E

I got off a plane and someone asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that I was standing on an orange crate at Speakers' Corner saying, 'Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?' I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, [...] "Chicken sandwiches in McDonald's are just plain fucking wrong," [...] it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in Tokyo. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in Chris Martin. So I am a guy who doesn't like hip-hop—shock, horror. I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't spoken to him , I heard he was reaching out. I don't bear any grudge, it's all good.
