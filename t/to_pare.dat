2500|$|Mel Gibson has {{credited}} his directors, particularly George Miller, Peter Weir, and Richard Donner, {{with teaching}} him {{the craft of}} filmmaking and influencing him as a director. According to Robert Downey, Jr., studio executives encouraged Gibson in 1989 to try directing, an idea he rebuffed at the time. Gibson made his directorial debut in 1993 with The Man Without a Face, followed two years later by Braveheart, which earned Gibson the Academy Award for Best Director. Gibson had long planned to direct a remake of Fahrenheit 451, but in 1999 the project was indefinitely postponed because of scheduling conflicts. Gibson was scheduled to direct Robert Downey, Jr. in a Los Angeles stage production of Hamlet in January 2001, but Downey's drug relapse ended the project. In 2002, while promoting We Were Soldiers and Signs to the press, Gibson mentioned that he was planning <b>to</b> <b>pare</b> back on acting and return to directing. In September 2002, Gibson {{announced that he would}} direct a film called The Passion in Aramaic and Latin with no subtitles because he hoped to [...] "transcend language barriers with filmic storytelling."

The film {{went on to become the}} highest grossing rated R film of all time with $370,782,930 in U.S. box office sales. Gibson directed a few episodes of Complete Savages for the ABC network. In 2006, he directed the action-adventure film Apocalypto, his second film to feature sparse dialogue in a non-English language. In November 2016, film critic Matt Zoller Seitz named Gibson as [...] "the pre-eminent religious filmmaker in the United States".|$|E
