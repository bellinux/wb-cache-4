5|$|A {{measure of}} William's success in taking control is <b>that,</b> <b>from</b> 1072 until the Capetian conquest of Normandy in 1204, William and his successors were largely {{absentee}} rulers. For example, after 1072, William {{spent more than}} 75 per cent {{of his time in}} France rather than England. While he needed to be personally present in Normandy to defend the realm from foreign invasion and put down internal revolts, he set up royal administrative structures that enabled him to rule England from a distance.|$|E

5|$|Directed by Bo Johan Renck, the {{accompanying}} music video was filmed at Ealing Studios in London on 17 August 2000. Renck had to specially edit the video because All Saints requested that each member shoot their scenes separately {{as they were}} not on speaking terms at the time. According {{to a report by}} the Daily Mirror, the group formed two camps with the Appletons on one side, and Lewis and Blatt on the other. Bullet time effects similar to <b>that</b> <b>from</b> the 1999 film The Matrix were used, being considered state of the art at the time. The video aired on 4 September 2000 to heavy rotation from MTV Europe.|$|E

5|$|Following the December 1983 {{release of}} the first album in the Now That's What I Call Music series, {{compilation}} albums featuring various artists became very popular in the UK during {{the mid to late}} 1980s; this is reflected in the albums that were Christmas number one during this time. From 1983 to 1987, every album {{at the top of the}} Christmas chart was a various artists compilation album, from either the Now That's What I Call Music or the Hits series. The UK Albums Chart was subsequently altered so <b>that,</b> <b>from</b> 14 January 1989, releases from various artists were no longer eligible for the main album chart.|$|E
