The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) determined that requiring hospitals to use safety-engineered needles would result in substantial savings due to the reduction in needlestick injuries requiring treatment.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesMany {{national}} {{colorectal cancer}} screening campaigns {{have a similar}} structure. First, individuals are invited to take a noninvasive screening test, and, second, {{in the case of}} a positive screening test result, they are advised to undergo a more invasive <b>follow-up</b> <b>test.</b> The objective of this study was to investigate how much individuals’ participation decision in noninvasive screening is affected by the presence or absence of detailed information about invasive <b>follow-up</b> <b>testing</b> and how this effect varies over screening tests. MethodsWe used a labeled discrete choice experiment of three noninvasive colorectal cancer screening types with two versions that did or did not present respondents with detailed information about the possible invasive <b>follow-up</b> <b>test</b> (i. e., colonoscopy) and its procedure. We used data from 631 Dutch respondents aged 55 to 75 years. Each respondent received only one of the two versions (N = 310 for the invasive <b>follow-up</b> <b>test</b> information specification version, and N = 321 for the no-information specification version). ResultsMixed logit model results show that detailed information about the invasive <b>follow-up</b> <b>test</b> negatively affects screening participation decisions. This effect can be explained mainly by a decrease in choice shares for the most preferred screening test (a combined stool and blood sample test). Choice share simulations based on the discrete choice experiment indicated that presenting invasive <b>follow-up</b> <b>test</b> information decreases screening participation by 4. 79 %.

According to revised {{classification}} criteria of true antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, {{at least one}} of three antiphospholipid antibodies should be present on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart. However, it can be inconvenient to perform <b>follow-up</b> <b>tests</b> with interval of 12 weeks. We investigated clinical application of <b>follow-up</b> <b>tests</b> with interval of 12 weeks. Method. Totals of 67, 199, and 332 patients tested positive initially for the lupus anticoagulants confirm, the anti-β 2 glycoprotein-I antibody, and the anti-cardiolipin antibody test, respectively, from Jan 2007 to Jul 2009.

Among patients with initial test positive, 1. 5 %– 8. 5 % were subjected to <b>follow-up</b> <b>tests</b> at interval of more than 12 weeks. Among 25 patients with negative conversion in tests, patients with interval of more than 12 weeks showed clinical symptom positivity of 33. 3 %, which was higher than that of 12. 5 % with 6 – 12 weeks.

Poor <b>test</b> result <b>follow-up</b> can have major consequences {{for the quality of}} care, including missed diagnoses and suboptimal patient outcomes. Over the last three decades there has been considerable {{growth in the number of}} requests for pathology and radiology services which has added to the complexity of how patient care is delivered and test results are managed.

OBJECTIVE: To {{systematically}} review evidence quantifying {{the extent of}} failure to <b>follow-up</b> <b>test</b> results and the impact for ambulatory patients. DATA SOURCES: Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Inspec and the Cochrane Database were searched for Englishlanguage literature from 1995 to 2010. STUDY SELECTION: Studies which provided documented quantitative evidence {{of the number of}} tests not followed up for patients attending ambulatory settings including: outpatient clinics, academic medical or community health centres, or primary care practices. DATA EXTRACTION: Four reviewers independently screened 768 articles. RESULTS: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria and reported wide variation in the extent of tests not followed-up: 6. 8 % (79 / 1163) to 62 % (125 / 202) for laboratory tests; 1. 0 % (4 / 395) to 35. 7 % (45 / 126) for radiology. The impact on patient outcomes included missed cancer diagnoses. Test management practices varied between settings with many individuals involved in the process. There were few guidelines regarding responsibility for patient notification and follow-up. Quantitative evidence of the effectiveness of electronic test management systems was limited although there was a general trend towards improved <b>test</b> <b>follow-up</b> when electronic systems were used. LIMITATIONS: Most studies used medical record reviews; hence evidence of follow-up action relied upon documentation in the medical record. All studies were conducted in the US so care should be taken in generalising findings to other countries.
