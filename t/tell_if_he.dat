5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} of Nebuchadnezzar II in the Book of Daniel (2nd century BC) greatly influenced the medieval European concepts. Daniel 4 depicts God humbling the Babylonian king for his boastfulness; stricken mad and ejected from human society, he grows {{hair on his}} body and lives like a beast. This image was popular in medieval depictions of Nebuchadnezzar. Similarly, late medieval legends of Saint John Chrysostom (died 407) describe the saint's asceticism as making him so isolated and feral that hunters who capture him cannot <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> is man or beast.|$|E
500|$|The {{design changes}} forced Kenny Myers to abdicate his other makeup job, that of Warner's Gorkon, to Margaret Bessera. Gorkon's {{appearance}} was of special concern to Meyer, {{who had two}} specific role models: Ahab and Abraham Lincoln. [...] " [...] loves to play the classics," [...] Kenny Myers explained, [...] "and incorporating these two images was really genius on his part. He wanted there to be uncertainty about Gorkon's true intentions. Did he want peace, or was there something sinister in his mind? From his appearance, {{it was impossible to}} <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was friend or foe. Subliminally, there were aspects of both." ...|$|E

500|$|Mega Man 3 {{brought new}} {{characters}} and gameplay mechanics to the franchise. Though Inafune considers the gameplay {{to have lost}} some of its simplicity, he felt Mega Man's slide ability was successfully implemented to enhance the player's control while battling enemies. Mega Man's sidekick dog Rush was designed by combining the functionality of three support tools from Mega Man 2, which would ease the player's navigation of stages. In addition to the Marine and Coil modes, Rush was originally intended to have a [...] "drill" [...] mode that would allow Mega Man to tunnel underground. Another new character, Proto Man, was introduced {{in a way that the}} player would be unable to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was an ally or an enemy to Mega Man. His design was influenced by anime, and he was given both a scarf and shield to make him appear [...] "tougher" [...] than Mega Man. The design team wanted Proto Man to sport uncovered hair, but they instead opted for an open-faced helmet illustration for both the television commercials and instruction manual. Proto Man's original Japanese name, Blues, was changed by Capcom's North American division despite Inafune's protests. Capcom did this not only to be consistent with Rockman's English name, but because they thought that the name Blues made no sense. Inafune attempted to defend it due to the name's musical connotation to character names in the series. Though Rush and Proto Man were created solely by the developer, Capcom sought ideas from fans for the creation of the game's Robot Masters as they had done with Mega Man 2. The team received around 50,000 design submissions for Mega Man 3, only eight of which were used in the game. Harumi Fujita, credited as [...] "Mrs. Tarumi", was the initial composer of the game, but she only completed a few songs before giving birth and having to drop off the project. She composed the songs ‘Needle Man’, ‘Gemini Man’ and ‘Staff Roll’. Capcom composer Yasuaki Fujita, also known as [...] "Bun Bun" [...] was then assigned to complete the soundtrack and created the majority of the score.|$|E
2500|$|At university, for a time, Reid {{became a}} member of the Communist Party of Great Britain of which he has said: [...] "I used to be a Communist. I used to believe in Santa Claus". The {{secretary}} of the Young Communist League, Jim White, who went to university with Reid, recalls: [...] "He told us he was a Leninist and Stalinist. Although I was suspicious about his transition, we couldn't <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was acting. We let him join." [...] On securing the support of the Communists and Labour students, Reid was able to run for president of the students' union and win the election. His political career had begun.|$|E
6000|$|He ruminated {{a moment}} and then said, in such a fashion that March could hardly <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were {{changing}} the subject or no: ...|$|E

60|$|Martin's {{face was}} inscrutable; {{one could not}} <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew or not. It was curious, but Jim could not {{take it for granted}} that he did know and he told him about the broken wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Thorn {{agreed and}} she could not <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew she had meant to be ironical. [...] "Anyhow, I don't suppose he wants to do much harm; I was {{thinking}} about his example." ...|$|E
60|$|They set off and Jake {{could not}} <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had excited his comrade's suspicions. Jim was {{sometimes}} reserved. Jake admitted {{that his own}} suspicions might not be justified, but he wondered {{what would have happened}} had he not moved out from the bank.|$|E

6000|$|... "There's nothing {{looks so}} nice as nails that are looked after good. I always think that's {{the best way}} to spot a real gent. There was an auto {{salesman}} in here yesterday that claimed you could always tell a fellow's class by the car he drove, but I says to him, 'Don't be silly,' I says; 'the wisenheimers grab a look at a fellow's nails when they want to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> a tin-horn or a real gent!"' ...|$|R

60|$|With a low bow, {{and without}} looking up, he took it. Again their pulses seemed to leap {{together}} with one accord {{and the same}} mysterious understanding. He could not <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had unconsciously pressed her hand or if she had returned the pressure. But when their hands unclasped {{it seemed as if}} it were the division of one flesh and spirit.|$|E
6000|$|... --You {{remind me}} of Antisthenes, the {{professor}} said, a disciple of Gorgias, the sophist. It is said of him that none could <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> were bitterer against others or against himself. He {{was the son of}} a noble and a bondwoman. And he wrote a book in which he took away the palm of beauty from Argive Helen and handed it to poor Penelope.|$|E
50|$|Before Quiller goes {{to check}} the house on his own, <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> Inge <b>if</b> <b>he</b> doesn't return in 20 minutes, she's to ring a certain number, Quiller asks her to memorise.|$|R
6000|$|He added, in {{a little}} while, 'Go yonder to my brother, and <b>tell</b> him, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{withdraw}} his troops, he shall be Earl of Northumberland, and rich and powerful in England.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I'll {{hesitate}} no longer," [...] she interposed firmly. [...] "Let the lad there ask me {{his dead}} brother's name and I'll tell him.... I'll <b>tell</b> him ... <b>if</b> <b>he</b> asks ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have been}} his slaves because their {{absolute}} obedience to his will {{was one of the}} conditions of his secrecy. He has drawn the cords too tight. Better let the truth be known, if needs be, than have their three lives broken. Don't let them go back under his governance. For me, I cannot <b>tell.</b> <b>If</b> <b>he</b> comes back, as he will come back, I may become his slave again, but let them break away. Listen--that is Mrs. Fentolin." ...|$|E
60|$|Then a {{stronger}} hope grew. It seemed that foot by foot Wildfire was gaining on the King. Slone studied the level forest floor sliding toward him. He lost his hope--then regained it again, {{and then he}} spurred the horse. Wildfire hated that as he hated Slone. But apparently he did not quicken his strides. And Slone could not <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> lengthened them. He was not running near his limit but, after the nature of such a horse, left to choose his gait, running slowly, but rising toward his swiftest and fiercest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good day, pretty one," [...] said he, [...] "and hast thou {{any need}} of glass beads, ribbons, combs, or trinkets? Here I am {{come all the}} way from Gruenstadt, with a pack full of such gay things as thou never laid eyes on before. Here be rings and bracelets and {{necklaces}} that might be of pure silver and set with diamonds and rubies, for anything that thy dear one could <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> saw thee decked in them. And all are so cheap that thou hast only to say, 'I want them,' and they are thine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wasn't--to say--sure," [...] said Sam; [...] "and I couldn't {{go and get}} {{him into}} a scrape. I thought <b>he</b> might <b>tell</b> himself, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could ever make up the money again!" ...|$|R

60|$|Except {{for some}} American and German merchants they saw few white people. The {{citizens}} were mulattos of different shades, negroes, and half-breeds who sprang from Spanish and Indian stock, {{although it was}} often hard to guess what blood ran in the Mestizos' veins. For the most part, they were a cheerful, careless lot; the coast basked in sunshine, with high, blue mountains for a background, and Marston felt nothing of the gloom and mystery that haunted the African rivers. At some of the ports Wyndham made arrangements for {{the extension of the}} house's trade, but Marston could not <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was satisfied or not.|$|E
60|$|Before {{opening the}} letters, {{he tried to}} {{recollect}} {{what had happened in}} Graham's office. The fellow sat in front of a desk with a row of pigeon-holes and sides that prevented Foster's noting exactly what he did after he began to write. In consequence, Foster could not <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had put anything except the letters in the envelopes, although he had taken some papers from the safe. It looked as if Graham had not meant him to see and had not trusted him altogether from the beginning. Now he probably knew he was an impostor, although this was not quite certain. Foster took out the envelopes, and broke the seal of the first, which was addressed to Daly, without hesitation.|$|E
60|$|He left Banff late at night, with {{a ticket}} for Vancouver, which he had bought on speculation, partly because the seaboard city is a clearing-house for {{travelers}} to {{all parts of the}} Pacific coast, but did not sleep much as the heavy train rumbled through the mountains. The jolting of the cars and the roar of wheels that echoed among the rocks disturbed him, and he was troubled by gloomy thoughts. He had promised Alice Featherstone that he would clear her brother; but he had also to clear himself, and in order to do so must find Lawrence as well as Daly. Just now he had not much hope of finding either, but he cherished a vague belief in his luck, and it was unthinkable that he should neglect any chance of justifying the girl's confidence. He was ready to follow Daly round the world, sooner than lose that. The trouble was that he could not <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was following the fellow or not.|$|E
5000|$|Abraham Lincoln {{loved the}} Nasby Letters, and quoted them frequently. He {{is quoted as}} saying, [...] "I intend to <b>tell</b> him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> will {{communicate}} his talent to me, I will swap places with him!" ...|$|R
