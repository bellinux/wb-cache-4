5|$|In response, Jacob Tonson and his associates, who {{controlled}} the copyright {{of the current}} edition of Shakespeare, threatened to sue Johnson and Cave in a letter written on 11 April 1745. <b>They</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> to protect their new edition, edited by the Shakespeare scholar William Warburton.|$|E

5|$|On the Confederate {{right flank}} {{a total of}} six {{batteries}} engaged the Federals, but <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> one-by-one instead of in unison, and each was consecutively cut to pieces by concentrated Union artillery fire. Moreover, they engaged the Union artillery later than the guns of the left flank, so the desired crossfire bombardment was never achieved.|$|E
5|$|Around midnight, {{the men of}} the 72nd and the 52nd passed Bab al-Wad noiselessly {{and then}} {{separated}} towards their respective targets. One company took Deir Ayyub, which was empty, but then were discovered as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> by enemies on a nearby hill. They suffered the joint fire of the Legion's artillery and machines guns. Thirteen men were killed and several other injured. The company, composed mainly of immigrants, then retreated to Bab al-Wad. The 52nd Battalion was preparing to take the hill in front of Yalu, but received an order to retreat.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{had only}} {{recently}} arrived {{in some of these}} kingdoms. Some had been converted by the Gregorian mission, a group of Roman missionaries who arrived in Kent in 597 and who mainly influenced southern Britain. Others had been converted by the Hiberno-Scottish mission, chiefly Irish missionaries working in Northumbria and neighbouring kingdoms. A few kingdoms, such as Dál Riata, became Christian but how <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> is unknown. The native Picts, according to the medieval writer Bede, were converted in two stages, initially by native Britons under Ninian, and subsequently by Irish missionaries.|$|E
5000|$|The idea of {{intrinsic}} finality presumes an objective reality that obeys a natural order or natural {{law in the}} universe. Things are [...] "meant" [...] to be and behave a certain way, and naturally tend to act that way. For instance, animals have natural instincts for self-preservation, seeking food, and reproduction. <b>They</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> because it is their nature to <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Theologians go further, to argue that <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> because <b>they</b> were created to <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|R

5|$|However, it {{was decided}} that the Common Assembly, which became the Parliament, should instead be based in Strasbourg—the Council of Europe (CoE) was already based there, in the House of Europe. The chamber of the CoE's Parliamentary Assembly could also serve the Common Assembly, and <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> until 1999, when a new complex of {{buildings}} was built across the river from the Palace.|$|E
5|$|Improvements in Norfolk's road {{infrastructure}} {{and the development}} of the stagecoach system made Norwich an increasingly popular destination with travellers. Norwich was recovering from the plague years and was a major city, with attractions and social events second only to London itself. The increasingly prosperous country landowners of Norfolk and Suffolk began visiting Norwich more frequently and staying for longer when <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1846, Dow spoke {{before the}} {{legislature}} {{in favor of}} statewide prohibition. The bill passed, but lacked the enforcement mechanisms necessary to give it effect. The following year, {{he ran for the}} state legislature in a special election, but was narrowly defeated. In 1850, now a member of the new Free Soil Party, he encouraged like-minded legislators to pass a stronger prohibition law. <b>They</b> <b>did</b> <b>so,</b> but saw it vetoed by Democratic governor John W. Dana. The legislature fell one vote short of overriding the veto.|$|E

On October 19, the Governor advised President Rutherford B. Hayes that the federal troops could be withdrawn. The Thirteenth Infantry departed the city on October 31, and Colonel Hartley's temporary forces departed in November 1877.|$|E
5|$|On September 2, 2009, the Sounders {{became the}} second MLS {{expansion}} team {{in league history}} (Chicago was the first) to win the U.S. Open Cup tournament in its first season. <b>They</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> by defeating D.C. United 2–1 on the road at RFK Stadium. In winning the U.S. Open Cup tournament, they qualified for the preliminary round of the 2010–11 CONCACAF Champions League.|$|E
5|$|The {{men of the}} 5th and 6th {{stayed at}} the depot {{throughout}} the night and into the next morning. If any individual needed to leave, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> in civilian clothes and unarmed, for fear of the crowd should they be discovered {{to be a member}} of the militia. Camden Street remained under constant guard by 16 sentinels. They served in two-hour shifts, with four-hours' rest in between.|$|E

5|$|Weisberger {{is widely}} {{believed}} to have based Miranda on Anna Wintour, the powerful editor of Vogue. Wintour reportedly warned major fashion designers who {{had been invited to}} make cameo appearances as themselves in the film that they would be banished from the magazine's pages if <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>so.</b> Vogue and other major women's and fashion magazines have avoided reviewing or even mentioning the book in their pages. Wintour's spokespeople deny the claim, but costume designer Patricia Field says many designers told her {{they did not want to}} risk Wintour's wrath.|$|E
5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|Early {{members of}} the group often proselytized on street corners for hours, and Clarence13X's assistants led classes about the group's teachings, {{strictly}} enforcing study habits. He instructed his followers to memorize his teachings on the significance of numbers and letters. Once <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>so,</b> they were said to gain an understanding of profound truths. These lessons were taught in a form that resembled catechisms. Rather than hold services in mosques, they gathered for monthly meetings known as parliaments, which were often held outdoors. Attendees were given wide freedom to speak in a system that Ted Swedenburg of the University of Arkansas has compared to Quaker meetings.|$|E

5|$|Isaac D'Israeli {{had never}} taken {{religion}} very seriously, but had remained a conforming member of the Bevis Marks Synagogue. His father, the elder Benjamin, was a prominent and devout member; it was probably from respect for him that Isaac did not leave when he fell out with the synagogue authorities in 1813. After Benjamin senior died in 1816 Isaac felt free to leave the congregation following a second dispute. Isaac's friend Sharon Turner, a solicitor, convinced him that although he could comfortably remain unattached to any formal religion it would be disadvantageous to the children if <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>so.</b> Turner stood as godfather when Benjamin was baptised, aged twelve, on 31 July 1817.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{were the}} reigning European Cup champions after {{defeating}} Borussia Mönchengladbach 3–1 {{to win the}} 1977 European Cup Final. Liverpool were also the reigning English champions, having won the English league during the 1976–77 season. As reigning European Cup champions, they received a bye in the first round. They were drawn against East German champions Dynamo Dresden in the second round. Liverpool were expected to win the first leg, played at Anfield, their home ground, and <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> with a score of 5–1. Dresden won the second leg 2-1 at their home ground, Glücksgas Stadium, giving Liverpool a 6–3 win on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|OTU squadrons, {{according}} to GOC Bowhill, {{should have been}} prepared to deliver an output of three crews per month for torpedo and fighter squadrons and two for General Reconnaissance units. Only at this point did the Air Ministry revise its policy. <b>They</b> <b>did</b> <b>so,</b> however, in a manner which indicated it still did not appreciate {{the problems of the}} Command. Bomber Command had received several months of 'working up' and breathing space from the declaration of war to the German invasion of Western Europe, but Coastal Command had not. Furthermore, Bomber Command was given permission to merge several new squadrons into OTUs. It seemed as if Bomber Command was still receiving better treatment.|$|E

VET teachers in schools play and will continue to play a key role.|$|R
