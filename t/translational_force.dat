25|$|A load on a {{framework}} {{is a system}} of forces on the vertices (represented as vectors). A stress is a special case of a load, in which equal and opposite forces are applied to the two endpoints of each edge (which may be imagined as a spring) and the forces formed in this way are added at each vertex. Every stress is an equilibrium load, a load that does not impose any <b>translational</b> <b>force</b> on the whole system (the sum of its force vectors is zero) nor any rotational force. A linear dependence among the rows of the rigidity matrix may be represented as a self-stress, an assignment of equal and opposite forces to the endpoints of each edge that is not identically zero but that adds to zero at every vertex. Thus, a set of edges forms an independent set in the rigidity matroid {{if and only if}} it has no self-stress.|$|E
50|$|A {{reaction}} wheel (RW) {{is a type}} of flywheel used primarily by spacecraft for attitude control without using fuel for rockets or other reaction devices. They are particularly useful when the spacecraft must be rotated by very small amounts, such as keeping a telescope pointed at a star. They may also reduce the mass fraction needed for fuel. This is accomplished by equipping the spacecraft with an electric motor attached to a flywheel which, when its rotation speed is changed, causes the spacecraft to begin to counter-rotate proportionately through conservation of angular momentum. Reaction wheels can rotate a spacecraft only around its center of mass (see torque); they are not capable of moving the spacecraft {{from one place to another}} (see <b>translational</b> <b>force).</b> Reaction wheels work around a nominal zero rotation speed. However, external torques on the spacecraft may require a gradual buildup of {{reaction wheel}} rotation speed to maintain the spacecraft in a fixed orientation.|$|E

The armature, therefore, has a totally passive design. Because of its salient structure, a <b>translational</b> <b>force</b> {{can be produced}} for motion of the armature. The magnets create a passive attraction force for failsafe operation, which can be controlled for magnetically suspending the armature.

40|$|We used a {{dynamically}} scaled model insect {{to measure}} the rotational forces produced by a flapping insect wing. A steadily translating wing was rotated at a range of constant angular velocities, and the resulting aerodynamic forces were measured using a sensor attached {{to the base of}} the wing. These instantaneous forces were compared with quasi-steady estimates based on <b>translational</b> <b>force</b> coefficients. Because translational and rotational velocities were constant, the wing inertia was negligible, and any difference between measured forces and estimates based on <b>translational</b> <b>force</b> coefficients could be attributed to the aerodynamic effects of wing rotation. By factoring out the geometry and kinematics of the wings from the rotational forces, we determined rotational force coefficients for a range of angular velocities and different axes of rotation. The measured coefficients were compared with a mathematical model developed for two-dimensional motions in inviscid fluids, which we adapted to the three-dimensional case using blade element theory. As predicted by theory, the rotational coefficient varied linearly with the position of the rotational axis for all angular velocities measured. The coefficient also, however, varied with angular velocity, in contrast to theoretical predictions. Using the measured rotational coefficients, we modified a standard quasi-steady model of insect flight to include rotational forces, translational forces and the added mass inertia. The revised model predicts the time course of force generation for several different patterns of flapping kinematics more accurately than a model based solely on <b>translational</b> <b>force</b> coefficients.

Closed pure lipid bilayer membranes (vesicles) {{have been widely used}} for the experimental and theoretical studies of cellular biomechanics under this electrodeformation. An alternative method used to generate an electric field is by electromagnetic induction with a time-varying magnetic field. References reporting the magnetic control of cellular mechanics have recently emerged. However, theoretical analysis of the cellular mechanics under a time-varying magnetic field is inadequate. We developed an analytical theory to investigate the biomechanics of a modeled vesicle under a time-varying magnetic field. Following previous publications and to simplify the calculation, this model treated the inner and suspending media as lossy dielectrics, the membrane thickness set at zero, and the electric resistance of the membrane assumed to be negligible. This work provided the first analytical solutions for the surface charges, electric field, radial pressure, overall <b>translational</b> <b>forces,</b> and rotational torques introduced on a vesicle by the time-varying magnetic field. Frequency responses of these measures were analyzed, particularly the frequency used clinically by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Results The induced surface charges interacted with the electric field to produce a biomechanical impact upon the vesicle. The distribution of the induced surface charges depended on the orientation of the coil and field frequency. The densities of these charges were trivial at low frequency ranges, but significant at high frequency ranges. The direction of the radial force on the vesicle was dependent on the conductivity ratio between the vesicle and the medium. At relatively low frequencies (3 ̆c 200 3 ̆eKHz), including the frequency used in TMS, the computed radial pressure and <b>translational</b> <b>forces</b> on the vesicle were both negligible.

The DAM {{is a pair of}} actuators that control the length or tension of a single wire, generating a large <b>translational</b> <b>force</b> that greatly accelerates the top plate. Because the actuators are positioned outside of the top plate, the top plate develops low inertia and achieves high-acceleration motions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of glenohumeral conformity on interface micromotions in a metal backed glenoid implant. A force controlled experiment was performed in which a metal backed glenoid component with various PE inlay radii was subjected to a simulated joint reaction force. Local interface micromotions, rim displacement and bone substitute deformation were measured using DVRT sensors. All measured variables were significantly larger (p< 0. 05) in the non-conform inlay with radial mismatch 6 mm, compared to the conform inlay. These findings are contrary to previous reports by other authors who found that a larger mismatch not only reduces interface micromotions but <b>translational</b> <b>forces</b> and bone strains as well. The reason for these contradicting findings is the fact that in the present study a force controlled experiment was performed as opposed to a displacement controlled experiment. A non-conform inlay allows for a larger humeral head translation in the inlay. This causes a larger resultant moment on the metal back that opens the bone-implant interface. It is concluded that as glenohumeral mismatch increases relative micromotions, rim displacements and bone deformations increase, reducing the chance of vital bone ingrowth to occur.

40|$|Vibrating {{machinery}} must {{be isolated}} from a supporting structure if the vibration {{is likely to}} cause fatigue of components or annoyance to people due to direct vibration exposure or from the noise radiated by the vibrating structure. Active vibration isolation can be applied in these situations to extend the low frequency performance of passive vibration isolators. In this thesis, theoretical and experimental investigations are described for a vibrating rigid body that is passively and actively isolated from a beam and a cylinder, respectively. The focus {{of the work is}} to investigate the vibrational power transmitted by <b>translational</b> <b>forces</b> and rotational moments into the support structure. For the investigation of the simply supported beam, a classical mathematical model is examined and finite element modelling is used to predict the power transmission into the beam when active vibration control is used. The results show that power transmission by moments is significant and cannot be ignored when the vibrational power transmission into the support structure is actively controlled. To control the power transmission by <b>translational</b> <b>forces</b> and rotational moments, a novel six axis active vibration isolator and a novel six axis force transducer were constructed {{to be used in the}} experimental investigations. Using vibrational power transmission as a cost function to be minimized in active control experiments presents unique problems because negative values of translational power transmission are possible when power transmission from rotational moments is ignored or when phase errors occur in the transducer outputs. Active control attempts which converge the cost function to a negative value of power transmission along a particular axis can result in overall vibration levels in the structure which are greater than without active control. To prevent the increase in vibration levels, minimization of the squared value of power transmission is investigated as a potential cost function. A method is described to combine force and velocity signals into a signal which is proportional to the vibrational power transmission and is suitable for use with an existing filtered-x Least Mean Squares controller, so that the squared vibrational power transmission can be minimized. Experimental trials were performed to actively minimize the power transmission into a simply supported beam from a vibrating rigid body using a single axis and a six axis active vibration isolator. The purpose of the experimental work was to confirm the theoretical findings and to find a practical method to measure power transmitted by rotational moments. The vibrational power transmission from a vibrating rigid body that is passively and actively isolated from a cylinder was also investigated. The theoretical model of the cylinder was similar to the beam model, although the dynamics of the cylinder makes the solution more complicated. Two experimental trials were conducted to verify the theoretical model and involved the use of the single axis and the six axis active vibration isolators, respectively. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Suture tabs allow for full control over the expander position and thus inframammary fold position, and, in theory, tabbed expanders mitigate many factors responsible for poor symmetry. The impact of a tabbed expander on breast symmetry, however, has not been formally reported. This study aims to evaluate breast symmetry following expander-implant reconstruction using tabbed and non-tabbed tissue expanders. Methods A chart review was performed of 188 consecutive expander-implant reconstructions that met the inclusion criteria of adequate follow-up data and postoperative photographs. Demographic, oncologic, postoperative complication, and photographic data was obtained for each patient. The photographic data was scored using a 4 -point scale assessing breast symmetry by three blinded, independent reviewers. Results Of the 188 patients, 74 underwent reconstruction with tabbed expanders and 114 with non-tabbed expanders. The tabbed cohort had significantly higher symmetry scores than the non-tabbed cohort (2. 82 / 4 ± 0. 86 vs. 2. 55 / 4 ± 0. 92, P= 0. 034).

Full scale coupled non-linear dynamics are examined experimentally {{at one of the}} worlds’ most powerful air blast testing facilities. Evaluating structural response to blast loads of this magnitude is exceptionally difficult using only computational fluid dynamics; typically not achievable without incurring unmanageable solution domains. Clearing, diffraction and exhaust of a long-duration blast wave across any comparatively small structure imposes constraints leading to the use of approximated drag coefficients, designed primarily to expedite the calculation of net <b>translational</b> <b>forces.</b> In this research, detailed pressure histories measured experimentally {{on the surface of the}} cylindrical shell are used to accurately configure a computational analysis dispensing with the requirement to utilise approximated drag forces. When further combined with accurate material test data, fibre optic controlled strain gauge instrumentation and high-speed video photography, a full comparative model was possible. This paper shows that without exact knowledge of long-duration flow-field effects a priori, it is very difficult to reliably determine the mode of structural response and degree of blast resistance. Preliminary modelling predicted a global sway and localised plate buckling; however, subsequent experimental testing showed a crushing failure of the shell before any translational movement occurred.

40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{is one of}} the world’s leading causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality among young individuals. TBI applies powerful rotational and <b>translational</b> <b>forces</b> to the brain parenchyma, which results in a traumatic diffuse axonal injury (DAI) responsible for brain swelling and neuronal death. Following TBI, axonal degeneration has been identified as a progressive process that starts with disrupted axonal transport causing axonal swelling, followed by secondary axonal disconnection and Wallerian degeneration. These modifications in the axonal cytoskeleton interrupt the axoplasmic transport mechanisms, causing the gradual gathering of transport products so as to generate axonal swellings and modifications in neuronal homeostasis. Oxidative stress with consequent impairment of endogenous antioxidant defense mechanisms plays {{a significant role in the}} secondary events leading to neuronal death. Studies support the role of an altered axonal calcium homeostasis as a mechanism in the secondary damage of axon, and suggest that calcium channel blocker can alleviate the secondary damage, as well as other mechanisms implied in the secondary injury, and could be targeted as a candidate for therapeutic approaches. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) -mediated axonal degeneration is mainly caused by extracellular Ca 2 +. Increases in the defense mechanisms through the use of exogenous antioxidants may be neuroprotective, particularly if they are given within the neuroprotective time window. A promising potential therapeutic target for DAI is to directly address mitochondria-related injury or to modulate energetic axonal energy failure...|$|R
