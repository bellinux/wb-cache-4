5|$|As {{popular as}} their {{cartoons}} were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios {{to go out}} of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many people in the industry out of work. Hanna–Barbera was key in the development of limited animation, which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective, but also reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques {{in the early days of}} Tom and Jerry. To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation. The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Reviewers criticized the change from vivid, detailed animation to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna–Barbera <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>business,</b> providing employment to many who would otherwise have been out of work. Limited animation became the standard for television animation, and continues to be used today in television programs such as The Simpsons and South Park.|$|E

One {{of the most important}} developments which occurred in the field of quality improvement theories in {{the last decade of the}} twentieth century was the recognition of measuring customer satisfaction as a major requirement of quality management systems in all institutions and commercial enterprises. Satisfying customers is an essential element <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>in</b> this modern world of global competition. In this study, the most important qualitative dimensions in the banks‟ providing of internet services have been put forth. A comprehensive and accurate questionnaire has then been designed in accord to these aspects and the rate of customer satisfaction to the quality of Melli Bank‟s internet services has been measured through the use of a suggested model. The ultimate result is a set of solutions and suggestions which can be effective strategies in improving the quality of internet services in the mentioned bank. It should be mentioned that the number of internet banking services of Melli Bank in the city of Shiraz was not large and the questionnaires had been handed out to them by the branch managers, thus random selection of customers for the survey has not been possible. However, the amount obtained by Cronbach‟s alpha reliability and validity factor in the third chapter, asserts the accuracy and reliability of the research method conducted in this study...|$|R

50|$|Sustainable {{management}} is needed {{because it is}} an important part of the ability to successfully maintain the quality of life on our planet. Sustainable management can be applied to all aspects of our lives. For example, the practices of a business should be sustainable if they wish <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>businesses,</b> because if the business is unsustainable, then by the definition of sustainability they will cease to be able to be in competition. Communities are in a need of sustainable management, because if the community is to prosper, then the management must be sustainable. Forest and natural resources need to have sustainable management if they are to be able to be continually used by our generation and future generations. Our personal lives also need to be managed sustainably. This can be by making decisions that will help sustain our immediate surroundings and environment, or it can be by managing our emotional and physical well-being. Sustainable management can be applied to many things, as it can be applied as a literal and an abstract concept. Meaning, depending on what they are applied to the meaning of what it is can change.|$|R
