After 3G purchased Burger King, its new management team refocused on a broader menu strategy to lure a more diverse customer base. The first major change <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> base was a reformulation and name change of the company's chicken nuggets in January 2013. Along with other new products such as smoothies, wraps and chicken strips that broadly copied McDonald's menu once again, the chain reintroduced the Big King as a permanent menu item in November of the same year.|$|E
5|$|Znám's problem {{concerns}} sets {{of numbers}} such that each number in the set divides but is not equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> {{of all the other}} numbers, plus one. Without the inequality requirement, the values in Sylvester's sequence would solve the problem; with that requirement, it has other solutions derived from recurrences similar to the one defining Sylvester's sequence. Solutions to Znám's problem have applications to the classification of surface singularities (Brenton and Hill 1988) and to the theory of nondeterministic finite automata.|$|E
5|$|The {{heterodyne}} technique {{is used for}} (1) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as (2) amplifying a weak input signal (assuming use of an active mixer). A weak input signal of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong reference frequency f2 from a local oscillator (LO). The nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals, one at the sum f1+f2 of the two frequencies, and the other at the difference f1−f2. These new frequencies are called heterodynes. Typically {{only one of the}} new frequencies is desired, and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the mixer. The output signal will have an intensity proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> of the amplitudes of the input signals.|$|E

2500|$|Therefore, the {{geometric}} {{structure of a}} state can be predicted by comparing its energy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> species neighboring it along the reaction coordinate. [...] For example, in an exothermic reaction the transition state is closer in energy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reactants than <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>products.</b> [...] Therefore, <b>the</b> transition state will be more geometrically similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reactants than <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>products.</b> [...] In contrast, however, in an endothermic reaction the transition state is closer in energy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> than <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reactants. [...] So, according <b>to</b> Hammond’s postulate <b>the</b> structure of the transition state would resemble <b>the</b> <b>products</b> more than <b>the</b> reactants. [...] This type of comparison is especially useful because most transition states cannot be characterized experimentally.|$|R
5|$|To predict if the {{production}} of mendelevium would be possible, the team made use of a rough calculation. The number of atoms that would be produced would be approximately equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> {{of the number of}} atoms of target material, the target's cross section, the ion beam intensity, and the time of bombardment; this last factor was related to the half-life of the product when bombarding for a time on the order of its half-life. This gave one atom per experiment. Thus under optimum conditions, the preparation of only one atom of element 101 per experiment could be expected. This calculation demonstrated that it was feasible {{to go ahead with the}} experiment. The target material, einsteinium-253, could be produced readily from irradiating plutonium: one year of irradiation would give a billion atoms, and its three-week half-life meant that the element 101 experiments could be conducted in one week after the produced einsteinium was separated and purified to make the target. However, it was necessary to upgrade the cyclotron to obtain the needed intensity of 1014 alpha particles per second; Seaborg applied for the necessary funds.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to green product development by identifying <b>the</b> green <b>products</b> with <b>the</b> highest potential for growth in a country. To address our aim, we use <b>the</b> concept of <b>product</b> proximity and product space and, borrowing {{from the results}} of recent studies on complexity economics, we advance that <b>the</b> green <b>products</b> with <b>the</b> highest potential for growth among all green products in a given country are those being in close proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> a country produces with high Relative Comparative Advantage (RCA). We test this hypothesis performing a regression analysis.

Results confirm that green products with high maximum proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>products</b> with high RCA had the highest growth.

50|$|When a {{reactant}} {{can form}} two different <b>products</b> depending on <b>the</b> reaction conditions, it becomes important <b>to</b> choose <b>the</b> right conditions <b>to</b> favor <b>the</b> desired <b>product.</b> If a reaction {{is carried out}} at relatively lower temperature, then <b>the</b> <b>product</b> formed is one lying across the smaller energy barrier.
