5|$|The six British <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> {{board the}} Infantry Landing Ships, HMS Princess Astrid and HMS Maid of Orleans {{and the two}} French <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> LCIs 523 and 527 left the Solent on 5 June 1944. When out at sea they were {{informed}} that the invasion {{was going to be}} in Normandy and more specifically Ouistreham.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{received}} {{word of the}} landings the same day, but was informed that the number was 8,000 to 9,000 troops. This convinced {{him that it was}} the feint which he had predicted and therefore he only sent 1,500 more troops to Brooklyn, bringing the total number of <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> Long Island to 6,000. On August 24, Washington replaced Sullivan with Israel Putnam who commanded the <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> Long Island. Putnam arrived on Long Island the next day along with six battalions. Also that day, the British <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> Long Island received 5,000 Hessian reinforcements, bringing their total to 20,000. There was little fighting on the days immediately after the landing, although some small skirmishes did take place with American marksmen armed with rifles picking off British troops from time to time.|$|E
5|$|A {{modified}} version of the standard MP 40 (sometimes erroneously called MP 40/II) with a dual side-by-side magazine holder (for a theoretical ammunition total of 64 rounds), designed for special operations <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> the Eastern Front to compensate for the enemies' PPSh-41 larger magazine capacity. However, the design proved unsuccessful due to weight and reliability issues.|$|E

5|$|In both respects, {{little was}} {{achieved}} this day. The planned counterattack by the Light Division against the airborne <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> IJsselmonde failed. In {{the nick of}} time the bridge over the river Noord had been prepared for defence by the German paratroopers, and it proved impossible to force it. Several attempts to cross the river by boat managed only to establish a few isolated bridgeheads, and at 10:15 the Light Division was given permission to break off the crossing at this point and ordered to shift its axis of attack by reinforcing Dutch <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> the Island of Dordrecht, where it arrived that night. After clearing the Island of Dordrecht of enemy troops the division was to advance into IJsselmonde over the Dordrecht bridge in order to reach Rotterdam.|$|E
5|$|Mary was {{released}} from the captivity by Sigismund's <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> 4 June.

5|$|Shortly thereafter, the Spartan fleet under Gorgopas ambushed the Athenian fleet near Athens, {{capturing}} several ships. The Athenians {{responded with}} an ambush of their own; Chabrias, {{on his way}} to Cyprus, landed his <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> Aegina and laid an ambush for the Aeginetans and their Spartan allies, killing a number of them including Gorgopas.|$|E
5|$|There {{they were}} {{blockaded}} until 14 April, when Cochrane removed this threat. A British force under Major-General Frederick Maitland and Captain Philip Beaver in , landed <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> the islands capturing them. The British then installed heavy guns on vantage points.|$|E
5|$|While brutal, the Indonesian 'encirclement and annihilation' {{campaign}} of 1977–1978 {{was effective in}} that it broke {{the back of the}} main Fretilin militia.

5|$|As {{early as}} 16 April, the German command {{realised}} that the British were evacuating <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> ships at Volos and Piraeus. The campaign then {{took on the}} character of a pursuit. For the Germans, it was now primarily a question of maintaining contact with the retreating British forces and foiling their evacuation plans. German infantry divisions were withdrawn due to their limited mobility. The 2nd and 5th Panzer Divisions, the 1st SS Motorised Infantry Regiment and both mountain divisions launched a pursuit of the Allied forces.|$|E
5|$|As the Russians withdrew, the French {{immediately}} despatched garrisons to the Ionian Islands, rapidly amassing over 7,400 French and Neapolitan <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> Corfu alone. This effectively {{turned the}} Adriatic into a sheltered French sea {{from which they}} could be free to despatch raiders against British convoys, colonies and Royal Navy blockade squadrons, which had controlled the Mediterranean since the Battle of Trafalgar two years earlier. To facilitate this, the French Navy placed significant orders at the Venetian naval yards, intending to build forces in the region with locally produced and crewed vessels.|$|E

5|$|At {{approximately}} 3:30am 20 SEALs {{and about}} 24 US Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment (wearing night-vision goggles) approached the compound, fast roping from two CH-47 Chinook helicopters. They were fired {{on from the}} compound and from a nearby position by Taliban armed with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades, and suicide vests. Two American snipers aboard a helicopter killed two guards using sound-suppressed rifles. An AC-130 Spectre gunship provided the US <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> the ground with close air support, killing two fleeing Taliban. The Rangers secured enemy positions on the nearby hills, and all six Taliban gunmen who fought the US forces were killed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 14thcentury, the westernmost Mongol territories had become subject to {{frequent}} Polish and Hungarian military offensives. Grand Prince Olgierd of Lithuania penetrated farther into the territories controlled by the Golden Horde than any European army had hitherto done.

5|$|During the English Civil War the Royalist Earl of Bath {{tried to}} raise troops in Cullompton but met {{resistance}} from local people. Troops passed through Cullompton on several occasions during the civil war: Sir Ralph Hopton rode with a small troop though the town {{on his way to}} Cornwall; Cornish Royalist forces marched through Cullompton on their way to join Prince Maurice at Chard as did The Earl of Essex and Thomas Fairfax. There were also <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> the streets of Cullompton again in 1655 during Penruddock's Uprising.|$|E

5|$|During the battle, however, North Korean {{troops were}} able to {{surprise}} US <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> Hill 303 and capture them. Late in the battle, these troops were machine gunned in the Hill 303 massacre. Despite these setbacks, the UN forces were successful in driving most of the North Koreans off, but the decisive battle to secure the city would occur during the Battle of the Bowling Alley.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} week of August, US <b>troops</b> <b>on</b> these hills could see minor North Korean {{activity}} across the river, which they thought were North Koreans organizing the high ground {{on the west side of}} the Naktong against a possible American attack. There were occasional attacks on the 9th Infantry's forward positions, but to the men in the front lines this appeared to be only a standard patrol action. On August 31, the UN forces were alerted to a pending attack when much of the Korean civilian labor force fled the front lines. Intelligence officers reported an attack was coming.|$|E
5|$|Early on May 6, three Royal Navy ships sailed into Quebec Harbour. <b>Troops</b> <b>on</b> {{these ships}} were {{immediately}} sent {{into the city}} and, not long after, General Guy Carleton formed them up and marched {{them out to the}} American siege camp. General John Thomas, then in command of the American forces, had already been making arrangements to retreat, but the British arrival threw his troops into a panic. He led a disorganized retreat that eventually reached Sorel on about May 18.|$|E
