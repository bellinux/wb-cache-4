5|$|Another likely {{literary}} {{source is}} the plague narrative in the Book of Exodus, in which Egypt {{is covered by}} darkness for three days. It has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of Matthew's gospel changed the Marcan text slightly to more closely match this source. Commentators have also drawn comparisons with the description of darkness in the Genesis creation narrative, with a prophecy regarding mid-day darkness by Jeremiah, and with an end-times prophecy in the Book of Zechariah.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{also noted}} that the fatwa covered a wide range of Islamic {{religious}} duties, while usually a responsum fatwa only addresses a specific enquiry on a difficult point of detail. The fatwa also went into specific practical challenges faced by Muslims in Spain, such as the pressure to curse Muhammad, eat pork, drink wine, and intermarry with the Christians. This suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> had some knowledge of what life under Christian rule was like.|$|E

5|$|By {{the second}} {{decade of the}} 21st century, the overall {{consensus}} supported the position {{that there was only}} a single author who was writing either {{at the end of the}} 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. Further, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to Cicero and Ammianus Marcellinus in a complex allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.|$|E
5|$|Later {{commenting on}} this source, Maylam {{highlighted}} that its author {{did not appear}} to be from Kent and that, from their use of wording, it appeared that they had been told about the tradition by locals but had not actually witnessed it first hand. As such, Maylam suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> may have been wrong in describing the use of a horse's skull in the Ramsgate tradition, given that both later sources and the hoodeners of his own time all used a wooden model of a horse's head. At the same time, Maylam noted that the use of a horse's skull was not impossible, for such skulls had also been used in the hobby horse traditions of other parts of Britain.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{elements}} of the novel <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> found most poignant was that of class division and how there is a subset of people who have access to a world of power and wealth that the vast majority will never experience, of which Gibson cited Brown and his evidently routine use of a private jet as an example. The author felt {{that at the time of}} writing, such social chasms were widening, and drew parallels to the Victorian era as well as to the world of his breakthrough novel Neuromancer (1984) in which there is no middle class, only the super-rich and a predominantly criminal underclass.|$|E
5|$|Other {{theories}} include André Chastagnol's minimalist opinion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> was a pagan {{who supported}} the Senate and the Roman aristocracy and scorned the lower classes and the barbarian races, while François Paschoud proposed that the last books of the History are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative, with events and the personalities of recent 4th century emperors woven {{into the fabric of}} a series of 3rd century emperors. According to Paschoud, the representation of the emperor Probus is in fact a version of Julian, with Carus substituting for Valentinian I and Carinus for Gratian.|$|E
5|$|Teapot: The teapot {{was invented}} during the Yuan Dynasty, tea {{preparation}} in previous dynasties did not utilize a teapot. In the Tang Dynasty, a cauldron {{was used to}} boil grounded tea, which was served in bowls. Song Dynasty tea was made by pouring water boiled using a kettle into a bowl with finely ground tea leaves. A brush was then used to stir the tea. The innovation of the teapot, a vessel that steeps tea leaves in boiling water, occurs during the late Yuan dynasty. Written evidence of a teapot appears in the Yuan Dynasty text, Jiyuan Conghua, which describes a teapot <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> Cai Shizhan, bought from the scholar Sun Daoming. By the Ming Dynasty, teapots were widespread in China.|$|E

5|$|The {{events leading}} to the {{destruction}} of the royal palace did not cause the destruction of the whole city. The Shattiwaza treaty, which describes the events of the first Syrian war, mentions that Qatna was invaded and destroyed, and its people were deported during the war. However, Idanda's successor, Akizzi, was ruling {{in the second half of}} the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten's reign following the first Syrian war, or shortly before the second Syrian war. This discrepancy can be explained if the treaty did not mention the events in a chronological order; many scholars, such as Wilhelm, believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of the document organized the text according to the principle of association, rather than following the sequence of events.|$|E
5|$|Writing for the Hartford Courant, Bill Williams {{stated that}} the book should be {{mandatory}} reading for {{high school and college}} students. Anne Phillips wrote in her review for The News-Gazette that the book is a concise and well-written description of the conflicts the country faces when grappling with the notions of freedom of expression, free speech, and freedom of the press. Writing for The Christian Science Monitor, Chuck Leddy noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> helps readers understand the importance of freedom of speech in a democracy, especially during a period of military conflict when there is increased controversy over the appropriateness of dissent and open dialogue.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} the book in the Leiden Journal of International Law by Tamás Hoffmann {{recommends}} the work to multiple potential readers, including those who engage in targeting killing, academics, and students. Hoffmann calls it a well-researched monograph and helpful reference work on the subject. The review places the book {{within the context of}} addressing legal issues inherent in debating the murky concept of targeted killing. Hoffmann states the book furthers prior attempts to come to a resolution {{on the question of the}} practice's legality. Helen Durhan praises the writing quality of Melzer's work, in a review for the Australian Year Book of International Law. Durhan writes the work is organized in an easily readable format and covers the topic with neutrality. She goes on to call the book a work representing the need for concerned discussion prior to implementing any policy involved in eliminating people. Of the author's focus throughout the work, Durhan observes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> handles discussion of the legality of targeted killing in a clear and precise manner. The review concludes Melzer's thorough analysis goes a long way towards furthering scholars' impressions of legal issues surrounding when it is permitted for sovereign governments to kill people.|$|E

My contention is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author’s</b> fail to accomplish their goal. To show this, I argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> are inconsistent, <b>that</b> Singer has previously provided an account of impartiality that makes it just as unreliable on the same grounds as self-interested tendencies. By showing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> fail to address the actual target of Street’s dilemma, their argument and conclusion are overstated and that Sidgwick’s duality remains unresolved...|$|R

5|$|In early 1891, Berlin society {{erupted in}} scandal {{after a series}} of {{anonymous}} letters circulated to prominent members of the court, including Wilhelm and his wife Dona. The letters were written in the same handwriting, and featured salacious gossip, accusations, and intrigues among the court's powerful. Some included pornographic images layered upon royal photographs. Several hundred letters were sent over a four-year period. Wilhelm ordered an investigation, but the writer (or writers) were never identified. Some contemporaries speculated that Charlotte, known for her sharp tongue and love of gossip, may have been responsible. Historians have since suggested that the writer may have been Dona's brother Duke Ernst Gunther of Schleswig-Holstein in collaboration with his mistress. It is clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> had an intimate understanding of the many personalities within the royal family, likely making him or her either a family member or courtier.|$|E
5|$|India Knight, {{a novelist}} and {{columnist}} for The Sunday Times, tweeted on 9 July 2013 {{that she had}} been reading The Cuckoo's Calling and thought it was good for a début novel.

Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation. After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, he sent the books for linguistic analysis which found similarities, and subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym. Within days of Rowling being revealed as the author, sales of the book rose by 4,000%, and Little Brown printed another 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand. , a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (£2,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (£3,950).|$|E
5|$|The Leges {{was written}} between 1114 and 1118 {{by an unknown}} Norman, who is very {{likely to be the}} author of another legal work, the Quadripartitus, {{although}} some historians, including H. G. Richardson and G. O. Sayles, argue that the two works were by different authors. The Leges was probably part of a project including the Quadripartitus, the two works being part of a planned work in four volumes to cover not only the laws of the writer's own time, but previous laws of the Anglo-Saxon monarchs, as well as how to handle legal cases. As part of both works, the author has included the Charter of Liberties, which was King Henry's coronation charter promising not to follow the administrative and legal policies of his predecessor, King William II. About a third of the material in the Leges is also in the Quadripartitus. There is evidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> of the two works {{had been a member of}} the household of Gerard, who had been chancellor under Kings William I and William II before becoming Archbishop of York under Henry I. The work was likely composed at Winchester.|$|E
