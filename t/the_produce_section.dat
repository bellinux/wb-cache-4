50|$|On June 2011, a major {{renovation}} {{occurred at the}} Walmart location, with the intention to convert it into a Supercentre; the remodelling process was completed around late 2011. Aisles such as entertainment and cosmetics were moved {{in order to make}} way for <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> <b>section.</b> Two elevators were also added.|$|E
50|$|Four {{structural}} bays of the roof, measuring 27 by 23 meters (87 by 75 feet), {{collapsed into}} <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> <b>section.</b> One store employee was trapped under the debris and was removed by first responders using forklifts; {{he suffered a}} crushed pelvis. Several people were blown off their feet by the rushing air from the collapse.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{restrictions}} on imports, mangosteen is {{not readily available}} in certain countries. Although available in Australia, for example, they are still rare in <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> <b>sections</b> of grocery stores in North America. Following export from its natural growing regions in Southeast Asia, the fresh fruit may be available seasonally in some local markets like those of Chinatowns.|$|R

50|$|On August 13, 2010, Omarosa {{confirmed}} {{that she was}} dating actor Michael Clarke Duncan, whom she had met in <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> <b>section</b> of a Whole Foods supermarket. In July 2012, she found Duncan in cardiac arrest and performed CPR. Omarosa was able to resuscitate him. He never fully recovered from the heart attack, and died on September 3, 2012, after having spent two months in the hospital.|$|E
5000|$|Published in December 2008, the Supermarket Survival Guide {{addresses}} grocery-store, food shopping, {{and using}} the format of swapping out one unhealthy product for a better one. It provides label decoders (defining claims like [...] "free range" [...] or [...] "organic") and nutritional values on all the various areas of the supermarket (such as <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> <b>section,</b> meat counter, and cereal aisles). A shopper can use this book to filter through the multiple brand choices, and discern what product—whether it be deli meat or sandwich bread—is the healthiest option.|$|E
50|$|The Station Square collapse, {{also known}} as the Save-On-Foods collapse, was a major {{structural}} failure of a new supermarket and parking facility in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada. On April 23, 1988, within minutes of the grand opening of a new Save-On-Foods store, a 6,400 square foot portion of the roof collapsed sending the rooftop parking deck and 20 automobiles crashing into <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> <b>section</b> below. There were no fatalities and 21 people were treated in hospital. In the years following the collapse, recommendations from a commission of inquiry resulted in significant changes to the practice of architecture and engineering throughout British Columbia.|$|E

50|$|Central Market {{deliberately}} limits {{floor space}} allocated to packaged products, allowing more space for fresh produce, meat and seafood, bulk products, and chef-prepared items. <b>The</b> <b>produce</b> <b>section</b> stocks {{items such as}} crab-apples, Meyer lemons, sweet limes, and pink lemons {{that are hard to}} find at other stores. The limited space for packaged products is devoted primarily to items that cannot be found at other supermarkets. Other aisles follow the same pattern with an emphasis on local, imported, organic, and gourmet brands rather than standard supermarket products. Central Market also offers a wide variety of sushi which is made in house by sushi chefs. The company that provides the sushi is called Sushi Avenue Inc. based out of Eagan,Mn.|$|E
50|$|Collier {{was born}} and raised in Shreveport, Louisiana. He played {{football}} at Northwood High School, where he graduated in 2001. Poor grades prevented him from attending college, and he spent the next two years working in <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> <b>section</b> of a local Wal-Mart. Eventually, he decided to give football and college another try, and enrolled at Tyler Junior College in Texas. There he soon improved both his grades and his physical fitness, and made the Tyler football team's starting lineup. In 2004, he transferred to Valdosta State University in Georgia, where he played for the Valdosta State Blazers football team. The team won the 2004 NCAA Division II National Football Championship, and Collier received All-America honors in 2005, his senior year.|$|E
5000|$|... "Gonna Get Over You" [...] {{is a song}} {{written and}} {{recorded}} by American singer Sara Bareilles. It was released as {{the third and final}} single from her second studio album Kaleidoscope Heart (2010). On September 20, a new version featuring Ryan Tedder was released exclusively on iTunes. Lyrically, the song speaks about getting over an ex-lover and is a [...] "doo-wop pop song." [...] It received a positive reception from most music critics, who noted it as one of the album's highlights and a [...] "harmony post-breakup track." [...] A music video was released on September 20 and is directed by actor Jonah Hill. Mainly, the video consists of a heavily eye-lined, leather jacket-wearing Bareilles as she grooves her way down the supermarket aisle. Later, she's joined by a group of identical leather jacket-wearing pals who dance with her as she grazes <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E

50|$|The stratigraphic {{section at}} Boscán Field {{consists}} of sands and shales of Oligocene and Eocene ages deposited in a tidally-influenced fluvial-deltaic depositional setting. The Oligocene sediments are commonly non-oil bearing and are dominantly shaley. The Eocene sands {{are part of}} the Misoa Formation and form <b>the</b> <b>producing</b> reservoir <b>section</b> locally known as the Boscán Formation.|$|R
5000|$|Leaseback {{agreements}} {{were bought}} {{out and the}} company began closing unprofitable stores. Old warehouse operations were shut down and a new distribution centre built. The company also initiated a broad marketing strategy that saw a prototype store renovated and remodelled in new colours and a new Loblaws logo. Toronto designer Don Watt introduced new wood panelling, big moveable display bins, and huge photos of fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats. <b>The</b> <b>produce</b> <b>section</b> was doubled in size {{and moved to the}} front of the store. Sales dramatically increased and more stores were remodelled and rebranded. Meanwhile, a new advertising campaign featured Canadian actor William Shatner of Star Trek fame, who told television audiences to [...] "Come on over to Loblaws" [...] and [...] "More than the price is right....but by gosh the price is right." [...] In 1974, W. Galen Weston was appointed Chairman and Managing Director of George Weston Limited, and subsequently company President.|$|E
5000|$|City dwellers {{can also}} produce fresh home grown fruit and {{vegetables}} in pot gardens or miniature indoor greenhouses. Tomatoes, lettuce, spinach, Swiss chard, peas, strawberries, and several types of herbs can all thrive in pots. Jim Merkel says that a person [...] "could sprout seeds. They are tasty, incredibly nutritious, and easy to grow... We grow them in wide mouthed mason jars with a square of nylon window screen screwed under a metal ring". Farmer Matt Moore spoke on this issue: [...] "How does it affect the consumer to know that broccoli takes 105 days to grow a head? ... The supermarket mode is one of plenty — it's always stocked. And that changes our sense of time. How {{long it takes to}} grow food — that's removed in the marketplace. They don't want you to think about {{how long it takes to}} grow, because they want you to buy right now". [...] One way to change this viewpoint is also suggested by Mr. Moore. He placed a video installation in <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> <b>section</b> of a grocery store that documented the length of time it took to grow certain vegetables. [...] This aimed to raise awareness in people of the length of time actually needed for gardens.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{fresh fruits}} and {{vegetables}} have attracted attention as potential alternative agricultural enterprises. <b>The</b> <b>produce</b> <b>section</b> also has grown in importance in the supermarket industry. Yet, there is little known about the produce shelf space allocation process within supermarket chains. This research describes the organization of fresh produce marketing within retail supermarket chains. Implications are derived for market penetration by new produce suppliers, particularly growers of specialty produce items. Results are reported form personal interviews conducted with the person most responsible for produce merchandising within each of 17 supermarket chains operating in the Virginia area.

40|$|The Craft of Design is a {{research}} project initiated and conducted jointly with Anthony Quinn that aims to articulate the intellectual and visual currency of ‘designing through making’. It describes the act of realising an idea in a three dimensional maquette: What Constantin Boym has described as a “disappearing craft”. This is of particular relevance {{in the face of}} the development of CAD CAM technologies. To interrogate our concept within the design world we visited the Milan Furniture Fair 06, where together we conducted an extensive series of interviews with leading designers. These included George Sowden (co-founder of Memphis), Satyendra Pakhale, Renny Ramakers (co-founder of Droog), Shin Azumi, Kuno Prey, Maxim Velkovsky, Constantin Boym, Ana Mir and Emili Padros, all of whom discussed ‘designing through making’. We were subsequently commissioned by Vicky Richardson, editor of Blueprint to write an article based upon the transcriptions of our interviews. Jointly written, the article was published in <b>the</b> <b>Produce</b> <b>section,</b> a new initiative within the magazine, which seeks to interrogate the design process in more depth. To illuminate the importance of this investigative aspect of practice, the article included a number of illustrations contrasting working models with finished products by the chosen designers...|$|E
40|$|Tropical leaf {{vegetables}} are {{grown in the}} tropics and are rich sources of nutrients, particularly minerals, and vitamins (Oomen and Grubben 1978). A number of species and cultivars have been introduced and grown in the continental US on a limited-scale, particularly in the southern region (Lamberts 1993). The US is a major market for tropical and specialty greens {{and most of the}} shipments come from the Caribbean and Latin America. For example, in 1998, total US imports for dasheen leaves (Colocasia esculenta L. Schott, Araceae) was over 90 t. From this total, 70 % came from Jamaica and 30 % from the Dominican Republic (Pearrow 1991). In the same year, the US imported amaranthus (Amaranthus spp. L., Amaranthaceae) at 27 t from the same countries. In 1988, shipments of Oriental, Mexican, tropical, and exotic produce, including specialty leafy greens, accounted for about 5 % of fresh vegetable shipments, whereas in previous years the volumes have been too low to track (Cook 1990; Lamberts 1990, 1993). There are several reasons for the increasing demand of tropical and specialty leafy greens in the US. Growth in ethnic populations contributes to demand for product diversity within <b>the</b> <b>produce</b> <b>section</b> (Cook 1990) and food, previously considered ethnic or regional in nature is increasingly being consumed by a broader portion of the population. This trend will likely continue as the ethnic population continues to grow and more Americans become familiar with and develop the taste for the new crops. This research study is undertaken with the following objectives: (1) collect and describe growth characteristics of minor tropical {{leaf vegetables}}; and (2) evaluate yield performance and commercial potentials in the Virgin Islands and the Caribbean.
