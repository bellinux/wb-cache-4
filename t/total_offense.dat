40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to verify the {{hypothesis}} that enhancing social welfare provisions, particularly livelihood subsidies, would have a preventative effect against elderly crime. This article statistically examines the relationship between the rate of crime committed by the elderly and the operation of the social welfare system, mainly in the form of livelihood subsidies. The elderly crime rate was defined as the number of arrests of those aged 65 or older per 100, 000 inhabitants aged 65 or older in each prefecture. The types of crime used as dependent variables in this study were Penal Code <b>offenses</b> (<b>total),</b> felonious <b>offenses,</b> violent offenses, larceny offenses, and other Penal Code offenses. The index of the enhancement of social welfare system used as independent variables in this study were Public welfare expenses per inhabitant, the number of welfare offices per 100, 000 inhabitants, the number of welfare officers per 100, 000 inhabitants, and the sufficiency rate of caseworkers in each prefecture. Results from regression analyses show that public welfare expenses per inhabitant is significantly negatively correlated with Penal Code <b>offenses</b> (<b>total),</b> felonious <b>offenses,</b> other Penal Code offenses, and the sufficiency rate of caseworkers is significantly negatively correlated with Penal Code <b>offenses</b> (<b>total),</b> felonious <b>offenses,</b> and other Penal Code offenses. These results corroborate not only preceding statistical studies that show correlation but also the individual example investigation that shows direct causality between the social welfare and the crimes. Therefore, it is thought that these results were valid. The hypothesis of this study was supported from welfare expenses and caseworker’s staffing points of view...|$|R

50|$|Instead, self-reporting crime {{statistics}} {{have been used}} to overcome the criticism that the official arrest statistics are biased. Many studies found little or no differences in self-reported offending among juveniles of different racial and ethnic group, with some scholars suggesting that institutionalized racism within the criminal justice system is the cause for the disproportionate arrest rates of African Americans. However, Hindelang found that black males were least likely to self-report offenses recorded by the police, with 33 percent of <b>total</b> <b>offenses</b> and 57 percent of serious offenses known to police not being self-reported by African American males, suggesting some caution in concluding that self reported {{crime statistics}} accurately portray the actual rate of crime behavior.|$|R

40|$|Do general amnesty {{programs}} lead to {{reductions in}} the crime rate among immigrants? We answer this question by exploiting both cross-sectional and time variation {{in the number of}} immigrants legalized generated by the enactment of repeated amnesty programs between 1990 and 2005 in Italy. We address the potential endogeneity of the "legalization treatment" by instrumenting the actual number of legalized immigrants with alternative predicted measures based on past amnesty applications patterns and residential choices of documented and undocumented immigrants. We find that, in the year following an amnesty, regions in which a higher share of immigrants obtained legal status experienced a greater decline in non-EU immigrant crime rates, relative to other regions. The effect is statistically significant but relatively small and not persistent. In further results, we fail to find any evidence of substitution in the criminal market from other population groups - namely, EU immigrants and Italian citizens - and we observe a small and not persistent reduction in <b>total</b> <b>offenses...</b>|$|R
