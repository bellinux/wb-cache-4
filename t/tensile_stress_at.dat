50|$|Ultimate tensile {{strength}} is the <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> which the bolt fails. Tensile yield strength is the stress {{at which the}} bolt will yield in tension across the entire section of the bolt and receive a permanent set (an elongation from which it will not recover when the force is removed) of 0.2% offset strain. Proof strength is the usable strength of the fastener. Tension testing of a bolt up to the proof load should not cause permanent set of the bolt and should be conducted on actual fasteners rather than calculated. If a bolt is tensioned beyond the proof load, it may behave in plastic manner due to yielding in the threads and the tension preload may be lost due to the permanent plastic deformations. When elongating a fastener prior to reaching the yield point, the fastener {{is said to be}} operating in the elastic region; whereas elongation beyond the yield point is referred to as operating in the plastic region of the bolt material. If a bolt is loaded in tension beyond its proof strength, the yielding at the net root section of the bolt will continue until the entire section is begins to yield and it has exceeded its yield strength. If tension increases, the bolt fractures at its ultimate strength.|$|E

50|$|The broken rod was {{replaced}} with a new rod and loading conditions were applied. Four strain gauges were attached {{at a distance of}} 533 mm from the lower end, located 90 degrees apart around the circumference of the rod. Readings were taken during manual release and application of the brake and during emergency application of brake. The results showed that in addition to the expected direct <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>at</b> gauge positions there were substantial stresses due to bending when the brake was operated. The magnitude of stresses varied {{to such an extent that}} for the one farthest from the drum there was a change from tension to compression as the brake was released. The rod was not designed for such alternating bending loads. The rod was designed with a factor of safety 6.1 for <b>tensile</b> <b>stress.</b> But when alternative bending stress are induced, failure was inevitable.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) {{crack propagation}} {{is a hot}} issue in rock mechanics. To properly simulate 3 D crack propagation, a modified maximum tangential tensile stress criterion is proposed. In this modified criterion, it is supposed that cracks propagate only at crack front in the principal normal plane. The tangential <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> crack front in the principal normal plane in local coordinates is employed to determine crack propagation, which is calculated through coordinate transformation from global to local coordinates. New cracks will propagate when the maximum tangential <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> crack front in the principal normal plane reaches the tensile strength of rock-like materials. Compared with the previous crack propagation criteria, the modified crack propagation criterion is helpful in calculating 3 D crack stress intensity factor, and can overcome the limitations of propagation step determined by individual experiences in previous studies. Finally, the 3 D crack propagation process is traced by element-free Galerkin method. The numerical results agree well with the experimental ones for a frozen resin sample with prefabricated 3 D cracks...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} tensile stress {{distribution}} within a solid circular cylinder of diameter D and length IL subjected to double diametral indenture or diametral point load strength test (PLST).

Numerical results show that the <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> the center of the cylinders, in general, decreases with Poisson's ratio v and increases with 2 L/D for 2 L/D 1. This prediction agrees exactly with the shape effect observed experimentally for the PLST for marbles, granite, and tuff found in Hong Kong and with previous published results for other rocks. The magnitude of <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> <b>at</b> the center is about three times the prediction obtained by using Wijk's formula, but seems more comparable with experimental results.

25|$|Hydration and {{hardening}} {{of concrete}} {{during the first}} three days is critical. Abnormally fast drying and shrinkage due to factors such as evaporation from wind during placement may lead to increased <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>at</b> a time when it has not yet gained sufficient strength, resulting in greater shrinkage cracking. The early strength of the concrete can be increased if it is kept damp during the curing process. Minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking. High-early-strength concrete is designed to hydrate faster, often by increased use of cement that increases shrinkage and cracking. The strength of concrete changes (increases) for up to three years. It depends on cross-section dimension of elements and conditions of structure exploitation. Addition of short-cut polymer fibers can improve (reduce) shrinkage-induced stresses during curing and increase early and ultimate compression strength.|$|R
