5|$|In the meantime, Marthandan {{arrives at}} Ratnapuri. Vijayavarman asks {{him to stay}} in an {{isolated}} palace on the outskirts and tells him that he should not meet his wife Manohari until the coronation, as the current moment is inauspicious. On entering a hotel in Ratnapuri, Veerangan and Sagayam beat up a gang of rowdies. Hired by Vijayavarman, they mistake Veerangan for Marthandan. Veerangan is chased by palace guards and ends up in Marthandan's room. Marthandan and Veerangan meet face to face. Veerangan tells him of <b>the</b> <b>pathetic</b> state the people of Ratnapuri, and Marthandan agrees to set everything right as soon as he takes charge. On the eve of the coronation, Vijayavarman arranges for Marthandan to be poisoned. He carries out his plan with the help of Karmegam, a royal advisor. Marthandan swoons after drinking a few sips of the poisoned beverage, but is soon saved by Veerangan and Ratnapuri's commander-in-chief. However, Marthandan is still unconscious and incapacitated. The commander-in-chief, and one of the ministers, persuade Veerangan to take Marthandan's place to ensure that the coronation takes place as scheduled. A reluctant Veerangan agrees {{to do so in the}} interests of the state, and arrives just in time for the coronation. It takes place smoothly and Veerangan, as Marthandan, becomes Ratnapuri's new king. Vijayavarman and Pingalan are taken aback and send men to investigate. They find the unconscious Marthandan and kidnap him.|$|E

25|$|Anne’s {{portrayal}} of Arthur Huntigdon deflates Byronic cult – while witty, adventurous and handsome, {{he is not}} endowed with intellectual gifts, nor even vitality, famously exhibited by Heathcliff, and has nothing of the fundamental goodness that finally redeemed Rochester. All Huntingdon's vices come from his being spoilt as a child. Analyzing the lack of sense and reason amongst males as the consequence of value-system based on the worship of machismo, Anne depicts <b>the</b> <b>pathetic</b> end of her main hero, brought on by his drinking habits. Totally dependent on his estranged wife in his final illness, Arthur Huntingdon ultimately loses all his personality.|$|E

25|$|In poetry, {{the early}} 18th century was {{an age of}} satire and public verse, and in prose, it was an age of the {{developing}} novel. In drama, by contrast, it was an age in transition between the highly witty and sexually playful Restoration comedy, <b>the</b> <b>pathetic</b> she-tragedy of {{the turn of the}} 18th century, and any later plots of middle-class anxiety. The Augustan stage retreated from the Restoration's focus on cuckoldry, marriage for fortune, and a life of leisure. Instead, Augustan drama reflected questions the mercantile class had about itself and {{what it meant to be}} gentry: what it meant to be a good merchant, how to achieve wealth with morality, and the proper role of those who serve.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing Aparichithudu, the Telugu {{version of}} the film, The Hindu {{said that it was}} watchable. Regarding the Hindi {{version of the}} film, Raja Sen of Rediff.com derided <b>the</b> <b>pathetic</b> dubbing though saying that it was {{refreshing}} and watchable, despite boasting of enough masala to make the viewers sneeze. He concluded his review by saying, [...] "Overall, Aparichit is a slickly made, well-paced actioner that works quite well, despite the dub. The film is engaging and crisply scripted, and the action is never too excessive, lightened by jokes and general tomfoolery that never offensively interrupts the actual plot." ...|$|E
500|$|In Australia, [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] was {{broadcast}} on January 27, 2012. It {{was the first}} new episode since [...] "Mash Off" [...] had aired on November 16, 2012, and was in a new Friday evening time slot {{as opposed to the}} previously scheduled Wednesday broadcasts. It was watched by 575,000 viewers, down over 15% from the previous new episode, which was watched by 683,000 viewers. David Dale of the Sydney Morning Herald was scathing in his opinion of the show's rescheduling: [...] "Channel Ten must be insane to waste a new season of Glee on a night when the target audience are all out trying to get alcohol with fake IDs.

500|$|It is {{not known}} {{precisely}} why Coates failed to purchase the painting; however, {{it seems likely that}} Coates felt the work was too controversial to acquire. Coates, as Head of Instruction at Eakins' academy, would have been familiar with the subject matter of Eakins' works, and thus it seems unlikely that the nudity in the painting would have surprised or shocked him. Rather, it seems certain that Coates would have recognized the majority of men in the painting, as all but one were students of Eakins at the academy. He was undoubtedly familiar with the site depicted in the painting too, as it was only a half a mile (800 m) from Haverford College, where Coates studied as an undergraduate. The depiction of a professor and his students together in the nude would have been a sensitive subject for the academy's directors, who had forbidden Eakins from using Academy students as models, as modeling was considered indecent. Coates chose to exchange The Swimming Hole for the [...] "less controversial genre scene" [...] of Eakins' <b>The</b> <b>Pathetic</b> Song—today housed in the Corcoran Gallery of Art— and paid Eakins the $800 he had offered for the original commission.|$|E
500|$|Grossmith {{was a hit}} as the tradesmanlike John Wellington Wells, {{the title}} role in The Sorcerer, and became a regular member of Richard D'Oyly Carte's company. [...] He created all nine of the lead comic {{baritone}} roles in Gilbert and Sullivan's famous Savoy Operas in London from 1877 to 1889, including the pompous First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Joseph Porter, in H.M.S. Pinafore (1878); Major-General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance, who is an expert at everything except [...] "military knowledge" [...] (1880); the aesthetic poet, Reginald Bunthorne in Patience (1881); the love-lonely Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe (1882); the sarcastic cripple, King Gama, in Princess Ida (1884); Ko-Ko the cheap tailor, elevated to the post of Lord High Executioner, in The Mikado (1885); the accursed Robin Oakapple in Ruddigore (1887); and <b>the</b> <b>pathetic</b> jester, Jack Point, in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888). On 29 January 1887, {{one week after the}} opening night of Ruddigore, Grossmith fell dangerously ill. However, by 13 February, his physicians pronounced him convalescent, and he resumed the role of Robin by 18 February. During Grossmith's absence, his understudy Henry Lytton, who would later become the principal comedian of the company, had the opportunity to perform the role in Grossmith's place.|$|E
500|$|Pauline and Arthur were {{generally}} {{seen as the}} most stable couple in the show, so Arthur's affair with Christine Hewitt (Lizzie Power) {{came as a shock}} to viewers. The storyline was long-running, beginning early in 1992 with the introduction of lonely divorcee Christine, who employs Arthur to tend to her garden. A romance between Arthur and Christine steadily develops throughout the year, facilitated by Pauline's lengthy absence—she is called abroad to tend to her crippled brother Kenny in early June, and she does not return until late September—in reality, Wendy Richard had to be temporarily written out of EastEnders to allow her to act in Grace and Favour. The build-up to the affair contains many twists and turns, starting with Arthur's rebuff of Christine's advances, then a confrontation between Pauline and Christine, which convinces Pauline of Arthur's innocence and leaves her feeling [...] "strangely sorry for <b>the</b> <b>pathetic,</b> lonely figure, who obviously drank too much". The episode in which Arthur finally gives into temptation and sleeps with Christine aired on Christmas Eve 1992; it was labelled [...] "The Bonk of the Year" [...] by the British press, and was watched by 24.3million viewers. In 2005, it was reported as the eleventh most highly viewed UK television programme of all time.|$|E

500|$|Willis {{arbitrarily}} {{refused to}} print {{the work of}} his sister Sara Willis ("Fanny Fern") after 1854, though she previously had contributed anonymous book reviews to the Home Journal. She had recently been widowed, became destitute, and was publicly denounced by her abusive second husband. Criticizing what he perceived as her restlessness, Willis once made her the subject of his poem [...] "To My Wild Sis". [...] As Fanny Fern, she had published Fern Leaves, which sold over 100,000 copies the year before. Willis, however, did not encourage his sister's writings. [...] "You overstrain <b>the</b> <b>pathetic,</b> and your humor runs into dreadful vulgarity sometimes... I am sorry that any editor knows that a sister of mine wrote some of these which you sent me", he wrote. In 1854 she published Ruth Hall, a Domestic Tale of the Present Time, a barely concealed semi-autobiographical account of her own difficulties in the literary world. Nathaniel Willis was represented as [...] "Hyacinth Ellet", an effeminate, self-serving editor who schemes to ruin his sister's prospects as a writer. Willis did not publicly protest but in private he asserted that, despite his fictitious equivalent, he had done his best to support his sister during her difficult times, especially after the death of her first husband.|$|E
500|$|Laughton was {{so pleased}} with O'Hara's {{performance}} in Jamaica Inn {{that she was}} cast opposite him in The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939) for RKO in Hollywood. She boarded the RMS Queen Mary with him and her mother to New York, and then traveled by train to Hollywood. O'Hara's agent Lew Wasserman arranged for a pay increase from $80 a week to $700 a week. As {{the new face of}} RKO she garnered much attention from the Hollywood press and society before the film was even released, something which made her uncomfortable as she felt that she was being viewed as a [...] "novelty" [...] and [...] "people were making a fuss over me because of something I hadn't yet done, something they just thought I might do". O'Hara portrayed Esmeralda, a gypsy dancer who is imprisoned and later sentenced to death by the Parisian authorities. Director William Dieterle initially showed concern that O'Hara was too tall and disliked her wavy hair, asking for her to step under a shower to straighten it out. Filming commenced in the San Fernando Valley, {{at a time when the}} city was experiencing its hottest summer in its history. O'Hara described it as a [...] "physically demanding shoot", due to the heavy makeup and costume requirements, and recalls that she gasped at Laughton in makeup as Quasimodo, remarking, [...] "Good God, Charles. Is that really you?". O'Hara insisted on doing her own stunts from the outset, and for the scene in which the hangman places a noose around her neck, no safety nets were used. The film was a commercial success, taking $3 million at the box office. O'Hara was generally praised for her performance though some critics thought that Laughton stole the show. One critic thought that was the strength of the film, writing: [...] "The contrast between Laughton as <b>the</b> <b>pathetic</b> hunchback and O'Hara as the fresh-faced, tenderly solicitous gypsy girl is Hollywood teaming at its most inspired".|$|E

2500|$|Edwin Whipple in 1867 also {{commented on}} the {{sentiment}} and pathos of Dickens's characters, stating, [...] "But the poetical, the humorous, the tragic, or <b>the</b> <b>pathetic</b> element is never absent in Dickens's characterization, to make his delineations captivating to the heart and imagination, and give the reader a sense of having escaped from whatever in the actual world is dull and wearisome." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in April 1815 was John Taylor Coleridge's {{review for}} the British Critic, which read, [...] "This {{is the first}} time that we have had an {{opportunity}} of paying Mr. Southey the attention which he deserves; and we avail ourselves of it gladly [...] Mr. Southey is eminently a moral writer; to the high purpose implied in this title, the melody of his numbers, the clear rapidity of his style, <b>the</b> <b>pathetic</b> power which he exercises over our feelings, and the interesting manner of telling his story, whether in verse or prose, are all merely contributive." [...] The review concluded: [...] "here is plenty of sword and dagger, war-horse and chariot, a bugle or two, some little love, several beauties, and even a marriage in prospectu, with all the other ingredients of a 'charming poem.' If any one doat so desperately on 'love and glory,' that this does not content him, we are very sorry, but we cannot honestly recommend Don Roderick to his attention." ...|$|E
2500|$|Capp {{had often}} parodied {{corporate}} greed—pork tycoon J. Roaringham Fatback had figured prominently in wiping out the Shmoos. But in 1952, when General Motors president Charles E. Wilson, {{nominated for a}} cabinet post, told Congress [...] "...what {{was good for the}} country was good for General Motors and vice versa," [...] he inspired one of Capp's greatest satires—the introduction of General Bullmoose, the robust, ruthless, and ageless business tycoon. The blustering Bullmoose, who seemed to own and control nearly everything, justified his far-reaching and mercenary excesses by saying [...] "What's good for General Bullmoose is good for everybody!" [...] Bullmoose's corrupt interests were often pitted against those of <b>the</b> <b>pathetic</b> Lower Slobbovians in a classic mismatch of [...] "haves" [...] versus [...] "have-nots". This character, along with the Shmoos, helped cement Capp's favor with the Left, and would increase their outrage a decade later when Capp, a former Franklin D. Roosevelt liberal, switched targets. Nonetheless, General Bullmoose continued to appear, undaunted and unredeemed, during the strip's final right-wing phase and into the 1970s.|$|E

2500|$|Dare {{was almost}} universally {{critically}} acclaimed in the UK, and featured {{strongly in the}} year end polls for 1981. In Melody Maker Steve Sutherland celebrated the fact the album would irritate the guitar-rock traditionalists, saying, [...] "All let's-pretend-pompous it's cornily consistent, cultured, crude, elegant, cheap... anything {{you want it to}} be. Me? I think it's a masterpiece. Sure to upset some, sell to millions more and so it should the way it tramps all over rock traditions. A trite sound, a retarded glam image and a mock respect. All the appeal in the world... Dare should show up <b>the</b> <b>pathetic</b> farce of pop mythology once and for all." [...] Smash Hits critic David Hepworth called it [...] "chock-full of precise, memorable melodies delivered with style and humour". Noted music critic Paul Morley wrote in the NME, [...] "Dare is the second intoxicating intervention to be produced out of the great split , and already it's the first Human League greatest hits collection... Much more than ABBA or whoever you like, The Human League signify that deliciously serious, sincerely disposable MOR music can possess style, quality and sophistication... I think that Dare is one of the GREAT popular music LPs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nilsen {{was adamant}} he was {{uncertain}} {{as to why}} he had killed, simply saying [...] "I'm hoping you will tell me that" [...] when asked his motive for the murders. He was adamant the decision to kill was not made until moments before the actual act of murder. Most victims had been killed by strangulation, although on several occasions, he had drowned the victims once they had been strangled into unconsciousness. Once the victim had been killed, he would typically bathe the victim's body, shave any hair from the torso to conform the body to his physical ideal, then apply makeup to any obvious blemishes upon the skin. The body would usually be dressed in socks and underpants, before Nilsen would drape the victims' arms around him as he talked to the corpse. With most victims, Nilsen would masturbate as he stood alongside or knelt above the body, and although Nilsen confessed to having occasionally engaged in intercrural sex with his victims' bodies, he repeatedly stressed to investigators he had never penetrated his victims — harking that his victims were [...] "too perfect and beautiful for <b>the</b> <b>pathetic</b> ritual of commonplace sex".|$|E
2500|$|Later in {{the same}} book, an essay from Shakespeare critic Garret A. Sullivan Jr. {{describes}} {{the relationship between the}} speaker and the young man which is seen in sonnet four, saying [...] "The young man of the procreation sonnets, then, is the object of admonition; the poet (speaker) urgently seeks to make him change his ways, and, as we shall see does so in the intertwined names of beauty and memory and in the face of oblivion". Sonnet Four follows these very themes with the speaker praising his friend, the young man, for his beauty, he moves on to say that his friend not having children would be inexcusable, when he says [...] "Then how when nature calls thee to be gone: What acceptable audit canst though leave?" [...] (lines 11–12) Here the speaker is using the unpredictability of nature to try to convince his friend to hurry up and have children. He also tries to appeal to his friend's emotions by saying, [...] "For having traffic with thyself alone, / Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive" [...] (lines 9-10). The speaker is saying that is wrong and deceives the friend's own self if he decides to remain single and childless. Line 11 also contains a sexually suggestive play on words when the speaker says [...] "having traffic with thyself alone". The idea of being alone is used by the speaker as being <b>the</b> <b>pathetic</b> alternative to marrying and having a family.|$|E
