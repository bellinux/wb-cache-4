5|$|Some of the temple's {{supplies}} {{came from}} direct donations by the king. In the New Kingdom, when Egypt was an imperial power, these donations often {{came out of}} the spoils of the king's military campaigns or the tribute given by his client states. The king might also levy various taxes that went directly to support a temple. Other revenue came from private individuals, who offered land, slaves, or goods to temples in exchange for a supply of offerings and priestly services <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> <b>their</b> spirits in the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|The {{churches have}} also engaged in {{reconciliation}} initiatives {{such as the}} Returning to Spirit: Residential School Healing and Reconciliation Program, a workshop that aims to unite Indigenous and non-Indigenous people through discussing the legacy of residential schools and fostering an environment for them to communicate and develop mutual understanding. In 2014, the federal government ceased to contribute funds to Indigenous health {{organizations such as the}} AHF and the National Aboriginal Health Organization. Since then, more pressure has been placed on churches <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> <b>their</b> active participation in these healing efforts.|$|E
5|$|In works where elves are {{the main}} characters, such as The Silmarillion or Wendy and Richard Pini’s comic book series Elfquest, elves exhibit a similar range of {{behaviour}} to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. However, where narratives are more human-centered, as in The Lord of the Rings, elves tend <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> <b>their</b> role as powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders. Despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games, scholars have found that elves in these works {{continue to have a}} subtle role in shaping the real-life identities of their audiences. For example, elves can function to encode real-world racial others in video games, or to influence gender-norms through literature.|$|E

5|$|The growing {{consensus}} about the endothermy of dinosaurs (see dinosaur physiology) helps {{to understand their}} full extinction in contrast with their close relatives, the crocodilians. Ectothermic ("cold-blooded") crocodiles have very limited needs for food (they can survive several months without eating) while endothermic ("warm-blooded") animals of similar size need much more food <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> <b>their</b> faster metabolism. Thus, under the circumstances of food chain disruption previously mentioned, non-avian dinosaurs died, while some crocodiles survived. In this context, the survival of other endothermic animals, such as some birds and mammals, could be due, among other reasons, to their smaller needs for food, related to their small size at the extinction epoch.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Haruto {{has been}} dating Asuka Mishima. When he reunites with Yuzuki, the two realize they still love each other. Haruto ends his {{relationship}} with Asuka {{in order to be}} with Yuzuki which causes their friends to ostracize them. When Yuzuki's father objects to their relationship and attempts to relocate her, she runs away from home to live with Haruto; the two eventually earn her father's approval. After reconciling with their friends and graduating from university, Haruto takes a job that relocates him to Kōchi.

The two are married shortly after.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} {{different}} circumstances from which they came, and in which they played, the rhythm and blues produced by British artists was very different in tone from that created by African Americans, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. They have been criticised for exploiting the massive catalogue of African American music, {{but it has also}} been noted that they both popularised that music, bringing it to British, world and in some cases American audiences, and helping to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm and blues artists. In order <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> <b>their</b> careers most British R artists soon moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music. Many from the 60s helped pioneer psychedelic, and eventually progressive, hard rock and heavy metal, mixing in elements of world, folk and classical music. Others from the 1970s and 1980s, helped shape new wave and post-punk music and had a major impact on later genres, including Britpop. As a result, British rhythm and blues has been a major component of the sound of rock music.|$|E

30|$|The {{alternative}} {{model for}} the development of vitamin B 12 deficiency contains only three stages: Normal; Depletion; Metabolic Deficiency (Fig.  5). The Normal stage is defined as the condition in which the intake, and the internal processing, for an individual provides sufficient vitamin B 12 <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> all of <b>their</b> metabolic requirements and maintain their body store of vitamin B 12. The Depletion stage, marked by the commencement of a long-term fall in serum total vitamin B 12 concentration, is defined as the condition in which the intake, or the internal processing, for an individual does not provide sufficient vitamin B 12 <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> all of <b>their</b> metabolic requirements, which are then maintained by depleting their body store of vitamin B 12. The Metabolic Deficiency stage, marked by the commencement of a fall in the HoloTC concentration and an increase in either MMA or tHcy or both metabolites, is defined as the condition in which the depleted body store of vitamin B 12, or the internal processing, for an individual is insufficient <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> all of <b>their</b> metabolic requirements.|$|R
5|$|Each race {{relies on}} two {{resources}} <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> <b>their</b> game economies {{and to build}} their forces: minerals and vespene gas. Minerals are needed for all units and structures, and are obtained by using a worker unit to harvest the resource directly from mineral nodes scattered around the battlefield. Players require vespene gas to construct advanced units and buildings, and acquire it by constructing a gas extraction building {{on top of a}} geyser and using worker units to extract the gas from it. In addition, players need to regulate the supplies for their forces to ensure that they can construct the number of units they need. Although the nature of the supply differs between the races—Terrans use physical supplies held in depots, Protoss use psionic energy channeled from their homeworld via pylons, and Zerg are regulated by the number of controlling overlord units present—the supply mechanic essentially works {{in exactly the same way}} for each race (just with differing impacts on gameplay), allowing players to create new units when there are sufficient resources to sustain them.|$|E
5|$|The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) and its {{variants}} {{were the}} highest award in the military of the Third Reich. During or shortly after World War II, 457 servicemen of the Waffen-SS, including volunteers and conscripts from Belgium, Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, Latvia, Netherlands and Norway, received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Of these, 411 presentations were formally made and evidence of the award {{is available in the}} German Federal Archives. One recipient, Hermann Fegelein, was court-martialed and executed on 29 April 1945. According to German law he was deprived of rank and all awards previously. Fegelein must therefore be considered a de facto but not de jure recipient. A further 46 Knight's Cross, 8 Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and 4 Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords recipients are either lacking the evidence <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> <b>their</b> listings or received the award under questionable legal terms. However, all of them were accepted by the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (Ordensgemeinschaft der Ritterkreuzträger des Eisernen Kreuzes e.V.) as legitimate recipients.|$|E
5|$|The {{prolonged}} conflict exhausted {{the economy}} of the Republic, which relied on the lucrative trade with the Ottoman Empire. By the 1660s, despite increased aid from other Christian nations, war-weariness had set in. The Ottomans on the other hand, having managed <b>to</b> <b>sustain</b> <b>their</b> forces on Crete and reinvigorated under the capable leadership of the Köprülü family, sent a final great expedition in 1666 under the direct supervision of the Grand Vizier. This began the final and bloodiest stage of the Siege of Candia, which lasted for more than two years. It ended with the negotiated surrender of the fortress, sealing the fate of the island and ending the war in an Ottoman victory. In the final peace treaty, Venice retained a few isolated island fortresses off Crete, and made some territorial gains in Dalmatia. The Venetian desire for a revanche would lead, barely 15 years later, to a renewed war, from which Venice would emerge victorious. Crete however was lost to the Serenissima. It would remain under Ottoman control until 1897, when it became an autonomous state; it was finally united with Greece in 1913.|$|E

40|$|Coinciding with a {{proposal}} for a National Innovation Ecosystem (NIES) by the US Council on Competitiveness, Japan's Industrial Structure Council proposed a major shift from a technology policy to an innovation policy based on the ecosystem concept. While Japan and the US achieved success through mutual inspiration in the 1980 s and 1990 s, both countries need a new approach <b>to</b> <b>sustaining</b> <b>their</b> national innovation, {{especially in light of the}} new paradigm for a post-information society, which began in the early 2000 s. Realizing this need led both countries to reexamine the broader applications of the ecosystem discipline to technology policy systems. This paper analyzes the parallel paths of technology policy in Japan and the US over the last three decades. We found that the development cycle in both countries is governed by four ecosystem principles: (1) sustainable development through substitution, (2) self-propagation through co-evolution, (3) organizational inertia and inspired learning from competitors, and (4) heterogeneous synergy...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{transcription}} factor Bcl 6 {{is essential for}} the development of germinal center (GC) B cells and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells. However, little is known about in vivo dynamics of Bcl 6 protein expression during and after development of these cells. By using a Bcl 6 reporter mouse strain, we found that antigen-engaged B cells upregulated Bcl 6 before clustering in GCs. Two-photon microscopic analysis indicated that Bcl 6 upregulation in pre-GC B cells contributed <b>to</b> <b>sustaining</b> <b>their</b> interactions with helper T cells and was required for their entry to GC clusters. Our data also suggested that Tfh cells gradually downmodulated Bcl 6 protein over weeks after development. The Bcl 6 -low Tfh cells rapidly terminated proliferation and upregulated IL- 7 receptor. These results clarify the role of Bcl 6 in pre-GC B cell dynamics and highlight the modulation of Bcl 6 expression in Tfh cells that persist in the late phase of the antibody response...|$|R
