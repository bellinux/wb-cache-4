5|$|However, {{some have}} {{suggested}} that the Moon nonetheless deserves to be called a planet. In 1975, Isaac Asimov noted that the timing of the Moon's orbit is in <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> the Earth's own orbit around the Sun—looking down on the ecliptic, the Moon never actually loops back on itself, and in essence it orbits the Sun in its own right.|$|E

5|$|One {{class of}} honest signal is the aposematic warning signal, {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time as Ferdinand, Tac HQ ran Otterington. This {{deception}} built a threat against Rimini in the east of Italy, in support of Alexander's proposed assault on the centre of the Gothic Line. It developed a pincer movement, in <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> Ferdinand's threat to the west. However, once Otterington had gotten underway, with a major buildup of dummy armour, Alexander changed his plans and decided to push against Rimini. Clarke hastily implemented Ulster, a double bluff in which Otterington was revealed as a sham in the hope it would distract attention from that sector.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> the fast-moving Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|Building on {{the rushing}} success of its {{previous}} drive, Virginia Tech used fullback Josh Oglesby in <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> Williams, who also figured {{prominently in the}} team's second possession of the half. The two men combined for 19 yards on the first three plays of the drive, then Williams exited the game because of an injury. After play resumed, Taylor gained 10 yards on a rushing play and completed a 23-yard pass before Oglesby carried the ball again. When the third quarter ended, Virginia Tech faced second down at the Tennessee 30-yard line, still leading 24-14.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, in <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> {{his work}} at All Souls, Henson acted as tutor to Lyle Rathbone, son of the philanthropic {{businessman}} William Rathbone. The family lived in Birkenhead, where for six months Henson stayed with them. He had ample leisure time, much of which he spent in visiting local churches and nonconformist chapels. This process left him struggling with doctrinal questions, but sure of a religious vocation. The day after his return to Oxford in October 1885 he went into St Mary's, Iffley, and {{with his hand on}} the altar vowed to dedicate himself to God and the Church.|$|E

5|$|In a {{land where}} {{approximately}} 90% of the original island forest has been destroyed, ruffed lemurs cling to {{only a small fraction}} of their original range. Completely dependent upon large fruiting trees, neither species appears to be flexible with its habitat choice, with selective logging resulting in significantly lower population densities. Although they can survive in very disturbed habitats with lower population densities, they are still especially vulnerable to habitat disturbance. Decreased genetic diversity, in <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> hunting, natural disasters, predation, and disease, can easily wipe out small populations.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> larger Serb and Czech {{national}} units, Romanian prisoners on the Trans-Siberian Railway {{were involved}} in creating new armed formations. Their original goal was to show to the Entente that Romanians were still eager {{to fight against the}} Central Powers, but the Romanians also defended the line in skirmishes with the Bolshevik or anarchist cells. They resisted especially when the Bolshevik Russian government asked them to surrender all weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} with ESRO resulted in TSS providing telemetry for ESRO-IA, ESRO-IB, ESRO-2B, HEOS-1, HEOS-2, TD-1A and ESRO-4, {{all of which}} had low-Earth orbits. The two telemetry stations used {{a large portion of}} the Norwegian space budget, but became platforms which allowed for development of technology. Tromsø Satellite Station worked well in <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> Andøya Rocket Range and became an international center for study of the auroral zone. The University of Tromsø was established in 1968 and started teaching in 1972. The same year, it took over the geophysical observatory and cosmic geophysics became one of the university's fields of excellence.|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of aposematism {{is to prevent}} attack, by warning potential predators that the prey animal has defences such as being unpalatable or poisonous. The easily detected warning is a primary defence mechanism, and the non-visible defences are secondary. Aposematic signals are primarily visual, using bright colours and high-contrast patterns such as stripes. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is.|$|E

The Testament of Dr. Mabuse is a direct sequel to Dr. Mabuse the Gambler and is related to the film M which features the Inspector Lohmann character.|$|E
5|$|Alston played {{high school}} {{football}} at Warren County High School as a quarterback. He later attended college at East Carolina University, where he played for the Pirates from 1999 to 2002. As a freshman, Alston {{was used by the}} Pirates coaching staff in <b>tandem</b> <b>with</b> sophomore teammate David Garrard as a quarterback. As Garrard's usage increased going into his junior and senior years, the Pirates coaching staff tried out Alston at several different positions. After starting the 2001 season as a running back, Alston was converted mid-season to a wide receiver, the position in which he would play out the rest of his college and professional careers. In his final year with the Pirates, Alston led the team with 702 receiving yards on 36 catches, adding six touchdowns.|$|E
