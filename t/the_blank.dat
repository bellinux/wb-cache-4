Two years later, Gilbert and Sullivan would write their first work together. Those two intervening years continued to shape Gilbert's theatrical style.

40|$|Abstract. Machining {{experiments}} of fine-blanking {{with negative}} clearance show that <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force {{is very different}} from ordinary blanking in different blanking stages. Studying on <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force size of fine-blanking with negative clearance in different blanking stages is a very important significance for studying die wear and analyzing the state of material stress-strain. Firstly, numerical simulation and stress state analysis of the fine-blanking with negative clearance are carried out, with DEFORM-metal forming finite element analysis software. Afterward the relationship curve of blanking force and stroke are measured, and <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force with different blanking stages of fine-blanking with negative clearance is analyzed by the simulation and the experiment. The analysis result shows that <b>the</b> simulation <b>blanking</b> force is bigger than the experimental result (error about 15 %), but <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force variation tendency is accordant. while the punch pushes down within 0. 1 mm, <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force changes quickly. The metal sheet will enter into the state of plastic deformation after <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force reaching maximum value. Along with the punch continues to move down, the area of shear zone is decrescent so that <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force inches down, and <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force reaches a certain value in <b>the</b> place of <b>blanking</b> allowance value finally. With punch pushing the metal sheet to enter the plastic state and punch downward the place of the allowance value, the metal sheet sustained <b>the</b> big <b>blanking</b> force all <b>the</b> time as well as the deformation zone material keeps the plastic deformation. The research result provides theoretic reference and the experimental data for the practice application of fine-blanking with negative clearance, and has instructive significance and reference value to mould design...|$|R

Initial {{reactions}} to the gun were mixed: it fulfilled the light machine gun role well when fired from the ground, but was not as effective when fired from the shoulder or hip. It was praised for its extreme durability and massive firepower, though {{a number of areas}} for improvement were highlighted: <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> firing attachment fitted poorly, the bipod was very weak and broke easily, the sling attachment was awkward, and there were many slots and gaps that accumulated dirt.

5|$|During this period, Cooper {{struggled}} with health problems. As {{well as his}} ongoing treatment for ulcers, he suffered a severe shoulder injury during the filming of Blowing Wild when {{he was hit by}} metal fragments from a dynamited oil well. During the filming of Vera Cruz, he reinjured his hip falling from a horse, and was burned when Lancaster fired his rifle too close and the wadding from <b>the</b> <b>blank</b> shell pierced his clothing. In 1955, he appeared in Otto Preminger's biographical war drama The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, about the World War I general who tried to convince government officials of the importance of air power, and was court-martialed after blaming the War Department for a series of air disasters. Some critics felt that Cooper was miscast, and that his dull, tight-lipped performance did not reflect Mitchell's dynamic and caustic personality. In 1956, Cooper was more effective playing a gentle Indiana Quaker in William Wyler's Civil War drama Friendly Persuasion with Dorothy McGuire. Like Sergeant York and High Noon, the film addresses the conflict between religious pacifism and civic duty. For his performance, Cooper received his second Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture Actor. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, was awarded the Palme d'Or at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, and went on to earn $8 million worldwide.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Being an {{important}} <b>blanking</b> parameter, <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> allowance of fine-blanking with negative clearance {{has a direct}} relationship {{with the quality of}} work piece and ejector force. The full process of fine-blanking with negative clearance for ASTM- 1022 in different blanking allowances is simulated through the finite element analysis software DEFORM- 2 D, then the ejector force under different blanking allowances is measured through the experiment of fine-blanking with negative clearance. Based on the analysis of the ejector force, the proportion of burnish band and the work piece fracture, the following conclusions are summarized. <b>The</b> size of <b>blanking</b> allowance is not related with <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force with <b>the</b> sheet entering plastic state and <b>the</b> maximum <b>blanking</b> force, and is only related with the ejector force. When the value of <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> allowance is between 0. 1 mm and 0. 3 mm, the friction force between the punch-die and the sheet affects ejector force, and the ejector force is not related with the mechanical properties of material. When the value of <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> allowance is between 0. 5 mm and 0. 8 mm, with <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> allowance increasing, <b>the</b> ejector force increases rapidly...|$|R
