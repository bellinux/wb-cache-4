500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Paula Vitaris from CFQ {{gave the}} episode a {{negative}} review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She wrote, [...] "Instead of a grand, breath-taking, heart-breaking finale {{that should be}} the climax of Mulder's search for Samantha, the story expires limply with some nonsense about Samantha being of the starlight children." [...] Bobby Bryant and Tracy Burlison of <b>The</b> <b>State</b> <b>named</b> the episode the [...] "Worst Conspiracy" [...] episode. The two noted that because [...] "a tenet of The X-Files was that Mulder's sister, Samantha, had been (a) kidnapped by aliens or (b) kidnapped by government conspirators", {{the fact that she had}} actually been turned into a spirit [...] "insanely offers a supernatural explanation to a science-fiction mystery".|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 1990, Fear of a Black Planet {{appeared}} in the top-10 of several critics' lists of the year's best albums. It was voted the third best record of 1990 in The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll, and the publication's Robert Christgau ranked it number 10 on his own [...] "Dean's list". It was named the second best {{album of the year}} by The Boston Globe, the third best by USA Today, and fifth best by the Los Angeles Timess Robert Hilburn, who wrote that it [...] "dissects aspects of the black experience with an energy and vision that illustrates why rap continues to be the most creative genre in pop". <b>The</b> <b>State</b> <b>named</b> it one of the year's best albums and hailed it as [...] "possibly the boldest and most important rap record ever made. A sonic tour de force". Fear of a Black Planet was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group, presented at the 33rd Grammy Awards in 1991.|$|E

5000|$|The shield {{was next}} {{discussed}} {{during the meeting}} of August 3. Upon motion by Cyrus Avery of Oklahoma, the board officially adopted the shield proposed at the April 21 meeting, having received general support from <b>the</b> <b>states.</b> A debate then ensued regarding the inclusion of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>name.</b> W.O. Hotchkiss of Wisconsin, who {{was in favor of}} removing <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>name,</b> said [...] "We want to emphasize the U.S., not <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> <b>The</b> shield and U.S. symbolized what we are marking." [...] The Joint Board voted 10-9 to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>name.</b>|$|R
50|$|Massachusetts uses {{standard}} Interstate highway shields without <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>name</b> on <b>the</b> shield, {{although a}} small number of very old signs do exist with <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>name.</b> Interstate shields are usually of the extra-large variety, {{with the exception of the}} Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90), which uses standard shields.|$|R
2500|$|The Chandler ranch {{included}} {{property on}} Crooked Creek. [...] In one area along the creek, {{there was a}} stand of large ponderosa pine. [...] These were the first large pine trees that travelers encountered when approaching the area from high desert county {{to the north and}} east. [...] In the mid-1920s, the state highway department offered to buy the pine-covered property along the creek for use as a roadside park. [...] Instead of selling the land, the Chandlers decided to donate the property to the State of Oregon in July 1929. [...] <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>named</b> the park in honor of the Chandlers.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the era of}} <b>the</b> 1948 shield, <b>states</b> often {{modified}} its design. Several <b>states</b> omitted <b>the</b> letters [...] "U S", {{leaving only}} <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>name</b> and route number. Other <b>states</b> moved <b>the</b> letters [...] "U S" [...] into the crown of the shield, along with <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>name,</b> which was often abbreviated.|$|R
50|$|Outside of the {{official}} meeting, {{members of the board}} discussed <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>name</b> issue further. Some members, particularly those from the South, felt {{it would be difficult to}} get local support for the U.S. Route System without it, because <b>the</b> <b>states</b> were required to pay for <b>the</b> signage. Some <b>state</b> legislatures had also legally bound state route numbers to certain corridors, and it was thought that including <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>name</b> might make <b>the</b> legislators more amenable to renumbering them to U.S. Route numbers. The following day, August 4, upon a motion of Robert M. Morton of California, the U.S. shield including <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>name</b> was approved without debate.|$|R
50|$|Shortened {{forms of}} <b>the</b> <b>state's</b> <b>name</b> include CA, Cal., Calif. and US-CA.|$|R

5000|$|West Salem was platted in 1856. It {{was named}} Salem by a Baptist {{minister}} named Elder Card because the word meant [...] "peace" [...] in Arabic and Hebrew.

50|$|However, some governors, such as Rod Blagojevich, {{have chosen}} to not use the governor's homes as their primary residence, instead {{commuting}} either by car or plane to Springfield from their home cities.

50|$|In 1953, Oregon began {{construction}} of a highway bridge {{just east of the}} ferry landings to carry what became Interstate 5. The four-lane, north-south aligned bridge was finished in 1954 and opened to traffic in July, with the ferry ending service at that time. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>named</b> the bridge Boone Bridge in honor of the Boone family. At the time there was a bronze marker in one of the bridge’s piers to commemorate the name, but it was removed when the bridge was later widened.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Terwilliger curves" [...] is {{the name}} given to a 1.7 mi, six-lane section of Interstate 5 (I-5) in Portland, Oregon, {{known as one of}} the most {{dangerous}} stretches of highway in <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> <b>Named</b> for its physical characteristics and proximity to Terwilliger Boulevard, it first opened in 1961 and soon became known for its high accident rate.

Since there was another town in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>named</b> Whitesville, Mr. W. W.
