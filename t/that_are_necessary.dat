5|$|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks is a 1980 {{adventure}} module for the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game {{written by}} Gary Gygax. While Dungeons & Dragons (D) is typically a fantasy game, the adventure includes elements of science fiction, and thus {{belongs to the}} science fantasy genre. It takes place on a downed spaceship; the ship's crew has died of an unspecified disease, but functioning robots and strange creatures still inhabit the ship. The player characters fight monsters and robots, and gather the futuristic weapons and colored access cards <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> for advancing the story.|$|E

25|$|Plant {{nutrition}} is {{the study}} of the chemical elements <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> for plant growth. There are several principles that apply to plant nutrition. Some elements are directly involved in plant metabolism. However, this principle does not account for the so-called beneficial elements, whose presence, while not required, has clear positive effects on plant growth.|$|E

25|$|The early {{genes are}} {{responsible}} for expressing mainly non-structural, regulatory proteins. The goal of these proteins is threefold: to alter the expression of host proteins <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> for DNA synthesis; to activate other virus genes (such as the virus-encoded DNA polymerase); and to avoid premature death of the infected cell by the host-immune defenses (blockage of apoptosis, blockage of interferon activity, and blockage of MHC class I translocation and expression).|$|E
25|$|Human primary oocytes {{are present}} at an {{intermediate}} stage of meiosis, termed prophase I (see Oogenesis). Expression of four key DNA repair genes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> for homologous recombinational repair during meiosis (BRCA1, MRE11, Rad51, and ATM) decline with age in oocytes. This age-related decline in ability to repair DNA double-strand damages {{can account for}} the accumulation of these damages, that then likely contributes to the depletion of the ovarian reserve.|$|E

These four bridges serve not only as an entrance and support, but also house all the electrical wires and other mechanical services <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> in each room.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between habitus and field is two-way. The field exists {{only insofar as}} social agents possess the dispositions and set of perceptual schemata <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> to constitute that field and imbue it with meaning. Concomitantly, by participating in the field, agents incorporate into their habitus the proper know-how {{that will allow them}} to constitute the field. Habitus manifests the structures of the field, and the field mediates between habitus and practice.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{treatment}} techniques for AOS. One technique, called the Linguistic Approach, utilizes {{the rules for}} sounds and sequences. This approach focuses on {{the placement of the}} mouth in forming speech sounds. Another type of treatment is the Motor-Programming Approach, in which the motor movements necessary for speech are practiced. This technique utilizes a great amount of repetition in order to practice the sequences and transitions <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> in between production of sounds.|$|E

By inhibiting microbial growth, copper alloy aquaculture pens avoid the need for costly net changes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> with other materials. The resistance of organism growth on copper alloy nets also provides a cleaner and healthier environment for farmed fish to grow and thrive.|$|E
25|$|Executive {{functions}} (collectively {{referred to}} as executive function and cognitive control) are a set of cognitive processes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> for the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include basic cognitive processes such as attentional control, cognitive inhibition, inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. Higher order executive functions require the simultaneous use of multiple basic executive functions and include planning and fluid intelligence (i.e., reasoning and problem solving).|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of genetic mutations neither assist, change the appearance of, nor bring harm to individuals. Through {{the process of}} genetic drift, these mutated genes are neutrally sorted among populations and survive across generations by chance alone. In contrast to genetic drift, natural selection is not a random process because it acts on traits <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> for survival and reproduction. Natural selection and random genetic drift are constant and dynamic parts of life and over time this has shaped the branching structure in the tree of life.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{pointed out that the}} {{penalization}} of one eye by means of patching or atropine drops does not provide the conditions <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> in order to develop or improve binocular vision. Recently, efforts have been made to propose alternative treatments of amblyopia that do allow for the improvement of binocular sight, for example using binasal occlusion or partially frosted spectacles in place of any eye patch, using alternating occlusion goggles or using methods of perceptual learning based on video games or virtual reality games for enhancing binocular vision.|$|E
25|$|The above-described {{idea of a}} hypercycle's {{robustness}} {{results from}} an exponential growth of its constituents caused by the catalytic support. However, Eörs Szathmáry and Irina Gladkih showed that an unconditional coexistence can be obtained even {{in the case of}} a non-enzymatic template replication that leads to a subexponential or a parabolic growth. This could be observed during the stages preceding a catalytic replication <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> for the formation of hypercycles. The coexistence of various non-enzymatically replicating sequences could help to maintain a sufficient diversity of RNA modules used later to build molecules with catalytic functions.|$|E
