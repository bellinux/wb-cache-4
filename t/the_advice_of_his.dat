5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{attorney}} Percy Foreman, Ray {{pleaded guilty}} to avoid a trial conviction and thus the possibility of receiving the death penalty. He was sentenced to a 99-year prison term.|$|E
5|$|By February, the Germans were in full retreat. On February 23, 1945, the U.S. 94th Infantry Division {{crossed the}} Saar and {{established}} a vital bridgehead at Serrig through which Patton pushed units into the Saarland. Patton had insisted upon an immediate crossing of the Saar River against <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> officers. Historians such as Charles Whiting have criticized this strategy as unnecessarily aggressive.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{informed}} Baldwin that {{he would}} abdicate {{if he could not}} marry Simpson. Baldwin then presented Edward with three choices: give up the idea of marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate. It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married against <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis. He chose to abdicate.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{he drove}} on by <b>the</b> treacherous <b>Advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> new Counsels, till he ripen'd all the Nation {{for the general}} Defection which {{afterward}} follow'd.|$|R
5000|$|The film premiered at the World Cinema in Copenhagen on November 13, 1943. Dreyer always {{denied the}} film as being {{analogous}} to persecution of Jews. However, on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends he left Denmark on the pretext of selling Day of Wrath in foreign markets and {{spent the rest of}} the war in Sweden shortly after the film's release.|$|R
5000|$|Dario Franchitti {{announced}} his retirement from motorsport on <b>the</b> medical <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> doctors following his accident in the Sunday race of the 2013 Grand Prix of Houston. In December, Kanaan was announced as Franchitti's replacement in the No. 10 car.|$|R
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> older brother, Breckinridge {{obtained}} his law license on January 3, 1824, but {{the practice}} of law did not suit him. He instead decided to follow the family tradition and seek public office, campaigning for a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives. Even in his early political career, he began to articulate his stance on the issues that would become his legacy.|$|E
5|$|Here, Brock met Tecumseh, and was {{immediately}} impressed. Brock also read American dispatches captured from Hull's army. He quickly judged Hull to be timid and afraid of the First Nations in particular, and the American force to be demoralised and short of rations. Against <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> officers, Brock immediately prepared to launch an attack on Detroit.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the many}} factors in his success was Como's insistence on his {{principles}} of good taste; if he considered something to be in bad or questionable taste, {{it was not in}} the show or broadcast. When a remark made by Julius La Rosa about television personality Arthur Godfrey on The Perry Como Show was misconstrued, Como offered an on-air apology {{at the beginning of his}} next show, against <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> staff.|$|E
50|$|Several Norse {{variants}} of this ballad exist, although the {{man does not}} reject <b>the</b> woman on <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends in them.|$|R
50|$|In private life, {{he spends}} most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{time with his}} best friend, junior doctor Dr. Martin Dear and is in a {{relationship}} with Kim Alabaster from human resources. Contrary to <b>the</b> prevailing <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chosen profession, he also smokes, normally with Kim's fellow co-worker Naughty Rachel.|$|R
50|$|After {{the war in}} 1946 he {{returned}} to the Black Forest and reopened Kolleg St. Blasien against <b>the</b> initial <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> superiors, but with significant material assistance of Pope Pius XII via Madre Pascalina Lehnert. In 1949, he initiated the formation of a nationwide Jesuit alumni association.|$|R
5|$|Under modern {{constitutional}} conventions, {{the sovereign}} acts on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> or her ministers. Since these ministers most often enjoy {{the support of}} parliament and obtain the passage of bills, it is improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent. Hence, in modern practice, royal assent is always granted; a refusal {{to do so would}} be appropriate only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch's reserve powers.|$|E
5|$|When he {{was made}} aware of the new deal, Waylon was not sure if he should quit his gig at JD's. He then went to get <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friend, RCA artist Willie Nelson, who had gone to see one of Waylon's shows. When Willie and Waylon met, after talking about the {{possibilities}} and considering Waylon's profits at the club, Nelson suggested that Waylon should stay in Phoenix and not to move to Nashville.|$|E
5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though it would keep him out for an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
50|$|On 7 January 2007, {{he moved}} to Halmstads BK to play in Allsvenskan, on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> both <b>his</b> father and former Halmstads BK player Michael Svensson. On 1 May 2008, he was loaned out to Vaasan Palloseura after {{suffering}} illness {{as well as a}} lack of playing time with Halmstads.|$|R
5|$|During the Chancellery project, the pogrom of Kristallnacht took place. Speer made {{no mention}} of it in the first draft of Inside the Third Reich, and it was only on <b>the</b> urgent <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{publisher}} that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Synagogue in Berlin from his car.|$|R
500|$|Part II: The [...] "Child of Our Time" [...] appears, {{enmeshed in}} the drama <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{personal}} fate and the elemental social forces of our day. The drama is because the forces which drive the young man prove stronger than <b>the</b> good <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> uncle and aunt, as it always was and always will be.|$|R
5|$|Al-Mu'tadid {{died at the}} Hasani palace on 5 April 902, at the age {{of either}} 40 or 47. There were rumours that he had been poisoned, but {{it is more likely that}} the rigours of his campaigns, coupled with his dissolute life, {{severely}} weakened his health. During his final illness, he refused to follow <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> physicians, and even kicked one of them to death. He left behind him four sons and several daughters. Al-Mu'tadid was the first Abbasid caliph to be buried within the walls of Baghdad. Like his sons after him, he was buried in the former Tahirid palace in the western part of the city, which was now used by the caliphs as a secondary residence.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} William experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral. He abolished the cat o' nine tails for most offences other than mutiny, attempted {{to improve the}} standard of naval gunnery and required regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated more. Holding the office permitted him to make mistakes and learn from them—a process {{that might have been}} far more costly if he had not learnt before becoming King that he should act only with <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> councillors.|$|E
5|$|From the 18th century, the Sovereign {{made his}} or her choices {{on the advice of}} the Government. In 1946, with the {{agreement}} of the Prime Minister Clement Attlee and the Leader of the Opposition Winston Churchill, membership of the United Kingdom's highest ranking orders of chivalry (the Order of the Garter, the Order of the Thistle and the dormant Order of St. Patrick) became a personal gift of the Sovereign once again. Thus, the Sovereign personally selects Knights and Ladies Companion of the Garter, and need not act on or solicit <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> or Her Government.|$|E
50|$|Legal {{proceedings}} terminated in August 2013 with {{a multimillion-dollar}} out-of-court settlement with taxpayers footing the bill. In October 2013, the Victorian ombudsman George Brouwer decided {{to launch an}} investigation to address Guys decision to rezone the Ventnor site, against <b>the</b> original <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> department, <b>the</b> departments lawyers, the local Bass Coast shire and an independent planning panel.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{after graduating}} {{secondary}} school, Foujita wished {{to study in}} France, but on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> Mori Ōgai (<b>his</b> father's senpai military physician) he decided to study western art in Japan first.|$|R
5000|$|Based on his {{experience}} and consulting with Keast, in 1936 he conceived an initial plantation {{which the company}} established at Freemans shaft. Though still working as an assayer for the Central Mine (a rival mining company), Morris provided <b>the</b> honorary <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> expertise, and helped with organising the collection of seedlings for this planting. This first green area eventually became known as Albert Morris Park.|$|R
5|$|In 1844, Breckinridge's wife Ann died. Lingering {{sadness and}} {{memories}} of his and Ann's life in Baltimore may have led {{him to leave the}} city and the pastorate he had held for twelve years. He was offered pastorate of the Second Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky, but instead, accepted the presidency of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1845 against <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brothers John and William. A rift between Breckinridge and his brother Cabell's widow and other relatives may help account for this surprising decision. He did not feel he could yet return to his home state.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Henderson {{graduated}} from Oakland Technical High School, {{where he played}} baseball, basketball and football, and was an All-American running back {{with a pair of}} 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He also ran track, but did not stay with the team as the schedule conflicted with baseball. Henderson received over a dozen scholarship offers to play football. Despite a childhood dream to play for the Oakland Raiders, he turned down the scholarships on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mother, who argued that football players had shorter careers. In 1983, Henderson married his high-school sweetheart, Pamela. They have three children: Angela, Alexis, and Adrianna.|$|E
5|$|In February 1938, on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> newly {{appointed}} foreign minister, the strongly pro-Japanese Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler ended the Sino-German {{alliance with the}} Republic of China to instead enter into an alliance with the more modern and powerful Empire of Japan. Hitler announced German recognition of Manchukuo, the Japanese-occupied state in Manchuria, and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan. Hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army. In retaliation, Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek cancelled all Sino-German economic agreements, depriving the Germans of many Chinese raw materials.|$|E
5000|$|From the mid-1960s, {{engineers}} (John) Phil Ray and Austin O. [...] "Gus" [...] Roche {{were working}} for General Dynamics Dynatronic Division in Florida, {{as part of a}} computing contract team for NASA to enable President John F. Kennedy's vision of putting a man on the moon. At the time, mainframe computers were large room-filling pieces of equipment, for which data was input using dumb and noisy Teletype terminals. On <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tutors from the University of Texas, Ray and Roche decided to develop a quieter and smaller input device based on using a television set screen.|$|R
5000|$|Sargent, who {{was under}} arrest, refused {{to testify at}} any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{hearings}} on <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> counsel. In <b>his</b> report <b>of</b> the accident to the officials of the railroad company, he made the following statement: ...|$|R
6000|$|It may {{be added}} {{that after he}} had rebuilt the church for the second time, and {{numbered}} all the [...] "Menzi-herd" [...] among his congregation, which he did now that [...] "the bull of the herd" [...] was dead, as Menzi had foretold that he would, if Tabitha, whom he had [...] "wrapped with his blanket," [...] decreed it, Thomas took <b>the</b> sage <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> departed enemy.|$|R
5|$|In February 2007, Wotton {{was granted}} a {{separate}} trial from his co-accused in the Brisbane District Court since the allegations in the prosecution case against the other co-accused were prejudicial to Wotton's case. Wotton then pleaded guilty {{to the charge of}} rioting. In late March, after Wotton had already applied to withdraw his guilty plea on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> legal representatives (including his then barrister Marcus Einfeld), Wotton's co-accused were acquitted by a jury of rioting causing destruction. Wotton's application to withdraw his plea was granted by Nase DCJ on 26 April 2007. A few days later, Wotton was released on bail with strict conditions and ordered to return in April 2008 to be tried.|$|E
5|$|In Han government, {{the emperor}} was the supreme judge and lawgiver, the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the armed}} forces and sole designator of official nominees appointed to the top posts in central and local administrations; those who earned a 600-bushel salary-rank or higher. Theoretically, there were no limits to his power. However, state organs with competing interests and institutions such as the court conference (tingyi 廷議)—where ministers were convened to reach majority consensus on an issue—pressured the emperor to accept <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ministers on policy decisions. If the emperor rejected a court conference decision, he risked alienating his high ministers. Nevertheless, emperors sometimes did reject the majority opinion reached at court conferences.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1857, FitzGerald {{resigned}} from Parliament on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> doctors, and also {{decided not to}} seek re-election as provincial Superintendent. Robert Heaton Rhodes offered a requisition to Brittan to make himself available for the by-election that would result from FitzGerald's resignation from Parliament in the Lyttelton electorate, but Brittan replied {{that he could not}} absent himself from his private affairs as yet; Parliament at that time met in Auckland, and the 1858 session lasted from 10 April to 21 August, which required an absence from home for several months. Instead, Crosbie Ward, the editor and proprietor of the Lyttelton Times, was the only person nominated on 28 May 1858 and was thus declared elected.|$|E
5000|$|Under <b>the</b> {{inspiration}} and <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> close associate Ram Prasad Bismil, Khanna devoted {{his whole life}} {{to the service of}} the people and established half a dozen institutions in the rural sector <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home district Shahjahanpur viz; ...|$|R
50|$|But by {{this time}} the Mughals were no longer the army they were earlier feared to be. Aurangzeb, against <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{experienced}} generals, continued the war. Aurangzeb's position was much like that of Alexander on the borders of Taxila.|$|R
50|$|In some Islamic sects, Abraham's {{father is}} {{believed}} to have been a disbelieving man, due to his refusal to listen to <b>the</b> constant <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> son. In fact, the earliest story involving Abraham in the Quran is his discussion with his ab (أَب, which can mean 'father'). The name given for this man in the Qur'an is 'Āzar' (ءازَرُ), though Arab genealogists related the name of Abraham's father as 'Ṫāraḥ' (تَارَح).|$|R
