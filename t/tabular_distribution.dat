40|$|Lateritisation is {{associated}} with tropical climates and geomorphic conditions of peneplanation where hydromorphic processes of weathering predominate. Laterites are products of relative (residual) and absolute(chemical) accumulation after leaching of mobile constituents. Their major element chemistry {{is controlled by the}} aluminous character of bedrock and drainage. Bauxitisation is characterised by residual gibbsite neoformation and lateritisation, by both residual accumulation and hydromorphic precipitation of goethite controlled by the redox front at the water table. The laterite forms part of a weathering profile that is underlain by saprock, saprolite, the mottled zone and overlain by a soil horizon. The secondary gold in laterites has its source invariably with mineralised bedrock. The distribution of secondary gold is controlled by mechanical eluviation and hydromorphic processes governed by organic, thiosulphate and chloride complexing. The precipitation of secondary gold is controlled by pH conditions, stability of the complexing agent and ferrolysis. Gold-bearing laterites are Cainozoic in age and are best developed on stable Archean and Proterozoic cratons that have suffered epeirogenesis since lateritisation. Mechanical eluviation increases in influence at the expense of hydromorphic processes as a positive function of topographic slope and degradation rate. Gradients greater than 10 ⁰ are not conducive for lateritisation, with latosols forming instead. High vertical degradation rates may lead to the development of stone lines. In the Western Australian case, post-laterite aridification has controlled the redistribution of secondary gold at levels marked by stabilisation of the receding palaeowater table. Mineable reserves of lateritic ore are located at Boddington, Westonia and Gibson toward the south-west of the Yilgarn Block. A significant controlling variable appears to be the concentration of chloride in the regolith. Based on the Boddington model, the laterite concentrates the following elements from bedrock gold lodes: i) Mo, Sb, W, Hg, Bi and Au as mobile constituents. ii) As and Pb as immobile constituents. Geochemical sampling of ferruginous lag after bedrock and laterite has provided dispersed anomalies that are easily identifiable. "Chalcophile corridors" up to 150 km in length are defined broadly by As and Sb but contain more discrete anomalies of Bi, Mo, Ag, Sn, W, Se or Au, in the Yilgarn Block. The nature of the weathered bedrock, the <b>tabular</b> <b>distribution</b> of secondary gold ore deposition and the infrastructural environment lends the lateritic regolith to low cost, open-cut mining. The western Australian lateritic-gold model perhaps can be adapted and modified for use elsewhere in the world. ...|$|E
40|$|Much {{effort in}} recent years has been spent on {{attempts}} to optimize the numerical problem of calculating elastic and inelastic multigroup scattering matrices from basic ENDF/B data. This paper presents an algorithm which minimizes the amount of data manipulation and approximation required. The algorithm is based on avoiding time-consuming transformations between c. m. and lab coordinates for the differential cross section and the additional requirement with the ETOG algorithm to manufacture Legendre expansion coefficients if <b>tabular</b> <b>distributions</b> are given. The new algorithm was incorporated into the ETOP code, which generates elastic and inelastic scattering matrices for the 68 -group Phrog II fast spectrum code. CPU time is roughly a factor of 4 faster than the ETOG algorithm in the most favorable cases for ETOG. (RWR...|$|R

Three methods were proposed to differentiate and separate both of the jogging and walking data set, they are statistical <b>tabular,</b> scatter <b>distribution</b> and artificial classifier recognition. Linear decision boundary and radial basis function kernel (RBF) were proposed to perform the separation works for artificial classifier recognition section.

Four species from Cameroon are described as new and a species of Hymenostegia, also from Cameroon, is transferred to Talbotiella bringing {{the number of species}} in Talbotiella to eight: T. bakossiensis Cheek, T. batesii Baker f., T. breteleri (AubrÃ©v.)

The study examined the unique factors and variables which were assumed to have influence on women participation in distance education programmes. The variables investigated were the extent to which women characteristics, programme, study materials, support services and attitude had influence on women enrolment at the OUT. The study was a micro one carried out in Dar es Salaam City. Data were collected through questionnaires, observations, interviews and content/document review. Quantitative data were tabulated into <b>tabular,</b> frequency <b>distribution</b> and percentages. Qualitative data were subjected to content analysis. It was found that family responsibilities, particularly child bearing, are a unique factor influencing women enrollment at the OUT.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} comprehensive {{survey of the}} printed Austro-German ensemble-music repertoire from the period ca. 1630 - 1700, a corpus comprising approximately 120 publications. After {{a consideration of the}} composers represented, the varied functions for which the music was intended, and general aspects of publication, detailed attention is given to the related questions of genre and the character of the prints themselves. Their contents and internal organization are examined in depth, revealing, by comparison with Italian, French, and English practices, a distinctively Austro-German approach in the grouping of pieces to form larger structures. As has been observed in the contemporaneous Italian repertoire, however, the labels applied to individual genres are often vague and imprecise. By contrast, and in a further parallel with the Italian sources, it is shown that the numerical terminology applied to performing forces is largely free of ambiguity. ^ The following aspects of the repertoire are summarized in <b>tabular</b> form: geographical <b>distribution</b> of publications; types of publications; re-publication; missing works; genre; organizational principles; texture and instrumentation; basso continuo practices; and ad libitum practices. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{content of}} {{molecular}} gas in galaxies, mainly H 2, {{is one of}} the key observations necessary for the understanding of star formation processes and history. As the CO molecule is the most widely distributed molecule after H 2 and has easily observable mm lines, it is used as a tracer for the molecular gas. CO was detected towards the direction where the H alpha and 6 cm radio continuum emission is strongest (Hummel et al. 1986). Here, researchers present the Gaussian line parameters in <b>tabular</b> form. The <b>distribution</b> of CO corresponds well with the intense HI cloud near the bar of NGC 55. The extent of the CO cloud is about 975 pc perpendicular to the major axis. As the radio continuum and the H alpha emission also peaks in this region, it is most probably associated with the star forming region in NGC 55. Assuming that the molecular gas is in virial equilibrium, researchers derive a mass of about 8 times 10 (exp 7) solar magnitude. The molecular mass found indicates that the conversion factor for the molecular mass in Irr galaxies as inferred from CO line emission is indeed higher by up to a factor of 20 compared to the canonical value for the Galaxy...|$|R
