5|$|The Ottomans faced {{numerous}} opponents between 1424 and 1453. Tied down by {{the siege}} of Thessalonika, the Ottomans had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Serbs under George Brankovic, the Hungarians under John Hunyadi and the Albanians under George Kastrioti Skanderbeg. This resistance culminated into the Crusade of Varna of 1444, which, despite much local support and deception - a peace treaty was unilaterally revoked by the Hungarians - was defeated.|$|E

However, the department had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fact that no universally accepted standards for recording smog existed at that time, and many of the flaws existed {{for lack of a better}} alternative. During the 1966 smog, one of the former commissioners said he would have readily adopted a better system, if one existed.|$|E

5|$|New {{economic}} forces also changed the Commonwealth. Virginian James Albert Bonsack invented the tobacco cigarette rolling machine in 1880 leading to new {{industrial scale production}} centered on Richmond. In 1886, railroad magnate Collis Potter Huntington founded Newport News Shipbuilding, which was responsible for building six major World War I-era battleships for the U.S. Navy from 1907 to 1923. During the war, German submarines like U-151 attacked ships outside the port. In 1926, Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin, rector of Williamsburg's Bruton Parish Church, began restoration of colonial-era buildings in the historic district with financial backing of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Though their project, like others in the state, had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression and World War II, work continued as Colonial Williamsburg became a major tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|William II {{had named}} Constance, the {{daughter}} of Roger II who married future HenryVI, Holy Roman Emperor his heiress. As the noblemen {{did not want to}} be ruled by a German, Tancred of Lecce seized the throne under their support, but he had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> revolt of his distant cousin Roger of Andria and the invasion of Henry on behalf of his wife. Initially Roger was tricked into execution and Henry had to retreat after his attack failed, with Constance even captured and only released under the pressure of the Pope. Tancred died in 1194, and Constance and Henry eventually prevailed and the kingdom fell in 1194 to the House of Hohenstaufen, with William III of Sicily the young son of Tancred deposed. Henry and Constance were crowned as king and queen. Through Constance, the Hauteville blood was passed to FrederickII, Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E

He invested an additional $50 million to refurbish outlets and $20 {{million on a}} new computer system to link outlet cash registers to the kitchen, drive-through window, manager's office and company headquarters. Cranor also expanded the chain into non-traditional locations, beginning with a 150 sq ft limited menu kiosk at a General Motors assembly plant in Dayton, Ohio. Between 1986 and 1991, the chain built a further 2,000 outlets to bring its total number to 8,500, and sales grew from $3.5 to $6.2 billion. The chain had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rise of grilled chicken as Americans became increasingly health conscious. KFC found itself competing against the growing El Pollo Loco restaurant chain, {{as well as with}} Burger King, which had just introduced the BK Broiler, a grilled chicken burger.

5|$|In early 1990, the drivers' {{contract}} from 1987 expired {{at the end}} of its three-year term. In March, the ATU began its strike against Greyhound. The 1990 drivers' strike was similar in its bitterness to the strike of 1983, with violence against both strikers and their replacement workers. One striker in California was killed by a Greyhound bus driven by a strikebreaker, and a shot was fired at a Greyhound bus. During the strike by its 6,300 drivers, Greyhound idled much of its fleet of 3,949 buses and cancelled 80% of its routes. At the same time, Greyhound was having <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rise of low-cost airlines like Southwest Airlines, which further reduced the market for long-distance inter-city bus transportation. Without the financial strength provided in the past by a parent company, the strike's lower revenues and higher costs for security and labor-law penalties caused Greyhound to file for bankruptcy in June 1990. The strike would not be settled for 38 months under terms favorable to Greyhound. While the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had awarded damages for unfair labor practices to the strikers, this liability was discharged during bankruptcy reorganization.|$|E
5|$|Lodge later {{claimed the}} South Vietnamese {{prosecutors}} {{failed to make}} any case against Cẩn. The Vietnamese leader also had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{other side of the}} arguments, from those who considered themselves to be victims of the Diệm regime. During the trial, Thích Trí Quang, along with other opponents of the old regime, lobbied for a death sentence for Cẩn. He argued that if Cẩn lived, he could regain power along with his late brothers' supporters. He told Lodge that if the Americans did not support a tough sentence, then the Vietnamese Buddhist community's opinion of Washington would fall. Lodge was initially critical of Quang's campaigning against Cẩn. Cẩn was sentenced to death. He appealed to the head of state for clemency; his lawyers used a provision in the legal code to make the appeal. This placed Minh — who was still the titular head of state — in the position of approving a third death in the Ngô family, having already ordered his bodyguard Nguyễn Văn Nhung to execute Diệm and Nhu during the coup.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew of the}} Obsidian have {{temporarily}} {{abandoned the}} vessel {{in order to allow}} it to pass through a black hole. The Obsidian's internal systems are capable of withstanding the black hole, but the station cannot shield its human inhabitants from the gravitational forces. The crew have taken refuge in a smaller craft which has been shielded, intending to return to the Obsidian when both vessels have passed through the black hole. A radiation storm has damaged the Obsidian's engine protection systems and erased its flight path, leaving the station drifting towards the black hole where it will be destroyed. Only one member of the crew has the skills necessary to return to the Obsidian and prepare it to pass through the black hole, this is the game's player character. The astronaut is forced <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Obsidian's re-activated security system which has resulted in security robots being deployed, the space station's internal doors sealing and defensive laser grids becoming active. Once the player has restored power, reactivated the Obsidian's engines and reset the station's flight path, there is a limited time to teleport back to the smaller shielded craft before the Obsidian's engines carry the astronaut through the black hole without being shielded.|$|E

5|$|Toirdelbach Ua Briain died in 1086, and the Kingdom of Munster was {{partitioned}} {{between his}} three surviving sons: Muirchertach (died 1119), Diarmait (died 1118), and Tadc. The latter expired {{only a month}} after his father, after which Muirchertach drove Diarmait from Munster altogether, seizing the kingship for himself. Muirchertach then embarked upon extending his authority throughout Ireland. During this period, Muirchertach not only had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> opposing forces of his surviving brother, but also those of the Meic Taidc, the sons of his deceased brother. In 1091, however, the Meic Taidc appear to have {{come to terms with}} Muirchertachat least temporarilyas the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters reports that a peace was agreed between him and the Meic Taidc, who are nonetheless said to have acted treacherously towards Muirchertach's men. Although Muirchertach appears to have regained control of the Kingdom of Dublin by 1090, he soon after lost it to Gofraid Crobán, King of the Isles (died 1095), until he forced the latter from the kingship of Dublin once and for all in 1094. It may have been at this point that Muirchertach installed his son, Domnall Gerrlámhach (died 1135), to the kingship. Another possibility, however, is that Muirchertach instead appointed Domnall himself after Gofraid's expulsion.|$|E
5|$|Before the 12th century, Jain writers had {{dominated}} Kannada literature {{with their}} champu (verses mixed with prose) style of writings popular in court literature. In the later medieval period, they had <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Veerashaivas who challenged {{the very notion}} of royal literature with their vachana poetry, a stylised form of spoken language, more popular in folk genres. The popular growth of Veerashaiva (devotees of the Hindu god Shiva) literature began in the 12th century, while Vaishnava (devotees of the Hindu god Vishnu) writers began to exert their influence from the 15th century. Jain writers had to reinvent their art, moving away from the traditional themes of renunciation and tenets to focus on contemporary topics. Andayya's 13th century classic Kabbigara Kava ("Poets defender") was an early example of the change in literary style, and also reflected the hostility toward the Veerashaivas; the Jain author found it ideal to narrate the story of Manmatha, the God of Love, who turned Shiva into a half woman. The Veerashaivas had initiated an important change, casting aside the concept of formal literature and making way for shorter local genres. The Vaishnava haridasas later popularised musical forms that were more acceptable to the common man. Written classics eulogising kings and commanders were a thing of the past. Kannada literature had moved closer to the spoken and sung folk traditions, with singability being its hallmark, and devotion to God its goal.|$|E
5|$|Most procellariids' nests are in burrows or on {{the surface}} on open ground, with a smaller number nesting {{under the cover of}} {{vegetation}} (such as in a forest). All the fulmarine petrels bar the snow petrel nest in the open, the snow petrel instead nesting inside natural crevices. Of the rest of the procellariids the majority nest in burrows or crevices, with a few tropical species nesting in the open. There are several reasons for these differences. The fulmarine petrels are probably precluded from burrowing by their large size (the crevice-nesting snow petrel is the smallest fulmarine petrel) and the high latitudes they breed in, where frozen ground is difficult to burrow into. The smaller size of the other species, and their lack of agility on land, mean that even on islands free from mammal predators they are still vulnerable to skuas, gulls and other avian predators, something the aggressive oil-spitting fulmars are not. The chicks of all species are vulnerable to predation, but the chicks of fulmarine petrels can defend themselves in a similar fashion to their parents. In the higher latitudes there are thermal advantages to burrow nesting, as the temperature is more stable than on the surface, and there is no wind-chill <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> <b>with.</b> <b>The</b> absence of skuas, gulls and other predatory birds on tropical islands is why some shearwaters and two species of gadfly petrel can nest in the open. This has the advantages of reducing competition with burrow nesters from other species and allowing open-ground nesters to nest on coralline islets without soil for burrowing. Procellariids that burrow in order to avoid predation almost always attend their colonies nocturnally in order to reduce predation as well. Of the ground-nesting species the majority attend their colonies during the day, the exception being the herald petrel, which is thought to be vulnerable to the diurnal white-bellied sea eagle.|$|E
