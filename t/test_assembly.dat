40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2004. Low-voltage {{switchgear}} and controlgear assemblies with a rated short-circuit withstand strength above 10 kA, are required, by law, {{to conform}} to the South African standard, SANS 1473 - 1 (Low Voltage Switchgear and Controlgear Assemblies: Part 1 : Typetested, partially type-tested and specially <b>tested</b> <b>assemblies</b> with rated short-circuit withstand strength above lOkA). Standard SANS 1473 - 1 stipulates three categories of assemblies i. e. type-tested, partially type-tested and specially <b>tested</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The specially <b>tested</b> <b>assembly</b> is unique to the South African market, while the other two categories are stipulated in standard SANS IEC 60439 - 1 (Low Voltage Switchgear and Controlgear Assemblies: Part 1 : Type-tested and partially type-tested assemblies), which is internationally accepted in many countries as the applicable low-voltage assembly standard. Standard SANS 1473 - 1 specifies seven type-tests for certification as a type-tested assembly (TTA), but specifies, at most, three type-tests for certification as a specially <b>tested</b> <b>assembly</b> (STA). The underlying purpose of a technical standard is to provide for the safety of people and property, with the purpose of the research being twofold: 1. To investigate if the testing requirements specified for a specially <b>tested</b> <b>assembly</b> (STA), in accordance with standard SANS 1473 - 1, are correctly applied, and do not pose any safety risks. 2. To investigate any safety risks that stem from the fact that four type-tests are excluded for verification as a specially <b>tested</b> <b>assembly</b> (STA), as opposed to the seven type tests required for verification as a type-tested assembly (TTA). The document highlights the technical inadequacies of an assembly that is certified as a STA, in accordance with standard SANS 1473 - 1, and the potential safety risks associated with this type of assembly classification...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} were performed in which return loss and insertion loss of waveguide <b>test</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{in the frequency}} range from 325 to 508 GHz were measured by use of a swept-frequency two-port vector network analyzer (VNA) test set. The {{experiments were}} part of a continuing effort to develop means of characterizing passive and active electronic components and systems operating at ever increasing frequencies. The waveguide <b>test</b> <b>assemblies</b> comprised WR- 2. 2 end sections collinear with WR- 3. 3 middle sections. The test set, assembled from commercially available components, included a 50 -GHz VNA scattering- parameter test set and external signal synthesizers, augmented with recently developed frequency extenders, and further augmented with attenuators and amplifiers as needed to adjust radiofrequency and intermediate-frequency power levels between the aforementioned components. The tests included line-reflect-line calibration procedures, using WR- 2. 2 waveguide shims as the "line" standards and waveguide flange short circuits as the "reflect" standards. Calibrated dynamic ranges somewhat greater than about 20 dB for return loss and 35 dB for insertion loss were achieved.

50|$|The use of drywall shaft-wall {{systems has}} been common for many years. 3-D full scale fire testing (e.g., ISO 6944) {{resulted}} in the first certification listing for an inherently fire-resistant duct. Drywall systems were tested as flat walls, but not as a three-dimensional solution surrounding a real duct with four corners. Shaft-wall systems are tested to the same standards as all other fire barriers, such as ASTM E119 and ULC S101. These standards mandate thermocoupling {{in the middle of}} the <b>test</b> <b>assemblies,</b> in each quadrant and joints. However, no thermocouples go at the interface between the <b>test</b> <b>assemblies</b> and the surrounding structure, which is the closest thing to a corner. Wall Interfaces are fireproofed by the test labs before fire testing, a fact worth consideration in permitting corners in on-site configurations.|$|R
