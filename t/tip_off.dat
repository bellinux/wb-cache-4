5|$|Public {{attitudes towards}} feral cats vary widely, ranging from seeing them as free-ranging pets, to {{regarding}} them as vermin. One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed 'trap-neuter-return', where the cats are trapped, neutered, immunized against {{diseases such as}} rabies and the feline Panleukopenia and Leukemia viruses, and then released. Before releasing them back into their feral colonies, the attending veterinarian often nips the <b>tip</b> <b>off</b> one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated, since these cats may be trapped again. Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives. Given this support, their lifespans are increased, and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced.|$|E

25|$|When the {{proclamation}} for the apprehension of Avery {{and his crew}} reached Trott, {{he was forced to}} either put a warrant out for Avery's arrest or, failing to do so, effectively disclose his association with the pirate. Preferring the former choice {{for the sake of his}} reputation, he alerted the authorities as to pirates' whereabouts, but was able to <b>tip</b> <b>off</b> Avery and his crew before the authorities arrived. Avery's 113-person crew then fashioned their hasty escape, vanishing from the island with only twenty-four men ever captured, six of whom were executed. Avery himself was never seen again. His last words to his men were a litany of conflicting stories of where he planned to go, likely intended to throw pursuers off his trail.|$|E
