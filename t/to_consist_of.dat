5|$|On 15 February 1959, it was {{organized}} <b>to</b> <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> the 1st Battle Group, 65th Infantry, {{an element of}} the 92nd Infantry Brigade. On February 21, 1960, commemorated as National Guard Day, the 65th Infantry Regiment was formally transferred from the Regular Army to the PRNG, in an activity where Gen. Cesár Cordero handed the units colors to Col. Rafael Rodríguez. That same year, Company B of the 65th Regiment created Employer's Day (Día del Patrono in Spanish) where the employer's of the volunteers that serve in the PRNG are instructed about the job that their employees do with the entity and participate in training of their own. The idea behind the initiative was facilitating the processing of the request of leave-of-absence to train for two weeks during the summer. On 1 May 1964, it was reorganized <b>to</b> <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> the 1st Battalion, 65th Infantry, and remained assigned to the 92nd. It was reorganized again on 1 April 1971, <b>to</b> <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> the 1st Battalion and the separate Company E. This was followed by another reorganization on 1 September 1978, <b>to</b> <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> the 1st and 2nd Battalions within the 92nd, as well as the separate Company E. Less than two years later another reorganization on 29 February 1980, eliminated the separate Company E while retaining the 1st and 2nd Battalions.|$|E
5|$|Bike {{maneuverability}} {{and handling}} {{is difficult to}} quantify for several reasons. The geometry of a bike, especially the steering axis angle makes kinematic analysis complicated. Under many conditions, bikes are inherently unstable and must always be under rider control. Finally, the rider's skill has a large influence on the bike's performance in any maneuver. Bike designs tend <b>to</b> <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> a trade-off between maneuverability and stability.|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with Nedeljković's orders, Marić's 27th Infantry Division Savska was {{to undertake a}} counterattack against the Gyékényes bridgehead on 8 April. Supported by two batteries of Skoda 75 mm Model 1928 mountain guns of the 27th Artillery Regiment, the attack consisted of three columns converging on the bridgehead. The right column, attacking from the area of Bregi, was <b>to</b> <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> the 2nd Cavalry Regiment supported by the divisional machine gun company. The centre column, consisting of the 53rd Infantry Regiment and {{the remnants of the}} 2nd Battalion of the 36th Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion of the 35th Infantry Regiment, directly supported by the 1st Battery of the 27th Artillery Regiment, would attack from Koprivnica. The left column, attacking from the vicinity of Herešin, was <b>to</b> <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> the dismounted 81st Cavalry Regiment. As promised support from the 36th Infantry Regiment, 81st Cavalry Regiment and army-level artillery had not materialised, Marić postponed the counterattack to 16:00. When it was eventually launched, only the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and the 1st Squadron of the 81st Cavalry Regiment remained in contact with the Germans, south of Peteranec, and the 2nd Cavalry Regiment held that area throughout the night of 8/9 April, despite heavy German artillery fire. Of the other units involved in the counterattack, most were only at 25 percent of their full strength due to Ustaše-influenced desertions sparked by the rebellion within the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska. Two battalions of the 36th Infantry Regiment deserted during 8 April.|$|E

5|$|The IUCN {{currently}} recognizes {{only one}} species of giraffe with nine subspecies. In 2001, a two-species taxonomy was proposed. A 2007 {{study on the}} genetics of Giraffa, suggested they were six species: the West African, Rothschild's, reticulated, Masai, Angolan, and South African giraffe. The study deduced from genetic differences in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that giraffes from these populations are reproductively isolated and rarely interbreed, though no natural obstacles block their mutual access. This includes adjacent populations of Rothschild's, reticulated, and Masai giraffes. The Masai giraffe was also suggested <b>to</b> <b>consist</b> <b>of</b> possibly two species separated by the Rift Valley.|$|E
