40|$|In the {{framework}} of the StraVARIA project (Autonomy Considerations for Stratospheric High Altitude Pseudo-Satellites made in BAVARIA) a comprehensive weather situation map as decision support for UAVs was newly developed. For this tool, certain weather data (observations, nowcasts, and forecasts) containing information on hazards endangering the mission or the UAV structure itself like <b>thunderstorms,</b> <b>turbulence,</b> wind and cloud cover are combined using a so-called NoGo-Area approach. Using this approach we receive weather objects out of complete data fields which should be avoided by UAVs. All information on the NoGo-Areas, like precise spatial coordinates and time signatures, are stored within a newly developed XML-format. The total of our XML-files, including information on all weather hazards, is seen as the comprehensive weather situation map. It can be used as decision support for UAVs regarding a long-term mission (trajectory) planning and short-term avoidance of weather hazards...|$|R

50|$|Contingency plans {{exist within}} the North Atlantic Track system {{to account for}} any {{operational}} issues that occur. For example, if an aircraft can no longer maintain the speed or altitude it was assigned, the aircraft can move off the track route and fly parallel to its track, but well away from other aircraft. Also, pilots on North Atlantic Tracks are required to inform air traffic control of any deviations in altitude or speed necessitated by avoiding weather, such as <b>thunderstorms</b> or <b>turbulence.</b>|$|R
50|$|A flight {{dispatcher}} (also {{known as an}} aircraft dispatcher, airline dispatcher, flight follower or flight operations officer) assists in planning flight paths, taking into account aircraft performance and loading, enroute winds, <b>thunderstorm</b> and <b>turbulence</b> forecasts, airspace restrictions, and airport conditions. Dispatchers also provide a flight following service and advise pilots if conditions change. They usually work in the operations center of the airline. In the United States and Canada, the {{flight dispatcher}} shares legal responsibility with {{the commander of the}} aircraft (joint responsibility dispatch system).|$|R

50|$|The {{cause of}} the crash was the {{aircraft}} being flown in manual flight mode with excessive angles of attack causing a stall with a subsequent transition to a flat spin and collision with the ground at high vertical speed. The flight manual and crew training programs did not provide instruction on manual pitch control and pitch trim during high-altitude flight. The lack of appropriate simulators contributed to the crew’s lack of ability. While avoiding areas of <b>thunderstorms</b> and <b>turbulence,</b> the crew allowed the aircraft to enter pitch oscillations exceeding the angle of attack operational range. Lack of control over speed and not following the Flight Manual to prevent and recover from a stall and poor crew resource management allowed the situation to escalate into a catastrophic one.|$|R
50|$|Twenty-one NWS Center Weather Service Units (CWSU) are {{collocated}} {{with the}} Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC). Their main {{responsibility is to}} provide up-to-the-minute weather information and briefings to the Traffic Management Units and control room supervisors. Special emphasis is given to weather conditions that could be hazardous to aviation or impede the flow of air traffic in the National Airspace System. Beside scheduled and unscheduled briefings for decision-makers in the ARTCC and other FAA facilities, CWSU meteorologists also issue two unscheduled products. The Center Weather Advisory (CWA) is an aviation weather warning for <b>thunderstorms,</b> icing, <b>turbulence,</b> and low cloud ceilings and visibilities. The Meteorological Impact Statement (MIS) is a two- to 12-hour forecast that outlines weather conditions expected to impact ARTCC operations.|$|R

40|$|The {{focal point}} of the study {{reported}} here was the definition and examination of turbulence, wind shear and thunderstorm in relation to aviation accidents. NASA project management desired this information regarding distinct subgroups of atmospheric hazards, in order to better focus their research portfolio. A seven category expansion of Kaplan's turbulence categories was developed, which included wake turbulence, mountain wave turbulence, clear air turbulence, cloud <b>turbulence,</b> convective <b>turbulence,</b> <b>thunderstorm</b> without mention of turbulence, and low altitude wind shear, microburst or turbulence (with no mention of thunderstorms). More than 800 accidents from flights based in the United States during 1987 - 2008 were selected from a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) database. Accidents were selected for inclusion in this study if <b>turbulence,</b> <b>thunderstorm,</b> wind shear or microburst was considered either a cause or a factor in the accident report, and each accident was assigned to only one hazard category. This report summarizes the differences between the categories in terms of factors such as flight operations category, aircraft engine type, the accident's geographic location and time of year, degree of injury to aircraft occupants, aircraft damage, age and certification of the pilot and the phase of flight {{at the time of the}} accident...|$|R
25|$|On 2 September 1925, Shenandoah {{departed}} Lakehurst on {{a promotional}} {{flight to the}} Midwest that would include flyovers of 40 cities and visits to state fairs. Testing of a new mooring mast at Dearborn, Michigan, {{was included in the}} schedule. While passing through an area of <b>thunderstorms</b> and <b>turbulence</b> over Ohio early in the morning of 3 September, during its 57th flight, the airship was caught in a violent updraft that carried it beyond the pressure limits of its gas bags. It was torn apart in the turbulence and crashed in several pieces near Caldwell, Ohio. Fourteen crew members, including Commander Zachary Lansdowne, were killed. This included every member of the crew of the control cabin (except for Lieutenant Anderson, who escaped before it detached from the ship); two men who fell through holes in the hull; and several mechanics who fell with the engines. There were twenty-nine survivors, who succeeded in riding three sections of the airship to earth. The largest group was eighteen men who made it out of the stern after it rolled into a valley. Four others survived a crash landing of the central section. The remaining seven were in the bow section which Commander (later Vice Admiral) Charles E. Rosendahl navigated as a free balloon. In this group was Anderson who—until he was roped in by the others—straddled the catwalk over a hole.|$|R
2500|$|Accident {{investigators}} {{studied a}} scientific report titled The Thunderstorm {{published in the}} USA in 1949. This report proposed that where two thunderstorms were separated, edge to edge, by less than [...] there was a likelihood of severe turbulence in the clear air between the two. The accident investigators believed it was likely that Flight 325, while flying west between two mature <b>thunderstorms,</b> encountered strong <b>turbulence</b> that caused the crew to lose control and the aircraft to lose {{a significant amount of}} height and enter the thunderstorm to the south of the airport. While flying north, possibly in an attempt to escape the thunderstorm, the crew encountered continuing strong turbulence that caused control to be lost again. The aircraft accelerated to its maximum safe speed or faster and while the crew were struggling to regain control the aircraft was suddenly subjected to extreme turbulence that caused the right wing and the right tailplane to fail.|$|R
50|$|The 747 {{jumbo jet}} {{encounters}} massive <b>thunderstorms,</b> and the <b>turbulence</b> releases {{one of the}} scientists from the cargo hold. Two of the scientists go below to ascertain if the container has been damaged by the turbulence, and are also killed, starting a zombie outbreak. The uninfected passengers must fight for survival aboard the flight. No government will allow the infected airliner to land, leaving the survivors stranded in the sky with their ravenous tormentors. Billy, his wife Anna, Burrows, Frank, Paul, and Megan, a stewardess aboard the plane, are all that are left of the uninfected people. They must {{make their way to}} the cockpit and signal a fighter jet behind them that there are still living people aboard the 747 or the fighter will destroy them. After managing to get a MP5K machine gun from a dead guard, Burrows, Frank and Billy make their way from the tail of the plane to the cockpit, while the couple stay behind. Billy is bitten but manages to kill some of the undead passengers, while Anna comes to help Billy she gets bitten but kills the Undead by thrusting an umbrella into its mouth. After that they both get surrounded, Billy opens the emergency exit and most of the infected get sucked out.|$|R
40|$|Wind and Ports" is a European {{project that}} {{has been carried out}} since 2009 to handle wind {{forecast}} in port areas through an integrated system made up of an extensive in-situ wind monitoring network, the numerical simulation of wind fields, the statistical analysis of wind climate, and algorithms for medium-term (1 - 3 days) and short term (0. 5 - 2 hours) wind forecasting. The in-situ wind monitoring network, currently made up of 22 ultrasonic anemometers, provides a unique opportunity for detecting high resolution thunderstorm records and studying their dominant characteristics relevant to wind engineering with special concern for wind actions on structures. In such a framework, the wind velocity of thunderstorms is firstly decomposed into the sum of a slowly-varying mean part plus a residual fluctuation dealt with as a non-stationary random process. The fluctuation, in turn, is expressed as the product of its slowly-varying standard deviation by a reduced turbulence component dealt with as a rapidly-varying stationary Gaussian random process with zero mean and unit standard deviation. The extraction of the mean part of the wind velocity is carried out through a moving average filter, and the effect of the moving average period on the statistical properties of the decomposed signals is evaluated. Among other aspects, special attention is given to the <b>thunderstorm</b> duration, the <b>turbulence</b> intensity, the power spectral density and the integral length scale. Some noteworthy wind velocity ratios that {{play a crucial role in}} the thunderstorm loading and response of structures are also analyze...|$|R
40|$|FLYSAFE is an Integrated Project of the 6 th {{framework}} of the European Commission aiming at improving flight safety {{through the development of}} a Next Generation Integrated Surveillance System (NGISS). The NGISS will provide information to the pilot on a number of external hazards, with particular emphasis on weather, air traffic and terrain. One of its advantage will be the capability of displaying data about all three hazards on a single screen, facilitating rapid pilot assessment of the situation. In order to improve the accuracy of warnings provided to aircraft in flight, specialised tools for generating nowcasts of atmospheric hazards are under development: the Weather Information Management Systems (WIMSs). Four types of WIMSs feeding the NG-ISS were defined, each addressing one hazard: clear air <b>turbulence,</b> <b>thunderstorms</b> (CB), icing (ICE), and wake vortices. These products are generated by on-ground systems from observations and model forecasts. To evaluate the impact of these new kind of information during realistic in-flight conditions, as well as to test the NG-ISS abilities, severe weather high resolution simulations were performed. Meteorological synthetic outputs feed the WIMS, and a flight simulator including the NG-ISS. We focus here on synthetic ICE and CB WIMS diagnosed from two heavy precipitating events simulations in the vicinity of airports. The first one is a deep convection situation over the Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, on the 23 rd of June, 2005. The second occurred on the 20 th of September, 1999 during the Mesoscale Alpine Program (MAP-IOP 2 B) near the Innsbruck airport. These two simulated events will be discussed, as well as weather hazards provided by ICE and CB WIMSs. ...|$|R
