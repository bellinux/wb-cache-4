2500|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Venezuela {{has been extended}} to {{an increasing number of}} people during the 2000s, although many poor remain without access to piped water. Service quality for those with access is mixed, with water often being supplied only on an intermittent basis and most wastewater not being treated. Non-revenue water is estimated to be high at 62%, compared to the regional average of 40%. Tap water is relatively inexpensive, because of a national tariff freeze imposed in 2003 and a policy not to recover capital costs. Investments are financed primarily by the national government, with little reliance on external financing. The sector remains centralized despite a decentralization process initiated in the 1990s that has now been stalled. Within the executive, sector policies are determined by the Ministry of Environment. The national water company HIDROVEN serves about 80% of the population. The remainder is being served by five state water companies, the Corporación Venezolana de Guayana (CVG), a few municipalities and community-based organizations. Since the early 2000s the government encouraged the creation of about 7,500 Mesas Tecnicas del Agua, which have both a <b>technical</b> <b>function</b> and a political mobilization function. Major investment projects include the restoration of the polluted Valencia Lake and of the [...] in Caracas (2005–2013).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{proof is}} given that in design methods, the {{relation}} between <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> and their subfunctions in functional descriptions of technical products cannot be analysed as a formal relation of parthood. This result holds for design methods in which transformations of flows of energy, material and signals are accepted as functions. First, two specific categories of such <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> are modelled. Second, the composition relation by which ordered sets of these functions define other functions is characterised. Third, it is shown that this composition relation for <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> {{does not meet the}} basic postulates of parthood relations as given by mereology, the theory of parthood. It still may be beneficial to designing to take subfunctions informally as the parts of the functions they compose. Yet, the proof shows that when functional descriptions are formalised for, for instance, the development of automated design reasoning tools or for incorporation in engineering ontologies, the composition relation for <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> cannot unconditionally be taken as a parthood relation.

40|$|Current {{philosophical}} theorizing about <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> {{is mainly}} focused on specifying {{conditions under which}} agents are justified in ascribing <b>functions</b> to <b>technical</b> artifacts. Yet, assessing the precise explanatory relevance of such function ascriptions is, by and large, a neglected topic {{in the philosophy of}} technical artifacts and <b>technical</b> <b>functions.</b> We assess the explanatory utility of ascriptions of <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> in the following three explanation-seeking contexts: (i) why was artifact x produced?, (ii) why does artifact x not have the expected capacity to I center dot?, (iii) how does artifact x realize its capacity to I center dot? We argue that while function ascriptions serve a mere heuristic role in the first context, they have substantial explanatory leverage {{in the second and third}} context. In addition, we assess the relevance of function ascriptions in the context of engineering redesign. Here, function ascriptions also play a relevant role: (iv) they enable normative statements of the sort that component b functions better than component a. We unpack these claims by considering philosophical theories of <b>technical</b> <b>functions,</b> in particular the ICE theory, and engineering work on function ascription and explanation. We close the paper by relating our analysis to current debates on the explanatory power of mechanistic vis-A -vis functional explanations...|$|R

The approach introduces a Function-Task Design Matrix to link <b>technical</b> <b>functions</b> with user tasks and to capture relevant affordance-level requirements throughout the product architecture generation.

50|$|Microthermoforming is the {{abbreviation}} for microscopic or microscale thermoforming, or, more precisely, for thermoforming of microproducts or microstructure products. Microstructure products means products that have {{structures in the}} micrometre range and have their <b>technical</b> <b>function</b> provided by {{the shape of the}} microstructure 1. Thermoforming 2 in turn means shaping of heated and therefore softened semi finished products in the form of thermoplastic polymer films or plates with their edges fixed by three-dimensional stretching. Shaping is carried out mainly by forming the films or plates into female moulds (negative forming) or over male moulds (positive forming). While the other polymer microreplication processes such as micro injection moulding or (vacuum) hot embossing are primary forming processes where forming occurs already in a molten, liquid phase of the heated polymer material, microthermoforming is a secondary forming process where forming occurs in a strongly softened, but still solid phase of the heated polymer.|$|E
