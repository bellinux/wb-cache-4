25|$|Before Kim Jong-un {{had been}} {{confirmed}} as Kim Jong-il's successor and Kim Jong-chul was groomed as the country's next leader, a limited set of Kim Jong-chul badges were reportedly made {{and given to}} cabinet, party, and army officials.

25|$|An {{officer of}} the Santa Hermandad has a warrant for Quixote's arrest for freeing the galley-slaves. The priest begs for the officer to have mercy on account of Quixote’s insanity. The officer agrees, and Quixote is locked in a cage and made to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an enchantment {{and that there is}} a prophecy of his heroic return home. While traveling, the group stops to eat and lets Quixote out of the cage, and he gets into a fight with a {{goatherd}} and with a group of pilgrims, who beat him into submission, and he is finally brought home. The narrator ends the story by saying that he has found manuscripts of Quixote's further adventures.|$|E
25|$|District Councillor Amy Yung Wing-sheung, {{who lives}} in Discovery Bay, said the company was not {{conducting}} a proper consultation. She said the company had gone ahead with its plan after proposals were rejected unanimously at a recent Passenger Liaison Group meeting. HKR International is upset that its monopolised ferry service to its monopolised residential complex at Discovery Bay is not making enough money for the executives of HKRI to continue living anywhere but Discovery Bay. The monopolized project with too close an association with the government. This monopoly {{is evident in the}} ferry and bus services, the commercial sites, the shops available and the sale of flats. The residents of Discovery Bay <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> time that this monopoly was reviewed.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authorities}} also {{equate the}} town named Menapia (or Manapia) as Wexford town – others place it further {{north along the}} east coast, roughly near Wicklow town. A river called the Modonnu(s), whose estuary is near Menapia, is often {{said to be the}} Slaney – others think it is the Avoka river. It is because the Slaney is the only major river in the south-east that many as a result <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the Modonnu(s) river, thereby making Menapia equal to Wexford town (this theory only seems to work if Hook Head is made the Sacred Cape). Most authorities seem to agree that Menapia is not Wexford, but is a town located further north along the coast. However, this is not certain.|$|E

25|$|Such a {{phenomenon}} was observed, but not photographed, in the Owens Valley of California. Early {{in the morning}} with no wind, thin clouds were observed to form above the valley. The distinction was that they were created alternately and moved in opposite directions away from a central location on the valley floor, suggesting the existence of an inaudible free convection whistle. The reason for including this type of whistle is that we tend to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> necessary for a forced jet flow to encounter a solid material to create a whistle. Perhaps it would be more correct to generalize the concept to a particular impedance mismatch rather than a solid object. The Hartmann whistle and the jet screech fits into this generalization. The concept also applies to any fluid motion as opposed to a strictly forced flow.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} two interpretations of Chen's actions during the {{election}} in terms of independence politics. The first {{is that he is}} ideologically committed to advancing Taiwan independence and that his actions are intended to systematically remove the constraints which prevent this from occurring. Seen in this light, his actions are intended to provoke a crisis in which the PRC must either start a war or accept independence, with the expectation that the PRC would back down. Ironically, this interpretation of his actions is shared both among his most fervent supporters (who think it is a good thing) and his most bitter opponents (who <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a bad thing). It is largely to counter this possibility that the PRC has issued statements that it will definitely go to war if certain red lines are crossed. However, they in reality carry little meaning, as Beijing has made such statements warning against electing former President Lee and Chen in the 1996 and 2000 elections, which both failed to materialize. Some people regard these statements now as reverse psychology, as Lee and Chen may help to weaken ROC and advance the unification process.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{situation}} has been noticed, {{in order for}} a bystander to intervene they must interpret the incident as an emergency. According to the principle of social influence, bystanders monitor the reactions of other people in an emergency situation to see if others <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> necessary to intervene. If it is determined that others are not reacting to the situation, bystanders will interpret the situation as not an emergency and will not intervene. This is an example of pluralistic ignorance or social proof. Referring to the smoke experiment, even though students in the groups had clearly noticed the smoke which had become so thick that it was obscuring their vision, irritating their eyes or causing them to cough, they were still unlikely to report it. Only one participant in the group condition reported the smoke within the first four minutes, {{and by the end of}} the experiment, no-one from five of eight groups had reported the smoke at all. In the groups that did not report the smoke, the interpretations of its cause, and the likelihood that it was genuinely threatening was also less serious, with no-one suggesting fire as a possible cause, but some preferring less serious explanations, such as the air-conditioner was leaking.|$|E

500|$|The medieval {{churches of}} St Nicholas, Blakeney and St Margaret's, Cley, and the now ruined Blakeney friary, {{were not the}} first {{religious}} buildings in the area. An early church was recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book at Esnuterle ("Snitterley" [...] was a former name for Blakeney, the current name first appearing in 1340), but the 11th-century church's location is unknown, {{and there is no}} reason to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> on the site of the 'chapel'.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{am not in}} a {{position}} to corroborate Mr Lyons' account of being corrected, prompted and advised by Garda officers and his description of learning from them about the details of the admissions they were seeking. However Mr Lyons' account to me in our interview supported and was consistent with the earlier impressions I had gained from reading the case papers. In my earlier report I noted that the materials then available to me raised questions about whether the details of Mr Lyons' final admissions could have derived from the content of questions put to him during the day, rather than his knowledge and memory, and about whether he was unusually suggestible. Following my interview with Dean Lyons and his parents, these concerns are substantially strengthened and I now <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> very likely that his detailed admissions were unreliable." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} term at Arnold House Waugh found few {{opportunities}} to continue his writing. He was tired {{by the end of}} the day, his interest in The Temple flagged, and from time to time his attention wandered to other subjects; he contemplated a book on Silenus, but he admitted that it [...] "may or may not ... be written". After the Easter holidays he felt more positively about The Temple: [...] "I am making the first chapter a cinema film, and have been writing furiously ever since. I honestly <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> going to be rather good". He sometimes worked on the book during classes, telling any boys who dared to ask what he was doing that he was writing a history of the Eskimos. By June he felt confident enough to send the first few chapters to his Oxford friend Harold Acton, [...] "asking for criticism and hoping for praise". Earlier that year Waugh had commented warmly on Acton's book of poems, An Indian Ass, [...] "which brought back memories of a life [...] infinitely remote".|$|E

2500|$|Later, an instanton liquid {{model was}} studied. This model starts from the {{assumption}} that an ensemble of instantons cannot be described by a mere sum of separate instantons. Various models have been proposed, introducing interactions between instantons or using variational methods (like the [...] "valley approximation") endeavoring to approximate the exact multi-instanton solution as closely as possible. Many phenomenological successes have been reached. Whether an instanton liquid can explain confinement in 3+1 dimensional QCD is not known, but many physicists <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> unlikely.|$|E
2500|$|James Whale called Stuart {{back for}} just one scene in The Kiss Before the Mirror, but the critic Hall wrote, [...] "There are those who may <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> too bad to {{introduce}} {{as one of the}} players the dainty Gloria Stuart and have her killed off in the first episode of the narrative.

2500|$|Bourdieu {{also played}} a crucial role in the popularisation of {{correspondence}} analysis and particularly multiple correspondence analysis. Bourdieu held that these geometric techniques of data analysis are, like his sociology, inherently relational.

It is a procedure that 'thinks' in relations, as I try to do it with the concept of field," [...] Bourdieu said, in the preface to The Craft of Sociology.|$|E
