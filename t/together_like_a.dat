It {{is known that}} Ma Yuan (14 BC– 49 AD) created a raised-relief map in 32 AD made out of rice, a type of map described in detail during the Tang Dynasty (618–907) by Jiang Fang in his Essay on the Art of Constructing Mountains with Rice (c. 845). Xie Zhuang (421–466) of the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479) created a 0.93 m2 (10ft2) wooden raised-relief map of the empire (showing mountains and rivers) which could be taken apart and pieced <b>together</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> giant jigsaw puzzle. Shen Kuo also created his own raised-relief map using sawdust, wood, beeswax, and wheat paste.|$|E
5|$|If {{the account}} of Sima Qian (c. 145–86 BC) in his Records of the Grand Historian is proven correct upon the {{unearthing}} of Qin Shi Huang's (r. 221–210 BC) tomb, the raised-relief map has existed since the Qin Dynasty (221–206 BC). Robert Temple and Joseph Needham suggest that certain pottery vessels of the Han Dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) showing artificial mountains as lid decorations may have influenced the raised-relief map. The Han Dynasty general Ma Yuan (14 BC – 49 AD) made a raised-relief map of valleys and mountains in a rice-constructed model of 32 AD. Such rice models were expounded on by the Tang Dynasty (618–907) author Jiang Fang in his Essay on the Art of Constructing Mountains with Rice (c. 845 AD). A raised-relief map made of wood representing all the provinces of the empire and put <b>together</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> giant 0.93 m2 (10ft2) jigsaw puzzle was invented by Xie Zhuang (421–466 AD) during the Liu Song Dynasty (420–479).|$|E

25|$|At {{least some}} of our {{behaviour}} must be influenced by our genes because behaviour depends on the interaction of molecules and neurons in the brain. These interactions {{are a result of}} our genes code, however the influence on behaviour cannot go much further than this. Dawkins likened genes to a computer. They have been pre-programmed to build cells, develop cells and make them work <b>together.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> computer, the hardware is set in stone, but the software can change how they work, just like our environment. Genes indirectly influence our behaviour as the nervous system and our brain is the intermediary in the transaction decision because it reasons and processes all of the gene instructions into one decision, movement or behaviour. The way our neurons connect is dependent on the environment, learning and experience. This introduces the nurture side of the nature nurture debate.|$|E

25|$|The CNS {{consists}} of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes that are generated from multipotent stem cells. NCRP Report No. 153 provides the following excellent and short {{introduction to the}} composition and cell types of interest for radiation studies of the CNS: “The CNS {{consists of}} neurons differing markedly in size and number per unit area. There are several nuclei or centers that consist of closely packed neuron cell bodies (e.g., the respiratory and cardiac centers in {{the floor of the}} fourth ventricle). In the cerebral cortex the large neuron cell bodies, such as Betz cells, are separated by a considerable distance. Of additional importance are the neuroglia which are the supporting cells and consist of astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and microglia. These cells permeate and support the nervous tissue of the CNS, binding it <b>together</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> scaffold that also supports the vasculature. The most numerous of the neuroglia are Type I astrocytes, which make up about half the brain, greatly outnumbering the neurons. Neuroglia retain the capability of cell division in contrast to neurons and, therefore, the responses to radiation differ between the cell types. A third type of tissue in the brain is the vasculature which exhibits a comparable vulnerability for radiation damage to that found elsewhere in the body. Radiation-induced damage to oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells of the vasculature accounts for major aspects of the pathogenesis of brain damage that can occur after high doses of low-LET radiation.” Based on studies with low-LET radiation, the CNS is considered a radioresistant tissue. For example: in radiotherapy, early brain complications in adults usually do not develop if daily fractions of 2 Gy or less are administered with a total dose of up to 50 Gy. The tolerance dose in the CNS, as with other tissues, depends on the volume and the specific anatomical location in the human brain that is irradiated.|$|E
500|$|Georgia Tech coach John Heisman later {{described}} Strupper as follows:"Everett Strupper {{was a small}} {{package of}} condensed lightning when you turned him loose in an open field with a ball you wanted delivered somewhere {{in the neighborhood of}} the enemy's goal line.

[...] In this way, one of the ideas they connected was the universality of long-distance relationships, the pain and heartache of which they were able to incorporate in [...] "Miles Away". After recording it, Timberlake commented that he had helped in creating a classic Madonna song, saying [...] "I couldn't do a song like that, [...] I thought it was completely her.

500|$|... "Within You Without You" [...] was {{included}} on the 2006 remix album Love, which was created for the Cirque du Soleil stage show of the same name. Harrison's vocal appears over the rhythm section from [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows", after the track opens with Lennon's lyric from the latter song. Reviewing the album for PopMatters, Zeth Lundy writes: [...] "The 'Within You Without You'/'Tomorrow Never Knows' mash-up, perhaps the most thrilling and effective track on the entire disc, fuses two especially transcendental songs into one:... a union of two ambiguous, open-ended declarations of spiritual pursuit." [...] Paul Moody of Uncut similarly considers {{it to be the}} [...] "best of all" [...] the mashups on Love, with the two tracks' [...] "cosmic drones... fitted <b>together</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> glove". In their chapter on the Beatles' psychedelic period in The Cambridge Companion to the Beatles, authors Russell Reising and Jim LeBlanc describe [...] "Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] as [...] "the most musically and visually stunning segment" [...] of the Cirque du Soleil show.|$|E
500|$|Timberlake was {{impressed}} by the amount of recording material Madonna would already have ready.

[...] Madonna decided to have discussions between herself and Timberlake to develop other ideas for the songs. One of the ideas they connected on was the universality of long-distance relationships, which they felt was too personal for them, but nevertheless used the concept in [...] "Miles Away". Madonna commented on the recorded version: [...] "We put our stuff out there. [...] And after we did the song, everybody in the studio was like, 'Oh, I can relate to that.'" ...|$|E

Roberts, whose fee was paid by subscribers to a defence fund to represent nine of the men. Jones, representing Condon and O'Brien, clashed with the court almost immediately because the accused were handcuffed, saying [...] "It appears to be discreditable to the administration of justice that men whom the law presumes to be innocent should be brought into Court handcuffed <b>together</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> couple of hounds." [...] Jones also objected to the presence of a number of soldiers in the courtroom, and when the magistrate refused to order the prisoners' handcuffs to be removed he [...] "marched dramatically" [...] out of the courtroom saying [...] "Then {{as a member of the}} Bar I decline to sit in any Court where the police override the Magistrate...

500|$|The Beach Boys's leader, Brian Wilson, was {{responsible}} for the musical composition and virtually all of the arrangement for [...] "Good Vibrations". His cousin and bandmate Mike Love contributed the song's lyrics and its bass vocalization in the chorus. During the recording sessions for the 1966 album Pet Sounds, Wilson began changing his writing process. Rather than going to the studio with a completed song, he would record a track containing a series of chord changes he liked, take an acetate disc home, and then compose the song's melody and write its lyrics. For [...] "Good Vibrations", Wilson said, [...] "I had a lot of unfinished ideas, fragments of music I called 'feels.' Each feel represented a mood or an emotion I'd felt, and I planned to fit them <b>together</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mosaic." [...] Most of the song's structure and arrangement was written as it was recorded. Engineer Chuck Britz is quoted saying that Wilson considered the song to be [...] "his whole life performance in one track". Wilson stated: [...] "I was an energetic 23-year-old. ... I said: 'This is going to be better than [...] "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'."'" ...|$|E

500|$|However, Internet {{film critic}} James Berardinelli, {{in spite of}} {{awarding}} it {{two and a half}} stars out of four, gave the film a somewhat scathing review. On his website, Berardinelli wrote that [...] "Meet the Parents is put <b>together</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> TV sit-com," [...] that Roach [...] "strings together a series of hit-and-miss lowbrow gags with little care for whether any of the connecting material is coherent, interesting, or enjoyable (in most cases, it's none of those three)" [...] and concluding that [...] "even with Stiller and De Niro, Meet the Parents is an encounter that can be postponed until it's available on video." [...] Jeff Vice of the Deseret News, another detractor of the film, proclaimed Meet the Parents [...] "only erratically funny" [...] and accused Roach of taking [...] "the cheap way out with a series of unfunny jokes." [...] Critic Peter Bradshaw's review of the film in The Guardian concludes that Meet the Parents [...] "is somehow less than the sum of its parts. It strains to come to life, but never quite makes it." [...] After the film was released on home media, DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone magazine contributor Douglas Pratt in his book Doug Pratt's DVD: Movies, Television, Music, Art, Adult, and More! stated that [...] "perhaps in the crowded theater the film is hysterical, but in the quieter venue of home video, it just seems sadistic, and as the humor evaporates, the holes in the plot become clearer." ...|$|E
