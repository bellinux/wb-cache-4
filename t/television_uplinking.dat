5000|$|The term Television receive-only, or TVRO, arose {{during the}} early days of {{satellite}} television reception to differentiate it from commercial satellite <b>television</b> <b>uplink</b> and downlink operations (transmit and receive). This was the primary method of satellite television transmissions before the satellite television industry shifted, with the launch of higher powered DBS satellites in the early 1990s which transmitted their signals on the Ku band frequencies. Satellite television channels at that time were intended to be used by cable television networks rather than received by home viewers. Early satellite television receiver systems were largely constructed by hobbyists and engineers. These early TVRO systems operated mainly on the C-band frequencies and the dishes required were large; typically over 3 meters (10 ft) in diameter. Consequently, TVRO {{is often referred to as}} [...] "big dish" [...] or [...] "Big Ugly Dish" [...] (BUD) satellite television.|$|R

50|$|WBTS is one {{of several}} Boston <b>television</b> {{stations}} <b>uplinked</b> to provide U.S. network programming to television providers in Canada, particularly in Atlantic Canada. On November 11, 2016, Canadian telecommunications company Bell Canada, which distributes Boston's broadcast network affiliates on its satellite, IPTV, and cable TV services in much of eastern Canada and via satellite uplink to other providers, filed a request with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to add WBTS's main feed to the CRTC's list of foreign television channels authorized for distribution in Canada, which was additionally supported by Rogers Cable for their systems in Atlantic Canada. The request was approved by the CRTC on December 20, 2016; television providers who carried WHDH, including Bell, Eastlink, SaskTel, Telus Optik TV and Rogers among others, replaced the station with WBTS on January 1, 2017. Eastlink in the Maritimes switched from WHDH to WBTS on December 31, 2016 and broadcast First Night New Years celebrations in the Canadian East.|$|R

50|$|Ku band is {{primarily}} used for satellite communications, most notably for fixed and broadcast services, and for specific {{applications such as}} NASA's Tracking Data Relay Satellite used for both space shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) communications. Ku band satellites are also used for backhauls and particularly for satellite from remote locations back to a television network's studio for editing and broadcasting. The band is split by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) into multiple segments that vary by geographical region. NBC was the first <b>television</b> network to <b>uplink</b> a majority of its affiliate feeds via Ku band in 1983.|$|R
