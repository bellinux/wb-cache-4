5|$|As {{the episode}} ends, Olivia's {{hallucination}} of Peter points {{out to her}} {{that there is a}} way to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> she is from the prime universe: by confirming her memories of her niece Ella, who did not survive birth in the parallel universe. During Olivia's final test in the tank, she is again able to cross over to the gift shop in the prime universe. She is able to recall Ella's phone number and calls her, but is brought back to the parallel universe shortly after Ella answers. As she is removed from the tank, she lies, telling Walternate the test did not work.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{states that}} zinc damages nerve receptors in the nose, causing anosmia. Reports of anosmia were also {{observed}} in the 1930s when zinc preparations were used in a failed attempt to prevent polio infections. On June 16, 2009, the FDA ordered removal of zinc-based intranasal cold products from store shelves. The FDA said the loss of smell can be life-threatening because people with impaired smell cannot detect leaking gas or smoke, and cannot <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> food has spoiled before they eat it.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Gospel of the Ebionites, the Gospel of the Hebrews, and the Gospel of the Nazarenes remains unclear. All the Jewish–Christian gospels survive only as fragments in quotations, so {{it is difficult to}} <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> they are independent texts or variations of each other. Scholar Albertus Klijn established the modern consensus, concluding that the gospel harmony composed in Greek appears to be a distinctive text known only to Epiphanius. Scholar Marie-Émile Boismard has claimed the Ebionite gospel is partly dependent upon a hypothetical Hebrew gospel as a source; however this conjecture remains a minority view. Its putative relationship to the gospel text known to Origen as the Gospel of the Twelve remains a subject of scholarly debate.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the storm}} had blown down {{telegraph}} lines in the area, two riders immediately set off for Roberts, ten miles to the south, and sent messages into St. Paul with news of the tornado. Altogether, the tornado and the subsequent fires that raged throughout the following night destroyed the entire business district along {{with more than half}} the residences in town, which combined added up to more than 300 buildings. The only significant surviving structures were the Lumber and Roller Mills located {{on the banks of the}} Willow River, the latter of which was narrowly missed by the tornado, the town's public school and the Catholic Church, which acted as either makeshift shelters or morgues. Only the extreme northwestern and southeastern portions of the city were spared. The town's electrical plant and water facilities were destroyed, so fires ran rampant through the scattered debris. Many bodies found in the aftermath were burnt beyond recognition— it was impossible to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> they died from the tornado or from being trapped and burned alive.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs diverged {{from their}} archosaur {{ancestors}} {{during the middle}} to late Triassic period, roughly 20million years after the Permian–Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95% of all life on Earth. Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 231.4 million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists think that Eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs; if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators. The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton in Argentinian Middle Triassic strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators. Dinosaurs may have appeared as early as 243 million years ago, as evidenced by remains of the genus Nyasasaurus from that period, though known fossils of these animals are too fragmentary to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> they are dinosaurs or very close dinosaurian relatives.|$|E
5|$|On May 30, the General Staff {{ordered the}} {{creation}} of a new battalion in Givati, the 57th, that would consist of about 200 Irgunists. A hundred rifles for the battalion were provided by Givati, with 50–80 more provided by the General Staff. The brigade commander Avidan also created two new companies, one in the 54th Battalion, and one in the 55th, consisting of 80 persons each. These combined forces were tasked with the mission of capturing the Arab Yibna (May 31), although the attack never materialized because the battalion took off completely unprepared, lost its way, and returned to its starting position. Also on May 30, four light planes set out from Sde Dov Airport to bomb the area of Isdud, although only one Rapide pilot spotted his target. He could not <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> any of the bombs actually exploded.|$|E

5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E
25|$|The body {{of another}} person was found at the crash site. It was so badly burned that {{investigators}} could not <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> it {{was that of a}} man or a woman. At first its identity was a mystery. But LACW Sedláková, the wife of Flt Sgt Sedlák, the flight engineer, had been reported missing after KG867 took off and she failed to return home to her flat in London.|$|E
25|$|After death, {{the body}} {{typically}} shows marks of suspension: bruising and rope {{marks on the}} neck. Sphincters will relax spontaneously and urine and faeces will be evacuated. Forensic experts may often be able to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> hanging is suicide or homicide, as each leaves a distinctive ligature mark. One of the hints they use is the hyoid bone. If broken, it often means the person has been murdered by manual choking.|$|E

5000|$|When {{facing an}} {{opposing}} batter, {{there is no}} way of <b>telling</b> <b>if</b> the batter is a switch hitter or not.

25|$|Objective tests assume {{personality}} is consciously accessible {{and that it}} can be measured by self-report questionnaires. Research on psychological assessment has generally found objective tests to be more valid and reliable than projective tests. Critics have pointed to the Forer effect to suggest some of these appear to be more accurate and discriminating than they really are. Issues with these tests include false reporting because {{there is no way to}} <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> an individual is answering a question honestly or accurately.|$|E
25|$|As {{a way of}} {{visualizing}} {{the choice}} of a gauge, consider whether it is possible to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> a cylinder has been twisted. If the cylinder has no bumps, marks, or scratches on it, we cannot tell. We could, however, draw an arbitrary curve along the cylinder, defined by some function θ(x), where x measures distance along the axis of the cylinder. Once this arbitrary choice (the choice of gauge) has been made, it becomes possible to detect it if someone later twists the cylinder.|$|E
25|$|For any finitely {{presented}} group {{it is easy}} {{to construct}} a (smooth) compact 4-manifold with it as its fundamental group. As there is no algorithm to tell whether two finitely presented groups are isomorphic (even if one is known to be trivial) there is no algorithm to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> two 4-manifolds have the same fundamental group. This is one reason why much of the work on 4-manifolds just considers the simply connected case: the general case of many problems is already known to be intractable.|$|E

25|$|The {{description}} of Nebuchadnezzar II in the Book of Daniel (2nd century BC) greatly influenced the medieval European concepts. Daniel 4 depicts God humbling the Babylonian king for his boastfulness; stricken mad and ejected from human society, he grows {{hair on his}} body and lives like a beast. This image was popular in medieval depictions of Nebuchadnezzar. Similarly, late medieval legends of Saint John Chrysostom (died 407) describe the saint's asceticism as making him so isolated and feral that hunters who capture him cannot <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> he is man or beast.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Defense {{returned}} the dead men's bodies {{to their families}} in mid-June, after al-Utaybi's family openly questioned the claims he'd committed suicide and requested his body for a second autopsy. Utaybi's family reported that the Saudi post-mortem had found that the DOD had retained his brain, heart, liver and kidneys. Each of the families had second autopsies done, but these were inconclusive. In each case, the US had kept organs of the throat, so pathology teams could not <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> the men had died by hanging or not.|$|E
25|$|A Member of the Legislative Assembly from 1900 onwards, {{he served}} as Premier Lomer Gouin's Minister of Public Works from 1907 to 1919. Elected Premier in 1920, {{at a time when}} the North American economy began {{experiencing}} difficulties that ultimately led to the Great Depression, he opposed U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal social democratic policies, saying he could not <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> it was fascism or communism. Instead, he vigorously encouraged the development by private enterprise of the massive forests and the mineral resources of what had been the Ungava Region and Nunavik that the Parliament of Canada had added to the Province of Quebec.|$|E

25|$|A {{change has}} also come over Voigt's voice lately, though it's hard to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> it's from weight loss or normal aging—controversy still rages over whether Maria Callas's drastic diets contributed to her rapid vocal decline. Not that Voigt as yet {{exhibits}} any of Callas's technical problems: Her voice {{continues to be}} reliably supported and under control. What is noticeable, however—earlier this season in Verdi's La Forza del Destino and now in Tosca—is a marked thinning of quality {{at the very center}} of the instrument, together with a slight acidity and tightening of the tone that has definitely taken the youthful bloom off, especially at the top.|$|E
25|$|Recombination {{frequency}} is {{a measure}} of genetic linkage and is used {{in the creation of a}} genetic linkage map. Recombination frequency (θ) is the frequency with which a single chromosomal crossover will take place between two genes during meiosis. A centimorgan (cM) is a unit that describes a recombination frequency of 1%. In this way we can measure the genetic distance between two loci, based upon their recombination frequency. This is a good estimate of the real distance. Double crossovers would turn into no recombination. In this case we cannot <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> crossovers took place. If the loci we're analysing are very close (less than 7 cM) a double crossover is very unlikely. When distances become higher, the likelihood of a double crossover increases. As the likelihood of a double crossover increases we systematically underestimate the genetic distance between two loci.|$|E
25|$|Surprisingly, gauge {{symmetry}} {{can give}} a deeper explanation {{for the existence of}} interactions, such as the electric and nuclear interactions. This arises from a type of gauge symmetry relating to the fact that all particles of a given type are experimentally indistinguishable from one another. Imagine that Alice and Betty are identical twins, labeled at birth by bracelets reading A and B. Because the girls are identical, nobody would be able to <b>tell</b> <b>if</b> they had been switched at birth; the labels A and B are arbitrary, and can be interchanged. Such a permanent interchanging of their identities is like a global gauge symmetry. There is also a corresponding local gauge symmetry, which describes the fact that from one moment to the next, Alice and Betty could swap roles while nobody was looking, and nobody would be able to <b>tell.</b> <b>If</b> we observe that Mom's favorite vase is broken, we can only infer that the blame belongs to one twin or the other, but we cannot tell whether the blame is 100% Alice's and 0% Betty's, or vice versa. If Alice and Betty are in fact quantum-mechanical particles rather than people, then they also have wave properties, including the property of superposition, which allows waves to be added, subtracted, and mixed arbitrarily. It follows that we are not even restricted to complete swaps of identity. For example, if we observe that a certain amount of energy exists in a certain location in space, there is no experiment that can tell us whether that energy is 100% A's and 0% B's, 0% A's and 100% B's, or 20% A's and 80% B's, or some other mixture. The fact that the symmetry is local means that we cannot even count on these proportions to remain fixed as the particles propagate through space. The details of how this is represented mathematically depend on technical issues relating to the spins of the particles, but for our present purposes we consider a spinless particle, for which {{it turns out that the}} mixing can be specified by some arbitrary choice of gauge θ(x), where an angle θnbsp&=nbsp&0° represents 100% A and 0% B, θnbsp&=nbsp&90° means 0% A and 100% B, and intermediate angles represent mixtures.|$|E
