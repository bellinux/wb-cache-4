40|$|Objective Following the {{licensure}} of 23 -valent {{pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine}} (23 vPPV) in 1989, a risk-group–only immunization {{policy was}} implemented in 1992 in England. The PPV programme was extended in 2003 to include all individuals 65 years and over. In England, this was phased in over 3 years. To ascertain {{the performance of the}} risk group policy in <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> of age and over and provide a baseline to estimate the impact of the universal elderly programme. Methods Information was gathered on vaccine uptake for the period 1989 – 2003 in England from a national survey of general practitioners (GPs) through NHS primary care trusts (PCTs), the prescription cost analysis (PCA) system and the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Results Between 1991 and 2003, 4. 5 million doses of PPV were prescribed. The GP survey found that by 2003, 29 % of <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> and over of age and 36 % of <b>those</b> 80 <b>years</b> of age over had received PPV. Sixty-two per cent of general practices had implemented a risk-group–only policy, 14. 4 % had targeted all <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> of age over and 14. 2 % had targeted all <b>those</b> 75 <b>years</b> of age over. The GPRD study found that 38 % of <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> over and 41 % of <b>those</b> 80 <b>years</b> over fell into one or more high-risk groups. By 2003, 36. 6 % of the high-risk group and 30. 2 % of all <b>those</b> 65 <b>years</b> over had ever been vaccinated. Vaccine uptake increased with age, with 52. 3 % of the high-risk group and 37 % of all <b>those</b> 80 <b>years</b> over having ever been vaccinated. Conclusions A large proportion of those in risk groups remained unvaccinated with PPV in 2003. Formal evaluation of the impact and effective...|$|R
