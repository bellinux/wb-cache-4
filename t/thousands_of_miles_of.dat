5|$|The Naturalist on the River Amazons, subtitled A Record of the Adventures, Habits of Animals, Sketches of Brazilian and Indian Life, and Aspects of Nature {{under the}} Equator, during Eleven Years of Travel, is an 1863 book by the British naturalist Henry Walter Bates about his {{expedition}} to the Amazon basin. Bates and his friend Alfred Russel Wallace set out to obtain new species and new evidence for evolution by natural selection, as well as exotic specimens to sell. He explored <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> the Amazon and its tributaries, and collected over 14,000 species, of which 8,000 were new to science. His observations of the coloration of butterflies led him to discover Batesian mimicry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Visual {{inspection}} {{based on}} closed circuit televi-sion surveys is used widely in North America {{to assess the}} condition of underground pipes. Although the human eye is extremely effective at recognition and classification, it is not suitable for assessing pipe defects in <b>thousand</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> pipeline because of fatigue, subjectivity, and cost. In this paper, simple, robust, and efficient image segmentation and classification algorithm for the automated analysis of scanned underground pipe images is presented. The experi-mental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can precisely segment and classify pipe cracks, holes, laterals, joints and collapse surface from underground pipe images...|$|R

25|$|Early {{discussions on}} {{building}} a dedicated polar exploration ship for the British government had considered replicating Fridtjof Nansen's purpose-built ship Fram but that vessel was {{designed specifically for}} working through the pack ice of the Arctic, while the British ship would have to cross <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> open ocean before reaching the Antarctic so a more conventional design was chosen. In charge of her overall design was W.E. Smith, one of the senior naval architects at the Admiralty, while the ship's engine, boilers and other machinery were designed by Fleet Engineer Philip Marrack.|$|E
25|$|Traditional Polynesian {{navigation}} {{was used}} {{for thousands of years}} to make long voyages across <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> the open Pacific Ocean. Navigators travelled to small inhabited islands using wayfinding techniques and knowledge passed by oral tradition from master to apprentice, often in the form of song. Generally each island maintained a guild of navigators who had very high status; in times of famine or difficulty they could trade for aid or evacuate people to neighboring islands. As of 2014, these traditional navigation methods are still taught in the Polynesian outlier of Taumako Island in the Solomons.|$|E

25|$|Glossopteris {{leaves are}} morphologically simple {{so there are}} few {{characters}} {{that can be used}} to differentiate species. Consequently, many past researchers have considered the Permian Glossopteris flora to be rather homogeneous with the same species distributed throughout the Southern Hemisphere. However, more recent studies of the more morphologically diverse fertile organs have shown that taxa had more restricted regional distributions and several intra-gondwanan floristic provinces are recognizable. Seeds, much too large to be wind-borne, could not have blown across <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> open sea, nor is it likely they have floated across vast oceans. Observations such as these led the Austrian geologist Eduard Suess to deduce that there had once been a land bridge between these areas. He named this large land mass Gondwanaland (named after the district in India where the plant Glossopteris was found). These same observations would also lend support to Alfred Wegener's Continental drift theory.|$|E
25|$|The Trafalgar Campaign was a {{long and}} {{complicated}} series of fleet manoeuvres {{carried out by the}} combined French and Spanish fleets; and the opposing moves of the Royal Navy during much of 1805. These were the culmination of French plans to force a passage through the English Channel, and so achieve a successful invasion of the United Kingdom. The plans were extremely complicated and proved to be impractical. Much of the detail was due to the personal intervention of Napoleon, who as a soldier rather than a sailor failed to consider the effects of weather, difficulties in communication, and the Royal Navy. Despite limited successes in achieving some elements of the plan the French commanders were unable to follow the main objective through to execution. The campaign, which took place over <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> ocean, was marked by several naval engagements, most significantly at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October, where the combined fleet was decisively defeated, and from which the campaign takes its name. A final mopping up action at the Battle of Cape Ortegal on 4 November completed the destruction of the combined fleet, and secured the supremacy of the Royal Navy at sea.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{being only}} a {{tropical}} storm while passing by Puerto Rico, Eloise produced extreme amounts of rainfall on the island, peaking at [...] in Dos Bocas. Other totals of [...] were common. The heavy rains resulted in severe flash flooding which killed 34 people, mostly from drownings, and left $60 million in damages. Several hundred people were injured, and the storm forced over 6,000 residents from their homes. Dozens of towns and villages were flooded, though Utuado, {{with a population of}} 35,000 at the time, was hit the hardest. The situation in that town was described as a [...] "total disaster"; four housing developments were under water, and dozens of vehicles were washed away. The flood waters submerged <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> roads and put several bridges out-of-service.|$|E
500|$|Like the Royal Navy, the Bombay Marine {{were spread}} across many <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> ocean, often {{leaving the country}} ships in the Persian Gulf undefended. As French raiders were rare in the Gulf, few country ships {{operated}} in convoys and so they [...] became targets for dhows and bhagalas operating from semi or completely independent harbours in Persia or along the Arabian Peninsula. In 1805, the fleets of Al Qasimi captured two large ships, Shannon and Trimmer; the small boats of the Al Qasimi, swarmed the larger merchant ships and massacred the crews. The Al Qasimi converted Trimmer into a formidable pirate ship. When the HEIC warship Mornington, which carried 24 cannon, attempted to recapture Trimmer a few months later, nearly 40 Al Qasimi vessels attacked Mornington, which only just managed to escape destruction herself.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet Union {{covered over}} one sixth {{of the entire}} earth's landmass, {{and in the early}} 1920s its {{government}} decided to invest in the aviation industry. They concluded that expanding it in the Soviet Union would not only make travel more efficient and faster, it would also help build and develop the mostly farmland, enormously spread out nation that it was. At this time, most travel required taking trains (or, as was often the case, by off-road travel in cars, buses or trucks). Many of the northern and eastern territories in the Soviet Union were completely inaccessible during much of the year; most of these vast expanses of land lacked roads and railroads because of the huge distances between them and the nearest population centers. The practically uninhabitable weather also made travel and construction nearly impossible. The absence of [...] "surface transportation facilities" [...] also meant that very little equipment was available to use for road constructionâmaking the process even more daunting. Consequently, the Soviet government, always eager to save money in the transportation sector, concluded that building a series of airports scattered throughout the more desolate and isolated parts of the country would be far more economically efficient to than to build <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>miles</b> <b>of</b> roads (and/or railroads) for automobile/train travel. Air travel would be the best means of transportation for people and cargo. First, a fleet was necessary; between 1928 and 1932, the number of aircraft manufacturing facilities grew from twelve to thirty-one, while the nation's annual output of airplanes increased from a mere 608 to 2,509. After combining a number of existing fleets, the Soviet government founded the national airline and air service of the Soviet Union, renaming the [...] "USSR Civil Air Fleet" [...] Aeroflot.|$|E
