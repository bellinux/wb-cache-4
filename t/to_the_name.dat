5|$|The {{family name}} most likely {{derives from the}} Slavic kača (snake), the closest word <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Kačić. Based on etymology, {{it is likely that}} the Hungarian Kačićs (Kacsics) are {{originally}} of Slavic rather than Hungarian origin. Latin sources also refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> as de genere Chacittorum, generatione Cacich, genus Chacittorum, nobiles de Cacich, Caçici, Cacicii, Cacicli, Caciki, Cazethi, Cazichi, Cazziki, Chacichi and Kazzeti. The Kačić name is distinct from the similar-sounding name of another noble family, Kašić (Chasich), and its derivations (Kasig, Kasige).|$|E
5|$|Apeomyoides savagei was {{described}} as a new genus and species by Kent Smith, Richard Cifelli, and Nicholas Czaplewski in 2006. The generic name, Apeomyoides, adds the Greek suffix -ides, indicating similarity, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the related genus Apeomys, while the specific name, savagei, honors Donald E. Savage for his work on fossil mammals and for assistance to Smith. In the same paper, these scientists argued in favor of apeomyine affinities for Arikareeomys.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aemula {{was called}} wallum by the Kabi {{people of the}} Sunshine Coast, giving rise not only to its common name of wallum banksia but also <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the {{ecological}} community it grows in. Frederick Manson Bailey reported in 1913 that the indigenous people of Stradbroke Island knew it as mintie. Banyalla is another aboriginal name for the species.|$|E

5|$|On 26 May 2009 Osbourne {{filed suit}} in a federal court in New York against Iommi alleging that he {{illegally}} claimed the band name. Iommi noted {{that he has been}} the only constant band member for its full 41-year career, and that his bandmates relinquished their rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> in the 1980s, therefore claiming more rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the band. Although, in the suit, Osbourne was seeking 50% ownership of the trademark, he said that he hoped the proceedings would lead to equal ownership among the four original members.|$|E

5|$|As {{the company}} expanded, it {{was subject to}} several legal issues {{regarding}} trademarks. Because of its use {{as a case study}} in American law schools, {{one of the most prominent}} incidents of infringement in the United States occurred with the similarly named Burger King located in Mattoon, Illinois. Eugene and Elizabeth Hoots owned an ice cream shop in the city of Mattoon; due to the success of the store, in 1957 they expanded it with an additional shop in a former garage next to the original operation. Keeping with theme related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of the ice cream shop, Frigid Queen, they named their burger stand Burger King and registered their trademark with the state of Illinois in 1959. In 1962 The Hootses, with knowledge of the Federal trademark held by Burger King Corporation, added a second location in Charleston, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{diminutive}} size, the Church of St Nicholas {{was probably}} not constructed as an independent church. A legend links the church <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of an unidentified local feudal lord named Nikola (Nicholas) as his final resting place, though archaeologist Nikola Mavrodinov considers {{it more likely that}} it was possibly a chapel or a cemetery church attached to a larger place of worship. The larger church was perhaps pulled down during the early Ottoman rule of Bulgaria (post-14th century). While the Church of St Nicholas was not destroyed, its renovation was prohibited by the Ottomans, thus it gradually fell into ruin.|$|E

This {{was the only time}} in the periodical's history that a South American first lady appeared alone on its cover. (In 1951, Eva appeared again with Juan Perón.) However, the 1947 cover story was also the first publication to mention that Eva had been born out of wedlock. In retaliation, the periodical was banned from Argentina for several months.|$|E

5|$|Following {{their victory}} in the main event Los Infernales ended up facing off against and {{defeating}} the reigning Mexican National Trios Champions, Olímpico, Mr. Niebla and Safari at CMLL's next major event, Sin Piedad ("No Mercy"), although the championship {{was not on the}} line at the time. They were later able to use their non-title victory to be granted a championship match, winning the Mexican National Trios Championship on June 23, 2003. Los Nuevo Infernales reign as champions lasted 96 days, until they were defeated by La Familia de Tijuana (Damián 666, Halloween and Nicho el Millonario) on September 27, 2003. Averno and Mephisto turned on El Satánico shortly after the championship loss and formed their own group known as La Trada del Terror (the trio of terror) along with Ephesto, putting an end to Los Infernales just over a year after they won the rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>name.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1961, {{with its}} first {{location}} in Skokie, Illinois, Burger King Corporation and its franchises began opening stores and by 1967 had over 20 locations {{spread throughout the}} state.

Hoots 403 F.2d 904 (7th Cir. 1968). The decision issued by United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, and upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, stated that the BK federal trademark, applied for in 1961 and granted in 1963, took precedence over the Hootses' older, state trademark; The Court granted the Hootses exclusive rights to the Burger King trademark within a circular area defined with a 20-mile (32km) radius centered on their original location.|$|E
