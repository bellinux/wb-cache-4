5|$|The film {{contains}} several cameos from well-known {{actors and}} other celebrities, {{made possible by}} Hamer's high standing as a director. His previous film was the international production Factotum, {{based on the novel}} by Charles Bukowski, starring Matt Dillon, Lili Taylor, and Marisa Tomei. Some of the appearances are relatively brief; Nørby, for instance, is on screen for less <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes,</b> while the well-known Norwegian entertainer Trond Viggo Torgersen appears for only 59 seconds. Before the film's première on Boxing Day 2007, a pre-screening was held for journalists on 22 December.

5|$|After Sibelius's {{death in}} 1957, {{news of the}} Eighth Symphony's {{destruction}} was made public, and {{it was assumed that}} the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since then, several short manuscript sketches have been tentatively identified with the Eighth, three of which (comprising less <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> of music) were recorded by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra in 2011. While a few musicologists have speculated that, if further fragments can be identified, {{it may be possible to}} reconstruct the entire work, others have suggested that this is unlikely given the ambiguity of the extant material. The propriety of publicly performing music that Sibelius himself had rejected has also been questioned.|$|E
5|$|On 28 February, British {{pilots in}} Greece celebrated their biggest success in combat. No. 80 Squadron claimed 27 Italian {{aircraft}} without loss in 90 minutes of air combat.

The Italians claimed six Gladiators and one Supermarine Spitfire — none {{would be in the}} Mediterranean Theatre until March 1942 — while in fact only one Gladiator of No. 112 Squadron was lost, while two Blenheims, attacked by CR.42s had to crash-land returning to base.

5|$|In 1644, the Italian Jesuit Daniello Bartoli {{reported}} seeing two darker patches on Mars. During the oppositions of 1651, 1653 and 1655, when the planet made its closest {{approaches to the}} Earth, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli and his student Francesco Maria Grimaldi noted patches of differing reflectivity on Mars. The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed terrain features was the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens. On November 28, 1659 he made an illustration of Mars that showed the distinct dark region now known as Syrtis Major Planum, and possibly one of the polar ice caps. The same year, he succeeded in measuring the rotation period of the planet, giving it as approximately 24 hours. He made a rough estimate of the diameter of Mars, guessing that it is about 60% {{of the size of}} the Earth, which compares well with the modern value of 53%. Perhaps the first definitive mention of Mars's southern polar ice cap was by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, in 1666. That same year, he used observations of the surface markings on Mars to determine a rotation period of 24h 40m. This differs from the currently-accepted value by less <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes.</b> In 1672, Huygens noticed a fuzzy white cap at the north pole.|$|E

5|$|The Browns next {{beat the}} Los Angeles Dons 31–14 in Cleveland {{to extend their}} winning streak to seven games. The crowd of 71,134 people who {{attended}} the game on a sunny October day was a professional football record. Cleveland {{got off to a}} slow start, falling behind 7–3 at halftime. The Browns' only score in the first half came on a 49-yard Lou Groza field goal, then the fourth-longest kick in professional football history. A flurry of scoring {{at the end of the}} third quarter and in the fourth quarter, however, won Cleveland the game. Otto Graham passed 36 yards to end Dante Lavelli and then ran in a touchdown with less <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> left in the third. It was the first of four touchdowns in 14 minutes of play. Fullback Marion Motley ran in two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, one of them a 68-yard run that tied an AAFC record for a rush from scrimmage. The Browns won despite a strong ground attack by the Dons, who gained 274 yards of rushing. The Dons had 21 first downs compared to Cleveland's 10. Groza made all of his extra point attempts, extending his streak to 22 in a row.|$|E
5|$|The WAC preseason polls were {{released}} on October 29, and Louisiana Tech was predicted to finish {{sixth in the}} media poll and fifth in the coaches poll. Fellow senior Gibson {{was named to the}} preseason All-WAC second team, but Rolle was not honored by any preseason award. In the Bulldogs' home opener against Arkansas-Little Rock, Rolle was the leader in scoring with 23 points in crushing the Trojans 86–66. Gibson and Olu Ashaolu also scored more than 20 points to push Louisiana Tech to a 4–1 start, their best since 2001. Rolle's career high in points was 29, scored against Houston in a 99–94 defeat of the Cougars on December 29; Rolle also grabbed 10 boards. In the semifinal of the WAC tournament, against the #1 seeded Utah State Aggies, Rolle injured his ankle less <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> into the game, a factor in the Bulldogs' 30-point loss. They finished the regular season 23–10, including a 9–7 record in conference. That was good enough for an invitation to the 2010 CollegeInsider.com Tournament (CIT), in which Louisiana Tech defeated Southern Miss in the first round despite missing Rolle. In Rolle's final collegiate game, he contributed nine points off the bench despite a 69–40 rout of the Bulldogs by Missouri State in the CIT's quarterfinals.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2011 playoffs as {{the first}} seed in the West, the Canucks were matched against the Blackhawks for the third {{straight}} year. After opening the series with three straight wins, the Canucks lost the next three, forcing a seventh game. After he was pulled in favour of Schneider during Games 4 and 5 – having allowed six and four goals, respectively – Luongo started Game 6 on the bench. During the third period, Schneider suffered an injury, forcing Luongo to finish the game. He made 12 saves in relief of Schneider before Blackhawks forward Ben Smith scored in overtime. Although Schneider was available to play for Game 7, Vigneault chose to start Luongo. He made 31 saves in the deciding game, helping the Canucks to a 2–1 overtime win. His efforts included a cross-ice save on a one-timer from forward Patrick Sharp during a Blackhawks powerplay early on in the extra period. Going head-to-head against fellow Vezina Trophy nominee Pekka Rinne and the Nashville Predators in round two, Luongo kept Nashville to 11 goals over 6 games to help the Canucks advance. He maintained his performance in the Conference Finals against the San Jose Sharks, allowing 13 goals over 5 contests, including 54 saves in the fifth and deciding match, a game that went to double overtime. Luongo's efforts helped the Canucks reach the Stanley Cup Finals {{for the first time in}} 17 years. He opened the series against the Boston Bruins stopping all 36 shots in a 1–0 win for his third shutout of the post-season. As the series shifted to Boston's TD Garden with a two-games-to-none Canucks lead, Luongo surrendered eight goals in Game 3. The following contest, he was pulled for the third time in the playoffs after allowing 4 goals on 20 shots. Amidst heavy scrutiny from the media and Canucks fans, Luongo recovered for Game 5, stopping all 31 Bruins shots in a 1–0 win. It was his 15th win and 4th shutout of the post-season, tying both of Kirk McLean's single-year playoff team records, previously set in 1994. With an opportunity to clinch the Stanley Cup in Game 6, however, he was pulled again after allowing three goals in less <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> in the first period; the game ended in a 5–2 loss. Starting for the deciding seventh game, he allowed 3 goals on 20 shots, including one shorthanded goal, as the Canucks lost 4–0.|$|E
