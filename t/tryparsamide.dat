25|$|In 1924, he {{returned}} without his wife {{but with an}} Oxford undergraduate, Noel Gillespie, as assistant. Everything was heavily decayed, and building and doctoring progressed together for months. He now had salvarsan for treating syphilitic ulcers and framboesia. Additional medical staff, nurse (Miss) Kottmann and Dr. Victor Nessmann, joined him in 1924, and Dr. Mark Lauterberg in 1925; the growing hospital was manned by native orderlies. Later Dr. Trensz replaced Nessmann, and Martha Lauterberg and Hans Muggenstorm joined them. Joseph also returned. In 1925-6, new hospital buildings were constructed, and also a ward for white patients, so that the site became like a village. The onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems. Much of the building work was carried out {{with the help of}} local people and patients. Drug advances for sleeping sickness included Germanin and <b>tryparsamide.</b> Trensz conducted experiments showing that the non-amoebic strain of dysentery was caused by a paracholera vibrion (facultative anaerobic bacteria).

5000|$|The Rockefeller Institute sent Louise Pearce to L&eacute;opoldville in the Belgian Congo in 1920 to test <b>tryparsamide,</b> [...] "trusting her {{vigorous}} {{personality to}} carry out an assignment none too easy for a woman physician and not without its dangers". [...] There she worked with a local hospital and laboratory to design and carry out a drug testing protocol for human trials to establish tryparsamide's safety, effectiveness, and optimum dosage. Almost all early cases of the previously fatal disease were successfully treated, and most patients, even in the later stages of sleeping sickness, could be saved. Human trials also revealed that {{a side effect of}} other arsenical compounds, damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision, could occur with high or repeated doses of <b>tryparsamide.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1925, he {{encouraged}} use of <b>tryparsamide</b> to cure sleeping sickness. The drug {{was developed by}} Walter Abraham Jacobs, Michael Heidelberger, Louise Pearce, and Wade Hampton Brown of the Rockefeller Foundation and tested in the Belgian Congo in 1920 by Louise Pearce. Dr. Piper also established the areaâ€™s first leper treatment center in 1932 and the first tuberculosis treatment center in 1939.|$|E
50|$|Nonetheless, <b>tryparsamide</b> {{became the}} {{drug of choice}} for {{chemotherapy}} of sleeping sickness for several decades. The compound was able to enter the central nervous system, making it the first drug {{that could be used}} to treat later-stage sleeping sickness. It was easy to administer, acted quickly, and cured more than 80% of patients. Later research would show that it was most effective in one variant of the disease, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, less so in Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense.|$|E
50|$|Health care, too, {{was largely}} {{supported}} by the missions, although the colonial state took an increasing interest. Endemic diseases, such as sleeping sickness, were all but eliminated through large-scale and persistent campaigns. In 1925 medical missionary Dr. Arthur Lewis Piper {{was the first person}} to use and bring <b>tryparsamide,</b> the Rockefeller Foundation's drug to cure sleeping sickness, to the Congo. The health-care infrastructure expanded steadily throughout the colonial period, with a comparatively high availability of hospital beds relative to the population and with dispensaries set up in the most remote regions.|$|E
5000|$|Louise Pearce (March 5, 1885 [...] - [...] August 10, 1959) was an American {{pathologist}} at the Rockefeller Institute {{who helped}} develop {{a treatment for}} African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis). Sleeping sickness was a fatal epidemic which had devastated areas of Africa, killing two-thirds {{of the population of}} the Uganda protectorate between 1900 and 1906 alone. [...] With chemists Walter Abraham Jacobs and Michael Heidelberger and pathologist Wade Hampton Brown, Pearce worked to develop and test arsenic-based drugs for its treatment. In 1920, Louise Pearce traveled to the Belgian Congo where she designed and carried out a drug testing protocol for human trials to establish tryparsamide's safety, effectiveness, and optimum dosage. [...] <b>Tryparsamide</b> proved successful in combating the fatal epidemic, curing 80% of cases.|$|E
5000|$|After the United States {{declared}} war on Germany in April 1917, Heidelberger was commissioned in the Sanitary Corps and assigned to the Rockefeller Institute. He continued to work with Jacobs, a collaboration that lasted more than nine years and produced 44 papers. They synthesized many chemotherapeutical drugs, namely aromatic arsenicals, for the treatment for infectious diseases, in particular syphilis and African sleeping sickness. In 1919 they developed a variant of Paul Ehrlich's [...] "magic bullet" [...] for syphilis, Salvarsan, which proved effective against trypanosomes, the parasites that cause African sleeping sickness. Variants of <b>tryparsamide,</b> as Flexner named it, continue to be administered today. In 1953 the king of Belgium, colonial ruler of parts of Africa in which African sleeping sickness had been endemic, honored Heidelberger and Jacobs for their discovery.|$|E
5000|$|At the Rockefeller Institute, Simon Flexner {{organized}} {{a group to}} test arsenical compounds. Building {{on the work of}} Paul Ehrlich in Germany, who had developed an arsenic-derived drug called Salvarsan for the treatment for syphilis, chemist Walter A. Jacobs and immunologist Michael Heidelberger synthesized 243 possible arsenicals, varying methyl groups, amides, and complex side chains. [...] Pearce and Brown studied animal models of the disease in rats, mice, and rabbits, to better understand the course of the disease, and tested all the potential treatments to initially assess effectiveness. In mice and rats the parasites tended to remain in the bloodstream, while in rabbits they invaded the central nervous system, a more comparable model to what happened in humans. The most successful of the possibilities was <b>tryparsamide,</b> a derivative of atoxyl, in which a carboxyl group was converted into an amide to reduce toxicity of the drug. They announced successful results in the Journal of Experimental Medicine in 1919.|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Reese {{developed}} a {{particular interest in}} neurosyphilis, which, in the 1920s and 1930s, accounted for >10% of all psychiatric illnesses. In the days before effective antibiotic therapy of that disease, somewhat unconventional treatments were utilized. One of them involved the purposeful infection of patients with malarial organisms, {{with the goal of}} creating a fever. That technique followed the empiric observation that syphilis sometimes improved after febrile illnesses. Reese collaborated with investigators at other institutions using this approach, known as the [...] "Wagner-Jauregg" [...] treatment. Lorenz and Bleckwenn also focused on neurosyphilis with respect to their research endeavors, and, as the preeminent neurologist of the group, Reese was asked to evaluate the side-effects of experimental antisyphilitic drugs on nervous system function. The trio of physicians at Wisconsin went on to publish more than 100 papers on neurosyphilis; in particular, they {{developed a}}nd refined an alternative to Wagner-Jauregg therapy, using an arsenical medication called <b>tryparsamide.</b> Until the advent of penicillin in the 1940s, it was probably the most effective treatment for neurosyphilis available.|$|E
5000|$|Lorenz {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York in 1882, and {{received}} his M.D. from New York University School of Medicine in 1903. He took postgraduate training in neuropsychiatry at the Manhattan State Hospital in New York, and completed a fellowship in that discipline with Adolf Meyer in Illinois from 1908 to 1910. Lorenz joined the faculty {{in the department of}} neuropsychiatry at the University of Wisconsin Medical School in Madison, Wisconsin in 1910, and remained there {{for the rest of his}} career, except for a two-year leave of absence to serve in the military during World War I. He was a Professor of Neuropsychiatry and chief of the Wisconsin Psychiatric Institute in the late 1920s and 1930s. Lorenz is credited, along with William Bleckwenn, with developing the technique of sodium amytal-mediated disinhibition ("narcosynthesis" [...] or [...] "narcoanalysis"), which allowed psychiatrists to probe the minds of psychotic patients for diagnostic information. Along with colleagues, he also developed a relatively effective treatment for neurosyphilis using an arsenic compound called <b>tryparsamide.</b> Lorenz collaborated with physiologists and pharmacologists on methods to break catatonic mutism; these studies, which were sporadically but dramatically successful, used dilute intravenous solutions of sodium cyanide and the inhalation of carbon dioxide.|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>tryparsamide</b> in the {{treatment}} of trypanosomal infections by Pearce (1), and its use in {{the treatment}} of syphilis of the nervous system by Lorenz, Loevenhart, Bleckwenn and Hodges (2), has proven this drug to be of sufficient importance to warrant a study of its excretion. Pearce (1) reports cases of blindness following its administration and Lorenz, Loevenhart, Bleckwenn and Hodges report amblyopia following repeated doses of 5 grams and also in smaller doses (2). Lorenz, Loeven-hart, Reitz and Eck (3) report amblyopia following doses of 3 grams. Young and Loevenhart (4) showed that repeated large doses would produce changes in the rabbit retina, but the doses used were many times larger on a comparative basis than the clinical dose employed. Young and Hamilton (5) showed that {{at least part of the}} drug is excreted in the urine unchanged. Clinical experience shows that the first dose of <b>tryparsamide</b> rarely produces amblyopia or other toxic effects. In view of this fact, is it not possible, or even probable, that the interyal between doses is far more important from the toxicological standpoint than the size of the individual dose? If this be true, the thought presents itself that variation in the susceptibility of different individuals to repeated doses of <b>tryparsamide</b> may be an expression of different rates of excretion of the drug by them. With this idea in mind, we undertook a study of the rate of excretion of <b>tryparsamide</b> in the normal individual...|$|E
40|$|The natural form of blackhead, {{although}} very {{fatal to}} young turkeys, is favorably influenced by treatment with {{certain of the}} newer arsenical compounds. Neoarsphenamine injected intravenously in toxic doses has a somewhat favorable effect on {{the course of the}} spontaneous disease and evidently lowers the mortality. Its instability, its pronounced toxicity for young turkeys, as well as the difficulty of obtaining amounts suitable for the cases to be treated on any one occasion, serve to make its employment impracticable. Less favorable results were obtained with atoxyl. Arsenious acid fed daily in small doses failed to prevent blackhead and possibly increased the incidence of infection. In larger doses it failed to cure spontaneous blackhead. <b>Tryparsamide</b> may be injected in cases of spontaneous blackhead in doses as high as 1 gm. per kilo of body weight either intravenously or subcutaneously without serious toxic effect. Prompt clinical improvement usually follows and the mortality is undoubtedly greatly lowered. With inoculated blackhead recovery is more difficult to obtain. Birds treated by injections of either neoarsphenamine or atoxyl failed to recover. There were two recoveries among three tryparsamidetreated cases. An attempt to cure inoculated blackhead at an advanced stage by the injection of <b>tryparsamide</b> failed. The study of the lesions of treated turkeys shows that <b>tryparsamide,</b> and to some extent neoarsphenamine, have a more pronounced effect on the liver lesions than on the disease in the lung, which accounts for the discrepancy in the results of the treatment of spontaneous and inoculated blackhead. There is histological evidence of prompt absorption of necrotic liver parenchyma; moreover, the protozoa are destroyed more rapidly in the liver than in the lung. <b>Tryparsamide</b> has the most pronounced curative action on blackhead infection of any of the drugs thus far tested. Either intravenous or subcutaneous injection of appropriate doses of this drug at the first appearance of symptoms should serve to cure the majority of cases of blackhead...|$|E
40|$|<b>TRYPARSAMIDE,</b> {{the sodium}} salt of N-phenyl-glycine-amide-p-arsonic acid, was {{synthesized}} by Jacobs and. Heidelberger of the Rockefeller Institute (I 9 I 9) (I). Brown and Pearce (I 919) (2) studied it thoroughly from the toxicological and pharmacological standpoints, {{and it has been}} used extensively in the treatment of neuro-syphilis since its first trial by Lorenz, Loevenhart, Blackwenn and Hodges in I 922 and I 923 (3, 3 A). Despite the wide use of this compound and the massive dosage in which it is employed, its toxicity has been considered of relatively minor importance. Except for a moderate number of toxic amblyopias, exceedingly few untoward systemic reactions were previously encountered. Recently, however, numerous reports have appeared which tend to indicate that reactions to <b>tryparsamide</b> are increasing in frequency and severity (4). In order to gain an accurate estimate of our experience with the toxicology of this drug, we have reviewed the records of all patients treated with it in the Department of Dermatology and Syphilology of the University of Pennsylvania from I 930 to I 939 inclusive...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} of the action of <b>tryparsamide</b> in human trypanosomiasis concludes a series of {{chemical}} and biological investigations in a particular problem of chemotherapy and thus represents the final step in a logical method of approach to such a problem. It {{has been shown that}} <b>tryparsamide,</b> the sodium salt of N-phenylglycineamide-p-arsonic acid, possesses a marked trypanocidal activity in human trypanosomiasis caused by Tr. gambiense. Single doses of from 0. 5 to 5. 0 gm. produced a peripheral sterilization of lymph glands and blood in an average of 6 to 12 hours. The duration of the peripheral sterilization following single doses of 17 to 83 mg. per kilo ranged from 17 to 58 days in patients who ultimately showed a return of trypanosomes to the peripheral blood. In a number of patients, however, treated with single doses of 9 to 68 mg. per kilo, no such relapse was detected during an observation period of from 40 to 111 days. The drug is extremely soluble in water and may be administered intramuscularly as well as intravenously. The immediate trypanocidal action after intramuscular administration was as rapid as that following the intravenous route while the duration of peripheral sterilization was appreciably longer. Relatively few repeated doses produced in advanced cases a marked and rapid diminution of the cells of the spinal fluid and were associated with definite improvement of mental and nervous symptoms. The occurrence of visual disturbances in certain advanced cases was the only untoward effect detected {{during the course of the}} work, and was apparently related to a too frequent administration of the drug. The condition was transitory in the majority of instances and resumption of treatment was not followed by a recurrence of this symptom. The general beneficial effect of the drug was a noticeable feature of its action in both early and advanced cases as shown by the disappearance of subjective symptoms, by the return of the pulse and temperature to normal limits, by the pronounced improvement of the blood picture, and by well marked gains in weight...|$|E
40|$|Growth {{inhibition}} {{of the lower}} trypanosomatids Crithidia fasciculata and a Leptomonas from a hemipteron by several established trypanocides and leishmanicides were compared in four complex and one defined media. The Leptomonas was more susceptible than C. fasciculata in all media, especially to phenanthridines (ethidium, prothidium, isometamidium) and diamidines (pentamidine, diminazene diaceturate [Berenil], hydroxystilbamidine, stilbamidine); concentrations of these drugs required for 50 % {{inhibition of}} the Leptomonas were < 5 Î¼g/ml. In contrast, C. fasciculata was uninhibited by < 20 Î¼g of diamidines per ml and was three- to sixfold less susceptible than the Leptomonas to isometamidium and prothidium. Both trypanosomatids were susceptible to nucleoside antibiotics, e. g., nucleocidin. Neither was inhibited by suramin, melarsen, melarsen oxide, or <b>tryparsamide.</b> The Leptomonas was more susceptible to standard trypanocides than five other insect trypanosomatids in a complex medium; {{it was the only}} one inhibited by < 20 Î¼g of stilbamidine and hydroxystilbamidine per ml...|$|E
40|$|In 1937, as {{a result}} of the {{investigation}} of 458 cases (320 men and 138 women), Dr. Hutton and I brought to the notice of the Society three aspects of the problem of neurosyphilis (Nicol and Hutton). The first was the employment of ordinary antisyphilitic treatment (mainly the use of trivalent arsenicals) with its detrimental effect on the subsequent course of the disease. The investigation of this group made abundantly clear the importance and absolute necessity of performing a lumbar puncture in all late and latent cases with a persistent seropositive Wasser-mann reaction. The second aspect of neurosyphilis to be examined was the evidence of syphilis in partners and in the families of patients undergoing treatment; it was demonstrated that the amount of evidence of latent neurosyphilis was surprisingly great. Lastly, a glimpse into the future was taken; we advocated the use of malaria in preference to other forms of therapy, although it was agreed that in certain circumstances treatment with pentavalent arsenic, in the form of <b>tryparsamide,</b> provided efficient treatment. The importance of using malaria therapy or tryparsa-mide for the latent case of neurosyphilis, as a prophylactic against the subsequen...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (1) {{a new technique}} was described for investigating the penetration of an arsenical compound into the cerebrospinal fluid. The compound was administered to a pa-tient and after a suitable interval {{a sample of the}} cerebrospinal fluid was withdrawn; the trypanocidal power of this in vitro was measured as an indication of the probable therapeutic efficacy and a chemical estimation was made to shew the total amount of arsenic present. By this means it was found that after the in-travenous administration of <b>tryparsamide</b> or orsanine, the cere-brospinal fluid possessed considerable trypanocidal activity, while after the administration of other pentavalent compounds, or of trivalent compounds, such as neoarsphenamine, the activity was small or absent; there was no relationship between the extent of the trypanocidal activity and the total arsenic content of the fluid. The present paper describes investigations of further arsenic compounds by the same method; a series of cases was also examined after administration of the antimonial compound neostibosan. The technique was the same as that described in the previ-ous paper. Except where otherwise stated all compounds were given intravenously. The chemical estimations were made by â€˜Gillson Scholar of the Society of Apothecaries of London...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was carried out {{to determine the effects}} of <b>tryparsamide</b> upon the infections produced in various species of animals by Tr. rhodesiense. The strain of trypanosome used was one which possessed a very low virulence for guinea pigs, was fairly virulent for mice and rats, and highly virulent for rabbits. Therapeutic experiments carried out on 24 hour infections in mice and rats showed that cures could be obtained in this class of infections by the administration of a single large dose of the drug amounting to approximately two-thirds of the maximum tolerable dose, as contrasted with similar results in cases of gambiense infections from approximately one-ninth and one-fifth of this dose respectively. With advanced infections in rabbits, there appeared to be no single dose of the drug capable of insuring a cure which could be administered with safety, although some cures were obtainable with doses approximating the maximum tolerable dose. Treatment of these infections could be carried to a successful conclusion, however, by an intensive system of treatment in which large doses of the drug were administered at short intervals of time, and even relapses yielded to this treatment in some instances. The employment of such a method of treatment was possible on account of the unusual tolerance exhibited by animals to this drug, a fact which was previously emphasized...|$|E
40|$|The {{inability}} of the bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei brucei to decompose hydrogen peroxide forms {{the basis of our}} attempt to develop new pharmacological agents to kill these organisms. Approximately 1 - 3 % of the oxygen consumed by these parasites appears in the form of hydrogen peroxide. Our previous observation that free radical initiators such as heme and hematoporphyrin D proved to be trypanocidal in vitro and in vivo, respectively, prompted this investigation into the mechanism of action of this class of compounds to enhance their therapeutic efficacy. The locus of H 2 O 2 production within the trypanosome was examined using cell-free homogenates. Experiments described herein suggest that H 2 O 2 is formed by the alpha-glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase in an adventitious manner, and that no enzymatic means of disposing of this potentially toxic compound are present with the organisms. Naphthoquinones were found to substantially increase the rate of both oxygen consumption and H 2 O 2 production by trypanosomal mitochondrial preparations. Presumably, the naphthoquinones are acting as coenzyme Q analogues. The addition of sublytic concentrations of both naphthoquinones and heme leads to a synergistic lysis of the organisms in vitro. Another approach to increasing the susceptibility of T. b. brucei to free radical damage involved reduction of the intracellular concentration of glutathione. This was accomplished through the use of trypanocidal arsenicals. Melarsenoxide and heme acted synergistically in vitro, an effect which was further enhanced via addition of a naphthoquinone. Moreover, hematoporphyrin D and <b>tryparsamide</b> were shown to have a synergistic effect in T. b. brucei-infected mice...|$|E
