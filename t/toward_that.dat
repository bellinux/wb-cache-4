5|$|The bending of the Laplace {{plane of}} the Solar System <b>toward</b> <b>that</b> of Planet Nine's orbit can produce the {{apparent}} clustering of the longitude of the ascending nodes and arguments of perihelion of the extreme TNOs. The Laplace plane defines the center about which the pole of an object's orbit precesses with time. At larger semi-major axes the angular momentum of Planet Nine causes the Laplace plane to bend <b>toward</b> <b>that</b> of its orbit. As a result, when the poles of the eTNO orbit precess about the Laplace plane, they tend to remain {{on one side of}} the ecliptic pole. For objects with small inclination relative to Planet Nine, which were found to be more stable in simulations, this off-center precession resembles a libration of the longitudes of ascending nodes with respect to the ecliptic making them appear clustered. In combination with the anti-alignment of the longitudes of perihelion this can also produce clustering of the arguments of perihelion.|$|E
5|$|Although ecplised by Scots Baronial and Gothic forms, Neo-classicism {{continued}} to be a major style into the nineteenth century. William Henry Playfair (1790–1857) was the designer of many of Edinburgh's neoclassical landmarks in the New Town. Two of his finest works are the National Gallery of Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy, which are situated in the centre of Edinburgh. However, the figure most associated with the classical style was Alexander 'Greek' Thomson (1817–75). Working mainly in Glasgow, he turned away from the Gothic style <b>toward</b> <b>that</b> of the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, {{as can be seen in}} the temple and columns that were part of the Caledonia Road Church (1856).|$|E
5|$|Engelbart was Founder Emeritus of the Doug Engelbart Institute, {{which he}} founded in 1988 with his {{daughter}} Christina Engelbart, who is Executive Director. The Institute promotes Engelbart's philosophy for boosting Collective IQ—the concept of dramatically improving how we can solve important problems together—using a strategic bootstrapping approach for accelerating our progress <b>toward</b> <b>that</b> goal. In 2005, Engelbart received a National Science Foundation grant to fund the open source HyperScope project. The Hyperscope team built a browser component using Ajax and Dynamic HTML designed to replicate Augment's multiple viewing and jumping capabilities (linking within and across various documents).|$|E

5|$|Where society's need is great, {{no other}} {{effective}} means of meeting the need is available, and intrusion on people's privacy is minimal, certain discretionless checkpoints <b>toward</b> <b>that</b> end may briefly detain motorists. In United States v. Martinez-Fuerte (1976), the Supreme Court allowed discretionless immigration checkpoints. In Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz (1990), the Supreme Court allowed discretionless sobriety checkpoints. In Illinois v. Lidster (2004), the Supreme Court allowed focused informational checkpoints. However, in City of Indianapolis v. Edmond (2000), the Supreme Court ruled that discretionary checkpoints or general crime-fighting checkpoints are not allowed.|$|E
5|$|Based on his philanthropic worldview, Clinton {{created the}} William J. Clinton Foundation {{to address issues}} of global importance. This {{foundation}} includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and {{has worked with the}} Australian government <b>toward</b> <b>that</b> end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict. In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools. Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative. The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East. In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30percent in developing nations. Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has linked disgust sensitivity to {{negative attitudes toward}} gays and lesbians. We extend this existing research by examining {{the extent to which}} disgust sensitivity predicts attitudes more generally <b>toward</b> groups <b>that</b> threaten or uphold traditional sexual morality. In a sample of American adults (N = 236), disgust sensitivity (and particularly contamination disgust) predicted negative attitudes <b>toward</b> groups <b>that</b> threaten traditional sexual morality (e. g., pro-choice activists), and positive attitudes <b>toward</b> groups <b>that</b> uphold traditional sexual morality (e. g., Evangelical Christians). Further, disgust sensitivity was a weaker predictor of attitudes toward left-aligned and right-aligned groups whose objectives are unrelated to traditional sexual morality (e. g., gun-control/gun-rights activists). Together, {{these findings are consistent with}} a sexual conservatism account for understanding the relationship between disgust sensitivity and intergroup attitudes.

25|$|In June 1462, {{the army}} of the anti-Frederick {{alliance}} invaded the Electoral Palatinate with a force between 6,000 and 8,000 soldiers; they pillaged and burned property extensively. Their sources said that Frederick was not in his capital at Heidelberg, so the allied princes directed their army <b>toward</b> <b>that</b> place. Frederick was indeed at Heidelberg and he may have had spread reports to his absence in order to fool his enemies. Frederick rapidly massed 800 men-at-arms and 2,000 foot soldiers including Swiss mercenaries. Dieter arrived at the muster with 300 men-at-arms. In addition, many peasants also joined Frederick's army.|$|E
