50|$|A. J. Palumbo Center is a 4,406-seat {{multi-purpose}} {{arena in}} the Uptown area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania served by exits on both Interstate 376 and Interstate 579. The arena opened in 1988, and {{is part of}} Duquesne University. It {{is home to the}} Duquesne Dukes basketball, volleyball and wrestling programs. The center hosts concerts, boxing, and other special events, and is capable of converting the seating arrangement into a sport, stage, or <b>theatre</b> <b>setup.</b> The facility was named in honor of its benefactor, Antonio J. Palumbo, who was elected to the Duquesne University board of directors and, in 1987, received an honorary doctorate of Business and Administration from Duquesne. Performance Magazine, a concert trade magazine, has consistently ranked the Palumbo Center {{as one of the top}} 10 grossing arenas of its size since its opening in 1988.|$|E
50|$|The Kiama Showground is {{a sports}} and {{entertainment}} complex of the South Coast-Illawarra region in the coastal town of Kiama. The complex includes two ovals, the Showring and Chittick Oval. The showground is the host site of the Kiama Show which has operated {{for more than a}} hundred years. The show is held in late January each year (around Australia Day) and run by one of the five oldest Agricultural Show Societies in Australia. The showground's pavilion is the only community hall in Kiama. The pavilion and grandstand at the Kiama Showground has undergone a major re-development which was publicly opened by NSW governor Marie Bashir in August 2009. Kiama Showground is also the home ground to Group 7 Rugby League side, the Kiama Knights, a club where international players Shaun Timmins, Brett and Josh Morris learnt their trade. Kiama Rugby Union Club also plays its home games out of Kiama Showground. Kiama Touch Association also uses the ground for competition. As a part of Crown land, the surface is open to public, and many schools in the area also use the ground for sports events. The ground and pavilion are also used for various other concerts and special events. The pavilion itself can even be booked for corporate events, wedding receptions, conferences or other special functions, with facilities catering for 180 dining guests and a <b>theatre</b> <b>setup</b> for 330 people in the main Norfolk room. Smaller rooms, Saddlback room and Surf Beach room seat 80 people combined (or 40 each as separate rooms), as well as the Kendall room seating a further 35 patrons.|$|E

5000|$|While the {{technical}} {{principles of the}} camera obscura have been known since antiquity, the broad use of {{the technical}} concept in producing images with a linear perspective in paintings, maps, <b>theatre</b> <b>setups</b> and architectural and later photographic images and movies started in the Western Renaissance and the scientific revolution. While e.g. Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) had already observed an optical effect and developed {{a state of the}} art theory of the refraction of light, he was less interested to produce images with it (compare Hans Belting 2005); the society he lived in was even hostile (compare Aniconism in Islam) towards personal images. Western artists and philosophers used the Arab findings in new frameworks of epistemic relevance. [...] E.g. Leonardo da Vinci used the camera obscura as a model of the eye, René Descartes for eye and mind and John Locke started to use the camera obscura as a metaphor of human understanding per se. The modern use of the camera obscura as an epistemic machine had important side effects for science.|$|R

30|$|Centralised care {{of complex}} laparoscopic {{procedures}} offers {{the advantages of}} established advanced laparoscopic skills, advanced multidisciplinary care and an ideal <b>theatre</b> <b>setup.</b> It {{has been shown that}} the risk of complications in GLS is inversely proportionate to the experience of the operator [2]. The <b>theatre</b> <b>setup</b> and hospital structure must be capable of adapting to efficient practice of laparoscopic surgery. This keeps risks of complications to a minimum [3] and reduces cost [4]. It is thus reasonable to assume that established operators at minimal access surgery centres already have the experience and the setup to provide safe, specialised advanced laparoscopic surgery.|$|E
40|$|This book covers {{every aspect}} of humeral {{fractures}} from the proximal to the distal tip, including surgical and nonsurgical treatment, rehabilitation and more. Common fixation techniques are described {{with the help of}} high-quality illustrations. 16 The treatment of humeral fractures is a complex issue and the source of considerable controversy. In the case of fractures of the proximal humerus, early range of motion is the main aim of treatment. If a fracture modifies the anatomy or function of the glenohumeral and scapulothoracic joints, the surgeon must adhere meticulously to treatment principles in order to ensure a satisfactory outcome. Humeral shaft fractures are frequent, accounting for 1 % to 3 % of all fractures in adults; while excellent functional results have been reported with nonoperative management, open reduction and internal fixation is preferred in specific clinical settings. In contrast, intra-articular fractures of the distal humerus are frequently complex and full functional recovery is difficult to achieve. This volume clearly explains the concepts that are central to an understanding of humeral fractures from the proximal to the distal tip. Indications for different forms of treatment, including nonsurgica 16 l, are presented in detail, and all of the commonly used fixation techniques are described with the help of high-quality illustrations. Further important aspects such as complications, rehabilitation, and treatment of sequelae are also fully considered. This book will be an invaluable and comprehensive aid for all surgeons who treat humeral fractures. 04 PART 1 Proximal humerus: 1 Main anatomy. - 2 Understanding the Fracture. - 3 Operating <b>theatre</b> <b>setup.</b> - 4 Closed reduction principles. - 5 Surgical Approaches. - 6 Percutaneous fixation: when and how. - 7 ORIF in three-/four-part fractures. - 8 Intramedullary nail rationale and surgical technique. - 9 Anatomical shoulder arthroplasty. - 10 Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. - 11 Surgical neck fracture. - 12 The tuberosities. - 13 Malunions of the tuberosity. - 14 Nerve injuries. - 15 Fracture dislocations. - 16 Treatment of the sequelae. - 17 Conservative treatment. - PART 2 The diaphysis: 18 Surgical anatomy. - 19 Radial palsy and humerus fractures. - 20 Internal Fixation: plate or IM Nail. - 21 External fixation. - 22 Periprosthetic fracture. - PART 3 Distal Humerus: 23 Surgical anatomy. - 24 Surgical approaches and fracture pattern. - 25 Internal fixation principles. - 26 Prosthesis. - 27 External fixation when and how. - 28 Malunion and non union. - 29 Terrible triad. 13 From the book reviews:"This book represents an attractive concept in the age of information technology that allows easy Internet access to almost all data. [...] . This book is written for practitioners and residents who want detailed information on humeral fractures in general, or on a specific fracture. [...] . it is a potentially useful addition to an academic medical library that wants to be complete, and where the medical librarian identifies that medical personnel are using books as reference sources.
