25|$|In the 2002 election, {{incumbent}} Republican Governor John Engler was term-limited and {{not able}} to run for re-election to a fourth term in office. The Republicans unified around Engler's Lieutenant Governor, Dick Posthumus. Meanwhile, Granholm faced a competitive primary against former U.S. Ambassador to Canada and former Governor James Blanchard and U.S. Representative and former House Minority Whip David E. Bonior. Blanchard had been defeated for re-election by Engler in 1990 and Bonior had resigned as Democratic Whip to run for Governor, his House seat having been completely redrawn in redistricting <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> but unwinnable for him.|$|E
25|$|The Knicks {{were able}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> {{the way to}} the NBA finals during the 1969-70 NBA playoffs thanks to the great play of both Walt Frazier and star {{teammate}} Willis Reed. However, in game 5, Reed got a horrific leg injury, making him unable to walk for the next few days. With Reed out, chances of the Knicks winning the championship were slim. However, Reed somehow returned to the series, playing the first two minutes of game seven and scores the first two points of the game. Reed was simply in too much pain to continue to play for the last 46 minutes of the game, meaning that it was up to Frazier to lead New York to the victory. Frazier scored 36 points, had 19 assists, 7 rebounds, and 6 steals that game. His astounding performance is arguably the greatest game in NBA playoff history, as it was the only reason why New York was able to defeat the Lakers and win the championship. ESPN {{is one of the many}} websites to call Frazier’s incredible game the greatest game 7 performance ever.|$|E
500|$|At the age {{of fifteen}} and a half, Babcock was {{impressed}} at Perth Road by two recruiting officers, one a lieutenant and one a sergeant, who quoted from the poem [...] "The Charge of the Light Brigade". He was also enticed by the offered salary, which was $1.10 per day, {{as opposed to the}} 50 cents he could have made through physical labour. Babcock was recruited in Sydenham, Ontario and joined the 146th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He was then sent to Valcartier, Quebec. There Babcock underwent a physical, where it was discovered that he was underage. He was designated status A-4: physically fit, but underage. At the time, the minimum age for combat was eighteen. Babcock was turned down, but managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the way to Halifax by train before he was stopped by the company commander.|$|E

She was completely methodical; we had time-tables for each subject, and I had to do preparation, and so forth. She taught me to enjoy working hard, and to be thorough.

500|$|As {{the player}} {{progresses}} through the game, the perspective changes from Will's, to Sarah's, to Mary's {{and finally to}} Harry's. Players passively select whether they see Sarah's or Mary's story first through a hidden choice (which room they walk into first early in the game). It becomes apparent that the story is not only based on Will's life, but also those of other characters and how they cope with his death. During Sarah's portrayal she says [...] "Let me set the scene..." [...] and during {{this part of the}} game the player clicks on objects that slowly turn the setting into a pub. After a few pieces of dialogue, the player clicks again <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> disappear. During Harry's section, the player clicks on objects that remind Harry of Will. In some parts of the game, the player clicks on other characters to make them move forward, suggesting the idea of snapshots based on their memories. Once the player has clicked on enough objects, a meter becomes full and that triggers the next part of the game.|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, {{the track}} was {{released}} as the album's buzz single, {{not intended to}} be the first release of Raymond v. Raymond, but to generate reception and feedback. In March 2010, Usher continued to support Garrett's original claims, stating the song was recorded before his marriage ended. Usher said in an interview for MTV News for promoting Raymond v. Raymond: [...] "I think people would have immediately alluded to the fact I was talking about my wife when I made that record — and now my ex-wife," [...] he said. [...] "When the song was recorded, I wasn't divorced. It was some reality in the contrast of trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> work, having to balance a career and having a normal life. Coming in at 6 in the morning and arguing was a reality when you have those type of relationships. I felt that in a way, the story did touch on certain things at the time. I didn't know how realistic it would become. I didn't know I would become divorced. I did know it spoke on the contrast between trying to balance this world of being married and having this responsibility that's like a marriage at the same time. The song spoke to that place. Unfortunately, it did become a reality." ...|$|E

500|$|Usher toured {{fourteen}} {{cities in}} North America, coining the trip One Night Stand: Ladies Only Tour. Mainly targeting women, the tour commenced on November2,2008 and concluded on November25,2008. The tour's female-focused concept {{was inspired by}} other male recording artists who [...] "did things special like this for their female fans", such as Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye and Prince. Enjoying the challenge of a female-only tour, Usher said, [...] "There [...] only a few artists that can pull that off, I feel like I've had such a connection with my audience. This album, I felt like, was definitely the type of one that was more intimate. So {{what better way to}} get up close and personal than <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> women?" [...] Usher performed the tour with a Dsquared2 wardrobe. At each show, one fan was brought onstage [...] "for an even more intimate experience with the singer". This took place during [...] "Superstar"; a female fan was served champagne and strawberries by Usher while sitting on his lap as he sang to her. Among Usher's own songs, the setlist also included portions of Stevie Wonder's [...] "Rocket Love", Gaye's [...] "I Want You" [...] and Prince's [...] "Do Me, Baby". At the Detroit show he also gave T-Baby's [...] "It's So Cold in the D". Usher was supported by a five-piece band, three backing vocalists and four backup dancers.|$|E
500|$|Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times was {{disappointed}} with almost everything, {{and said the}} episode [...] "felt more like a long, slow letdown after a season of gleeful highs". She added, [...] "New Directions' sectionals performance wasn't a total fumble, but it wasn't the touchdown you might've hoped for either", and of the long-awaited opportunity to see other members featured in competition: [...] "the anticipated shining moment {{turned out to be}} so dull." [...] Reiter was one of a very few critics to note the absence of cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester in the episode, and only when she lamented the [...] "relative lack of humor". Futterman merely remarked on Sue's non-appearance in passing; she {{came to the conclusion that}} [...] "we got a spazzy, unfocused hour at the expense of emotional investment", and though Anthony Benigno of the Daily News complimented the [...] "solid acting", he also wrote that [...] "this is the first time the show's started to feel genuinely boring as opposed to, you know, gleeful." [...] He made a general complaint as well: [...] "This show is starting to suffer in a big way from making the music secondary to the plot." [...] Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10 rating. He said that the show [...] "tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> work, and while the hour was enjoyable enough, each storyline felt just a little bit shy of going from good to great." ...|$|E
500|$|Three days later, it was {{reported}} that Marvel was looking at Alan Taylor and Daniel Minahan as prospective directors to replace Jenkins, and were also in the midst of hiring a writer to rewrite Don Payne's script, with the shortlist of possible writers consisting of John Collee, Robert Rodat, and Roger Avary. At the end of the month, Alan Taylor, best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, was chosen to direct the sequel. Feige mentioned Taylor's work on the series Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones as reasons for his hiring, saying [...] "With Alan's direction we got a few more layers of patina, of texture, of reality into our golden realm." [...] By January 10, Marvel Studios had commissioned screenwriter Robert Rodat to rewrite the sequel and Hiddleston stated that filming was expected to begin in London in the summer of 2012. Hemsworth later confirmed that filming was scheduled to begin in August. Hemsworth also revealed that the film would have a more Viking-influenced feel, elaborating [...] "I think the science fiction element to Thor… the danger is it falls a little bit into the world of it's 'tough to throw a light to.' I think of big waterfalls and mountains and a Viking influence, where the Norse mythology kind of grew from. Having that in Asgard is going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the more special and that's what Alan [...] wants to bring to it." [...] Feige said [...] "while the relationship between Loki and Thor certainly has changed [...] and has progressed, a lot of Thor 2 is picking up where it left off in terms of Jane, who you just saw for a moment on a computer monitor, and also what's been going on in the nine realms without the Asgardians being able to use the Bifrost." [...] Feige also said that while Loki has a part, [...] "there will be a different villain, another big villain".|$|E

2500|$|Also {{early in}} 1985, the group began using a {{thermostable}} DNA polymerase (the enzyme {{used in the}} original reaction is destroyed at each heating step). [...] At the time only two had been described, from Taq and Bst. [...] The report on Taq polymerase was more detailed, so it was chosen for testing. [...] The Bst polymerase was later found to be unsuitable for PCR.

[...] In the Fall of 1985 Susanne Stoffel and David Gelfand at Cetus succeed in making the polymerase, and it was immediately found by Randy Saiki to support the PCR process.|$|E

500|$|In Mojos The Beatles' Final Years Special Edition (2003), Peter Doggett {{acknowledged}} the comparative rarity of [...] "It's All Too Much" [...] within the Beatles canon and added: [...] "Yet it's {{one of the}} pinnacles of British acid-rock, its sleepwalking rhythm retaining a bizarrely contemporary feel today." [...] Having included the track in his 2011 list of Harrison's [...] "10 Greatest Beatles Songs", Joe Bosso of MusicRadar commented: [...] "At times the song seems to drift away with Harrison's dreamy verses, but just as quickly it's chopping down trees with explosive percussion and thunderous handclaps. Wild guitar breaks by both Harrison and John Lennon help <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>It's</b> <b>All</b> Too Much a dizzying treat." ...|$|R
2500|$|Goddard {{said that}} {{although}} the album came together easily, the band had difficulty creating [...] "Hand Me Down Your Love" [...] because [...] "it {{was just a matter}} of months and months of adding synthesizers, [...] adding drum parts", which resulted in [...] "something like 160 tracks or pieces of music". As well as this, the band needed to edit out sections that they felt were unnecessary. Goddard discussed the element of time and stated that because the band had more time to create the album, they [...] "tried things out differently" [...] which was ultimately [...] "a little bit unhelpful" [...] due to the number of recorded parts that were never used. Goddard said the band wanted to move away from synths and minimised their presence by making them more subtle. Although the band wanted the album to be a pop record and present [...] "a unified front", Al Doyle stated that the band did not want to lose the [...] "experimental element that [...] had before". To achieve this the band used a broader range of instruments, including a flugelhorn and steelpans in combination with synths and drum machines, as well as a guitar, a drum kit and a piano. Doyle said it was [...] "quite exciting for [...] to work with that palette of instruments". Whilst the band wanted to create an album that was more cohesive, Taylor said that they did not [...] "try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> sound like [...] from the same record". The cohesiveness and unity of the album was a by-product of the way the band spent their time crafting it: ...|$|E
