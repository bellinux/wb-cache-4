We got more work than we could travel away, but the thing took {{on a life of its}} own. <b>The</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> the Falcons, we never {{actually}} changed our style that much. We just accumulated new ones. It turned into a stratified thing 'cause we were mixing everything together all the way through. There was no plan. – John Power.|$|E

I've learned more from the songs than I've learned from any {{of this kind of}} entity. The songs are my lexicon. I believe the songs.|$|E

500|$|The {{documentary}} crew put wireless microphones {{on several}} of the actors and crew and followed them through the conception, pre-production, filming, editing, screening and reception of [...] "Subway". Many people involved with the show found the process extremely disruptive. In particular, Fleder said that he hates to be photographed and found the camera crew distracting and stressful. Fleder, who agreed to interviews for the documentary but refused to wear a microphone on the set, said of the crew, [...] "To pull off a show like this, a seven-day shoot with this much dialogue and this many shots per day, {{you have to be}} really, really focused, and for me <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> the documentary crew kept pulling away from the focus." ...|$|E
500|$|Homer's {{nightmare}} {{is based}} on much of the film Frankenstein, and the end references <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>with</b> Two Heads. While Mr. Burns scoops out Homer's brain, he hums the tune of [...] "If I Only Had a Brain" [...] which is sung by the Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz. Burns also calls the robot that had Homer's brain a [...] "clinking, clattering cacophony of caliginous cogs and camshafts", similar to the Wizard's line to the Tin Man: [...] "You clinking, clanking, clattering collection of caliginous junk!" [...] In Homer's nightmare, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson is broadcast on a TV. When Mr. Burns puts on Homer's brain, he says [...] "Look at me!

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jeff Martin, George Meyer, Sam Simon and John Swartzwelder while Jim Reardon was the director. The episode is {{presented}} in a similar format to the previous season's [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] and contains several similarities to the previous episode, such as Marge's opening warning, the tombstones in the opening credits {{and the appearance of}} the alien characters Kang and Kodos. [...] "Treehouse of Horror II" [...] was the first episode that employed the [...] "scary names" [...] idea, in which many of the credits have unusual names. The episode contains numerous parodies and references to horror and science fiction works, including The Twilight Zone, Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>with</b> Two Heads and Invasion of the Body Snatchers.|$|E
500|$|Digital Spys Ben Rawson-Jones {{described}} the episode's stand-off between Mulder and Scully as [...] "an extremely tense moment of paranoia." [...] A New York Daily News review called the episode [...] "potent and creepy", {{and said that}} its plot [...] "was worthy of honorary passage into The Twilight Zone". Matt Haigh called it [...] "an extremely absorbing and thrilling episode" [...] on the Den of Geek website, noting its debt to The Thing, and Juliette Harrisson called [...] "Ice" [...] the [...] "finest" [...] stand-alone episode of the first season. On the TV Squad blog, Anna Johns called it [...] "a spectacular episode" [...] with an [...] "excellent" [...] opening. UGO Networks called the episode's worms among the series' best [...] "Monsters-of-the-Week" [...] {{and the cause of}} [...] "much pointed-guns aggression". In Tor.com, Meghan Deans compared the scene where Mulder and Scully inspect each other for infection to a similar scene in [...] "Pilot"; in [...] "Ice", both characters were equally vulnerable and (unlike the pilot scene) Scully was not portrayed as [...] "an idiot". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode five out of five stars. They called it [...] "the most influential episode ever made", noting that the series reprised its formula several times during its run. Shearman felt that although their script was derivative, Morgan and Wong created [...] "a pivotal story" [...] by combining crucial themes from <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>with</b> a [...] "well rounded" [...] cast of characters.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2010, Clarkesworld Magazine {{published}} [...] "The Things", a {{short story}} by Peter Watts which retells the film events from the alien's {{point of view and}} paints it in a much more sympathetic light by describing the Thing as an alien with an innocent impulse to share with the human race its power of communion and its frightened, not to mention severely saddened, reaction when they attack it. The story received a nomination to the Hugo Award in 2011. The Thing Itself (2015), a novel by British author Adam Roberts, remixes <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>with</b> Kantian philosophy.|$|E

2500|$|... "Dark layers", and a nuanced {{personality}} of [...] "many different levels and shades" [...] attracted Akingbola to the role. Malick has a violent streak, and is introduced after hitting his former boss, though he becomes calmer with time. A February 2011 episode saw his composure {{threatened by a}} racist patient. Akingbola appreciated the storyline for highlighting the continuation of racism and prejudice: [...] "In this country, we can feel like there's no racism and it's like a lovely Benetton advert but it's still there – that's the truth." [...] He characterised Malick as [...] "not all bad", capable of becoming [...] "a nice guy", and expanded: [...] "I think <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> Malick is that he's young, confident and he speaks from the heart. He wears his heart on his sleeve, and I don't think there's many people like that on the ward! He doesn't care if what he says offends people, because that's what he believes. But he becomes a bit more sensitive." [...] Akingbola anticipated many [...] "twists and turns" [...] in Malick's storylines. He described him as having many secrets, and being a closed off person who [...] "keeps his cards very close to his chest." [...] Using the simile of an onion, he asserted that Malick's layers would be peeled back slowly, to reveal his [...] "wonderful heart".|$|E
