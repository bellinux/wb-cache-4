25|$|The {{mid-nineteenth century}} saw the {{beginnings}} of formal public parks. Designers included Joseph Paxton (1803–65), who developed Kelvingrove Park and Queen's Park in Glasgow and <b>the</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Park,</b> Dumfirmline. James Whitton became director of public parks in Glasgow and {{played a leading role}} in the development of parks towards the end of the century. The mild climate and soils of western Scotland facilitated the creation of special plantsman's gardens at Crarae, Arduaine and Younger Botanic Garden in Argyllshire and at Inverewe, Sutherland and Logan Botanic Garden, Wigtownshire.|$|E
25|$|When Norman Foster, in {{collaboration}} with the Danish landscape architect Stig L. Andersson, designed the new Elephant House for the adjacent Copenhagen Zoo, it was done as an extension of Frederiksberg Gardens. A three-metre high wall that once separated the two {{has been replaced by a}} simple fence, so that visitors to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>park</b> can now watch the elephants, while affording the elephants distant views as well. The enclosure steps up slowly away from the park, rising to the height of the domes. From a distance, these appear to be buried in the ground, surrounded by ferns and trees.|$|E
25|$|Also of note is Avery Hill Park and {{its former}} mansion, {{accessed}} from Bexley Road and {{at various points}} along the three miles (5km) of other streets that surround the park.

It consists of numerous lengthy walking and cycling trails along Four Pole Creek, which runs {{the entire length of}} the park and is crossed by many wooden and stone footbridges.There are also restroom facilities, picnic tables, a shelter with grills and electrical outlets, a children's playground, an amphitheater for small concerts and plays, an award-winning rose garden, and a new dog park.|$|E
25|$|The {{cemetery}} {{was closed}} for burials in 1893 and its maintenance given over to the British consulate. Over the following half-century {{what was once a}} romantic memory of the bourgeoisie of 18th-century Naples was scandalously allowed to fall into disrepair. Statues were vandalized and stolen and the entire cemetery became overgrown with weeds and vegetation. At the end of the 1950s the cemetery was donated to the Commune of Naples and a plan was drawn up for the re-utilization of the area. This foresaw the conversion of the cemetery into a public park, retaining some of the memorials as a reminder {{of the history of the}} cemetery and those interred in it. However, while most of the remaining land area of the cemetery was retained, only a fraction of the memorials were renovated and preserved, and the original ambience was almost obliterated in the construction of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>park.</b>|$|E

500|$|Royal Victoria Park, a {{short walk}} from the city centre, was opened in 1830 by the 11-year-old Princess Victoria, and was the first park to carry her name. <b>The</b> <b>public</b> <b>park</b> is {{overlooked}} by the Royal Crescent and covers [...] It has a skatepark, tennis courts, a bowling green, a putting green and a 12- and 18-hole golf course, a pond, open-air concerts, an annual travelling funfair at Easter, and a children's play area. Much of its area is lawn; a notable feature is a ha-ha that segregates it from the Royal Crescent while giving the impression from the Crescent of uninterrupted grassland across the park to Royal Avenue. It has a [...] "Green Flag Award", the national standard for parks and green spaces in England and Wales, and is registered by English Heritage as of National Historic Importance. The [...] botanical gardens were formed in 1887 and contain one of the finest collections of plants on limestone in the West Country.

The negative relationship between the persons visiting <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> and <b>the</b> WTP, revealed from the multivariate analysis indicates that, non-use value of <b>public</b> <b>parks</b> in Nagasaki City is also very high.

2500|$|City {{officials}} {{approved the}} final master plan on November 20, 2006.

Twenty percent of the condominiums would be priced for low-income people. <b>The</b> <b>public</b> <b>park</b> had not disappeared (as previously reported), but just [...] were set aside for what was now called [...] "Central Plaza". Tenth Street NW was reopened, a narrowed I Street NW was reopened between 9th and 10th Streets NW, and 30 percent of the retail space was set aside for non-chain stores. Two condominium buildings occupied the corner of 9th and H Streets NW, while two larger apartment buildings occupied the corner of 10th and H Streets NW. A north-south running open-air plaza occupied the space between them. Two office buildings occupied {{the south end of}} the block between 10th and 11th Streets NW, while an open-air public park with fountain was on the north end. A [...] wide, covered [...] "pedestrian street" [...] ran east-west between the buildings on both blocks. Foster and Partners oversaw the design of the development, while the local firm of Shalom Baranes Associates was the lead architect. The Washington Business Journal and Washington Times reported the project's total cost as $650 million, but the Washington Post pegged it at $630 million. City officials estimated that the development would create more than 7,500 temporary construction jobs and 5,200 permanent jobs, and bring in $30 million annually in income, sales, and property tax revenues. Construction was set to begin in late 2008 and conclude by mid-2011. The city had yet to decide what to do with its remaining [...] parcel, which occupied the west end of the triangular block bordering New York Avenue NW between 9th and 10th Streets NW, but city officials were still pushing for a public library on the spot.|$|E
2500|$|Less {{than two}} weeks before the {{proposed}} move date, NUCC requested that Woodinville once again provide <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>park</b> property for use by TC4 for a period of 60 days. If the city was unwilling, the church publicly announced a plan to relocate on church property for 90 days without further permit procedures. The city council declined to make the park available and informed the church that it would face a full legal response and code enforcement effort if it went ahead with the move. [...] Despite these warnings, NUCC allowed TC4 to relocate to church property on May 13. The city filed a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order with King County Superior Court on May 12, which was denied by Judge Palmer Robinson after reviewing the city's briefing and hearing oral argument. Instead the judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing the city from taking code enforcement action until a May 24 hearing, thus allowing TC4 to move onto church property, subject to certain conditions. [...] Woodinville filed for injunctive relief, breach of contract, and collection of damages with the King County Superior Court. [...] On May 30, Judge Charles Mertel ordered the sides to mediation to be conducted daily while the case was being heard. [...] This mediation failed to result in a settlement. The city also sought financial restitution for private and public security costs. On June 9, Judge Mertel ruled the encampment and church were in violation of their 2004 agreement with the city and ordered the encampment to vacate the site by midnight June 17. On June 13, NUCC and SHARE/WHEEL filed an appeal with the state Court of Appeals arguing that the city's land use code is an unconstitutional infringement upon the church's religious expression, that the church did not violate the 2004 agreement between the church and city, and that the church was denied its constitutional right to a trial by jury. [...] On June 16 the Washington State Court of Appeals issued a stay of the trial court's decision pending the resolution of the appeal. The City appealed the stay, but the stay was affirmed by a full panel of appellate judges. [...] The City's request for attorney fees was subsequently denied by Judge Mertel. Additionally, a Northeast District Judge in Redmond dismissed 28 misdemeanor citations from the city against a SHARE/WHEEL employee by ruling that the city was [...] "without authority" [...] to issue the citations. On February 26, 2007, Judge David Steiner ordered Woodinville to pay the $8,388 in attorneys' fees needed to defend the SHARE employee.|$|E
