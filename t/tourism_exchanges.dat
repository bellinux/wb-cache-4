40|$|Rapid {{decolonization}} {{began after}} World War II (1939 – 1945) {{and did not}} conclude until {{the breakup of the}} former USSR in 1989. Many studies have labelled tourism as the peace industry. However, there have been limited efforts to analyze post-colonial <b>tourism</b> <b>exchanges</b> between colonizers and the colonized. This study explored the development of post-colonial <b>tourism</b> <b>exchanges</b> between Japan and South Korea in the period 1946 – 2010. The high level of residual mistrust and diplomatic disputes that affected bilateral flows in the years after Korea's independence from Japan have now been replaced by a very high level of bilateral flows between the two nations, indicating that many of the issues of the past are no longer seen as relevant by contemporary Korean and Japanese tourists. The paper suggests a framework for analysing post-colonial flows. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Tourism {{is largely}} {{concerned}} with considerations of being, meaning and identity. However despite some definite fracturing of the powerbases of the tourism academy, its gatekeepers of knowledge remain dominated {{by those who}} prefer the comfort of conventional scientific objectivities, and much tourism research still adheres to positivistic and scientific principles and approaches in its attempts to trace {{the ways in which}} human meaning is created in <b>tourism</b> <b>exchanges.</b> Here I advocate the further development and application of research methodologies and programmes which foreground the ‘situated researcher’, encourage active participant involvement and create reflexivity, contending that such approaches can offer unique insights into the meanings people ascribe to experiences, practices and performances. Drawing on my study of tourist-brand relationships, I illustrate the capacity which reflexive and participant-led research programmes using methods (auto-ethnography and narrative interpretation), and participatory and sensory devices (auto-driving, photo-elicitation and visual texts) have to fathom the complex and often hidden symbolic meanings of the tourist experience...|$|E

40|$|This paper forms {{part of an}} {{endeavour}} {{to elicit}} the cultural-geo-politics of rapprochement tourism between China and Taiwan from a grounded approach. It seeks to examine cross-strait tourists' travel experiences on 'the other side' {{through the lens of}} 'border', 'materiality' and 'identity' in an attempt to move beyond the often state-centric analyses of cross-strait ties. Discussion shows that travel documents that are close to the personal or those that are part and parcel of a touring experience are far from inert; they participate in the social and political lives of their owners, feature in bordering practices between the Chinese and the Taiwanese, and are often platforms through which identities are performed. Importantly too, as the various travel narratives reveal, the ubiquitous border certainly does not exist only in its physical form; imagined and perceived social borders are equally potent in (re) shaping cross-strait relations. A study that captures the often neglected field of comparative tourists' travel experiences is timely in the advent of a warming relationship between China and Taiwan and the unprecedented increase in <b>tourism</b> <b>exchanges</b> that ensues. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{cultural}} interaction between communities and visitors to islands using social exchange theory to enhance the understanding of the island experience. Design/methodology/approach - The method consisted of 30 in-depth interviews with community and tourism stakeholders, and formed part of a multi-phase study that used social exchange theory as the lens to illuminate a range of perspectives of island interaction. This paper presents a comparative case study of Bruny Island in Tasmania, and Magnetic Island in Queensland, Australia. Findings - Findings revealed that local community members have a wide range of motivations for entering into social exchanges with visitors, ranging from solely economic, to a genuine desire to provide quality experiences. Additionally, findings showed the nature of island cultural interaction could vary immensely, from welcoming and meaningful exchanges through to superficial and even hostile contact. Research limitations/implications - As this research is on two islands in Australia, within a particular timeframe, the results may not be representative of island communities generally. Nonetheless, the results are indicative of locals 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of their interactions with visitors. Practical implications - The findings have a range of practical implications for the management of local and visitor interaction on islands. A key implication for island communities is the importance of developing programs that educate and inform locals about the potential benefits of interaction. Additionally, this research illustrates how islands can use cultural interaction to differentiate their tourism product and market island experiences. Originality/value - The paper 2 ̆ 7 s contribution is its use of social exchange theory at a micro-level to illuminate a range of local community members 2 ̆ 7 perspectives of their <b>tourism</b> <b>exchanges,</b> in order to enhance understanding of the complex process of interaction between locals and visitors to islands...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the effect of the exchange rate arrangements on international tourism. The ambiguity of literature about the effect of exchange rate volatility contrasts with the magnitude of the impact of a common currency on trade. On the basis of a gravity equation we estimate a moderate effect of a currency union on tourism of almost 12 %. Furthermore, we estimate a gravity equation for international trade, obtaining that the common currency effect on trade is reduced when tourism is introduced as a regressor. This suggests that tourism flows may contribute to explain the excessive magnitude of the estimated effect of a common currency on trade in this literature. Finally, we analyze the impact of several de facto exchange rate arrangements on tourism, finding that less flexible <b>exchange</b> rates promotes <b>tourism</b> flows. <b>Tourism,</b> <b>Exchange</b> Rate Regime, Common Currency...|$|R

A unidirectional causality is noted from tourism to output per worker; from exchange rate to output per worker and capital per worker; and from output to capital, in per worker terms.

40|$|The project {{aimed at}} the {{following}} goals: (1) to provide experts in the tourism industry with ideas on how concrete tourism-related environmental problems can be resolved, based on best-practice examples; (2) to better familiarise environmental technology producers with the specific areas of possible environmental technology use and, in this manner, to promote among other things the realisation of the vast market potential; (3) to highlight possibilities for co-operation between the tourism industry and environmental technology producers and/or transfer institutions; and (4) to provide tourism industry experts with knowledge on how the domestic and foreign use of environmental technology is steered and promoted {{within the framework of}} tourism, environmental and technology policy. In order to achieve these aims, an international expert conference on 'Environmental Technology and Tourism' was held in March 1998 {{in the run-up to the}} International <b>Tourism</b> <b>Exchange</b> in Berlin.
