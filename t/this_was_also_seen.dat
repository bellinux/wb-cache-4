25|$|After {{a further}} summer of exploration, the {{expedition}} returned to North America on June 18, 1930. A 19-year-old American Boy Scout, Paul Allman Siple, {{was chosen to}} accompany the expedition. Unlike the 1926 flight, this expedition was honored with the gold medal of the American Geographical Society. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> in the film With Byrd at the South Pole (1930) which covered his trip there.|$|E
25|$|One {{issue that}} sparked {{tensions}} between France and Canada began {{shortly after the}} creation of la Francophonie, an international organization of wholly and partially French-speaking countries modeled somewhat after the Commonwealth of Nations. While Canada agreed in principle to the organization's creation, it was dismayed by France's position that not only should Quebec participate as an equal, independent member, but {{that the federal government}} and (by omission) the other provinces with significant French minorities could not. This was seen by many French-Canadians outside of Quebec as a betrayal. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> by some Canadians as France supporting the Quebec sovereignty movement. Some go as far as saying the Francophonie was created to help push the international recognition of Quebec, but in reality the Francophonie was created to promote international cooperation between all French speaking nations, including many newly independent former French colonies in Africa.|$|E

500|$|Unloading of Fort Stikine {{began with}} the {{lubricating}} oil, followed by the fish manure. An extra gang of stevedores were employed on this task, which continued through the night of 13–14 April. At midday on 13 April, lighters arrived for the explosives. Minor engine repairs also started at that time, rendering the ship unable to move under her own power. At 12:30, the Chief Officer of [...] noticed smoke issuing from the ventilators of the № 2 hold of Fort Stikine. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> {{a short time later}} by a DEMS gunner on board [...] Despite being seen by these (and other) witnesses, everyone assumed that the situation was under control. The alarm was not raised until 13:45. The fire pump in the ship's engine room was started and the firefighting operation began.|$|E
500|$|In April and May that year, some European-Americans in Texas {{wrote to}} the editor of the Brazosport Facts {{questioning}} the fuss over her death; some were offended because Selena Day coincided with Easter Sunday. Others said, [...] "Easter is more important than Selena Day", and believed people should let Selena rest in peace and get on with their lives. Mexican-Americans living in Texas also {{wrote to the}} newspaper; some agreed that others were too critical of Selena Day, stating they did not need to celebrate the day and should not have responded to its announcement so rudely. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> by the Corpus Christi Caller Times, which said it had printed several of the negative comments left by people and that many comments were [...] "unprintable". Latino filmmaker Lourdes Portillo said she did not know who Selena was when she heard about the shooting.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2008, the Pirates {{became the}} first MLB team to sign Indian players when they {{acquired}} the non-draft free agents of Rinku Singh and Dinesh Patel. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> by Pirates general manager Neal Huntington, as [...] "not only add two prospects to our system but also hope to open a pathway to an untapped market." ...|$|E

5000|$|Smarties: a bean-sized, small candy covered chocolate, {{similar to}} plain M&M's. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> in British English.

50|$|Fossils {{have shown}} that Gerrothorax was pedomorphic, {{retaining}} its larval gills as an adult. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> in some modern-day salamanders, such as the mudpuppy, the axolotl, and the olm. Gerrothorax had three pairs of external gills allowing it to breathe under water.|$|R
50|$|Today, game soundtracks {{are sold}} on CD, {{as well on}} {{digitally}} on websites such as iTunes.

50|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> in the {{way they}} are used.

500|$|Seychellum alluaudi is {{the only}} truly {{freshwater}} crab in the Seychelles; all the other true crabs in the islands have marine larvae.

50|$|The {{genesis of}} the bucket lake in Eckernförde is unique: a {{polythene}} bucket (hence the name) {{was used as a}} plug in a pipe in 1990. Since then, the lake has become a habitat with a huge diversity of plants and animals. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> as a successful example of cheap land restoration in Japan, in South Korea and in the United States.|$|E
50|$|The flag is {{a symbol}} of Gibraltarian nationalism, and is very popular among Gibraltarians.

50|$|The Argentine {{economic}} crisis of 2001 {{was in part}} the result of massive capital flight, induced by fears that Argentina would default on its external debt (the situation was made worse {{by the fact that}} Argentina had an artificially low fixed exchange rate and was dependent on large levels of reserve currency). <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> in Venezuela in the early 1980s with one year's total export income leaving through illegal capital flight.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} the beta {{movement}} effect would be a set of LEDs, as shown at {{the picture on the}} right.

50|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> in {{the earlier}} PhONEday areas, such as in Sheffield, for (0114) 2xx xxxx numbers, where these are often seen written as 01142 xxxxxx or are missing the leading digit 2 when {{abbreviated}} (751234 instead of 275 1234 for example). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> a particular problem now that (0114) 3xx xxxx local numbers are being issued.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of this movement, several {{cultural}} works, including many identified above, were considered elements of [...] "new sincerity", but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> to be a mannerism adopted by the general public, to show appreciation for cultural works that they happened to enjoy. Andrew Watercutter of Wired saw this as having being able to enjoy one's guilty pleasures without having to feel guilty about enjoying it, and being able to share that appreciation with others.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{before the}} merger that created ICL was complete, a working party had {{recommended}} that the new company should develop a new range of machines offering [...] "acceptable compatibility with the current ranges of both companies". <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>seen</b> {{as a way to}} help [...] "achieve company unity" [...] for the newly formed organization. The resulting 2900 Series was launched on 9 October 1974. Its design drew on many sources, one being the Manchester University MU5.|$|E
50|$|Denim and Leather is {{the fourth}} studio album by English heavy metal band Saxon {{released}} in 1981.
