2500|$|Before the {{wireless}} station at Kamina was destroyed, [...] were passed between Germany, {{the navy and}} colonies following the outbreak of war. The first military operations of British soldiers during the First World War occurred in Togoland and ended soon after British operations began in continental Europe. In December 1916, the colony was split into British and French occupation zones, which cut through administrative divisions and civilian boundaries. Both powers sought a new partition and in 1919, Article 22 of the Treaty of Versailles partitioned former German colonies between the Allies. In July 1922, British Togoland and French Togoland were created from former German Togoland, as League of Nations mandates. The French acquisition consisted of about {{sixty percent of the}} colony, including the coast. The British received the smaller, less populated and less developed portion of Togoland, to the west. The part administered by the British, united with Ghana upon its independence in 1957; French Togoland gained independence in 1960, becoming the modern <b>Togolese</b> <b>Republic.</b> The surrender of Togoland {{marked the beginning of the}} end for the German colonial empire, which lost all of its African and Pacific possessions.|$|R
50|$|Just {{days before}} the end of the 2010 African Cup in Angola, Issa Hayatou found himself in the middle of a {{controversy}} after the CAF's suspension of Togo national football team from the next two African Cup of Nations.

The Togolese team was victim of an 8 January 2010 armed attack while travelling to Angola by bus prior to the start of the Cup, resulting in two deaths in the <b>Togo</b> delegation. <b>Togolese</b> captain Emmanuel Adebayor and Togo coach Hubert Velud strongly criticised Hayatou in particular for the CAF decision, calling on him to resign from the CAF presidency.|$|R

5000|$|Children born in <b>Togo</b> or to <b>Togolese</b> fathers {{automatically}} become {{citizens of}} Togo. In {{cases where the}} father is unknown or is stateless, children inherit their mothers' citizenship. Children are required to attend school until age 15, but parents must pay for books and cover other expenses. Child abuse is common, and the law against child sexual exploitation and child prostitution is not well-enforced. Statutory rape is not illegal. There is a degree of child marriage, especially among Muslims. A 2007 law guarantees {{a wide range of}} protections for children, and in 2009 the government set up a toll-free line to report child abuse. But the government does little to help orphans and other children in need. Togo is not a signatory of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.|$|R
40|$|Witnessed {{the last}} hundred years {{profound}} political and constitutional changes. In this respect there are many differences between African States depending on which kind of colonial overlord has been the ruling power. The African State was a juridical entity in international law, but was it also, at the time of independence, an empirical entity in national fact?In almost all cases the empirical reality as a functioning government was still primarily the presence of European bureaucrats who has embodied the colonial state. Independence therefore opened a gap between the international legitimacy and the internal marginality of many emergent African State. The gap often presented a real political dilemma to the new African rulers: they usually could retain European officials only by compromising their national independence and could dispense with them only at the risk of undermining governmental performance. After adoption of European constitutional law and with, initially, a high degree of similarity between most constitutions in French-speaking Africa, nowadays these constitutions differ widely, contrary to the Commonwealth Africa that has experienced fewer innovations and constitutional breakdowns. Parliamentary systems of government gave way to One Party Systems, introduced in many cases by the national army, as the best equiped, trained, paid and organised power in the country. This has been the political and constitutional development in Togo as well. Since 1969, it has a One Party System, the Rassemblement du Peuple Togolais, founded by the President of the <b>Togolese</b> <b>Republic,</b> Gen. Gnassingbé Eyadéma. But, as everywhere else, doubts are growing about the effectiveness of the One Party System. Are the Togolese perspectives such that Eyadéma is willing to have an open mind and to be all ears for the critics to his own creation? Another intriguing question is to know in which way the Africantraditional authorities (" chieftancy"), as the core of the concern for the local world and as the embodiment of a moral and political order, could have a new (?) role in the socio-political development of the state in Africa? Will the chiefs' position in the long term be that of a noble élite, an echo from the past, useful as a tourist attraction or as managers of fun parks with safari possibilities...|$|R
