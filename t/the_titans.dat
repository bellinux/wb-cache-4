5|$|Age of Mythology shared many {{elements}} of gameplay {{with the main}} series, and was considered {{a part of the}} series, despite its different focus. The campaign in Age of Mythology tells the story of an Atlantean, Arkantos, and his quest to find why his people are out of favor with Poseidon. Microsoft published the game on October 30, 2002, and its expansion, <b>The</b> <b>Titans,</b> on October 21, 2003. <b>The</b> <b>Titans</b> featured the Atlanteans as a new civilization. Its campaign is shorter than previous expansions, and centers on Kastor, son of Arkantos, who falls for the lies of <b>the</b> <b>titans</b> and frees them from Tartarus. Age of Mythology sold more than one million units in four months. It scored 89% on Game Rankings and Metacritic. <b>The</b> <b>Titans</b> failed to equal the sales success of Age of Mythology, although critics rated it highly.|$|E
5|$|Baugh invited some 100 {{players to}} the Titans' first {{training}} camp, which {{opened at the}} University of New Hampshire on July 9, 1960. As NFL teams cut players from their training camps, many were invited to the Titans' or other AFL training camps as the teams sought to fill their 35-man rosters. The franchise's first preseason game took place on August 6, 1960, against the Los Angeles Chargers at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. <b>The</b> <b>Titans</b> kicked off to begin the game, and Chargers running back Paul Lowe returned the kick 105yards for a touchdown. New York lost, 27–7. On September 11, 1960, the opening regular season game was played in a heavy downpour, the remains of Hurricane Diana. Water poured off Coogan's Bluff, situated above the Polo Grounds, swamping the field, which had poor drainage. The Titans' offense was less affected by the mud {{than that of the}} visiting Buffalo Bills. <b>The</b> <b>Titans</b> won the game 27–3 before a crowd of 9,607 (5,727paid attendance). The following week New York played another home game, against the Boston Patriots. On the first of many occasions when the team would lose a game after taking a big lead, <b>the</b> <b>Titans</b> were ahead 24–7 in the second half. With the lead reduced to 24–21, <b>the</b> <b>Titans</b> punted from deep in their own territory with seconds left. The punter, Rick Sapienza, fumbled the snap, and the Patriots recovered in the end zone for the victory. The following week, with <b>the</b> <b>Titans</b> playing at the Denver Broncos, New York blocked a punt on the final play to win the game. In their fourth game, New York had a two-point lead when it fumbled with fifteen seconds left against the Dallas Texans. This set off a scramble for the ball, which <b>the</b> <b>Titans</b> recovered as time ran out. Viewers in New York were spared the harrowing ending; in a prelude to the Heidi Game eight years later, the local ABC station had switched to a Walt Disney Davey Crockett special at 6:30p.m. Many viewers called to complain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Titan</b> IIIB was <b>the</b> {{collective}} {{name for}} a number of derivatives of <b>the</b> <b>Titan</b> II ICBM and Titan III launch vehicle, modified by the addition of an Agena upper stage. It consisted of four separate rockets. <b>The</b> <b>Titan</b> 23B was a basic Titan II with an Agena upper stage, and <b>the</b> <b>Titan</b> 24B was <b>the</b> same concept, but using <b>the</b> slightly enlarged <b>Titan</b> IIIM rocket as <b>the</b> base. <b>The</b> <b>Titan</b> 33B was a <b>Titan</b> 23B with <b>the</b> Agena (which had a smaller diameter than <b>the</b> <b>Titan)</b> enclosed in an enlarged fairing, in order to allow larger payloads to be launched. The final member of <b>the</b> <b>Titan</b> IIIB family was <b>the</b> <b>Titan</b> 34B which was a <b>Titan</b> 24B with <b>the</b> larger fairing used on <b>the</b> <b>Titan</b> 33B.|$|R

5|$|Five {{weeks into}} the season, guard Howard Glenn broke his neck during a loss to the Houston Oilers, and died a few hours later, {{becoming}} the first player in professional football to die from injuries sustained on the field. New York suffered other injuries as the season progressed, and Wismer lacked the money to replace the injured players. Several players had to play both offense and defense. Wismer had arranged for <b>the</b> <b>Titans</b> to play three home games before their cross-river rivals, the Giants, started their season. This meant <b>the</b> <b>Titans</b> had to play their final three games on the road, and Wismer claimed to have lost $150,000 on the trip. <b>The</b> <b>Titans</b> finished their first season 7–7; according to attendance figures released by the team, <b>the</b> <b>Titans</b> drew an average of 16,375fans per game. This claim was mocked by the New York press, which reported that the fans had disguised themselves as empty seats. The New York Times estimated that the team had lost $450,000 for the season; in his autobiography, Wismer set the figure at $1.2million.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, Ben Roethlisberger threw his second {{touchdown}} pass of the game—to Hines Ward—to give the Steelers their only {{lead of the}} game.

5|$|Gaia was {{the mother}} of <b>the</b> <b>Titans</b> and {{embodiment}} of Earth. At the request of Zeus' mother Rhea, Gaia raised and protected the young Zeus to prevent Cronos from devouring him, as he had devoured his other children. When Zeus grew to manhood, he betrayed Gaia, freed his siblings, and Gaia was banished with her fellow Titans {{at the conclusion of the}} Great War. In God of War II, she saved Kratos from the Underworld after a disastrous encounter with Zeus, and directed the Spartan to find the Sisters of Fate in order to take revenge on Zeus. A successful Kratos plucked Gaia and <b>the</b> <b>Titans</b> from the moment in time before their defeat in the Great War to launch an abortive attack on Olympus. In God of War III, Gaia was wounded in the assault on Olympus and abandoned Kratos, stating he was a pawn of <b>the</b> <b>Titans</b> so that they could have their revenge. Kratos eventually found and crippled Gaia, but she returned and interrupted the final battle between the Spartan and Zeus. The pair entered Gaia's neck wound, and with the Blade of Olympus, Kratos destroyed her heart, killing the Titan.|$|E

Helped {{by the spirit}} of Athena who was elevated {{to a new level}} of understanding, she instructs him to seek the Flame of Olympus in order to defeat Zeus. Kratos engages the gods and <b>the</b> <b>Titans</b> in an epic series of battles across the Underworld and Olympus and learns that Pandora's Box is within the Flame. He discovers that Pandora herself is the key to pacifying the Flame and allowing him to open the Box. After finally killing Zeus, he refuses to help Athena assume the role of new patron of mankind and disappears.|$|E
50|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>Titan</b> rockets were <b>the</b> <b>Titan</b> II ICBM {{and their}} {{civilian}} derivatives for NASA. <b>The</b> <b>Titan</b> II used <b>the</b> LR-87-5 engine, {{a modified version}} of the LR-87, that relied on a hypergolic propellant combination of nitrogen tetroxide for its oxidizer and Aerozine 50 (a 50/50 mix of hydrazine and UDMH) for its fuel instead of the liquid oxygen and RP-1 combination used in <b>the</b> <b>Titan</b> I.|$|R

5|$|On {{the second}} day of the draft, Echols was {{selected}} with the 12th pick of the fourth round by the Tennessee Titans. On July 15, he signed a rookie contract with <b>the</b> <b>Titans.</b> However, on July 26, he was placed on the active/physically unable to perform list by <b>the</b> <b>Titans.</b> He made his debut with <b>the</b> <b>Titans</b> in week one against the Philadelphia Eagles. He recorded three tackles in the game. In week three, against the Cleveland Browns, Echols allowed the game–winning eight–yard touchdown to Browns wide receiver Dennis Northcutt. In the Titans' week four game against the Oakland Raiders, he suffered a leg injury and did not play another game for the rest of the season. He underwent surgery on his left tibia in December. He finished the season with 24 tackles in four games. The following season, he played sparingly, appearing in just five games and recording just eight tackles. His season debut came in week six against the Houston Texans, in which he recorded no tackles. Against both the Jacksonville Jaguars and Miami Dolphins, he recorded three tackles. In the 2004 preseason, after starting cornerback Samari Rolle injured his ankle, Echols started at right cornerback for <b>the</b> <b>Titans.</b> On August 30, against the Dallas Cowboys, he gave up 35-yard pass interference penalty, leading to the Cowboys' Billy Cundiff making a field goal to end the first half of the game. Despite starting, he was considered a candidate to be traded at the end of training camp, only to be released on September 14.|$|E
5|$|Turner {{had never}} been a head coach before; he faced a team {{convinced}} that Baugh had been treated shabbily by Wismer and had difficulty uniting the players. After <b>the</b> <b>Titans</b> split their first two games against Oakland and the Chargers (who had moved to San Diego), the team came home to no paychecks. The players refused to practice, though they worked out on their own on Friday. They then flew to Buffalo and defeated the winless Bills. Public attention in New York was focused on the established local teams, as well as the abysmal record of the fledgling Mets, who nevertheless attracted a cult following. <b>The</b> <b>Titans</b> received little publicity and attracted only 4,719 fans to the home opener against Denver. They were required to wait {{until the end of the}} Mets' season before they were allowed to use the Polo Grounds. The Broncos defeated <b>the</b> <b>Titans,</b> 32–10, and Titans quarterback Dean Look suffered a career-ending injury. New York's financial and football woes continued through October 1962, and at the beginning of November, Wismer informed AFL commissioner Joe Foss that he lacked the money to continue operations. The league assumed the cost of running the team for the rest of 1962; Wismer remained in nominal charge. <b>The</b> <b>Titans</b> had little success on the field (the highlight was a 46–45 victory at favored Denver on Thanksgiving), and finished the season insolvent with a 5–9 record.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein {{produced}} a similar substance, {{but could not}} identify it.

5|$|At Wisconsin, {{he was a}} four–year starter at cornerback. He {{finished}} his career with a recovered fumble and 12 interceptions, returning one for a touchdown. Before his junior season in 2000, he was suspended one game for receiving unadvertised discounts at a shoe store. After the season, he was given second–team All–Big Ten Conference honors. In 2002, after graduating from Wisconsin, he declared for the NFL Draft. He was drafted by <b>the</b> <b>Titans</b> and debuted later that season. However, after four weeks, he injured his leg and missed {{the rest of the}} season. The following season, he saw limited action before being released by the team in 2004. After his stint with <b>the</b> <b>Titans</b> ended, he spent time with the Atlanta Falcons, Indianapolis Colts, and Detroit Lions, failing to appear in a game for any of the teams. In 2006, Echols played his final professional game for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the CFL, intercepting a pass in his only game for the team.|$|E
5|$|Development on Crash: Mind over Mutant began {{immediately}} {{after the completion of}} Crash of <b>the</b> <b>Titans.</b> The idea of preserving a titan for later use came from the play testing sessions of Crash of <b>the</b> <b>Titans,</b> in which the testers were found to be reluctant to leave <b>the</b> <b>titans</b> behind after an epic battle was won. Fans of the series were also a source of inspiration for Crash: Mind over Mutant, having such wishes as a free-roaming environment, Coco Bandicoot being a playable character and the return of the character Doctor Nitrus Brio. Full camera control was considered for the game, but was rejected for graphical reasons and to avoid having to insert a split-screen view in the cooperation mode. Online gameplay was also considered as a feature in the finished game, but was omitted due to the brief development schedule. Coco Bandicoot as a playable character was omitted from the PlayStation 2 version of the game due to her distinct animations taking up much of the console's memory. The Wii version of Crash: Mind over Mutant was created first, with the graphics scaled up for the Xbox 360, and scaled down for the PlayStation 2. A PlayStation 3 version of the game was rumored, but was promptly debunked by Radical Entertainment as a mistake on many press sites' behalf.|$|E
5|$|Enceladus {{is named}} after the giant Enceladus of Greek mythology. The name, like the names {{of each of the}} first seven {{satellites}} of Saturn to be discovered, was suggested by William Herschel's son John Herschel in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope. He chose these names because Saturn, known in Greek mythology as Cronus, was the leader of <b>the</b> <b>Titans.</b>|$|E
50|$|Upon {{reaching}} <b>the</b> <b>Titan,</b> <b>the</b> Ork/Chaos alliance descends on the Imperial encampment protecting <b>the</b> <b>Titan.</b> <b>The</b> crew {{begins to}} work, but they require a {{massive amount of}} power to use <b>the</b> <b>Titan,</b> and Sturnn is forced to protect <b>the</b> <b>Titan,</b> several power generators, and a nearby Imperial encampment of survivors from the Forces of Disorder. Although <b>the</b> <b>Titan</b> is too badly damaged to move until extensive repairs can be carried out, its now-operational weapons easily dispatch the Orks and Chaos. However, the Necrons now awaken, and butcher the remaining forces of the Ork/Chaos alliance. Beginning their slow march to destroy the only living souls left, the Imperials, they nearly succeed before <b>the</b> <b>Titan</b> Crew is able to destroy the Necron Monoliths using the Titan's weapons. Ultimately, the Cadian 412th and the Ultramarines are successful in repairing <b>the</b> <b>Titan,</b> destroying <b>the</b> Ork/Chaos alliance, and stopping the Necrons before they escaped the planet, but {{at the cost of}} Taldeer and her Eldar - which does not bother Sturnn or the Ultramarines in any way, since destruction of all things alien and heretical is Imperial state policy.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>Titan</b> rockets were <b>the</b> <b>Titan</b> II, {{which could}} carry a W-53 nuclear warhead with a nine megaton yield, {{making it the}} most {{powerful}} ICBM on-standby in the US nuclear arsenal.
