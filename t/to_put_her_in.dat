5|$|As {{the episode}} opens, Mossad Officer Amir Mantel (Dove Meir) is shot dead at point blank range in an American parking garage. At NCIS headquarters, Ziva cancels plans to pursue Eli David's killer, Ilan Bodnar (Oded Fehr), in Rome, having {{come to the}} {{conclusion}} that he will relocate to Berlin shortly. Before she and Tony depart, the new Mossad director, Orli Elbaz (Marina Sirtis), arrives in hopes of collaborating with the agency in the search for Bodnar. Ziva frostily congratulates her for her promotion and declines an offer <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> contact with Mossad operatives in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Bokhary's first {{brush with}} the police {{was in the early}} hours of 24 June 2001, when the manager of a bar in Central {{district}} of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance. When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary, she hit one officer on the cheek; it took four officers at the scene <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> handcuffs. Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E
5|$|The outpost is {{evacuated}} {{during the}} dangerous mission, {{leaving only the}} Enterprise away team on surface. The firestorms overwhelm the position that Daren's team occupies {{before they can be}} retrieved. Believing Daren to be dead, Picard sits contemplating his decision in his quarters. He then hears that survivors are being transported aboard, and heads to the transporter room. Daren is not among the initial group of survivors, but is later transported to the ship. Eight members of the team have died. Afterwards, Picard and Daren discuss their relationship. They conclude that it cannot continue, as Picard could not bear <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> danger once more. They discuss giving up their Starfleet careers to be together. Daren realizes that Picard, still cherishing the family life he experienced as Kamin, has nonetheless chosen duty, career, and loneliness. They both know that Daren must transfer off the Enterprise. They kiss once more, and Daren makes Picard promise not to give up music.|$|E

25|$|Sorokina {{remained}} highly {{ranked in}} the 1982 season, including a lifetime best in the 800m of 1:56.6 minutes (placing her seventh on the year's rankings). She again ran below four minutes for the 1500m and her best of 3:59.24 minutes though slower than the previous year was enough <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the season's top ten. A Soviet trio of Sorokina, Olga Dvirna and Zamira Zaytseva were entered into the 1500m for the 1982 European Athletics Championships. Her compatriots took the top two spots, but Sorokina failed to produce her season's best and finished in sixth place. This {{proved to be the}} last high-profile international appearance that she made. In her last year of competition in 1983 she ranked sixth in the world for the 1500m.|$|E
25|$|After {{experiencing}} multiple {{delays in}} the release of Sparks's third album due to RCA refusing <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> their roster, citing that her acting projects had prevented them from reaching a deal, Sparks was released from her contract from RCA records and eventually signed to Salaam Remi's new label imprint 'Louder than Life', a subsidiary of Sony Music.

As {{a result of the}} new deal, all the material Sparks had previously recorded for her third album under RCA has subsequently been scrapped and had since begun re-recording and writing new material for her third album since January 2014. An official announcement of Sparks's signing to the new label had only been released a year later in August 2014.|$|E

Fries' boss Ferris Boyle decides to tell the mob about the gun, leading Batman to create a team of specialists to help him do his job better. Fries decides to use the device on Nora, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> cryo-stasis.

Fries survives, but the chemicals in the freeze ray lower his body temperature to the point that he must wear a cryogenic suit in order to survive. He swears revenge on those responsible for the death of his wife (whom he talks to often), and becomes Mr. Freeze, the first supervillain Batman faces in this continuity.|$|E

25|$|Contract law {{works best}} when an {{agreement}} is performed, and recourse {{to the courts}} is never needed because each party knows her rights and duties. However, where an unforeseen event renders an agreement very hard, or even impossible to perform, the courts typically will construe the parties to want to have released themselves from their obligations. It may also be that one party simply breaches a contract's terms. If a contract is not substantially performed, then the innocent party is entitled to cease her own performance and sue for damages <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the position as if the contract were performed. She is under a duty to mitigate her losses and cannot claim for harm that was a remote consequence of the contractual breach, but remedies in English law are footed {{on the principle that}} full compensation for all losses, pecuniary or not, should be made good. In exceptional circumstances, the law goes further to require a wrongdoer to make restitution for their gains from breaching a contract, and may demand specific performance of the agreement rather than monetary compensation. It is also possible that a contract becomes voidable, because, depending on the specific type of contract, one party failed to make adequate disclosure or they made misrepresentations during negotiations.|$|E

I got a taste of it when I did another video with her where she was a guest star, and I got her really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. Me and her were just vibing off that, and thought it would be really fun to do something just really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and that was sort of what we set out to do. Sometimes it's an important visual effect, today it's an important emotion." ...|$|E
500|$|Romeo begs Friar Lawrence, a sea otter, to wed them. After some thought, the friar {{believes}} {{their marriage}} {{will end the}} feud between their families, and agrees.

A fish finds them a lovely couple, but warns them {{that they will be}} in big trouble if the Prince finds out. Back on the beach, Mercutio is telling many jokes, which leads to him making insulting jokes against the Capulets, and the Prince is headed in that direction.

500|$|Lansbury was {{defensive}} about Jessica Fletcher, having creative input over the character's costumes, makeup and hair, and rejecting pressure from network executives <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> a relationship, {{believing that the}} character should remain a strong single female. When she believed that a scriptwriter had made Jessica do or say things that did not fit with the character's personality, Lansbury ensured that the script was changed. She saw Jessica {{as a role model}} for older female viewers, praising her [...] "enormous, universal appeal – that was an accomplishment I never expected in my entire life." [...] Lansbury biographers Rob Edelman and Audrey E. Kupferberg described the series as [...] "a television landmark" [...] in the U.S. for having an older female character as the protagonist, thereby paving the way for later series like The Golden Girls. Lansbury herself noted that [...] "I think it's the first time a show has really been aimed at the middle aged audience", and although it was most popular among senior citizens, it gradually gained a younger audience; by 1991, a third of viewers were under fifty. It gained continually high ratings throughout most of its run, outdoing rivals in its time slot such as Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories on NBC. In February 1987, a spin-off was produced, The Law & Harry McGraw, although it was short-lived.|$|E
500|$|Beholder was ridden {{in all of}} her two-year-old races by Garrett Gomez. She {{began her}} racing career by {{finishing}} fourth behind Executiveprivilege in a maiden race on the Cushion Track at Hollywood Park Racetrack on June 28. A month later, she recorded her first win in a maiden race at Del Mar racetrack, beating Fanticola by [...] lengths. On September 2, she was moved up to Grade I class for the Del Mar Debutante Stakes over seven furlongs. Starting at odds of 8.1–1, she hit the starting gate but took an early lead, leading by [...] lengths in homestretch, but she was caught by Executiveprivilege {{at the finish line}} and was beaten a nose. [...] Beholder moved to Santa Anita Park in October. Because she remained keyed up after the previous race and upset by the stress from shipping, Mandella chose <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> an easier race than a Grade I to see if she would settle down enough to contest the Breeders' Cup later in the year. She was entered into a six-furlong allowance race and won by eleven lengths despite being eased in the closing stages. On November 2 at Santa Anita, Beholder was one of eight fillies to contest the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies over one mile. She was the 9–2 joint second choice in the betting behind Executiveprivilege, who was made the 13–8 favourite. Beholder took the lead from the start and broke clear of the field to open up a three-length advantage on the final turn. She held off the late challenge of Executiveprivilege to win by a length.|$|E
500|$|Nick Offerman portrayed Ron Swanson, the {{director}} of the parks and recreation department, and Aubrey Plaza played April Ludgate, a sarcastic and uninterested college intern. [...] The part was written specifically for Plaza. After meeting her, [...] casting director Allison Jones told Schur, [...] "I just met the weirdest girl I've ever met in my life. You have to meet her and put her on your show." [...] Schur of meeting her, [...] "Aubrey came over to my office and made me feel really uncomfortable for like an hour, and immediately I wanted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> the show," [...] although the writers were not immediately sure what direction her character would take. Rounding out the main cast was Paul Schneider, best known for his work in independent films such as Lars and the Real Girl and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. He was cast as Mark Brendanawicz, a city planner and Leslie's unrequited love interest. She still harbors feelings for Mark from a one-night sexual encounter years ago. Schneider said that early in the season he was insecure in the role because he was {{still trying to figure out}} the character's motivations. Chris Pratt played Andy Dwyer, Ann's well-intentioned but lazy and simple-minded boyfriend. Although Pratt appeared in every episode of season 1, he was credited as guest star until the second season, when he was promoted to the main cast. Andy was originally supposed to appear only in the first season, but the producers liked Pratt so much that, almost immediately after casting him, they decided to make Andy a regular character if the show was renewed.|$|E

500|$|Pope's {{wardrobe}} {{is designed}} by Scandal costume designer Lyn Paolo (known for costume design on The West Wing, ER and Shameless), {{and it has}} {{caught the attention of}} the Vogue staff. In 2014, Washington's portrayal of Pope and her promotion of Pope's style earned her acclaim as a style influencer from the Accessories Council. Paolo attempted to make Pope stand apart from the black, gray and dark blue colors of DC by outfitting her in [...] "chic pastels" [...] going so far as <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> pink pants or Louboutin shoes at times. Some of her most respected wardrobe pieces are from notable fashion houses such as Ferragamo, Burberry, Gucci, Armani, Prada, Valentino, Tory Burch, and Michael Kors. The Valentino was saved for the season 1 finale. In addition to the luxurious elements of her wardrobe that are on loan from designers, Pope wears modest elements that Paolo picks up from Nordstrom Rack, Bloomingdale's and Loehmann's. The Pope character has become somewhat of a style icon. Harper's Bazaar and Glamour analyze her wardrobe every week in a dedicated fashion watch columns. Time describes her as [...] "a real-world lifestyle tastemaker", pointing out that the Crate & Barrel wine glasses that she drinks from on the show sold out at the store. Washington and Paolo curated a Saks Fifth Avenue installation of Pope fashions in October 2013. That season, Pope's attire was part of a special collection at Saks Fifth Avenue. In September 2014, an Olivia Pope Scandal collection was set to debut at The Limited, in what was publicized as [...] "the first design collaboration between a national retailer and a top-rated network TV show, its costume designer and star". The collaboration included [...] "tops, pants, jackets and outerwear" [...] and incorporated items priced as low as $49. The collaboration includes 42 pieces. Vulture dedicated a feature to presenting every outfit Pope wore during season 2. When her wardrobe changed to more colorful and asymmetric looks in season 3, The Huffington Post dedicated a feature to this issue. During season 3, Entertainment Weekly ranked Pope's ten best outfits. Because Pope's wardrobe is pricey, there are features and websites dedicated to cheap alternatives to the exact wardrobe elements. Paolo suggests that the Pope style be purchased at Zara and Ann Taylor. In terms of jewelry, Pope wears long necklaces and exclusively wears Movado watches. She also generally uses one of her modest collection of Prada purses.|$|E
