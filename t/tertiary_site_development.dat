40|$|Due to {{increasing}} complexity of contemporary <b>site</b> <b>development,</b> {{more information about}} sites themselves and their related environmental, geographical, and surrounding infrastructure is highly desired to support informed decision-making. Fusion of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) to support decision-making in <b>site</b> <b>development</b> has gained momentum from both academia and practitioners. Nevertheless, innovative applications of GIS and BIM integration are yet to be fully explored. Using several cases in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), this article demonstrates how to integrate GIS and BIM to derive big data for decision-making in construction logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) and construction waste management in <b>site</b> <b>development.</b> In addition, this article proposes a conceptual framework of integrating BIM and GIS for better <b>site</b> <b>development</b> and urban management. The cases in this article not only shed light on big data analytics in a <b>site</b> <b>development</b> setting but also provide useful references to GIS and BIM fusion for better urban management...|$|R

This new method allows farmers / farm managers to expand the critical resources involved in production {{as well as the}} farm to a fully saturated state. During the process of circumscription of this method in 2013; certain deficiencies were identified where improvements can be made. The new and extended farm <b>site</b> <b>development</b> method is evaluated by demonstrating a practical example at a crop growing farm in KwaZulu-Natal. The implementation of this method allows the designers to identify further deficiencies that will improve the farm <b>site</b> <b>development</b> method. Thesis (B Eng.
