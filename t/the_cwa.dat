5|$|After Corzine's breakup with Katz, {{their lawyers}} {{negotiated}} a financial payout in November 2004. According to press accounts, the settlement for Katz exceeded $6million, including cash (in part {{used to buy}} her $1.1million condominium in Hoboken), a college trust fund to educate her children, a 2005 Volvo sport utility vehicle, and Corzine forgave a $470,000 loan he had made to Katz in 2002 to buy out her ex-husband's share of their home in Alexandria Township. Katz enrolled in Seton Hall University School of Law on a full scholarship in 2004. Corzine later acknowledged he had given $15,000 to Katz's brother-in-law, Rocco Riccio, a former state employee who {{was forced to resign}} after being accused of examining income tax returns for political purposes. At the time, Katz was president of <b>the</b> <b>CWA</b> Local 1034, which bargains on behalf of many state employees.|$|E
5|$|Corzine, who {{was running}} for the United State Senate {{in the spring of}} 1999, met Carla Katz, the then married {{president}} of Local 1034 of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), in the same apartment building where he resided in Hoboken; <b>the</b> <b>CWA</b> represents the largest number of state workers in New Jersey. As Katz later recalled, Corzine offered her a job on his Senate campaign, but she declined the offer. Corzine and the still married Katz were soon dating, and they began appearing in public as a couple in early 2002, shortly after Corzine's unofficial separation from his wife, Joanne. (The Corzines divorced the following year.) For more than two years Corzine was romantically involved and living with Katz. She lived with him at his apartment building in Hoboken from April 2002 until August 2004.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, when Corzine was running in the New Jersey gubernatorial election, news first emerged of his {{relationship}} with Katz and the money she had received. Corzine was elected governor despite the scandal. In the fall of 2006, during an impasse in contract negotiations between the Corzine administration and the state's seven major state employee unions (including <b>the</b> <b>CWA),</b> Katz contacted the governor by phone and e-mail to lobby for a renewal of the negotiations. Their relationship and the financial settlement Katz received after their breakup led to allegations of many potential conflicts of interest in labor negotiations while Corzine was governor. A state ethics panel, acting on a complaint from Bogota mayor Steve Lonegan, ruled in May 2007 that Katz's contact with Corzine during negotiations did not violate the governor's code of conduct.|$|E

5|$|Denise Mina had {{not written}} for comics {{when she took}} over the title in 2006, but had three {{acclaimed}} crime novels to her name, the Garnetthill trilogy, {{the first of which}} won <b>the</b> <b>CWA</b> award for best debut crime novel. Her run on the title took John to Scotland, to attempt to stop a plot to make everybody empathise with each other. However, John fails to stop this, and, overwhelmed by the grief and horror they're forced to empathically share, suicides abound through the people of Glasgow. With help from Gemma Constantine, Angie Spatchcock and Chas Chandler, a plan to reverse the problem is made, as tension builds among the soldiers now surrounding the city. The soldiers keenly listen to a World Cup match between England and Portugal on the radio. When England loses the match, it seems all is lost, but the expected psychic riot fails to materialize. The soldiers are Scottish, so England's loss is celebrated, saving the day, and proving there's no source of joy like Schadenfreude.|$|E

25|$|Regarding {{the defense}} of the family, <b>the</b> <b>CWA</b> was a latecomer to the {{opposition}} of the ERA. <b>The</b> <b>CWA</b> believes that the woman's place is within the home, therefore the rights set forth by the ERA threatened the traditional nuclear family. <b>The</b> <b>CWA</b> built a national network of prayer chains in opposition to the ERA. For these reasons, it is unsurprising that <b>the</b> <b>CWA</b> was an active and vocal supporter of the Defense of Marriage Act (prior to its being deemed unconstitutional), for, {{at the time of its}} enactment, the DOMA declared homosexual marriages to be illegal, thus supporting the CWA's ideals of both heterosexuality and marriage.|$|E

Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>CWA</b> Light Heavyweight Championship {{was dominated by}} Ray Odyssey and The Pink Assassin, and Double Trouble (Tony & Val Puccio) were the first tag team champions, followed by Ray Odyssey and Vic Steamboat. Rumble himself would hold <b>the</b> <b>CWA</b> New England Heavyweight Championship a record 3-times during a five-year period before his wife, and then CWA President, stripped him of the title when the promotion joined the National Wrestling Alliance.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the rules}} of <b>the</b> <b>CWA</b> still applied to the {{disabled}} veterans' memorial, however. The memorial foundation was required to raise enough private funds to design and build the memorial, and an amount equal to 10 percent of the memorial's construction cost also needed to be raised and placed in a trust fund for the memorial's maintenance and operation. <b>The</b> <b>CWA</b> gave the foundation seven years to begin construction, or its authorization would expire.|$|E

40|$|Progress in intellectual, {{academic}} and psychosocial-self-care achievements among 30 {{children with autism}} (CWA) within five years (2006 to 2010) was determined utilizing inter-correlations through Pearson r.

To determine this, repeated-measures ANOVA was used. Results indicated that there were significant increases in <b>the</b> <b>CWA’s</b> intellectual, academic and psychosocialself-care achievements within five years while {{there were no significant differences}} among the selected factors mentioned in terms of <b>the</b> <b>CWA’s</b> intellectual, academic and psychosocial-self-care achievements except for shift in placement from small to big school.
