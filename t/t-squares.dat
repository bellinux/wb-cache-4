500|$|Competition {{within the}} University of London is most intense between King's and University College London, the two oldest institutions. Indeed, the University of London {{when it was}} {{established}} {{has been described as}} [...] "an umbrella organisation designed to disguise the rivalry between UCL and KCL." [...] In the early twentieth century, King's College London and UCL rivalry was centred on their respective mascots. University College's was Phineas Maclino, a wooden tobacconist's sign of a kilted Jacobite Highlander purloined from outside a shop in Tottenham Court Road during the celebrations of the relief of Ladysmith in 1900. King's later addition was a giant beer bottle representing [...] "bottled youth". In 1923 it was replaced by a new mascot to rival Phineas – Reggie the Lion, who made his debut at a King's-UCL sporting rag in December 1923, protected by a lifeguard of engineering students armed with <b>T-squares.</b> Thereafter, Reggie formed the centrepiece of annual freshers' processions by King's students around Aldwych in which new students were typically flour bombed.|$|E
2500|$|In 1935, New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia {{attended}} {{the opening of}} the inaugural exhibit at the Federal Art Project Gallery, accompanied by Audrey McMahon, New York regional director for the Works Progress Administration/Federal Art Project. Among the works on display was Abstraction, a sketch by Swinden; it was the design for a mural planned for the College of the City of New York. A newspaper account described it as consisting of [...] "brightly colored <b>T-squares,</b> triangles and rulers in horizontal, vertical and diagonal positions". La Guardia [...] asked what it was, and upon being told it was a mural design, he said he didn't know what it depicted. Someone joked that it could be a map of Manhattan. The displeased mayor stated that [...] "if that's art, I belong to Tammany Hall." [...] (Tammany Hall, which the Republican mayor referenced, was the New York Democratic Party political society.) Fearing that the mayor's negative attitude could jeopardize the future of abstract art within the Federal Art Project, McMahon dispatched an assistant to summon an artist who could speak to the mayor in defense of abstraction. The assistant returned with Arshile Gorky.|$|E

5000|$|A T-square is a {{technical}} drawing instrument used by draftsmen {{primarily as a}} guide for drawing horizontal lines on a drafting table.

50|$|Drafting & Design Academy Drafting Program The Drafting Program {{introduces}} {{students to}} the elements of residential and commercial architecture and civil engineering, using compasses, dividers, <b>T-squares</b> and architectural scales.

Internship opportunities with local companies provide relevant learning experiences. Students entering this program must have a 2.0 GPA.|$|E
50|$|T-Square is a {{small part}} of the reason people use today's {{computers}} for drafting, architecture, drawing and illustration and engineering. Prior to this revolution and in some places to this day, draftsmen and women used triangles, wood or metal <b>T-squares,</b> pencils and technical pens on film and paper.

50|$|Common cardmaking {{materials}} include: cardstock, stencils, markers, vellum, tissue paper, glue, {{rulers and}} <b>t-squares,</b> rickrack, foil, sequins, beads, ribbon, acetate, paper embossing, die cutting machines and more.Other materials {{that can be}} used in cardmaking are brads, eyelets, tea bag medallions, and buttons. Brads can be used to hold the four corners of one piece of cardstock on top of another to create a layered effect. Eyelets can be used to draw a piece of string or ribbon from one side of the card to another. Tea bag medallions are a type of origami that makes a wonderful decoration for the front of a card. Pretty shaped buttons make nice additions to a design.|$|E
5000|$|In mid 2000, {{the band}} was divided into <b>T-Square</b> (original and {{long-term}} guitarist Masahiro Andoh, returning saxophonist Takeshi Itoh and session musicians) and Trio The Square (bassist Mitsuru Sutoh, drummer Hiroyuki Noritake and keyboardist Keiji Matumoto). This trio was {{the main reason for}} why <b>T-Square</b> had to employ session musicians to record {{with the exception of the}} [...] "Friendship Live" [...] performance. The performance had ex-long term drummer, Hiroyuki Noritake, along with then-Support/Guest-keyboardist, Keizoh Kawano, and support bassist Kiyoshi Murakami. <b>T-Square</b> changed its name again to <b>T-Square</b> Plus. Former <b>T-Square</b> guitarist Yuhji Mikuriya as well as former Seikima-II bassist Shunsuke [...] "Xenon" [...] Ishikawa and session keyboardist Takehiro Kawabe, joined them briefly in 2002. <b>T-Square</b> Plus, as this incarnation of the group was called, dropped the [...] "Plus" [...] from their name, but kept using session musicians until 2003.|$|R
5000|$|This {{marks the}} second time that <b>T-Square</b> has branded {{themselves}} [...] "T-Square Super Band", now in promotion of their 35th Anniversary. They retained all members of the Super Band from 2008, except for pianist Hirotaka Izumi. Percussionist Kiyohiko Senba, who was also an original member of The Square, is a member of <b>T-Square's</b> Super Band as of 2013. Shingo Tanaka was also promoted from being a support member and is now an official member of <b>T-Square.</b> Upon the Release of [...] "Smile", the new <b>T-Square</b> Super Band Album, a picture was included in the release, with Japanese Text/Kanji clearly reading something to the effect of [...] "Itoh's Resignation", thus making fans believe that Takeshi Itoh has once again left <b>T-Square.</b> Even in their last album of 2013, (<b>T-Square</b> Plus - History), Itoh only performed on 2 Tracks of the album, adding more reason for the rumor to be believed.|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, the <b>T-square</b> is a {{two-dimensional}} fractal. It has a boundary of infinite length bounding a finite area. Its {{name comes from}} the drawing instrument known as a <b>T-square.</b>|$|R
50|$|This ceiling {{represents}} Lord Burlington's {{interest in}} architecture. Alternatively the painted ceiling {{and its surrounding}} decoration (including the presence of rats and snakes) {{can be interpreted as}} having a Masonic program, as dividers, set-squares, <b>T-Squares</b> and plumb lines were important Masonic symbols of morality. The putto to the left of ‘Architecture’ holds his finger to his lips suggesting silence or secrecy - a gesture mimicking the Egyptian child god of silence, Harpocrates. The idea that this room could have been used for initiation into Masonic mysteries is further supported by the proportions of this room as a perfect cube measuring 15x15x15 feet - the equivalent of 10 cubits by 10 cubits by 10 cubits, the stated dimensions of the Holy of Holies within Moses' Tabernacle according to the Bible.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the tools}} of manual {{drafting}} include pencils, pens and their ink, straightedges, <b>T-squares,</b> French curves, triangles, rulers, protractors, dividers, compasses, scales, erasers, and tacks or push pins. (Slide rules used to number among the supplies, too, but nowadays even manual drafting, when it occurs, benefits from a pocket calculator or its onscreen equivalent.) And of course the tools also include drawing boards (drafting boards) or tables. The English idiom [...] "to {{go back to the}} drawing board", which is a figurative phrase meaning to rethink something altogether, was inspired by the literal act of discovering design errors during production and returning to a drawing board to revise the engineering drawing. Drafting machines are devices that aid manual drafting by combining drawing boards, straightedges, pantographs, and other tools into one integrated drawing environment. CAD provides their virtual equivalents.|$|E
5000|$|Pear wood {{is one of}} the {{preferred}} materials in the manufacture of high-quality woodwind instruments and furniture, and was used for making the carved blocks for woodcuts. It is also used for wood carving, and as a firewood to produce aromatic smoke for smoking meat or tobacco. Pear wood is valued for kitchen spoons, scoops and stirrers, as it does not contaminate food with color, flavor or smell, and resists warping and splintering despite repeated soaking and drying cycles. Lincoln describes it as [...] "a fairly tough, very stable wood... (used for) carving... brushbacks, umbrella handles, measuring instruments such as set squares and <b>T-squares...</b> recorders... violin and guitar fingerboards and piano keys... decorative veneering." [...] Pearwood is the favored wood for architect's rulers because it does not warp. It is similar to the wood of its relative, the apple tree (Malus domestica) and used for many of the same purposes.|$|E
5000|$|The band's {{performance}} at the Roxy marked their first live album as <b>T-Square.</b> Two years later, Masato Honda debuted with them as a backing saxophonist on the album <b>T-Square</b> Live (featuring F1 Grand Prix Theme). In 1991, <b>T-Square's</b> original saxophonist, Takeshi Itoh, pursued a solo career, and Masato Honda replaced him. Honda also composed the opening track from <b>T-Square's</b> [...] "New-S" [...] Album (released in 1991), [...] "Megalith". After {{the release of the}} [...] "Blue in Red" [...] album in 1997, Honda left the group to pursue his solo career. Takahiro Miyazaki would replace him. At the same time, Hirotaka Izumi left <b>T-Square</b> and was replaced by Tadashi Namba. Namba played keyboards on the theme song from Gran Turismo, [...] "Moon Over The Castle" [...] (from Masahiro's solo album [...] "Andy's", released in 1996) as well as the <b>T-Square</b> arrangement of the song, called [...] "Knight's Song", from [...] "Blue in Red". The group and all former and (at the time) current members played at Yaon de Asobu for their 20th Anniversary that same year. This {{is one of the last}} <b>T-Square</b> performances in which Masato Honda was involved (unlike Miyazaki and Itoh, Honda didn't particiipate in next three anniversary concerts in 2003, 2008, and 2013 respectively). In 1999, Tadashi Namba was replaced by Keyboardist Keiji Matsumoto. The new line-up of Miyazaki, Noritake, Sutoh, Matsumoto and Andoh was kept until mid-2000.|$|R
5000|$|A {{few months}} later, {{he made an}} {{appearance}} as a Guest Vocalist of Japanese Jazz Fusion Band <b>T-Square</b> on their album, 33. The song he was featured in is called [...] "Tell the Truth", {{which is based on}} <b>T-Square's</b> hit from 1987, [...] "Truth".|$|R
