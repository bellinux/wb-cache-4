5|$|A new {{task of the}} Güell-López's for Comillas was <b>the</b> <b>gazebo</b> for Alfonso XII's {{visit to}} the Cantabrian town in 1881. Gaudí {{designed}} a small pavilion {{in the shape of}} a Hindu turban, covered in mosaics and decorated with an abundance of small bells which jingled constantly. It was subsequently moved into the Güell Pavilions.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{an article}} was {{published}} about the bell's submersion and resurfacing at Geneva Lake. The article interested {{the people of}} Mount Morris, Illinois, and they sent 12 members of their Fourth of July Committee to investigate the bell in Johnsburg. The people of Mount Morris decided to purchase the bell; a committee was formed and obtained a loan from the Mount Morris VFW. The group also collected donations from local residents to purchase the bell for US$500. By July 4, 1966, the Illinois Freedom Bell hung from <b>the</b> <b>gazebo</b> in its current location, and the two writers who first suggested bell ringing as an annual Independence Day ceremony, Eric Hatch and Eric Sloane were on hand for its dedication.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the episode's {{original}} broadcast, {{a copy of a}} desk calendar chronicling all of Ron Swanson's meetings {{from the}} episode was placed on the official Parks and Recreation website. That site also featured three deleted scenes from the episode. In the first, 80-second clip, Leslie and Jessica get into a fight about <b>the</b> <b>gazebo,</b> and Jessica reveals she has trimmed the mansion's historic hedges into the shape of elephants. The second clip, which lasted one minute, features several more of Ron Swanson's meetings, including one where he tries to literally will a man away with his mind. Andy also tells Ron he accidentally agreed to sell the recreation center to the Quiznos fast food restaurant chain. In the third, 90-second clip, Leslie tries to end Nick Newport Sr.'s birthday party by pulling the plug on the lights, but accidentally disconnects his breathing machine instead.|$|E

25|$|Mansfield, Missouri is {{the chosen}} final {{home town of}} Laura Ingalls Wilder. It was here, on her farm, that she wrote the Little House books.

There is a big parade, and folk music is played from <b>the</b> <b>gazebo</b> in the park.|$|E

There were no other changes to the district or its buildings throughout the next several decades other than the installation of asbestos siding to some of them.

25|$|The city hall, {{often called}} the Palacio de Gobierno, is a Neoclassical {{construction}} which {{was built in the}} 19th century by architect Carlos Z. Flores.

25|$|Instead of a {{traditional}} plaza, the center is a basketball court which {{is in front of}} the beach and serves as a point of reference. It is surrounded by benches and shade trees. Next to this are <b>the</b> <b>gazebo</b> and the Casa de la Cultura. These venues host music, concerts, cultural presentations, art shows. The main thoroughfare for cars is Juan Alvarez, a block behind the malecón. Sections of several of the main streets are designated pedestrian zones.

25|$|On January 1, 1853, Keil {{published}} his new magazine under the inconspicuous title , named after <b>the</b> <b>gazebo</b> {{in his garden}} in Leipzig. Initially he could not serve as editor because his press credentials had been revoked {{and he was still}} under police surveillance, so he borrowed the firm of Stolle & Diezmann for the first run of 5000 copies. His objective was to reach and enlighten the whole family, especially the German middle classes, through a carefully-crafted mixture of current events, essays on the natural sciences, biographies, short stories, poetry, and full-page illustrations. The magazine's masthead depicted a grandfatherly figure reading to a family around a table.|$|E
500|$|Lisa joins Mensa {{alongside}} Comic Book Guy, Dr. Hibbert, Principal Skinner, Professor Frink, and Lindsay Naegle. After the pleasantries, Lisa {{finds herself}} at home alongside the Mensa members, whose {{sense of humor}} is so esoteric that {{it is said to}} be enjoyed by the [...] "Dennis Miller ratio" [...] of Americans. After being bullied out of their reserved gazebo at a park by drunks and Chief Wiggum, they fear that Springfield's quality is poor because of the city's stupidest residents having power over their civic institutions. The Mensa group goes to confront Mayor Quimby about <b>the</b> <b>gazebo</b> incident, until he escapes from the city when he mistakenly thinks the group has evidence about his corruption. The town's constitution states that {{in the absence of the}} mayor, the town is to be governed by the smartest by geniocracy. Now in control of Springfield, the group hopes that things will become much better.|$|E
500|$|Leslie is outraged when Jessica reveals {{her plans}} to {{demolish}} an old gazebo {{in the backyard}} of Turnbill Mansion, {{the site of a}} historic wedding between a Pawnee Native American and white woman, which became a [...] "bloodbath" [...] when knowledge of the wedding became public. Under Leslie's orders, Tom chains Leslie to the front gate to prevent construction crews from entering. However, she mistakenly assumes the gate opens from the middle, allowing the crews to enter right past Leslie and demolish <b>the</b> <b>gazebo.</b> At the end of the day, Ann and Mark (Paul Schneider) arrive to free her, and Leslie finally reveals to Tom the true source of her anxiety—Mark's intentions to marry Ann. Leslie feels emotional confusion over this fact. On the one hand, she wants her friends to be happy. On the other hand, she used to have romantic feelings for Mark, she feels insecure about being single, and she worries about losing her two friends. In response, Tom assures her not to worry, thus empowering Leslie to crash and ruin Jessica's party.|$|E
