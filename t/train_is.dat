The Sm6 is {{technically}} based on the Pendolino Nuovo, but its looks are similar to the Sm3. The most significant difference is that an Sm6 unit is composed of seven carriages. The <b>train</b> <b>is</b> capable of dual-voltage running due to differences between the electric systems of the Finnish and Russian rail network and is equipped with four pantographs.|$|E
5|$|In the station, {{the trains}} are {{oriented}} in a vertical position {{in order to}} allow riders to board. Once the restraints are locked, the train seats are rotated forward 90 degrees into a horizontal position and the <b>train</b> <b>is</b> then dispatched from the station. When the train returns to the station, the seats rotate back down and the riders disembark for the next guests.|$|E

After a few seconds, the <b>train</b> <b>is</b> released into the drop.|$|E
