40|$|Abstract. When rolling <b>thread</b> <b>shaft</b> {{in cross}} wedge rolling, forming quality of thread is {{affected}} by many process parameters such as the thread helix angle, which is a special and complex parameter. However, there is few study {{of the effect of}} the thread helix angle on <b>thread</b> <b>shaft</b> forming. In this paper how thread helix angle affects axial metal flow was analyzed from the perspective of rolling force and the forming process of <b>thread</b> <b>shaft</b> was simulated with different helix angles by the deform- 3 D software. Through the measurement of the point coordinates, the effect of the helix angle on the axial metal flow of rolled pieces was analyzed. Finally, the conclusion was obtained that helix angle causes the asymmetry of axial metal flow with small difference values for asymmetry and the axial metal flow of rolled pieces increases as the helix angle increases. The rolling thread segment can be ensured in the middle of rolled pieces by moving the blank a suitable distance in the reverse direction of the axial flow direction...|$|R

The defects of {{the lower}} tooth height and of larger pitch in thread portion of rolled pieces are prone to {{appearing}} when rolling <b>thread</b> <b>shaft</b> in cross wedge rolling. To solve this problem, changing the blank shape and size were tried. Two types of concave conical and round blanks are designed with concave conical blanks obtained by rolling in the cross wedge rolling. Because {{the design of the}} rolling die is simple, good precision of blank can be ensured. Multiple size types of blanks were designed and the rolling experiment was made in the rolling mill of model H 630. By measuring the values of the tooth height and pitch, the effect of blank shape on <b>thread</b> <b>shafts</b> rolled in the wedge rolling were investigated carefully. The reasonable size range of the blank shape was obtained. The conclusions above pave the theoretical foundation for the in-depth study on this technology...|$|R
50|$|A {{ball screw}} is a {{mechanical}} linear actuator that translates rotational motion to linear motion with little friction. A <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft</b> provides a helical raceway for ball bearings which {{act as a}} precision screw. As well as being able to apply or withstand high thrust loads, they can do so with minimum internal friction. They are made to close tolerances and are therefore suitable for use in situations in which high precision is necessary. The ball assembly acts as the nut while the <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft</b> is the screw.In contrast to conventional leadscrews, ballscrews tend to be rather bulky, due {{to the need to}} have a mechanism to re-circulate the balls.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of variations in thread shape on the axial pullout strength of orthodontic miniscrews. Methods: A total of 35 miniscrews, 7 of each design being considered, were tested by performing pullout tests on a synthetic bone support. We used self-tapping and self-drilling miniscrews having a diameter of 2 mm and a <b>thread</b> <b>shaft</b> length of 12 mm (the longest and the largest supplied by the manufacturer). A buttress reverse thread shape served as the control design and was tested against 4 experimental designs, each manufactured with a modification in thread shape while maintaining all other characteristics. The experimental groups had the following thread designs: buttress, 75 Â° joint profile, rounded, and trapezoidal. Results: The control group with a buttress reverse thread shape had consistently higher pullout strength values than did the other designs. A statistically significant reduction in pullout force was found between the buttress reverse and the buttress thread miniscrews. Conclusions: Thread design influenced the resistance to pullout of the orthodontic miniscrews. The buttress reverse thread shape provided the greatest pullout strength.

50|$|The term {{jackscrew}} is {{also used}} for the captive screws that draw the two parts of D-subminiature electrical connectors together and hold them mated. When unscrewed, they allow the connector halves to be taken apart. These small jackscrews may have ordinary screw heads or extended heads (also making them thumbscrews) that allow the user's fingers to turn the jackscrew. Furthermore, the head sometimes has an internal female thread, with the male externally <b>threaded</b> screw <b>shaft</b> extending from that.

50|$|Furniture cross dowel {{barrel nuts}} are {{cylindrical}} shaped metal nuts (metal dowels) used with furniture connector bolts to join {{two pieces of}} wood. The inside threaded hole is unusual in that it passes through {{the sides of the}} dowel. To install, the pieces of wood to be joined are aligned, then a bolt hole is drilled through one piece of wood and into the other. A dowel hole is drilled laterally across the bolt hole and the cross dowel is inserted into it. The end of the cross dowel is slotted so that a screwdriver can be inserted to rotate the dowel so that its <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft</b> aligns with the bolt hole. The furniture connector bolt is then inserted into the bolt hole and screwed into the cross dowel until the wood pieces are held tightly together.|$|E
50|$|A rod end bearing, {{also known}} as a heim joint (N. America) or rose joint (U.K. and elsewhere), is a {{mechanical}} articulating joint. Such joints are used on the ends of control rods, steering links, tie rods, or anywhere a precision articulating joint is required, and where a clevis end (which requires perfect 90 degree alignment between the attached shaft and the second component) is unsuitable. A ball swivel with an opening through which a bolt or other attaching hardware may pass is pressed into a circular casing with a <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft</b> attached. The threaded portion may be either male or female. The heim joint's advantage is that the ball insert permits the rod or bolt passing through it to be misaligned to a limited degree (an angle other than 90 degrees). A link terminated in two heim joints permits misalignment of their attached shafts (viz., other than 180 degrees) when used in tension. When used in compression, the through-rods are forced to the extreme ends of their ball's misalignment range, which cocks the link at an oblique angle.|$|E
5000|$|A Rzeppa joint (invented by Alfred H. Rzeppa in 1926) {{consists}} of a spherical inner shell with 6 grooves in it and a similar enveloping outer shell. Each groove guides one ball. The input shaft fits in the centre of a large, steel, star-shaped [...] "gear" [...] that nests inside a circular cage. The cage is spherical but with ends open, and it typically has six openings around the perimeter. This cage and gear fit into a grooved cup that has a splined and <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft</b> attached to it. Six large steel balls sit inside the cup grooves and fit into the cage openings, nestled in the grooves of the star gear. The output shaft on the cup then runs through the wheel bearing and is secured by the axle nut. This joint can accommodate the large changes of angle when the front wheels are turned by the steering system; typical Rzeppa joints allow 45Â°-48Â° of articulation, while some can give 54Â°. At the [...] "outboard" [...] end of the driveshaft a slightly different unit is used. The end of the driveshaft is splined and fits into the outer [...] "joint".

40|$|Due to high {{efficiency}} in helping breaking rocks, positive displacement motor has a widespread application {{in the field}} of oil and gas drilling engineering. However, service life of positive displacement motor becomes shorter resulting from failure of the driving <b>shaft</b> <b>thread.</b> The three-dimensional simulation model of driving <b>shaftâs</b> connecting <b>thread</b> has been developed based on the principle of virtual work, Von Mises yield criterion, and contact nonlinear theory.

40|$|In a {{proposed}} improvement of tooling for friction stir welding, gimballed shoulders would supplant shoulders that, heretofore, have been fixedly aligned with pins. The proposal is especially relevant to self-reacting friction stir welding. Some definitions of terms, recapitulated from related prior NASA Tech Briefs articles, are prerequisite to a meaningful {{description of the}} proposed improvement. In friction stir welding, one uses a tool that includes (1) a rotating shoulder on top (or front) of the workpiece and (2) a pin that rotates with the shoulder and protrudes from the shoulder into {{the depth of the}} workpiece. In conventional friction stir welding, the main axial force exerted by the tool on the workpiece is reacted through a ridged backing anvil under (behind) the workpiece. When conventional friction stir welding is augmented with an auto-adjustable pin-tool (APT) capability, the depth of penetration of the pin into the workpiece is varied in real time by a position- or forcecontrol system that extends or retracts the pin as needed to obtain the desired effect. In self-reacting (also known as self-reacted) friction stir welding as practiced heretofore, there are two shoulders: one on top (or front) and one on the bottom (or back) of the workpiece. In this case, a <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft</b> protrudes from the tip of the pin to beyond the back surface of the workpiece. The back shoulder is held axially in place against tension by a nut on the <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft.</b> Both shoulders rotate with the pin and remain aligned coaxially with the pin. The main axial force exerted on the workpiece by the tool and front shoulder is reacted through the back shoulder and the <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft</b> into the friction-stir-welding machine head, so that a backing anvil is no longer needed. A key transmits torque between the bottom shoulder and the <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft,</b> so that the bottom shoulder rotates with the shaft. This concludes the prerequisite definitions of terms...|$|E

5000|$|A screw is a {{mechanism}} that converts rotational motion to linear motion, and a torque (rotational force) to a linear force. [...] It {{is one of}} the six classical simple machines. The most common form consists of a cylindrical shaft with helical grooves or ridges called threads around the outside. [...] The screw passes through a hole in another object or medium, with threads {{on the inside of the}} hole that mesh with the screw's <b>threads.</b> When the <b>shaft</b> of the screw is rotated relative to the stationary threads, the screw moves along its axis relative to the medium surrounding it; for example rotating a wood screw forces it into wood. In screw mechanisms, either the screw shaft can rotate through a threaded hole in a stationary object, or a threaded collar such as a nut can rotate around a stationary screw shaft. [...] Geometrically, a screw can be viewed as a narrow inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder.|$|R
40|$|Additive manufacturing, more {{specifically}} 3 D printing using fused filament fabrication (FFF), {{is a valuable}} technique; however, little {{has been done in}} developing a new mechanism for driving filament through the hot end of the 3 D printer. This investigation focuses on a prototype extruder mechanism that utilizes two counter rotating motors to force filament through the nozzle. The plastic passes through the armateurs of the two motors and the oppositely-threaded shafts drive the filament while balancing each others torque. This design provides better protection against jamming of the nozzle. A bench top prototype was able to extrude filament at a rate much greater than traditional mechanisms allow, but the threads on the aluminum shafts wore down with very little use. An abrasive wear model of the extruder shafts was developed {{in order to determine the}} theoretical lifetime of the shafts given a certain material hardness. The wear rate of the shafts is proportional to the hardness of the material and the square of the velocity of the extruded filament. Based on this model as well as experiments done with various materials, it is estimated that steel shafts will have a lifetime that is 3 to 10 times longer than aluminum shafts. Still, this lifetime is still far too short for a part meant to be used 24 / 7. The wear on the <b>threads</b> of the <b>shafts</b> is so severe that no feasible material could survive an adequate lifetime before failure. by Joseph Sandoval. Thesis: S.
