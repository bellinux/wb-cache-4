Use is made of mini-tuft flow visualization and five hole probe pressure surveys. The results are compared with CFD simulations. The experiments were performed at the most important mission points of the D 8 : cruise, descent, start of climb, and <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb.</b> CFD was only performed for cruise and <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb.</b> From the pressure distributions the distortion coefficient, DC(60), was calculated, the maximum variation in pressure over a specified circumferential segment (60 °). At cruise the DC(60) equaled ~ 0. 3, compared to DC(60) ~ 0. 1 - 0. 2 for conventional aircraft. The D 8 model caused cross-flow to the propulsors, the flow is directed towards {{the sides of the}} model. Both fans rotate in the same direction, such that one propulsor has the flow in the direction of rotation, and the other has the flow opposite to the direction of rotation, causing an asymmetry between the left and right propulsor. The flight phase is characterized by ?, the angle of attack, ?, the ratio of tip velocity over tunnel speed, and ?, the yaw angle. It is found that at a high value of ? the pressure differences at the fan-face are reduced by engine suction, lowering the distortion and counter-acting the cross-flow. A low value of ? means a relative lower influence of the propulsor on the flow, such that the propulsor is not able to (fully) counter-act the cross-flow, resulting in a higher difference in DC(60) and power required between the left and right propulsor. Changing ? mainly changes the location of the pressure distributions. The results from experiments agree well with CFD, there is a 1 % deviation in DC(60) at <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> condition, and 6 % at cruise. The pressure distributions look similar and the pressure coefficient values scale equally, from - 0. 8 to 0. Further research should focus on the exact fan response on the distortion. The D 8 used conventional engines, optimized for uniform inflow. Developing a BLI optimized engine could further increase the BLI benefit. The D 8 model induced cross-flow, resulting in an asymmetry between the left and right engine. Eliminating this cross-flow by a change in model design could also decrease the distortion.

In the light of the performance of the future baseline engine, three radical cycles designed to reduce the observed major loss sources are introduced.

Previous research on this topic has concentrated on the analysis of the turbojet and the turbofan engine.

A striking strength of the analysis is that it establishes a common currency for comparing losses originating from very different physical sources of irreversibility. This substantially reduces the complexity of analyzing and comparing losses in aero engines. In particular, the analysis sheds new light on how the intercooled recuperated engine establishes its performance benefits...|$|E

40|$|Worldwide, the {{continuously}} growing {{air traffic}} induces {{a need for}} new ATM concepts to be defined. One possibility is using a more decentralized system predicated mainly around free routings (Free Flight), for a more flexible management of airspace. The present study first highlights the discrepancies and inefficiencies of the current best flightplan optimizing software that use the Cost Index concept before departure. It then investigates techniques to perform enhanced flight-plan optimizations en-route, with algorithms that are less complex than using the Cost Index. The long-haul flight leg that is considered through the simulations is London (UK) - Boston (MA, USA), flown on a constant flight level. This study shows that running another optimization at the <b>Top</b> <b>of</b> <b>Climb</b> point reduces the average delay at destination from 6. 9 minutes to 5. 0 minutes. Then, the more futuristic method of considering discrete flight-plan optimizations, while en-route using updated weather forecasts, provides results that are more interesting. If the weather forecasts and the optimizations are done simultaneously every 3 -hour or 1. 5 -hour, the average delay respectively becomes 2. 6 minutes or 2. 0 minutes.

40|$|NASA's Environmentally Responsible Aviation Project and Subsonic Fixed Wing Project {{are focused}} on {{developing}} concepts and technologies which may enable dramatic reductions to {{the environmental impact of}} future generation subsonic aircraft [1][2]. The open rotor concept (also referred to as the Unducted Fan or advanced turboprop) may allow the achievement of this objective by reducing engine emissions and fuel consumption. To evaluate its potential impact, an open rotor cycle modeling capability is needed. This paper presents the initial development of an open rotor cycle model in the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS) computer program which can then be used to evaluate the potential benefit of this engine. The development of this open rotor model necessitated addressing two modeling needs within NPSS. First, a method for evaluating the performance of counter-rotating propellers was needed. Therefore, a new counter-rotating propeller NPSS component was created. This component uses propeller performance maps developed from historic counter-rotating propeller experiments to determine the thrust delivered and power required. Second, several methods for modeling a counter-rotating power turbine within NPSS were explored. These techniques used several combinations of turbine components within NPSS to provide the necessary power to the propellers. Ultimately, a single turbine component with a conventional turbine map was selected. Using these modeling enhancements, an open rotor cycle model was developed in NPSS using a multi-design point approach. The multi-design point (MDP) approach improves the engine cycle analysis process by making it easier to properly size the engine to meet a variety of thrust targets throughout the flight envelope. A number of design points are considered including an aerodynamic design point, sea-level static, takeoff and <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb.</b> The development of this MDP model was also enabled by the selection of a simple power management scheme which schedules propeller blade angles with the freestream Mach number. Finally, sample open rotor performance results and areas for further model improvements are presented...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{demonstrates}} an aerodynamic and acoustic optimization methodology of a contra-rotating open rotor (CROR). The main {{challenge of the}} design effort undertaken was to improve the overall propulsive efficiency at <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> operating conditions {{while at the same}} time improving the acoustic characteristics at take-off or sideline conditions respectively. Apart from these global objectives, a number of constraints such as fulfilling thrust requirements at various flight regimes as well as basic mechanical criteria such as stress limitations to ensure a safe operation (in the present case for the test rig) needed to be respected and pose additional challenges for the design effort. However, both objectives were successfully met, which was confirmed by experiments. This was achieved by applying DLR’s multi-objective optimization procedure AutoOpti 6, which is based on an evolutionary algorithm, in combination with the DLR’s 3 D uRANS method TRACE 8. Appropriate cost functions for aerodynamics and basic acoustics were applied already within the design phase. The acoustic evaluation was carried out with a coupled uRANS and an analytic far field prediction method based on an integral Ffowcs-Williams Hawkings (FW-H) approach (APSIM 7). Both the aerodynamic and acoustic characteristics of several typical CROR configurations will be discussed by means of a coupled CFD/FW-H approach and corresponding experimental data taken in the WT 104 wind tunnel of TsAGI by both TsAGI and DLR. The main driver of the acoustic improvement will be discussed, here mainly in terms of a reduction of the wake velocity deficit of the front rotor. This wake strength reduction led to a decrease of the sum of the interaction tones over the entire directivity, here an average acoustic benefit of 3. 2 dB at sideline conditions for the optimized version was measured. Since all design efforts were undertaken neglecting the installation of the open rotor to the aircraft, the paper concludes with an assessment of the installation effect, here mainly on open rotor acoustic characteristic...|$|E

40|$|The {{reduction}} of CO 2 emissions is strongly {{linked with the}} improvement of engine specific fuel consumption, along with the {{reduction of}} engine nacelle drag and weight. One alternative design approach to improving specific fuel consumption is to consider a geared fan combined with an increased overall pressure ratio intercooled core performance cycle. The thermal benefits from intercooling have been well documented in the literature. Nevertheless, {{there is very little}} information available in the public domain with respect to design space exploration of such an engine concept when combined with a geared fan. The present work uses a multidisciplinary conceptual design tool to analyze the option of an intercooled core geared fan aero engine for long haul applications with a 2020 entry into service technology level assumption. With minimum mission fuel in mind, the results indicate as optimal values a pressure ratio split exponent of 0. 38 and an intercooler mass flow ratio of 1. 18 at hot-day <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>climb</b> conditions. At ISA midcruise conditions a specific thrust of 86 m/s, a jet velocity ratio of 0. 83, an intercooler effectiveness of 56 %, and an overall pressure ratio value of 76 are likely to be a good choice. A 70, 000 lbf intercooled turbofan engine is large enough to make efficient use of an all-axial compression system, particularly within a geared fan configuration, but intercooling is perhaps more likely to be applied to even larger engines. The proposed optimal jet velocity ratio is actually higher than the value one would expect by using standard analytical expressions, primarily because this design variable affects core efficiency at midcruise due to a combination of several different subtle changes to the core cycle and core component efficiencies at this condition. The analytical expressions do not consider changes in core efficiency and the beneficial effect of intercooling on transfer efficiency, nor do they account for losses in the bypass duct and jet pipe, while a relatively detailed engine performance model, such as the one utilized in this study, does. Mission fuel results from a surrogate model are in good agreement with the results obtained from a rubberized-wing aircraft model for some of the design parameters. This indicates {{that it is possible to}} replace an aircraft model with specific fuel consumption and weight penalty exchange rates. Nevertheless, drag count exchange rates have to be utilized to properly assess changes in mission fuel for those design parameters that affect nacelle diameter...|$|E
40|$|To {{conceive}} {{and assess}} engines with minimum global warming impact and lowest {{cost of ownership}} {{in a variety of}} emission legislation scenarios, emissions taxation policies, fiscal and Air Traffic Management environments a Techno economic and Environmental Risk Assessment (TERA) model is needed. In {{the first part of this}} thesis an approach is presented to estimate the cost of maintenance and the direct operating costs of turbofan engines of equivalent thrust rating, both for long and short range applications. The three advanced types of turbofan engines analysed here are a direct drive three spool with ultra high bypass ratio, a geared turbofan with the same fan as the direct drive engine and a turbofan with counter rotating fans. The baseline engines are a three spool for long range (Trent 772 b) and a two spool (CFM 56 - 7 b) for short range applications. The comparison with baseline engines shows the gains and losses of these novel cycle engines. The economic model is composed of three modules: a lifing module, an economic module and a risk module. The lifing module estimates the life of the high pressure turbine disk and blades through the analysis of creep and fatigue over a full working cycle of the engine. These two phenomena are usually the most limiting factors to the life of the engine. The output of this module is the amount of hours that the engine can sustain before its first overhaul (called time between overhauls). The value of life calculated by the lifing is then taken as the baseline distribution to calculate the life of other important modules of the engine using the Weibull approach. The Weibull formulation is applied to the life analysis of different parts of the engine in order to estimate the cost of maintenance, the direct operating costs (DOC) and net present cost (NPC) of turbofan engines. The Weibull distribution is often used in the field of life data analysis due to its flexibility—it can mimic the behavior of other statistical distributions such as the normal and the exponential. In the present work five Weibull distributions are used for five important sources of interruption of the working life of the engine: Combustor, Life Limited Parts (LLP), High Pressure Compressor (HPC), General breakdowns and High Pressure Turbine (HPT). The Weibull analysis done in this work shows the impact of the breakdown of different parts of the engine on the NPC and DOC, the importance that each module of the engine has in its life, and how the application of the Weibull theory can help us in the risk assessment of future aero engines. Then the lower of the values of life of all the distributions is taken as time between overhaul (TBO), and used into the economic module calculations. The economic module uses the time between overhaul together with the cost of labour and the cost of the engine (needed to determine the cost of spare parts) to estimate the cost of maintenance of the engine. The direct operating costs (DOC) of the engine are derived as a function of maintenance cost with the cost of taxes on emissions and noise, the cost of fuel, the cost of insurance and the cost of interests paid on the total investment. The DOC of the aircraft include also the cost of cabin and flight crew and the cost of landing, navigational and ground handling fees. With knowledge of the DOC the net present cost (NPC) for both the engine and the aircraft can be estimated over an operational period of about 30 years. The risk model uses the Monte Carlo method with a Gaussian distribution to study the impact of the variations in some parameters on the NPC. Some of the parameters considered in the risk scenarios are fuel price, interest percentage on total investment, inflation, downtime, maintenance labour cost and factors used in the emission and noise taxes. The risk analyses the influence of these variables for ten thousands scenarios and then a cumulative frequency curve is built by the model to understand the frequency of the most probable scenarios. After the conclusion of the analysis of the VITAL engines as they were specified by the Original Engine Manufacturer (OEM) (Roll – Royce, Snecma and MTU), an optimisation work was done in order to try to improve the engines. The optimisation was done using two numerical gradient based techniques Firstly the Sequential Quadratic Programming – NLPQL and secondly the Mixed Integer Optimization – MOST; the objectives of the optimisation were two: minimum fuel burn and minimum direct operating costs. Because the engines were already optimized for minimum fuel burn, the optimization for minimum fuel burn didn’t show any meaningful results; instead the results for minimum DOC showed that the engines can have some improvements. The ability of the three VITAL configurations to meet the future goals of the European Union to reduce noise and gaseous emission has been assessed and has showed that the three engines cannot fully comply with future legislation beyond 2020. In the second part of this thesis three further advanced configurations have been studied to determine whether these are potential solutions to meet the ACARE goals of 2020. For these more advanced aero engines only a performance and gaseous emissions analysis has been done, because it was no possible to do an economic analysis for the new components of these engines. These advanced configurations feature components that have been studied only in laboratories, like the heat exchangers for the ICR, the wave rotor and the constant volume combustor, and for these it has not been done a lifing analysis that is fundamental in order to understand the costs of maintenance, besides in order to do a proper direct operating costs analysis many operational flight hours are needed and none of these engine have reached TRL of 7 and more which is the stage where flight hour tests are conducted. In this thesis a parametric study on three different novel cycles which could be applied to aircraft propulsion is presented: 1. Intercooled recuperative, 2. wave rotor and 3. Constant volume combustion cycle. These three cycles have been applied to a characteristic next generation long range aero engine (geared turbofan) looking for a possible future evolution and searching for benefits on specific thrust fuel consumption and emissions. The parametric study has been applied to <b>Top</b> <b>of</b> <b>Climb</b> conditions, the design point, at Mach number 0. 82, ISA deviation of 10 degrees and an altitude of 10686 m and at cruise condition, considering two possible designs: a) Design for constant specific thrust and b) Design for constant TET or the current technology level Both values correspond to the baseline engine. For the intercooled engine also a weight and drag impact on fuel consumption has been done, in order to understand the impact of weight increase on the benefits of the configuration, considering different values of the effectiveness of the heat exchangers, the higher the values the greater is the technical challenge of the engine. After studying the CVC and Wave rotor separately it has been decided to do a parametric study of an aero engine that comprises both configurations: the internal combustion wave rotor (ICWR). The ICWR is a highly unsteady device, but offers significant advantages when combined with gas turbines. Since it is a constant volume combustion device there is a pressure raise during combustion, this will result in having lower SFC and higher thermal efficiency. It is an advanced and quite futuristic, with a technology readiness level (TRL) of 6 or higher only by 2025, so only a preliminary performance study is done, leaving to future studies the task of a more improved analysis.
