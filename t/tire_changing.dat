50|$|When {{the direct}} TPMS system is fitted {{at the factory}} the unique ID numbers of the TPM (tire {{pressure}} monitoring) sensors have to be registered along with their position on the vehicle with the tire pressure monitor ECU. This {{is also the case}} if any of the system components are subsequently changed e.g. in the event of rotating the <b>tires,</b> <b>changing</b> sensors, replacing the ECU etc.|$|R
50|$|<b>Changing</b> <b>tires</b> under caution was banned, {{under any}} circumstances. Any tire changed under caution (even {{if it was}} flat) {{resulted}} in a one lap penalty.|$|R
5000|$|Apart {{from the}} {{360-degree}} ballistic protection, the vehicles have a side and {{back door and}} an emergency exit {{on the roof and}} run flat <b>tires</b> for when <b>changing</b> a <b>tire</b> is not a viable option.|$|R
50|$|National and {{international}} standards {{have been developed}} to standardize the safety and performance requirements for jacks and other lifting devices. Selection of the standard is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, and has some significance {{in the design of the}} jack. In the United States, ASME has developed the Safety Standard for Portable Automotive Service Equipment, last revised in 2014, including requirements for hydraulic hand jacks, transmission jacks, emergency <b>tire</b> <b>changing</b> jacks, service jacks, fork lift jacks, and other lifting devices.|$|E
5000|$|Conceived, invented {{and built}} by Juliano, the Aurora was an 18 ft long fibreglass-bodied {{car that was}} two years {{on the drawing board}} and {{required}} three years to build. The high quality of the workmanship was [...] "astounding", particularly in the fibreglass body and the plastic windows. At a retail price of $12,000.00, it would have been priced just under the most costly car in the U.S., the $13,000.00 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham. The body, said to be dent, rust, and corrosion proof, was specifically designed for long distance highway travel. The vehicle had a tinted, transparent, plastic [...] "astrodome" [...] roof with adjustable interior metal shades. Dashboard controlled hydraulic jacks mounted in the frame assisted in <b>tire</b> <b>changing.</b> The spare tire, located under the front end, was mounted on a platform which would lower the tire to the ground without manual contact.|$|E
5000|$|The Davis Divan {{measured}} 183.5 in {{in length}} with a wheelbase of 109.5 in, which was remarkably {{long for a}} three-wheeled vehicle; it had a height of 60.0 in and weighed 2,450 lbs kg. With a width of 72.0 in, it was wide enough to seat four passengers abreast on its single bench seat; in fact, this feature had inspired {{the name of the}} car, which was the Arabic term for a couch or day bed. The car also featured a removable fiberglass top along with a steel chassis and chrome-trimmed aluminum body, which sported aircraft-inspired styling details, 15 in wheels, disc brakes, and hidden headlights. The Divan was built with a channel steel frame and 11 body panels made of aluminum and zinc, while the [...] "Baby" [...] prototype had instead been constructed with a tube steel space frame. The finished car boasted jacks built into each of its corners, which allowed for easier <b>tire</b> <b>changing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Penalties were severe: a 1-lap {{penalty for}} <b>changing</b> <b>tires</b> during caution or pitting {{with the wrong}} group (blue/orange). A 15-second penalty for {{overshooting}} the pit stall, or for crew members jumping over the wall too soon.|$|R
50|$|IMSA allows {{only four}} {{mechanics}} to service a car during a pit stop. One crew member will refuel the car {{while the other}} three are responsible for <b>changing</b> <b>tires</b> and operating the pneumatic jacks. A fifth crewmember must serve as the teams designated firefighter and must stand ready in the pit stall with a fire extinguisher while the car is being refuelled. A sixth crewmember may assist in a driver change. Neither the firefighter or driver's assistant may perform any additional service to the car itself. Unlike the ACO, IMSA does not force crews to wait for fuelling to complete before <b>changing</b> <b>tires,</b> and {{does not require the}} car's engine be shut off during the stop.|$|R

5000|$|As {{the head}} of the [...] "Rainbow Warriors" [...] pit crew (named for the {{colorful}} DuPont Automotive Finishes, now known as Axalta Coating Systems, scheme), Evernham {{is considered one of the}} innovators in improving the duration and efficiency of pit stops, the period where a driver receives new tires, fuel, repairs, and adjustments to the handling of the car. Instead of full-time mechanics acting as part-time pit crews, Evernham created a group of specialists (often former athletes) who would train to perfect their assigned task (<b>tire</b> <b>changing,</b> tire carrying, jacking up the car, etc...). Much like professional sports teams, Evernham incorporated choreography, put his crew members through strength and agility training, and analyzed pit stops on film between races to point out spots where his crew excelled or could improve. These methods led to the car spending less time in the pits, gaining spots on the race track. Evernham is credited with changing the expected duration of a 4-tire pit stop from over 20 seconds to less than 15.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Nowadays lots {{of effort}} {{have been done}} in EU-wide to enhance road safety. Huge effort has been done by vehicle {{manufacturers}} and road infrastructure managers. Very little is being known about vehicle owners and their role in road safety. Even less research has been done in season <b>tire</b> <b>changing.</b> In this paper author investigated the <b>tire</b> <b>changing</b> systems and their financial consequence. Firstly the accidental dataset were investigated secondly the financial consequence of season <b>tire</b> <b>changing</b> were analysed especially in Hungary. Findings in this study showed that tire related fatal road accidents become more and more significant in Hungary. Furthermore seasonally changed summer and winter tires are less expensive if proper usage is considered without overrunning. The harmful environmental effect of lower renewal interval of season tires are also mentioned...|$|E

50|$|In {{its normal}} {{interior}} configuration (with the back seats {{up and the}} parcel shelf in place) the rear cargo area does have a noticeably small opening (52 cm by 82 cm) and an elevated lip necessitating the lifting of luggage quite high {{before it can be}} placed inside. However the boot (trunk) is relatively deep and spacious. In addition the rear seats fold down and both the parcel shelf and the rear divider panel (usually in place behind the back seats) can be completely removed, in essence turning the entire rear half of the car into a cargo area. As such the Toyota Sera has a large amount of available storage space for its size. The space-saving spare <b>tire</b> and <b>changing</b> kit are contained in a small compartment below the boot floor.|$|R

50|$|Two {{practice}} sessions was held before the Saturday race—both on Friday. The first session lasted 120 minutes, {{while the second}} session lasted 45 minutes. During the first practice session, David Gilliland was fastest, ahead of Robby Gordon and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in second and third respectively. Jeff Gordon was scored fourth, while A. J. Allmendinger was placed fifth, even though the latter had spun sideways twice in the session. In the second and final practice session, Ryan Newman was scored quickest, as Carl Edwards and Gilliland followed {{in the second and}} third positions. Jimmie Johnson was scored in the fourth position, while his teammate Jeff Gordon followed in fifth.50 cars were entered for qualifying, due NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only 43 could race. Johnson clinched his twenty-fourth career pole position, with a time of 15.540 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Edwards. Joey Logano qualified third, Tony Stewart took fourth, and David Reutimann started fifth. Six drivers did not qualify because one team, the second car for Tommy Baldwin Racing, withdrew from qualifying. They were Dave Blaney, Joe Nemechek, Kevin Lepage, J. J. Yeley, Brian Keselowski, and Mike Bliss. Also during qualifying, Jeff Gordon spun sideways and flattened his <b>tires,</b> but after <b>changing</b> <b>tires,</b> he qualified twenty-sixth.|$|R
2500|$|In 1986 {{the group}} {{changed its name}} to Saver Tiger to avoid {{confusion}} with a similarly named band from Sapporo (see Saber Tiger). Their first appearance with the new name was on the sampler Devil Must Be Driven out with Devil, with their songs [...] "Dead Angle" [...] and [...] "Emergency Express". They continued to perform in live houses and night clubs such as Meguro Rokumeikan, Omiya Freaks and Meguro Live Station. Until January 28, 1987, when hide became <b>tired</b> of <b>changing</b> members and decided to end the band (vocalist Kyo and drummer Tetsu would both go on to D'erlanger). Around the same time hide was invited to join X. In 2001, Nippon Crown issued a three-volume release titled Origin of hide, with the band credited as [...] "Yokosuka Saver Tiger". Volumes 1 and 2 were live CDs, with some rehearsal recordings, while volume 3 was a concert VHS.|$|R

50|$|The Wood Brothers {{invented the}} modern pit stop. In {{the early days}} of all types of motorracing (when service was needed during the race), it was common for drivers to pull into the pits, turn off the car, get out and even smoke a {{cigarette}} as the crew took their time <b>changing</b> <b>tires</b> and servicing the cars. The Wood Brothers recognized that by limiting the time off the track, it could increase their position on the track. Thus, they created and perfected what is now known as the pit stop. It is as common to all types of racing as the checkered flag itself.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} forms of racing, the {{practice}} of [...] "double-stinting" [...] or even [...] "triple-stinting" [...] tires is commonplace in longer races; tires hard enough to withstand the rigours of racing {{in the heat of}} the daytime may be so hard that they do not wear significantly during the nighttime hours. In a race where this is an issue, significant time can be gained by choosing to leave worn tires on the car during the first stop after they were put on the car; if the temperature drops low enough, teams may even be able to go two pit stops without <b>changing</b> <b>tires.</b>|$|R
