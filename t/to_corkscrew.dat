40|$|A unique {{application}} of the pulsed-wire measurement method has been implemented for alignment of 2. 5 T pulsed solenoid magnets. The magnetic axis measurement {{has been shown to}} have a resolution of better than 25 {micro}m. The accuracy of the technique allows for the identification of inherent field errors due to, for example, the winding layer transitions and the current leads. The alignment system is developed for the induction accelerator NDCX-II under construction at LBNL, an upgraded Neutralized Drift Compression experiment for research on warm dense matter and heavy ion fusion. Precise alignment is essential for NDCX-II, since the ion beam has a large energy spread associated with the rapid pulse compression such that misalignments lead <b>to</b> <b>corkscrew</b> deformation of the beam and reduced intensity at focus. The ability to align the magnetic axis of the pulsed solenoids to within 100 pm of the induction cell axis has been demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} tidal {{circulation in}} an elongated basin of arbitrary depth is described with a linear, constant-density model on the f plane. Rotation fundamentally alters the lateral flow, introducing a lateral recirculation comparable in magnitude to the axial flow, {{as long as}} friction is not too large. This circulation {{is due to the}} imbalance between the cross-channel sea level gradient, which is in near-geostrophic balance with the Coriolis acceleration associated with the vertically averaged axial flow, and the Coriolis accelera-tion associated with the vertically sheared axial flow. During flood condition, for example, the lateral Coriolis acceleration near the surface exceeds the pressure gradient, tending to accelerate the lateral flow, while the converse is true near the bottom. As a result, with rotation, fluid parcels tend <b>to</b> <b>corkscrew</b> {{into and out of the}} basin in a tidal period. The axial flow is only weakly modified by rotation. When friction is small, the axial velocity is uniform in each section, except in a narrow bottom boundary layer where it decreases to zero. The boundary layer thickness increases with friction, so that with moderate or large friction, axial velocities are sheared from bottom to surface. When friction is large, the local and Coriolis accelerations are both small and the dynamics are governed by a balance between friction and the pressure gradient. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the frequency and distribution of lesions and/or diseases associated with lameness problems in commercial dairy herds with Holstein cows, in Baja California, Mexico, a two stage transverse epidemiological study was carried out in 592 milking cows with frequent lameness. During the first stage, a locomotion scoring method (LS), index that measures the cow?s capacity to walk was used. Cows were observed during milking assigning to each a score of 1 to 5, where LS 1 represents a normal cow and LS 5 represents cases of severe lameness. Results gave a 17. 5 % frequency of evident and severe lameness. During the second stage of this study, 37. 5 % (39 / 104) of the cows that had these scores (LS 4 and LS 5) were randomly selected and carefully inspected in order to detect and classify severe pathologies. In total, 89 lesions were detected; of these, 36 % were linked to white line disease; 27 % to double sole; 15. 7 % <b>to</b> <b>corkscrew</b> claw; 6. 8 % to fissures (vertical and horizontal); the remaining lesions (14. 5 %) were associated with abscess and talon ulcer cases, as well as digital and interdigital dermatitis. In conclusion, the high frequency of white line disease and double sole in the region may be mainly associated to two factors: diet formula and the lack of a routine preventive hoof trimming program...|$|E
40|$|Kolchin, PeterThe {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{document}} the lives, before, {{during and after the}} Civil War, of African American Veterans of that war, members of the United States Colored Troop (USCT) regiments all, who were in some way related to Cecil County, Maryland. Either they were born there, lived there, were employed there, died there, and/or were buried there. While some of the subject veterans began their lives in slavery, most were born free. During the war they enlisted in the Union Army and fought at The Crater, Deep Bottom, The Gap, Petersburg, Richmond, and the last scene of the Civil War, the Confederate surrender at Appomattox Court House, all in Virginia. They marched through Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas, Florida, and Texas. They fought, they were wounded, and they lost limbs. At least four were killed in action, several more died of diseases that ravaged their military encampments, and a few have their final resting places in the cemeteries of the various black churches that dot the landscape of Cecil County, Maryland. After the war they blended into society raising families, educating their children, buying and selling land, mortgaging that land, and becoming laborers, farmers, sextons, brickmakers, carters, and one restauranteur.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{and characteristics}} of the marine component of sea breeze cells have received little attention relative to their onshore counterparts. Yet {{there is a growing}} interest and dependence on the offshore wind climate from, for example, a wind energy perspective. Using idealized model experiments, we investigate the sea breeze circulation at scales which approximate to those of the southern North Sea, a region of major ongoing offshore wind farm development. We also contrast the scales {{and characteristics of}} the pure and the little known corkscrew and backdoor sea breeze types, where the type is pre-defined by the orientation of the synoptic scale flow relative to the shoreline. We find, crucially, that pure sea breezes, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>corkscrew</b> and backdoor types, can lead to substantial wind speed reductions offshore and that the addition of a second eastern coastline emphasises this effect through generation of offshore "calm zones". The offshore extent of all sea breeze types is found to be sensitive to both the influence of Coriolis acceleration and to the boundary layer scheme selected. These extents range, for example for a pure sea breeze produced in a 2 m s&minus; 1 offshore gradient wind, from 0 km to 21 km between the Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino and the Yonsei State University schemes respectively. The corkscrew type restricts the development of a backdoor sea breeze on the opposite coast and is also capable of traversing a 100 km offshore domain even under high along-shore gradient wind speed (> 15 m s&minus; 1 ) conditions. Realistic variations in sea surface skin temperature and initializing vertical thermodynamic profile do not significantly alter the resulting circulation, though the strengths of the simulated sea breezes are modulated if the effective land-sea thermal contrast is altered. We highlight how sea breeze impacts on circulation need to be considered in order to improve the accuracy of both assessments of the offshore wind energy climate and forecasts of wind energy output...|$|E
40|$|The Heavy Ion Fusion Science Virtual National Laboratory in the USA is {{constructing}} a new Neutralized Drift Compression eXperiment (NDCX-II) at LBNL. This facility {{is being developed}} for high energy density physics and inertial fusion energy research. The 12 m long induction linac in NDCX-II will produce a Li{sup +} beam pulse, at energies of 1. 2 - 3 MeV, to heat target material to the warm dense matter regime ({approx} 1 eV). By making use of special acceleration voltage waveforms, 2. 5 T solenoid focusing, and neutralized drift compression, 20 - 50 nC of beam charge from the ion source will be compressed longitudinally and radially to achieve a subnanosecond pulse length and mm-scale target spot size. The original Neutralized Drift Compression Experiment (NDCX-I) has successfully demonstrated simultaneous radial and longitudinal compression by imparting a velocity ramp to the ion beam, which then drifts in a neutralizing plasma to and through the final focussing solenoid and onto the target. At higher kinetic energy and current, NDCX-II will offer more than 100 times the peak energy fluence on target of NDCX-I. NDCX-II makes use of many parts from the decommissioned Advanced Test Accelerator (ATA) at LLNL. It includes 27 lattice periods between the injector and the neutralized drift compression section (Figure 1). There are 12 energized induction cells, 9 inactive cells which provide drift space, and 6 diagnostic cells which provide beam diagnostics and pumping. Custom pulsed power systems generate ramped waveforms for the first 7 induction cells, so as to quickly compress the beam from 600 ns at the injector down to 70 ns. After this compression, the high voltages of the ATA Blumleins are then used to rapidly add energy to the beam. The Blumleins were designed to match the ferrite core volt-seconds with pulses up to 250 kV and a fixed FWHM of 70 ns. The machine {{is limited to a}} pulse repetition rate of once every 20 seconds due to cooling requirements. The NDCX-II beam is highly space-charge dominated. The 1 -D ASP code was used to synthesize high voltage waveform for acceleration, while the 3 -D Warp particle-in-cell code was used for detailed design of the lattice. The Li{sup +} ion was chosen because its Bragg Peak energy (at {approx} 2 MeV) coincides with the NDCX-II beam energy. The 130 keV injector will have a 10. 9 cm diameter ion source. Testing of small (0. 64 cm diameter) lithium doped alumino-silicate ion sources has demonstrated the current density ({approx} 1 mA/cm{sup 2 }) used in the design, with acceptable lifetime. A 7. 6 cm diameter source has been successfully produced to verify that the coating method can be applied to such a large emitting area. The ion source will operate at {approx} 1275 C; thus a significant effort was made in the design to manage the 4 kW heating power and the associated cooling requirements. In modifying the ATA induction cells for NDCX-II, the low-field DC solenoids were replaced with 2. 5 T pulsed solenoids. The beam pipe diameter was decreased {{in order to reduce the}} axial extent of the solenoid fringe fields and to make room for water cooling. In addition, an outer copper cylinder (water-cooled) was used to exclude the solenoid magnetic flux from the ferrite cores. Precise alignment is essential because the beam has a large energy spread due to the rapid pulse compression, such that misalignments lead <b>to</b> <b>corkscrew</b> deformation of the beam and reduced intensity at focus. A novel pulsed-wire measurement method is used to align the pulsed solenoid magnets. Alignment accuracy has been demonstrated to within 100 {micro}m of the induction cell axis. The neutralized drift compression region after the last induction cell is approximately 1. 2 m long and includes ferroelectric plasma sources (FEPS) fabricated by PPPL similar to those successfully operating in NDCX-I. The 8 -T final focus pulsed solenoid, filtered cathodic arc plasma sources (FCAPS), and target chamber from NDCX-I are to be relocated to NDCX-II. The NDCX-II project started in July 2009 and is expected to complete in fall of 2011. As future funds become available, additional induction cells and pulsed power systems will be added to increase the beam energy...|$|E
