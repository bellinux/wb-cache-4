25|$|Due to {{the initial}} demand from U.S. air carriers, Boeing sold the first 60 247s, an {{unprecedented}} $3.5 million order, to its affiliated airline, Boeing Air <b>Transport</b> (<b>part</b> of the United Aircraft and Transport Corporation, UATC), at a unit price of $65,000. TWA (Transcontinental & Western Air) also ordered the 247 but UATC declined the order, which resulted in TWA President Jack Frye setting out the requirements for a new airliner and funding Don Douglas to design and build the Douglas DC-1 prototype. Douglas eventually developed the design into the historic and enormously successful DC-3 line.|$|E

60|$|Washington now {{ordered that}} all the vessels and river craft, not {{required}} at Albany, should be sent down to New Windsor and Fishkill, and kept in readiness; for he knew not how soon the movements of General Howe might render it suddenly necessary to <b>transport</b> <b>part</b> of his forces up the Hudson.|$|E
60|$|On the 2d of August, Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral Digby wrote a joint {{letter to}} Washington, informing {{him that they}} were acquainted, by authority, that {{negotiations}} for a general peace had already been commenced at Paris, and that {{the independence of the}} United States would be proposed in the first instance by the British commissioner, instead of being made a condition of a general treaty. Even yet, Washington was wary. No offers had been made on the part of Great Britain for a general cessation of hostilities, and, although the British commanders were in a manner tied down by the resolves of the House of Commons, to a defensive war, only in the United States, they might be at liberty to <b>transport</b> <b>part</b> of their force to the West Indies, to act against the French possessions in that quarter. With these considerations he wrote to the Count de Rochambeau, then at Baltimore, advising him, {{for the good of the}} common cause, to march his troops to the banks of the Hudson, and form a junction with the American army. The junction took place about the middle of September. The French army crossed the Hudson at King's Ferry to Verplanck's Point, where the American forces were paraded under arms to welcome them.|$|E

50|$|Ekman <b>transport,</b> <b>part</b> of Ekman motion theory first {{investigated}} in 1902 by Vagn Walfrid Ekman, {{is the term}} given for the 90° net transport of the surface layer of a fluid (the layer affected by wind) by wind forcing. This phenomenon was first noted by Fridtjof Nansen, who recorded that ice transport appeared to occur {{at an angle to}} the wind direction during his Arctic expedition during the 1890s. The direction of transport is dependent on the hemisphere: in the northern hemisphere, transport occurs at 90° clockwise from wind direction, while in the southern hemisphere it occurs at a 90° counterclockwise.|$|E

50|$|Energy {{savings that}} can be {{achieved}} with ATES are strongly depending on the geology of a site. Mainly, ATES requires the presence of a suitable aquifer that is able to accept and yield water. Therefore, thick (>10 m) sandy aquifers are selected. Natural groundwater flow may <b>transport</b> (<b>part</b> of) the stored energy outside of the capture zone of a well during the storage phase. To reduce advective heat loss, aquifers with a low hydraulic gradient are preferred. In addition, gradients in geochemical composition should be avoided, as mixing of water with different geochemistry can increase clogging, which will reduce the performance of a well and lead to increased maintenance costs.|$|E

Mount Vernon was the lead ship in Operation Stepsister, the movement of Australian troops from North Africa and the Middle East to Southeast Asia, the Dutch East Indies and Australia in response to war in the Pacific, and was carrying 4,668 of those troops in waters south of the Dutch East Indies even as allied naval forces were withdrawing {{in the face of}} Japanese attacks.
