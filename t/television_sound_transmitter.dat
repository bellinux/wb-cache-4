40|$|The <b>television</b> <b>sound</b> {{is going}} through major changes. Analogue <b>television</b> <b>sound</b> has been broadcasted one-way – from {{broadcaster}} to receiver {{and the idea of}} broadcasting has been top-down. Now digitalization of <b>television</b> <b>sound</b> is going to change from receiving to using and adjust. The purpose of this text is to show what kind of sound applications there will be as available in future television. The digital television has good possibilities to offer several types of sound services. This paper is a part of my dissertation about <b>television</b> <b>sound</b> moving towards new media. The Stationary Sound Applications and Mobile Sound Applications are the most central issues when <b>television</b> <b>sound</b> is going from analogue to digital...|$|R

When the transmitter and receiver are separated it is bistatic operation. When more transmitters (or more receivers) are used, again spatially separated, it is multistatic operation. Most sonars are used monostatically with the same array often being used for transmission and reception. Active sonobuoy fields may be operated multistatically.|$|R

50|$|CKVR {{previously}} operated low-power rebroadcast transmitters in {{the communities}} of Parry Sound, Huntsville and Haliburton, respectively on VHF channels 11, 8 and 5. The Parry <b>Sound</b> <b>transmitter</b> moved to VHF channel 12 in the mid-1970s before Kitchener CTV station CKCO-TV (channel 13) opened a rebroadcast transmitter in Huntsville on channel 11. The Haliburton transmitter was located very close to another CBC affiliate transmitter, CHEX-TV in Peterborough, located at Minden and broadcasting on channel 7. The channel 5 transmitter was shut down when Toronto's CBLT moved from channel 6 to channel 5, and became largely redundant {{as a result of}} CKVR's increased transmission tower height in the early 1970s. The Huntsville transmitter increased to full power in 1991 to better cover much of Muskoka and Haliburton County; it was bought by the CBC in 1995 as part of CKVR's disaffiliation from the CBC, and became a rebroadcaster of CBLT (remaining in operation until CBC shut down its analogue rebroadcasters in July 2012). CKVR kept its Parry <b>Sound</b> <b>transmitter,</b> and CBC established CBLT transmitters in Barrie and Parry Sound at that time, on channels 16 and 18, respectively.|$|R
