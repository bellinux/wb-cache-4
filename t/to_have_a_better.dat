5|$|There {{are many}} traditions {{associated}} with the Stanley Cup. One of the oldest, started by the 1896 Winnipeg Victorias, dictates that the winning team drink champagne from the top bowl after their victory. The Cup is also traditionally presented on the ice to {{the captain of the}} winning team after the series-winning game; each member of the victorious club carries the trophy around the rink. However, this has not always been the case; prior to the 1930s, the Cup was not awarded immediately after the victory. The first time that the Cup was awarded on the ice may have been to the 1932 Toronto Maple Leafs, but the practice did not become a tradition until the 1950s. Ted Lindsay of the 1950Cup champion Detroit Red Wings became the first captain, upon receiving the Cup, to hoist it overhead and skate around the rink. According to Lindsay, he did so to allow the fans <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> view of the Cup. Since then, it has been a tradition for each member of the winning team, beginning with the captain, to take a lap around the ice with the trophy hoisted above his head.|$|E

25|$|In {{comparison}} to monolinguals, bilinguals have shown <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> recovery after stroke. As with Alzheimer's patients, bilingual {{patients who have}} suffered an ischemic stroke have shown <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> cognitive outcome which researchers believe {{is due to a}} higher cognitive reserve. This increase of cognitive reserve might be attributed to the increase of grey matter in bilingual individuals. Since bilingual individuals have to constantly change and inhibit a language, the brain is more used to brain training and has been able to optimize better the space it uses. Brain training has led researchers to believe is a factor that helps stroke patients recover faster and better. Bilingual individuals then are able to benefit more from rehabilitation after stroke compared to monolingual patients because the brain has a higher plasticity ability that allows for a better remodeling of the brain after stroke. Stroke patients (bilinguals) with aphasia also perform better in other cognitive tasks that measure attention and ability to organize and retrieve information. This is attributed again to the increase of grey matter since it is involved in cognitive control and higher cognitive functions that are more present in bilinguals. This is relevant since in some patients the automatization of language is impaired, highly correlated to basal ganglia lesions and anterior parietal cortex. Although it is uncommon for patients to lose automatization of the first language, basal ganglia lesions have been correlated to loss of automatization of language, which fits with the role of basal ganglia in automatized motor and cognitive performance. This is more evident with patients who have acquired a second language at a later age since studies suggest that late bilingual aphasics' syntactic judgment abilities may be more impaired for the second language. Acquisition of language at a later age changes the mapping of language in the brain since the languages do not overlap. This difference in mapping seems to be a contributing factor in recovery for patients with bilingual aphasia since there are second language-restricted zones that are dedicated to the first language.|$|E
25|$|The {{other two}} branches, the Manchukuo Imperial Air Force and the Manchukuo Imperial Navy, {{were small and}} underdeveloped, largely {{existing}} as token forces to give legitimacy to the Manchukuo regime. An Air Force was established in February 1937 with 30 men selected from the Manchukuo Imperial Army who were trained at the Japanese Kwantung Army aircraft arsenal in Harbin (initially the Kwantung Army did not trust the Manchukuoans enough to train a native air force for them). The Imperial Air Force's predecessor was the Manchukuo Air Transport Company (later renamed the Manchukuo National Airways), a paramilitary airline formed in 1931, which undertook transport and reconnaissance missions for the Japanese military. The first air unit was based in Hsinking (Changchun) and equipped with just one Nieuport-Delage NiD 29 and was later expanded with Nakajima Army Type 91 Fighters and Kawasaki Type 88 light bombers. Two more air units were established, but they suffered a setback when one hundred pilots took their aircraft and defected to insurgents after murdering their Japanese instructors. Nonetheless three fighter squadrons were formed in 1942 from the first batch of cadets, being equipped with Nakajima Ki-27 fighters in addition to Tachikawa Ki-9s and Tachikawa Ki-55 trainers, along with some Mitsubishi Ki-57 transports. In 1945, because of American bombing raids, they were issued with Nakajima Ki-43 fighters <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> chance of intercepting B-29 Superfortresses. Some pilots saw action against the American bombers {{and at least one}} Ki-27 pilot downed a B-29 by ramming his plane into it in a kamikaze attack. The air force practically ceased to exist by the Soviet invasion but there were isolated instances of Manchukuoan planes attacking Soviet forces. The Imperial Navy of Manchukuo existed mainly as a small river flotilla and consisted mainly of small gunboats and patrol boats, both captured Chinese ships and some Japanese additions. The elderly Japanese destroyer Kashi was lent to the Manchukuoan fleet from 1937 to 1942 as the Hai Wei before returning to the Imperial Japanese Navy. These ships were mostly crewed by Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Following the turnover, Michigan {{started on}} its own four-yard line. Fitzgerald Toussaint ran for six yards, and Robinson {{followed}} with a 16-yard run. Michigan's offense stalled on its next three plays forcing a punt. On the punt, however, Tech committed a roughing the kicker penalty that gave Michigan 15 yards and an automatic first down. Toussaint ran the ball for a two-yard gain, and Michigan called a timeout. Following the timeout, Robinson rushed for five yards and then completed a 14-yard pass to Toussaint for a first down at the Tech 38-yard line. Robinson was sacked on the next play for a loss of seven yards and then threw an incompletion to make it third-and-seventeen. On the next play, however, Robinson threw a 45-yard touchdown pass to Junior Hemingway that saw Hemingway reach around a Tech defender to make the original catch, and then sprint into the endzone. Brendan Gibbons added the extra point to give Michigan a 7–6 lead. On the ensuing kickoff, Tech's Tony Gregory returned the ball 27 yards, however, Michigan's J.B. Fitzgerald forced a fumble that Michigan's Delonte Hollowell recovered at Tech's 26-yard line. Gallon rushed for seven yards on the first play before Robinson threw two incomplete passes. Michigan brought out Gibbons to attempt a field goal, however, Michigan attempted a fake field goal that saw Michigan's long snapper Jareth Glanda make a catch for 11 yards after the ball hit a Virginia Tech defender in the head. With eight seconds remaining in the half, Robinson threw a seven-yard screen pass to Vincent Smith, which moved {{the ball to the}} Tech one-yard line.

500|$|Differences in {{the bodies}} of {{children}} and adults lead to different manifestations of pulmonary contusion and associated injuries; for example, children have less body mass, so the same force {{is more likely to}} lead to trauma in multiple body systems. [...] Since their chest walls are more flexible, children are more vulnerable to pulmonary contusion than adults are, and thus suffer from the injury more commonly. Pulmonary contusion has been found in 53% of children with chest injuries requiring hospitalization. Children in forceful impacts suffer twice as many pulmonary contusions as adults with similar injury mechanisms, yet have proportionately fewer rib fractures. [...] The rates of certain types of injury mechanisms differ between children and adults; for example, children are more often hit by cars as pedestrians.
