As a builder, McLaughlin was in an advantageous position to have his own house built and Ipswich Municipal Council Valuation Registers indicate that a brick cottage and workshop existed on the allotment in Burnett Street as early as 1863.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Tenders</b> <b>for</b> {{construction}} <b>work</b> on Highway 11 in 2008 {{amounted to}} $63.3 million of which $30 million saw 35 km twinned between Prince Albert and Saskatoon.

Notwithstanding {{the threat of the}} penalty for late completion, it was not until 21 January 1902 that an acceptable tender was confirmed, in the amount of £201,316, a considerable escalation on the estimated cost, and in addition it was necessary to apply for an extension of the permitted time.|$|R
25|$|ILLA {{concern for}} other labour issues {{developed}} after the Local Government Act transferred responsibility for cottage building, land reclamation, drainage, road building, their repair and maintenance, to the County and District Councils. This called for considerable ILLA involvement {{when it came}} to <b>tenders</b> <b>for</b> contract <b>work</b> and the fair employment of local contractors and labour, settling disputes and complaints, often arising out of local political patronage. The situation of previously evicted tenants, now reduced to landless labourers, was also on their agenda.|$|R

50|$|In {{the years}} after {{the opening of the}} {{building}} the service expanded and by 1929 an extension was thought to be urgently required. The Council were granted permission to borrow £2,000 to carry out the building in April 1930 and in March 1931 <b>tenders</b> <b>for</b> the <b>work</b> were accepted. The building work was carried out by John Heap and Sons of St Anne's and the constructional steelwork by John Booth and Sons of Hulton Steelworks, Bolton. The extension was opened on 25 September 1932 and a reorganised lending department opened on 9 October 1931.|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{potential}} for destruction of significant remains, PPG 16 prefers evaluation to take place in advance of any planning decision being made. A developer <b>tenders</b> <b>for</b> the <b>work</b> to be done and chooses an archaeological organization to retain. The work is monitored by a curator, normally the County Archaeologist, who is nominated by the local planning authority as an adviser and who also identifies sites where archaeology might be threatened by development. Following submission of a satisfactory site report and demonstration that a site's archaeological potential has been properly safeguarded and/or recorded, the curator will usually advise that development can continue.|$|R

50|$|In 1914 an {{extension}} of the western wing was added to designs of local architects, Dornbusch and Connolly, who designed the second St Mary's Church in Warwick (1929). <b>Tenders</b> <b>for</b> this <b>work</b> were called in December 1912. The painting and decorating was by Mr Donald Crawford in this extension. Sandstone used for this extension was from Campbell's Gully. This work was undertaken to meet the newly introduced State High School provisions (1912), which required extra subjects and, therefore, extra rooms, to allow the students to graduate. It is thought that dormer windows were added to the roof of the building, providing natural lighting to the attic at about this time.|$|R
50|$|In late September 2010, Manoora {{and sister}} ship Kanimbla {{were brought to}} Fleet Base East for an 'operational pause' after several {{problems}} were identified with the ships. These included large quantities of corrosion, faults with the deck crane and alarm system, overhauls of the propulsion, power generators, and air-conditioning, and upgrades to the communication suite. The ships were to be confined to base until after the ships complete a dry-docking initially valued at A$17 million: as of October 2010, <b>tenders</b> <b>for</b> the <b>work</b> were yet to be released. The problems {{have been attributed to}} the ship's high operational tempo, delays in maintenance, and the age of the ships.|$|R
5000|$|Of {{the three}} {{contractors}} approached by Moorhouse to <b>tender</b> <b>for</b> the <b>work,</b> the two lowest priced were discounted, leaving the highest tender, that of Holmes & Richardson.

He travelled to Canterbury with Moorhouse where he signed the contract. The cost of the tunnel works agreed to was £188,727, or complete with portals, £195,000. This compared with Smith & Knight's figures <b>for</b> the same <b>work</b> of £183,051 and £190,551 respectively. During the course of the contract, improvements to the Lyttelton portal were agreed at an additional cost of £5,000.|$|R
