5|$|Ryouta, {{searching for}} a way into the medical center basement, seeks out Nageki in the library <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> his death. Upon {{discovering}} documents revealing that Operation Hatoful was a Hawk Party project into developing biological weapons for use against humans using the school as an experimental facility—with a focus on a strain of H5N1 almost immediately lethal to humans dubbed the Charon virus—Nageki recalls that the fire was caused by his committing suicide by self-immolation after months of forced experimentation in order to destroy and remove any trace of the virus, which was isolated in his body, and that researchers often went in through the chemistry preparation room. Ryouta, Kazuaki, and Anghel {{make their way into}} the medical center's basement through the chemistry lab and encounter Labor 9, electrocuting it using a stun gun given to Ryouta earlier by Mister One. They confront Shuu, who imprisons Kazuaki and Anghel, leaving them to die of poison gas before leading Ryouta away. Meanwhile, San comforts Sakuya, {{and the two of them}} arrive to break Anghel and Kazuaki out of the prison.|$|E
5|$|In May 1851 Metternich {{left for}} his Johannisberg estate, {{which he had}} last visited in 1845. That summer Metternich enjoyed the company of Prussian {{representative}} Otto von Bismarck. He also enjoyed a visit from Frederick William, though the King irritated Metternich by appearing to cultivate him as a tool against Schwarzenberg. In September Metternich returned to Vienna, entertained along the way by various German princes keen to entertain the focus of Prussian intrigue. Metternich was reinvigorated, dropped his nostalgia, and lived in the present {{for the first time}} in a decade. Franz Josef asked for his advice on numerous issues (though he was too headstrong to be much influenced by it), and both of the two emerging factions in Vienna courted Metternich; even Tsar Nicholas called on him during a state visit. Metternich was not keen on the new Foreign Minister, Karl Ferdinand von Buol but thought him sufficiently incompetent that he would be impressionable. Metternich's advice was of varying quality; nonetheless, some of it was usefully insightful, even in modern issues. Now deaf, Metternich wrote endlessly, particularly for an appreciative Franz Josef. He wanted Austrian neutrality in the Crimean War, though Buol did not. In the meantime Metternich's health was slowly failing, and he was a more peripheral figure after the death of his wife Melanie in January 1854. In a brief resurgence of energy in early 1856, he busied himself in arrangements for a marriage between his son Richard and his granddaughter Pauline (Richard's step-sister's daughter) and undertook more travel. The King of the Belgians came to visit, as did Bismarck, and on 16 August 1857 he entertained the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom. Buol, however, was growing more resentful of Metternich's advice, particularly about Italy. In April 1859 Franz Josef came <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> what should be done in Italy. According to Pauline, Metternich begged him not to send an ultimatum to Italy, and Franz Josef explained that such an ultimatum had already been sent.|$|E

25|$|On 22 May 2003, at the Charing Cross Hotel in London, Kelly met Andrew Gilligan, a BBC {{journalist}} {{who had spent}} some time writing {{about the war in}} Baghdad. Kelly was anxious to learn what had happened in Iraq, while Gilligan, who had discussed a very early draft of the dossier with Kelly, wished <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> it in light of the failure to find any weapons of mass destruction. They agreed to talk on an unattributable basis, which allowed the BBC to report what was said but not to identify the source. Kelly told Gilligan of his concerns over the 45-minute claim and allegedly ascribed its inclusion in the dossier to Alastair Campbell, the director of communications for Tony Blair.|$|E

Coulson promises to get Morrow released if he cooperates, but Morrow refuses. Outside the prison, Morrow's nephew Robbie Reyes arrives to also ask his uncle about Momentum, but agent Alphonso [...] "Mack" [...] MacKenzie recognizes Reyes as the vigilante Ghost Rider, and he and Coulson chase Reyes in Coulson's car. The chase ends when Reyes drives into S.H.I.E.L.D.'s invisible quinjet, and the agents take Reyes into custody. Coulson convinces Reyes to help their investigation into Momentum by speaking to Morrow on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s behalf, and he learns that Momentum's misfortunes came about from studying a mysterious book, the Darkhold.|$|E
500|$|As {{shown in}} [...] "The Impossible Astronaut", the Doctor joins his friends at Lake Silencio and then {{approaches}} the astronaut, now {{known to be}} a younger version of River Song, Amy and Rory's daughter, trained to kill the Doctor by the Silence and Madame Kovarian. River does not want to kill him but is unable to fight the suit's control, and the Doctor says he forgives her and reminds her that the event is inevitable. River, despite his warning against interfering with a fixed point, surprises the Doctor by draining the astronaut suit's weapons systems and averting his death. Time becomes [...] "stuck" [...] as a result and begins to disintegrate; all of Earth's history begins to run simultaneously at a fixed moment of 5:02p.m. on 22 April 2011. In London, Holy Roman Emperor Winston Churchill takes the Doctor, his [...] "soothsayer", out from his locked cell <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the condition of time. The Doctor explains the preceding events, as tally marks begin appearing on his arms, indicating the presence of the Silence. After noticing a Silence nest overhead, they are rescued by Amy and a squad of soldiers under her command. Due to the effects of the crack in her bedroom, Amy is cognizant of the altered timeline, though she is unaware that her trusted captain is her husband Rory. Amy takes the Doctor to [...] "Area 52", a hollowed-out Giza pyramid, where they have captured over a hundred Silence and Madame Kovarian. River is also there; aware of the consequences of her actions, she refuses to allow the Doctor to touch her, an event that would [...] "unfreeze" [...] time and allow it to resume. They all wear [...] "eyedrives", external memory eye patches which enable them to avoid the Silence's effect of erasing themselves from memory.|$|E

2500|$|In {{regards to}} the same passage, Suzanne Fields goes on to note [...] "When asked if the stories were true, Mr. Cockburn delicately demurs. 'I don't think I said they were true,' he told The New Republic. 'I don't know there's enough {{exterior}} evidence {{to determine whether they}} are true or not.'" [...] Another of his critics was Franklin Foer of The New Republic, who first noted Cockburn's response: To be fair, Cockburn doesn't exactly endorse these theories. Rather, by noting that all of these Jewish conspiracy stories are [...] "sloshing around the news," [...] Cockburn seems merely to be pointing out that, hey, anti-Semitic ideas are still out there today — so why the shock that [...] endorsed them 30 years ago? Indeed, when I reached Cockburn <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> these conspiracies, he insisted he was just reporting what was already in circulation.|$|E

The conversation got a little heated and I explained they couldn't do it under the name SABBAT as both he and (bassist) Frazer quit, leaving me and (drummer) Simon (Negus) with a lot of debts and financial problems to clear up. This was the reason we carried on as SABBAT and did a third album. Obviously we wanted the new line up to work out but it didn't … simple as that. What it came down to though was Simon Negus and myself, in theory, own the business and name as they left.

2500|$|In July 2009, Coppola was put {{on trial}} for murder, {{racketeering}} and extorting the Local 1235 of the International Longshoremen's Association for over 30 years. If found guilty of all counts, he could have faced life imprisonment. Defense lawyer Henry Mazurek told jurors that Coppola admitted to making a [...] "rash" [...] decision to flee, but that it didn't prove he's a killer. [...] "He didn't want to stand trial for a murder he didn't commit," [...] Mazurek said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jack Dennehy told the jury not to be fooled by Coppola's claims and that Coppola [...] "ran because he didn't want to face a jury like you. He hid because he didn't want to face a jury like you." [...] Thomas Riccardi testified that Coppola {{said he did not}} agree with the Lardiere murder, but that he followed the orders given to him by Tino Fiumara (who was never charged). Genovese family member turned government witness George Barone was also called to aid the prosecution. Barone was such a difficult witness that the prosecutor apparently decided not <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the Lardiere murder.|$|E
2500|$|Rav Judah {{taught in}} the name of Rav that as Moses was dying, Joshua quoted back to Moses the report of [...] about how Joshua stood by the side of Moses all the time. Rav Judah {{reported}} {{in the name of}} Rav that when Moses was dying, he invited Joshua <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> any doubts that Joshua might have. Joshua replied by asking Moses whether Joshua had ever left Moses for an hour and gone elsewhere. Joshua asked Moses whether Moses had not written in [...] "The Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as one man speaks to another[...] [...] [...] But his servant Joshua the son of Nun departed not out of the Tabernacle." [...] Joshua's words wounded Moses, and immediately the strength of Moses waned, and Joshua forgot 300 laws, and 700 doubts concerning laws arose in Joshua's mind. The Israelites then arose to kill Joshua (unless he could resolve these doubts). God then told Joshua that {{it was not possible to}} tell him the answers (for, as [...] tells, the Torah is not in Heaven). Instead, God then directed Joshua to occupy the Israelites' attention in war, as [...] reports.|$|E

2500|$|The witness, Arthur Calgary, who {{was unaware}} of the events and thus failed to come forward and not {{otherwise}} locateable by the police, believed the family would be grateful once he cleared their son's name. He failed to realize the full implications of the information he provides. However, once he does so, he is determined to protect the innocent by finding the murderer. To be able to do so, he visits the retired local doctor, Dr MacMaster, <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> the now-cleared murderer, Jacko Argyle. MacMaster states that he was surprised when Jacko killed his mother. Not because he thought that murder was outside Jacko's 'moral range', but because he thought Jacko would be too cowardly to kill somebody himself; that, if he wanted to murder somebody, he would egg on an accomplice to do his dirty work. MacMaster says [...] "the kind of murder I'd have expected Jacko to do, if he did one, was the type where a couple of boys go out on a raid; then, when the police come after them, the Jackos say 'Biff him on the head, Bud. Let him have it. Shoot him down.' They're willing for murder, ready to incite to murder, but they've not got the nerve to do murder themselves with their own hands." [...] This description seems to be a reference to the Craig and Bentley case which had occurred in 1952.|$|E
2500|$|Stevens {{also took}} part—illegally—in {{lobbying}} for the statehood bill, {{working closely with}} the Alaska Statehood Committee from his office at Interior. Stevens hired Margaret Atwood, daughter of Anchorage Times publisher Robert Atwood, who was chairman of the Alaska Statehood Committee, to work with him in the Interior Department. [...] "We were violating the law," [...] Stevens told a researcher in an October 1977 oral history interview for the Eisenhower Library. [...] "e were lobbying from the executive branch, and there's been a statute against that for a long time.... We more or less, I would say, masterminded the House and Senate attack from the executive branch." [...] Stevens and the younger Atwood created file cards on members of Congress based on [...] "whether they were Rotarians or Kiwanians or Catholics or Baptists and veterans or loggers, the whole thing," [...] Stevens said in the 1977 interview. [...] "And we'd assigned these Alaskans to go talk to individual members of the Senate and split them down on the basis of people that had something in common with them." [...] The lobbying campaign extended to presidential press conferences. [...] "We set Ike up quite often at press conferences by planting questions about Alaska statehood," [...] Stevens said in the 1977 interview. [...] "We never let a press conference go by without getting someone to try <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> statehood." [...] Newspapers were also targeted, according to Stevens. [...] "We planted editorials in weeklies and dailies and newspapers in the district of people we thought were opposed to us or states where they were opposed to us so that suddenly they were thinking twice about opposing us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Virtually unknown at the time, Robert Jess Roth was {{appointed}} the production's director {{based on his}} various successes directing live shows at the Disney theme parks. Eisner and Katzenberg had opted against hiring a more established director in order to retain creative control over the project, believing that an A-list director would likely feel more inclined to challenge their vision. Roth himself had previously pursued Eisner about investing in a Broadway show – originally suggesting a stage adaptation of Mary Poppins (1964) – only to have his idea declined, citing cost of investment and time concerns. However, Eisner invited Roth <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> <b>about</b> pursuing Broadway again in the future once he had finished directing three additional Disney theme park shows. Ultimately impressed with Roth's adaptation of The Nutcracker, Eisner finally suggested an adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, inspired {{by the success of}} a condensed stage version of the film at Disneyland, although briefly discouraged by the idea of having humans instantly transformed into inanimate objects live. Since the film had not yet been released on home video, Roth spent an entire day re-watching Beauty and the Beast in theaters while brainstorming how to present its fantastical elements onstage, and eventually worked with choreographer Matt West and set designer Stan Meyer on their own proposal, with contributions from Menken and Woolverton. In a hotel in Aspen, Roth convinced Eisner and Katzenberg to green-light a Broadway adaptation of Beauty and the Beast using a combination of 140 storyboards, costume sketches, fabric swatches and demonstrating one illusion. Eisner retained final approval over all creative elements of the production, [...] "from the lowest chorus swing performer to the director, stars and design team." [...] Menken was initially skeptical of Roth's qualifications, as he had never directed a Broadway show before. Meanwhile, the producers were concerned that audiences might not be interested in seeing the same story that they had enjoyed on film on Broadway. Among the skeptics was theatrical producer Steven Suskin, author of Opening Night and Broadway, who argued that the production was more likely to be successful in reverse: [...] "(The movie is) basically written as a theater piece. I'm sure it would've worked in the theater first, and it then would've worked in the movies," [...] believing audiences would have difficulties accepting a new version of such an immensely popular work.|$|E
