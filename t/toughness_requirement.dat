40|$|Prior {{austenite}} grain size {{dependence of the}} low temperature impact toughness has been addressed in the bainitic weld metals by in situ observations. Usually, decreasing the grain size is the only approach by which both the strength and the toughness of a steel are increased. However, low carbon bainitic steel with small grain size shows a weakening of the low temperature impact toughness in this study. By direct tracking of the morphological evolution during phase transformation, {{it is found that}} large {{austenite grain}} size dominates the nucleation of intragranular acicular ferrite, whereas small austenite grain size leads to grain boundary nucleation of bainite.

40|$|Mechanical {{behaviour}} of two {{low alloy}} steels (G 11 and G 12) was studied with respect to different phosphorus contents. Tensile strength and yield strength increased while percentage elongation at fracture decreased on increasing phosphorus content. The SEM and light optical photomicrograph of low phosphorus steel (G 11) revealed ferrite and pearlite microstructure. On increasing phosphorus content from 0. 25 wt. % to 0. 42 wt. %, the morphology of grain changed from equiaxed shape to pan-cake shape and grain size also increased. The Charpy V notch (CVN) impact energy of G 11 and G 12 steel at room temperature was 32 J and 4 J respectively and their fractographs revealed brittle rupture with cleavage facets for both the steels. However, the fractograph of G 11 steel after tensile test exhibited ductile mode of fracture with conical equiaxed dimple while that of G 12 steel containing 0. 42 wt. % P exhibited transgranular cleavage fracture. Based on this study, G 11 steel containing 0. 25 wt. % P could be explored as a candidate material for weathering application purpose where the 20 °C <b>toughness</b> <b>requirement</b> is 27 J as per CSN EN 10025 - 2 : 2004 specification...|$|E

PD 7777 {{published}} by British Standard Institute in 2000 proposes an additional fracture requirement {{to the main}} steel components of the low temperatures storage tank where a partial height hydrostatic test is allowed instead of the full height hydrostatic test required in BS 7777. In the PD 7777 a high level (75 J) of fracture toughness {{is required for the}} austenitic weld metal in 9 %Ni steel plate to prevent the re-initiation of ductile fracture from the arrested brittle crack in the weld.

40|$|Crack {{arrest of}} fast running cracks is an {{important}} issue for the safety of steel structures. Crack arrest design can prevent fatal damage of large structures by restricting the influence of the incidents. Therefore crack arrest design is important especially for very large structure, where accidents may cause huge economical and social losses. Propagating shear fracture, long running ductile crack propagation in pipelines and brittle crack propagation in heavy thick shipbuilding steels have been investigated. For the propagating shear fracture issue, a new HLP simulation model, applicable to various backfill conditions, including underwater backfill, was developed. The proposed backfill model {{can be applied to the}} prediction of the crack arrest of propagating shear fracture under various backfill conditions. The new HLP simulation was successful in estimating full-scale burst tests with various backfill depths. The new HLP simulation for underwater pipelines indicated that propagating shear cracks are easily arrested in offshore pipelines compared to onshore pipeline. The <b>toughness</b> <b>requirement</b> of the line pipe for preventing propagating shear fracture can be significantly smaller in underwater pipelines compared to onshore pipelines. The margin of the underwater pipeline for propagating shear fracture was clarified by the new model developed in this thesis. For brittle crack arrest, an empirical approach for long crack propagation has been conducted. Several large-scale crack arrest tests were carried out in order to investigate the long crack arrestability of heavy-thick shipbuilding steel plates. All plates and their welded joints used in this study satisfied the Charpy <b>toughness</b> <b>requirement</b> for EH-grade shipbuilding steels and welded joints. A brittle crack ran along a welded joint and penetrated through the test plate under a stress exceeding 200 MPa, despite the presence of longitudinal stiffeners across the test weld. A brittle crack in a base plate model test with longitudinal stiffeners propagated through the specimen under the maximum design stress. These results suggest that EH-grade cannot ensure arrestability even in the base plate, in case of heavy thick shipbuilding steel. Two crack arrest tests were conducted in order to demonstrate the possibility of long crack arrest using high arrestability steels. The test results indicated that the crack arrest concept could be achieved by a combination of high arrest toughness materials and a special fabrication method which can derive a brittle crack into the base plate of high arrestability plate. The crack arrest design can be used in practice even for large-scale structures using heavy thick steel plates. The effective K concept, as proposed by Machida, et al. 31), provides the boundary of the “arrest” and “propagate” data in the large-scale tests conducted in this work. The effective K concept was found to be valid even for long crack propagation of such a heavy thick steel plate as investigated in this paper.

40|$|Since the 1970 s, the {{development}} of high-strength pipeline steels has followed the route of progressively reduced hardenability through lower carbon and alloying element contents. Microalloying, controlled rolling (CR), and thermo-mechanical controlled processing (TMCP) have been used extensively to achieve the high-strength and other material property requirements despite the trend towards lower carbon content. The primary {{driving force behind the}} evolution of these alloying and processing strategies stems from the concerns over the weldability, particularly the hydrogen assisted cracking (HAC), at ever-increasing strength levels. In doing so, the adverse effects of this steel making philosophy on the structural integrity and steel manufacturing cost have become more pronounced. The steels made using those processes can exhibit high yield to tensile ratio (low strain hardening), low uniform elongation, HAZ softening, and splitting; all of which tend to have detrimental effects on pipeline integrity. The objective of the work described here was to evaluate alternate steels with enhanced hardenability and identifying those that would have a potential to (1) meet the high strength/high <b>toughness</b> <b>requirement</b> but without the adverse effects of the early trial heats of microalloyed TMCP X 80 and X 100 linepipe steels, and (2) exhibit sufficient resistance to HAC.

Since the method appears to be valid under conditions of crack-tip plasticity, subcritical crack growth and load relaxation, tests have been conducted to ascertain the merit of this method as a failure criterion under cyclic loading conditions. The nonlinear energy toughness for cyclic loading is obtained from an envelope of the cyclic load-displacement record, which naturally imposes some restrictions on the loading program. The cyclic toughness parameter has been evaluated for thin center-cracked sheets of 2024 -T 3 and 7075 -T 6 aluminum alloys.

40|$|Abstract. The {{proper balance}} between yield strength, YS, and ductile to brittle {{transition}} temperature, DBTT, {{has been the}} main concern during development of high strength engineering steels {{and the effect of}} microstructure on impact toughness has attracted a great attention during the last decades. In this paper a review concerning the relationship between strength and toughness in steels will be presented and the effect of different microstructural parameters will be discussed, aiming to improve such properties in designing new high strength steels. Complex microstructures, obtained by quenching and tempering (Q&T) and thermo-mechanical (TM) processing are considered. The steels are low/medium carbon steels (C= 0. 04 %- 0. 40 %) with yield strength in the range YS= 500 - 1000 MPa. Results show that the strength and the impact toughness behaviour are controlled by different microstructural parameters and not, {{as in the case of}} polygonal ferritic steels, by the same structural unit (the grain size) and that a “fine ” microstructure is required in order to achieve high levels of both strength and toughness.

40|$|The fierce {{competition}} between steelworks and different alloy design approaches are the motivation behind {{the development of}} new microalloyed structural steels which must satisfy increasingly severe mechanical strength and <b>toughness</b> <b>requirements.</b> Another equally desirable aspects for these new materials are the supression of heat treatments after hot rolling and better weldability, which makes this alloy evolution even more complex. As weldability improvement requires minimization of the carbon content of the steel, these new steels must present hardening mechanisms which does not require the presence of this element. Up to this moment, the most feasible answers to this challenge are steels hardened by copper precipitation, like HSLA- 80 or ASTM A 710, and the so-called Ultra Low Carbon Bainite (ULCB) steels. The aim of this work was to study the effects of some controlled rolling parameters over the mechanical properties of these relatively new steels. The knowledge of these effects certainly will help in the definition of optimized process conditions for these new steel alloy designs. It was verified here that the total strain applied during hot rolling and the finishing temperature were essential to improve the toughness of both alloys; the effect of the former parameter revealed to be more important. The aged HSLA- 80 steel showed greater values of yield strength, but lower toughness than the as-rolled ULCB alloy.

40|$|The Charpy {{upper shelf}} energy {{is widely used}} to assess the <b>toughness</b> <b>requirements</b> of gas {{pipeline}} steels. It has been suggested that the Charpy energy associated with crack propagation can be split in two parts. One is related to flat fracture at the centre of a typical Charpy fracture surface and the other corresponds to slant fracture at the edges. As the dominant failure mechanism in gas linepipes is fast propagating ductile shear, the latter is the most important portion of the fracture energy which can be reasonably attributed to the real failure mode of the pipe. Proper specimens with different flat and slant fracture characteristics are needed for a comprehensive failure analysis of the Charpy specimen. This paper describes recent results from an experimental and computational set of studies on high-toughness gas pipeline steel of grade API X 100. The test matrix consisted of three sets of specimens with different fracture characteristics. It included standard C(T) specimens and tensile bars, a novel slant C(T) specimen and a modified double cantilever beam (DCB), and Charpy V-notch specimens. Each specimen type was associated with studies of flat, slant and mixed mode fracture, respectively. An attempt to use the Gurson ductile damage model to cross-correlate all the experimental data was qualitatively successful in general and was also quantitatively reliable for fracture dominated by flat tearing. However it was not quite accurate enough to transfer the slant C(T) data to the modified DCB test. Despite that, the insight obtained suggested that an energy transfer model is relevant, and the paper concludes by showing how this can be used to apportion the data from the Charpy test...|$|R

As a secondary objective, the microstructure of the HAZ of a TIG welding is to be evaluated. The C 90 is as steel of high hardenability and its base microstructure consists of tempered martensite with a Vickers hardness of 239 HV 10. The main focus in this work has been to sufficiently soften the weld as well as obtaining impact <b>toughness</b> properties within <b>requirements,</b> by implying a {{post weld heat treatment}} procedure. Hardness values cannot exceed 270 HV 10 and impact toughness energy must exhibit an average value above 40 J. Steel samples have been heated to a peak temperature of 1150 ˚C, followed by controlled cooling at 10 and 60 ˚C/s, prior to post weld heat treatment. Tempering at temperatures of 680 and 720 ˚C has been conducted on the post quenched structure for up to three hours and has been performed in an air circulating furnace and in a Smitweld Thermal Cycle apparatus. Low tempering times (up to 1200 s) have been performed in the Smitweld apparatus. Weld hardness and impact <b>toughness</b> <b>requirements</b> was met after three hours of post weld heat treatment at 720 ˚C in an air circulating furnace, producing a hardness value of 253 HV 10 and a Charpy-V energy of 66 J for the parallel quenched at 10 ˚C/s. After some tempering of the structure, the two cooling rates used did not affect hardness values significantly. Tempering at 680 ˚C did not soften the structure sufficiently to meet the criteria, with the lowest measured hardness of 315 HV 10 after three hours. The hardness of the intercrictial zone of the weld was reduced to 246 HV 10 after tempering for three hours at 720 ˚C. Tempering in the Smitweld apparatus softened the structure more efficiently than what was observed in the furnace, producing hardness values of 271 HV 10 after only twenty minutes of tempering at 720 ˚C. It has been suggested that due to substantially higher heating rates obtained by the Smitweld apparatus, low temperature tempering mechanisms may be inhibited or delayed, resulting in a post tempered structure consisting of coarse carbides with large inter particle spacing, contributing little to precipitation hardening. Heating rates obtained by Smitweld is in the same range as those obtainable by the SAG-FW procedure, and the two methods are therefore considered comparable. FMC Technologies uses a TIG weld procedure followed by a six hour post weld heat treatment to obtain satisfactory mechanical properties on the C 90 steel quality. It is suggested, that by applying a solid state weld procedure, the total tempering time can be reduced with at least 50 %...|$|R

The healing of delamination cracks in laminates containing particles or fibres of the mendable thermoplastic poly[ethylene-co-(methacrylic acid) ] (EMAA) was investigated. The {{results showed that the}} formation of largescale bridging zone of EMAA ligaments along the crack upon healing yielded a large increase (similar to 300 %) in the static mode I interlaminar fracture <b>toughness,</b> exceeding the <b>requirement</b> of full restoration.

Under fatigue loading, healing by the EMAA was found to restore the mode I fatigue crack growth resistance, with the rates of growth being slightly less than that pertinent to the unmodified laminate. The EMAA bridging zone, which generated high toughness under static loading conditions, does not develop under fatigue loading because of rapid fatigue failure of the crack bridging ligaments. Similar to the multiple healing capability of EMAA under static loading, multiple healing of delamination fatigue cracks is confirmed, with the fatigue crack growth rates remaining approximately unchanged.

To address these issues, improvements in the hot mix asphalt (HMA) blends are being implemented. The new generation of asphalt pavements such as coarse graded Superpave mixtures, Stone Matrix Asphalt (SMA) and Porous Friction Course (PFC) rely more on stone-on-stone contact for a stronger coarse aggregate skeleton.

40|$|The {{application}} of modern high strength {{low alloy steels}} (HSLA) in pressure vessel design is currently hindered by the corresponding design standards although it might foster resource-efficient constructions. HSLA steels are penalised by a limited admissible exploitation of their properties which prevents thinner constructions. This limitation is imposed by the design stress definition of the design standards, such as the European code EN 13445. They relate the design stress for high strength steels to the tensile strength, including a high safety factor. This leads to lower design stresses for high strength steels due to their high yield-to-tensile ratio. The admissible design stress is only 46 % of the nominal yield strength for a grade P 690 Q. The current safety factors are based on experiences with common, low strength steels and do not consider the improved toughness properties of modern HSLA steels. Probabilistic safety concepts, as defined in the Eurocode (EN 1990), are a suitable tool to systematically derive more adequate safety factors for modern steels. However, they require a large number of full-scale burst tests. Since these are very costly, probabilistic safety concepts are not directly applicable in pressure vessel design. A possible solution to this problem is to partially replace burst tests by simulations. Ductile failure can hereby be predicted by the methods of damage mechanics. Yet, these models are mainly applied on the small scale or for the failure prediction in components with defects. The aim of this thesis is to develop a comprehensive modelling concept for the prediction of limit states in pressure vessels by damage mechanics simulations and demonstrate its predictive capabilities in comparison to a burst test. Such a modelling concept needs to fulfil three main requirements: It needs to be efficient {{so that it can be}} applied in a high number of large-scale pressure vessel simulations, it needs to cover all relevant stress states, and it needs to refer to nominal toughness values. The latter is necessary because pressure vessel design is always based on nominal material values. The modelling concept was developed by joining existing simulation approaches and providing new solutions for the missing links. The failure process in high quality HSLA steels was investigated by stopped experiments to define a suitable limit state. The local onset of softening, homogenised over the typical size of a finite element, was defined to be a suitable limit state. A numerical procedure using cell elements was applied to derive the corresponding limit strains in dependence of the stress state from simulations using Gurson models. This enabled the reference to nominal toughness levels which can be adjusted by an artificial deterioration of the Gurson parameters. This concept was extended to consider Lode angle dependence and adiabatic heating. Additionally, a calibration scheme was defined on the basis of a sensitivity analysis to enable a reliable correlation of Gurson parameters and toughness level. Since the {{application of}} strain-based limit criteria may lead to mesh influences in large-scaled simulations with varying mesh sizes, a scaling function for the limit strain criterion was developed and tested. For comparison, a demonstrator pressure vessel made from the high strength steel grade P 690 Q was tested in a burst test. The vessel had a length of approximately 3 m, an outer diameter of 1200 mm, a nozzle with an outer diameter of 470 mm and a wall thickness of 50 mm. The simulation models were calibrated on small scale tests performed on samples produced from the identical material. During the burst test the vessel was filled with water through valves in the nozzle top. The burst pressure was 680 bar. The failure initiated at the transition from nozzle to vessel by ductile damage. The pressure vessel withstood three times its design pressure of 226 bar. The modelling concept was tested within simulations of this burst test. The limit state in the simulation was reached first at a pressure of 653 bar; this is 96 % of the burst pressure. The critical locations, at which first cracks appeared in the experiment, were predicted correctly at the transition from nozzle to vessel. The scaling function enabled a mesh-independent limit pressure prediction. The prediction capabilities of the developed concept were therefore successfully demonstrated. An application of this modelling concept with reference to nominal toughness values could show that the predicted nominal limit pressure was well below a global nonlinear behaviour but much higher than the design pressure. The nominal limit state criterion was applied in a large number of pressure vessel simulations within the accompanying research project. These formed the basis for a subsequent application of probabilistic safety concepts. The computed appropriate design stress level was 63 % of the yield strength. Consequently, these results question the current penalisation of high strength steels. The safe applicability of high strength steels in pressure vessel design could therefore be demonstrated by experiments as well as simulations. The potential for a reduction of the safety factors was revealed by the accompanying probabilistic assessment. The developed modelling concept enables an innovative, scale-bridging failure modelling in large-scaled steel structures with references to nominal <b>toughness</b> <b>requirements.</b> It may be used in future studies to investigate the efficient and safe application of high strength steels in other steel constructions and components as well...|$|R
