5|$|What {{all these}} {{different}} varieties of functionalism share in common is <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>that</b> mental states are characterized by their causal relations with other mental states and with sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. That is, functionalism abstracts away from {{the details of the}} physical implementation of a mental state by characterizing it in terms of non-mental functional properties. For example, a kidney is characterized scientifically by its functional role in filtering blood and maintaining certain chemical balances. From this point of view, it does not really matter whether the kidney be made up of organic tissue, plastic nanotubes or silicon chips: it is the role that it plays and its relations to other organs that define it as a kidney.|$|E
5|$|Weber's essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism is {{his most}} famous work. It is argued that this work should {{not be viewed as}} a {{detailed}} study of Protestantism, but rather as an introduction into Weber's later works, especially his studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economic behaviour as part of the rationalisation of the economic system. In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Weber put forward <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>that</b> Calvinist ethic and ideas influenced the development of capitalism. He noted the post-Reformation shift of Europe's economic centre away from Catholic countries such as France, Spain and Italy, and toward Protestant countries such as the Netherlands, England, Scotland and Germany. Weber also noted that societies having more Protestants were those with a more highly developed capitalist economy. Similarly, in societies with different religions, most successful business leaders were Protestant. Weber thus argued that Roman Catholicism impeded the development of the capitalist economy in the West, as did other religions such as Confucianism and Buddhism elsewhere in the world.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, E.V. Ramasamy's chief lieutenant, Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai, {{established}} a separate association called the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), or Dravidian Progressive Federation. This {{was due to}} differences between the two, while Periyar advocated a separate independent Dravidian or Tamil state, Annadurai compromised with the Delhi government, {{at the same time}} claiming increased state independence. E.V. Ramasamy was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake the task of eradicating the social evils in the Indian sub-continent have to pursue the goal with devotion and dedication without deviating from the path and with uncompromising zeal. Thus, if they contest elections aiming to assume political power, they would lose vigour and sense of purpose. But among his followers, there were those who had a different view, wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running the government. They were looking for an opportunity to part with E.V. Ramasamy. Thus, when E.V. Ramasamy married Maniammai on 9 July 1948, they quit the Dravidar Kazhagam, stating that E.V. Ramasamy married maniammayar who was daughter of kanagasabhai when he was 70 and she 32. Those who parted company with E.V. Ramasamy joined the DMK. Though the DMK split from the Dravidar Kazhagam, the organisation made efforts to carry on E.V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement to villagers and urban students. The DMK advocated <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>that</b> the Tamil language was much richer than Sanskrit and Hindi in content, and thus was a key which opened the door to subjects to be learned. The Dravidar Kazhagam continued to counter Brahminism, Indo-Aryan propaganda, and uphold the Dravidians' right of self-determination.|$|E

40|$|This <b>thesis</b> contends <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lodestar of R. S. Thomas’s {{theological}} {{thinking is}} not metaphysics but hermeneutics. Specifically, while discussing {{the whole range}} of Thomas’s poetry, from the work of the Manafon years onwards, and including the ekphrastic sequences, <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> suggests <b>that</b> Thomas’s religious poetry does not present us with ontologically-premised ‘models’ of divinity; rather, <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> argues <b>that</b> Thomas is much more interested in examining and exploring the various reasons why man feels compelled to ‘interpret’ divinity in a particularly ‘metaphysical’ manner. <b>The</b> <b>thesis</b> argues <b>that</b> a central theme in much of Thomas’s religious poetry pivots on an appeal for perceptual and thus conceptual renewal. Thomas, it is argued, is neither religiously ‘orthodox’ nor religiously ‘heterodox’; his religious poems do not project a specific ‘metaphysics’ of divinity—such as the supposition that God is ‘absent’—but posit that one-dimensional theological formulations stem from theological misinterpretations. Thomas, therefore, is read as a religious poet whose primary intellectual goal is to contest and then eradicate theological confusions, and, <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> maintains, <b>the</b> poet often stresses that these confusions stem from theological unawareness. Whereas most Thomas scholarship asserts that the poet is indeed hypothesising an explicitly ‘metaphysical’ understanding of divinity, this <b>thesis</b> states <b>that</b> much of Thomas’s religious poetry has the intention of demolishing ontological paradigms. <b>The</b> <b>thesis</b> argues <b>that</b> Thomas’s religious poetry presents a ‘symbiotic’ understanding of divinity. God must not be understood via a single predicate; for example, we must not attempt to comprehend the Being of God through the metaphysical postulations that He is absent, immanent, or transcendent. Rather, predicative symbioses provide us with the best way of understanding God. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> argues <b>that</b> this symbiotic understanding of God is ripe with intellectual possibilities; that is, our religious imaginations are refreshed as soon as we become aware of predicative complexity in regard to descriptions of God. It is also argued that the crux of Thomas’s religious verse is not ontology but psychology; the poet wants us to examine the foundations of our religious nomenclature and, by extension, he wishes us to investigate the reasons why we feel duty-bound to construe divinity by means of ontology. <b>The</b> <b>thesis</b> therefore argues <b>that</b> Thomas’s religious poetry performs an essentially cathartic, or even ‘therapeutic’, function. Thomas dismantles theological ontology and, by so doing, he shows us that our theological suppositions and conjectures often originate from a misleading point of departure. Thomas’s religious poetry reengineers needlessly ‘metaphysical’ machinery in our theological understanding; his poems challenge largely-accepted religious rubrics and demonstrate the necessity for intellectual reform. In Thomas’s theological lexicon, <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> argues, faith is cognate with doubt and vice versa. <b>The</b> <b>thesis</b> maintains <b>that</b> Thomas’s religious poems do not so much project a specific understanding of divinity, as disclose fallacious theological archetypes. Thus, the broad argument of <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> is <b>that</b> Thomas’s religious poetry is intended to expose, and subsequently undermine, inaccurate theological thinking, with the eventual intention of revitalising man’s religious comprehension...|$|R
40|$|In this postscript, I {{argue that}} a sociological {{approach}} to regulating securities markets requires a clear stance {{on the relationship between}} price and value, one that combines (a) <b>the</b> contrarian <b>thesis</b> <b>that</b> there are objective criteria by which one can assess value more accurately than the current market price; (b) <b>the</b> constructionist <b>thesis</b> <b>that</b> prices are governed by commonly known beliefs that can vary substantially from the objective reality they purport to reflect; and (c) <b>the</b> realist <b>thesis</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> market comprises powerful mechanisms (arbitrage and learning) that, when working properly, close the gap between the contrarian's private belief and common knowledge, thus producing reasonable prices.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>thesis</b> defends Rawls’s idea {{of public}} reason as a purely {{normative}} basis of critical political judgment against its various criticisms by democratic theories of justice from normative deliberative democracy to radical democracy. <b>The</b> <b>thesis</b> focuses on <b>the</b> basic criticism of Rawls’s idea of public reason as a legitimating {{basis of a}} conservative political doctrine that serves to perpetuate injustice and relations of domination. Criticisms of Rawls’s idea of public reason are developed {{on the basis of}} an interpretation of Rawls’s idea of stability in terms of a notion of political stability as concerned with the preservation of existing constitutionally guaranteed rights. Such criticisms argue that such a notion of political stability is the basic motivation of Rawls’s development of a freestanding political conception that can be the basis of an overlapping consensus, and for those critiques, his idea of public reason functions as a regulative principle to secure political actors’ claims of justice to be articulated within the limits of overlapping consensus over the existing political values. <b>The</b> <b>thesis</b> argues against such criticisms of Rawls’s idea of public reason on the basis of reconstructing Rawls’s political conception of justice in terms of Kantian political philosophy. <b>The</b> <b>thesis</b> argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> basic contrast between critics of Rawls’s political conception of justice and Rawls relies on their fundamental disagreement over the question of the subject of political justice. <b>The</b> <b>thesis</b> contends <b>that</b> critics of Rawls have a conception of political justice as collective self-determination of common ends of a political community. In contrast to such conceptions of democratic justice, <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> argues <b>that</b> Kantian political philosophy conceives political justice as securing the conditions of co-existence of freedom of choice of individuals, and therefore, the ideal of equal freedom of external action regardless of the worth or ends of these actions is the regulative idea of political justice. In this context, <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> reformulates Rawls’s idea of stability in terms of Kantian political philosophy. <b>The</b> <b>thesis</b> argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> question of stability that interests Rawls {{is not a question of}} how actual constituents of a political order can maintain their allegiance to the existing social and political institutional structures of a polity. Rather, Rawls’s idea of stability is a question of normative stability, as it emerges within the ideal theory of justice. In this respect, <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> argues <b>that</b> Rawls’s idea of overlapping consensus does not concern the justification of the content of political justice. Rather, the idea of overlapping consensus shows only the possibility of each citizen’s acceptance of the priority of demands of justice as in accord with their reasonable comprehensive doctrines. In this context, <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> normative content of Rawls’s idea of public reason is not given by the existing political values over which there is an actual consensus, however widely shared it may be. Rather, <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> claims <b>that</b> <b>the</b> normative content of idea of public reason is specified on the basis of those principles of justice justifiable in the ideal theory of a fictional well-ordered society. Rawls’s idea of public reason provides a critical standpoint of political judgment for both public officials and private citizens on the basis of which those existing political structures and their organizing principles can be judged and transformed. When conceived in terms of a coercive system of laws as guaranteeing reciprocal freedom of actions within ideal theory, <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> argues <b>that</b> Rawls’s idea of public reason cannot be criticized for being normatively deficient, indeterminate or politically impotent regarding the questions of political justice. <b>The</b> <b>thesis</b> also argues <b>that</b> Rawls’s political conception of justice with its idea of public reason is necessary for identifying actual instances of injustice. On this basis, <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> shows <b>that</b> Rawls’s idea of public reason is the normative ground on the basis of which political actors can judge whether both their own claims and public laws are justifiable by the ideal of equal freedom...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates why EU {{single market}} {{legislation}} sometimes privileges {{national regulatory authorities}} ("NRAs") as the authoritative decision-makers while other legislation in the same field privileges EU regulatory Agencies. Most {{of the literature on}} both EU regulatory Agencies and independent NRAs has explained their creation in functional terms. While there may be functional benefits to be gained from creating regulatory bodies in EU legislation, <b>the</b> <b>thesis</b> argues <b>that</b> their design is not necessarily determined by the standard functional imperatives – indeed, sometimes such delegates, at least from the perspective of actually meeting functions such as credible commitment, may be designed by principals to be ineffective.
