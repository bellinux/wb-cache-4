40|$|Bovine {{mastitis}} is {{a costly}} {{disease in the}} U. S. dairy industry. Its major causative agent Staphylococcus aureus is often unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. Our first study examined <b>terpeneless,</b> cold-pressed Valencia (CPV) orange oil as a possible alternative to antibiotic therapy {{in the treatment of}} S. aureus associated bovine mastitis. Orange oil showed significant inhibition of S. aureus growth and invasion of bovine epithelial mammary cells, but only modest reductions in pre-formed biofilms, which contribute to persistence of S. aureus infections. Our second study examined major components of <b>terpeneless,</b> CPV orange oil. Of four major compounds tested, only citral and linalool had significant inhibitory effects on S. aureus growth. In addition, they were capable of reducing pre-formed biofilms as well as association and invasion to bovine epithelial mammary cells. Part of this inhibition was due to downregulation of virulence and biofilm genes...|$|E
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{properties of}} essential oils, terpineol, and orange oil, in particular, varied {{according to the}} type of bacteria tested. Terpineol and other <b>terpeneless</b> fractions of citrus oils appeared to have greater inhibitory effect on food-borne bacteria than the other citrus oils or derivatives. Gram-positive bacteria were, in general, more sensitive to essential oils than gram-negative bacteria. Terpineol extended the shelf life of commercially pasteurized skim milk, low-fat milk, and whole milk for more than 56 days at 4 C. Orange oil extended the shelf life of skim milk and low-fat milk for the same period...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken to identify an antimicrobial for use during chilling in beef processing, including periods of temperature abuse, {{as well as}} to evaluate membrane filtration as means to remove essential oils from bacteria to prevent further antibacterial action. Cold pressed <b>terpeneless</b> Valencia orange oil was examined in combination with various temperatures (37 °C, 10 °C, and 4 °C) to determine its antimicrobial activity against various strains of bacteria. The strains were tested using a ninety-six well microtiter plate method, with or without membrane filtration. The compound 2, 3, 5 -triphenyl tetrazolium chloride was used as a growth indicator. Serial, two fold dilutions of the oil were tested. Plates were incubated at 37, 10, or 4 °C for times up to 48 hours. Under the non-filtration method, 6 hours of exposure to the oil at 37 °C, resulted in strains of E. coli O 157 :H 7 being inhibited at oil concentrations ranging from 0. 6 % to 0. 2 %, with a mean of 0. 4 ± 0. 01 %. At 10 °C, the O 157 :H 7 strains were shown to be inhibited at concentrations ranging from 1. 4 to 0. 9 %, with a mean of 1. 1 ± 0. 2 %, after 6 hours. At 4 °C, O 157 :H 7 strains were inhibited after 6 hours at concentrations ranging from 4. 6 to 2. 3 %, with a mean of 3. 5 ± 2. 1 %. Under the membrane filtration method, E. coli O 157 :H 7 was inhibited by cold pressed <b>terpeneless</b> Valencia orange oil at a concentration of 0. 5 ± 0. 0 %, L. monocytogenes at 0. 5 ± 0. 0 %, S. aureus at 0. 31 ± 0. 13 %, S. Typhimurium at 0. 31 ± 0. 13 %, S. sonnei at 0. 75 ± 0. 29 %, Y. enterocolitica at 0. 31 ± 0. 13 %, E. faecalis at 0. 63 ± 0. 25 %, B. cereus at 0. 44 ± 0. 13 %, and P. aeruginosa exhibited complete resistance to the oil. The ranges of MICs found under the non-filtration method appear {{to be the result of}} effects from the variable nature of a complex media and an antimicrobial that presents potential multiple mechanisms for inhibition of E. coli O 157 :H 7 at refrigeration temperatures. The MICs found under the membrane filtration method were not significantly greater than those found by prior studies, indicating that membrane filtration is not required for determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations for essential oils...|$|E
40|$|The causative {{agent of}} White-nose Syndrome (WNS), Pseudogymnoascus destructans, {{has been shown}} to be fatal to several species of bats in North America. To date, no {{compounds}} or chemical control measures have been developed which eliminates the growth of the fungus in the environment or in affected animals. In the current study, we evaluated the activity of cold-pressed, <b>terpeneless</b> orange oil (CPT) against multiple isolates of P. destructans in vitro. For all assays, a modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion assay was used. Standardized spore suspensions were prepared, adjusted to a specific optical density, and used to plate fungal lawns. Plates were incubated at either 15 °C or 4 °C for up to 6 months and checked at regular intervals for growth. Once controls had grown, zones of inhibition were measured (mm) on test plates and compared to those obtained using current antifungal drugs. All P. destructans isolates were completely inhibited by 100 % CPT (10 μL) at 1 month of incubation regardless of temperature (4 °C and 15 °C). Complete inhibition persisted up to 6 months following a single exposure at this concentration. Of the standard antifungals, only amphotericin B demonstrated any activity, resulting in zone diameters ranging from 58 mm to 74 mm. CPT, at the highest concentration tested (100 %), had no significant effect against a variety of other environmental organisms including various filamentous fungi, bacteria and aerobic actinomycetes. Given that CPT is relatively non-toxic, the possibility exists that the all-natural, mixture could be used as an environmental pre-treatment to eradicate P. destructans from bat habitats. Additional studies are needed to assess any undesirable effects of CPT on bat behavior and health and overall impacts on other members of the interconnected ecosystem(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Staphylococcus aureus is the {{pathogen}} most often and prevalently involved in skin and soft tissue infections. In recent decades outbreaks of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) have created major problems for skin therapy, and burn and wound care units. Topical antimicrobials {{are most important}} component of wound infection therapy. Alternative therapies are being sought for treatment of MRSA and one area of interest {{is the use of}} essential oils. With the increasing interest in the use and application of natural products, we screened the potential application of <b>terpeneless</b> cold pressed Valencia orange oil (CPV) for topical therapy against MRSA using an in vitro dressing model and skin keratinocyte cell culture model. Methods The inhibitory effect of CPV was determined by disc diffusion vapor assay for MRSA and vancomycin intermediate-resistant S. aureus (VISA) strains. Antistaphylococcal effect of CPV in an in vitro dressing model was tested on S. aureus inoculated tryptic soya agar plate. Bactericidal effect of CPV on MRSA and VISA infected keratinocyte cells was examined by enumeration of extra- and intra-cellular bacterial cells at different treatment time points. Cytotoxic effects on human skin cells was tested by adding CPV to the keratinocyte (HEK 001) cells grown in serum free KSFM media, and observed by phase-contrast microscope. Results CPV vapour effectively inhibited the MRSA and VISA strains in both disc diffusion vapour assay and in vitro dressing model. Compared to untreated control addition of 0. 1 % CPV to MRSA infected keratinocyte decreased the viable MRSA cells by 2 log CFU/mL in 1 h and in VISA strain 3 log CFU/mL reduction was observed in 1 h. After 3 h viable S. aureus cells were not detected in the 0. 2 % CPV treatment. Bactericidal concentration of CPV did not show any cytotoxic effect on the human skin keratinocyte cells in vitro. Conclusions At lower concentration addition of CPV to keratinocytes infected with MRSA and VISA rapidly killed the bacterial cells without causing any toxic effect to the keratinocytes. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} warrant further in vivo study to evaluate the potential of CPV as a topical antistaphylococcal agent. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractResearch {{on the use}} {{of natural}} {{products}} to treat or prevent microbial invasion as alternatives to antibiotic use is growing. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) play a vital role with regard to the innate immune response that affects severity or duration of mastitis. To our knowledge, effect of cold-pressed <b>terpeneless</b> Valencia orange oil (TCO) on bovine PMNL function has not been elucidated. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of TCO on bovine blood PMNL chemotaxis and phagocytosis capabilities and the expression of genes involved in inflammatory response in vitro. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were isolated from jugular blood of 12 Holstein cows in mid-lactation and were incubated with 0. 0 or 0. 01 % TCO for 120 min at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2, and phagocytosis (2 × 106 PMNL) and chemotaxis (6 × 106 PMNL) assays were then performed in vitro. For gene expression, RNA was extracted from incubated PMNL (6 × 106 PMNL), and gene expression was analyzed using quantitative PCR. The supernatant was stored at − 80 °C for analysis of tumor necrosis factor-α. Data were analyzed using a general linear mixed model with cow and treatment (i. e., control or TCO) in the model statement. In vitro supplementation of 0. 01 % of TCO increased the chemotactic ability to IL- 8 by 47 %; however, migration of PMNL to complement 5 a was not altered. Treatment did not affect the production of tumor necrosis factor-α by PMNL. Expression of proinflammatory genes (i. e., SELL, TLR 4, IRAK 1, TRAF 6, and LYZ) coding for proteins was not altered by incubation of PMNL with TCO. However, downregulation of TLR 2 [fold change (FC=treatment/control) =− 2. 14], NFKBIA (FC= 1. 82), IL 1 B (FC=− 2. 16), TNFA (FC=− 9. 43), and SOD 2 (FC=− 1. 57) was observed for PMNL incubated with TCO when compared with controls. Interestingly, expression of IL 10, a well-known antiinflammatory cytokine, was also downregulated (FC=− 3. 78), whereas expression of IL 8 (FC= 1. 93), a gene coding for the cytokine IL- 8 known for its chemotactic function, tended to be upregulated in PMNL incubated with TCO. Incubation of PMNL with TCO enhanced PMNL chemotaxis in vitro. The expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response was primarily downregulated. Results showed that 0. 01 % TCO did not impair the function of PMNL in vitro. Future studies investigating the use of TCO as an alternative therapy for treatment of mastitis, including dose and duration, for cows during lactation are warranted...|$|E
