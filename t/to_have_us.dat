5|$|Entering Folsom in Atlantic County, US 322 {{passes a}} couple lakes and some wooded residences {{before coming to}} an {{interchange}} with Route 54, where the route has a median. Past this interchange, the road continues southeast through heavily forested areas to an intersection with the southern terminus of Route 73 (signed as County Route 561 Spur). After this intersection, US 322 turns south and enters Hamilton Township, where it encounters County Route 559 at a traffic circle that has been modified <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>US</b> 322 run through it. After passing more woods and a clearing for farms, the road widens into a four-lane divided highway and has an interchange with Route 50. A short while after, the route enters a residential and commercial area, passing by Atlantic Cape Community College before heading {{to the south of}} the Hamilton Mall. Here, US 322 intersects U.S. Route 40, which merges onto the Black Horse Pike.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} Marines, {{there was a}} small {{civilian}} caretaker presence on the island consisting of Kuwaiti citizens, as well as a few shop owners, which surprised the Marines a little bit as they were under the impression that the island was deserted. Nevertheless, the Marines felt very safe and secure on the island as Kuwait was an ostensibly U.S.-allied country, the Kuwaiti government told them it was safe, and {{there was a small}} contingent of Kuwaiti police there as well. In addition, the Kuwaiti civilians with whom the Marines interacted with were friendly and were ostensibly glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>U.S.</b> military forces in their country.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{hearing of}} the {{proposed}} extensions, citizens of Wickenburg, Arizona, Wikieup and Aguila protested <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>US</b> 93 run through their towns instead. The protest was considered and the Arizona Highway Department changed its proposal to meet the protester's arguments. The Arizona State Legislature passed a bill instructing the Highway Department to eventually designate and maintain a route for US 93 from Kingman to US 60 via Wikieup once construction work was completed on existing US 93 within the state. The first extension proposal was modified, asking for the US 93 concurrency with US 66 and US 89 to be signed instead as US 93T and for the proposed US 193 to become US 93A. On June 7, 1937, the finalized proposal was submitted to the AASHO, with the US 93T and US 93A suffixes omitted. Interestingly enough, the proposal wasn't accepted.|$|E

500|$|... "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!" [...] was {{the first}} {{full-length}} episode of the series to be produced in stop motion animation. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh, and Christopher Finnegan animated it at Screen Novelties, while Caballero and Walsh served as the directors. Screen Novelties was chosen by the show's executives to execute the animation because they had already worked with them before in other several smaller projects. These include the revamping of the opening title sequence of the show for 2009's SpongeBob's Truth or Square. Walsh explained, [...] "They dug one of our shorts that we'd done a while back, which was called Graveyard Jamboree with Mysterious Mose, and wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>us</b> apply our sensibilities to SpongeBob ... We {{come from the same}} planet as far as our sense of humor and comic sensibilities are concerned. But we also {{wanted to make sure that}} it felt like a SpongeBob episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Kim Manners {{said of the}} episode: [...] "Not a great show, but a good one. It's {{a lighter}} show. There {{is a lot of}} humor in it, but I think it's a hit with fans because there is some {{wonderful}} Mulder and Scully's relationship stuff. The entire third act is {{just the two of them}} talking, which is actually kind of interesting. The scene where Mulder and Scully talk while stranded on a rock included approximately 10 pages of dialogue. Gillian Anderson said of the scene: [...] "I loved that. That was so much fun, and I think it was written really well... It was just neat <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>us</b> separated from everything and stuck on this island where we could wax philosophical and kind of tell the truth to each other in strange ways." [...] Character Dr. Paul Farraday was named after English scientist, Michael Faraday, maybe.|$|E
500|$|Plans for a Naches Tunnel or highway {{date back}} to the early 1930s, {{designated}} as the Naches Pass Link of Primary State Highway 5. The state legislature appropriated $50thousand (equivalent to $ in [...] ) for a study on the feasibility of a new highway. In the early 1960s, Governor Albert Rosellini established a committee to study the feasibility of a toll road. The route was considered feasible by the committee, and they estimated tolls of $1.50per vehicle (equivalent to $ in [...] ) would need to be levied to pay for the highway. Proponents of the new highway were pushing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 10 routed over the pass, away from the routing over Snoqualmie Pass; however this never occurred. Ultimately, the highway was not built as the state considered the highway unfeasible. The highway has been codified in Washington law since 1970, while the tunnel through Naches Pass has been codified in state law since 1959.|$|E

500|$|Connor Trinneer (who played Commander Trip Tucker), {{felt that}} the finale {{should have had a}} memorable {{farewell}} that he described as a [...] "M*A*S*H moment", but that the producers did not want to focus on such an element. Anthony Montgomery (who played Ensign Travis Mayweather) was similarly displeased with the finale and said [...] "I feel there could have been a more effective way to wrap things up for our show as well as the franchise as a whole. It just seemed to take a little bit away from what the Enterprise cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years." [...] While Frakes enjoyed working with Sirtis again, he said that [...] "the reality is {{it was a bit of}} a stretch <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>us</b> shut down [...] show," [...] and that in hindsight it was a disservice to them. The early criticism forced the show's producers to hold a conference and address the issue. Braga admitted there was cast unrest, but defended the episode as a way to close not just Enterprise but Star Trek as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from her}} work as a vocalist and record artist, Carey was {{becoming}} known as a songwriter, having penned and produced all of her own material throughout her career. During the production of Music Box, she was approached by Epic Records to write and record a song alongside Afanasieff, and release it on the soundtrack to the 1992 film Hero, featuring Dustin Hoffman and Geena Davis. While Carey was interested in the project, Mottola was very adamant over allowing Carey to take part in anything involving film, fearing it would hurt her career. Additionally, Columbia felt uneasy about allowing their highest-selling recording artist to contribute to another label, even a branch of the same parent company, Sony. So they wanted to try the next best thing, which was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>us</b> write something." [...] Still interested in working for the film, Carey agreed to pen the feature song for the film, intended for fellow female singer, Gloria Estefan. Carey and Afanasieff sat together in a studio in New York, and over the course of two hours, composed the song's melody, lyric and concept. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Afanasieff discussed the process in which they had completed the rough version of the song: ...|$|E

He said Fresh & Easy {{had no plans to}} put the Wild Oats name on any additional stores. Fresh & Easy decided to test the new Wild Oats concept in Scottsdale, the spokesman said, “because the original Wild Oats chain had a long history stores there and we felt consumers there would be excited <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>us</b> use it as a test market.” The test is open-ended, he added, with no specific timeframe.

Kinga Göncz, the country's then foreign minister, even {{went as far as}} to describe it as [...] "a landmark in our relations , since the visa waiver was essentially the single unresolved issue." [...] However, Hungarian President László Sólyom, who had promised upon his election in 2005 never to visit the United States as long as fingerprint requirements were part of U.S. visa procedures, refused to sign the agreement on the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, fearing it would give the United States too much access to Hungary's criminal registry.

2500|$|Wheelock {{was among}} the 50 founders in 1911 of the Society of American Indians (1911-1923), the first {{national}} American Indian rights organization developed and run by American Indians. The Society pioneered 20th-century Pan-Indianism, the philosophy and movement promoting unity among American Indians regardless of tribal affiliation. The Society was a forum {{for a new generation}} of American Indian leaders known as Red Progressives: they were mostly prominent professionals from the fields of medicine, nursing, law, government, education, anthropology, ethnology and ministry. They shared an enthusiasm and faith in the inevitability of progress through education and governmental action. The Society met at academic institutions, maintained a Washington headquarters, conducted annual conferences, and published a quarterly journal of literature by American Indian authors. The Society promoted an [...] "American Indian Day", and led the fight for Indians to have United States citizenship.

2500|$|In 1895, Grand Duke Paul {{began an}} affair with a married woman, Olga Valerianova Pistolkors. He was able to obtain a divorce for her and he {{eventually}} married Olga in 1902, while the couple was staying abroad. As they had married defying Nicholas II’s opposition, the Tsar forbade them to return to Russia. Left fatherless, twelve-year-old Maria and eleven-year-old Dmitri moved to Moscow placed under the custody of their uncle Grand Duke Sergei and his wife, Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna, a sister of the Tsarina Alexandra. Maria and Dimitri resented their aunt and uncle, blaming them for the forced separation from their real father, who had abandoned them. Grand Duke Sergei was strict and demanding, but devoted and affectionate towards the children. Marie wrote in her memoirs: [...] "In his fashion he loved us deeply. He liked <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>us</b> near him, and gave us a good deal of his time. But he was always jealous of us. If he had known the full extent of our devotion to our father it would have maddened him." [...] Maria Pavlvona also commented that she could not entirely disagree with those who thought Grand Duke Sergei heartless, self-centered and cruel. Maria had a somewhat strained relationship with her aunt. Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna found difficult to relate to the children and was cold and distant towards them. The teenage Maria was described by her maternal aunt, Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna of Russia, as [...] "full of life and very jolly, but inclined to be self-willed and selfish, and rather difficult to deal with." ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{noting that}} Lungu's Băieți de gașcă stories {{inherently}} fail to explore [...] "a more profound vision", Crețu argues: [...] "Dan Lungu [...] manages to render this shortcoming relative through irresistible comedy: {{not one of}} word play , but one of situation." [...] The volume's eponymous story thus alternates between the apparent seriousness of gang culture and the obstacles they face as individuals, with episodes such as one gang member's frustrations over his girlfriend's nymphomania. Other sections of the volume strike a different note, and include a fictionalized account {{the life of a}} young Englishwoman who decides to settle in Romania. Focusing on Lungu's ability to surprise his readers, Teodorescu commented: [...] "Once in a while, if one does not want to let himself be conquered by his tricks, one may have reactions of mistrust [...] Dan Lungu anticipates this reaction as well and builds up complicity for what he does, like a prestidigitator who, {{at the same time as}} jokingly letting you in on how he has made you believe that he was able to cut himself in two, leads you into the fog of the next trick [...] Whoever carefully reads Dan Lungu gets a free lesson in the manipulation techniques to which all those who wish <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>us</b> convinced of the truth in non-literary fiction will expose us without warning and at times successfully." [...] Cristea-Enache, who praised Băieți de gașcă for displaying [...] "natural breathing", [...] "stylistic mobility" [...] and [...] "dexterity", also argued: [...] "When the young prose author will manage to inject more substance into both his stories and novels, we shall have in him a leading exponent of this new-old literature." ...|$|E
