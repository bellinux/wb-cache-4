5|$|Although no general {{arbitration}} {{treaty was}} entered into, Taft's administration settled several disputes with Great Britain by peaceful means, often involving arbitration.

5|$|Karluk left Esquimalt on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska. The {{immediate}} destination was Nome, {{on the coast}} of <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b> There was trouble from the beginning with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention. On 2 July Karluk reached <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined Alaska and Mary Sachs. While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed for a meeting with the leader to clarify plans, particularly with regard to the Northern Party whose schedule was vague. The meeting was unsatisfactory. Stefansson's attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition. They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said that he expected Karluk to be crushed, and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work. Stefansson would not explain these matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party. Despite the scientists' alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.|$|E
40|$|The {{reusable}} {{design of}} the Space Shuttle requires a target life of 7. 5 hours for the turbopumps of the Space Shuttle main engine (SSME). This large increase from the few hundred seconds required in single-use rockets has caused various problems with the bearings of <b>the</b> turbopumps. <b>The</b> <b>berings</b> of <b>the</b> high pressure oxygen turbopump (HPOTP) were of particular concern because of wear, spalling, and cage failures at service time well below the required 7. 5 hours. Lubrication and wear data were developed for the bearings. Since the HPOTP bearings operate in liquid oxygen, conventional liquid lubricants cannot be applied. Therefore, solid lubricant coatings and lubricant transfer from the polytetrafluorethylene (FTFE) cage were the primary lubrication approaches for the bearings. Measurements were made using liquid nitrogen in a rolling disk machine to determine whether usable elastohydrodynamic films could be generated {{to assist in the}} bearing lubrication...|$|R
5000|$|In 1714, Peter the Great sent a {{party of}} shipbuilders to Okhotsk to allow faster access to the furs of Kamchatka. In 1715, they built the Vostok and in 1716-17 Kozma Sokolov sailed it to Kamchatka. For the next 145 years Okhotsk was the main Russian seaport on the Pacific, {{supplying}} Kamchatka and other coastal settlements. In 1731 the Siberian Military Flotilla was established here. In 1736, Okhotsk was moved two miles downstream to a spit of land {{at the mouth of}} the Okhota, converting the ostrog into a proper port. Vitus Bering's two Pacific expeditions (1725-1729 and 1733-1742) brought in large numbers of people and the first scholars and expert sailors and led to a great deal of building. In 1742 there were 57 buildings, 45 other buildings in <b>the</b> <b>Bering's</b> [...] "expedition settlement" [...] and eight ships in the harbor. Anton de Vieira, of Portuguese origin (son of a Jewish father and Christian mother), was the town's governor at that time. From 1737 to 1837 there was a salt works several miles west on the coast that produced 14-36 tons annually. In 1827 it was worked by 150 exiles and about 100 guards and overseers.|$|R
50|$|Bering soon {{proposed}} a second Kamchatka expedition, much more ambitious {{than the first}} and with an explicit aim of sailing east in search of North America. The political situation in the Russian Empire was difficult, however, and this meant delays. In <b>the</b> interim, <b>the</b> <b>Berings</b> enjoyed their new-found status and wealth: {{there was a new}} house and a new social circle for <b>the</b> newly ennobled <b>Berings.</b> Bering also made a bequest to the poor of Horsens, had two children with Anna and even attempted to establish his familial coat of arms. The proposal, when it was accepted, would a significant affair, which involved 600 people from the outset and several hundred added along the way. Though Bering seems to have been primarily interested in landing in North America, he recognised the importance of secondary objectives: the list of which expanded rapidly under the guidance of planners Nikolai Fedorovich Golovin (head of the Admiralty); Ivan Kirilov, a highly ranked politician with an interest in geography, and Andrey Osterman, a close adviser of the new Empress, Anna Ivanovna. As Bering waited for Anna to solidify her grip on the throne, he and Kirilov worked to find a new, more dependable administrator to run Okhotsk and to begin work on improving the roads between Yakutsk and the coastal settlement. Their choice for the post of administrator, made remotely, was Grigory Skornyakov-Pisarev; possibly the least bad candidate, he would nevertheless {{turn out to be a}} poor choice. In any case, Skornyakov-Pisarev was ordered in 1731 to proceed to Okhotsk, with directions to expand it into a proper port. He did not leave for Okhotsk for another four years, by which time Bering's own expedition (in time for which Okhotsk was supposed to have been prepared) was not far off.|$|R

5|$|The rest of {{the year}} (late summer and fall), {{walruses}} tend to form massive aggregations {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops.

5|$|Arriving at Port Townsend, Washington, on 30 April, Yorktown put to sea on 13 May, {{arriving}} at Iliuliuk, Unalaska, one week later.

Assisted by a revenue cutter, Yorktown guarded the passes to <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b> The crews of the patrolling American ships lacked fresh provisions but carried on {{in spite of}} the hardships imposed by both diet and climate.

5|$|Later on August6, the {{weakening}} trend briefly halted as outflow significantly improved {{due to an}} {{area of low pressure}} north of Meranti. However, wind shear drastically increased, displacing convection to the northwest of the circulation center. By this time, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition. Due to the influence of a major shortwave trough approaching from the west, Meranti took a sharp northward turn. The JTWC issued their final advisory on {{the weakening}} cyclone around 0600UTC on August8. The JMA continued to monitor Meranti as a tropical cyclone until August9. Shortly after becoming extratropical, the remnants of the storm executed a slow, counter-clockwise loop until August12.

5|$|Summer {{distribution}} of fin whales in the North Pacific is the immediate offshore waters from central Baja California to Japan {{and as far}} north as the Chukchi Sea bordering the Arctic Ocean. They occur in high densities in the northern Gulf of Alaska and southeastern Bering Sea between May and October, with some movement through the Aleutian passes into and out of <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b> Several whales tagged between November and January off southern California were killed in the summer off central California, Oregon, British Columbia, and in the Gulf of Alaska. Fin whales have been observed feeding 250 miles south of Hawaii in mid-May, and several winter sightings have been made there. Some researchers have suggested that the whales migrate into Hawaiian waters primarily in the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|The Shenandoah {{destroyed}} {{one more}} prize in the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, then continued to the Aleutians and into <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> and Arctic Ocean, crossing the Arctic Circle on June 19.

She opened continuous fire, destroying a major portion of the Union whaling fleet. Capt. Waddell took aim at a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a wrist strap and fired the last two shots of the American Civil War. Shenandoah had so far captured and burned eleven ships of the American whaling fleet while in Arctic waters.|$|E
50|$|Overtime, the {{remaining}} populations were assimilated. Due to increasingly large suicide rates, the crown made a law prohibiting natives from taking their own lives.

50|$|After leaving Ust-Kut {{when the}} river ice melted {{in the spring}} of 1726, the party rapidly {{traveled}} down the River Lena, reaching Yakutsk {{in the first half of}} June. Despite the need for hurry and men being sent in advance, the governor was slow to grant them the resources they needed, prompting threats from Bering. On 7 July, Spangberg left with a detachment of 209 men and much of the cargo; on 27 July apprentice shipbuilder Fyodor Kozlov led a small party to reach Okhotsk ahead of Spangberg, both to prepare food supplies and to start work repairing the Vostok and building a new ship (the Fortuna) needed to carry the party across the bay from Okhotsk to the Kamchatka peninsula. Bering himself left on 16 August, while it was decided that Chirikov would follow the next spring with fresh supplies of flour. The journeys were as difficult as Bering had worried they would be. Men and horses died, and some men (46 from Bering's party alone) deserted with their horses and portions of the supplies as they struggled to build roads across difficult marshland and river terrain. While Bering's party (which reached Okhotsk in October) fared badly, Spangberg's did far worse. His heavily loaded boats could be tugged at no more than one mile a day - and they had some 685 miles to cover. When the rivers froze, the cargo was transferred to sleds and the expedition continued, enduring blizzards and waist-high snow. Even provisions left by Bering at Yudoma Cross could not fend off starvation. On 6 January 1727, Spangberg and two other men, who had together formed an advance party carrying the most vital items for the expedition, reached Okhotsk; ten days later sixty others joined them, although many were ill. Parties sent by Bering back along the trail from Okhotsk rescued seven men and much of the cargo that had been left behind. Okhotsk's inhabitants described the winter as the worst they could recall; Bering seized flour from the local villagers to ensure that his party too could take advantage of their stocks and consequently the whole village soon faced the threat of starvation. An advance party of Chirikov's division arrived in June 1727 with 27 tons of flour, resupplying <b>the</b> <b>Bering's</b> group, which by then had diminished in numbers.|$|R
50|$|In 1741, the Russian {{government}} sent Vitus Bering, a Dane in {{the service}} of Russia, and Aleksei Chirikov, a Russian, in the ships Saint Peter and Saint Paul on a voyage of discovery in the Northern Pacific. After the ships were separated by a storm, Chirikov discovered several eastern islands of the Aleutian group, and Bering discovered several of the western islands, finally being wrecked and losing his life on the island of the Komandorskis (Commander Islands) that now bears his name (Bering Island). <b>The</b> survivors of <b>Bering's</b> party reached <b>the</b> Kamchatka Peninsula in a boat constructed from the wreckage of their ship, and reported that the islands were rich in fur-bearing animals.|$|R
5|$|The {{effects of}} global climate change are another element of concern. The extent and {{thickness}} of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. Thinner pack ice over <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates. Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea between eastern Russia and western Alaska. However, there are insufficient climate data to make reliable predictions on population trends.|$|E
5|$|Vitus Bering {{had been}} a {{prominent}} sailor in Russia. After successful expeditions in 1725, 1728, and 1730, Bering was sent to explore what is now <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> area of the Pacific in 1740. He soon settled on Kamchatka, where he started a settlement and built two additional vessels, dubbed St. Peter and St. Paul. In 1741 Bering and his company started towards North America, but were stalled by a storm and in being delayed were forced to take land. During the storm they {{could not make out}} the Alaskan coast. The storm proved too powerful so the ships turned around, along the way charting several of the Aleutians, including Gareloi. Since then, it has been barely studied, resulting in a fragmentary knowledge of its eruptions and possibly even unrecorded episodes.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} major {{operations}} in which the ships were involved was Operation Eagle Claw launched by USS Nimitz in 1980 after she had deployed to the Indian Ocean {{in response to the}} taking of hostages in the U.S. embassy in Tehran.

Nimitz conducted a Freedom of Navigation exercise alongside the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal in August 1981 in the Gulf of Sidra, near Libya. During this exercise, two of the ship's F-14 Tomcats shot down two Libyan aircraft in {{what became known as the}} Gulf of Sidra incident.

5|$|The {{majority}} {{of the population of the}} Pacific walrus spends its summers north of the Bering Strait in the Chukchi Sea of the Arctic Ocean along the northern coast of eastern Siberia, around Wrangel Island, in the Beaufort Sea along the north shore of Alaska south to Unimak Island, and in the waters between those locations. Smaller numbers of males summer in the Gulf of Anadyr on the southern coast of the Siberian Chukchi Peninsula, and in Bristol Bay off the southern coast of Alaska, west of the Alaska Peninsula. In the spring and fall, walruses congregate throughout the Bering Strait, reaching from the western coast of Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr. They winter over in <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> along the eastern coast of Siberia south to the northern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and along the southern coast of Alaska. A 28,000-year-old fossil walrus was dredged up from the bottom of San Francisco Bay, indicating Pacific walruses ranged that far south during the last ice age. There were roughly 200,000 Pacific walruses according to the most recent (1990) census-based estimate.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{history of the}} Aleutian Islands began almost immediately following the purchase of Alaska by the United States. Prior to the early 20th century, the Aleutian Islands were essentially ignored by the military of the United States, although the islands played a small role in <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> Arbitration when a number of British and American vessels were stationed at Unalaska to enforce the arbitrators' decision. By the early 20th century, a number of war strategies examined the possibility of conflict breaking out between the Empire of Japan and the United States. While the Aleutian Islands were seen as a potential staging point for invasions by either side, this possibility was dismissed owing to the islands' dismal climate. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed, after which the United States Navy began to {{take an interest in}} the islands. However, nothing of significance was to materialize until World War Two.|$|E
5|$|In 1853, {{prior to}} the {{purchase}} of Alaska by the United States, the United States Navy sent the USS Fenimore Cooper to the Aleutian Islands {{with the aim of}} locating potential harbors and find coal deposits. No coal deposits were found. In 1867, the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire. By 1869, a number of military posts had been established by the Government of the United States, although the Aleutian Islands did not receive such a post, with the nearest post being located on Kodiak Island. The United States Army made the decision to leave the exploration of the Aleutians to the United States Navy, and the latter showed little interest in doing so. The Aleutian Islands played a small role in the ongoing sealing dispute between the United Kingdom and the United States, which later culminated in <b>the</b> <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> Arbitration. In 1888, following what the United States Government saw as an infringement on the nation's sovereignty by Canadian and Japanese sealers, the United States Navy sent a number of its ships to Unalaska to police the foreign sealers.

500|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, Russians began to hunt sea otters in the Kuril Islands {{and sold them}} to the Chinese at Kyakhta. Russia was also {{exploring}} the far northern Pacific at this time, and sent Vitus Bering to map the Arctic coast and find routes from Siberia to North America. In 1741, on his second North Pacific voyage, Bering was shipwrecked off Bering Island in the Commander Islands, where he {{and many of his}} crew died. The surviving crew members, which included naturalist Georg Steller, discovered sea otters on the beaches of the island and spent the winter hunting sea otters and gambling with otter pelts. They returned to Siberia, having killed nearly 1,000 sea otters, and were able to command high prices for the pelts. Thus began what is sometimes called the [...] "Great Hunt", which would continue for another hundred years. The Russians found the sea otter far more valuable than the sable skins that had driven and paid for most of their expansion across Siberia. If the sea otter pelts brought back by Bering's survivors had been sold at Kyakhta prices they would have paid for one tenth <b>the</b> cost of <b>Bering's</b> expedition.

60|$|There are two shabby old inns at Arles, which compete closely {{for your}} custom. I mean by this {{that if you}} elect {{to go to the}} Hotel du Forum, the Hotel du Nord, which is placed exactly beside it (at a right angle) watches your arrival with ill-concealed dis- approval; and if you take the chances of its neighbor, the Hotel du Forum seems to glare at you invidiously from all its windows and doors. I forget which of these establishments I selected; {{whichever}} it was, I wished very much that, it had been the other. The two stand together on the Place des Hommes, a little public square of Arles, which somehow quite misses its effect. As a city, indeed, Arles quite misses its effect in every way; and if it is a charming place, as I think it is, I can hardly tell the reason why. The straight-nosed Arlesiennes account for it in some degree; and the remainder may be charged to the ruins of the arena and the theatre. Beyond this, I remember with affection the ill-proportioned little Place des Hommes; not at all monumental, and given over to puddles and to shabby cafes. I recall with tenderness the tortuous and featureless streets, which looked like the streets of a village, and were paved with villanous little sharp stones, making all exercise penitential. Consecrated by association is even a tiresome walk that I took the evening I arrived, with the purpose of obtaining a view of the Rhone. I had been to Arles before, years ago, {{and it seemed to me}} that I remembered finding on the banks of the stream some sort of picture. I think that on the evening of which I speak there was a watery moon, which it seemed to me would light up the past as well as the present. But I found no pic- ture, and I scarcely found the Rhone at all. I lost my way, and there was not a creature in the streets to whom I could appeal. Nothing could be more pro- vincial than the situation of Arles at ten o'clock at night. At last I arrived at a kind of embankment, where I could see the great mud-colored stream slip- ping along in the soundless darkness. It had come on to rain, I know not what had happened to the moon, and the whole place was anything but gay. It was not what I had looked for; what I had looked for was in the irrecoverable past. I groped my way back to the inn over the infernal cailloux, feeling like a dis- comfited Dogberry. I remember now that this hotel was the one (whichever that may be) which has the fragment of a Gallo-Roman portico inserted into one of its angles. I had chosen it for the sake of this ex- ceptional ornament. It was damp and dark, and the floors felt gritty to the feet; it was an establishment at which the dreadful gras-double might have appeared at the table d'hote, as it had done at Narbonne. Never- theless, I was glad to get back to it; and nevertheless, too, - and this is the moral of my simple anecdote, - my pointless little walk (I don't speak of the pave- ment) suffuses itself, as I look back upon it, with a romantic tone. And in relation to the inn, I suppose I had better mention that I am well aware of the in- consistency of a person who dislikes the modern cara- vansary, and yet grumbles when he finds a hotel of the superannuated sort. One ought to choose, it would seem, and make the best of either alternative. The two old taverns at Arles are quite unimproved; such as they must have been in the infancy of the modern world, when Stendhal passed that way, and <b>the</b> lum- <b>bering</b> diligence deposited him in the Place des Hommes, such in every detail they are to-day. Vieilles auberges de France, one ought to enjoy their gritty floors and greasy window-panes.
