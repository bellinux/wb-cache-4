5|$|With {{the failure}} of the Spanish match, Charles and Buckingham turned their {{attention}} to France. On 1 May 1625 Charles was married by proxy to the fifteen-year-old French princess Henrietta Maria in front of the doors of the Notre Dame de Paris. Charles had seen Henrietta Maria in Paris while en route to Spain. The couple married in person on 13 June 1625 in Canterbury. Charles delayed the opening of his first Parliament until after the second ceremony, to forestall any opposition. Many members of the Commons were opposed to the king's marriage to a Roman Catholic, fearing that Charles would lift restrictions on Catholic recusants and undermine the official establishment of the reformed Church of England. Although he told Parliament that he would not relax religious restrictions, he promised <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> that in a secret marriage treaty with his brother-in-law Louis XIII of France. Moreover, the treaty loaned to the French seven English naval ships that would be used to suppress the Protestant Huguenots at La Rochelle in September 1625. Charles was crowned on 2 February 1626 at Westminster Abbey, but without his wife at his side because she refused to participate in a Protestant religious ceremony.|$|E
25|$|The British sent {{a mission}} under an Assyrian-born British subject, Hormuzd Rassam, who bore {{a letter from}} the Queen (in {{response}} to Tewodros' now three-year-old letter requesting aid). He did not bring the skilled workers as Tewodros had requested. Deeply insulted by the British failure <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> as they were told, Tewodros had the members of the Rassam mission added to his other European prisoners. This last breach of diplomatic immunity was the catalyst to Britain launching the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia under Robert Napier. He traveled from India, then a British colony, with more than 30,000 personnel (a force of 13,000 troops and 26,000 camp followers), which consisted of not only soldiers but also specialists such as engineers. Tewodros had become increasingly unpopular over the years due to his harsh methods, and many regional figures had rebelled against him. Several readily assisted the British by providing guides and food as the expeditionary force marched towards Magdala, where the Emperor had fortified the mountaintop.|$|E
500|$|The {{stance of}} the FIS eased once again, as the inaugural event in Oberstdorf was given {{approval}} to be staged in 1950. During this week-long event, an estimated crowd of altogether 100,000 witnessed {{the world record}} fall three times, with Dan Netzell claiming the final figure of [...] Tauno Luiro eclipsed it the following year by jumping , a world record which would stay in place for almost ten years until Jože Šlibar jumped [...] in 1961. The past two decades of Planica holding a near-monopoly over the world record now seemed a distant memory, as it would instead be Oberstdorf's turn <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> the same.|$|E

500|$|The {{music on}} Escape, in {{particular}} [...] "Five Minutes of Funk", was {{originally intended to}} be rock-oriented, with Hutchins suggesting that the song {{would be similar to}} the [...] "rawer" [...] work of groups such as The Isley Brothers. Whodini had planned to use a Minimoog synthesizer on the track, although Smith left his at home, assuming that he could find one in the UK. Unable to locate one, the group then heard Run–D.M.C.'s [...] "Rock Box" [...] and decided to follow a more R direction. Smith said that although he was told by Jive Records to make the album sound like Run–D.M.C., he [...] "didn't want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> that. Whodini's a bit more adult, I think, and rap's not just for kids anymore." ...|$|E

[...] When they joined the band, they [...] "cleaned up and tightened our sound." [...] The new lineup's first song was [...] "Bonus Mosh Pt. II." [...] They began writing new material, {{and in a few}} months the group had enough songs for a second album. The band initially dismissed a number of songs, since the material wasn't [...] "taking us anyplace new.

According to Mascherino, the group [...] "didn’t spend as much time playing together in order <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> what we wanted to because some of us were new." ...|$|E

I let 50 years go by and see what's really relevant." [...] Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, the Louvin Brothers, and the Blue Sky Boys. She explained her relationship with traditional music by saying, [...] "I've never tried to be traditional. It's been a springboard for me and I love it and revere it and would not be doing what I do without the music of the Monroe Brothers, the Stanley Brothers and the Carter Family. However, it was clear I {{was never going to be}} able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> that; I'm a songwriter." ...|$|E

There may be plenty that is painful in real life; but for that very reason, we don't want it in books. The English novelist who enters my house (no foreign novelist will be admitted) must understand his art as the healthy-minded English reader understands it in our time. He must know that our purer modern taste, our higher modern morality, limits him <b>to</b> <b>doing</b> <b>exactly</b> two things for us, when he writes us a book.

500|$|Northern Force {{made up the}} {{northern}} prong of a pincer movement designed by Botha to encircle the German forces in South-West Africa. Two smaller South African columns came from the Cape and the Orange Free State (the latter coming over the deserts of Bechuanaland). The principal target was Windhoek, the capital of South-West Africa. The field of operations was arid and barren in the extreme; water was a precious commodity, so the South Africans and Southern Rhodesians brought {{thousands of tons of}} it with them. In the [...] of desert between Walvis Bay and Windhoek, temperatures could rise to above [...] in the daytime, then drop below freezing at night, all while desert winds blew sand and dust into every bodily and mechanical orifice. Germany based much of its defensive strategy in South-West Africa around the assumption that no enemy commander could feasibly attempt to advance across the desert from Walvis Bay to Windhoek, but Botha resolved <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> that.|$|E

Let him represent the Imperial Crown, but let Great Britain send Ambassadors to her Dominions, as she does to other countries, {{because they are in}} fact independent countries voluntarily uniting themselves with Great Britain and not a gang of subject States." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because of how {{central to}} the plot {{randomness}} is, NPC behavior was not scripted. Instead, each NPC is assigned certain goals to accomplish based upon whether they are a replicant or a human. How they go about accomplishing these goals is handled by the AI system, and can change from game to game, {{as most of the}} goals have several possible methods of achievement. The developers likened this aspect of the game to simulation games such as SimCity rather than traditional adventure games such as Myst. Castle explains, [...] "those agents are real, goal-oriented artificial intelligences. We don't know what they're going <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>exactly.</b> We've given them behavior, we haven't given them instructions. There's a big difference between behavior-based AI and scripted instructions." ...|$|E

During that time, in 1965, she became romantically involved with David Dalton, a professional photographer. She studied the way he worked during photo shoots, learning about how he set up shots and managed lighting and composition. When she began to do more of her own shoots, such as with music groups, he said he was [...] "astonished" [...] at how easily she was able to take control of unruly or uncooperative musicians. She was able to get her subjects <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> what she wanted without much fuss. Dalton said that shooting rock groups was [...] "a bloody pain in the neck.

2500|$|Duckpin bowling is a {{variation}} of bowling that uses balls which are significantly smaller than those used in ten-pin bowling, weighing [...] each, which are devoid of finger holes. The pins are correspondingly shorter and lighter than their ten-pin equivalents. Hence, when the pins are knocked down, they resemble a [...] "flock of flying ducks". While the rules remained almost identical {{to those of the}} Ten-pin game, one rule change was made: A bowler is allowed to use three bowls on each turn. Strikes would still be strikes and spares still spares, but when all pins were knocked down on the third ball, it counts as a score of ten. During the summer of 1900, some bowlers at Diamond Alleys in Baltimore, Maryland thought it might be interesting to resize the pins to match the 6-inch ball. Thus, the inventor of duckpin bowling, John Van Sant, used a wood turner <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> that.|$|E

[...] After the game on Thursday, the Clemson guys frankly told the Carolina students that if you bring this poster, which is insulting to us, to the big parade on Friday, you're going to be in trouble.

2500|$|Upon its release, Damita Jo {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reviews from most music critics. The album holds an average score of 53 based on 13 reviews on Metacritic. Jesse Washington of The Associated Press commended Damita Jo as [...] "sinfully appealing" [...] and [...] "infectious," [...] saying [...] "relaxation {{is the last}} thing on her agenda with this sinfully appealing concoction of infectious beats and scandalous lyrics." [...] Washington added, [...] "Such content isn’t unusual in today’s pop culture landscape, where cable TV’s raunch is stealing viewers and awards from broadcast networks and the Cat in the Hat tells dirty jokes on movie screens." [...] Jackson's voice was considered [...] "sweet and frosting-light" [...] among the record's [...] "excellent tunes," [...] specifying [...] "We look for her to entertain us with excellent videos, saturate the radio with catchy tunes, and move our bodies in the club. Damita Jo" [...] has the goods <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> that." [...] USA Today rated the album three out of four stars, saying Jackson [...] "isn't sweating it musically" [...] despite negative publicity. The critique regarded Jackson to [...] "freely pursues her sexual and love fantasies", noting [...] "If she ever seemed tentative in her erotic explorations in the past, she's completely self-assured here. [...] This is a happy, loving Jackson, as prone to romantic walks on the beach as to roadside quickies." [...] Its premise of split personae was considered [...] "a bit complicated", but clarified [...] "that's who Damita Jo is."
