5|$|The tornado {{prediction}} {{proved to}} be successful, even if its precision was mostly due to chance.

5|$|After the First Crusade's {{capture of}} Jerusalem and victory at Ascalon the {{majority}} of the Crusaders considered their pilgrimage complete and returned to Europe. Godfrey was left with only 300 knights and 2,000 infantry to defend the territory won in the Eastern Mediterranean. Only Tancred of the crusader princes remained with the aim of establishing his own lordship. At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> Franks held only Jerusalem and two great Syrian cities; Antioch and Edessa but not the surrounding country. Jerusalem remained economically sterile despite the advantages of being the centre of administration of church and state and benefitting from streams of pilgrims.|$|E
5|$|After this intersection, Old Baltimore Pike {{continues}} past suburban neighborhoods, {{gaining a}} center left-turn lane and intersecting Salem Church Road. Farther east, the highway reaches a junction with DE 273 in a wooded area. At <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> road narrows to two lanes again and {{heads into the}} community of Christiana. Here, the highway intersects DE 7, where it turns north and follows that route through residential areas. The road comes to an interchange with DE 1 {{to the west of}} the Christiana Mall, where DE 7 continues north along with DE 1 and Old Baltimore Pike reaches a dead end.|$|E
5|$|Alexios, who was {{fighting}} with his retinue alongside the Franks, {{did not immediately}} realize that his left wing had collapsed. In the meantime, on his right wing, the Chomatenoi, engaged with Tarchaneiotes's men, were outflanked and attacked in the rear by the Pechenegs, who had somehow evaded Alexios's Turkish flank-guards. The Chomatenoi too broke and fled, and Alexios's fate seemed sealed. At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> Pechenegs failed to follow up their success, and instead turned back and began looting Bryennios's own camp. After gathering what plunder they could, they left the battle and made for their homes.|$|E

5|$|Although Montcalm {{and other}} French {{officers}} attempted to stop further attacks, others did not, and some explicitly refused to provide further protection to the British. At <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> column dissolved, as some {{tried to escape}} the Indian onslaught, while others actively tried to defend themselves. Massachusetts Colonel Joseph Frye reported that he was stripped of much of his clothing and repeatedly threatened. He fled into the woods, and did not reach Fort Edward until 12 August.|$|E
5|$|Amy neared {{hurricane}} intensity several times, {{beginning on}} June30 as maximum winds increased to 70mph (110km/h); however, {{the storm was}} unable to acquire enough tropical features, and remained predominately subtropical. Gale-force winds at this time extended roughly 125mi (210km) out from the center {{to the north and}} east. Despite being subtropical at <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> NHC decided against renaming it due to Amy's proximity to land. On July2, a barometric pressure of 981mbar (hPa; 28.97inHg) was recorded, the lowest in relation to Amy. The following day, another trough caused the storm to accelerate northeastward. On July4, Amy passed roughly 170mi (270km) southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland before becoming an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the French {{government}} {{tried to}} impose a system of crossing Poitevin horses with lighter-weight Norman and Thoroughbred horses to create cavalry horses. Despite financial incentives, private breeders protested because they felt that the resulting crossbred horses created poor quality mules upon further breeding. The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its marshy homeland, including large hooves and a calm manner. Some sources argue that at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state that they were not pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.|$|E

At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> road becomes Chestnut Hill Road and runs between farmland to the north and residential neighborhoods to the south as it comes to a crossing of Norfolk Southern's Delmarva Secondary railroad line.

5|$|At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> plot {{concerned}} {{the crew of}} the Enterprise coming across God in space, something which Roddenberry had previously wanted to include in The Original Series but it had been turned down by NBC Primetime's executives. He thought that such an idea might be palatable to the Daytime executives instead. Roddenberry felt that such an episode would work better in animated form and asked Brody to work up a full script. Brody returned home and started work on the script immediately, wanting to improve it far beyond the point that he had developed when he pitched it for The Original Series.|$|E
5|$|At <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> Greeks of Laconia and Arcadia, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of a certain Michael, tried to stop the Franks at the olive grove of Kountouras in northeastern Messenia. Modern scholars have traditionally identified this Michael with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, founder of the Despotate of Epirus, but this identification has been questioned more recently by Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, as the fragile nature of his control over Epirus would have made a departure to aid the Moreote Greeks a major and unlikely gamble.|$|E

For several days, Northern Epirote units controlled the city, but on March 27 this control was lost to the Albanian gendarmerie upon the arrival of Albanian reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|At <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> {{horses were}} nearly blown, but d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers charged the third line, which they also broke.

The Russian infantry had started to reform their squares behind d'Hautpoul's men. During this charge, d'Hautpoul was struck by artillery grapeshot and badly wounded. Several of his men managed to carry or drag him back to French lines.|$|E
5|$|At <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> {{remainder}} of the series was under threat. Jardine was shaken by the events and by the hostile reactions to his team. Stories appeared in the press, possibly leaked by the disenchanted Nawab of Pataudi, about fights and arguments between the England players. Jardine offered to stop using bodyline if the team did not support him, but after a private meeting (not attended by Jardine or either of the team managers) the players released a statement fully supporting the captain and his tactics. Even so, Jardine would not have played in the fourth Test without {{the withdrawal of the}} unsportsmanlike accusation.|$|E
