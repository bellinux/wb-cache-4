5|$|During this period, Luxembourg {{was allowed}} <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> own {{government}} and political system, but all proceedings were {{overshadowed by the}} German army's presence. Despite the overbearing distraction of the occupation, the Luxembourgish people attempted to lead their lives as normally as possible. The political parties attempted to focus on other matters, such as the economy, education, and constitutional reform.|$|E
5|$|Inuyama castle (犬山城 Inuyama-jō) {{is located}} in the {{southern}} coast of Kiso river in the city of Inuyama, in Aichi Prefecture. In 1537, Oda Nobunaga's uncle, Oda Nobuyasu strengthened the castle. Inuyama castle is claimed to be one of Japan's oldest castles and one of the castles that managed <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> original structure.|$|E
5|$|A Bug's Life grossed {{approximately}} $33,258,052 on {{its opening}} weekend, ranking number 1 for that weekend. It managed <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> number 1 spot for two weeks. The film grossed $162.8million in its United States theatrical run, covering its estimated production costs of $120million. The film made $200,460,294 in foreign countries, pushing its worldwide gross to $363.3million, surpassing the competition from DreamWorks Animation's Antz.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the senate}} could do little short of {{assassination}} and open rebellion to contravene {{the will of}} the emperor, it survived the Augustan restoration and the turbulent Year of Four Emperors <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> symbolic political centrality during the Principate. The senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor needed the experience of senators as legates (legati) to serve as generals, diplomats, and administrators. A successful career required competence as an administrator and remaining in favour with the emperor, or over time perhaps multiple emperors.|$|E
5|$|Early reviews {{praised the}} style of Carnivàle but {{questioned}} the approach and execution of the story. Its first episode set a new audience record for an HBO original series, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> ratings in its second season. It was canceled after 24 episodes, cutting its intended six-season run short by four seasons. It won five Emmys out of fifteen nominations in 2004, and received numerous other nominations and awards between 2004 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|Natural England's role is {{to advise}} and help the owners manage Whitton Bridge Pasture effectively. To achieve this Natural England {{provides}} guidelines for each SSSI. Species-rich grassland, such as that found at Whitton Bridge, requires careful management for it <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> high species diversity. This means many activities are not allowed at the site including: ploughing, drainage {{and the use of}} fertilisers, pesticides or herbicides.|$|E
5000|$|David Knox, {{writer for}} TV Tonight also gave the series 4 out of 5 stars saying [...] "The sequel stands up well, thanks <b>to</b> <b>retaining</b> <b>its</b> links with {{director}} Michael Jenkins and Roxburgh. It does {{adhere to the}} true crime bio-pic path than look more broadly at an era in NSW law & order, with its leading man promoted to anti-hero".|$|R

5|$|The ROCOR, {{forced to}} leave Yugoslavia {{toward the end of}} World War II, {{eventually}} established its base of operations in New York City. In 1946, it was decided at the 7th All-American Sobor that the Metropolia would sever its ties with the ROCOR and attempt to return to the Patriarchate of Moscow. This return was proposed with the stipulation that the Metropolia be allowed <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> autonomy. When this condition was not met, the Metropolia continued as a self-governing Church.|$|E
5|$|The vacant {{property}} was later purchased {{for use by}} a lawyer and then by an auto dealer before being purchased by Joseph Baptista in 2000. Baptista had to survey the ground {{to ensure that the}} gas tanks had been removed.

5|$|After his {{conquest of}} Bulgaria, Basil II {{prevented}} revolts and discontent by retaining {{the rule of}} the local nobility and by relieving the newly conquered lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold, allowing them to be paid in kind instead. He also allowed the Bulgarian Patriarchate <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> autocephalous status and all its dioceses, but reduced it to an archbishopric. After his death Byzantine domestic policies changed and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, the largest being led by Peter Delyan. In 1185 Asen dynasty nobles Ivan Asen I and Peter IV organised a major uprising which resulted in the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with Tarnovo as the capital.|$|E

50|$|The {{many changes}} in {{industrial}} restructuring {{and loss of}} jobs caused the city to adopt new strategies related <b>to</b> <b>retaining</b> <b>its</b> industrial companies. It offered tax incentives to DaimlerChrysler {{for the expansion of}} its Jeep plant. In 2001, a taxpayer lawsuit was filed against Toledo that challenged the constitutionality of that action. In 2006 the city won the case by a unanimous ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno.|$|R

5|$|However, the peels will degrade {{over time}} if they contain any iron sulfide (pyrite or marcasite). Shya Chitaley {{addressed}} {{this problem by}} revising the liquid-peel technique to separate the organic material preserved by the coal ball from the inorganic minerals, including iron sulfide. This allows the peel <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> quality for a longer time. Chitaley's revisions begin after grinding {{the surface of the}} coal ball to a smooth finish. Her process essentially entails heating and then making multiple applications of solutions of paraffin in xylene to the coal ball. Each subsequent application has a greater concentration of paraffin in xylene to allow the wax to completely pervade the coal ball. Nitric acid, and then acetone, are applied to the coal ball. Following that, the process merges back into the liquid peel technique.|$|E
5|$|The British Nationality Act 1981 {{reclassified}} Hong Kong into a British Dependent Territory {{amid the}} reorganisation of global territories of the British Empire. All residents of Hong Kong became British Dependent Territory Citizens (BDTC). Diplomatic negotiations began with China and eventually concluded with the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. Both countries agreed to transfer Hong Kong's sovereignty to China on 1 July 1997, when Hong Kong would remain autonomous {{as a special}} administrative region and be able <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> free-market economy, British common law through the Hong Kong Basic Law, independent representation in international organisations (e.g. WTO and WHO), treaty arrangements and policy-making except foreign diplomacy and military defence.|$|E
5|$|Czechoslovakia {{split into}} the Czech Republic and Slovakia in January 1993. The IIHF {{recognized}} the Czech Republic as {{the successor to}} Czechoslovakia, allowing the team <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> position in the top World Championship division, while Slovakia started in the lowest division (Pool C) in 1994 {{and was forced to}} work its way up. Both nations competed in the tournament at the 1994 Winter Olympics, as did Russia. Slovakia and Finland both finished the preliminary round undefeated. Slovakia lost their medal round quarter-final game to Russia, who later lost to Finland in the bronze medal game. In the gold medal game between Sweden and Canada, both teams finished regulation and overtime play with a 2–2 tie. In the resulting shootout, the first in Olympic competition, both nations scored two goals, which resulted in a sudden death shootout. Peter Forsberg of Sweden scored {{one of the most famous}} goals in Olympic history by faking a forehand shot, then sliding a one-handed backhand shot past goaltender Corey Hirsch. Canada's final shooter Paul Kariya's shot was saved by Tommy Salo and Sweden won the game and its first gold medal.|$|E

5|$|Halban's {{heavy water}} team from France {{continued}} its slow neutron research at Cambridge University; but {{the project was}} given a low priority since it was not considered relevant to bomb making. It suddenly acquired military significance when it was realised that it provided the route to plutonium. The British Government wanted the Cambridge team to be relocated to North America, in proximity to the raw materials it required, and where the American research was being done. But Sir John Anderson wanted the British team <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> own identity, and was concerned that since the Americans were working on nuclear reactor designs using nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator instead of heavy water, that team might not receive {{a fair share of}} resources. The Americans had their own concerns, particularly about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the group was British. They also had concerns about patent rights; that the French team would attempt to patent nuclear technology based on the pre-war work. As a compromise, Thomson suggested relocating the team to Canada.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{the frustrations}} caused by delays to Irish home rule led the MPs of Sinn Féin, a pro-independence party that {{had won a}} {{majority}} of the Irish seats in the 1918 British general election, to establish an independent parliament in Dublin, at which Irish independence was declared. The Irish Republican Army simultaneously began a guerrilla war against the British administration. The Anglo-Irish War ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, creating the Irish Free State, a Dominion within the British Empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown. Northern Ireland, consisting of six of the 32 Irish counties which had been established as a devolved region under the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, immediately exercised its option under the treaty <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> existing status within the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Athens, the Athenian {{democracy}} was restored on three separate occasions following the initial {{conquest of the}} city by Antipater in 322BC. When it fell repeatedly under Macedonian rule it was governed by a Macedonian-imposed oligarchy composed of the wealthiest members of the city-state. Other city-states were handled quite differently and were allowed {{a greater degree of}} autonomy. After PhilipII conquered Amphipolis in 357BC, the city was allowed <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> democracy, including its constitution, popular assembly, city council (boule), and yearly elections for new officials, but a Macedonian garrison was housed within the city walls along with a Macedonian royal commissioner (epistates) to monitor the city's political affairs. Philippi, the city founded by PhilipII, was the only other city in the Macedonian commonwealth that had a democratic government with popular assemblies, since the assembly (ecclesia) of Thessaloniki seems to have had only a passive function in practice. Some cities also maintained their own municipal revenues. The Macedonian king and central government administered the revenues generated by temples and priesthoods.|$|E

5|$|In ancient Athens, the Athenian {{democracy}} was restored on three separate occasions following the initial {{conquest of the}} city by Antipater in 322 BC. However, when it fell repeatedly under Macedonian rule it was governed by a Macedonian-imposed oligarchy composed of the wealthiest members of the city-state, their membership determined by {{the value of their}} property. Yet other city-states were handled quite differently and were allowed a greater degree of autonomy. After Philip II conquered Amphipolis in 357 BC, the city was allowed <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> democracy, including its constitution, popular assembly, city council (boule), and yearly elections for new officials, but a Macedonian garrison was housed within the city walls along with a Macedonian royal commissioner (epistates) to monitor the city's political affairs.

Some cities also maintained their own municipal revenues, although evidence is lacking as to whether this was derived from local taxation or grants from the royal court. The Macedonian king and central government otherwise sustained strict control over the finances administered by other cities, especially in regards to the revenues generated by temples and cultic priesthoods.|$|E
5|$|When it was re-released in 1947, {{it earned}} an {{impressive}} $5 million rental in the United States and Canada, {{and was one}} of the top ten releases of the year. Successful re-releases in 1954 and 1961 enabled it <b>to</b> <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> position as the industry's top earner, despite strong challenges from more recent films such as Ben-Hur, but it was finally overtaken by The Sound of Music in 1966. The 1967 reissue was unusual in that MGM opted to roadshow it, a decision that turned it into the most successful re-release in the history of the industry. It generated a box-office gross of $68 million, making it MGM's most lucrative picture after Doctor Zhivago from the latter half of the decade. MGM earned a rental of $41 million from the release, with the U.S. and Canadian share amounting to over $30 million, placing it second only to The Graduate for that year. Including its $6.7 million rental from the 1961 reissue, it was the fourth highest-earner of the decade in the North American market, with only The Sound of Music, The Graduate and Doctor Zhivago making more for their distributors. A further re-release in 1971 allowed it to briefly recapture the record from The Sound of Music, bringing its total worldwide gross rental to about $116 million by the end of 1971—more than trebling its earnings from its initial release—before losing the record again the following year to The Godfather.|$|E
