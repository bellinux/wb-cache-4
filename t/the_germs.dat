San Francisco's second wave included the Avengers, Negative Trend, the Mutants, and the Sleepers. the Dils, from Carlsbad, moved between the two major cities. The Wipers formed in Portland, Oregon. In Seattle, there was the Lewd. Often sharing gigs with the Seattle punks were bands from across the Canada–US border. A major scene developed in Vancouver, spearheaded by the Furies and Victoria's all-female Dee Dee and the Dishrags. the Skulls spun off into D.O.A. and the Subhumans. The K-Tels (later known as the Young Canadians) and Pointed Sticks were among the area's other leading punk acts.|$|E

40|$|The body axes of Drosophila are {{established}} during oogenesis through reciprocal interactions between <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> line cells and the somatic follicle cells that surround them. The Notch pathway is required at two stages in this process: first, for {{the migration of}} the follicle cells around <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> line cyst and, later, for the polarization of the anterior-posterior (A-P) axis of the oocyte. Its function in these events, however, has remained controversial. Using clonal analysis, we show that Notch signaling controls cell proliferation and differentiation in the whole follicular epithelium. Notch mutant follicle cells remain in a precursor state and fail to switch from the mitotic cell cycle to the endocycle. Furthermore, removal of Delta from <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> line produces an identical phenotype, showing that Delta signals from <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> cells to control the timing of follicle cell differentiation. This explains the axis formation defects in Notch mutants, which arise because undifferentiated posterior follicle cells cannot signal to polarize the oocyte. Delta also signals from <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> line to Notch in the soma earlier in oogenesis to control the differentiation of the polar and stalk follicle cells. <b>The</b> <b>germ</b> line therefore regulates {{the development of the}} follicle cells through two complementary signaling pathways: Gurken signals twice to control spatial patterning, whereas Delta signals twice to exert temporal control...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> {{ability of}} <b>germ</b> cells {{to carry out}} a gene {{regulatory}} program distinct from the surrounding somatic tissue, and their capacity to specify an entire new organism has made them a focus of many studies that seek to understand how specific regulatory mechanisms, particularly post-transcriptional mechanisms, contribute to cell fate. In zebrafish, germ cells are specified through the inheritance of cytoplasmic determinants, termed <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> plasm, which contains a number of maternal mRNAs and proteins. Investigation of several of these messages has revealed that the restricted localisation of these mRNAs to <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> plasm and subsequent germ cells is due to cis-acting sequence elements present in their 3 ′UTRs. Here we show that a member of the Hu family of RNA-binding proteins, HuB, is maternally provided in the zebrafish embryo and exhibits germ cell specific expression during embryogenesis. Restriction of HuB mRNA to <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> cells is dependent on a number of sequence elements in its 3 ′UTR, which act to degrade the mRNA in the soma and stabilise it in <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> cells. In addition, we show that <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> cell specific RNA-binding protein DAZL is able to promote HuB mRNA stability and translation in germ cells, and further demonstrate that these activities require a 30 nucleotide element in the 3 ′UTR. Our study suggests that DAZL specifically binds the HuB 3 ′UTR and protects the message from degradation and/or enhances HuB translation, leading to <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> cell specific expression of HuB protein...|$|R

25|$|Another {{narrative}} indicates that, {{all animals}} (non-humans) {{were created by}} some form of world parent, except the jackal. In this myth, Roog went {{through a period of}} gestation. By thought, Roog planned this new creation, the animal world. By the mythical words, Roog realized the divine placenta and the internal gestation of the animal embryo called Mbocor. Roog then placed in the embryo of this animal, which was the largest of the creation, which included the eggs or seeds of all animals to come, including their organisms and reproductive energies. After the gestation period, Roog projected the embryo of the Mbocor on Earth, which carried all the animals species on Earth. The embryo of Mbocor acclimatized to the earth, feeding on grass and water. It grew rapidly reaching a considerable proportion, as it carried within it <b>the</b> <b>germs</b> of animal life. At the final stages of the gestation of the eggs and embryos that were within it, the animal ripped apart and released all the species within it. The female animals were created first, some spreading on land, in water, the mythical sea, etc. After delivering these animals, the Mbocor died, but animal life which came from the creator deity, spread through the world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Germ cells must {{progress}} through elaborate developmental stages from an undifferentiated germ cell to a fully differentiated gamete. Some of these stages include exiting mitosis and entering meiosis, progressing {{through the various}} stages of meiotic prophase, adopting either a male (sperm) or female (oocyte) fate, and completing meiosis. Additionally, many of the factors needed to drive embryogenesis are synthesized in <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> line. To increase {{our understanding of the}} genes that might be necessary for the formation and function of <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> line, we have constructed a SAGE library from hand dissected C. elegans hermaphrodite gonads. Results We found that 4699 genes, roughly 21 % of all known C. elegans genes, are expressed in <b>the</b> adult hermaphrodite <b>germ</b> line. Ribosomal genes are highly expressed in <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> line; roughly four fold above their expression levels in the soma. We further found that 1063 of the germline-expressed genes have enriched expression in <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> line as compared to the soma. A comparison of these 1063 germline-enriched genes with a similar list of genes prepared using microarrays revealed an overlap of 460 genes, mutually reinforcing the two lists. Additionally, we identified 603 germline-enriched genes, supported by in situ expression data, which were not previously identified. We also found > 4 fold enrichment for RNA binding proteins in <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> line as compared to the soma. Conclusion Using multiple technological platforms provides a more complete picture of global gene expression patterns. Genes involved in RNA metabolism are expressed at a significantly higher level in <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> line than <b>the</b> soma, suggesting a stronger reliance on RNA metabolism for control of the expression of genes in <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> line. Additionally, <b>the</b> number and expression level of germ line expressed genes on the X chromosome is lower than expected based on a random distribution. </p...|$|R
40|$|Steel factor, {{the protein}} {{product of the}} Steel locus in the mouse, is a {{multifunctional}} signal for <b>the</b> primordial <b>germ</b> cell population. We have shown previously that its expression accompanies <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> cells during migration to the gonads, forming a "travelling niche" that controls their survival, motility, and proliferation. Here we show that these functions are distributed between the alternatively spliced membrane-bound and soluble forms of Steel factor. <b>The</b> <b>germ</b> cells normally migrate as individuals from E 7. 5 to E 11. 5, when they aggregate together in the embryonic gonads. Movie analysis of Steel-dickie mutant embryos, which make only the soluble form, at E 7. 5, showed that <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> cells fail to migrate normally, and undergo "premature aggregation" {{in the base of}} the allantois. Survival and directionality of movement is not affected. Addition of excess soluble Steel factor to Steel-dickie embryos rescued germ cell motility, and addition of Steel factor to germ cells in vitro showed that a fourfold higher dose was required to increase motility, compared to survival. These data show that soluble Steel factor is sufficient for germ cell survival, and suggest that the membrane-bound form provides a higher local concentration of Steel factor that controls <b>the</b> balance between <b>germ</b> cell motility and aggregation. This hypothesis was tested by addition of excess soluble Steel factor to slice cultures of E 11. 5 embryos, when migration usually ceases, and <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> cells aggregate. This reversed the aggregation process, and caused increased motility of <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> cells. We conclude that the two forms of Steel factor control different aspects of germ cell behavior, and that membrane-bound Steel factor controls germ cell motility within a "motility niche" that moves through the embryo with <b>the</b> <b>germ</b> cells. Escape from this niche causes cessation of motility and death by apoptosis of <b>the</b> ectopic <b>germ</b> cells...|$|R
