40|$|Phenol {{formaldehyde}} composites are modified with glycerol/tannin {{mixes with}} varying {{percentage by weight}} of phenolic resin to glycerol/tannin. The glycerol to <b>tannin</b> <b>ratio</b> is also varied. In this work also different percentages by weight of SLG (a commercial ceramic microsphere) {{are added to the}} composites. The effect of glycerol/tannin mix and added SLG on the flexural properties was studied. It was found that the flexural stress decreases gradually with increasing tannin when there is no SLG. With SLG, the presence of tannin in the composites reduces the flexural stress drastically. Tannin reduces the strain at break. With SLG, this reduction of the yield strain is more apparent. Tannin increases the flexural modulus of the composite and SLG acts in the opposite direction. The use of tannin in the phenolic composites improves the ‘green’ character of the composite materials. It was also found that the presence of tannin made the mixing of phenolic resins with glycerol easier...|$|R
40|$|Colophospermum mopane {{trees are}} a common larval food plant of the mopane moth (Imbrasia belina), which {{commonly}} reaches outbreak proportions. Our study investigated factors determining host tree choice by ovipositing mopane moths within a single host species (C. mopane). Tree size was the primary determinant of oviposition at both the habitat (tall riverine-, medium height woodland- and short-shrub mopane) and individual tree scale, {{with an increase in}} the number of egg masses with increasing tree size (estimated by height and canopy volume). Preference for larger trees was only evident at the habitat scale, however, as individual trees were utilized as expected according to the availability of their canopy size class. More detailed tree characteristics, such as leaf size, shoot size, stem number and even leaf chemistry (protein : <b>tannin</b> <b>ratio</b> and total polyphenols) had no influence on host choice. Host choice was based on the most obvious measure of resource abundance, namely tree size, as expected for an outbreak species, since resource availability rather than nutritional quality is likely to be the primary determinant of larval survival...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{previous}} research tannin formaldehyde resin from Acacia decurens bark {{can be used}} for exterior plywood adhesive. To reduce the cost, the effect of urea addition to produce tannin urea formaldeliyde resin has been studied. The other treatment employed is percentage of paraformaldehyde as hardener. The results show that the properties of tannin urea formaldehyde resin conform with Indonesian standard for phenol formaldehyde resin. The effect of weight ratio based on mol ratio on the plywood bonding strenght is significant, while the effect ofpercentage of hardener is not significant. the weight <b>ratio</b> <b>tannin.</b> urea = 1 : 2 with three percentages of hardener meet German standardfor exterior plywood (type AW- 100). The weight <b>ratio</b> <b>tannin</b> urea = 1 = 2, 5 with 2, 5 % and 5 % hardener meet the standard, while the weight ratio tannin:urea = 1 : 3 do not meet the standard. The plywood bonding strenght tends to decrease if using more urea.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out in Kayseri Province of Turkey in the years 2011 and 2012 for two years to {{determine}} the effects of harvest time on hay yield and quality of different bitter vetch genotypes. A total of 16 different bitter vetch (Vicia ervilia L.) lines supplied from EMRI, DATAE and ICARDA were used as the plant material of the field experiments. Experiments were carried out in randomized block design with 3 replications. Bitter vetch lines were harvested at flower-set, full-bloom and podset periods. Green herbage and hay yields, crude protein (CP), protein yield (PY), crude ash (CA), condensed tannin (CT), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) characteristics were investigated. Results revealed increasing ADF-NDF ratios, green herbage and hay yields and decreasing crude protein, crude ash and condensed <b>tannin</b> <b>ratios</b> with the progression of harvest time. Pod-set period was determined as the proper harvest time. The lines VE- 16, VE- 5, VE- 1, VE- 2 and VE- 6 were considered as primary lines to be used in further breeding research and agricultural activities of the region with regard to hay yield and quality...|$|R
40|$|The use of phytogenic dietary {{additives}} {{is being}} evaluated {{as a means}} to improve animal productivity. The effect of tannins seems to be the influence not only directly on the digestive process through binding of dietary proteins but also indirectly over their effects on gastrointestinal microbiota. High-throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA gene was used to analyze the impact of dietary supplementation with a blend of chestnut and quebracho tannins on the rumen microbiota of Holstein steers. Bacterial richness was lower in tannins treated animals, while the overall population structure of rumen microbiota was not significantly disturbed by <b>tannins.</b> The <b>ratio</b> of the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, a parameter associated with energy harvesting function, was increased in tannins supplemented animals, essentially due to the selective growth of Ruminococcaceae over members of genus Prevotella. Fibrolytic, amylolytic, and ureolytic bacterial communities in the rumen were altered by tannins, while methanogenic archaea were reduced. Furthermore, ruminal pH was significantly higher in animals supplemented with tannins than in the control group, while urease activity exhibited the opposite pattern. Further work is necessary to assess the relation between tannins impact on rumen microbiota and alteration of rumen fermentation parameters associated with bovine performance...|$|R
40|$|A pot {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} assess the fertiliser value of faeces from sheep fed with a diet supplemented with legumes free of or containing condensed tannins. Ten animals received the same five diets in different experimental runs of a double Latin Square design, all consisting of a low quality tropical grass ration, supplemented with 450 g/kg legumes. Legume treatments were either solely Vigna unguiculata (a tannin free herbaceous legume) or mixtures of V. unguiculata with either Calliandra calothyrsus or Flemingia macrophylla (both shrub legumes rich in condensed <b>tannins)</b> in <b>ratios</b> of 2 : 1 and 1 : 2. Faeces from animals receiving the same diets were pooled and applied at two levels (20 and 80 mg N/kg soil) to pots with seedlings from the cultivar Mulato II, a Brachiaria grass hybrid. An acidic infertile tropical soil was used. Aerial biomass yield and plant N content were evaluated. The results {{seem to indicate that}} the N fertiliser value of faeces from sheep receiving a diet supplemented with tanniniferous legumes is not substantially reduced compared to diets free of condensed tannins. However, the data also indicate that nitrogen was not the most limiting element in the soil used since mineral fertilisation without extra nitrogen was efficient, too. Peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Flushing and {{fermentation}} {{times are}} the two main parameters determining the quality of black tea. In this research, the effects of different flushing and fermentation times were studied {{on the quality of}} black tea in two clones, 100 and natural Chinese hybrid. Analysis of variance showed there were the significant differences between the clone types, flushing and fermentation times for theaflavin, thearubigin, total color, brightness, tannin and caffeine. Correlation coefficients between all studied traits, except thearubigin and brightness, caffeine and brightness, and total colour and theaflavin/thearubigin ratio, were significant at 1 % probability. Regression analysis indicated there was a significant linear regression between fermentation time and brightness, <b>tannin,</b> and theaflavin/thearubigin <b>ratio.</b> Also, multiple regression analysis for brightness and total colour indicated that more than 70 % of the variation in brightness was explained by theaflavin, caffeine and theaflavin/thearubigin ratio, and more than 68 % of the variation in total colour was because of caffeine and theaflavin/thearubigin ratio...|$|R
40|$|The daily energy {{requirements}} of animals {{are determined by}} a combination of physical and physiological factors, but food availability may challenge the capacity to meet nutritional needs. Western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) are an interesting model for investigating this topic because they are folivore-frugivores that adjust their diet and activities to seasonal variation in fruit availability. Observations of one habituated group of western gorillas in Bai-Hokou, Central African Republic (December 2004 -December 2005) were used to examine seasonal variation in diet quality and nutritional intake. We tested if during the high fruit season the food consumed by western gorillas was higher in quality (higher in energy, sugar, fat but lower in fibre and antifeedants) than during the low fruit season. Food consumed during the high fruit season was higher in digestible energy, but not any other macronutrients. Second, we investigated whether the gorillas increased their daily intake of carbohydrates, metabolizable energy (KCal/g OM), or other nutrients during the high fruit season. Intake of dry matter, fibers, fat, protein and the majority of minerals and phenols decreased with increased frugivory and there was some indication of seasonal variation in intake of energy (KCal/g OM), <b>tannins,</b> protein/fiber <b>ratio,</b> and iron. Intake of non-structural carbohydrates and sugars was not influenced by fruit availability. Gorillas are probably able to extract large quantities of energy via fermentation since they rely on proteinaceous leaves during the low fruit season. Macronutrients and micronutrients, but not digestible energy, may be limited for them during times of low fruit availability because they are hind-gut fermenters. We discuss the advantages of seasonal frugivores having large dietary breath and flexibility, significant characteristics to consider in the conservation strategies of endangered species...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} tannins on ruminal biohydrogenation (BH) due to shifts in the ruminal microbial environment in sheep. Thirteen lambs (45 days of age) were assigned to two dietary treatments: seven lambs were fed a barley-based concentrate (control group) while the other six lambs received the same concentrate with supplemental quebracho tannins (9. 57 % of dry matter). At 122 days of age, the lambs were slaughtered, and the ruminal contents were subjected to fatty acid analysis and sampled to quantify popula- tions of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, which converts C 18 : 2 c 9 -c 12 (linoleic acid [LA]) to C 18 : 2 c 9 -t 11 (rumenic acid [RA]) and then RA to C 18 : 1 t 11 (vaccenic acid [VA]); we also sampled for Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus, which converts VA to C 18 : 0 (stearic acid [SA]). Tannins increased (P < 0. 005) VA in the rumen compared to the tannin-free diet. The concentration of SA was not affected by <b>tannins.</b> The SA/VA <b>ratio</b> was lower (P < 0. 005) for the tannin-fed lambs than for the controls, suggesting that the last step of the BH process was inhibited by tannins. The B. proteoclasticus population was lower (30. 6 %; P < 0. 1), and B. fibrisolvens and protozoan populations were higher (107 % and 56. 1 %, respectively; P < 0. 05) in the rumen of lambs fed the tannin- supplemented diet than in controls. These results suggest that quebracho tannins altered BH by changing ruminal microbial populations...|$|R
40|$|Phenol {{compounds}} in waste water of {{pulp and paper}} industry are toxic and harmful to environment. Phenol compounds are also an expensive chemical with wide range uses, such as raw materials for the manufacture of phenol formaldehyde glue. This experiment was aimed at looking into appropriate method to cope with the problems of black liquor 2 ̆ 7 s phenol by converting it to the most valuable glue largely and widely used in the plywood industries, i. e. phenol-formaldehyde. The experiment was divided into three stages, i. e. (a) recovery of phenol from black liquor after distillation; (b) selecting phenol compounds from another source as an additive to increase the existing phenol concentration in the distilled black liquor; and (c) working out optimum phenol concentration able to develop maximum bonding strength of the phenol-formaldehyde glue. Phenol {{compounds in}}vestigated as an additive to increase distilled phenol concentration are crystal phenol and tannin. The two additives were added in ratio of 1 : 3, 1 : 5 and 1 : 7 (crystal phenol/tannin to distilled phenol). After that, the mixture is reacted with formalin to form phenol formaldehyde glue following standard procedure. The phenol formaldehyde glue was applied to plywood and then was analyzed for moisture content, density and bonding strength. Results showed that phenol crystal addition is better than tannin due to lower in moisture, but higher in density and bonding strength. At all mixture <b>ratio,</b> <b>tannin</b> addition gave lower plywood bonding strength compare to standard (14 kg/cm 2), but phenol addition gave higher plywood bonding strength (18 - 24 kg/cm 2). Further experiment should be conducted to use crystal phenol as an additive to increase distilled phenol concentration...|$|R
