40|$|Common {{approaches}} to hardware implementation of networking components {{start at the}} VHDL level and {{are based on the}} creation of regression <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> to perform simulative validation of functionality.

In this paper, we describe the coupling of a telecommunication network simulator with a VHDL simulator and a hardware test board. This co-verification approach enables the de-signer of hardware for networking components to verify the functional correctness of a device under test against the corresponding algorithmic description and to perform functional chip verification by reusing <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> from a higher level of abstraction. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a new combustion engines is connected with endeavour for escalation of the total efficiency. Escalation of the total efficiency can be: minimization of the mechanical losses in the combustion engines or minimization of the unsuitable equipment capacity of accessories. Now research and development programs of a manufacturer of the combustion engines search effectual equipment and method for this escalation of the total efficiency. The escalation of the total efficiency is important for a minimization fuel consumption and consequently for lower emissions. Turn of the combustion engines is used method for measurement of mechanical losses very often. The paper will show choice of the measurement results on the <b>testing</b> <b>bench.</b> The Technical University of Liberec, Department of Vehicles and Engines, has developed a design of a <b>testing</b> <b>bench</b> which would enable the measuring mechanical losses of the combustion engines for different temperatures of cooling water and engine lubrication oil.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess the {{possible}} effect of engineering and technical services (also known as tech reps) on the maintenance throughput of aircraft components on automatic <b>test</b> equipment (<b>test</b> <b>benches).</b> Correlation techniques and multiple regression models, one for shore-based test equipment and one for afloat-based test equipment. are used to address the primary question asked in thi thesis: Can we measure the effect of Engineering and Technical Services on the throughput rate of aviation depot level repairable items serviced by automatic test equipment (ATE) ? The analysis concludes {{that the effect of}} Engineering and Technical Services can be demonstrated both in the case of shorebased <b>test</b> <b>benches,</b> and ship-based <b>test</b> <b>benches,</b> although the results are not strong enough to base general conclusions.

[Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 19 male soccer players in junior high school.

[Results] There was no significant difference in endur-ance time in the <b>bench</b> <b>test</b> or sideways <b>bench</b> <b>test</b> between the injury group (n= 9) and non-injury group (n= 10). Comparison within each group revealed no significant difference in endurance time between the right and left sideways <b>bench</b> <b>tests</b> in the non-injury group; however, the time in the left sideways <b>bench</b> <b>test</b> was significantly longer than that in the right in the injury group.
