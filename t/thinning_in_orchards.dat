40|$|Thinning trials with vinasse in {{comparison}} to lime sulphur were carried out for 4 years at different sites in South Tyrol. Beside the thinning effect, the influence on fruit quality, phytotoxic damage on the leaves and the return bloom of treated trees were evaluated. Depending on the dosage the vinasse treatments showed a good thinning effect, but russetting and leave damages were significantly higher {{in comparison}} to lime sulphur. Return bloom of vinasse treated trees was lower than of those treated with lime sulphur. In conclusion, vinasse treatments can not substitute lime sulphur for flower <b>thinning</b> <b>in</b> organic apple <b>orchards...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Washington State UniversityManaging crop load of {{commercial}} tree fruit species, such as sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.), apple (Malus domestica Borkh.), pear (Pyrus communis), by thinning bloom, {{is a common}} practice used to produce larger and better quality fruit. Targeted mechanical thinning may be preferential compared to current chemical and manual strategies and decrease production costs. This study aimed to develop a hand-held mechanical thinning device suitable for targeted thinning blossoms on sweet cherry trees regardless of tree architecture. Research prototypes of different configurations have been designed, fabricated, and tested in laboratory and <b>in</b> <b>orchards.</b> Field testing results from both research and commercial orchards verified the efficacy of these prototypes as blossom thinners - flowers were removed effectively {{with a range of}} configurations. I conducted a parametric study that investigated a range of configurations for thinning spindle evaluating the torque, speed variation and power consumption under laboratory conditions based on a developed platform and data acquisition system, which simulated different blossom <b>thinning</b> conditions <b>in</b> the <b>orchard</b> and let desired parameters measurable. Power consumption and torque variation to string stiffness were obtained to provide crucial information assisting motor and battery sizing for product commercialization. Another parametric study for evaluating flower removal percentage in relation to a set of key operation parameters - spindle rotating speed, swiping speed and thinning distance - was conducted <b>in</b> sweet cherry <b>orchard.</b> Results indicated that stiffness of thinning strings affected the controllability of flower removal percentage. Flower removal percentage could be better controlled when strings that were less rigid were utilized. Of all studied parameters of the thinning spindle, rotating speed of the thinning spindle was the most important and was related positively to flower removal percentage.

40|$|Benzyladenine (BA) is a {{well known}} {{synthetic}} cytokinin broadly used as a <b>thinning</b> agent <b>in</b> apple <b>orchards.</b> BA has numerous physiological effects, strictly dependent upon the tree developmental stage, the concentration of the chemical and the environmental conditions {{at the time of}} spraying. The enhanced ethylene evolution observed in BA-treated apple leaves and fruits {{may be one of the}} key factors that trigger the physiological processes leading to fruitlet abscission. In order to shed light on the ethylene-related events occurring during abscission, a timecourse model for BA action was developed based upon physiological data obtained by combining the use of BA either with AVG (aminoethoxyvinylglycine), or 1 -MCP (1 -methylcyclopropene), blocking ethylene biosynthesis and perception, respectively. The results confirm the bimodal action of BA through ethylene, acting first on shoot growth and then, most likely indirectly, promoting fruitlet abscission. Based on a 24 hours-resolution time-course, a very fast action of BA was observed within 24 h from the treatment. A parallel antagonist effect was exerted by AVG within 24 - 48 h. This model, currently under validation, was confirmed to be a very reliable system for studying fruitlet abscission in apple...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), a {{synthetic}} auxin analogue, {{is widely used}} as an effective <b>thinner</b> <b>in</b> apple <b>orchards.</b> When applied shortly after fruit set, some fruit abscise leading to improved fruit size and quality. However, the thinning results of NAA are inconsistent and difficult to predict, sometimes leading to excess fruit drop or insufficient thinning which are costly to growers. This unpredictability reflects our incomplete understanding of the mode of action of NAA in promoting fruit abscission. Results Here we compared NAA-induced fruit drop with that caused by shading via gene expression profiling performed on the fruit abscission zone (FAZ), sampled 1, 3, and 5 d after treatment. More than 700 genes with significant changes in transcript abundance were identified from NAA-treated FAZ. Combining results from both treatments, we found that genes associated with photosynthesis, cell cycle and membrane/cellular trafficking were downregulated. On the other hand, there was up-regulation of genes related to ABA, ethylene biosynthesis and signaling, cell wall degradation and programmed cell death. While the differentially expressed gene sets for NAA and shading treatments shared only 25 % identity, NAA and shading showed substantial similarity {{with respect to the}} classes of genes identified. Specifically, photosynthesis, carbon utilization, ABA and ethylene pathways were affected in both NAA- and shading-induced young fruit abscission. Moreover, we found that NAA, similar to shading, directly interfered with leaf photosynthesis by repressing photosystem II (PSII) efficiency within 10 minutes of treatment, suggesting that NAA and shading induced some of the same early responses due to reduced photosynthesis, which concurred with changes in hormone signaling pathways and triggered fruit abscission. Conclusions This study provides an extensive transcriptome study and a good platform for further investigation of possible regulatory genes involved in the induction of young fruit abscission in apple, which will enable us to better understand the mechanism of fruit thinning and facilitate the selection of potential chemicals for the <b>thinning</b> programs <b>in</b> apple. </p...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{substantial}} {{consumer demand}} {{and willingness to}} pay premium prices for organically grown fruit, apple growers in Vermont and other New England states {{have been slow to}} adopt certified organic practices. Barriers cited in the past to increased adoption of organic apple production in the region include susceptibility of traditionally grown cultivars to apple scab, lack of effective insect pest management materials, and few available effective options for fruit <b>thinning.</b> Recent changes <b>in</b> apple cultivar plantings in the region, introduction of new insect pest management materials, and advances <b>in</b> crop <b>thinning</b> justified an evaluation of organic apple production systems containing cultivars identified as important {{to the future of the}} apple industry. In 2006, two apple orchards were established at the University of Vermont Horticulture Research and Education Center in South Burlington, VT to comprehensively evaluate the five commercially-important apple cultivars of `Ginger Gold 2 ̆ 7, `Honeycrisp 2 ̆ 7, `Liberty 2 ̆ 7, `Macoun 2 ̆ 7, and `Zestar! 2 ̆ 7 over eight growing seasons <b>in</b> two organically-managed <b>orchard</b> production systems, including a newly-planted high-density orchard (<b>Orchard</b> 1) and <b>in</b> an existing, medium-density orchard which was top-grafted to the new cultivars (Orchard 2). Parameters for tree growth and survival, crop yield, disease and arthropod pest incidence on foliage and fruit, and long-term economic return, including a twenty-year projection of net present value (NPV) of each cultivar in the two systems were evaluated in this study. `Ginger Gold 2 ̆ 7, despite high incidence of some diseases on foliage and fruit, performed the best <b>in</b> both <b>orchard</b> systems overall. The cultivar was among the cultivars with the highest measurements of tree growth. `Ginger Gold 2 ̆ 7, along with `Honeycrisp 2 ̆ 7, had the highest cumulative net crop yield per tree <b>in</b> <b>Orchard</b> 1 and the highest <b>in</b> <b>Orchard</b> 2. Notably, apple scab on `Honeycrisp 2 ̆ 7 foliage and fruit and `Zestar! 2 ̆ 7 fruit <b>in</b> both <b>orchards</b> was at a level that was not significantly different from `Liberty 2 ̆ 7, a scab-resistant cultivar on which no scab was observed. However, `Honeycrisp 2 ̆ 7 had the highest incidence of fruit rots <b>in</b> both <b>orchards,</b> but it was not significantly different than `Zestar! 2 ̆ 7 <b>in</b> <b>Orchard</b> 1. Management of lepidopteran pests of fruit was a major challenge on all cultivars over the years of the study. For most of the tree growth parameters and cumulative net crop yield, `Liberty 2 ̆ 7 was among the lowest group of cultivars <b>in</b> both <b>orchards.</b> Cumulative net crop yield of both `Macoun 2 ̆ 7 and `Zestar! 2 ̆ 7 were also among the lowest <b>in</b> both <b>orchards</b> with the top-grafted `Macoun 2 ̆ 7 and `Zestar! 2 ̆ 7 trees having significant tree death compared to the other cultivars <b>in</b> <b>Orchard</b> 2. Harvested fruit were graded to commercial standards and cumulative gross and net income calculated from grade distribution, crop yield, and fruit price data. <b>In</b> <b>Orchard</b> 1, `Ginger Gold 2 ̆ 7 and `Liberty 2 ̆ 7 had greater cumulative gross income per hectare from 2006 - 2013, in excess of US 40, 000, compared to `Liberty 2 ̆ 7. However, after management costs were deducted, all cultivars <b>in</b> <b>Orchard</b> 1 had negative cumulative net income of - 77, 892 or less. <b>In</b> <b>Orchard</b> 2, all cultivars had positive cumulative net income for 2006 - 2013, and `Ginger Gold 2 ̆ 7 had the highest at 109, 717 /ha.

40|$|Flower strips {{are widely}} {{recommended}} {{as a tool}} to boost insect pollinators and yield in pollinator-dependent crops. Using UK cider apple orchards (Malus domestica Borkhausen) as a model system, we assessed whether flower strips increased pollination services <b>in</b> <b>orchards.</b> Pollinator communities (visual observation) and pollination services (fruit set) were assessed at increasing distance from surrounding semi-natural habitats (0 – 200 m) <b>in</b> eight <b>orchards.</b> <b>In</b> four <b>orchards,</b> perennial flower strips had been established and bloomed in the year before the main experiment. In a separate experiment, insect visits to apple flowers were observed to investigate possible functional mechanisms underpinning pollinator efficacy. The visit rate of wild insects to apple flowers (non-Apis bees and flies), but not that of honeybees (Apis mellifera L.), increased by 40 % <b>in</b> flower strip <b>orchards</b> compared to control <b>orchards,</b> particularly <b>in</b> areas close to semi-natural habitat (< 100 m). Wild insect visitation was also positively related to dandelion (Taraxacum species) abundance <b>in</b> <b>orchards.</b> Fruit set <b>in</b> <b>orchards</b> was positively related to wild insect richness, and andrenid bee (Andrena species) visitation, but neither richness nor andrenid bee visit rate responded positively to flower strips. Wild bees (andrenid bees and bumblebees (Bombus species)) contacted apple stigma (95 and 100 % of visits) more often than honeybees (81 %), but only bumblebees moved frequently between different tree rows, an important trait for transfer of compatible pollen in apples. Our results demonstrate that flower strips enhanced overall wild insect abundance but not pollination services <b>in</b> cider <b>orchards.</b> Positive effects of ground flora on wild insect abundance <b>in</b> <b>orchards</b> suggest that flower mixtures or orchard management could be optimised for andrenid bees, the single most important pollinator taxa, by increasing the availability of early-flowering plants <b>in</b> <b>orchards.</b> Equally, wild insect richness was highest in areas close to semi-natural habitats. Therefore, whilst flower strips can boost abundance of the existing species pool, only large scale preservation of (semi-) natural habitat will maintain pollinator diversity <b>in</b> apple <b>orchards...</b>|$|R
