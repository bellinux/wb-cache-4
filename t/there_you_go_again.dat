50|$|The album showcased Kershaw's {{frustration}} at the time, with subjects of integrity - media scepticism (particularly towards tabloid journalism), privacy, insecurity and mass-produced run-of-the-mill pop music ("Why can't you {{let us do}} it like Joni does it? <b>There</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>again,</b> giving it your very best - {{trying so hard to}} make it sound like all the rest"). The subject is reflected in the cover artwork's concept.

40|$|Price-concentration {{studies are}} {{important}} because they are widely seen as supporting the standard prediction that high seller concentration tends to harm consumers and because both antitrust agencies use them in assessing horizontal mergers. But price-concentration studies are severely flawed. In industries in which sellers compete on quality and amenities, a positive price-concentration relation could result, not from coordinated effects, but from competitive superiority. Since such nonprice competition is ubiquitous and is usually intense, this poses a significant problem of interpretation. Further, non-price competition cannot be controlled for statistically, as is frequently assumed. Even if sellers compete exclusively on price, priceconcentration studies are still severely flawed. Differences in market size could induce a positive price-concentration relationship, but as with competitive superiority, a priceconcentration relationship resulting from this cause does not imply consumers are being harmed. Market size differences may well account for the observations that the FTC attributed to non-competitive behavior in Staples. The paper concludes with some suggestions for improving price-concentration studies and for further research. 1 Price-Concentration Studies: <b>There</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Again</b> Stylized Fact 5. 1 : In cross-section comparisons involving markets in the same industry, seller concentration is positive related {{to the level of}} price [...] The relation between concentration and price seems much more robust statistically than that between concentration and profitability. Since studies of price have fewer obvious weaknesses than studies of profitability, Stylized Fact 5. 1 seems to provide the best evidence in support of the concentration-collusion hypothesis [footnote omitted]. Richard Schmalensee (1989, p. 988) In this study, and several others in this book, it is clear that concentration does raise price. The basic hypothesis of oligopoly theory has lots of support. Our two-decade digression on concentration and profits and our subsequent 13 years of doubt were unnecessary...|$|E
