5|$|Although {{the airport}} is capable of {{handling}} Boeing 767 aircraft, for large numbers of these aircraft, significant investment would be needed. Consequently, the largest aircraft regularly flying to the airport are Boeing 757. The main problem at {{the airport is}} the lack of ramp space, with just two parking positions for large aircraft. As a result, El Al operates regular shuttle flights <b>to</b> <b>Ben</b> Gurion International Airport carrying passengers from around the world on 757s and 737s.|$|E

5|$|Early in his career, Sanchez {{was praised}} {{for his ability}} to {{maintain}} composure in the pocket amidst defensive pressure and focus on finding an open receiver to extend the team's offensive series. In his four-year career, Sanchez has had ten fourth quarter comebacks and twelve game winning drives. These characteristics were highlighted by Bill Parcells and Sam Wyche and garnered comparisons <b>to</b> <b>Ben</b> Roethlisberger. Sanchez was also noted for his proficiency in short passing situations and competitive nature; in December 2010, following dismal performances, Rex Ryan threatened to reduce Sanchez's repetitions with the first team offense during practice which infuriated Sanchez.|$|E

5|$|Stuart Lake {{described}} {{in his book}} how Earp single-handedly stood down a large crowd that wanted to lynch gambler Michael O'Rourke (Johnny Behind the Deuce). O'Rourke had killed Henry Schneider, chief engineer of the Tombstone Mining and Milling Company—he said in self defense. Henry was well-liked, and a mob of miners quickly gathered, threatening to lynch O'Rourke on the spot. In fact, the Epitaph gave primary credit <b>to</b> <b>Ben</b> Sippy for standing down the crowd, assisted by Virgil Earp, Wyatt Earp, and Johnny Behan. This incident as described by Lake added to Earp's modern legend as a lawman.|$|E
5|$|The {{fate of the}} D-21 {{that had}} {{disappeared}} on the first operational flight was finally revealed in February 1986 when an official from the CIA returned a panel <b>to</b> <b>Ben</b> Rich {{that he had been}} given by a Soviet KGB agent. The drone had self-destructed over Siberia and the Soviets had recovered the wreckage. The Tupolev design bureau reverse-engineered the wreck and produced plans for a Soviet copy, named the Voron (Raven), but it was never built.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} of Spin Alternative Record Guide was {{published}} on October 10, 1995, by Vintage Books. It was the first book compiled by Spin. Having edited their book, Weisbard put his pursuit of a PhD at UC Berkeley on hold and accepted a job offer from the magazine, which {{marked the beginning of}} his career as a rock critic. Although the book did not sell well, its entry on 1960s folk artist John Fahey, written by Byron Coley, helped renew interest in Fahey's music. According <b>to</b> <b>Ben</b> Ratliff from The New York Times, this led to substantial interest in Fahey from record labels and the alternative music scene, helping revive his career.|$|E

5|$|Despite Toronto's {{improved}} defensive performances, Carter's offence was sorely {{missed in}} the first-round {{series against the}} second-seeded Detroit Pistons. In the first game, Detroit overwhelmed Toronto 83–65, largely due <b>to</b> <b>Ben</b> Wallace's strong performance of 19 points, 20 rebounds, 3 blocks and 3 steals. Detroit also won Game 2, but Toronto won the next two games at home to force a deciding and tightly contested Game 5 in Detroit. With 10.7 {{seconds left in the}} game, and the Raptors down 85–82 with possession of the ball, Childs raced down the court and shot a three-pointer that missed badly, apparently trying to draw a foul on the play, instead of passing to a wide-open Curry. In a post-game locker room interview, Childs repeatedly insisted that the Raptors had been down four points, not three. The Raptors' late-season surge was thus marred by a disappointing playoff exit; the Olajuwon experiment was also a bust, with the 39-year-old averaging career lows in minutes, points and rebounds. Furthermore, Childs, Clark and Curry left the team, ensuring a new-look team for the next season.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 Lê Duẩn was {{appointed}} to the Secretariat. Lê Duẩn was ordered by the Politburo in August 1956 to guide the revolutionary struggle in South Vietnam. The same month he traveled from U Minh <b>to</b> <b>Bến</b> Tre and instructed the southern communists to stop fighting in the name of religious sects. Throughout the year, the party had been split by factional rivalry between party boss Trường Chinh and President Hồ, who was supported by Võ Nguyên Giáp. This rivalry focused on the issue of land reform in the North. Lê Duẩn remained neutral, allowing him to act as the First Secretary (head of the Communist Party) on Hồ's behalf in late 1956. In 1957, he was given a seat in the Politburo.|$|E

5|$|John Boehner, {{a member}} of the Republican Party from Ohio, served as the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives from February 2006 until January 2007. As the Democratic Party assumed control of the House {{following}} the 2006 elections, Boehner served as Minority Leader from January 2007 until January 2011. When Republicans reassumed control of the House of Representatives in January 2011, Boehner was elected as Speaker, with the votes of all 241 of his fellow Republicans. In 2014, some House Republicans reached out <b>to</b> <b>Ben</b> Carson about his interest in becoming Speaker should they be able to oust Boehner; Carson declined, citing his impending candidacy for president. Boehner's Republican opponents formed a congressional caucus, called the Freedom Caucus, in January 2015 to focus their opposition. Though Boehner was reelected as Speaker {{at the beginning of the}} 114th United States Congress that month, 25 conservative members of the Republican caucus did not vote for him. Daniel Webster, a Republican from Florida, received 12 votes.|$|E
5|$|Parslow and McGurk were {{appointed}} as club captains for 2009–10, although Parslow {{would continue to}} wear the armband in matches. He signed a new contract with York in January 2010 to tie him to the club until the summer of 2012. He played in the team as a centre back and right back before losing his place <b>to</b> <b>Ben</b> Purkiss after picking up a foot injury in York's 2–1 away defeat to Forest Green Rovers on 6 March 2010, with the captain's armband being handed to Michael Ingham. He made his return in York's 1–0 away defeat by Stevenage in the last league match of 2009–10 on 24 April 2010, but was dropped to the bench for the play-off semi-final 1–0 victory at home to Luton Town. Parslow appeared as a 90-minute substitute in the second leg 1–0 away win, with the tie ending 2–0 on aggregate. However, he was an unused substitute for the 3–1 defeat by Oxford United at Wembley Stadium in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final. He made 41 appearances for York in 2009–10.|$|E
