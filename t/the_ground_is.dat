25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1876 as a race course. There was no {{permanent}} pavilion until 1892, when a ‘grand stand’ was built {{according to a}} suggestion of Mr. P A Templer, the then Secretary of the Galle Municipal Council.

5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs {{engage in}} several {{displays}} during fights, hunting, or self-defence. Prior to a sprint, the cheetah {{will hold its}} head down, with aggression on its face, and approach the target in a stiff gait. The aggressive expression is maintained during the run. To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls. In more severe cases, <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> hit with the paws. Fights are characterised by biting, tearing out the fur and attempts at strangling on both sides.|$|E
5|$|Director Harry Morris {{identified}} {{a site for}} a new ground in Bordesley Green, some three-quarters of a mile(1km) from Muntz Street towards the city centre. The site was where a brickworks once operated; the land sloped steeply down to stagnant pools, yet the stadium was constructed in under twelve months from land clearance to opening ceremony on Boxing Day 1906. Heavy snow nearly prevented the opening; volunteers had to clear pitch and terraces before the match, a goalless draw against Middlesbrough, could go ahead. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> reputed to have been cursed by gypsies evicted from the site; although gypsies {{are known to have}} camped nearby, there is no contemporary evidence for their eviction by the club.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>was</b> {{most notable}} {{as the home}} of the Yarraville Football Club {{throughout}} almost its entire existence in both the Victorian Junior Football Association from 1903 until 1927, and then in the Victorian Football Association from 1928 until 1982; the club played its games at the Western Oval in its final season in 1983. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>was</b> originally managed by a group of trustees, but management of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>was</b> transferred to <b>the</b> Footscray Council in 1928 to enable <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> to <b>be</b> upgraded to Association standards. The City of Maribyrnong, which incorporates the former City of Footscray, remains <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> manager.|$|R
50|$|Ellerman Lines Cricket <b>Ground</b> <b>was</b> a cricket <b>ground</b> at <b>the</b> end of Carr Lane in Hoylake, Cheshire, now in Merseyside. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>was</b> {{surrounded}} by countryside {{on at least}} three sides, with the houses in George Road along the western flank of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> built {{at some point during}} the period when <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>was</b> in use. <b>The</b> cricket <b>ground</b> has <b>been</b> disused for approximately forty years.|$|R

The stadium is shared with a local junior team, Moston Juniors F.C.|$|E
5|$|Heating is {{cost-effective}} at {{many more}} sites than electricity generation. At natural hot springs or geysers, {{water can be}} piped directly into radiators. In hot, dry ground, earth tubes or downhole heat exchangers can collect the heat. However, even in areas where <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> colder than room temperature, heat can often be extracted with a geothermal heat pump more cost-effectively and cleanly than by conventional furnaces. These devices draw on much shallower and colder resources than traditional geothermal techniques. They frequently combine functions, including air conditioning, seasonal thermal energy storage, solar energy collection, and electric heating. Heat pumps {{can be used for}} space heating essentially anywhere.|$|E
5|$|Quarrying in Giffnock {{continued}} until 1912 when, due to flooding {{and the high}} cost of extracting stone, work ceased. Numerous ventures tried to revitalise the quarries for other purposes, including the cultivation of mushrooms in the tunnels. As the pits began to fill with water, it became an issue that needed to be resolved. In the early 1930s, William Bearmore & Co began tipping slag from the production of steel into the Giffnock quarries. The slag tipping {{continued until}} 1969, when Derek Crouch Limited began scrap metal extraction, which lasted until the late 1970s. Today <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> a wasteland.|$|E
5000|$|In local {{domestic}} cricket, <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> home <b>ground</b> of South Leinster, {{as well as}} Carlisle Cricket Club.

50|$|The final {{recorded}} {{match on}} <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> came in 1891 when Castleton played Burnley. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>was</b> later required for building and built over. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>was</b> located to <b>the</b> south Sparth Bottoms Road, an area which is today covered by industrial units following {{the closure of}} <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in 1965.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Victoria <b>Ground</b> <b>is</b> a cricket <b>ground</b> in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. The first {{recorded}} match on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>was</b> in 1893, when Cheltenham played East Gloucestershire.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> {{known for}} the {{artificial}} playing surface which was present from 1985 to 1991, the unusual entrance to the Oak Road End, and the five-season ban on away supporters that Luton Town imposed following a riot by visiting fans in 1985. Floodlights were fitted in 1953, and the ground became all-seated in 1986. The record attendance of 30,069 was set in 1959, in an FA Cup sixth round replay against Blackpool.|$|E
5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} occurs in several habitats, ranging from coastal salt marshes to {{mountain}} streams and clearings. It is semiaquatic, spending {{much time in}} the water, and usually occurs in wetland habitats. It prefers areas where <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> covered with grasses and sedges, which protect it from predators. In southern Illinois, marsh rice rats are more likely to occur in wetlands with more herbaceous cover, visual obstruction, and nearby grasslands. The species also occurs in drier uplands, which serve as sinks for young, dispersing animals and as refuges during high tide. Rice rats are adept overwater dispersers; studies on islands off Virginia's Delmarva Peninsula show that they readily cross 300-m (1000ft) channels between islands.|$|E
5|$|The northernmost {{stand of}} <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> the David Longhurst Stand, {{which is a}} covered terrace for home {{supporters}} and has a row of supporting pillars across its front. The stand was originally known as the Shipton Street End, but was renamed {{following the death of}} David Longhurst, and has a capacity of 3,062. Opposite is the Grosvenor Road End, an open terrace reserved for away supporters, which holds a capacity of 1,785. As well as this, away fans are permitted to use 332 seats of the Popular Stand, in the section closest to the Grosvenor Road End. The toilet facilities for away supporters consist of open air urinals for men and Portakabins for women.|$|E
50|$|During its existence, <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> home venue of Westerns Cricket Club. Westerns {{played the}} final {{recorded}} match held on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in 1881 when they played Cheshire. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>was</b> located at <b>the</b> {{eastern end of}} Barton Lane and is today covered by housing.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>was</b> cleared in 1898 to form {{a series}} of cricket fields. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>was</b> named in honour of the Duke of Wellington, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom {{at the time of}} the {{settlement}} of the Swan River Colony.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>was</b> sold to Thor Specialities Ltd in January 2012 and the {{football}} club {{were forced to}} leave the stadium. Assets from <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>are</b> set to be sold, with Cheshire West and Chester Council benefitting from the sale money.|$|R
