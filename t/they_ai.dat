We describe the history and challenges of both AI and ICT 4 D research, and present three broad suggestions for AI-for-development researchers: (1) that they spend as much time as possible with the kind of site or the organization they are hoping to impact; (2) that they be ambitious but humble in their goals and expectations; and (3) that <b>they</b> put <b>AI</b> in the service of existing, well-intented, competent development organizations.
