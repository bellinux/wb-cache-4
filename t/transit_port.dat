5|$|When the 3rd Infantry {{landed at}} Licata, Sicily, on 10 July, Murphy was a {{division}} runner. On a scouting patrol, he killed two fleeing Italian officers near Canicattì. Sidelined with illness {{for a week}} when Company B arrived in Palermo on 20 July, he rejoined {{them when they were}} assigned to a hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement, {{while the rest of the}} 3rd Infantry Division fought at San Fratello en route to the Allied capture of the <b>transit</b> <b>port</b> of Messina.|$|E
5|$|As previous, the Swedish {{authorities}} {{continued to}} subsidize freight operations on their side, making it profitable for Swedish exports to go via the Baltic Sea. Hopes in Trondheim {{to act as}} a major <b>transit</b> <b>port</b> for Swedish cargo never materialized. The 1966 opening of Norske Skog Skogn paper mill saw an increase in transport of lumber from Sweden. The petroleum transport lasted until the 1980s, when the Muruvik terminal was sold to Norwegian interests. A major customer was still Meråker Smelteverk, who used designated trains to haul ore from Muruvik to Kopperå and microsilica in return. By 1980, cargo volumes were up to the level seen during World War I.|$|E
25|$|In 1591 Maurice of Orange, the Dutch Republics {{military}} commander had led a successful campaign, {{in which he}} had captured several important cities culminating in the capture of Nijmegen in October that year. During that campaign he had also captured Delfzijl, and meant Groningen the capital of Drenthe, being stripped of its main <b>transit</b> <b>port.</b> The ultimate goal of Maurice was to take that city in 1591 but the defensvies looked too strong. Therefore, in 1592 he began by besieging and taking Steenwijk so that Grongingen would grow weaker.|$|E

However, the end of World War I saw Smirnov demobilized from the Royal Air Force.|$|R
25|$|From 1848 {{to about}} the early 1870s, Macau was the infamous <b>transit</b> <b>port</b> of a trade of coolies (or slave labourers) from {{southern}} China. Most of them were kidnapped from the Guangdong province and were shipped off in packed vessels to Cuba, Peru, or other South American ports to work on plantations or in mines. Many died on the way there due to malnutrition, disease, or other mistreatment. The Dea del Mar which had set sail to Callao from Macau in 1865 with 550 Chinese on board, arrived in Tahiti with only 162 of them still alive.|$|E
500|$|They {{arrived in}} Palermo on 20 July, and Murphy was sidelined by illness for a week. Allied {{capture of the}} <b>transit</b> <b>port</b> of Messina was crucial to taking Sicily from the Axis. En route there, Company B was {{assigned}} to a hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement, {{while the rest of}} the 3rd Infantry Division fought at San Fratello. The Axis began their evacuation of Messina on 27 July. Although the 3rd Infantry Division's 7th Infantry Regiment secured the port on 17 August, the Axis had already completed their evacuation hours before. During the fighting in Sicily, Murphy became realistic about military duty: [...] "I have seen war as it actually is, and I do not like it. But I will go on fighting." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} spatial {{evolution}} of inter-Korean maritime connections {{for the last}} two decades. Based on the circulation pattern and capacity of trading vessels ‟ movements, it applies the Gini coefficient to the ring of external ports connecting North Korea to the outside world. Results show the gradual isolation of North Korea and the increased importance of neighboring <b>transit</b> <b>ports</b> through three main stages. First, traffics concentrate in global hub ports (Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japanese ports). Second, traffics split and spread to closer and smaller <b>transit</b> <b>ports</b> (Busan, Dalian, Nakhodka). Third, traffics re-concentrate upon Incheon, South Korea, which has become the dominant load center of the North in recent years. One difficulty is therefore whether such spatial shift should be attributed to the betterment of inter-Korean relationships (e. g. 2000 summit, maritime agreement) or to the internal problems of North Korea in terms of infrastructure decay and lacks of handling capacity at its ports. Such research allows complementing port concentration studies by analyzing external hub dependence {{in the case of a}} collapsing and increasingly isolated economy...|$|R

50|$|Travelers on {{long-haul}} routes with {{at least}} one transit stop between their departure airport and destination airport should be careful to purchase their duty-free alcohol or perfume at the last <b>transit</b> <b>port,</b> as otherwise they may have it confiscated by security when they board at the <b>transit</b> <b>port,</b> as they will be exceeding the current limit on liquids in hand baggage. This does not apply to passengers transferring within the EU and Singapore on the same day, as long as the liquid item is sealed in a plastic bag with the receipt showing in the bag. Arrivals duty-free shops are now becoming more common. Most of South and Central America, and the Caribbean have such shops, as does SE Asia and Oceania. Switzerland and Canada are looking to introduce them in 2010. This method of retail removes any security problems with the transit of liquids, as they are not carried on aircraft.|$|E
