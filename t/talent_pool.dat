5|$|The telethon's <b>talent</b> <b>pool</b> {{becomes so}} low that Leslie is forced to flip a coin {{in front of the}} camera and talk about her {{favorite}} episodes of Friends. Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is allowed to play the piano, but everyone dismisses his skilled playing as a racket. Mark finally returns to propose and walks on the set with the ring, but Leslie stops him by mooning the camera. Detlef Schrempf and Tom finally arrive at the end of Leslie's programming block. Detlef presents a check for $5,000, allowing the telethon to bypass its $20,000 mark. Despite being awake for two days straight, Leslie goes to Ann's house so they could talk about Mark. She then promptly falls asleep on Ann's couch for 22 hours.|$|E
5|$|When the WHA ceased {{operations}} in 1979, the NHL absorbed {{four of the}} league's teams, which brought the NHL to 21 teams, a figure that remained constant until the San Jose Sharks were added as an expansion franchise in 1991. Since then, the league has grown from 22 teams in 1992 to 31 today as the NHL spread its footprint across the United States. The league has withstood major labour conflicts in 1994–95 and 2004–05, the latter of which saw the entire 2004–05 NHL season canceled, {{the first time in}} North American history that a league has canceled an entire season in a labour dispute. Wayne Gretzky passed Gordie Howe as the NHL's all-time leading scorer in 1994 when he scored his 802nd career goal. Mario Lemieux overcame non-Hodgkin lymphoma to finish his NHL career with over 1,700 points and two Stanley Cup championships. Increased use of defence-focused systems helped cause scoring to fall in the late 1990s, leading some to argue that the NHL's <b>talent</b> <b>pool</b> had been diluted by 1990s expansion. In 1998, the NHL began awarding teams a single point for losing in overtime, hoping {{to reduce the number of}} tie games; after the 2004–05 lockout, it eliminated the tie altogether, introducing the shootout to ensure that each game has a winner.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Global talent {{management}} {{has been widely}} discussed in academia {{during the last decade}} and is described as one of the keys for future success. Nevertheless the methods and procedures for the best practices are still not fully understood. This study focuses on the use of global <b>talent</b> <b>pools</b> for which multinational corporations (MNC) establish groups of individuals foreseen to take on important roles in the top tier management of the organization. Earlier researches are lacking to explain how these pools are established and for what purpose. By investigating a number of global MNCs this study shows that the creation of global <b>talent</b> <b>pools</b> not only focuses on human capital retention but also is a tool used to emphasize control of subsidiaries creating a role somewhat similar to expats. Furthermore by gathering <b>talents</b> into <b>pools,</b> social bonds between the members are formed which are seen as very valuable for forming an inter-organizational network. Another important aspect from the research findings is the homogeneity of people in these groups where mid-age Caucasian men dominate, highlighting the failure in fulfilling company diversity goals.

Imported American and British programs benefited from high budgets, an international <b>talent</b> <b>pool</b> and huge economies of scale, thanks to their very large domestic markets (relative to Australia), established worldwide distribution networks; additionally, since most American production houses and networks were based in Los Angeles, they had access to resources and expertise built up over decades by the Hollywood movie studios. These disadvantages were further exacerbated {{by the fact that}} American producers and networks offered Australian channels significant discount rates on bundled programming. Taken as a whole, these factors meant that local producers were faced with a relative production-cost ratio on the order of 10:1 or more in favour of the imported product.|$|E

40|$|This {{conceptual}} paper {{explores the}} relationship between an organization’s exclusive talent management (TM) practices, employees’ perceptions of the fairness of exclusive TM practices, and the corresponding impact on employee engagement. We propose that in organizations pursuing exclusive TM programs, employee perceptions of organizational justice of the exclusive TM practices may affect their employee engagement, which may influence both organizational and employee outcomes. Building on extant research, we present a conceptual framework depicting {{the relationship between}} exclusive TM practices, organizational justice and employee engagement, with social exchange theory and equity theory as the frame- work’s foundation. The propositions in the framework are each supported by the respective literature. The perceived organizational justice and potential ramifications of exclusive TM practices for employees who are not inclu- ded in corporate <b>talent</b> <b>pools</b> is an under-researched topic. The paper considers the perspectives of employees not included in corporate <b>talent</b> <b>pools</b> and explores how exclusive TM practices, as inputs, could lead to negative employee engagement outputs. In unpacking how exclu- sive TM practices could impact on employee engagement, the implications for organizations are underlined. The ethics and perceived fairness of exclusive TM practices, which {{have the potential to}} marginalize employees and lead to their disengagement, are considered...|$|R
