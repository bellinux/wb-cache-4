50|$|The {{practice}} of recording and editing audio using magnetic tape rapidly established {{itself as an}} obvious improvement over previous methods. Many saw the potential of making the same improvements in recording television. Television ("video") signals are similar to audio signals. A major difference is that video signals use more bandwidth than audio signals. Existing audio tape recorders could not practically capture a video signal. Many set to work on resolving this problem. Jack Mullin (working for Bing Crosby) and the BBC both created crude working systems that involved moving the tape across a fixed tape head at very fast speeds. Neither system saw much use. It was the team at Ampex, led by Charles Ginsburg, that made the breakthrough of using a spinning recording head and normal tape speeds to achieve a very high head-to-tape speed that could record and reproduce the high bandwidth signals of video. The Ampex system was called Quadruplex and used 2 in <b>tape,</b> <b>mounted</b> on reels like audio tape, which wrote the signal {{in what is now}} called transverse scan.|$|E

50|$|To {{achieve the}} {{required}} efficiencies, CSG developed its own Pre-Scan {{software for the}} IBM MVS Operating System. This software facilitated tape drives being pre-allocated and tape files pre-mounted by tape operators as a job was read into the job scheduler. (Two Job Execution Schedulers were available from IBM; JES2 which read in the job, created a job address space in memory, and then waited for the requested job resources (tape drive, <b>tape</b> file <b>mounted</b> on drive, ready to read/write) were physically available before starting job execution; and JES3, where the job would be read in by the system, then wait until the requested job resources were physically available and allocated before creating a job address space in memory to begin execution). CSG's Pre-Scan would read in the job control language statements, parse the necessary resources required to execute the job, then dynamically allocate the physical devices, request the <b>tape</b> <b>mounts,</b> all while the system created the job address space in memory. The net result was significantly faster and more efficient throughput by eliminating / minimizing wait times.|$|R

40|$|It is {{now known}} that the {{equations}} of motion for the contact point during peeling of an adhesive <b>tape</b> <b>mounted</b> on a roll introduced earlier are singular and do not support dynamical jumps across the two stable branches of the peel force function. By including the kinetic energy of the tape in the Lagrangian, we derive equations of motion that support stick-slip jumps as a natural consequence of the inherent dynamics.

Our analysis also shows that mass of the ribbon has a strong influence {{on the nature of}} the dynamics. Comment: Accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. E (Rapid Communication...|$|E
40|$|We study {{experimentally}} {{the fracture}} dynamics during the peeling {{at a constant}} velocity of a roller adhesive <b>tape</b> <b>mounted</b> on a freely rotating pulley. Thanks to a high speed camera, we measure, in an intermediate range of peeling velocities, high frequency oscillations between phases of slow and rapid propagation of the peeling fracture. This so-called stick-slip regime is well known as the consequence of a decreasing fracture energy of the adhesive in a certain range of peeling velocity coupled to the elasticity of the peeled tape. Simultaneously with stick-slip, we observe low frequency oscillations of the adhesive roller angular velocity which are the consequence of a pendular instability of the roller submitted to the peeling force. The stick-slip dynamics is shown to become intermittent due to these slow pendular oscillations which produce a quasi-static oscillation of the peeling angle while keeping constant the peeling fracture velocity (averaged over each stick-slip cycle). The observed correlation between the mean peeling angle and the stick-slip amplitude questions {{the validity of the}} usually admitted independence with the peeling angle of the fracture energy of adhesives.

30|$|Several studies [76, 77, 97, 98] have {{reported}} on mounting tissues using adhesive tape, particularly {{in cases where}} {{it is difficult to}} fix the sample plate in a thaw-mounted manner in MALDI MSI due to size. Attaching fragile tissues using adhesive tape [76] and the CryoJane Tape-Transfer System® [77] can aid in preparing animal samples as well as tissue sections of plant samples. Lee’s group is actively conducting metabolite studies with MALDI-MS of maize seed section [97] and lipid mapping in a single cell of zebrafish embryo [98] by utilizing CryoJane tape in sample preparation. However, Kim et al. [85] recently reported on ToF–SIMS imaging results using adhesive tape. They compared ToF–SIMS images of corn seed tissues acquired using thaw-mounted preparation and 3  M <b>tape</b> <b>mounted</b> method. Unlike the thaw-mounted method, MSI results with undistorted location information of fatty acids and phospholipids present in the corn seed tissue were acquired when the corn seed tissue was mounted using adhesive tape. This was achieved without contamination of the embedding substance gelatin. A follow-up study by Lee’s group [83] described the polymer material in the adhesive tape as acting like insulation between the sample plate and the tissue sample, preventing direct thermal energy from being applied to the sample. These results show that ToF–SIMS imaging of hard plant tissue samples is possible without image distortion and with reduced adhesion properties when the appropriate sample preparation procedure is utilized.|$|E
40|$|A {{very simple}} {{experiment}} was fielded on LDEF {{to measure the}} energetic radiation dose by means of passive dosimetry. It consisted of two identical packets of 16 LiF thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) arranged in planar arrays. One array {{was placed on the}} leading edge of the spacecraft, the other on the trailing edge. These arrays were installed in opaque packets of 1 mil Al foil and Kapton <b>tape</b> <b>mounted</b> behind an Al plate of 30 mils thickness. The nominal energy thresholds were 14 MeV for protons and 650 keV for electrons. In addition to the flight arrays, two control arrays were prepared which were kept with the flight arrays as long as possible during experimental integration and then stored in the lab. The flight and control arrays were read out alternating in groups of four; it was found that the control dose was negligible. The flight and control detectors were exposed to a 55 MeV proton beam in order to provide a recalibration of the detectors. It was found that the post-flight and pre-flight calibrations were in good agreement. A comparison of results with the prediction shows that the measured dose was a factor of 4 to 5 low. It is possible that there was in-flight annealing of the TLDs as a result of the long mission and perhaps temperature excursions of the sensors. The East-West effect was larger than expected. The ratio of 1. 65 is approximately what was expected for the protons alone. Electrons should reduce the dose ratio since electrons add equally to the leading and trailing edge dose. A possible explanation is that the electron dose was negligible compared to the proton dose...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Deduplication is a commonly-used {{technique}} on disk-based storage pools. However, deduplication has {{not been}} used for tape-based pools: tape characteristics, such as high mount and seek times combined with data fragmentation re-sulting from deduplication create a toxic combination that leads to unacceptably high retrieval times. This work proposes DedupT, a system that efficiently supports deduplication on tape pools. This paper (i) details the main challenges to enable efficient deduplication on tape libraries, (ii) presents a class of solutions based on graph-modeling of similarity between data items that enables efficient placement on tapes; and (iii) presents the design and evaluation of novel cross-tape and on-tape chunk placement algorithms that alleviate <b>tape</b> <b>mount</b> time overhead and reduce on-tape data fragmentation. Using 4. 5 TB of real-world workloads, we show that DedupT retains at least 95 % of the deduplication efficiency. We show that DedupT mitigates major retrieval time overheads, and, due to reading less data, is able to offer better restore performance compared {{to the case of}} restoring non-deduplicated data. ...|$|R
