5|$|At some {{distance}} {{back from the}} leading edge, the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions to a <b>turbulent</b> flow. From a drag standpoint, it is advisable to have the transition from laminar to <b>turbulent</b> flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have {{a large amount of}} the wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the <b>turbulent</b> layer.|$|E

5|$|It {{consists}} of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at the depth of intended decompression stops by buoys.

5|$|The viscous {{nature of}} airflow reduces the local {{velocities}} on a surface and {{is responsible for}} skin friction. The layer of air over the wing's surface that is slowed down or stopped by viscosity, is the boundary layer.

25|$|TIMP3 also {{decreases}} {{the expression of}} TNFα (a pro-inflammatory regulator) during <b>turbulent</b> flow. Activity of TNFα in <b>turbulent</b> flow {{was measured by the}} expression of TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE) in blood. TNFα decreased if miR-712 was inhibited or TIMP3 overexpressed, suggesting that miR-712 and TIMP3 regulate TACE activity in <b>turbulent</b> flow conditions.|$|E
25|$|When {{the ball}} is new the seam is {{used to create a}} layer of <b>turbulent</b> air {{on one side of the}} ball, by angling it to one side and {{spinning}} the ball along the seam. This changes the separation points of the air with the ball; this <b>turbulent</b> air creates a greater coverage of air, providing lift. The next layer of air will have a greater velocity over the side with the <b>turbulent</b> air due to the greater air coverage and as there is a difference in air velocity, the static pressure of both sides of the ball are different and {{the ball is}} both 'lifted' and 'sucked' towards the <b>turbulent</b> airflow side of the ball.|$|E
25|$|The {{numerical}} {{solution of the}} Navier–Stokes equations for <b>turbulent</b> flow is extremely difficult, and due to the significantly different mixing-length scales {{that are involved in}} <b>turbulent</b> flow, the stable solution of this requires such a fine mesh resolution that the computational time becomes significantly infeasible for calculation or direct numerical simulation. Attempts to solve <b>turbulent</b> flow using a laminar solver typically result in a time-unsteady solution, which fails to converge appropriately. To counter this, time-averaged equations such as the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS), supplemented with turbulence models, are used in practical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications when modeling <b>turbulent</b> flows. Some models include the Spalart–Allmaras, –, –, and SST models, which add a variety of additional equations to bring closure to the RANS equations. Large eddy simulation (LES) {{can also be used to}} solve these equations numerically. This approach is computationally more expensive—in time and in computer memory—than RANS, but produces better results because it explicitly resolves the larger <b>turbulent</b> scales.|$|E
25|$|If the gas or {{liquid is}} very viscous (resulting in <b>turbulent</b> {{differential}} motion), {{the reversal of}} the magnetic field may not be very periodic. This {{is the case with}} the Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by <b>turbulent</b> currents in a viscous outer core.|$|E
25|$|The {{particle}} Reynolds {{number is}} important in determining the fall velocity of a particle. When the particle Reynolds number indicates laminar flow, Stokes' law {{can be used to}} calculate its fall velocity. When the particle Reynolds number indicates <b>turbulent</b> flow, a <b>turbulent</b> drag law must be constructed to model the appropriate settling velocity.|$|E
25|$|The Rouse profile characterizes {{sediment}} concentrations {{because the}} Rouse number includes both <b>turbulent</b> mixing and settling {{under the weight}} of the particles. <b>Turbulent</b> mixing results in the net motion of particles from regions of high concentrations to low concentrations. Because particles settle downward, for all cases where the particles are not neutrally buoyant or sufficiently light that this settling velocity is negligible, there is a net negative concentration gradient as one goes upward in the flow. The Rouse Profile therefore gives the concentration profile that provides a balance between <b>turbulent</b> mixing (net upwards) of sediment and the downwards settling velocity of each particle.|$|E

25|$|Turbulence {{models can}} be {{classified}} based on computational expense, which corresponds to the range of scales that are modeled versus resolved (the more <b>turbulent</b> scales that are resolved, the finer {{the resolution of the}} simulation, and therefore the higher the computational cost).

25|$|Using the {{definition}} of the Reynolds number we can see that a large diameter with rapid flow, where the density of the blood is high, tends towards turbulence. Rapid changes in vessel diameter may lead to <b>turbulent</b> flow, for instance when a narrower vessel widens to a larger one. Furthermore, a bulge of atheroma may be the cause of <b>turbulent</b> flow, where audible turbulence may be detected with a stethoscope.|$|E
