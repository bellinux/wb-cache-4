40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effect of {{childbirth}} delivery method on vaginal pressure and abdominal thickness during the Valsalva maneuver (VAL). [Subjects] Thirty healthy female volunteers (26 – 39 years of age) were selected for this research. Their delivery histories were: nulliparous 10, vaginal delivery 10, and Cesarean delivery 10. None of the participants had a history of incontinence. [Methods] In the crook-lying position, a perineometer probe was inserted into the vagina and the transducer was placed transversely on the right side of the body during the Valsalva maneuver. [Results] There were significant differences in the thickness of the transverses abdominis (TrA) between in all <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> rest <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Valsalva maneuver, and there were significant differences in the internus oblique (IO) in <b>the</b> nulliparous <b>group.</b> During <b>the</b> Valsalva maneuver, there were sig-nificant differences in the TrA between <b>the</b> nulliparous <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> vaginal delivery <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> there were sig-nificant differences in the IO between <b>the</b> nulliparous delivery <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> vaginal delivery <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> between <b>the</b> nulliparous <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cesarean section <b>group.</b> Delivery history changed vaginal pressure, and there were significant differences between <b>the</b> nulliparous <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> vaginal delivery <b>group,</b> <b>and</b> between <b>the</b> nulliparous <b>group</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cesarean delivery <b>group.</b> [Conclusion] Pregnancy <b>and</b> delivery method may affect pelvic floor and abdominal muscles during the Valsalva maneuver...|$|R
