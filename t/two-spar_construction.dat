50|$|The Avro Manchester was {{designed}} with great consideration {{for ease of}} manufacture and repair. The fuselage of the aircraft comprised longitudinal stringers or longerons throughout, over which an external skin of aluminium alloy was flush-riveted for a smooth external surface. The wings were of a <b>two-spar</b> <b>construction,</b> the internal ribs being made of aluminium alloys; fuel was contained with several self-sealing fuel tanks within the wings. The tail shared a similar construction to the wing, featuring a twin fin-and-rudder configuration that provided good vision for the dorsal gunner.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} was a pusher biplane with a square section nacelle mounted between {{the upper and}} lower wings, which were of <b>two-spar</b> <b>construction,</b> the spars being ash I-sections. To maintain the leading edge section there were half-ribs between each rib, these extending from the leading edge to the main spar. A single horizontal tailplane with a split elevator and a rudder divided into two part, half above and half below the tailplane, were carried on ash booms behind the wing, the booms being connected by hollow wooden vertical struts and tubular steel horizontal members. The booms were spindled to an I-section except at the points of attachment of the cross-members. [...] The upper wing was double the span of the lower and had wide-span ailerons occupying the whole trailing edge outboard of the tail booms. The wings were connected by a single pair of struts on either side, the outer section of the upper wing being braced by wires leading to inverted-V kingposts. The wide-track undercarriage consisted of a pair of long laminated wood skids each bearing pair of wheels on a short axle. No tailskid was fitted.|$|E
50|$|PZL.16 was a high-wing braced monoplane, {{conventional}} in layout, of all-metal construction. It had a steel framed, canvas covered fuselage (engine part {{covered with}} duralumin). The elliptical wing was <b>two-spar,</b> of duralumin <b>construction,</b> canvas-covered, fitted with slats and flaps. The tail {{was made of}} duralumin. It had a conventional fixed landing gear with a rear wheel, main gear had teardrop covers. The closed cabin had a capacity of five: a pilot in front and 4 passengers in two rows, with doors on the left.|$|R
25|$|PZL Ł.2 was a high-wing braced {{parasol wing}} monoplane, {{conventional}} in layout, of all-metal construction. It had a duralumin framed, canvas covered fuselage (engine part {{was covered with}} duralumin). Crew of two was sitting in tandem in open cockpits, with twin controls. The observer had a 7.7mm Lewis machine gun on a ring mounting. The elliptical wing was <b>two-spar,</b> of duralumin <b>construction,</b> canvas-covered, fitted with slats, flaps and flaperons. Wings could be dismounted for transport. The tail was of duralumin construction, canvas covered. It had a conventional fixed landing gear with a rear skid.|$|R
50|$|Mixed {{construction}} low-wing cantilever monoplane, two-engine, conventional in layout. A fuselage was {{square in}} cross-section, {{made of a}} steel frame, canvas-covered (duralumin-covered in front). Wings of wooden <b>construction,</b> <b>two-spar,</b> plywood-covered. Twin strutted tail. Crew of five: in a glazed nose a bombardier-gunner, then two pilots, sitting {{side by side in}} an open cockpit. In mid-fuselage a radio operator and an upper gunner. Two Short metal floats. Four-blade wooden propellers, later three-blade metal ones. Two fuel tanks 1680 l in wings. Armament: four 7.9 mm Vickers F machine guns on ring mountings in fuselage nose and in a dorsal position. According to some sources, also one underbelly machine gun. Bomb load: up to 1,000 kg (other sources - 600 kg) or 750 kg torpedo.|$|R
50|$|Mixed {{construction}} (steel and wood) braced high-wing (parasol) monoplane, conventional in layout. A fuselage of a steel frame, canvas-covered (engine {{part was}} duralumin-covered). Rectangular wings with elliptical ends, <b>two-spar,</b> of wooden <b>construction,</b> canvas and plywood covered. Wings could be dismounted. Crew of two, sitting in tandem in open cockpits, with twin controls. Conventional fixed landing gear, with a rear skid. The observer had a 7.7 mm machine gun on a ring mounting. A 9-cylinder air-cooled radial engine Wright Whirlwind J-5Ab (produced in Poland by Polish Skoda Works) with 162 kW (220 hp) nominal power and 176 kW (240 hp) take-off power. Two-blade wooden or metal propeller, 2.7 m diameter. Fuel tank 250 liters in the fuselage, could be dropped {{in case of}} fire emergency (normal fuel capacity was 200 l).|$|R
50|$|Mixed {{construction}} low-wing cantilever monoplane, conventional in layout, with a fixed {{landing gear}} and a closed cockpit. Steel framed fuselage, covered with canvas {{on a wooden}} frame, aluminum in front engine section. Three-part trapezoid wings with rounded tips, of wooden <b>construction,</b> <b>two-spar,</b> plywood (in front) and canvas covered, fitted with split flaps and slats. Conventional cantilever empennage, plywood (fins) and canvas (elevators and rudder) covered. Two seats in tandem, under a canopy, with a fixed panoramic windshield and small side windows. Behind the cockpit was a place for a baggage. Conventional fixed landing gear with a rear wheel, the main gear was in covers. 4-cylinder straight engine de Havilland Gipsy Major in front, driving a two-blade tractor wooden propeller Szomański of a fixed pitch. Fuel tanks 180 l in mid-wing section. Cruise fuel consumption 28 l/h.|$|R
