5|$|It was in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> Abu Taghlib {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in 964, {{when his father}} had once again been embroiled in a conflict with the Buyids. The army of the Buyid Mu'izz al-Dawla occupied Mosul and Nasir al-Dawla was once again forced to flee to the hill country of the northern Jazira. Abu Taghlib led the resistance against the Buyids, who, unable to maintain themselves there, evacuated Mosul and reached a new agreement with the Hamdanids. Consequently, Nasir al-Dawla was now increasingly eclipsed by his sons, and was deposed outright and exiled in 967, dying in captivity shortly after.|$|E
5|$|For the Muslim sepoys in the 5th Light Infantry, {{interaction}} with Kasim Mansur, {{who was an}} Indian Muslim merchant in Singapore, served to fuel this sense of divided loyalties further. Kasim Mansur together with a local imam, Nur Alam Shah, would often host members of the 5th Light Infantry at Mansur’s home {{and it was then}} that the duo persuaded the Muslim sepoys to adhere to the fatwa issued by the Ottoman Sultan and to turn their guns against their British commanding officers and contribute towards the war against these kafirs who were battling their Muslim brothers who were defending the Caliphate in the West. It was within <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> the plan was hatched for the mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Paja Jovanović (1859–1957) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} Serbian realist painters of the late 19th century. During his early career, he came to be identified with Orientalist painting, depicting scenes from the Balkans, which were then under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Between 1877 and 1882, he attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, where he came under the mentorship of painting instructors Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller. Griepenkerl taught the young Jovanović the underlying structural principles of Renaissance and Baroque art, thus helping him better understand spatial problems and the arrangement of large numbers of figures, both moving and static. Müller encouraged Jovanović to take a naturalist approach to painting, recording only what he could see and relying as little as possible on his imagination. It was in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> Müller instructed Jovanović to make direct studies of Balkan life during his visits home, purposely steering him towards Orientalist painting.|$|E

5|$|While Marguerite Louise's {{behaviour}} was tolerated by {{the previous}} Abbess of Montmartre, the new Abbess, Madame d'Harcourt, frequently complained about her to the Grand Duke and the King. In retaliation, Marguerite Louise threatened to kill the Abbess with a hatchet and a pistol, and formed a clique against her. It was in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> Cosimo III consented, in line with her wishes, to Marguerite Louise's departure for a new convent, at Saint-Mandé on the Eastern outskirts of Paris, on the condition she go out only with the King Louis XIV's explicit permission and be attended by a chamberlain of his choice. Since she would not agree, her pension was suspended, only to be resumed when Louis XIV compelled her to yield.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} surviving mathematical treatises of ancient China is the Book on Numbers and Computation (Suan shu shu), part of the Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts dated 202 to 186 BCE and found in Jiangling County, Hubei. Another mathematical text compiled during the Han was The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven (Zhoubi Suanjing), dated no earlier than the 1st century BCE (from perhaps multiple authors) and contained materials similar to those described by Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, yet the zhoubi school of mathematics was not explicitly mentioned until Cai Yong's (132–192 CE) commentary of 180 CE. A preface {{was added to the}} text by Zhao Shuang 趙爽 in the 3rd century CE. There was also the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu); its full title was found on two bronze standard measurers dated 179 CE (with speculation that its material existed in earlier books under different titles) and was provided with detailed commentary by Liu Hui (fl. 3rd century CE) in 263 CE. It is worth noting in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> many of the documents excavated from Qin and Han sites contain evidence of the practical mathematics used by administrators for inventories and taxes, as well as for calculating labor needed for public works projects, just as described in the mathematical treatises.|$|E
25|$|It was in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> {{the magistrates}} reacted to Ann Hutchinson's claim of {{receiving}} divine, authoritative revelations.|$|E
50|$|The {{drawback}} to the FUD tactic in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> is <b>that,</b> when the stated or implied threats fail to materialize over time, the customer or decision-maker frequently reacts by withdrawing budgeting or support from future security initiatives.|$|R
2500|$|Ratzinger did not {{directly}} say whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions, but did say in <b>this</b> same <b>context</b> <b>that</b> [...] "It {{would be foolish to}} construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views." ...|$|R

25|$|Lanna embraced {{and adopted}} the Indianized Buddhist culture of Haripunjaya, {{continuing}} {{the tradition of}} scholarship and spreading the Theravada religion to the Tai peoples. It was in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> Bodhiramsi wrote the Camadevivamsa.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{prospect}} of a conflict with the house of Austria offended a great part of the Catholics of France, notably the court. Marie de Médicis and the duke D' Épernon were notable members of this party. It was in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> Henry was assassinated by a fanatic, Ravaillac, which put a stop to his project.|$|E
25|$|The Secular Franciscan charism is {{not given}} to an {{individual}} person but {{to a group of}} brothers and sisters. As times change, it has to adapt to the needs and expectations of the Holy Church. Thus from the outset, it is a group that is shaped by the Holy Church, and it is only in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> the charism can thrive.|$|E

30|$|Secondly, a point I {{would like}} to raise in <b>this</b> <b>context,</b> is <b>that</b> the focus on {{practical}} purpose reduces the term technoscience to just another term for engineering and shifts the discussion towards the nexus of science, theory and engineering.|$|R
5000|$|Reverse {{engineering}} in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> means, <b>that</b> the UML tool reads program source code as input and derives model data and corresponding graphical UML diagrams from it (as {{opposed to the}} somewhat broader meaning described in the article [...] "Reverse engineering").|$|R
25|$|It was in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> the 1987 America's Cup {{was seen}} as the best {{opportunity}} yet for a successful challenge, as the event was now outside the control of the NYYC and held in a location with strong but variable breezes, unlike the predictable and placid winds off Rhode Island. The regatta therefore attracted enormous additional interest over previous series.|$|E
25|$|Closely {{related to}} this, {{is the idea}} that art has The spiritual {{dimension}} and can transcend 'every-day' experience, reaching a spiritual plane. The Theosophical Society popularized the ancient wisdom of the sacred books of India and China {{in the early years of}} the century. It was in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> Piet Mondrian, Wassily Kandinsky, Hilma af Klint and other artists working towards an 'objectless state' became interested in the occult as a way of creating an 'inner' object.|$|E
25|$|It was in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> {{the young}} heir found himself nurtured in London, {{where he was}} to lead a miserable existence. He {{appears to have been}} sickly, as shown by the {{accounts}} kept between 1588 and 1598 of payments for medicines, ointments, pills and syrups administered to him. In 1593, he wrote in pathetic terms to the queen's secretary, Sir Robert Cecil, but the government really only had one use for him.|$|E

25|$|Eta-conversion {{expresses the}} idea of extensionality, which in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> is <b>that</b> two {{functions}} are the same {{if and only if}} they give the same result for all arguments. Eta-conversion converts between λx.(f x) and f whenever x does not appear free in f.|$|R
50|$|UML statecharts also {{introduce}} the complementary AND-decomposition. Such decomposition {{means that a}} composite state can contain two or more orthogonal regions (orthogonal means compatible and independent in <b>this</b> <b>context)</b> and <b>that</b> being in such a composite state entails being in all its orthogonal regions simultaneously.|$|R
25|$|In 1160, {{the first}} King of Portugal Afonso Henriques conferred the first Portuguese Foral charter, later re-confirmed and {{validated}} on 6 April 1198, by his successor King Sancho I, {{and again in}} April 1219, by King Afonso II. The village progressively imposed its importance in the territory it belonged, which included diverse resources, a prolifieration of small agglomerations and agricultural parcels. It was in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> in 1277, King Afonso III issued a charter to allow a fair in Ansiães.|$|E
25|$|The {{raising of}} CPMF can only meet the regular and {{increasing}} demand of the states. It {{was decided to}} augment {{the strengths of the}} state governments. It is in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> I.R. Battalions were raised in Assam {{with the assistance of the}} central government. The central government however reserves the first right to call on these battalions as and when required for deployment outside the state. The personnel of the battalion are engaged in both operational as well as law and order duties.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2011, the {{financial}} markets, fearing {{the collapse of the}} euro zone associated with the European sovereign debt crisis, were severely shaken. European and French bank shares recorded substantial falls. It was within <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> Britain's Mail on Sunday (Daily Mail) published, on Sunday August 7, an article in which it announced Société Générale's imminent bankruptcy. The newspaper quickly published a retraction and its apologies but, despite that, the rumour gathered pace, notably on social networks, resulting in a spectacular fall in Société Générale's share price and in bearish speculation.|$|E
5000|$|... "Consideration" [...] in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> means <b>that</b> {{a promise}} {{is given in}} return for a promise received. The usage of the word derives from {{expressions}} such as: [...] "I will give you ten pounds in consideration of the apples you are delivering to me." ...|$|R
50|$|Stability in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> means <b>that</b> {{a matrix}} norm {{of the matrix}} used in the {{iteration}} is at most unity, called (practical) Lax-Richtmyer stability. Often a von Neumann stability analysis is substituted for convenience, although von Neumann stability only implies Lax-Richtmyer stability in certain cases.|$|R

25|$|The Book of Malachi {{was written}} {{to correct the}} lax {{religious}} and social behaviour of the Israelites – particularly the priests – in post-exilic Jerusalem. Although the prophets urged the people of Judah and Israel to see their exile as punishment for failing to uphold their covenant with Elohim, {{it was not long}} after they had been restored to the land and to Temple worship that the people's commitment to their God began, once again, to wane. It was in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> the prophet commonly referred to as Malachi delivered his prophecy.|$|E
25|$|By {{the turn}} of the eighteenth century, many of these {{traditional}} dances began to be performed, or referred to thematically, by a blossoming theatrical trade. Peasant or Serf Theaters entertained the subjugated native peoples of present-day Ukraine, who remained relegated to lower social classes in their own homelands, while their foreign rulers often lived lavishly in comparison, importing foreign entertainers and their dances. It is within <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> staged Ukrainian folk dances, which depicted the ideals of an agrarian society, gained even more popularity with the native population, which further developed the theater into a thriving occupation.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{challenge to the}} department and its detectives during Seedman's tenure as chief was the Black Liberation Army (BLA). An offshoot of the Black Panthers who espoused a more militant and radical philosophy, they staged deadly ambushes on police officers in cities across the country. In New York their three attacks left four officers dead and two seriously wounded; in one, no suspects have ever been identified. After one of the attacks the BLA claimed responsibility, saying it was avenging the deaths of 19 prisoners in the Attica prison riots the previous year. It was in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> <b>that</b> the incident that ended Seedman's police career occurred.|$|E
50|$|Gerard K. O'Neill {{proposed}} {{the use of}} storage rings as building blocks for a collider in 1956. A key benefit of storage rings in <b>this</b> <b>context</b> is <b>that</b> the storage ring can accumulate a high beam flux from an injection accelerator that achieves a much lower flux.|$|R
