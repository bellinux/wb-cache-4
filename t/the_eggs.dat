5|$|After Marge leaves Bart with Nelson, Bart discovers two {{eggs in a}} bird's nest. Since he {{does not}} want the babies to die like their mother, he decides to hatch <b>the</b> <b>eggs,</b> and {{secretly}} keeps <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> warm in his treehouse. After Bart spends more time in his treehouse, Marge starts to suspect he is up to something. After Marge finds out what Bart has been doing, she tells him she is proud of him. With Marge's help, <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> eventually hatch, but the Simpson family is shocked when instead of birds, a pair of lizards emerge from <b>the</b> <b>eggs,</b> whom Bart names Chirpy Boy and Bart Jr.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The mother will {{pay close attention to}} the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though {{studies have shown that the}} mother does not pay attention to <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> persists for days after they are removed; when <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> were replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E
5|$|Females lay {{from ten}} to three hundred eggs at a time, {{depending}} on species, fertilising {{them with the}} stored sperm as they do so. Many species deposit <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> on moist soil or organic detritus, but some construct nests lined with dried faeces, and may protect <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> within silk cocoons. In most species, the female abandons <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> after they are laid, but some species in the orders Platydesmida and Stemmiulida provide parental care for eggs and young.|$|E
50|$|Gangows are polar bear-like enemies {{that will}} attack both the player and <b>the</b> <b>egg.</b> If they back <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> {{into a corner}} or land on <b>the</b> <b>egg,</b> it will break.

50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to {{successfully}} push and drop an <b>egg</b> down to <b>the</b> bottom of a vertically scrolling cavern of ice. The player is able to push <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> left and right, push it off cliffs onto lower platforms, and melt ice blocks to create a passage for <b>the</b> <b>egg.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> falls more than 3 blocks downward, it will break.

5|$|In 1994, Mikhailov {{suggested}} that Macroolithus represented <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> {{of a large}} theropod, specifically Tarbosaurus, based on the large size of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> and the largely overlapping distribution. However, the discovery of an oviraptorid embryo inside an elongatoolithid egg cast doubt on this hypothesis. With the discovery of multiple oviraptorosaur-elongatoolithid associations in the late 1990s, <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> of elongatoolithids came to be accepted as belonging to oviraptorosaurian dinosaurs. Oviraptorid parentage was confirmed for Macroolithus when, in 2008, oviraptorid embryos resembling Heyuannia were discovered inside a pair of M. yaotunensis eggs in Jiangxi.|$|E
5|$|Like most cichlids, such as Oreochromis mossambicus, convicts brood (exhibit {{parental care}} of) both eggs and free-swimming fry. <b>The</b> <b>eggs</b> hatch {{approximately}} 72 hours after fertilization. Until {{that time the}} parents expel intruders and potential egg predators from around the nest. They also fan <b>the</b> <b>eggs,</b> moving water with their fins over the clutch to provide oxygenation. They fan <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> both day and night; at night they use their sense of smell to recognize the presence of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> in the dark, and they keep their pelvic fins in contact with <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> to remain at the right distance for fanning. In darkness the pair recognizes each other and detect predators using their sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata in Queensland {{prefers to}} lay eggs on dead, brown leaves about 20millimetres long, {{suspended}} {{near the top}} of its capture web, and then cover <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> with a sheet of silk. If there is no dead leaf available, the female will make a small horizontal silk platform in the capture web, lay <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> on it, and then cover <b>the</b> <b>eggs.</b> In Northern Territory, P. fimbriata occasionally lays eggs in a dead leaf, but more usually in a silk egg sac on a small horizontal web suspended on the main web.|$|E
40|$|During {{the first}} three {{cleavage}} divisions of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> nuclei a precise sequence of spindle orientation and elongation parallel to the longitudinal axis of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> is apparently involved in positioning one nucleus among the polar granules at the posterior pole of <b>the</b> <b>egg.</b> <b>The</b> size of this nucleus, and the position at which <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> cleaves when pole cell formation occurs, appear to constitute part of the mechanism which ensures that only one nucleus {{is included in the}} first pole cell. Blastoderm formation occurs without a well-defined migration of nuclei to <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> surface. Nuclei are so large in relation to the size of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> that uniform spacing and distribution of nuclei ensures that a large proportion are situated near <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> surface. Those nuclei which are near <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> surface divide synchronously to form a layer of blastoderm nuclei, while mem-branous cleavage furrows invaginate from <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> surface between them. Nuclei in the central region of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> chamber condense to form yolk nuclei before blastoderm nuclei have been separated from the rest of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> by <b>the</b> completion of the cleavage membranes. Polar granules provide the only evidence of fine-structural differences in different regions of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> chamber cytoplasm. They are found near the posterior pole of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> from an early stage of oogenesis. They undergo a specific sequence of structural changes and increase in size as <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> grows.

25|$|The larva inside <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> becomes fully {{developed}} in about {{one month after}} being laid and then enters diapause to overwinter. <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> is in <b>the</b> overwintering stage lasting for eight or nine months.

40|$|AbstractDrosophila melanogaster mature oocytes in ovaries {{are arrested}} at {{metaphase}} I of meiosis. Eggs that {{have reached the}} uterus have released this arrest. It was not known where in the female reproductive tract egg activation occurs and what triggers it. We investigated when and where <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> is activated in Drosophila in vivo and at what meiotic stage <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> is fertilized. We found that changes in <b>the</b> <b>egg's</b> envelope's permeability, one feature of activation, initiate during ovulation, even while most of <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> is still within <b>the</b> ovary. <b>The</b> <b>egg</b> becomes impermeable as it proceeds down the oviducts; the process is complete by <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> is in <b>the</b> uterus. Cross-linking of vitelline membrane protein sV 23 also increases progressively as <b>the</b> <b>egg</b> moves through <b>the</b> oviducts and the uterus.

5|$|A {{recent study}} shows that both food {{availability}} and temperature affect the parental incubation of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> in northern mockingbirds.

5|$|Egg-laying {{takes two}} {{different}} forms {{depending on the}} species. The female in some families has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant {{on or near the}} water, so she can push her eggs inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping {{the surface of the water}} repeatedly with her abdomen, by shaking <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> on vegetation.

5|$|Gobioolithus {{eggs were}} {{probably}} laid in open nests {{on the banks}} of ephemeral rivers or lakes, which could frequently flood the nesting areas and bury <b>the</b> <b>eggs.</b> The distribution of <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> suggests that they had a long-term colonial nesting site at the Khermeen Tsav locality in the Barun Goyot Formation. At the Bayn-Dzak locality, <b>the</b> <b>eggs</b> are typically arranged in clutches, whereas elsewhere they are scattered randomly, each oriented nearly vertically in the substrate. The solitary eggs may have been laid and buried individually, similar to the nesting habits of modern megapodes. It is also possible that they were originally laid in clutches, but flooding separated them and deposited them vertically as the water level dropped. Water damage would also explain why Gobioolithus shells are frequently heavily recrystallized.|$|E
