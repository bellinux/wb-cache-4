5|$|Reviews {{have shown}} <b>that</b> <b>water</b> {{fluoridation}} reduces cavities in children. A conclusion for the efficacy in adults {{is less clear}} with some reviews finding benefit and others not. Studies in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s showed <b>that</b> <b>water</b> fluoridation reduced childhood cavities by fifty to sixty percent, while studies in 1989 and 1990 showed lower reductions (40% and 18% respectively), likely due to increasing use of fluoride from other sources, notably toothpaste, and also the 'halo effect' of food and drink that is made in fluoridated areas and consumed in unfluoridated ones.|$|E
5|$|A 2000 UK {{systematic}} review (York) found <b>that</b> <b>water</b> fluoridation {{was associated with}} a decreased proportion of children with cavities of 15% and with a decrease in decayed, missing, and filled primary teeth (average decreases was 2.25teeth). The review found that the evidence was of moderate quality: few studies attempted to reduce observer bias, control for confounding factors, report variance measures, or use appropriate analysis. Although no major differences between natural and artificial fluoridation were apparent, the evidence was inadequate for a conclusion about any differences.|$|E
5|$|Dalton also {{believed}} atomic theory {{could explain why}} water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found <b>that</b> <b>water</b> absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen. Dalton hypothesized {{this was due to}} the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).|$|E

5|$|In 1946, {{there was}} serious {{flooding}} in Salford, {{caused by a}} bottleneck at {{a bend in the}} river at Strangeways, on the border with Manchester.

5|$|When {{repairs to}} Craven Sluices were {{necessary}} in 1684, {{the water was}} temporarily diverted into Scots Float Channel. This worked well, and a regulating penn was built, so <b>that</b> <b>water</b> could be routed to Craven Sluices or Scots Float. Knock Sluice was built below the Appledore Sluice in 1686, and land above it was reclaimed. In 1696, New Knock Sluice was built, close to Craven Sluices, and the sea was finally excluded from the Wittersham Levels.|$|E
5|$|A {{collaboration}} between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency {{has resulted in the}} construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating sea trout to pass up the river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create the ramp. The finer material ensures <b>that</b> <b>water</b> mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers to move up the river, and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.|$|E
5|$|Aerith makes several {{appearances}} in the CGI film , as Cloud's spiritual guide, urging him {{to move on with}} his life and to forgive himself for the tragedies that were beyond his control, telling him that she never blamed him for her death. During their spiritual reunion, Aerith speaks to Cloud in an open meadow laden with flowers, cheerfully and kindheartedly poking fun at how he needlessly burdens himself with the past. However, she also acknowledges his suffering and offers kind words of support. One of Aerith's interactions with Cloud comes when each member of the original game's party helps in Cloud's final attack against Bahamut SIN; she appears as the last party member to assist Cloud. She also appears in the final scene of the movie, along with Zack Fair, where she gives Cloud more words of encouragement before she and Zack walk into the light. Near the end of the film, it is discovered <b>that</b> <b>water</b> mixed with the Lifestream flows beneath the flowerbed in Aerith's church, which manifests itself as a cure for Geostigma.|$|E

40|$|Trihalomethanes (THMs) {{are formed}} in water the {{chlorine}} used in water-treatment plants react with organic matter. THMs are suspected carcinogens. The {{goal of this}} study is determination of the concentration of THMS in potable water after chlorination. The study included 60 samples of potable water from <b>water</b> facilities <b>that</b> draw <b>water</b> from accumulations and 70 samples of potable water from <b>water</b> facilities <b>that</b> draw <b>water</b> from boreholes and springs. Samples were analysed by GC-ECD method with headspace technique. The obtained results for individual THMs in samples of potable <b>water</b> <b>that</b> draw <b>water</b> from accumulations, range from 15 – 55 µg/l for chloroform; 12 – 27 µg/l for dichlorobromomethane; 2 - 6 µg/l for chlorodibromomethane and 3 – 13 µg/l for bromoform. The obtained results for individual THMs in samples of potable <b>water</b> <b>that</b> draw <b>water</b> from boreholes and springs range from 5 – 15 µg/l for chloroform; 1 - 5 µg/l for dichlorobromomethane; 1 - 3 µg/l for chlorodibromomethane and 1 - 5 µg/l for bromoform. According to the national Regulation for Water Safety (46 / 08), the content of chloroform in 7 of tested samples of potable <b>water</b> <b>that</b> draw <b>water</b> from accumulations exceeded the MRL value (30 µg/l). The concentration of THMs in potable <b>water</b> after chlorination <b>that</b> comes from <b>water</b> facilities as wells and springs show significant decreasing trend in comparison with concentration of THMs in potable <b>water</b> <b>that</b> comes from accumulations (p< 0. 05).

5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard <b>that</b> <b>water</b> flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
5|$|Because of the ship's high profile, {{there were}} {{concerns}} about her stability {{in bad weather}} as she had {{a significant amount of}} weight mounted high in the ship; notably her catapults, cranes and anti-aircraft guns. To increase her stability, two lateral tanks were fitted with a pressurized butterfly valve connecting them so <b>that</b> <b>water</b> could flow between the tanks to counter her rolling motion. On trials in 1933, the system was judged successful as it deadened the ship's roll by 37-65%. However, maintenance of the system proved to be problematic as the tanks were difficult to access.|$|E
5|$|Before the New Waddell Dam was constructed, {{two phases}} of a {{three-phase}} study {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effects}} of the dam on fisheries. Completed in 2005, the third phase of the study determined that the larger reservoir has less nutrient concentrations due to CAP water introduction and <b>that</b> <b>water</b> fluctuations have reduced fish cover, likely affecting food and spawning. Large mouth bass populations have also declined but striped bass have entered the lake, likely by eggs transferred through CAP water. Around the lake, Reclamation has taken steps to protect wildlife habitats, including those for bald eagles and Gila topminnows.|$|E

5|$|By 01:00, {{there was}} too much water in the hull for the pumps to handle. Water began to enter the forward {{generator}} compartments, which forced the crew to work by candlelight. Lützow was so low in the water by 01:30 <b>that</b> <b>water</b> began to flood the forward boiler room. By that point, almost all of the compartments in the forward part of the ship, up to the conning tower and below the main armored deck, were thoroughly flooded. Water had also entered the ship through shell holes in the forecastle above the armored deck; the majority of the upper portion of the ship forward of the forward-most barbette was flooded as well. The battlecruiser's crew attempted to patch the shell holes three times, but as the flooding worsened and the draft increased, water increasingly washed over the deck and inhibited progress on the repair work. The crew attempted to reverse direction and steam backwards, but this had to be abandoned when the bow became so submerged that the propellers were pulled partially out of the water; forward draft had increased to over 17meters.|$|E

5|$|During the floods, {{flow through}} the narrow Wallula Gap was {{restricted}} such <b>that</b> <b>water</b> pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis, which formed in the lowlands of the Columbia Plateau. Lake Lewis backflooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River valleys. This flooding lasted {{for a period of}} 4–7 days. In the relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters were thick with suspended materials eroded from the scablands above. Some of the suspended materials settled out, creating thick Touchet Formation layers, or rhythmites, which are found throughout these valleys. The larger clasts settled out first, followed by the finer ones. This resulted in layers with graded bedding, or bedding in which the larger particles are at the bottom and the smaller ones are at the top.|$|E
