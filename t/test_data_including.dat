Design of the system, which consists of four tuned-gimbal gyros, eight accelerometers, and four processors, is discussed, with emphasis on its compact configuration (13 by 13 by 14 in.), based on symmetry properties of an octahedron. A matrix operator for least-squares combination of data from an arbitrary number of two-degree-of-freedom gyros is derived, and general parity equations for error analysis are given. Self-contained detection and isolation of a two-axis gyro failure is considered; system failure probability, which depends on component failure rates and self-correction capacities, is analyzed. <b>Test</b> <b>data,</b> <b>including</b> typical parity equation responses during motion and simulated gyro and accelerometer failures, are also presented...|$|E

Each pedestrian is observed by two disjoint camera views and has an average of 4.8 images in each view. The database provides two kinds of bounding boxes, i.e., manually annotated bounding boxes and bounding boxes detected by DPM [25]. Since DPM {{is closer to the}} realistic setting, we evaluate the proposed DFBP on the bounding box detected by DMP. We separate the database into training data including 1367 pedestrians and <b>test</b> <b>data</b> <b>including</b> 100 pedestrians.

40|$|Most {{performance}} metrics {{for learning}} algorithms {{do not provide}} information about the misclassified instances. Knowing which instances are misclassified and understanding why they are misclassified could guide future algorithm develop-ment. In this paper, we analyze the classification of over 190, 000 instances from 64 data sets and create heuristics to analyze and predict an instance’s expected dif-ficulty to classify correctly (instance hardness). We find that 5 % of the instances are misclassified by all 9 considered learning algorithms and that 17 % are mis-classified by at least half. The principal contributor to misclassification is class overlap. We demonstrate the utility of instance hardness by using it to filter hard instances from the data sets which increases the classification accuracy on <b>test</b> <b>data</b> (<b>including</b> the hard instances). ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a very low}} bit rate speech coder based on HMM (Hidden Markov Model). The encoder carries out phoneme recognition, and transmits phoneme indexes, state durations and pitch information to the decoder. In the decoder, phoneme HMMs are concatenated according to the phoneme indexes, and a sequence of mel-cepstral coefficient vectors is generated from the concatenated HMM by using an ML-based speech parameter generation technique. Finally we obtain synthetic speech by exciting the MLSA (Mel Log Spectrum Approximation) filter, whose coefficients are given by mel-cepstral coefficients, according to the pitch information.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the biomechanical effects of sinuses in the skull on the facial impact response. Two models were built, where one had sinuses and the other had none. The models were verified using cadaver <b>test</b> <b>data,</b> <b>including</b> impacts to frontal bone, zygomatic bone, and maxillae. In the maxilla and zygoma impact, sinuses were found to have no significant effect on the global distribution of stress or stiffness of facial bones, and the influence was limited in local area. In forehead impact, the sinuses significantly affected the distribution of stress and strain in the skull due to its location in facial bones. The result shows that if the sinus is far away from the location of impact, its effect on the overall response of skull could be ignored. In addition, the distance between the region of interest and sinuses is another important parameter when studying the local effect of sinuses...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of a vehicle’s seat back in rear impact accidents can significantly affect occupant kinematics and resulting injury potential. The only current United States (U. S.) government regulation addressing seat back strength is outlined in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 207, Seating Systems [1]. The test method outlined in this regulation is only partially predictive of seat performance in dynamic and/or real world impacts. Many seats continue to demonstrate gross deformations or catastrophic failures with potentially injurious occupant kinematics under the impact conditions of the FMVSS 301 Fuel System Integrity testing [2]. The Quasistatic Seat Test (QST) methodology, which utilizes an Anthropometric Test Dummy (ATD) and applies the load to the seat back through the ATD’s lumbar spine, {{has been shown to}} be a predictor of seat deformation under dynamic loading [3]. Different seat designs tested utilizing the QST methodologies are presented. Additionally, sled tests conducted at impact levels consistent with FMVSS 301 severities are presented and analyzed regarding occupant containment and the degree of encroachment of the deforming seat back or front seat occupant into the rear occupant’s seating compartment.

40|$|The groupwise {{approach}} to non-rigid image registration, solving the dense correspondence problem, {{has recently been}} shown to be a useful tool in many applications, in- cluding medical imaging, automatic construction of statis- tical models of appearance and analysis of facial dynam- ics. Such an approach overcomes limitations of traditional pairwise methods but at a cost of having to search for the solution (optimal registration) in a space of much higher dimensionality which grows rapidly with the number of ex- amples (images) being registered. Techniques to overcome this dimensionality problem have not been addressed suffi- ciently in the groupwise registration literature. In this paper, we propose a novel, fast and reliable, fully unsupervised stochastic algorithm to search for optimal groupwise dense correspondence in large sets of unmarked images. The efficiency of our approach stems from novel di- mensionality reduction techniques specific to the problem of groupwise image registration and from comparative insen- sitivity of the adopted optimisation scheme (Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA)) to the high dimensionality of the search space. Additionally, our algo- rithm is formulated in way readily suited to implementation on graphics processing units (GPU). In evaluation of our method we show a high robust- ness and success rate, fast convergence on various types of <b>test</b> <b>data,</b> <b>including</b> facial images featuring large degrees of both inter- and intra-person variation, and show consid- erable improvement in terms of accuracy of solution and speed compared to traditional methods...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{instrumented}} sensor plugs {{were installed}} on the Mars Science Laboratory heat shield in December 2008 {{as part of the}} Mars Science Laboratory Entry, Descent, and Landing Instrumentation (MEDLI) project. These sensor plugs contain four in-depth thermocouples and one Hollow aErothermal Ablation and Temperature (HEAT) sensor. The HEAT sensor follows the time progression of a 700 C isotherm through the thickness of a thermal protection system (TPS) material. The data can be used to infer char depth and, when analyzed in conjunction with the thermocouple data, the thermal gradient through the TPS material can also be determined. However, the uncertainty on the isotherm value is not well defined. To address this uncertainty, a team at NASA Ames Research Center is carrying out a HEAT sensor calibration test program. The scope of this test program is described, and initial results from experiments conducted in the laboratory to study the isotherm temperature of the HEAT sensor are presented. Data from the laboratory tests indicate an isotherm temperature of 720 C 60 C.
