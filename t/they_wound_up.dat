5|$|The Briscoes {{have been}} {{involved}} with the promotion since its early days, debuting at PWG's fourth-ever show Are You Adequately Prepared to Rock? in October 2003, losing to Super Dragon and B-Boy. Due to the costs of bringing them in from the East coast and the sabbatical from the sport the brothers took, they would not appear again until May 20, 2006, at Enchantment Under the Sea, falling to Cape Fear (Quicksilver and El Generico). At the 2006 Battle of Los Angeles, the Briscoes' numerous no-shows were worked into the company's kayfabe when PWG announced days before that they had been pulled from the tournament as punishment. <b>They</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> appearing anyway, attacking Commissioner Dino Winwood on Night One. The next night, they wrestled in a three-way tag team match for the PWG World Tag Team Championship against Homicide and B-Boy and defending champions Arrogance (Chris Bosh and Scott Lost), who went on to retain the titles.|$|E

She is remembered by the humans as a Queen of Southmarch, but her Qar ancestry is forgotten.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers injury {{epidemic}} {{continued as}} Hanley Ramírez, after playing {{in just four}} games, injured his hamstring in the May 3 game against the San Francisco Giants at AT Park. Clayton Kershaw allowed only 3 hits and 1 run in 7 innings but the Giants won 2-1 on a walk-off home run by Buster Posey. The following day, Matt Magill got pounded in his second start, allowing 5 runs in only 1.1 innings. The Dodgers fell behind 6-1 but came back to tie the game, partially thanks to Dee Gordon who tripled, stole two bases and scored two runs. However, <b>they</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> losing 10-9 on a walk-off home run by Guillermo Quiróz in the 10th inning. The Giants completed the sweep of the injury-riddled Dodgers the next day, 4-3.|$|E

25|$|Bud Norris {{allowed only}} two runs in seven innings, out dueling Tampa Bay Rays starter Chris Archer in a 3–2 win at Dodger Stadium on July 26. A two-run homer by Evan Longoria {{was the key}} blow as the Rays, behind Matt Moore won the next game, 3–1. The Dodgers got into a wild game with the Diamondbacks on July 29, giving up seven runs {{in the top of}} the seventh inning and then {{answering}} back with five in the bottom of the inning, led by two-run homers by Joc Pederson and Chase Utley. <b>They</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> winning 9–7. The offense did not show up the next day and the Diamondbacks won 4–2. Despite losing starter Bud Norris to an injury two batters into the next game, the Dodgers, thanks to homers by Grandal, Seager and Pederson, beat the Diamondbacks 14–3 to end the month of July.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who were}} rescued first {{were taken to}} another {{building}} for treatment, as the ambulances were trapped inside the collapsed tower. The hospital {{did not have an}} emergency plan but nonetheless, surviving hospital workers and neighbors quickly improvised, under the management of the hospital, setting up aid stations and scavenging supplies. Rescue workers soon arrived to start digging through the rubble. A second quake made rescue work slower, because of fear of further collapse. Most bodies were identified by personal effects, some by dental records and some were so mangled that <b>they</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> being cremated without ever being identified, {{due to the lack of}} morgue facilities. 561 bodies were found and 188 were never identified. 266 were hospital workers and 44 were medical residents. The majority who were rescued were found in the first five days. The number of bodies recovered was high during those first days as well but the numbers dramatically increased between days 17 and 31.|$|E
25|$|Mauricio Soler came {{free from}} the peloton before the first climb {{of the day and}} took full points {{available}} to him, taking the lead outright in the King of the Mountains from Rasmussen. He and Carlos Sastre, for whom it was something of a surprise {{that he was able to}} get away from the peloton easily as he was 5th in the GC at the beginning of the day, worked together to stay away as long as possible. <b>They</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> being caught with 11 kilometers left to race by a group containing Rasmussen, Alberto Contador, Levi Leipheimer, and numerous domestiques from their teams. Rasmussen came clear of this group on the way up the Aubisque to win the stage. It was thought at the time that this all but cinched his victory in the Tour, since only flat stages and an individual time trial remained, and that even a relatively weak time trialist like Rasmussen was unlikely to lose three to five minutes.|$|E

2500|$|John Symon Asher [...] "Jack" [...] Bruce (14 May 1943 – 25 October 2014) was a Scottish musician, {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} known primarily for {{his contributions to}} the British supergroup Cream, which also included guitarist-singer Eric Clapton and drummer Ginger Baker. [...] In March 2011 Rolling Stone readers selected him as the eighth greatest bass guitarist of all time. [...] "Most musicians would have {{a very hard time}} distinguishing themselves if <b>they</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> in a band with Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker," [...] the magazine said at the time, [...] "but Jack Bruce was so gifted on the bass that he did it with ease." ...|$|E
2500|$|With plants facing {{imminent}} closings, Mann, with Mark Masaoka, and UAW Local 645 president Pete Beltran {{initiated a}} coalition between labor, {{the community and}} the Campaign to Keep GM Van Nuys Open, which Mann chaired for ten years. [...] Five thousand workers (50 percent Latino, 15 percent black, and 15 percent women) built the coalition in Black and Latino communities, where the members lived. Threatened with a boycott, GM kept the plant open for ten years. Reverend Frank Higgins, Sr. described the negotiation of the labor/community coalition with GM president F. James McDonald, “For the first time they have seen a coalition form in this nation that would make them come to the table. They didn’t come to bargain; they came to deal with us as though we were children. <b>They</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> leaving knowing they had a tiger by the tail!” ...|$|E
2500|$|Once {{a player}} signed with a team, be {{it from the}} AFL or NFL, there was tacit {{agreement}} between the leagues to honor each other's player contracts and not sign players who were under contract with a team in their rival league. [...] The unwritten agreement was broken [...] in May 1966 when the NFL's New York Giants signed Pete Gogolak, the first professional soccer-style placekicker, who had played out his option in 1965 with the AFL's Buffalo Bills. The NFL's breach of trust resulted in retaliation by the AFL: Oakland Raiders co-owner Al Davis took over as AFL Commissioner in April 1966, and he stepped up the bidding war after the Gogolak transfer, signing notable NFL players, including John Brodie Mike Ditka, and Roman Gabriel, to contracts with AFL teams, but after the merger agreement in June, <b>they</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> staying in the older league. Both leagues spent a combined $7 million signing their 1966 draft picks.|$|E
50|$|They were {{relegated to}} the new Third Division in 1924 and, when this was disbanded {{at the end of}} the 1925-26 season, they joined the Scottish Football Alliance. They {{remained}} in this league until 1928 when <b>they</b> were <b>wound</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Following Nazi Germany's {{attack against}} Poland in 1939, Rabbi Schneersohn {{refused to leave}} Warsaw. The {{government}} of the United States of America, which was still neutral, used its diplomatic relations to convince Nazi Germany to rescue Schneersohn from the war zone in German-occupied Poland. He remained in the city during the bombardments and its capitulation to Nazi Germany. He gave {{the full support of}} his organizations to assist as many Jews as possible to flee the invading armies. With the intercession of the United States Department of State in Washington, DC and with the lobbying of many Jewish leaders, such as Jacob Rutstein, on behalf of the Rebbe (and, reputedly, also with the help of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the head of the Abwehr), he was finally granted diplomatic immunity and given safe passage to go via Berlin to Riga, Latvia (where the Rebbe was a citizen and which was still free) and then on to New York City, where he arrived on 19 March 1940. Major Ernst Bloch, a decorated German army officer of Jewish descent, was put in command of a group which included Sgt. Klaus Schenk, a [...] "half-Jew" [...] and Pvt. Johannes Hamburger, a [...] "quarter-Jew" [...] assigned to locate the Rebbe in Poland and escort him safely to freedom. They were a few of up to 150,000 Jews and people of Jewish descent who were classified as Mischlinge ("mixed-breeds", i.e., Germans with one or two Jewish grandparents) by the Nazi government, but served in the German armed forces during World War II. <b>They</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> saving not only the Rebbe, but also over a dozen Hasidic Jews in the Rebbe's family or associated with him.|$|E
2500|$|Bob Pulford {{left the}} Kings after the 1976–77 season after {{constant}} feuding with then owner Jack Kent Cooke, and General Manager Jake Milford {{decided to leave}} as well. This led to struggles in the 1977–78 season, where the Kings finished below [...]500 and were easily swept {{out of the first}} round by the Maple Leafs. Afterwards Vachon would become a free agent and sign with the Detroit Red Wings. The following season, Kings coach Bob Berry tried juggling line combinations, and Dionne found himself on a new line with two young, mostly unknown players: second-year right winger Dave Taylor and left winger Charlie Simmer, who had been a career minor-leaguer. Each player benefited from each other, with Simmer being the gritty player who battled along the boards, Taylor being the play maker, and Dionne being the natural goal scorer. This line combination, known as the [...] "Triple Crown Line", would go on {{to become one of the}} highest-scoring line combinations in NHL history. During the first three seasons of the Triple Crown Line, a period where Dr. Jerry Buss purchased the Kings, the Lakers, and the Forum for $67.5million, the Kings were eliminated in the first round. Then in the 1982 Stanley Cup playoffs, a Kings team that finished 17th overall and fourth in their division with 63 points, managed to upset the second overall Edmonton Oilers, led by the young Wayne Gretzky. With two victories in Edmonton and one at the Forum – dubbed [...] "Miracle on Manchester", where the Kings managed to erase a 5–0 deficit at the third period and eventually win in overtime – the Kings managed to eliminate the vaunted Oilers, but <b>they</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> eliminated by eventual finalists Vancouver Canucks in five games.|$|E

50|$|At {{the death}} of his brother in 1322, Fernando Diaz {{inherited}} title over Orduña and Balmaseda.

50|$|They {{eventually}} {{ended up}} in the Western League, which was incorporated by the Scottish Football League as its new Third Division for the 1923-24 season.

60|$|The {{rain had}} soaked through their {{provision}} bags, but {{the bread and}} meat in the centre were dry; and of these they made a hearty meal and, laying the wetted food round the fire to dry, <b>they</b> <b>wound</b> <b>up</b> the repast with a long draught of wine.|$|E
60|$|They waited, and at last, {{thinking}} the coast clear, pulled the other craft from {{the bushes and}} tied it to the stern of their own boat.

60|$|I {{think you}} see The Times, and if so, {{you will have}} seen a very graceful and good account of the Birmingham readings.

25|$|In 1838, local {{government}} reform meant that Birmingham {{was one of}} the first new towns to be incorporated as a municipal borough by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.

The summer had already made impression upon that mass of uniform colour by tipping every twig with a tiny sprout of virescent yellow; while the minute sounds which issued from the forest revealed that the apparently still place was becoming a perfect reservoir of insect life.|$|E

But he had veiled his passion in words and phrases that, taken in themselves, had no meaning--that neither committed him nor claimed her.
