Bi-specific antibodies that target both the surface of T-cells and viral epitopes can prevent entry of the virus into somatic cells. Another group has utilised <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>technology</b> to develop a bi-specific antibody that neutralises viral particles by cross linking of envelope glycoproteins.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{versions}} of the Mellotron were manufactured by competitors {{in the early to}} mid-1970s. The Mattel Optigan was a toy keyboard designed {{to be used in the}} home, which played back sounds using optical discs. This was followed by the Vako Orchestron in 1975, which used a more professional-sounding version of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>technology.</b> It was popularised by Patrick Moraz.|$|E

5|$|The twin Voyager {{spacecraft}} {{were launched}} in 1977, each containing a 500 watt plutonium power source. Over 30 years later, each source is still producing about 300 watts which allows limited operation of each spacecraft. An {{earlier version of}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>technology</b> powered five Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Packages, starting with Apollo 12 in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the launch}} of the Dreamcast in Japan, Sega {{announced}} the release of its New Arcade Operation Machine Idea (NAOMI) arcade board, which served as a cheaper alternative to the Sega Model 3. NAOMI shared <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>technology</b> as the Dreamcast—albeit with twice as much system, video, and audio memory and an 160 Mbyte flash ROM board in place of a GD-ROM drive—allowing nearly identical home conversions of arcade games. Games were ported from NAOMI to the Dreamcast by several leading Japanese arcade companies, including Capcom (Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and Project Justice), Tecmo (Dead or Alive 2), Treasure (Ikaruga), and Sega itself (F355 Challenge and Crazy Taxi).|$|E
5|$|The Roland VK-7, {{introduced}} in 1997, attempted {{to emulate the}} sound of a Hammond using digital signal processing technology. An updated version, the VK-8, which appeared in 2002, also provided emulations of other vintage keyboards and provided a connector for a Leslie. Clavia introduced the Nord Electro in 2001; this used buttons to emulate the physical action of pulling or pushing a drawbar, with an LED graph indicating its current state. Clavia has released several updated versions of the Electro since then, and introduced the Nord Stage with <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>technology.</b> The Nord C2D was Clavia's first organ with real drawbars. Diversi, founded by former Hammond-Suzuki sales rep Tom Tuson in 2003, has specialised in Hammond clones, and featured a notable endorsement from Joey DeFrancesco.|$|E

30|$|No two {{refineries}} have <b>the</b> <b>same</b> configuration or apply <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>technologies</b> {{because of}} their feedstock and product requirements, processing characteristics, degree of integration, and how the plant has evolved. Enumerating units is easy to perform, but somewhat unwieldy and difficult when comparing plants. Complexity factors were introduced to quantify and simplify classification so that refineries could be compared relative to their sophistication and capital intensity.|$|R

5|$|The game {{is based}} on <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>technology</b> that powered Unreal, but the design of Unreal Tournament shifted the series' focus to {{competitive}} multiplayer action. Development took almost {{a year and a}} half, and the game was initially intended to be an expansion for Unreal. Unreal Tournament received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the graphics, artificial intelligence and gameplay, although the console ports were noted for having limitations. The game won a number of awards from a variety of gaming publications, and the series has continued with the releases of sequels Unreal Tournament 2003 in 2002, Unreal Tournament 2004 in 2004, and Unreal Tournament 3 in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey {{features}} a RoboCoaster G2 ride system provided by Dynamic Structures, KUKA and RoboCoaster. The first generation RoboCoaster system featured KUKA robotic arm technology anchored to a stationary platform, while the second-generation G2 system mounted the arms on a busbar track. The system was first publicly disclosed at the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show in 2003. At {{around the same}} time, rumors began circulating {{about the possibility of}} Islands of Adventure adding a Van Helsing-themed ride using this technology. These plans were later scrapped with Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ultimately using <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>technology</b> and opening on the same plot of land proposed for the Van Helsing ride. The ride's seats are mounted on robotic arms which are in turn mounted on a track. This allows the arms to travel through the attraction while performing their movements in synchronization with the ride's show elements (animated props, projection surfaces, etc.). This concept first appeared in the 2004 International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show. The disadvantage of this intricate machinery is that if the ride breaks down, some guests are stranded in uncomfortable positions, such as being tilted backwards in dark enclosed spaces.|$|E
5|$|Iron Man 2 is a 2010 American superhero film {{based on}} the Marvel Comics {{character}} Iron Man, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures.

Directed by Jon Favreau and written by Justin Theroux, the film stars Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, and Samuel L. Jackson. Six months after the events of Iron Man, Tony Stark is resisting calls by the United States government {{to hand over the}} Iron Man technology while also combating his declining health from the arc reactor in his chest. Meanwhile, rogue Russian scientist Ivan Vanko has developed <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>technology</b> and built weapons of his own in order to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family, in the process joining forces with Stark's business rival, Justin Hammer.|$|E
