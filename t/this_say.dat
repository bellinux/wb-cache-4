500|$|Reviews for [...] "Right Round" [...] {{were mostly}} negative. A {{reviewer}} for The New York Times called the song [...] "ionic and empty". In {{a review of}} R.O.O.T.S., Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe stated, [...] "His music is pure ear candy that must make Britney [...] envious, yet he wants to come off as a thug." [...] He continued that {{it is unlikely that}} [...] "Right Round" [...] would have gone over well in Brooklyn in the '80s, calling it [...] "as hard as Jell-O." [...] Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy stated in his review of the song, [...] "It's pretty difficult to ruin a pop classic, but Flo Rida gives it a pretty good stab here." [...] He added that [...] "Right Round" [...] is [...] "illed with more misogyny than a 1970s working mens' club", and called it [...] "an unpleasant affair that's only saved from the trashcan by its sample." [...] Fletcher concluded, [...] "The fuzzy synths, electro beats and infectious chorus hook sung by Kesha are almost enough to fool the casual listener into enjoying themselves. But sadly it's never too long before Flo Rida turns up again to spoil things." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "a horrendous rap remake of Dead or Alive's 'You Spin Me Round (Like a Record).'" [...] Noting that the song was, at the time, the number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, he added, [...] "What does all <b>this</b> <b>say</b> about us as a society? Mainly that we really, really enjoy cheesetastic '80s hair-pop hits in whatever form we can get 'em, I guess." ...|$|E
2500|$|Emperor Xizong's {{brother and}} {{successor}} Emperor Zhaozong eventually {{became aware of}} Zheng Qi's poems, as eunuchs recited them in their spare time. [...] Empeorr Zhaozong saw their biting satire and believed that they showed hidden talent. [...] In 894, he issued an edict making Zheng the deputy minister of rites (禮部侍郎, Libu Shilang) and a chancellor with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事). [...] When Zheng's assistants reported this to Zheng to congratulate him, Zheng himself did not take it seriously and stated, [...] "Gentlemen, you must have erred. [...] Even {{if no one else}} under heaven knew how to read, the Fifth Zheng cannot be a chancellor." [...] When the assistants insisted that this was the will of the emperor, he stated, [...] "If this is true, people will laugh to death." [...] When the edict announcing his chancellorship arrived the next day, along with congratulating guests, Zheng was confounded, stating to himself, [...] "If the Fifth Zheng, the xiehou writer, becomes chancellor, what does <b>this</b> <b>say</b> about the current state of governance?" [...] He submitted several petitions declining the commission, but the emperor took no heed of them, so he felt compelled to report to his post as a chancellor.|$|E
2500|$|Quranic and hadith traditions such as Sahih Bukhari {{as well as}} tafsir {{have given}} an oral {{depiction}} of what Jesus looked like, although some accounts do not match, such as Jesus being both curly haired and straight-haired. The hadith refer to Muhammad's account of the Night Journey, when {{he is supposed to}} have been taken up to heaven by the angel Gabriel (Jibra'il), where he saw Jesus and other prophets. Most versions of <b>this</b> <b>say</b> that [...] "Jesus had curly hair and a reddish complexion". Others say his face was flushed as if he just had a bath ("a reddish man with many freckles on his face {{as if he had just}} come from a bath"). In another account from Bukhari Jesus is seen in a dream near the Kaaba, as [...] "a man of a wheatish complexion with straight hair. I asked who it was. They said: This is the Messiah, son of Mary". However, other narrations give variations in the color. Salim ibn Abd-Allah reports from his father Abdullah ibn Umar that the prophet [...] "did not say that Jesus was of red complexion", rather he was [...] "a man of brown complexion and lank hair". In contrast Abd Allah ibn Abbas says that Jesus was of [...] "moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colors and of lank hair." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 8 March 1932, Puyi {{made his}} {{ceremonial}} entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng who was beaming with joy, Amakasu whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable. Puyi remembered about {{his first time}} in Changchun: [...] "I saw Japanese gendarmes, and rows of people, wearing all sots of clothes; some were in Chinese jackets and gowns, some were in Western suits and some in traditional Japanese dress, {{and they were all}} holding small flags in their hands. I was thrilled and reflected that I was now seeing the scene that I missed at the harbor. As I walked past them Hsi Hsia [...] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu [...] "bannermen" [...] who had been waiting for me to come for twenty years. These words brought tears to my eyes, and I was more strongly convinced than ever that my future was very hopeful". Puyi also noted he was [...] "too preoccupied with my hopes and hates" [...] to realize the [...] "cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me". Puyi's friend, the British journalist Woodhead, who covered his arrival in Manchuria, wrote [...] "outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorized by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin [...] "lawless... even its main street unsafe after dark". In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi stated he planned to govern Manchukuo “in the Confucian spirit” and he was “perfectly happy” with his new position. An Italian journalist from the Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote: “I was unable to interview this pale, tired prince who doesn’t’ like to talk, who is always plunged in his meditations and who maybe regrets his life as a simple, studious citizen. He has a fixed stare behind his black-framed glasses. When we were introduced, he responded with a friendly nod. But his smile lasted only a second. We could only await the word of the Master of Ceremonies to give us permission to bow ourselves out. A Japanese colonel, our guide, showed us the triumphal arches, the electric light decorations and endless flags. But all <b>this,</b> <b>say</b> the shopkeepers is [...] "made in Osaka"”.|$|E
