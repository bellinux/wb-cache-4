40|$|AbstractOverhead {{transmission}} lines are always covered by ice in freezing weather. It's {{difficult to know}} about the icing condition of the lines because they usually have large area-span. They will be stretched under the combined action of conductor quality, wind force and ice-covering. This paper deduces the relationship of conductor-weight ratio, iceweight ratio, wind-pressure ratio and conductor length, and proposes a novel <b>thickness</b> detection method <b>of</b> ice <b>covering</b> on overhead line. This method uses travelling wave location equipments to collect travelling wave signal which a circuit breaker generates. The signal's arrival time is detected by Hilbert-Huang Transformation. Then the length of the line can be calculated. Finally, the average <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> ice <b>covering</b> on transmission line would be calculated by using the formula of the relationship between comprehensive conductor load ratio and ice thickness.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} model describing the nonstationary temperature field in a bimetallic contact {{consisting of a}} basic material and a covering is presented. It {{is based on the}} axially symmetric heat equation with the boundary conditions including an arc heat flux entering the covering surface and the ideal heat contact on the interface between covering and the basic material. The arc heat flux consists of the several components relating to the heating due to the electron and ion bombardment, arc radiation, inverse electrons, and cooling due to the electron emission, melting and evaporation. The dynamics of all these components is calculated for the brass contacts with the AgCdO covering. It is found that the transition from the metallic arc phase to the gaseous arc phase occurs due to dynamical redistribution of the arc heat components. The resulting temperature fields in the basic contact and the covering enable us to choose the parameters for the optimal <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>covering...</b>|$|E
40|$|It is {{of great}} {{significance}} for the protective design of submarine to study the influences of coverings on the damage characteristics of single and double cylindrical shells subjected to underwater contact explosions. The SPH models of single and double cylindrical shells coated with foam silicone rubber are established to analyze shockwave propagation, damage characteristics, and elastoplastic responses, which provides reasonable parameters of covering position and thickness. The results can be concluded as follows: the superposition of multiple waves may cause the inhomogeneity and discontinuity; for the single cylindrical shell with inner or outer coverings, the damage mode is mainly tensile and shear failure is caused by detonation waves and detonation products; compared with out-covering approach, the in-covering approach has better antishock performance; the best protective effect comes out when the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>covering</b> is close {{to that of the}} shell; as for the double cylindrical shell without interlayer water, the destruction of inner shell mainly results from the puncture of high-speed fragments from the outer shell, so for the outer shell, out-covering is a better choice; however, since the interlayer water is very effective in protecting the inner shell, in-covering will be better for the inner shell...|$|E

Earth covering method with sheet or net has been developed from 1966 to 1967 in Japan {{for the security of}} traficability. Recently, the earth covering excution with geotextiles has gradually increased. However, a rational design for the earth covering method with the reinforced materials, has not been established, because of the variation of the ground condition, the tensile stress within the geotextiles and the <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> <b>covering</b> layer according with excution procedure.

40|$|Objective: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that coating platinum coils with transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) would improve the cellular proliferation within experimental aneurysms relative to uncoated coils. Materials and methods: Elastase-induced saccular aneurysms were created in 12 New Zealand White rabbits. These aneurysms were embolized with platinum coils, either "control" (unmodified) coils or "test" (coated with TGF beta) coils. Subjects were killed either 2 weeks (n = 3, control; n = 3, test) or 6 weeks (n = 3, control; n = 3, test) after embolization. Aneurysm tissue was embedded in plastic, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> tissue <b>covering</b> the coils at the coil-lumen interface was measured by use of a digital microscope, and was compared between groups by use of the Student's t test (P {{less than or equal}} to 0. 05).

Six-week implantation samples demonstrated mean <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> tissue overlying TGF beta -coated coils of 86 +/- 74 mum versus mean thickness overlying control coils of 37 +/- 6 mu; this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0. 30). <b>Thickness</b> <b>of</b> tissue <b>covering</b> TGF beta -coated coils did not change significantly from 2 to 6 weeks (P = 0. 31).

Hyper-spectral images were taken with a camera fitted on a surgical microscope. High-resolution images with 70 nm interval between 440 and 720 nm were obtained within 30 s (1392 x 1024 pixels). Black- and white-point reference was used for spatial and spectral normalization as well as correction for motion during exposure. Reflection spectra were extracted from the image on a line mid-buccal of the implant, starting 1 mm above the soft tissue continuing up to 3 mm apically. Results: Median soft tissue height is 2. 3 mm (min: 1. 2 mm and max: 3. 1 mm). The buccal mucosa rapidly increases in the thickness, when moving apically. At 2. 2 mm, thickness is 3 mm.
