5|$|Detective Mike Banner invites Chris for an {{interview}} {{in relation to the}} murder. Beforehand, Chris throws Mrs. Eastby's jewelry and drugs into the river, but by chance her ring bounces on <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> falls to the pavement. At the police station, Chris lies about his relationship with Nola, but Banner surprises him with her diary, in which he is featured extensively. He confesses his affair but denies any link to the murder, and appeals to the detectives not to involve him further in their investigation as news of the affair may end his marriage just as he and his wife are expecting a baby.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the guns were small iron guns with short range that could be aimed and fired by a single person. The two most common are the bases, breech-loading swivel guns, most likely placed in the castles, and hailshot pieces, small muzzle-loaders with rectangular bores and fin-like protrusions {{that were used to}} support the guns against <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> allow the ship structure to take the force of the recoil. Though the design is unknown, there were two top pieces in a 1546 inventory (finished after the sinking) which was probably similar to a base, but placed in {{one or more of the}} fighting tops.|$|E
25|$|The House of Lords {{has also}} been {{targeted}} by protesters. On 2February 1988, the House debated the Local Government Bill's controversial Clause 28, a measure to prohibit the promotion of homosexuality in schools. Following the division, in which the clause passed, a number of lesbian demonstrators in the public gallery started chanting slogans, and three of them tied ropes to <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> climbed down onto {{the floor of the}} Chamber. Lord Monkswell, who had provided the women with passes to attend the debate, later apologised to the House for the incident but did not criticise the protest.|$|E

500|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone was first noted on July11 east of Luzon. It moved generally to the west-northwest {{for a few}} days before curving to the northwest. On July15, the steamer [...] Tjikandi encountered the typhoon, estimating winds of 160km/h (100mph); two quartermasters were washed overboard, and <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> hatches were wrecked. On July17, the typhoon struck southeastern Taiwan and moved across the southern portion of the island, where Hengchun recorded a barometric pressure of 978mbar (28.89inHg). Crossing the Taiwan Strait, the storm entered southeastern China near Xiamen on July17, and dissipated the next day.|$|E
500|$|.....as soon as I got out I {{climbed on}} to <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> threw myself {{out to the}} wire-netting, a {{distance}} of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was [...] "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, on to the iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, {{as it was a}} clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught {{on the edge of the}} netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.|$|E
500|$|Out of the {{starting}} gate, Ecole Etage took the lead, ahead of Torsion, while race favorite Secretariat exited last. Sham and Deadly Dream made contact exiting the gate. While Sham {{was able to}} successfully gain stride, Deadly Dream began to run towards <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> collided with it when entering the first turn. Going into the course's first turn, Secretariat passed two horses {{on the outside and}} passed the remainder as the horses entered the backstretch. Sham was the only horse that was able to stay with Secretariat's acceleration. Secretariat held the lead {{for the remainder of the}} race and crossed the finish line in first position, [...] lengths ahead of Sham. Our Native placed third, eight lengths behind Sham. This was the first time in the history of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes that the top three horses in the Derby finished in the same positions at the Preakness.|$|E

500|$|In 1921 {{the couple}} went to Europe where Tunis freelanced {{as a sports}} writer for American {{publications}} and played in some tennis tournaments on the Riviera, including a match against King Gustaf V of Sweden, who was 70 at the time. Tunis also played a doubles match against the French women's champion Suzanne Lenglen. Returning to the U.S. {{at the end of}} the summer, he dropped in on former Harvard classmate Lawrence Winship, the Sunday editor of The Boston Globe. When Winship learned that Tunis actually knew the flamboyant Lenglen, he insisted he write an article about her for the Globe before leaving the building. The pressure of that deadline caused him such anxiety that after half an hour of struggle he went to the building's fire escape, [...] "leaned over <b>the</b> <b>railing,</b> <b>and</b> threw up. I'll never forget it. I wiped my face with copy paper. But I did the story." [...] Between 1920 and 1940 Tunis freelanced for a number of major magazines, including Reader's Digest, Harper's, Atlantic Monthly, Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire, writing primarily on two topics: sports and education. He also covered sports for the New York Evening Post from 1925 to 1932 and had a weekly column in The New Yorker. According to Norman Cousins in Writing for Love or Money, Tunis was known for producing [...] "fact-packed articles based upon research". Working six days a week and taking the seventh to play tennis, Tunis published over 2,000 articles and short stories, becoming one ofAmerica's premier sportswriters.|$|E
500|$|The Octagon House (1799 New York Avenue NW) is {{reported}} to be the most haunted home in D.C. It was built in 1801 by Colonel John Tayloe III. The Tayloes were a greatly distinguished Virginia family: His grandfather, Colonel John Tayloe (d. 1747), {{was a member of the}} King's Council in Virginia and owner of more than [...] of land (a huge estate at the time), and his father, Colonel John Tayloe II, built the historic Mount Airy manor house in 1758 and was also a member of the King's Council. John Tayloe III was a close friend of George Washington's, and Washington convinced Tayloe to build a winter home in the new city of Washington. There is some evidence that the walled back yard of The Octagon itself may have served as a slave market, and it is well-established that the rear of the building housed the Tayloe family's slaves. The Tayloe family was exceptionally well-connected, and their home was an important one in the city. After the burning of the White House in the War of 1812, President James and Dolley Madison lived there from September 1814 to October 1815, and Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent (which ended the war) there in February 1815. Apparitions and the presence of otherworldly forces have been seen and felt in many places at The Octagon, including on the spiral staircase, the second floor landing, the third floor landing, the third floor bedroom, and the garden area in the rear. Among the eyewitnesses have been members of the public, and curators and other employees hired by the museum which owns the house. Two of Colonel Tayloe's daughters are said to haunt The Octagon. The first allegedly died before the War of 1812. Colonel Tayloe and his daughter quarreled on the second floor landing over the girl's relationship with a British officer stationed in the city. When the daughter turned in anger to go down the stairs, she fell down the stairs (or over the railing; stories differ) and died. Her specter is allegedly seen crumpled at the bottom of the steps or on the stairs near the second floor landing, and sometimes exhibits itself as the light of a candle moving up the staircase. The other death, stories claim, occurred in 1817 or shortly thereafter. Another of Colonel Tayloe's daughters eloped with a young man, incurring her father's wrath. When she returned home to reconcile with her father, they argued on the third-floor landing. This daughter, too, fell to her death down the stairs (or over <b>the</b> <b>railing),</b> <b>and</b> her shade is alleged to haunt the third floor landing and stairs between the second and third floors.|$|E

2500|$|On a November 2011 Art of Wrestling podcast, Dreamer told host Colt Cabana {{his family}} is [...] "connected" [...] to the New York mafia. After {{one of his first}} matches in Brooklyn, which dozens of his local {{relatives}} attended, he was attacked from behind and beaten down by Sweet William (better known as Bill DeMott). Unaware of wrestling's scripted nature, several of his relatives at ringside got angry. His grandfather jumped <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> tried to fight off security guards. His aunt told DeMott as he passed that she would [...] "put a hit" [...] on him (the misunderstanding was peacefully resolved).|$|E
2500|$|The Tibetan saint and bridge-builder Thangtong Gyalpo {{originated}} {{the use of}} iron chains in {{his version}} of simple suspension bridges. In 1433, Gyalpo built eight bridges in eastern Bhutan. The last surviving chain-linked bridge of Gyalpo's was the Thangtong Gyalpo Bridge in Duksum en route to Trashi Yangtse, which was finally washed away in 2004. Gyalpo's iron chain bridges {{did not include a}} suspended deck bridge which is the standard on [...] all modern suspension bridges today. Instead, both <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> the walking layer of Gyalpo's bridges used wires. The stress points that carried the screed were reinforced by the iron chains. Before the use of iron chains it is thought that Gyalpo used ropes from twisted willows or yak skins. He may have also used tightly bound cloth.|$|E

2500|$|The band's first album, Tender Years, {{became a}} major hit, but {{recording}} their next album, A Season in Hell, {{turns out to be}} a nightmare. Inspired by the bleak, fatalistic poetry of Arthur Rimbaud, Eddie pushes his bandmates beyond their limits, musically and personally. Eddie wants to be great, but bassist Sal replies, [...] "We ain't great. We're just some guys from Jersey." [...] Eddie makes this clear that if the band cannot be great, there is no reason to ever play music again. A Season in Hell is ultimately rejected by Satin Records on the grounds that it is [...] "dark and strange". In the early morning hours, Eddie's car crashes through <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> <b>and</b> over the Stainton Memorial Causeway. Eddie vanishes without a trace, his body never found.|$|E
