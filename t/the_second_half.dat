United fashioned further chances through Burke and Rowley, but for large periods of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> the Arsenal defence stood firm. Jones' headed goal was rule out for offside, after which the match descended into a contest between United's attack and Arsenal's defence. Jimmy Delaney came closest to equalising late on, when he darted forward and missed by inches.|$|E

5|$|Because Air Force {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half.</b> Tech returned the kickoff to its 25-yard line, where the Hokie offense began the first drive of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half.</b> The Tech offense used rushes by Lee Suggs and passes by Bryan Randall to pick up several first downs and drive into Air Force territory. But once on the Falcons' side of the field, Tech proved unable to gain another first down and was even pushed back into its own territory by a penalty. Tech was forced to punt, and Air Force began its first offensive possession of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> at its 20-yard line after a touchback.|$|E
