50|$|Infused oils {{are also}} used for seasoning. There are two methods for doing an {{infusion}}—hot and cold. Olive oil makes a good infusion base for some herbs, but tends <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>rancid</b> more quickly than other oils. Infused oils should be kept refrigerated.|$|R
50|$|To help {{preserve}} oils from rancidification, {{they should be}} stored in a dark place, stored in oxygen-safe, light-reducing containers (e.g. dark glass or metal). Once opened, oils should be refrigerated and used within a few weeks, when some types begin <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>rancid.</b> Unopened oils can have a storage life of up to one year, but some types have a shorter shelf-life even when unopened (such as sesame and flaxseed).|$|R
50|$|Oils and fats {{can begin}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>rancid</b> quickly when not stored safely. Rancid cooking {{oils and fats}} do not often smell rancid until well after they have spoiled. Oxygen, light and heat all {{contribute}} to cooking oils becoming rancid. The higher the level of polyunsaturated fat that an oil contains, the faster it spoils. The percentage of polyunsaturated fat in some common cooking oils is: safflower (74%); sunflower (66%); corn (60%); soybean (37%); peanut (32%); canola (29%); olive (8%); coconut (5%).|$|R
25|$|After use Dutch ovens are {{typically}} cleaned like other cast-iron cookware: with {{boiling water and}} a brush, and no soap. After the oven has been dried, it {{should be given a}} thin coating of cooking oil to prevent rusting. Whether that should be a vegetable fat or an animal fat (such as lard) is hotly contested. Saturated fats are more stable than polyunsaturated fats, which tend <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>rancid</b> more quickly. If the oven is used regularly, this poses no issue. Mustard oil provides the highest temperature resistance, which would be conducive to cooking.|$|R
5000|$|The oat, {{like other}} cereals, has a hard, {{inedible}} outer husk {{that must be}} removed before the grain can be eaten. After the outer husk (or chaff) {{has been removed from}} the still bran-covered oat grains, the remainder is called oat groats. Since the bran layer, though nutritious, makes the grains tough to chew and contains an enzyme that can cause the oats <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>rancid,</b> raw oat groats are often further steam-treated to soften them for a quicker cooking time (modern [...] "quick oats") and to denature the enzymes for a longer shelf life.|$|R

Desperate to escape prison, he pays a fortune to the mysterious Doncaster Corporation for a new identity (and a new body and personality <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with it). However, Doncaster tricks him, sending him as an unwilling emigrant to the extraterrestrial colony on planet Pluto. Although it has been terraformed into a pleasant enough abode, Pluto is thoroughly neglected by a narcissistic Earth, and only ne'er-do-wells and misfits settle it. Sibley, with no marketable skills, is drafted into the Plutonian army, which is building an anomalously large war machine. His new commanding persona makes him swiftly rise in rank, and he soon concludes that Pluto intends to invade and plunder its neglectful mother planet. Instead, Doncaster suddenly reveals that the Pluto colony was created by them as a stepping-stone to the stars, and that Earth will be left <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>rancid,</b> while [...] "new men", like the rebuilt Sibley, conquer the universe.|$|R

50|$|In the 1960's, {{a regular}} non pedigreed white {{domestic}} longhaired cat named Josephine produced several litters of typical cats. Josephine {{was of a}} Persian/Angora type and had litters sired by several unknown male Birman or Burmese-like cats, one of which had the Siamese point coloration. Josephine later produced kittens with a docile, placid temperament, affectionate nature, and a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> limp and relaxed when picked up. When a subsequent litter produced more of the same, Ann Baker purchased several kittens from the owner who lived behind her and, believing that she had something special, set out to create what {{is now known as}} the ragdoll.

30|$|The {{increased}} phenol removal by adsorption onto R. stricta {{activated carbon}} observed {{as the temperature}} was raised from 25 to 45  °C can be explained {{on the basis of}} hydrogen bonding. According to Nayak and Singh (2007), there exists extensive hydrogen bonding between the phenol molecule and water in aqueous solution of phenol resulting in appreciable solubility. This hydrogen bonding gets broken at higher temperatures and, this would cause phenol to be less soluble and, therefore, exhibit a higher <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the adsorbent surface and adsorbed rather than remaining in solution.|$|R
50|$|Wooden boards {{should never}} {{be placed in the}} dishwasher, or left {{immersed}} for long periods, as the wood or glue may be affected. To prevent cracking, cutting boards can be treated when they start looking dry. A standard recommendation is 5-7 times a year, or as needed. A light food-grade mineral oil is a good preservative for wooden cutting boards, as it helps keep water from seeping into the grain. Alternatively, one may also use a food-grade drying oil such as poppyseed oil, tung oil or linseed oil. The first two dry much faster than linseed. Most commercially available linseed and tung oils are not “food grade”, as they contain metallic driers. In general, edible savory vegetable or olive oils are not recommended because they tend <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>rancid,</b> causing the board to smell and food to pick up the rancid taste. When heavily or deeply scored, wooden boards need to be resurfaced as scoring can harbour bacteria. Boards can be easily resurfaced with various woodworking tools, such as scrapers or planes, even sandpaper.|$|R
5000|$|Lamb is {{reputed to}} be the {{inventor}} of the [...] "bulger" [...] golf club, a wood with a convex face, circa 1885. In his 1890 book Golf, Horace Hutchinson advises that the theory behind the convex face is that shots hit on the heel will have less of a <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the right and shots struck nearer the toe will have a lesser <b>tendency</b> of traveling <b>to</b> the left of your target. Meanwhile, a shot struck in the sweet spot (center of the clubface) will be unaffected. All woods and metal woods of the modern era incorporate Lamb's invention.|$|R
