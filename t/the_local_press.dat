Shakur again attempted to remove the trial to federal court. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey denied the petition and also denied Shakur an injunction against the holding of trial proceedings on Fridays (the Muslim Sabbath). An en banc panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.|$|E
5|$|At each venue, {{the concert}} {{was treated as}} a major event by <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>press</b> and {{attended}} by between ten and twenty thousand fans, whose enthusiastic response to the Beatles produced sound levels that left the music only semi-audible. The tour earned the Beatles over a million dollars in ticket sales. It also stimulated a further increase in record sales, and resulted in the sale of a considerable quantity of Beatle-related merchandise.|$|E

The war memorial committee appointed Percy Worthington, a local architect, as the assessor for the competition but attracted severe criticism in <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>press</b> when it reserved the right to veto Worthington's choice.

He discussed the issue in Foreningen Kristiansunderen where it received support. Løvold was an important enthusiast for the fixed link project, which would materialize as the Kristiansund and Frei Fixed Link in 1992. <b>The</b> <b>local</b> <b>press</b> dubbed him the fixed link general. In 1955 he organized an inspection of Freifjorden; using echo sounding it was possible to survey the depth of the fjord.

He told <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>press</b> that he felt disrespected the way Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe had handled his contract – he had taken a pay cut to move from Derby, a 40% pay cut following relegation, and then the new contract offer was lower still than his current contract.|$|E

5|$|Hammond {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Gloucestershire in August 1920. Although his first four innings yielded only 27 runs, <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>press</b> saw enough to predict a great future for him. He spent the winter {{working on a}} farm on the Isle of Wight, then moved to Bristol {{for the start of}} the 1921 English cricket season. Playing only two first-class matches in 1921, both against the powerful Australian tourists, Hammond scored two runs in three innings, overwhelmed by fast bowler Jack Gregory. In between these games, Gloucestershire arranged his appointment as assistant coach at Clifton College, Bristol, where he worked on his batting technique with former county cricketers John Tunnicliffe and George Dennett.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, many {{counties}} in Pennsylvania were staunch {{supporters of the}} Democratic Party, while the newly {{elected president of the}} United States was the Republican Abraham Lincoln. When a large number of men were drafted from Columbia County, tensions led to raids and arrests in Columbia and neighboring counties. As early as 1862, <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>press</b> expressed outrage at a draft of 636 men, mostly mechanics and laborers. An 1863 law requiring all men from 20 to 45 years old to be drafted increased tensions further. On July 20 locals broke into the district draft office and stole the items inside. But besides this event, there was little active violence against officials of the 1863 draft.|$|E

She had accused him in front of others of cheating at cards; it was one of several scenes she had caused between them and he walked out on her.

5|$|Leaving Cirencester in July 1920, Hammond {{planned to}} go to Winchester Agricultural College, {{following}} the path into farming mapped out by his mother. However, his plans changed when his headmaster wrote to the captain of Gloucestershire, Foster Robinson, reporting Hammond's school cricket record and suggesting that they {{take a look at}} him. Hammond, who scored a century in his first appearance in adult cricket days after leaving school, played in a trial match for the Gloucestershire Club and Ground, scoring 60 runs, taking two wickets and impressing <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>press.</b> Subsequently, two members of Gloucestershire's committee visited Hammond's mother in an attempt to sign him for the club. Hammond's mother was initially reluctant, but his eagerness finally convinced her and he signed a professional contract.|$|E
5|$|Moore and Nash {{were on the}} organising {{committee}} of the International Surrealist Exhibition, {{which took place in}} London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the front garden of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>press</b> ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings.|$|E

On 2 May local Labour Party Alderman Henry Hennessey spoke of the apparent collusion between bus company management and the TGWU over the colour bar. On 3 May, the ruling Labour Group on the city council threatened him with expulsion, despite his honourable service of over forty years.|$|E

5|$|This left Australia {{to chase}} 404 runs for victory. At the time, {{this would have}} been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>press</b> wrote them off, {{predicting}} that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating spinners' wicket. Morris and Hassett started slowly, with only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch that offered spin and bounce. Only 44 runs came in the first hour, leaving 360 runs needed in 285 minutes. Both players survived close calls before Hassett fell at 1/57.|$|E
5|$|While {{working on}} the Sibiu-based Astra {{magazine}} Transilvania (where he sometimes used the signature AG), Agârbiceanu remained the editor of Patria until 1927, and also resumed his collaboration with Viața Românească. However, he was disappointed by the cultural and economic decline which came {{as a consequence of}} Transylvania's incorporation: <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>press,</b> he noted, had largely lost its purpose and could not hope to survive competition. As noted by reviewers from Ilie Rad to Răzvan Voncu, some of Agârbiceanu's more valuable work saw print in minor provincial reviews.|$|E
5|$|A plan {{to fill in}} {{a section}} of the canal in Nottingham {{resulted}} in a number of letters appearing in <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>press</b> in 1963, and a student at Kesteven College produced a report {{on the state of the}} canal, which was presented to the Grantham Civic Society. In 1970, the British Waterways Board attempted to obtain an act of parliament which would have allowed them to cease maintaining the water levels of the canal. The Inland Waterways Association campaigned against the bill, and the clause was amended. The Grantham Canal Society was formed soon afterwards, to promote restoration of the waterway. In 1974, a National Boat Rally was held at Nottingham, to gain support for the restoration scheme, and to promote the idea of a new link to the Trent, which would pass through old gravel workings.|$|E
