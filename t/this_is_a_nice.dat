2500|$|The show {{features}} a laugh track, something Ullman was hesitant about using. [...] "That's a very BBC thing to do. I hate {{things like that}} on a show. But when we played it, it kind of worked. It makes it sound like you're connecting with people. Comedy has gotten a bit cold lately, and neurotic and depressed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> BBC One family show. It's not too arch or bleak." [...] All laughter is genuine and was captured via live screenings before a studio audience at BBC Radio Theatre.|$|E

5000|$|Although Adventures <b>were</b> {{attached}} to <b>a</b> Sea, they <b>were</b> only {{available to the}} player that attached them (barring other card effects). <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> way to [...] "archive" [...] uncompleted adventures without cluttering your hand.

5000|$|A {{review in}} Freechristmusic.com said, [...] "Sometimes when {{downloading}} mixtapes from people you haven't {{heard of before}} {{you go through a}} lot of stuff with really bad production. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> surprise it sounds great, clearly some well done production on this one." ...|$|R

50|$|One {{significant}} advantage {{offered by}} DASH recorders over the analog recorders {{of the day}} was that 'proper' tape biasing was unimportant, as there is no means for the tape to 'color' the sound of the recorded data. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> advantage, and routine maintenance amounted to not much more than keeping the tape guides clean. Due to this fact, the formulation of tape does not change the sound quality, unlike analog machines which must be set for specific formulae.|$|R

The weakness of this style as revealed by Yan Tieh (told by his master) is to attack both the opponent's upper and lower body in a simultaneous assault.|$|R
5000|$|Billy Dukes of Taste of Country gave [...] "Night Train" [...] {{three out}} of five stars.

As we had a roast pig for dinner we kept him for that meal; and the rain coming on just when the moon should have risen kept him again for the night. So you see it is now to-morrow.|$|E

Little Master Whiskey said to himself, [...] "Surely <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice,</b> kind lady, to take so much pains to give me nuts; she is certainly very considerate;" [...] and with that he edged a little nearer and nearer every day, until, quite {{to the delight of}} the small lady, he would come and climb into her lap and seize the nuts, when she rattled them there, and after that he seemed to make exploring voyages all over her person. He would climb up and sit on her shoulder; he would mount and perch himself on her head; and when she held a nut for him between her teeth, he would take it out of her mouth.|$|E
60|$|Evening.--Lloyd has returned. Peace and {{war were}} played {{before his eyes}} at heads or tails. A German was stopped with {{levelled}} guns; he raised his whip; had it fallen, {{we might have been}} now in war. Excuses were made by Mataafa himself. Doubtless the thing was done--I mean the stopping of the German--a little to show off before Lloyd. Meanwhile ---- was up here, telling how the Chief Justice was really gone for five or eight weeks, and begging me to write to the Times and denounce the state of affairs; many strong reasons he advanced; and Lloyd and I have been since his arrival and ----'s departure, near half an hour, debating what should be done. Cedercrantz is gone; it is not my fault; he knows my views on that point--alone of all points;--he leaves me with my mouth sealed. Yet <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> thing that because he is guilty of a fresh offence--his flight--the mouth of the only possible influential witness should be closed? I do not like this argument. I look like a cad, if I do in the man's absence what I could have done in a more manly manner in his presence. True; but why did he go? It is his last sin. And I, who like the man extremely--that is the word--I love his society--he is intelligent, pleasant, even witty, a gentleman--and you know how that attaches--I loathe to seem to play a base part; but the poor natives--who are like other folk, false enough, lazy enough, not heroes, not saints--ordinary men damnably misused--are they to suffer because I like Cedercrantz, and Cedercrantz has cut his lucky? This is a little tragedy, observe well--a tragedy! I may be right, I may be wrong in my judgment, but I am in treaty with my honour. I know not how it will seem to-morrow. Lloyd thought the barrier of honour insurmountable, and it is an ugly obstacle. He (Cedercrantz) will likely meet my wife three days from now, may travel back with her, will be charming if he does; suppose this, and suppose him to arrive and find that I have sprung a mine--or the nearest approach to it I could find--behind his back? My position is pretty. Yes, I am an aristocrat. I have the old petty, personal view of honour? I should blush till I die if I do this; yet it is on the cards that I may do it. So much I have written you in bed, as a man writes or talks, in a bittre Wahl. Now I shall sleep, and see if I am more clear. I will consult the missionaries at least--I place some reliance in M. also--or I should if he were not a partisan; but a partisan he is. There's a pity. To sleep! A fund of wisdom in the prostrate body and the fed brain. Kindly observe R. L. S. in the talons of politics! 'Tis funny--'tis sad. Nobody but these cursed idiots could have so driven me; I cannot bear idiots.|$|E
