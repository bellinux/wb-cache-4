5|$|Declassification of British {{government}} archives {{has allowed}} scholars {{to piece together}} the choreography of <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> of the declaration; in his widely cited 1961 book, Leonard Stein published four previous drafts of the declaration.|$|E
5|$|ML Pin became Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education in 1946. In this capacity, {{he oversaw}} the {{founding}} in 1949 of the Higher Teacher Training School at Prasanmit, now Srinakharinwirot University, and <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> {{of the first}} national education plan.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> edited <b>draft</b> {{is to be}} {{forwarded}} to the NRC to further be approved or disapproved in whole. The approval or disapproval must be adopted within 15 days after the NRC receives <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> and <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> cannot be edited again. If <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> is approved, <b>the</b> NRC president presents it to the king for the royal signature and the NRC president also countersigns <b>the</b> <b>draft.</b> Section 37 permits the king to veto <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> constitution.|$|R
30|$|A {{comparison}} of the mode shapes of each <b>draft</b> pad in <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> gear with mode shapes of an individual draft pad is done. It is observed that first five mode shapes of <b>the</b> individual <b>draft</b> pad are dominating the behaviour of each <b>draft</b> pad in <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> gear for all 15 mode shapes of <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> gear. This is because <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> pads housed in <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> gear have their own individual behaviour which cumulatively results in different mode shapes of <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> gear. These mode shapes of draft gear as such have no resemblance with mode shapes of an individual draft pad.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>draft</b> {{laws are}} {{presented}} to the Seimas, which can vote to commence the procedure of consideration of <b>the</b> <b>draft,</b> postpone it or reject <b>the</b> <b>draft.</b> If <b>the</b> Seimas decides to commence the procedure of consideration, it appoints the principal and additional Committees to consider <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> law.|$|R

5|$|By 1844 {{there were}} 60 private patients. The {{building}} was refronted and a chapel added in 1851. The {{design of the}} buildings and the therapeutic regime were seen as models to be followed elsewhere, including at the General Lunatic Asylum of Nottingham at Sneinton, and <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> of the 1808 County Asylums Act and Lunacy Act 1845.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>draft</b> {{was held}} on 22 October 2015 in Dhaka. Six franchises participated in <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> method.

50|$|Entering <b>the</b> 2017 NBA <b>draft</b> deadline, Fultz {{was widely}} {{expected}} to be the first pick of <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> that year. Shortly before <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> began, Fultz signed a multi-year shoe endorsement deal with Nike. Three days before <b>draft</b> night began, <b>the</b> Philadelphia 76ers traded the third pick in <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> as well as a future first-round pick to the Boston Celtics for the first pick of <b>the</b> <b>draft.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>draft,</b> <b>the</b> 76ers selected Fultz with first overall pick.|$|R
50|$|A {{player who}} is not {{automatically}} eligible must declare his eligibility for <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> by notifying <b>the</b> NBA offices in writing no later than 60 days before <b>the</b> <b>draft.</b> For <b>the</b> 2009 <b>draft,</b> this date fell on April 26. An early entry candidate is allowed to withdraw his eligibility for <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> by notifying <b>the</b> NBA offices in writing no later than 10 days before <b>the</b> <b>draft.</b> This year, a total of 74 collegiate players and 29 international players declared as early entry candidates.

It also includes a number of stills from the film as well as character profiles.|$|E
5|$|The painting, {{the figures}} painted from life when possible, {{does not contain}} all the signers. Some had died and images could not be located. One figure had participated in <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> but did not sign the final document; another refused to sign. In fact the {{membership}} of the Second Continental Congress changed as time passed, and the figures in the painting were never in the same room at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the statue}} and framed by marble pilasters {{is a window}} that depicts scenes from Philadelphia history. In the window's {{tympanum}} is a depiction of Independence Hall. Below that are pictures showing William Penn's treaty with the Indians, George Washington's Farewell Address to Congress, the proclamation of the Declaration of Independence, the Philadelphia Convention, <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> of the Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin's printing office, Betsy Ross exhibiting the United States flag, and Caesar Rodney's ride from Delaware. The border of the window contains portrait busts of notable American Revolution-era Philadelphians: John Bartram, George Clymer, Robert Morris, David Rittenhouse, Benjamin Rush, and James Wilson.|$|E

5|$|Between April 1947 and December 1948, when George C. Marshall was Secretary of State, Kennan {{was more}} {{influential}} {{than he was}} at any other period in his career. Marshall valued his strategic sense and had him create and direct what is now named the Policy Planning Staff, the State Department's internal think tank. Kennan became the first Director of Policy Planning. Marshall relied heavily on him to prepare policy recommendations. Kennan {{played a central role}} in <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> of the Marshall Plan.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{ordered the}} {{refurbishing}} {{of the state}} penitentiary, which had been damaged by a fire, and called for an extensive state geological survey. He also advised {{the creation of a}} sinking fund to retire the state's debt. The state adopted a new constitution during Crittenden's term, though Crittenden was not a delegate to the constitutional convention and apparently had little influence on <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> of the document. Most Whigs opposed the calling of a constitutional convention because it would necessarily involve reapportionment of the state's legislative districts and threaten Whig dominance in the General Assembly; nevertheless, Crittenden belatedly supported the call for a convention during his 1848 gubernatorial campaign.|$|E
5|$|Garran {{joked that}} the long work of <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> {{committee}} breached the Factory Acts, the group (primarily Barton, Richard O'Connor, John Downer and Garran) often working {{late into the night}} preparing drafts for the convention to consider and debate the next morning. On the evening before the convention's last day, Barton had gone to bed exhausted in the small hours, Garran and Charles Gavan Duffy finishing the final schedule of amendments at breakfast time. The convention concluded successfully, approving a final draft which would ultimately, aside from a small amendment arranged at the last minute in London, become the Constitution of Australia.|$|E
500|$|In a three-team trade, Portland {{acquired}} <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> {{rights to}} 25th pick Nicolas Batum from Houston, Houston acquired <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> rights to 33rd pick Joey Dorsey from Portland and <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> rights to 28th pick Donté Greene and a 2009 second-round draft pick from Memphis, and Memphis acquired <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> rights to 27th pick Darrell Arthur from Portland.|$|R

50|$|At the {{conclusion}} of each AFL season, there are three AFL drafts: <b>the</b> National <b>Draft,</b> <b>the</b> Pre-Season <b>Draft</b> and <b>the</b> Rookie <b>Draft.</b> <b>The</b> National <b>Draft</b> is <b>the</b> most important of <b>the</b> <b>drafts,</b> {{as it is the}} primary recruitment method for prospective young players once they reach the age of 18.|$|R
5|$|Henry {{personally}} presided at {{the trial}} of John Lambert in November 1538 for denying the real presence. At the same time, he shared in <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> of a proclamation giving Anabaptists and Sacramentaries ten days {{to get out of}} the country. In 1539 Parliament passed the Six Articles reaffirming Roman Catholic practices such as transubstantiation, clerical celibacy and the importance of confession to a priest and prescribed penalties if anyone denied them. Henry himself observed the Easter Triduum in that year with some display.|$|E
5|$|Mays, Lapsley, Almond, Wickham, and Boatwright spent August 6 {{engaged in}} {{additional}} legislative drafting. That same day, Governor Stanley withdrew his school funding bill from consideration by <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> committee {{and asked that}} Almond draft a stronger version which permitted a funding cut-off whether a district integrated voluntarily or not. Kenneth Patty, Assistant Attorney General, ended up drafting the revised bill for the governor. After four days of work, Patty finished his draft of the funding cut-off legislation on August 13.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Europe he was elected Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers and {{assigned}} to participate in <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> and preparation of documents for the upcoming Second Vatican Council (1962–65) announced by Pope John XXIII, and was a major leader of the conservative bloc during its proceedings. He would later {{take the lead in}} opposing certain changes within the Church associated with the Council. Refusing to implement council-inspired reforms demanded by its members, he resigned from the leadership of the Holy Ghost Fathers in 1968.|$|E
50|$|A {{player who}} is not {{automatically}} eligible must declare his eligibility for <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> by notifying <b>the</b> NBA offices in writing no later than 60 days before <b>the</b> <b>draft.</b> For <b>the</b> 2010 <b>draft,</b> this date fell on April 25. Under NCAA rules that take effect with this draft, they only had until May 8 to withdraw from <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> and maintain their college eligibility. Previously, players who declared for <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> could withdraw as late as 10 days before <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> (<b>the</b> withdrawal deadline under the CBA) and still maintain college eligibility. This year, a total of 80 collegiate players and 23 international players declared as early entry candidates. At the withdrawal deadline, 48 early entry candidates withdrew from <b>the</b> <b>draft,</b> leaving 50 collegiate players and five international players as the early entry candidates for <b>the</b> <b>draft.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>draft</b> {{order was}} to be {{determined}} by two coin tosses: one for <b>the</b> expansion <b>draft</b> and <b>the</b> other for <b>the</b> amateur <b>draft.</b> <b>The</b> two general managers, Cliff Fletcher for the Flames and Bill Torrey for the Islanders, agreed to have a single coin toss for first overall in <b>the</b> amateur <b>draft.</b> <b>The</b> winner would pick first in <b>the</b> amateur <b>draft</b> and <b>the</b> first choice of skaters in <b>the</b> expansion <b>draft.</b> <b>The</b> loser would have first choice of goaltenders and first choice in <b>the</b> inter-league <b>draft</b> (<b>drafting</b> minor-league professionals). <b>The</b> Islanders won the toss to select first in <b>the</b> amateur <b>draft</b> leaving <b>the</b> Flames to pick first in <b>the</b> expansion <b>draft.</b>|$|R

5|$|Edward II succeeded as king of England on 7 July 1307, on {{the death}} of his father Edward I. The {{expectations}} of the new king were high, and he initially enjoyed a good relationship with the leading magnates of the realm. There were, however, some issues of contention remaining from the reign of his father. Edward I's incessant wars had put a great fiscal burden on the country, and his confrontational style had led to conflict with some of the leading lay and ecclesiastical lords. This had culminated in <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> of the so-called Remonstrances in 1297, a set of complaints about royal government. By Edward I's death in 1307, most of these issued had been resolved. It was nevertheless in the interest of the leading men of the country to make sure that the new king did not act the way his father had, and ignored the opinions of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|Favre {{was drafted}} by the Atlanta Falcons {{in the second round}} with the 33rd overall pick in the 1991 NFL Draft. On July 19, 1991, Favre agreed to a three-year, US$1.4million {{contract}} with a reported signing bonus of $350,000. Atlanta head coach Jerry Glanville did not approve of <b>the</b> <b>drafting</b> of Favre, saying it would take a plane crash for him to put Favre into the game. Favre's first pass in an NFL regular season game resulted in an interception returned for a touchdown in a game against the Washington Redskins. He only attempted four passes in his career at Atlanta, was intercepted twice, and completed none of them. Favre took one other snap, which resulted in a sack for an eleven-yard loss.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Garran {{worked with}} Professor Harrison Moore of the University of Melbourne and South Australian judge Professor Jethro Brown on a report about {{proposed}} constitutional amendments which ultimately became the referendum questions put {{forward in the}} 1919 referendum. Garran had been made a Knight Bachelor in 1917 and was appointed as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1920. Garran attended two Imperial Conferences, accompanying Prime Minister Stanley Bruce in 1923 and in 1930 joining Prime Minister James Scullin and Attorney-General Frank Brennan, chair of <b>the</b> <b>Drafting</b> Committee which prepared drafts of agreements on various topics, such as merchant shipping. He also attended the eleventh League of Nations conference that year with them in Geneva, Switzerland. At the Royal Commission on the Constitution in 1927, Garran was invited to give evidence by Prime Minister Bruce, where he discussed the history and origins of the Constitution {{and the evolution of}} the institutions established under it.|$|E
5000|$|Women's {{rights activists}} opposed <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> {{constitution}} on <b>the</b> {{grounds that the}} exclusion of explicit women's rights in <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> constitution opened <b>the</b> door to changes in women's rights. The People's Representatives Coalition opposed <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> constitution, launching an awareness campaign entitled [...] "Reject your constitution". The Salafi Jihadi Movement boycotted <b>the</b> <b>draft</b> constitution because it [...] "does not apply Islamic Sharia".
