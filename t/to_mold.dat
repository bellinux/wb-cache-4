5|$|Haylage, {{also known}} as Round bale silage is a term for grass sealed in {{airtight}} plastic bags, a form of forage that is frequently fed in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, but is not often seen in the United States. Because haylage {{is a type of}} silage, hay stored in this fashion must remain completely sealed in plastic, as any holes or tears can stop the preservation properties of fermentation and lead <b>to</b> <b>mold</b> or spoilage. Rodents chewing through the plastic can also spoil the hay introducing contamination to the bale. If a rodent dies inside the plastic, the subsequent botulism toxins released can contaminate the entire bale.|$|E
5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} makes it difficult <b>to</b> <b>mold.</b> Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes {{do the same with}} trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; polyvinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the health consequences {{for children of}} indoor exposure <b>to</b> <b>molds,</b> an international workshop was organized with 15 scientists from eight countries. The participants agreed that exposure <b>to</b> <b>molds</b> may constitute a health threat to children resulting in respiratory symptoms in both {{the upper and lower}} airways, an increased incidence of infections, and skin symptoms. Allergy, either <b>to</b> <b>molds</b> or <b>to</b> other indoor agents, also presents a health risk. At very high exposure levels <b>to</b> specific <b>molds,</b> nose bleeding, hemoptysis, and pulmonary hemorrhage have been documented. Pediatricians and allergists need to obtain information about mold and dampness in the home environment when examining children with chronic respiratory symptoms, recurrent infections, or persistent fatigue and headache.

40|$|SUMMARY Although the {{relationship}} between asthma severity and exposure to airborne fungi has been well studied, {{little is known about}} the contribution of outdoor <b>molds</b> <b>to</b> the symptoms of children monosensitized <b>to</b> <b>molds.</b> In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of outdoor mold spore concentrations on daily asthma and/or rhinitis scores in children monosensitized <b>to</b> <b>molds.</b> Nineteen children with asthma and/or rhinitis sensitized only <b>to</b> <b>molds</b> recorded their daily symptoms and PEF values to the diaries, from February 2005 to January 2006. Additionally, mold spores were measured daily using a Burkard 7 -day recording volumetric spore trap in city atmosphere and compared with meteorological data. Total number of mold spores in atmosphere was found to be 352, 867 spore/m 3 during the study period. Cladosporium (53 %) was the most common encountered outdoor fungi, followed by Alternaria (29 %) and 1 -septate Ascospore (3 %). Outdoor fungi concentrations were significantly correlated with mean monthly rhinitis score (r = 0. 877, p < 0. 001) and mean monthly asthma score (r = 0. 831, p = 0. 001), and mean monthly morning PEF (r =- 0. 741, p = 0. 006) and evening PEF (r =- 0. 720, p = 0. 008), and climatic conditions.

5|$|Lettuce also {{suffers from}} several viral diseases, {{including}} big vein, which causes yellow, distorted leaves, and mosaic virus, which is spread by aphids and causes stunted plant growth and deformed leaves. Aster yellows are a disease-causing bacteria carried by leafhoppers, which causes deformed leaves. Fungal diseases include powdery mildew and downy mildew, which cause leaves <b>to</b> <b>mold</b> and die and bottom rot, lettuce drop and gray mold, which cause entire plants to rot and collapse. Crowding lettuce tends to attract pests and diseases. Weeds {{can also be}} an issue, as cultivated lettuce is generally not competitive with them, especially when directly seeded into the ground. Transplanted lettuce (started in flats and later moved to growing beds) is generally more competitive initially, but can still be crowded later in the season, causing misshapen lettuce and lower yields. Weeds also act as homes for insects and disease and can make harvesting more difficult. Herbicides are often used to control weeds in commercial production. However, {{this has led to}} the development of herbicide-resistant weeds and prompted environmental and health concerns.|$|E

The documents reveal the Nazis are relying on reverse-engineered technology derived from an ancient organization known as Da'at Yichud, which created such inventions as energy weapons, computer AI's, and super concrete; however, it is also revealed that someone is tampering with the super concrete's formula, making it susceptible <b>to</b> <b>mold</b> deterioration. The Resistance discover a match with Da'at Yichud member Set Roth (Mark Ivanir), who is imprisoned in a forced labor camp. Blazkowicz agrees to go undercover inside the camp and meets Set, who tells him that the Nazis have been using technology made by him and other Jewish scientists to mass-produce and control robots, and offers to help the Resistance in return for the destruction of the labor camp. Blazkowicz finds a battery for a device that controls the camp robots, which he and Set then use to destroy the camp and rescue prisoners.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} the present study was <b>to</b> compare <b>mold</b> {{specific}} IgE results with skin test and exposure data, as well as in relation to asthma and other allergic manifestations. Methods: We performed skin prick tests (SPT) <b>to</b> 13 <b>molds</b> in 341 children from six schools and studied the microbial status of all school buildings. Subsequently, mold specific IgE was measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) <b>to</b> 10 <b>molds</b> in 31 of those children with a positive (≥ 3 mm) or weak SPT reaction (1 – 2 mm) and in 62 age- and sex-matched controls with no such reactions. Results: Mold-specific IgE was elevated by EIA (> 0. 35 lU/mL) to at least one of the 10 studied species in 12 children (39 %) with and in two children (3 %) without skin test reactions. The calculated prevalence of elevated mold-specific IgE was 5 % in the non-selected and 10 % in children selected by respiratory morbidity. Six children had IgE <b>to</b> the dampness-indicative <b>mold</b> Aspergillus fumigatus, five children had IgE to the common outdoor mold Cladosporium herbarum and four children had IgE to the uncommon, but highly allergenic, indoor mold Rhizopus nigricans. All 14 children who had elevated IgE <b>to</b> <b>molds</b> were boys, 13 had atopy by skin tests and 12 had either asthma or had wheezed. However, no species-specific association was found between IgE or SPT responses and exposure <b>to</b> <b>molds.</b> Conclusions: Mold allergy, as assessed by IgE measurements or skin tests, is rare in children. School- aged asthmatic boys having exposed to indoor air dampness seem to form a susceptible group for mold allergy, being at risk for worsening of their asthma...|$|R
