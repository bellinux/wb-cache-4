40|$|Combination {{vaccines}} {{have become}} the preferred choice for immunizing children in high- and middle-income countries. However, these new vaccines are prohibitively expensive for low-income countries, causing them to rely on older, less-expensive vaccines. This product divergence decreases economies of scale for <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccines</b> and eliminates the financial incentive for manufacturers to maintain production of less-expensive vaccines or even to develop new vaccines for diseases affecting developing countries. This paper treats combination vaccines as bundles of antigens that can be priced as a single item. Such bundles are used to formulate an optimization problem that determines the combination vaccine allocation between vaccine producers and different countries under a price discrimination agreement. The objective of the optimization problem is to satisfy countries' antigen demand at the lowest possible price, while providing a reasonable profit for the vaccine producers. The optimization problem results in a mixed-integer non-linear programming model that maximizes the sum of manufacturing profits and the customer surplus, and hence, it maximizes the total social surplus. Moreover, a constructive heuristic is proposed to determine an approximation to the best allocation of combination vaccines and their range of feasible prices. Computational results show that vaccine prices in all market segments become more affordable as the supply {{of the most complex}} combination vaccines becomes more available to low-income countries.

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} costs of {{vaccination}} regimens for introducing inactivated polio vaccine in routine immunization in Brazil. METHODS A cost analysis was conducted for vaccines in five vaccination regimens, including inactivated polio vaccine, compared with the oral polio vaccine-only regimen. The costs of the vaccines were estimated for routine use and for the &# 8220;National Immunization Days&# 8221;, during when the oral polio vaccine is administered to children aged less than five years, independent of their vaccine status, and the strategic stock of inactivated polio vaccine. The presented estimated costs are of 2011. RESULTS The annual costs of the oral vaccine-only program (routine and two National Immunization Days) were estimated at US$ 19, 873, 170. The incremental costs of inclusion of the inactivated vaccine depended {{on the number of}} vaccine doses, presentation of the vaccine (bottles with single dose or ten doses), and number of &# 8220;National Immunization Days&# 8221; carried out. The cost of the regimen adopted with two doses of inactivated vaccine followed by three doses of oral vaccine and one &# 8220;National Immunization Day&# 8221; was estimated at US$ 29, 653, 539. The concomitant replacement of the DTPw/Hib and HepB vaccines with the pentavalent vaccine enabled the introduction of the inactivated polio without increasing the number of injections or number of visits needed to complete the vaccination. CONCLUSIONS The introduction of the inactivated vaccine increased the annual costs of the polio vaccines by 49. 2 % compared with the oral vaccine-only regimen. This increase represented 1. 13 % of the expenditure of the National Immunization Program on <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccines</b> in 2011...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRotavirus (RV) is {{the leading}} cause of severe {{gastroenteritis}} (GE) among infants and young children worldwide, accounting for 453, 000 deaths in children aged < 5 years. In Latin America rotavirus causes an estimated 15, 000 deaths annually and accounts for 20 – 70 % of acute gastroenteritis cases requiring hospitalization. This results in an estimated annual cost of approximately US$ 86 million. The most common G type has been G 1 (∼ 50 %), followed by G 4, G 3 and G 9, although regional and temporal variations are significant. There are currently two effective rotavirus vaccines: a single-strain, human attenuated-based (RotarixTM, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), and a five-strain, bovine-human reassortant vaccine (RotaTeqTM, Merck and Company). The pioneering strategy behind the development and licensure of RotarixTM was part of a new paradigm for global vaccine research and development focusing on introduction first in countries with greatest medical needs. Rotarix™ demonstrated high efficacy and a good safety profile in Phase II and III clinical trials performed in Latin America. In the pivotal phase III study involving 11 Latin American countries a 2 -year efficacy of 81 % (95 % CI: 71 – 87) was achieved against severe rotavirus acute gastroenteritis. A high protective efficacy was observed against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by G 1 and non-G 1 strains. RotarixTM proved to be safe regarding intussusception (IS) in a two-dose vaccine schedule beginning at 6 – 12 weeks of age. First registered in Mexico in July 2004, Rotarix™ gained World Health Organization (WHO) prequalification in February 2007 and has been introduced for routine use into the universal mass vaccination programs of Brazil, Panama, Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, and El Salvador. The main factors influencing the decision-making process of introducing rotavirus vaccines in Latin American countries included: (a) demonstration of good efficacy/safety profiles; (b) political decision to decrease mortality; (c) decision from ministries of health; (d) availability of data on the disease burden; (e) cold chain available; and, importantly (f) the use of PAHO's Revolving Fund for <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Post-licensure studies have shown 76 % (95 % CI: 64 – 84 %) effectiveness in El Salvadoran children and 76 % (95 % CI: 58 – 86 %) to 85 % (95 % CI: 53 – 94 %) in Brazil. Observational studies in Panama, Mexico, El Salvador and Brazil reported reduction in all-cause diarrhea-related hospitalizations at rates of 22 – 37 %, 11 – 40 %, 35 – 48 %, and 17 – 48 %, respectively. The decline in diarrhea-associated deaths reached 35 % (95 % CI: 29 – 39 %) in Mexico and ranged from 22 % (95 % CI: 6 – 45 %) to 33 % (95 % CI: 15 – 52 %) among Brazilian children. A low, increased risk of intussusception was detected among Mexican infants within 7 days after first vaccine dose [odds ratio, 5. 8 (95 % CI: 2. 6 – 13) ]. Continuous and expanding post-licensure rotavirus surveillance studies are needed to better assess the effect of universal vaccination in Latin American countries and elsewhere...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This report {{presents}} {{an approach to}} costing the delivery <b>of</b> a malaria <b>vaccine</b> through the {{expanded program on immunization}} (EPI), and presents the predicted cost per dose delivered and cost per fully immunized child (FIC) in Tanzania, which are key inputs to the cost-effectiveness analysis. The costs included in the analysis are those related to <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vaccine</b> taking into account the wastage rate; the costs of distributing and storing the vaccine at central, zonal, district, and facility level; those of managing the vaccination program; the costs of delivery at facility level (including personnel, syringes, safety boxes, and waste management); and those of additional training of EPI personnel and of social mobilization activities. The average cost per FIC increases almost linearly from US$ 4. 2 per FIC at a <b>vaccine</b> price <b>of</b> US$ 1 per dose to US$ 31. 2 at <b>vaccine</b> price <b>of</b> US$ 10 per dose. The marginal cost is approximately 5 % less than the average cost.

They consider a hypothetical vaccine costing ten dollars to produce, and offering sixty percent, seventy five percent, and ninety percent reductions {{in the risk of}} HIV for ten years. For each of the world's ten major geographic divisions, they sue published estimates of the risk of AIDS, the value of medical costs averted, and the value of potential productivity losses. Under the"health sector"algorithm - in which purchases are made to minimize the impact of AIDS/HIV on government health spending - 766 million courses <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> would be <b>purchased.</b> Under the"societal"algorithm - in which purchases are made to minimize the impact of AIDS/HIV on health spending and GDP - more than 3. 7 billion courses <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> would be <b>purchased.</b> Under an"equity"model - allocating vaccines to everyone in the world at high risk, as if they had the financial resources of Western Europeans - vaccine would be offered to 4. 7 billion people. For a Western European man, reducing the risk of AIDS/HIV would be a $ 789 concern; in Africa,the comparable risk would be a $ 48, 577 crisis. The authors conclude that financing AIDS vaccines solely on the fixed budget of a ministry of health, means large vulnerable populations wouldn't receive the vaccine. Allocating the vaccine based on society's ability to pay would still exclude many poor infants who would probably be immunized if they were born in more developed regions.

40|$|Early in 2003, fresh {{outbreaks}} of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) were declared in Botswana and Mozambique. With annual exports of beef to the European Union worth between t 100 million and t 200 million, Botswana took immediate action: trade was suspended, {{the area in}} question was closed off and 4, 000 head of cattle were slaughtered. Similar measures had been taken in 2002. What is striking is that both countries, as well as nearby Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, have for decades had vast areas free of FMD. They are all allowed to export boned meat to the EU at low customs duties, under the ACP-EC Cotonou Agreement. Some fear, however, that the EU, which is the principal export market for meat from southern Africa, will {{go as far as}} forbidding all meat imports from the region: it is animal diseases, more than customs duties and quotas, which are now the major obstacle to international trade in animal products. Of late, attention has turned to Zimbabwe, where FMD has been declared virtually every year since 1996. The country s economy is going through a difficult period and lacks hard currency for essential imports; nor has it received any of the aid it requested for <b>the</b> <b>purchase</b> <b>of</b> animal <b>vaccines.</b> With <b>the</b> help of Zimbabwe s weak currency, meat smuggling is now rife and has spread the diseases into neighbouring countries. A study by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) commissioned by the British government has concluded that the abandonment of FMD control measures {{will turn out to be}} a costly mistake for Zimbabwe (official exports were reported down by 80 % in mid-May) and the entire region, whereas they had much to gain from strengthening them. But here s the rub: the costs of the measures are borne by the producer community, whereas the benefits go more to the commercial processing sector than to the poor. No wonder that the report exhorts the private sector to invest in control measures.

40|$|Vaccination {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and successful public health endeavors in human history, profoundly reducing mortalities caused by infectious diseases. In the United States, the comprehensive success of large scale pediatric immunization programs results from the collaboration of an interdependent system of government and industry stakeholders. A stakeholder in this system acts independently in pursuit of its own interests; yet, the actions of one stakeholder may profoundly affect the welfare of another stakeholder. It is imperative that these stakeholders understand the nature of their interdependence and the holistic impact of their behavior on the entire vaccine market. The market for pediatric vaccines is fragile and requires ongoing vigilance to meet public health goals regarding immunization coverage rates. Of particular concern is the economic competition within the vaccine industry, the impact of government regulatory policies on the vaccine industry, and the attendant impact on the vaccine system's ability to ensure the adequate provision <b>of</b> <b>vaccines.</b> This dissertation applies operations research and game theoretic methods to aid public health policy practitioners in making more informed decisions regarding <b>the</b> <b>purchasing</b> and pricing <b>of</b> <b>vaccines</b> in the public sector of the United States pediatric vaccine market. The market is analyzed from three different perspectives. First, an operations research approach is proposed for analyzing a pharmaceutical firm's pricing strategy for a single combination vaccine. A vaccine price is sought that maximizes a firm's expected revenue. Next, a game theoretic approach enables formulation of a static Bertrand pricing model that characterizes oligopolistic interaction between all of the firms in a multiple homogeneous product market. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a price equilibrium are provided. Finally, a monopsonistic buyer's vaccine formulary pricing and purchasing problem is formulated. Using a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) model, a pricing and purchasing policy for government health care policy practitioners can be designed that establishes a sustainable and stable capital investment environment in which the reliable provision <b>of</b> the pediatric <b>vaccines</b> so essential to public health can occur...|$|R
