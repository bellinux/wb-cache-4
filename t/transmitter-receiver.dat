25|$|Once on His {{visit to}} the Panchavati Hills near Shirali, the weather became very cyclonic. He noticed 2 {{fishermen}} trying to battle the cyclonic conditions in the Arabian Sea but they failed after their boat capsized and they drowned. This incident deeply hurt Swamiji as He was helpless and could not help the fishermen. Thus came the idea of starting a wireless station at Pachavati {{that could be used}} for communication in times of emergency. A Wireless <b>transmitter-receiver</b> station was established with the help of people like Badakere Dutt, Kallianpur Ramanand etc. An Observatory post was also established which was manned all throughout the day and night, to guide ships and boats through the jagged rocks that adorn the coastline of Shirali, especially at night. Swamiji also studied and obtained a first grade amateur radio license within a period of 3 months of applying for it, a task that is difficult by normal standards. He was probably the first sanyasi to obtain such a license. He was also an active user of the amateur radio.|$|E
25|$|A {{wireless}} network consists of nodes (each {{of which is}} a transmitter, receiver or both, depending on the system) that produce, relay or consume data within the network. For example, base stations and users in a cellular phone network or sensor nodes in a sensor network. Before developing stochastic geometry wireless models, models are required for mathematically representing the signal propagation and the node positioning. The propagation model captures how signals propagate from transmitters to receivers. The node location or positioning model (idealizes and) represents the positions of the nodes as a point process. The choice of these models depends {{on the nature of the}} {{wireless network}} and its environment. The network type depends on such factors as the specific architecture (for instance cellular) and the channel or medium access control (MAC) protocol, which controls the channels and, hence, the communicating structures of the network. In particular, to prevent the collision of transmissions in the network, the MAC protocol dictates, based on certain rules, when <b>transmitter-receiver</b> pairs can access the network both in time and space, which also affects the active node positioning model.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{applications}} of the RF power amplifier include driving to another high power source, driving a transmitting antenna and exciting microwave cavity resonators. Among these applications, driving transmitter antennas is most well known. The <b>transmitter-receivers</b> are used not only for voice and data communication but also for weather sensing (in {{the form of a}} radar).|$|R
2500|$|The post-1958 Pirinçlik {{system had}} eight {{separate}} radar sets or channels, {{each with its}} own , transmitter, duplexer, receiver, and data display unit. These eight channels fed electromagnetic energy into sixteen fixed beams formed by the two antennas, each channel, or <b>transmitter-receiver</b> combination, being time-shared between two beams. Pneumatically driven switches operated on a three-second cycle to power each beam alternately for 1.5 seconds. There were antenna feeds for two additional beams which could be made to function with some patchwork in the wiring.|$|E
2500|$|In wired communication, {{the field}} of {{information}} theory (in particular, the Shannon-Hartley theorem) motivates the need for studying the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In a wireless communication, when a collection of channels is active at the same time, the interference from the other channels is considered as noise, which [...] motivates {{the need for the}} quantity known as the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). For example, if we have a collection of point-to-point channels, the SINR of the channel of a particular <b>transmitter–receiver</b> pair is defined as: ...|$|E
2500|$|Poisson bipolar {{network model}} {{is a type of}} {{stochastic}} geometry model based on the Poisson process and is an early example of a model for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), [...] which [...] are a self-organizing wireless communication network in which mobile devices rely on no infrastructure (base stations or access points). In MANET models, the transmitters form a random point process and each transmitter has its receiver located at some random distance and orientation. The channels form a collection of <b>transmitter-receiver</b> pairs or [...] "bipoles"; the signal of a channel is that transmitted over the associated bipole, whereas the interference is that created by all other transmitters than that of the bipole. The approach of considering the transmitters-receive bipoles led to the development and analysis of one of the Poisson bipolar network model. The choice of the medium access probability, which maximizes the mean number of successful transmissions per unit space, was in particular derived in.|$|E

40|$|Measuring systems {{based on}} a pair of optical fiber <b>transmitter-receivers</b> are used in medium-voltage testing {{laboratories}} wherein the environment of high electromagnetic interference (EMI) is a limitation for using conventional cabling. Nonlinear compensation techniques have been used to limit the voltage range at the input of optical fiber links. However, nonlinear compensation introduces gain and linearity errors caused by thermal drift. This paper presents a method of thermal compensation for the nonlinear circuit used to improve transient signal handling capabilities in measuring system while maintaining low errors in gain and linearity caused by thermal drift...|$|R
2500|$|In the {{previous}} MAC-based models, point-to-point channels were assumed and the interference was considered as noise. In recent years, {{models have been}} developed to study more elaborate channels arising from the discipline of network information theory. More specifically, a model was developed for one of the simplest settings: a collection of <b>transmitter-receiver</b> pairs represented as a Poisson point process. In this model, the effects of an interference reduction scheme involving [...] "point-to-point codes" [...] were examined. These codes, consisting of randomly and independently generated codewords, give transmitters-receivers permission when to exchange information, thus acting as a MAC protocol. Furthermore, in this model a collection or [...] "party" [...] of channels was defined for each such pair. This party is a multiple access channel, namely the many-to-one situation for channels. The receiver of the party is {{the same as that of}} the pair, and the transmitter of the pair belongs to the set of transmitters of the party, together with other transmitters. Using stochastic geometry, the probability of coverage was derived as well as the geometric properties of the coverage cells. It was also shown [...] that when using the point-to-point codes and simultaneous decoding, the statistical gain obtained over a Poisson configuration is arbitrarily large compared to the scenario where interference is treated as noise.|$|E

25|$|The first American {{demonstration}} of Meucci's invention {{took place in}} Staten Island, New York in 1854. In 1860, a description of it was reportedly published in an Italian-language New York newspaper, although no known copy of that newspaper issue or article has survived to the present day. Meucci claimed to have invented a paired electromagnetic transmitter and receiver, where the motion of a diaphragm modulated a signal in a coil by moving an electromagnet, although this was not mentioned in his 1871 U.S. patent caveat. A further discrepancy observed was that the device described in the 1871 caveat employed only a single conduction wire, with the telephone's <b>transmitter-receivers</b> being insulated from a 'ground return' path.|$|R

The {{amount of power}} consumed by the memory device {{is an important factor}} when transmitting and processing a high volume of data such as images. Therefore, many studies have been conducted to reduce power consumption by decreasing the size of image data with simple compression method before transmission to use computing processes and memory as small as possible [6 – 8]. Accordingly, low-memory compression methods have been adopted in mobile devices, especially in those that require high-power consumption and bandwidth for high-resolution display [9] and in vehicle safety systems that require very low delays for real-time image transmission [10].|$|R
30|$|In both days, the {{position}} of the GasFinder laser unit was sequentially moved (e.g., from positions A to E in Figs.  2 and 3) to scan the fumaroles’ atmospheric plumes from different angles and viewing directions. The positions of <b>transmitter-receivers</b> were limited by time-logistic constraints (e.g., morphology and accessibility of the degassing areas); given the geometry of the optical paths, we admit some heterogeneities in our CO 2 maps (Figs.  4 and 5) may result from inhomogeneous, incomplete coverage of the degassing areas. During operations, the GasFinder was left to acquire data along each single GasFinder-retroreflector path for ~ 3 – 5  min, before being rotated to measure along the successive path (an additional documentation file shows more details of acquisition-paths (see A 1 in Additional file 1).|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} use of phased arrays for transmitting and receiving antennae presents an opportunity to develop and use instruments that allow sampling of a true 3 -D volume, for studying the planetary boundary layer. By combining a phase array with independent control of each element, with mutlifrequency techniques and {{with the use of}} multiple <b>transmitter-receivers,</b> we are developing an instrument that can accomplish this task on a relatively small scale. Because this instrument is an acoustic device, hardware and software control device costs are modest. In its initial configuration, it has three high-frequency 36 -element phased-array antennae with individual control over each of the array elements. A single antenna is being constructed for proof of concept and design changes.

50|$|The Radio Branch or Wireless Workshops pioneered many {{techniques}} {{in the use}} of radio by the police. In 1925 they had radio communications between constabulary headquarters in Preston and six divisional headquarters. A year later a van was equipped with a transmitter. Tests were done with radio communication to cars in the 1930s. In 1939 four fixed stations provided coverage over much of the county. At the start of World War II divisional headquarters were equipped with <b>transmitter-receivers</b> as a back-up to the telephone system. This was used in 1941 when the telephone system in Liverpool was put out of action by bombing, Lancashire Constabulary's radio system was sole means of communications with the city for a time. After the war they were involved in the development and move to VHF FM by the UK police. In 1961 a personal radio scheme was installed in Chorley with Motorola VHF personal radios imported from the USA after a demonstration in Stretford in 1959. This led in 1963 to the design of the Lancon VHF personal radio manufactured by GEC.|$|R

40|$|International audienceFor most of {{the twentieth}} century, historians of physics {{situated}} {{the discovery of the}} theory of relativity {{at the cutting edge of}} contemporary experimental and theoretical physics: ether-drag experiments, electron theory, and the electrodynamics of moving bodies. Following the practical turn in HST, Peter Galison suggested that to better understand the relativity revolution we should review its embedding in turn-of-the-century material cultures of clock coordination and telegraph networks. The co-founders of relativity, Henri Poincaré and Albert Einstein were both engaged with these iconically-modern technologies, at the Paris Bureau of Longitudes, and the Bern Patent Office, respectively. Galison's technology-driven account of the theory of relativity can be extended by taking into consideration Poincaré's contributions to wireless telegraphy, including his studies of the diffraction of wireless waves (1903 - 1912), and a 1908 lecture series on the stability of current oscillations in the singing-arc radio transmitter. Just a few months after the latter lecture series in Paris, Poincaré delivered another series in Göttingen, financed by the Wolfskehl Foundation. During his talk on the new mechanics issuing from the Lorentz group, Poincaré proposed a thought experiment that corrected his earlier, physically-untenable interpretation of the Lorentz group, ostensibly to accommodate observers in inertial motion with respect to the ether, whom he equipped with timekeepers and radio <b>transmitter-receivers.</b> Poincaré's new radio-based understanding of the physical significance of the Lorentz transformations was closer to the relativity theories of Einstein and Minkowski, while it retained a traditional role for the ether as the seat of radio wave propagation...|$|R
