They had expected <b>tailwinds</b> <b>from</b> the jet stream, yet could complete the distance without them, but headwinds meant that Washington might be too far. At 7am Eastern War Time, aircraft Number 2 was over Northway, Alaska, and navigator Bill Townes determined that they were behind schedule. He said later, [...] "When I reported that fact to General LeMay, {{he looked at me}} as if he thought it was my fault, so I retreated behind my bulkhead to check my figures." [...] Later, the airmen learned that the typhoon near Okinawa the week before had greatly affected the jet stream.|$|R
50|$|The Pro Cologne Citizen's Movement (Bürgerbewegung pro Köln) {{was formed}} in 1996 as an {{offshoot}} of the extreme right-wing German League for People and Homeland. The far-right publisher Manfred Rouhs and the lawyer Markus Beisicht have been active in the association from its start. In the 1999 mayoral election, the party presented Stephan Flug as its candidate who won 0.3% of the votes. When the municipality planned to erect a mosque in Cologne's Chorweiler district, the citizen's movement organised a collection of signatures petitioning against the project. They were able to present 28,000 signatures against any mosque construction site in Cologne to the committee on petitions only shortly before the 2004 local elections. With the <b>tailwinds</b> <b>from</b> the signatures campaign, the voter's association was able to win 4.7% of the votes and four seats in the Cologne city council. In 2005, a fifth councillor joined Pro Cologne's group. The electoral success initiated the expansion of the party to the state and federal level.|$|R

40|$|The silver Y moth Autographa gamma {{undertakes}} windborne {{spring and}} fall migrations between winter breeding regions around the Mediterranean and summer breeding regions in northern Europe. Flight behaviors facilitating these migrations include: (i) selection of seasonally-favorable tailwinds; (ii) flying at the altitude of the fastest winds; (iii) adopting flight headings that partially counteract crosswind drift; and (iv) seasonal reversal of preferred directions between {{spring and fall}}. In the UK, radar measurements indicate that migratory activity is pronounced during the spring and fall, but is usually very low during midsummer (July). However, an atypically intense period of high-altitude flight was recorded during July 2006, and {{in this study we}} compare the flight behavior of A. gamma during these midsummer movements with the more typical spring and fall migrations. During July 2006, activity was most intense at significantly lower altitudes than occurred in spring or fall, and was not associated with the height of the fastest winds; consequently displacement speeds were significantly slower. The most striking difference was an absence of tailwind selectivity in July with windborne movements occurring on almost every night of the month and on <b>tailwinds</b> <b>from</b> all directions. Finally, orientation behavior was quantitatively different during July, with significantly greater dispersion of flight headings and displacements than observed in spring and fall. We discuss mechanisms which could have caused these differences, and conclude that a lack of appropriate photoperiod cues during development of the summer generation resulted in randomly-oriented ‘dispersive’ movements that were strikingly different from typical seasonal migrations [Current Zoology 59 (3) : 360 – 370, 2013]...|$|R

While the authority is {{looking for ways to}} resolve the issue, the authority is also looking for scheduled air services provided by another service provider which would use the opposite direction of the runway that would not have severe wind shear problem but would instead suffer <b>from</b> <b>tailwind.</b>|$|R
50|$|Honduran {{authorities}} delegated {{the investigation}} of the accident to the Civil Aviation Authority of El Salvador as per the Convention on International Civil Aviation. The accident report stated that the airplane had landed with a 12-knot <b>tailwind,</b> 400 meters <b>from</b> the displaced approach end of the runway. Since this was the first intermediate stop on a long transcontinental flight, the aircraft was near its upper landing-weight limit (63.5t vs. 64.5t maximum allowable). In addition, the runway was wet, due to the passage of Tropical Storm Alma.|$|R
40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] China's new {{strategy}} to upgrade its semiconductor industry (outlined in the "Guidelines to Promote National Integrated Circuit Industry Development," June 24, 2014), seeks to move from catching-up to forging ahead in semiconductors, by strengthening simultaneously China's integrated circuit (IC) design industry and domestic IC foundry services. This study explores how China's new semiconductor strategy seeks to benefit from four global transformations in semiconductor markets and technology: a) the demand pull from mobile devices; b) new opportunities for China's foundries in trailing-node semiconductor technologies; c) changes in the IC foundry industry landscape; and d) a new interest in strategic partnerships and mergers and acquisitions (M&A). A second contribution {{of the study is}} to examine two Policy Initiatives of the new strategy: (a) the IC Industry Support Small Leading Group to enhance strategy coordination; and (b) IC Industry Equity Investment Funds to improve investment allocation, and to enhance firm size and capabilities through strategic partnerships, joint ventures and mergers and acquisitions, involving both foreign firms and domestic firms. The implementation of both policies signals a genuine effort to experiment with a bottom-up, market-led approach to industrial policy. In the Leading Group for instance, experts play an active role in policy formulation and implementation who are well connected in the global semiconductor industry and who know what policies might work in this knowledge-intensive and highly globalized industry. The use of professional investment fund managers, as opposed to government subsidies or investment, signals the emergence of a hybrid model that seeks to combine the logic of equity investment fund management with the objectives of China's IC development strategy. An important, largely unresolved challenge for China's industrial upgrading scenario in semiconductors is the possible impact on exports of China's electronics final products. The study concludes that, despite movements in the right direction, the new Semiconductor Strategy's capacity for flexible policy adjustments remains limited, and that multi-layered industrial dialogues among key stakeholders in the industry are still at an early stage. To exploit the <b>tailwinds</b> <b>from</b> the market, China needs to experiment further with new more market-driven approaches to industrial policy...|$|R
40|$|Title: Physiological {{response}} of competitors Fireball dinghy {{class in the}} model sailing race. Objectives: The main intention of the thesis is to detect the physical demands (difficulties) of sailing boat race categorized as Fireball double crew. The variables of physiological response to the load of competitors recorded are being measured using simulated race under laboratory conditions. At that point, this opportunity enabled us to carry out further comparisons and examine the physical demands of individual post at various directions of wind. Methods: The entire investigation of detecting physiological functions of competitors {{will be carried out}} noninvasively throughout the simulation of sailing using metabolic analyser tool and sport tester. From the feedback, we will obtained figures and originate the physiological {{response of}} human body to the load. Due to the investigation is being implemented on the double crew boat Fireball; both competitors (crew/helmsman) performing different tasks will be simulated and examined individually. Simulated race will last 24 minutes and competitors will have to face different wind courses, precisely cruising upwind, crosswind and <b>tailwind.</b> Results: <b>From</b> the measured results, we can state that most of the time during simulated race, the performance of racers [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Most seabirds breed colonially, {{at which}} time they make central-place {{foraging}} trips. Parents must collect food both for themselves and for egg production/chick-rearing. How should they forage? I followed five species across two sites in Sweden in the Baltic Sea using GPS and time-depth recorder (TDR) devices, giving information on both flight and diving activity. I use a movement ecology approach, asking questions about which spatiotemporal aspects determine these species’ movement activities and on how species differ in their foraging activity. Further, I test theories of how birds should optimally vary their flight behaviour in response to winds, and of how individual birds collect information on alternative breeding sites, i. e. prospecting. Chick-rearing Common Murre (Uria aalge) from the island of Stora Karlsö (SK; 17. 97 °E, 57. 29 °N), foraged most around sunset and sunrise, when they made more frequent and shallower dives compared to at midday. They made longer distance and duration overnight trips where they visited more distant foraging areas than during daytime trips. In a following study I showed that the GPS device deployed had little measurable effect on the Common Murre’s activity, though murres did lose body mass which remains to be explained. During flights returning from foraging sites to their colony at Stora Karlsö, both Common Murre and Lesser Black-backed Gull (Larus fuscus) optimally adjust their airspeeds to minimise their costs of transport, increasing airspeed under headwinds and cross-winds, but reducing airspeed under tailwinds. While the gulls also adjusted their altitude, increasing altitude under <b>tailwinds,</b> thus benefiting <b>from</b> the faster winds higher up, but flying low, where wind is slower, under headwinds and crosswinds; the murres though always fly low, close to the sea surface. Lesser Black-backed Gull are generalist foragers, at Stora Karlsö they feed both on land and at sea. How do they choose between these? Lesser Black-backed Gull were followed with GPS and observations were made at arable fields on nearby Gotland. The gulls foraged most on land early in the breeding season, and during early mornings especially on cool and cloudy days, while they foraged mostly at sea later in the season, {{and later in the}} day. They foraged most on fields with short vegetation and low ground-cover, presumably where soil living invertebrates and earthworms are more available. Following four Larus gull species with GPS during the peak breeding period at the Björn Archipelago at Fågelsundet (FS; 17. 72 °E, 60. 63 °N), I show using an information reduction and clustering method how different gull species overlap in the types of foraging trip they use, while also using distinct types of foraging trip. Some species used just a couple of types of trip (specialist), while others used several types quite equally (generalists), this variation was also present within species when comparing between individuals. Lesser Black-backed Gull from both Stora Karlsö and Fågelsundet, followed with GPS, made very long-distance return movements away from their colonies, mostly after failed breeding attempts. On the majority of these movements, gulls visited multiple coastal sites, likely prospecting at alternative breeding colonies. The gulls from Fågelsundet travelled furthest, visiting many of the same coastal sites as the Stora Karlsö gulls with no difference between sexes...|$|R
