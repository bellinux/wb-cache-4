40|$|Benevolent {{and mutual}} benefit societies, {{associations}} {{for the care}} of the sick and burial of the dead, fraternal lodges, literary associations, Sunday schools, orphan asylums, hospitals and Jewish cemeteries constituted an American <b>Jewish</b> <b>public</b> sphere [...] -the realm of social and civic life identified by social theorists in which participants form opinions, debate issues and rehearse identities. For many nineteenth century American Jews, participation in this sphere became the primary manifestation of their <b>Jewish</b> affiliation, replacing <b>the</b> rituals and observances of traditional Judaism. This dissertation explores <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>public</b> sphere in cities across America, from its emergence in the 1820 s through America's Centennial in 1876. There are two central arguments: First, gender was a significant organizing principle behind <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>public</b> sphere as women and men partnered in its creation and engaged in defining <b>the</b> categories of <b>Jewish</b> manhood and Jewish womanhood. Second, through their institutions, American Jews created a Jewish civil religion, whose beliefs, symbols and rituals they hoped could transcend their ideological differences and unite them as American Jews. This dissertation examines four arenas through which American Jews transformed American Judaism as they attempted to construct a unified vision of Jewish identity [...] -Jewish philanthropy, Jewish fraternal orders, Hebrew literary associations and <b>Jewish</b> cemeteries. <b>The</b> primary purposes of the associations of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>public</b> sphere included <b>the</b> maintenance and promotion of Jewish obligation, cohesion, knowledge and identity. Yet, these <b>Jewish</b> institutions adopted <b>the</b> forms, language, and even values of American civic culture and civil religion as the mechanisms through which to promote their Jewish agenda. Thus, Jewish philanthropy adapted to American gender norms and attitudes towards poverty. Jewish fraternal orders merged the American fraternal form with a newly emerging Jewish civil religion. Jewish literary associations embraced a popular American form to instill in young Jewish men a sense of duty to Judaism and to America. Finally, <b>Jewish</b> cemeteries reflected <b>the</b> continuing desire for Jewish separateness even as the manner of burial reveals an embrace of an American domestic piety. Thesis (Ph. D.)
