5|$|The Altar to Liberty: Minerva monument: The {{battle is}} commemorated with a monument, which {{includes}} a bronze statue of Minerva {{near the top of}} Battle Hill, the highest point of Brooklyn, in Green-Wood Cemetery.

The statue stands in the northwest corner of the cemetery and gazes directly at <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> Liberty in New York Harbor. In 2006, the Minerva statue was invoked in a successful defense to prevent a building from blocking the line of sight from the cemetery to <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> Liberty in the harbor. The annual Battle of Long Island commemoration begins inside the main Gothic arch entrance to Green-Wood Cemetery and marches up Battle Hill to ceremonies at the monument.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of the bad}} weather, the B-17s {{returned}} individually to Mitchel Field. Cousland's Flying Fortress encountered severe hail, damaging all {{the forward}} surfaces of the plane, and ice caused a temporary shutdown of one engine.

The next morning the three bombers took off to return to Harrisburg and spotted the Rex passing <b>the</b> <b>Statue</b> <b>of</b> Liberty at 09:30 as it entered New York Harbor.|$|E
