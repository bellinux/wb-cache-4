25|$|<b>Taro</b> (<b>Colocasia</b> esculenta): A {{popular and}} ancient plant {{that has been}} {{harvested}} for at least 30,000 years by indigenous people in New Guinea. There are hundreds of varieties of taro, and the corm of the wetland variety makes the best poi, as well as taro starch or flour. The dry-land variety has a crispy texture and used for making taro chips. The smaller American variety is used for stewed dishes.|$|R
50|$|In plants world, the lotus leaf is not {{the only}} example of natural superhydrophobic surfaces. For instance, <b>taro</b> (<b>Colocasia</b> esculenta) leaves were found to exhibit {{self-cleaning}} behavior, too. They have a binary roughness built up by averagely 10 mm elliptical protrusions in diameter and nano-sized pins. India canna (Cannageneralis bailey) leaves and the rice leaves (whatever the kind of rice) also represent superhydrophobicity, arising from the hierarchical surface morphology.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>taro</b> (<b>Colocasia</b> esculenta), {{referred}} to in the Azores as inhames or coco in Portuguese, is cultivated in many islands of the archipelago. It was first introduced onto the island of São Jorge during the 17th century, probably from southeast Asia, and became popular with the peasant class. Given its nutritional importance, taro was planted in peasant gardens to stave off food crises and famine; in periods when crops failed, the taro was used to supplant local sources of protein.|$|R

25|$|In {{recent years}} the Tuvaluan {{community}} have raised concerns over increased salinity of the groundwater in pits {{that are used to}} cultivate pulaka. Pits on all islands of Tuvalu (except Niulakita) were surveyed in 2006. Nukulaelae and Niutao each had one pit area in which salinity concentrations thought to be too high for successful swamp taro growth. However, on Fongafale in Funafuti all pits surveyed were either too saline or very marginal for swamp taro production, although a more salt tolerant species of <b>taro</b> (<b>Colocasia</b> esculenta) was being grown in Fongafale.|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{experiment with}} seven preemergence herbicides identified oxyfluorfen as a promising herbicide for commercial <b>taro</b> (<b>Colocasia</b> esculenta) production in Hawaii.

No oxyfluorfen residues {{were found in}} plant tissues (limit of detection 0. 02 ppm). Oxyfluorfen levels in water from treated lowland plots was determined.

40|$|Nineteen new {{microsatellite}} markers {{were isolated}} from <b>Taro,</b> <b>Colocasia</b> esculenta (L.), mainly distributed in Yunnan Province of China. Nineteen primer pairs were polymorphic in 20 individuals sampled from a {{population in the}} Yunnan province, China. The number of alleles per locus ranges from two to six, with the observed and expected heterozygosity levels ranging from 0. 177 to 0. 820 and from 0. 126 to 0. 742, respectively.

40|$|<b>Taro</b> <b>Colocasia</b> esculenta is {{a staple}} food in most {{countries}} of the South Pacific region.

40|$|Neste trabalho foi investigada a assepsia para obtenção de explantes oriundos de tubérculos e a ação das poliaminas espermidina e espermina exógenas associadas aos reguladores vegetais AIA e BA no desenvolvimento, na tuberização {{in vitro}} e nos níveis endógenos de putrescina (Put), espermidina (Spd) e espermina (Spm) de <b>taro</b> (<b>Colocasia</b> esculenta). Plantas crescidas em meio contendo espermidina e espermina mostraram tuberização e a associação dessas poliaminas com AIA e BA induziu aumento do número de brotações. Para o estímulo da rizogênese, não foi necessário o uso de reguladores vegetais. Altos teores de putrescina foram encontrados durante a emissão de brotações, enquanto que altos teores de espermidina foram observados durante a formação de rizomas in vitro. The present {{research}} investigated the asepsis for attainment of explants deriving of tubers and the polyamines espermidine and espermine exogenous effects {{associated with the}} plant growth regulators NAA and BA on the development and tuberization in vitro and the endogenous levels of putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm) of <b>taro</b> (<b>Colocasia</b> esculenta). Plants grown in the medium with spermidine and spermine showed tuberization and the association of these polyamines with NAA and BA increases number of shoots. Plant growth regulators were not necessary for root initiation. High levels of endogenous Put were found during the shoot emission, while high levels Spd were observed during in vitro root formation...|$|R

40|$|Production of <b>taro</b> (<b>Colocasia</b> esculenta) in American Samoa {{depends on}} {{recently}} imported cultivars resistant to taro leaf blight disease (TLB). The {{purpose of this}} study was to find a practical, inexpensive way to monitor TLB and its possible effect on cultivar resistance and yield. Researchers commonly estimate resistance by percentage of plant surface damaged (disease severity) but this may not be the best measure for TLB nor relate to yield. Two trials were conducted at the American Samoa Community College Land Grant facility during 1999 - 2000 to assess resistance of taro cultivars P 16 (Meltalt) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{cultivation}} {{experiment was}} conducted in a high-cadmium-contaminated field to evaluate the cadmium uptake by <b>taro</b> (<b>Colocasia</b> esculenta Schott cv. Dansyaku). The cadmium concentration of the whole plants was {{in the order of}} taro>potato>Japanese radish. In addition, the cadmium concentration in the edible parts (daughter corm of taro, Japanese radish root and peeled potato) of each other plant was the lower than that in the other parts. The shoots of Japanese radish and potato accumulated much more cadmium than the roots during cultivation. It is concluded that the edible part of the Japanese radhish root is a safer food material with lower cadmium content than the other root crops...|$|R

An NTR is a recurrence {{of two or more}} distinct tandem motifs interspersed with each other. We propose that nested tandem repeats can be used as phylogenetic and population markers. We have tested our algorithm on both real and simulated data, and present some real nested tandem repeats of interest. We discuss how the NTR found in the ribosomal DNA of <b>taro</b> (<b>Colocasia</b> esculenta) may assist in determining the cultivation prehistory of this ancient staple food crop.

40|$|<b>Taro</b> (<b>Colocasia</b> esculenta) {{is known}} to the Fijians by ten {{different}} names and is cultivated by {{people who lived in}} physically isolated communities for centuries. To the indigenous people, taro is important in their culture. Taro is the most common aroid cultivated by farmers. The demand for taro, especially at the festive Christmas period, appears to be inelastic, as consumers purchase taro regardless of the high prices. Apart from the corm, taro leaves of certain varieties are particularly esteemed as a green vegetable. With the increase in demand for food as a result of population pressure, the practice of shifting cultivation is giving way to intensive taro culture...|$|R
40|$|Sedimentation {{method was}} used for {{isolating}} starch from local cassava (Manihot esculenta) and two types of <b>taro</b> (<b>Colocasia</b> esculentum var. esculenta), one having pink corms and the other having white corms. The extracted starches were characterized for pH, moisture content, ash content, paste clarity and gelatinization temperatures. Cassava starch {{was found to have}} a higher pH and moisture content compared to taro starches while taro starches had a higher ash content. Optical microscopy revealed that taro starches have smaller granule size than cassava starch. Cassava starch showed higher paste clarity than taro starches.

40|$|Several {{physical}} and chemical treatments were employed to modify <b>Taro</b> (<b>Colocasia</b> esculenta) starch. Th e eff ects of pH and heating temperature on their swelling powers and solubilities were studied. At 95 oC, heat-moisture treated, oxidized and acetylated starches were more soluble, while cross-linked starch was less soluble as compared to raw starch. Heat-moisture treated and chemically modifi ed starches had lower swelling power (at 95 oC) than that of isolated starch. Swelling power and solubility {{were found to be}} a function of pH and it was observed that all these modifi ed starches had greater swelling capacity and solubility at pH 2. 0 and 10. 0.
