5|$|In the Iowa caucuses, Keyes did {{not appear}} {{on any of the}} {{election}} totals. Keyes stated that many of the caucus locations he visited did not list him as a choice. His campaign CEO, Stephen Stone blamed much of this on the media and on Keyes's decision to enter the race late. Stone explained that <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>would</b> not acknowledge Keyes's candidacy, making it difficult to run an effective campaign.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Campbell was the Labour Party's Press Secretary and led a {{strategy}} to neutralise {{the influence of the}} press (which had weakened former Labour leader Neil Kinnock) and create allies for the party. While in government, Campbell established a Strategic Communications Unit, a central body whose role was to co-ordinate the party's media relations and ensure that a unified image was presented to the press. Because of his background in tabloid journalism, Campbell understood how different parts of <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>would</b> cover stories. He was a valued news source for journalists because he was close to Blair– he was the first press secretary to regularly attend cabinet meetings.|$|E

500|$|If the Parliament was wholly in Strasbourg, then <b>the</b> news <b>media</b> <b>would</b> also {{no longer}} be able to use shortcuts such as [...] "Brussels decided..." [...] rather than discuss the detail of <b>the</b> {{decision}} markers. <b>Media</b> <b>would</b> also have to be based in Strasbourg and hence might provide better coverage of the Council of Europe. Strasbourg is also preferred for historical reasons, having changed hands between France and Germany five times between 1870 and 1945. It is also argued that Brussels is no longer a good symbol for European unity given the recent political disputes in Belgium.|$|R

25|$|During {{the second}} summer {{session at the}} University, both Moore and Sharpe began to work with players on the {{offensive}} change, and in August Royal and Bellard traveled to Tuscaloosa and led a coaching clinic for the Alabama staff on the wishbone. In {{order to keep the}} change a secret, Bryant closed all of the Crimson Tide's practices closed from the public, screened the practice field from view with a canvas and hired security to keep people away. The change to the wishbone was kept under such secrecy that when <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>would</b> visit practice, Bryant had the team practice the pro-style system that was phased out. Alabama later opened the season with an upset victory over USC that was credited to the surprise switch to the wishbone that caught the Trojans off-guard.|$|E
25|$|According to {{eyewitness}} accounts, about 200 marchers {{broke away}} from the protest route on Queen Street and headed south on Bay Street towards the convention centre, through Financial District. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> <b>would</b> describe the break-off as led by the black bloc, with demonstrators covering their bodies and faces in black clothes. Individuals using the same black bloc tactics have been suspected of being responsible for confrontations in other international summit protests. Protesters dispersed to damage buildings and vehicles. The intent as interpreted by some media was to distract police forces from the security zone so that other protesters could break in, but police maintained their blockades, protecting the fence. Vandals smashed the windows of various office buildings and stores along Yonge Street, Queen Street West and College Street using hammers, flag poles, umbrellas, chunks of pavement and mailboxes. Conflicts also erupted between purported anarchists and journalists who were recording property destruction. After a few hours, many black bloc demonstrators changed into civilian clothes and dissolved into the larger crowd as security forces began to increase in presence. Police later maintained that some protest organizers were complicit in providing cover for the vandals.|$|E

He said, [...] "He thought <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>would</b> gobble it up and just create a small storm that will shift the agenda. But the great Amar Singh and Abu Azmi fuelled the issue by taking him more seriously than what he deserves. The confrontational position aided the MNS volunteers to get into the limelight". Ketkar also said the Shiv Sena would lose in the scenario commenting, [...] "The Sena tried to woo the North Indians after it realised their value as a vote bank in the 2004 defeat. They realised that the demography of the city had changed within a decade. That is when they {{decided it was time to}} please the North Indians. Uddhav started organising Uttar Bharatiya functions. This is the year that he bore the fruits of his efforts. That is why Raj decided to strike at the same sentiment that the Sena played in the past—the Marathi Manoos." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 9, 1983, ABC {{announced}} that Jennings {{had signed a}} four-year contract with the network and would become the sole anchor and senior editor for World News Tonight on September 5. Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program's new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, {{and the beginning of}} what <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>would</b> deem the [...] "Big Three" [...] era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. [...] "With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces," [...] he said. [...] "That's an inevitable byproduct of television.

The head of the FBI in Alaska said that she was not being investigated. Some sources have noted however, that the statute of limitations on the contract incident would have passed. She also criticized the media in an op-ed in The Washington Post in which she said [...] "many in <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>would</b> rather focus on the personality-driven political gossip of the day than on the gravity of these [...] challenges.

In addition, the individual case which has received the most media and police attention thus far is that of Nicole Hoar, a Caucasian woman who disappeared in 2002.

I'm tired of getting pushed around, and our people getting pushed around by the situation in the Middle East." [...] He also demanded that the U.S. military get out of Iraq. He asked if he could be patched through to CNN. The dispatcher told Haq that was not possible, and informed him that talking with <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>would</b> not alter U.S. policy. Haq calmed down and told the dispatcher that he would surrender. He then put his guns down and walked silently out of the building with his hands on his head. He surrendered at 4:15p.m. and was taken into custody by police. At 10:38p.m., he was booked into King County Jail on one count of investigation of homicide and five counts of investigation of attempted murder.|$|E

Newspapers and magazines tacitly agreed not to talk about him at all. In an episode of a comedic duo , host Hikari Ota accidentally said his full name. In , Sayaka Aoki, while displaying only part of his name, said [...] "I put a camera in the chest drawer", which caused a general laugh.

Young told her that by committing suicide she would only harm her parents. Saldívar then asked to contact her mother to say goodbye and ask for forgiveness. She continued to whine [...] "I just wanna die" [...] as Young began talking about religion to determine if she believed in a faith that might cause her to reconsider suicide. Young told Saldívar that if she would give herself up, he would place a jacket over her so that <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>would</b> not have a picture of her face during her surrender. Isaac Valencia told Saldívar that if she were to surrender they promised to turn off all of the lights that were pointing towards her truck; she agreed. As she left her truck, she was scared by the dozens of armed police and FBI agents who were pointing rifles and pistols at her. She ran back to her truck, pointed the gun at her head, and screamed at Young: [...] "They're carrying guns! They're carrying guns! They're going to kill me! They're going to kill me!" [...] Anchor newswoman, María Celeste Arrarás, wrote in her 1997 investigative book, that she found it [...] "curious" [...] for a person who cried for hours that she wanted to die: [...] "would be afraid that someone might make her wish come true."
