5|$|Japanese {{aircraft}} {{soon discovered}} the Allied presence at Milne Bay, which was appreciated as a clear threat to Japanese plans for another seaborne advance on Port Moresby, {{which was to}} start with a landing at Samarai Island in the China Strait, not far from Milne Bay. On 31 July the commander of the Japanese XVII Army, Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake, requested <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> Admiral Gunichi Mikawa's 8th Fleet capture the new Allied base at Milne Bay instead. Mikawa therefore altered his plans for the Samarai operation, and substituted the capture of Milne Bay, which was codenamed Operation RE, and scheduled for the middle of August. Operation RE received a high priority after aircraft from the 25th Air Flotilla discovered the new Milne Bay airfields on 4 August, but was then postponed due to the American landings on Guadalcanal on 7 August.|$|E
5|$|Like {{her sister}} Preussen, Lothringen missed the Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916, though for {{different}} reasons. Preussen had been temporarily transferred to guard duties in the Baltic, while Lothringen {{was in such}} poor condition <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the fleet commander, removed her from the squadron. Jutland proved to Scheer that the pre-dreadnought battleships were too vulnerable {{to take part in}} a major fleet action, and so detached the II Squadron from the High Seas Fleet. Lothringen became a guard ship in the Baltic after she left the battle fleet. The following year she was transferred to Wilhelmshaven, where she was used as an exercise ship, as well as to train engineers. She served in this capacity until the end of the war in 1918.|$|E

25|$|Doc Maynard's {{character}} and approach to city-building differed {{from that of}} his contemporaries William Bell, Arthur Denny, David Denny, Henry Yesler, and Carson Boren. In part, {{this may have been}} because he was much older and had already participated in the development of one city. He drank liquor (while the Denny Party were mostly teetotalers) and, with his friend Captain Felker, found someone to start a good brothel in Seattle — the infamous Mother Damnable — believing <b>that</b> <b>vice</b> was essential to the economic success of a frontier town of that time.|$|E

In 1975, Lowe speculated <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> President Nelson A. Rockefeller, an older brother of Winthrop Rockefeller, had retained support within the Arkansas GOP because of “the feelings for his brother,” but Nelson Rockefeller soon removed himself for consideration to a full term and was replaced on the unsuccessful 1976 Republican ticket by Robert J.

25|$|In an {{interview}} in 2007, Whitman stated <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> President Dick Cheney's insistence on easing air pollution controls, not the personal reasons she cited at the time, led to her resignation. At the time, Cheney pushed the EPA to institute a new rule allowing power plants to make major alterations without installing costly new pollution controls. Whitman stepped down in protest against such demand by the White House, she said. She decided that {{because she did not}} agree with the rule, she {{would not be able to}} defend it if it were to be challenged in a legal action. The federal court eventually overturned the rule on the ground that it violated the Clean Air Act.|$|E

25|$|Seychelles' {{previous}} president France Albert René came {{to power}} after his supporters overthrew the first president James Mancham on 5 June 1977 in a coup d'état and installed him as president. René {{was at that time}} the prime minister. René ruled as a strongman under a socialist one-party system until in 1993, when he was forced to introduce a multi-party system. He stepped down in 2004 in favour of his vice-president, James Michel, who was re-elected in 2006 and again in 2011. On 28 September 2016, the Office of the President announced that Michel would step down effective 16 October, and <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> President Danny Faure would complete the rest of Michel's term.|$|E
25|$|Dean {{was criticized}} during his 2004 presidential {{campaign}} for another decision related to civil unions.

On the campaign trail, he demanded <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> President Dick Cheney release his energy committee papers. Many people, including Democratic Senator and failed 2004 presidential candidate Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, who left the party after losing his primary for re-election in 2006, accused Dean of hypocrisy. Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit to force the papers be opened before the seal expired, but lost.|$|E
25|$|On August 7, 2008, Leykis interviewed {{an officer}} {{involved}} in the investigation.

Her ex-boyfriend, Tortsen Rockwood, died of a gunshot wound in 2001, and, while the death was originally ruled a suicide, police later named Vice as their suspect in the case. Sometime after the murder confession was made on Leykis's show, Vice filed a police report stating that her cell phone had been stolen. In 2009, it was revealed that police reviewed the death of Rockwood and determined that all the evidence was consistent with suicide and <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> would not be charged with murder; however, she was charged with filing a false police report for claiming that her cell phone was stolen.|$|E

25|$|On 7 August, Ken McGonigle, aged 50, {{a former}} member of the RUC, saved the life of one of the most senior US {{officers}} in Afghanistan when he was killed. He was working in Musa Qal’eh, Helmand province with private security company New Century, when he exchanged fire with two escaped Taliban prisoners who were taking aim with a grenade launcher at a US special forces helicopter leaving a base. The 50-year-old Co Londonderry father of four was shot dead and two US Marines were subsequently killed in the fight. But the MV-22B Osprey aircraft, which can operate as both a helicopter and a turbo-prop aeroplane, escaped. It later emerged <b>that</b> <b>vice</b> admiral Robert Harward, a three-star US Navy SEAL who has been nominated to take over as deputy commander of US forces in Afghanistan, was in the aircraft.

[...] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, [...] "t is telling <b>that</b> <b>Vice</b> President Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers.

500|$|The final extant book {{begins with}} a {{description}} of the nature of Christ, and that of the true Christian, who aims to be as similar as possible to both the Father and the Son. Clement then criticizes the simplistic anthropomorphism of most ancient religions, quoting Xenophanes' famous description of African, Thracian and Egyptian deities. The Greek gods may also have had their origins in the personification of material objects: Ares representing iron, and Dionysus wine. Prayer, and the relationship between love and knowledge are then discussed. [...] seems to contradict the characterization of the true Christian as one who knows; but to Clement knowledge vanishes only in that it is subsumed by the universal love expressed by the Christian in his reverence for his Creator. Following Socrates, he argues <b>that</b> <b>vice</b> arises from a state of ignorance, not from intention. The Christian is a [...] "laborer in God's vineyard", responsible both for his own path to salvation and that of his neighbor. The work ends with an extended passage against the contemporary divisions and heresies within the church.|$|E
500|$|Love in Several Masques is a {{traditional}} comic drama that incorporates morality. The theme of the play is the relationship of disguises and courtship {{with a discussion of}} the nature of love. Fielding focuses on men and how they deal with love and marriage. Also, the gentlemen must prove their worth before they can be justified in their marriage, which allows Fielding to describe the traits required in successful male suitors. The first act deals primarily with the gentlemen in order to establish a focus on their characteristics. Fielding's first play serves as a representation for his belief in the relationship of morality and libertine beliefs and introduces character types that he would use throughout his plays and novels. However, all negative characteristics are very apparent to the audience, and those characters who are immoral are unable to accomplish their goals. The main characters are still decent individuals who are able to help another, even though they sometimes get in each other's way. At no time is the audience able to believe <b>that</b> <b>vice</b> will conquer, which undermines part of the satire. Regardless, Harold Pagliaro is still able to conclude that [...] "Fielding's satire on the marriage market, however, is effective, if not biting." ...|$|E
