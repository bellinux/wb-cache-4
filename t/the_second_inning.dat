On August 26, Richard hit his first home run of the season during <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>inning</b> of the game. In his last {{game of the season}} on October 2, Richard pitched a complete game 13-strikeout performance, and he also hit a two-run home run in the sixth inning.|$|E
5|$|Greer Stadium {{has been}} the setting for eight no-hit games, {{including}} one perfect game. The first took place on May 16, 1981, when Jeff Cornell, of the visiting Jacksonville Suns, pitched a 4–0 no-hit game against the Sounds. The second no-hitter at Greer was Jim Deshaies' 5–1 win over the Columbus Astros on May 4, 1984. In <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>inning,</b> Deshaies walked three batters and hit another, accounting for the only Astros run of the game, part of a seven-inning doubleheader.

5|$|In 2010, Uribe re-signed a one-year, $3.25 million {{contract}} with the Giants. He began 2010 as the Giants' second baseman because of an injury to Freddy Sanchez. At the beginning of May, he moved over to shortstop to replace the injured Rentería; {{for most of the}} remainder of the season, he was the Giants' starting shortstop. He hit a game-winning two-run home run on September 5 against Jonathan Broxton, turning a 4–3 deficit into a 5–4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. On September 23, Uribe hit a grand slam against Ryan Dempster and a two-run home run in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>inning</b> against the Cubs for a total of six RBIs, helping the Giants win 13–0.|$|E

Matsui answered back, adding to the Yankees lead again with a single with the bases loaded in the bottom of the third, scoring Derek Jeter and Johnny Damon. Damon, injured running the bases while scoring, was replaced defensively {{in the top of the}} fourth by Jerry Hairston, Jr.|$|E

Andy Pafko scored the game's first run with a home run to left field to make the score 1–0.

5|$|On January 26, 2012, Ross {{finalized}} {{a one-year}} contract with the Boston Red Sox. He was supposed to provide depth off the bench, but injuries, particularly to Carl Crawford, led to him holding a starting role for the entire season. He started almost every day for Boston in all three outfield positions, but mainly right field. On April 14, Ross hit his first home run in a Red Sox uniform, a two-run shot off the Tampa Bay Rays's Dane De La Rosa in a 13–5 Red Sox victory. The next day, Ross hit a three-run homer {{in the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>inning</b> off Matt Moore in a 6–4 victory over the Rays. On May 18, 2012, Ross suffered a fractured foot after fouling a ball off his foot. He was placed on the disabled list and expected to miss from six to eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|Paciorek, {{who was the}} {{starting}} right fielder, began {{the day with a}} walk in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>inning.</b> He then had a single in the fourth inning, which drove in Rusty Staub and Bob Aspromonte. After singling and again bringing home Aspromonte in the fifth, Paciorek had a walk in the sixth, and ended the day with a leadoff single in the eighth. In total, he went to the plate five times and hit three singles and had two walks, scoring four runs en route to a 134 Houston victory over the New York Mets. He had a perfect major league career batting average and on-base percentage of 1.000 {{as a result of his}} performance that day, something no one else with as many plate appearances as Paciorek has done.|$|E

5|$|Pee Wee Reese singled and Jackie Robinson homered, scoring {{two runs}} for the Dodgers in the first inning; the Giants had one player reach base on an error, making the score 2–0 after one inning. In <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>inning,</b> Gil Hodges singled and reached third base on an error, {{allowing}} the Dodgers to potentially score again. After Rube Walker's hit the Giants threw Hodges out at home plate, and two further outs ended their turn at bat. The Giants had two consecutive hits in their half, a double hit by Thomson and a single hit by Mays, but they failed to score as well after two groundouts, leaving the score 2–0. After one out, Duke Snider walked and Robinson singled to start the third inning, and Jones was removed from pitching duties, replaced by George Spencer.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers {{entered the}} game with a 76–54 record and a 6.5-game lead in the NL West over the Houston Astros, while the Montreal Expos were 11 games back in third place in the NL East with a 66–64 record {{entering}} the game. With the August 30 win, the Dodgers retained their 6.5-game lead. The win marked the Dodgers' fifth consecutive win and twelfth out of 15. Hershiser contributed a two-run double in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>inning</b> to help the Dodgers build a 3–0 lead. After Hershiser gave up two runs in the fifth, no baserunners reached second base against him in the final four innings, thus marking the first four scoreless innings of his streak. The game marked Hershiser's third consecutive and tenth complete game of the season. Following the game, his 2.84 ERA ranked third on the team behind Tim Leary (2.44) and John Tudor (2.37).|$|E
5|$|The Phillies began August {{by placing}} Cliff Lee on the {{disabled}} list, replacing him on the roster with Cesar Jimenez; however, David Buchanan was eventually expected to take Lee's place in the starting rotation. They continued their series with the Washington Nationals, winning 2–1 with another strong outing from Roberto Hernandez and a home run by Marlon Byrd. After wins in the series' first two games, starting pitcher A. J. Burnett was ejected in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>inning</b> of the third game for arguing with home plate umpire Chris Guccione about the strike zone. Burnett's first ejection in his 16-season career sparked 11 runs by the Nationals, who shut out the Phillies. The team also lost the rubber match 4–0 the following day, when Cole Hamels had no run support in a pitchers' duel with Stephen Strasburg.|$|E

5|$|Boudreau placed Gromek in the {{starting}} rotation to begin the 1949 Cleveland Indians season, giving the team a big four of Feller, Bob Lemon, Gene Bearden, and Gromek, who had spent the past year working on his curveball to help him improve on his 1948 season. In his first start of the season, he allowed two hits in an 8–2 victory against the Browns. By the end of May, he had an ERA of 2.80, which was among the lowest on the team, but only had a 2–4 record {{to show for it}} {{due to a lack of}} run support; the four losses included both a 1–0 and 2–0 defeat. With the increased productivity of Early Wynn and Mike Garcia, Gromek fell out of favor with Boudreau, and he was moved primarily to relief duty. After being pulled in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>inning</b> in a July 16 start against the Athletics, he was kept as a reliever the rest of the year. Gromek finished the season with four wins, six losses, and a 3.33 ERA in 92 innings over 27 games, 12 of them starts.|$|E
5|$|In the ballpark's inaugural game on April 17, 2015, the Sounds {{defeated}} the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, 3–2 in 10 innings, {{courtesy of a}} walk-off double hit by Max Muncy that scored Billy Burns from first base. Nashville's Arnold León recorded the first strikeout at First Tennessee Park when Colorado Springs' Matt Long struck out swinging as the leadoff hitter {{at the top of}} the first inning. The park's first hit was a left field single that came in the top of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>inning</b> off the bat of Colorado Springs' Matt Clark, who played for the Sounds in 2014. Clark also recorded the stadium's first RBI, slapping a single to center field in the fourth inning that sent Luis Sardiñas across the plate for the park's first run. The first home run in the park's history was hit by Nashville's Joey Wendle four games later on April 21 against the Oklahoma City Dodgers.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the Cardinals were {{wavering}} between starting Murry Dickson or Harry Brecheen in game two, {{while the}} Dodgers {{were looking to}} use either Higbe, who had pitched in the previous game, or Joe Hatten; the two clubs went with Dickson and Hatten. Hatten began {{the game in the}} top of the first inning by only allowing one hit to Terry Moore. In the bottom of the first, the Dodgers scored the game's first run. After Eddie Stanky struck out, and Dick Whitman flied out, Augie Galan singled. He was brought home by a walk and another single. After Carl Furillo flied out, the first inning ended with a score of 1–0. In the top of the second, the Cardinals responded when Erv Dusak tripled after a Slaughter ground out. Marty Marion hit a sacrifice fly to score Dusak, and after a single by Clyde Kluttz, Dickson tripled to score another run, giving St. Louis a 2–1 lead, before a fly out ended their half of the inning. Dickson walked Bruce Edwards, but retired the next three batters, leaving the score 2–1 at the end of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>inning.</b>|$|E
