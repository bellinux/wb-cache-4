The Act had been drafted during the financial disarray late in the War of 1812 and called for Notes of denomination less than $100 which would bear no interest. The issued denominations were as low as $3, their size was typical of banknotes and, unlike the previously issued Notes, they were payable to bearer rather than to order. However, they were not a Legal Tender for private transactions. Like the larger Notes issued under the February 24, 1815 Act, this issue was also supported by the government's promise to receive them at face value for purchasing bonds at par, but in the case of the Small Notes the bonds were <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> 7% <b>interest.</b> Before the notes could be issued, however, the war had ended - an occasion which led to the 7% bonds being worth more than par, and the Small Treasury Notes, of which $3,392,994 were originally issued, were rapidly exchanged for the bonds.

Receipts from cotton sales provided funding for some schools, balanced the nation's trade deficit, fortified the US dollar, and procured foreign exchange earnings in British pound sterling, the world's reserve currency at the time.

40|$|In {{response}} to an increasing global awareness of environmental valuation, Kabwoya Wildlife Reserve in Uganda was established in 1996. Parallel to ongoing operations regarding significant oil discoveries in the region, the reserve is today operated through a conservation strategy of wildlife-based tourism. Although the region is expected to experience an increase in oil activities, this conservation strategy {{has been found to}} facilitate a win-win outcome for all involved stakeholders. Concerns have, however, been raised in {{response to}} local distribution of benefits from both conservation efforts and oil extraction. Through a political ecology approach, using on qualitative methodology, research was conducted in two of the reserve’s neighboring villages to shed more light on these concerns. The purpose of the research was multi-faceted: the first aim was to find out how the establishment of the Kabwoya Wildlife Reserve has affected local access to resources. The second purpose was to investigate whether local communities have benefitted from wildlife-based tourism, either through active or passive engagement. A third aspect examined how oil activity has affected the area through chosen parameters, and lastly, the study aimed to investigate local attitudes towards a future coexistence of environmental conservation and oil development. Regarding the actual establishment of the reserve, findings imply that local <b>interests</b> had <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> external <b>interests</b> and pressures, justified through "green" purposes. The results further indicate that {{a substantial portion of the}} benefits received from wildlife-based tourism is accumulated within the accounts of management agencies. As far as the influence of oil activities, it appears that the environmental impacts have so far been mitigated, but the challenges faced are expected to increase in the years to come. Regarding the possibility of future coexistence between the Kabwoya Reserve and natural resource interests, the findings have indicated varying perceptions, but have not provided any definitive answers. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{determination}} of stock prices and equilibrium expected {{rates of return}} in a general equilibrium setting is still imperfectly understood. In particular, as Grossman and Shiller (1981) and others have argued, stock returns appear to be too volatile given the smooth process for dividends and consumption growth. Mehra and Prescott (1985) claim that this smoothness in consumption and dividend growth gives rise to an “equity premium paradox” since it {{makes it impossible to}} explain the equity risk premium with a risk aversion parameter of less than an implausible 35. This paper reconciles the apparent smoothness of aggregate dividends and the volatility of observed stock prices by developing a model of stock prices in a dynamic general equilibrium setting in which learning is important. Dividends, which are one component of the aggregate consumption endowment, are assumed to follow a stochastic process with a mean-reverting drift that is not directly observable by the representative agent but must be estimated from the realized growth rates of dividends and aggregate consumption. The stock price-dividend ratio is shown to depend on the current estimate of the dividend growth rate {{as well as on the}} level of uncertainty about the true growth rate. This non-observability of the growth rate of dividends introduces an element of learning into the stock valuation process which is shown to increase the volatility of the stock price and therefore reduce the level of risk aversion required to explain the equity premium. The model is calibrated to the observed joint dividend and consumption process for the US, and is shown <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> an <b>interest</b> rate and stock price process that conform closely to the stylized facts for US capital markets...|$|R
40|$|Canada and the United States {{have been}} {{involved}} in a long-running dispute over U. S. efforts to protect U.

This dispute was prolonged by virtue of the fact that Canada and the United States not only are parties to the North American Free Trade Agreement (2 ̆ 2 NAFTA 2 ̆ 2), but also are members of the World Trade Organization (2 ̆ 2 WTO 2 ̆ 2). NAFTA contains provisions for the resolution of a trade dispute by an arbitration panel. A WTO agreement known as the Dispute Settlement Understanding (2 ̆ 2 DSU 2 ̆ 2) separately provides for the creation of panels to resolve trade disputes. Because these NAFTA provisions and the DSU are parallel dispute-settlement mechanisms, independent of each other, it is possible for a party to have separate recourse to each of these mechanisms. Seeking to compel the United States to refund duties already collected, and to refrain from collecting future duties, Canada had separate recourse to dispute settlement under each of NAFTA and the DSU. In response, the United States also had separate recourse to each of these dispute settlement mechanisms. This essay shows that the NAFTA proceedings were essentially favorable to Canada, but that the United States was unwilling to look to NAFTA, a regional agreement, as the appropriate basis for resolving this regional dispute. The essay argues that the United States sought to rely on its hegemonic economic power to coerce Canada <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> the <b>interests</b> of U. S. producers, and shows that, when the result was a diplomatic crisis, the United States offered to settle the dispute, {{not on the basis of}} legal principle, but simply by making monetary payment in the form of a refund of certain of the duties that had been collected. The essay concludes by questioning whether the U. S. approach is either defensible as a matter of international law, or likely to prove sustainable over the long term...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{international}} effects of taxation. Tax policies have profound effects on the temporal composition and on the intertemporal evolution of the macro economy. The analysis highlights key issues pertinent for the understanding of international effects of domestic tax policies and of international tax harmonization. The analytical framework adopts the saving-investment balance approach {{to the analysis of}} international economic interdependence and includes a detailed specification of public and private sector behavior focusing on the roles played by taxes on income, consumption, and international borrowing. We present stylized facts on the average consumption and income tax rates for the seven major industrial countries. They reveal large international diversity of tax rates and tax structures. The analytical framework is used to analyze the consequences of revenue-neutral conversions between income and consumption (VAT) tax systems. We demonstrate analytically that the effects of such changes in the structure of taxes depend critically on international differences in saving and investment propensities which in turn govern the time profile of the current account of the balance of payments. The key results are also illustrated by means of dynamic simulations. We then examine the international effects of budget deficits and public-debt management and demonstrate analytically as well as by means of dynamic simulations that these effects depend critically on whether the government manages its deficit through alterations in income or consumption (VAT) taxes. Finally, motivated by proposals for tax harmonization associated with the single market in Europe of 1992, we consider the effects of international tax harmonization. The main results, demonstrate that, in analogy with the effects of tax conversions, the effect of harmonization depends critically on the inter-country differences in saving and investment propensities. These differences are shown <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> conflicts of <b>interests</b> in the tax harmonization program. ...|$|R
