6000|$|... "I can't do {{anything}} {{with some of these}} fellows," [...] explained {{the man in charge of}} the blasting. [...] "I tell them just what to do, and sometimes <b>they</b> <b>mind</b> <b>me</b> and sometimes they don't. I'm very sorry this thing happened, but I'm thankful at the same time that you got through as well as you did," [...] and he smiled a little.|$|E
6000|$|Aunt Ellen was kind, and {{accepted}} Carey's apology {{when she found}} that Jock had really been punished. Only she said, [...] "You must be firm with that boy, Caroline, or you will be sorry for it. My boys know that what I have said is to be done, {{and they know it}} is of no use to disobey. I am happy to say <b>they</b> <b>mind</b> <b>me</b> at a word; but that John of yours needs a tight hand. The Colonel thinks that the sooner he is at school the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|What {{does the}} officer say? [...] "Dam! Dam! Dam! [...] Mud and misery, flies and stench, [...] Piggin' {{it here in}} a beastly trench, [...] But what I mean, by Jove, you see, [...] I like my men and <b>they</b> don't <b>mind</b> <b>me,</b> [...] So, on the whole, I'd rather be [...] Where I am." ...|$|R

"I'd {{rather not}} try my dignity on these underlings, Mrs. Vervain; there's no American {{squadron}} here that I could order to bombard Fusina, if <b>they</b> didn't <b>mind</b> <b>me.</b> But I'll see what I can do further in quality of courteous foreigner. Can you perhaps {{tell me how}} long you will be obliged to detain us here?" [...] he asked of the guard again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I doant care," [...] {{the child}} said sturdily; [...] "if I goes out in charge o' they dogs, <b>theys</b> got to <b>mind</b> <b>me,</b> {{and how can}} I make 'em <b>mind</b> <b>me</b> if I doant welt 'em? What would 'ee say to I if Bess got had up afore the court for pinning t' parson's coo?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys," [...] said Jones, {{as we sat}} {{round the}} campfire, [...] "I see you're getting in shape. Well, I've worn off the wire edge myself. And I have the hounds coming fine. <b>They</b> <b>mind</b> <b>me</b> now, but they're mystified. For the life of them they can't {{understand}} what I mean. I don't blame them. Wait till, by good luck, we get a cougar in a tree. When Sounder and Don see that, we've lion dogs, boys! we've lion dogs! But Moze is a stubborn brute. In all my years of animal experience, I've never discovered {{any other way to}} make animals obey than by instilling fear and respect into their hearts. I've been fond of buffalo, horses and dogs, but sentiment never ruled me. When animals must obey, they must--that's all, and no mawkishness! But I never trusted a buffalo in my life. If I had I wouldn't be here to-night. You all know how many keepers of tame wild animals get killed. I could tell you dozens of tragedies. And I've often thought, since I got back from New York, of that woman I saw with her troop of African lions. I dream about those lions, and see them leaping over her head. What a grand sight that was! But the public is fooled. I read somewhere that she trained those lions by love. I don't believe it. I saw her use a whip and a steel spear. Moreover, I saw many things that escaped most observers--how she entered the cage, how she maneuvered among them, how she kept a compelling gaze on them! It was an admirable, a great piece of work. Maybe she loves those huge yellow brutes, but her life was in danger every moment while she was in that cage, and she knew it. Some day, one of her pets likely the King of Beasts she pets the most will rise up and kill her. That is as certain as death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Never <b>mind.</b> <b>They</b> know <b>me</b> at Winks and Pinks,” {{she replied}} inconsequently. Agatha {{apparently}} {{has an idea}} that blotting-paper is only sold in small quantities to persons of known reputation, who may be trusted not to put it to dangerous or improper uses. After walking some two hundred yards {{she began to feel}} that her tea was of more immediate importance than my blotting-paper.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] pursued Mara, {{in a tone}} of lamentation, [...] "I {{could no}} more get into a {{carriage}} and drive to Brunswick as you can, than I could fly. I can't drive, Sally--something is the matter with me; and the horses always know it the minute I take the reins; they always twitch their ears and stare round into the chaise at me, as much as to say, 'What! you there?' and I feel sure <b>they</b> never will <b>mind</b> <b>me.</b> And then how you can make those wonderful bargains you do, I can't see!--you talk up to the clerks and the men, and somehow you talk everybody round; but as for me, if I only open my mouth in the humblest way to dispute the price, everybody puts me down. I always tremble when I go into a store, and people talk to me just as if I was a little girl, and once or twice they have made me buy things that I knew I didn't want, just because they will talk me down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Polly, my dear," [...] {{the sick}} woman {{said to her}} one {{afternoon}} when the girl had been reading to her for some time, and was now busy mending some of the boys' clothes, while baby, nearly a year old, was gravely amusing herself with a battered doll upon the floor, [...] "I used to think, though I never said so, as your feyther war making a mistake in bringing you up different to other gals here; but I see as he was right. There ain't one of them as would have been content to give up all their time and thoughts to a sick woman as thou hast done. There ain't {{a house in the}} village as tidy and comfortable as this, and the boys <b>mind</b> you as <b>they</b> never <b>minded</b> <b>me.</b> When I am gone Luke will miss me, but thar won't be no difference in his comfort, and I know thou'lt look arter baby and be a mother to her. I don't suppose as thou wilt stay here long; thou art over fifteen now, and the lads will not be long afore they begin to come a-coorting of thee. But doan't ee marry in Varley, Polly. My Luke's been a good husband to me. But thou know'st what the most of them be--they may do for Varley bred gals, but not for the like of thee. And when thou goest take baby wi' thee and bring her up like thysel till she be old enough to coom back and look arter Luke and the house." ...|$|R
