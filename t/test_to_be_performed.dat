A medical {{certificate}} from a GP {{is the first}} step onto sickness benefits; although a government-run eligibility test was brought in alongside Incapacity Benefit in 1995, critics said that officials still accepted too many claims using information supplied by the claimants themselves and their GPs without asking for an All Work <b>Test</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed,</b> partly because the pool of medical assessors was relatively small and partly because doctors' time was costly - which was why large numbers of nurses were brought in to perform the new test introduced in 2008.|$|E

40|$|Politecnico di Torino and G. D. S. Instruments Ltd, UK has {{developed}} an innovative servo controlled direct shear apparatus named High Pressure Back Pressure Shear Apparatus-HPBPSA. The apparatus allows direct shear <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> under closely controlled conditions in terms of axial load and back pressure applied to the specimen. Two shear boxes, built in stainless steel, <b>are</b> available <b>to</b> host cylindrical specimens of 50 or 100 mm diameter and 50 mm height. If a <b>test</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> on a joint, different gaps up {{to a maximum of}} may be set between the two halves of the shear box. The apparatus is equipped with a number of measuring transducers that allow for <b>testing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> in closely controlled conditions.

30|$|Another {{difference}} in the guidelines <b>was</b> stipulated <b>to</b> mitigate bioavailability-related risks in patients with lower stomach acid.

Thus, the guidelines requires <b>BE</b> <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> on subjects with low gastric acidity, if the test formulation shows a dissolution profile different from the reference product in neutral (pH  6.8) media.

40|$|Abstract. We find no {{evidence}} {{for the presence of}} genuinely young galaxies in our Local universe. We argue that the metal deficiencies and the behavior of the N/O and C/O ratios meet several plausible explanations involving the primary and secondary nature of these elements and their dispersion and mixing by massive stars and intermediate mass stars. Colors are to be analysed using surface photometry and comparing several model scenario since an instant burst model unavoidably provides a lower limit to the age.
