500|$|Many politicians, {{mostly from}} the Labor {{government}} of New South Wales, reacted to the security breach with concern and unease. Police Minister David Andrew Campbell expressed disappointment and concern over the stunt, arguing that there were [...] "21 world leaders arriving in the city at the one time {{and it needs to}} be taken seriously". Then New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma said that while he was a fan of the show, those involved would have to face the full force of the law. The then Federal Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd, also from the Labor Party, voiced similar concerns, saying that [...] "I'm a fan of The Chaser... but I think <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> crossed the line." ...|$|E
2500|$|During 2015, {{the group}} {{established}} a fake company to gain entry to a speech being given by Prime Minister David Cameron at the Confederation of British Industry where they heckled him and held banners stating [...] "CBI = voice of Brussels". Cummings subsequently stated: [...] "You {{think it is}} nasty? You ain’t seen nothing yet. <b>These</b> <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> failed the country, {{they are going to}} be under the magnifying glass. Tough shit ... It is going to be tough". The campaign also stated their intention to target and disrupt meetings of pro-EU organisations and companies. In a letter to the Electoral Commission, Sir Eric Pickles, the former Conservative cabinet minister, said he believed Vote Leave had disqualified itself from lead status in the referendum (which entitles the campaign to public funding) after it pledged to run a [...] "nasty" [...] campaign against opponents.|$|E
2500|$|Concerning the group's {{reputation}} for womanizing and heavy drinking, Joey Bishop stated in a 1998 interview: [...] "I never saw Frank, Dean, Sammy or Peter drunk during performances.

Trenticosta said, [...] "It is not that <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>had</b> super privileges. But Warden Cain was somewhat responsive to not only prisoners, but to their families." ...|$|R

5000|$|Rooted in blues {{rock and}} heavy metal, Orchid are highly praised by rock critics for bearing much {{resemblance}} to pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, {{because of the}} band's dark, heavy riff-based doom metal sound. British heavy metal magazine Metal Hammer said of the band, [...] "Thought Sabbath had already written all the best riffs? Think again - <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> some monsters".|$|E
5000|$|After the announcement, {{not much}} news {{circulated}} regarding the project the developer was currently working on. The developer was keeping its current project under wraps: [...] "Now we're in full production, we're itching {{to share the}} fantastic work <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> been producing" [...] stated Liddon. On 22 May 2009, {{it was announced that}} the developer had added 15 new members to its team.|$|E
5000|$|Abeles' {{denial of}} any {{knowledge}} of mafia involvement in his business is supported in an interview conducted by the Australian Federal Police with Fratianno in San Francisco in 1979 when {{he told them that}} [...] "I don't think that he knew <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>had</b> connections." [...] The payments, Fratianno said, were all legal, paid to corporations to ensure there would be no Union trouble on the docks; nothing was given [...] "under the table." ...|$|R

The truth is <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>had</b> almost nothing to do with 'Pac's life, but they never cease to come up with new ways to exploit his death for profit or fame.” ...|$|R

5000|$|Given the {{similarities}} between the shooters at Columbine and Martin Peyerl and the short amount of time between their respective rampages, it is possible Peyerl was influenced by the massacre at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999. Martin commented one day leading up to November 1, 1999 that it was [...] "completely crazy what <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> done" [...] and that he believed Harris' and Klebold's actions to be [...] "something we should do".|$|E

5000|$|In a four star {{review by}} Journal of Gospel, Bob Marovich said [...] "Five Star Generals is well {{produced}} and engineered. Of course the language on Five Star Generals is metaphorical, but there's no denying the group's tough-talking, no-holds-barred stance. These guys aren't playing around. They have fashioned themselves into spiritual superheroes declaring all-out street {{war on the}} demons who have encircled and imprisoned Christians. <b>These</b> <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> God's back, and visa versa." ...|$|E

5000|$|AllMusic {{published}} a supportive review by music critic Gregory Heaney, who remarked that [...] "the band delivers an energetic set that'll easily make listeners forget <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> been at it" [...] {{for about four}} decades. He additionally remarked that Live From da House of Rust [...] "bundles the stalwart rock band's stage presence into a nice little package, giving you the best seat in the house".

That was the first line to “El Pito,” which was always {{followed}} by five quick toots. In the mid-’60s those five notes heralded an emerging musical movement. From El Barrio to the South Bronx, hipsters in knit shirts and Caesar haircuts went around whistling, clapping and singing, “I’ll {{never go back to}} Georgia! I’ll never go back!” Of course, the farthest south most of <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>had</b> ever been was Delancey Street to buy their Playboy loafers.″ ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{the group}} {{eventually}} died, its members were scattered. The biggest group of members (Chaos, Diddle, Zaphod, 16 Beat, Jester, Cthulu, Hawk, Cruiser, Vindicator, and Panther) left {{to form a}} new section of Rebels. They released the demo [...] "Sanity Is Dead" [...] under the Rebels label to announce this. Their stay in Rebels would be a short one, however, and soon most of <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>had</b> formed the NEW Sanity, which also included several ex-members of the original Sanity, like musician Bit Arts (ex-Red Sector Inc.) and coders Flosoft and Mr. Pet. Sanity was later rebuilt in 1992 by several of the original members, most of whom were in Rebels in the meantime.|$|R

[...] "The interrogation became less about me and more about politics and e-gold," [...] Bradley said. [...] "They {{were trying to get}} me to blame e-gold for fraud.

5000|$|A beautiful, radical fusion can {{be found}} on Deep Forest's latest release, Boheme (550/Sony). Their {{previous}} record also concentrated on the indigenous pygmies of central Africa. This one takes a great deal of inspiration from Eastern Europe as well. It heavily samples Marta Sebestyen (late of Muzsikas) and they actually have her sing one track to order. <b>These</b> <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> taken the art of the remix to a new plateau. As the acid jazz group United Future Organization does in its milieu, Deep Forest takes elements from non-Western music.

5000|$|Accounts vary {{as to why}} the pie {{fight was}} cut. In a 1969 interview, Kubrick said, [...] "I decided it was farce and not {{consistent}} with the satiric tone {{of the rest of the}} film." [...] Critic Alexander Walker observed that [...] "the cream pies were flying around so thickly that people lost definition, and you couldn't really say whom you were looking at." [...] Nile Southern, son of screenwriter Terry Southern, suggested the fight was intended to be less jovial: [...] "Since they were laughing, it was unusable, because instead of having that totally black, which would have been amazing, like, this blizzard, which in a sense is metaphorical for all of the missiles that are coming, as well, you just <b>have</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>having</b> a good old time. So, as Kubrick later said, 'it was a disaster of Homeric proportions.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|BMA Magazine {{wrote of}} the band, [...] "it would appear that <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>have</b> been brought up on a diet of late 60s British pop, mid 70s American blues, yet at times, with a {{peculiar}} mid 90s britpop feel. One could even think at times {{that they are a}} decade, if not three, out of time. Think Supergass meets the Libertines meets the Beatles meets Dire Straits and you'd be wrong, but close. Worth a listen." [...] BMA also commented on their latest record, Goody Hallett and Other Stories that it is a [...] "solid album with some definite single-worthy tracks", and that it [...] "wouldn't have sounded out of place in a groovy record shop in swinging London." ...|$|E

5000|$|Todd Lyons, {{giving the}} EP four stars for About.com, states, [...] "With all their flashes of interesting, solid musicianship {{especially}} from Taylor Pool’s keyboard fills, the EP wrestles itself above a raggedy demo presentation, but threatens to cave {{in under the}} weight of its overtly obvious message." [...] Rating the EP three and a half stars at Louder Than the Music, Jono Davies says, [...] "This is most definitely a real metal fans, metal EP!"

5000|$|When I {{first started}} working with George {{he told me about}} the story and the initial plan was to make this epic three- or four-hour movie. We wanted to start in the United States and show the full racism <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> <b>had</b> to go through, then go to the heroic story that we’re telling now and then come back and do the {{beginning}} of the Civil Rights movement. But it was just so unwieldy and also at that time, {{there was no way to}} have a roadshow three-hour movie in American cinemas. Every epic film had been a financial disaster, and we felt there just wasn’t an audience we could get the film out to. Then we got heavily into Young Indiana Jones, which ran for three or four years, then the Star Wars Special Editions and the prequels, but throughout we did continue talking. However, once we finished Episode III we decided to go and meet people in the black community. Interview with Rick McCallum, June 9, 2012 ...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{negative}} review, VideoGamer said The Arrival is a [...] "frustrating game, {{not just because}} it can be occasionally unfair but because <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> clearly <b>have</b> no idea how to promote fear. Running around playing kiss chase with a trans-dimensional being doesn't really cut it." [...] and gave it a score of 4/10. The Metro also criticized the lack of varied gameplay, stating, [...] "the first game had little real gameplay and this sequel does nothing to expand things, just repeat the experience often enough to rob it of its power." [...] and gave it a score of 6/10.|$|R
