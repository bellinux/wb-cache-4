25|$|Glasgow police {{decided to}} use the {{occasion}} of the public address to effect the arrest. However, the WSPU activists anticipated their action and increased security coverage for their leader, including enforcing strict secrecy surrounding her movements and erecting a concealed barbed wire barrier across the front of the stage. A short time into Pankhurst's speech, around 160 police officers stormed the hall and began to move toward the stage. They were met by a barrage of thrown chairs and plant pots, and soon fights broke out between the police and members of the audience. During the commotion one of the women present drew a revolver and fired several blank cartridges <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The police attempted to apprehend her, but she managed to slip their grasp and escape. Although not positively identified at the time, many since have stated that Janie Allan was the woman with the revolver.|$|E
25|$|Airtemp {{was more}} {{sophisticated}} and efficient than the complicated rival air conditioners of 1953. It recirculated, rather than merely cooled, the air inside the vehicle, {{and it was also}} the highest capacity unit available on an automobile. It was also simple to operate, with a single switch on the dashboard marked with low, medium, and high positions, which the driver selected as desired. The system was capable of cooling a Chrysler from 120 degrees to 85 degrees in about two minutes, and of completely eliminating humidity, dust, pollen and tobacco smoke at the same time. Since it relied on fresh air, and drew in sixty percent more of it than any contemporary system, Airtemp avoided the staleness associated with automotive air conditioning at the time. It was silent and unobtrusive. Instead of plastic tubes mounted on the package shelf as on GM and on other cars, small ducts directed cool air <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the car where it filtered down around the passengers instead of blowing directly on them, a feature that modern cars have lost.|$|E

That guy's {{going to shoot}} you." [...] According to Arnold, when Huberty pulled the trigger, [...] "nothing happened". As Huberty inspected his gun, the manager of {{the restaurant}}, 22-year-old Neva Caine, walked toward the service counter of the restaurant in the direction of Arnold, as Arnold—believing the incident to be a distasteful joke—began {{to walk away from the}} gunman. Huberty fired his shotgun <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> before aiming the Uzi at Caine, shooting her once beneath her left eye. Caine died minutes later.|$|E

40|$|Purpose : The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{existence}} of the glass ceilling in Africa; and to investigate whether organizational culture affected the perception towards the barriers of <b>the</b> glass <b>ceiling.</b> Design/Methodology : This research used a quatitative approach, based on a descriptive design. Data was gathered from surveys issued to employees at a Non-Governmental organization; with the participants based in the Sierra Leone and Democratic Republic of Congo offices. Findings : Based on the analysis of the sample, the study found the existence of <b>the</b> glass <b>ceiling.</b> However no significant relationship was found between the organizational culture and the perception towards <b>the</b> glass <b>ceiling.</b> Also no significant differences were found in perception <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> glass <b>ceiling</b> between participants located in Sierra Leone and those located in Democratic Republic of Congo. Implication of Findings : The results of the study suggest a great importance of organizational policies in unifying organizational cultures (even amidst national differences) and perceptions towards <b>the</b> glass <b>ceiling.</b> This has huge bearings on using organizational policies in shattering <b>the</b> glass <b>ceiling.</b> Originality/value : Although there have been other studies in the field, few have focused on Africa - with hardly any carrying out a comparison of participants located in two different countries but working for the same organization...|$|R
2500|$|The {{fire started}} after the curtain fell {{following}} {{the first act}} of the pantomime, when the chandelier was lifted <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> with the flame still lit. The lamp became entangled in the cords used to lift the chandelier and it touched one of the items used in the front scenes, which caught fire. As soon as the boy worker who was operating the cords saw the flames, he fled the building. The flames rose up the scenery and spread from one hanging scene to the other; there were 35 such hanging scenes which could be lowered. In addition to the hangings were also the borders that provided the outlines of buildings and skies, among other set pieces; these, too, caught fire sequentially. Pine planks (with shingles over them) fixed over rafters with no plastering and ceiling spread the flames, which fell from the ceiling and spread extremely rapidly. The impact of the fire was worsened because the stage curtain hid the initial flames from the audience.|$|E

50|$|Accelerometers {{measure the}} linear {{acceleration}} of the moving vehicle in the sensor or body frame, but in directions {{that can only be}} measured relative to the moving system (since the accelerometers are fixed to the system and rotate with the system, but are not aware of their own orientation). This {{can be thought of as}} the ability of a blindfolded passenger in a car to feel themselves pressed back into their seat as the vehicle accelerates forward or pulled forward as it slows down; and feel themselves pressed down into their seat as the vehicle accelerates up a hill or rise up out of their seat as the car passes over the crest of a hill and begins to descend. Based on this information alone, they know how the vehicle is accelerating relative to itself, that is, whether it is accelerating forward, backward, left, right, up (<b>toward</b> <b>the</b> car's <b>ceiling),</b> or down (<b>toward</b> <b>the</b> car's floor) measured relative to the car, but not the direction relative to the Earth, since they did not know what direction the car was facing relative to the Earth when they felt the accelerations.|$|R

40|$|We {{estimate}} the pricing determinants for 35, 098 payday loans originated in Colorado between 2000 and 2006, and generate {{a number of}} results with implications for public policy. We find evidence consistent with classical price competition early in the sample, but as time passed these competitive effects faded and the data become more consistent {{with a variety of}} strategic pricing practices. On average, loan prices moved upward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> legislated price <b>ceiling</b> over time, consistent with implicit collusion facilitated by price focal points. Large multi-store payday firms tended to charge higher prices than independent single-store operators, but were less likely to exploit inelastic demand near military bases and in largely minority neighborhoods. Of the three loan pricing measures used in our analysis, the annual percentage interest rate (APR) favored by regulators and analysts performed poorly. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Appropriate {{ventilation}} in {{a classroom}} is helpful for enhancing air exchange rate and student concentration. This study focuses {{on the effects of}} fenestration in a four-story school building by performing numerical simulation of a building when considering indoor and outdoor environments simultaneously. The wind profile function embedded in PHOENICS code was set as the inlet boundary condition in a suburban environment. Sixteen fenestration combinations were compared {{in a classroom}} containing thirty seats. This study evaluates mean age of air (AGE) and airflow pattern of a classroom on different floors. Considering both wind profile and fenestration effects, the airflow on higher floors is channeled <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> area near <b>ceiling</b> in a room and causes older mean age of air in the breathing zone. The results in this study serve as a useful guide for enhancing natural ventilation in a typical school building.
