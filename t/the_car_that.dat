The CIA has traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica, but has not determined its exact origin.

According to Mancera, when he was a teenager he had a car accident, where another car crashed into his, and Mancera was the passenger.

5|$|Desperate Housewives {{focuses on}} the lives of several {{residents}} in the suburban neighborhood of Wisteria Lane, as narrated by their deceased neighbor, Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong). In past episodes, a local hospital discovered that a nurse had accidentally switched two children at birth years earlier and that one of the involved families lives in town on Wisteria Lane. Bree Hodge (Marcia Cross) decided to confess to Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria) that her son, Andrew (Shawn Pyfrom), was driving <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>that</b> killed Gabrielle's mother-in-law eleven years earlier. As a result, her husband Orson (Kyle MacLachlan) decided to leave her. Susan (Teri Hatcher) and Mike Delfino (James Denton) slipped into financial crisis and decided to move into a small apartment across town. Mary Alice's husband, Paul (Mark Moses), avenged her suicide by killing her blackmailer, Martha Huber (Christine Estabrook). In response, her sister, Felicia Tilman (Harriet Sansom Harris), framed Paul for her own death and fled town. Ten years later, Paul was released from jail and returned to Wisteria Lane.|$|E
5|$|Farmer {{left school}} to tour {{with a group}} led by Johnny Otis, but this job lasted for only four months, as Farmer's lip gave out. Performing for long periods {{seven days a week}} for this job put great {{pressure}} on his technique, which was insufficiently developed to cope with such physical demands. His lip eventually became lacerated, and he could no longer play. He then received technique training in New York, where he worked for a time as a janitor and played as a freelance musician during 1947 and 1948. An audition for Dizzy Gillespie's big band was unsuccessful, and Farmer returned to the West Coast in 1948 as a member of Jay McShann's band. Club and studio work was hard to get in Los Angeles from the late 1940s and into the 1950s, as it was dominated by white musicians. Farmer played and toured with Benny Carter, Roy Porter and Gerald Wilson, then played with Wardell Gray in 1951–52. The hazards of the touring jazz musician's lifestyle were also present: while travelling overnight by car between Phoenix and El Paso, to get to another Roy Porter-led gig, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>that</b> Farmer was in overturned at high speed, leaving him concussed and Porter with broken ribs.|$|E
5|$|Padayappa {{launched}} {{production at}} the Ragavendra Kalyana Mandapam on 1 October 1998. The film's climax scene {{was one of the}} first to be shot, and was filmed in one take using two cameras. Around 2,000 extras were used for the scene. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>that</b> was used in the scene which introduced Neelambari in the film belonged to Ravikumar. Ravikumar used the newly purchased car in the film at Rajinikanth's insistence. Filming also took place in Mysore. The Vadapalani-based shop, D. V. Nehru wigs, supplied the wigs that were sported by Ganesan in the film. In an August 2016 interview with Sudhir Srinivasan of The Hindu, Ravikumar mentioned that a scene where Padayappa uses his dupatta to pull down a swing from the ceiling on which he sits after not being given a chair to sit by Neelambari, was inspired by a sequence in the Indian epic Ramayana. The sequence features the Hindu god Hanuman making a seat using his tail after Ravana, the demon king of Lanka, does not provide the former a chair to sit.|$|E

5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>that</b> had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, who think it is a joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E
5|$|Susan {{attempts}} to console Edie's husband, Dave Williams (Neal McDonough), following Edie's death. She explains the truth behind her own accident, completely unaware that Lila and Paige Dash were Dave's wife and daughter, respectively, {{and that he}} had been seeking revenge on Mike since moving to Wisteria Lane. Meanwhile, Jackson returns to Fairview and proposes to Susan, revealing that his visa has expired and he needs to marry an American citizen. When Susan learns that Mike, who is engaged to Katherine, will no longer have to pay alimony once she is married, she explains the false pretenses of her engagement. Dave, who now understands that Susan was driving <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>that</b> killed his family, overhears this and reports Jackson to immigration officials. With Jackson out of the picture, Dave invites Susan and M.J. on a fishing trip, planning to kill M.J. just like Susan killed his own child. Mike discovers Dave's plans and is able to save Susan and M.J. After the ordeal, Susan and Mike share a brief, yet romantic kiss. Dave is sent to a psychiatric hospital in Boston and two months later, Mike marries an unidentified bride.|$|E
5|$|While {{waiting in}} the church, Jackie sees Pete talking to Rose and thinks he is having an affair. Pete and Rose talk alone, and he comes to realise that she is his daughter. When Rose is unable to answer {{questions}} about how good of a father he was, Pete realises he was meant to die in the accident. Jackie thinks Rose is Pete's daughter with another woman, and in a fit of frustration Pete hands the baby Rose to adult Rose. The paradox worsens, and a Reaper is able to enter the church. The Doctor declares himself the oldest thing in the church and offers himself to the Reaper, who consumes him and disappears. The TARDIS key goes cold and drops to the ground. Pete realises that they now have no other choice and that he must die in order to restore the timeline. He bids Rose and Jackie an emotional farewell, races out of the church and throws himself under <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>that</b> was originally meant to kill him; it has continued to appear near the church. The timeline is repaired, and the Reapers' victims reappear. The Doctor sends Rose to be with her father, and she holds his hand until he dies. Rose and the Doctor walk hand-in-hand back to the restored TARDIS.|$|E
