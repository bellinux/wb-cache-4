40|$|Speed, {{the most}} {{important}} trait in trotter horses, forms the basis for examining their racing ability, and is calculated according to {{the time it takes}} to run a certain distance. The phenotypic manifestation of a horse’s speed is controlled by numerous genes and larger or smaller impacts of environmental factors. To improve <b>trotter</b> <b>horse</b> selection to be more successful and faster in genetic progress it is very important to determine the impacts of such gene-related and environmental factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of year and month of birth, sex, year and season of race, age, racetrack, distance and type of start on <b>trotter</b> <b>horse</b> racing times. Data from the Association for Trotting Sport of Serbia (UKSS) for the registered horses and races in the period from 1998 to 2010 were used. The database is comprised of data for 1263 horses over a total of 14398 races. After calculating descriptive statistics of racing times, the effect of fixed factors using the general linear model (GLM) was examined. The average racing time achieved was 84. 21 s, and ranged from 73. 8 to 132. 2 s. All of the tested factors had a statistically significant effect on the observed racing times. Thus, each of these factors should be included in future models for genetic prediction of the suitability of animals use as parents of further generations of racing trotters.

40|$|A {{genome-wide}} association {{study for}} osteochondrosis (OC) in French <b>Trotter</b> <b>horses</b> {{was carried out}} to detect QTL using genotype data from the Illumina EquineSNP 50 BeadChip assay. Analysis data came from 161 sire families of French <b>Trotter</b> <b>horses</b> with 525 progeny and family sizes ranging from 1 to 20. Genotypes were available for progeny (n = 525) and sires with at least 2 progeny (n = 98). Radiographic data were obtained from progeny using at least 10 views to reveal OC. All radiographic findings were described by at least 2 veterinary experts in equine orthopedics, and severity indices (scores) were assigned based on the size and location of the lesion. Traits used were a global score, {{the sum of all}} severity scores lesions (GM, quantitative measurement), and {{the presence or absence of}} OC on the fetlock (FM), hock (HM), and other sites (other). Data were analyzed using 2 mixed models including fixed effects, polygenic effects, and SNP or haplotype cluster effects. By combining results with both methods at moderate evidence of association threshold P < 5 × 10 − 5, this genome-wide association study displayed 1 region for GM on the Equus caballus chromosome (ECA) 13, 2 for HM on ECA 3 and 14, and 1 for other on ECA 15. One region on ECA 3 for HM represented the most significant hit (P = 3 × 10 − 6).

40|$|Lymphoma is a {{malignant}} solid neoplasm of the lymphoid tissue of unknown etiology, affecting equine species, {{unrelated to the}} age, with a prevalence ranging from 1 to 3 % of all tumoral forms. Four forms of lymphomas can be classified: generalized or multicentric, alimentary or intestinal, mediastinal or thoracic, and extranodal, The last type affects in prevalence skin, upper respiratory tract, eye and central nervous system. The {{most common type of}} lymphoma is the multicentric form. Some authors consider more common the cutaneous form, but for others it is rare.

40|$|Background: Recently, a {{mutation}} {{was discovered}} in the DMRT 3 gene that controls pacing in horses. The mutant allele A is fixed in the American Standardbred trotter breed, while in the French trotter breed, {{the frequency of the}} wild-type allele C is still 24 %. This study aimed at measuring the effect of DMRT 3 genotypes on the performance of French trotters and explaining why the polymorphism still occurs in this breed. Using a mixed animal model, genetic parameters and environmental effects on performance traits were estimated from data on 173 176 French trotter races. The effect of the DMRT 3 gene was then estimated by the effect of genotype at the highly linked SNP BIEC 2 - 620109 (C-C, A-T) for 630 horses. A selection scheme that included qualification and racing performances was modeled to (1) verify if the observed superiority of heterozygous CT horses at this SNP could be explained only by selection and (2) understand why allele C has not disappeared in French trotters. [br/] Results: Heritability of racing performance traits was high for qualification test (0. 56), moderate for annual earnings per finished race (0. 26 to 0. 31) and low for proportion of disqualified races (0. 06 to 0. 09). Genotype CC was always unfavorable compared to genotype TT for qualification: the probability to be qualified was 20 % for CC vs. 48 % for TT and earnings were - 0. 96 sigma(y) lower for CC than for TT. Genotype CT was also unfavorable for qualification (40 %) and earnings at 3 years (- 0. 21 sigma(y)), but favorable for earnings at ages greater than 5 years: + 0. 41 sigma(y) (P = 7. 10 (- 4)). Selection on qualification could not explain more than 19 % of the difference between genotypes CC and CT in earnings at ages greater than 5 years. Only a scenario for which genotype CT has a favorable effect on the performance of horses older than 5 years could explain that the polymorphism at the DMRT 3 gene still exists in the French trotter breed. [br/] Conclusions: The use of mature horses in the French racing circuit can explain that the CA genotype is still present in the French <b>trotter</b> <b>horse...</b>|$|E

In fact, during their athletic life and some of them undergo lethal lung infections, therefore it is likely that modifications of physiologic cellular parameters could account for the increased susceptibility to microbial disease. Noteworthy, chronic stress has been shown to be immunosuppressive, whereas acute stress seems to lead to immunoenhancing effects. In particular, we have studied some immune parameters as blood cells distribution, hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, phagocytosis activity, macrophage Migration Inhibiting Factor (MIF) and finally the levels of (1 - 3) -ß-D-Glucan, as indicator of clearance.

40|$|During the estrus {{cycle in}} mares the {{phenomenon}} of the so called wheel spoke structure (RSS) can be identified in sonographic images of the endometrial edema of uterine cross sections. A decrease in these RSS- phenomenon has been described in connection with ongoing ovulation. Therefore the aim of the presented clinical examination of this observation was to investigate possible interacting factors like season of the year, breed, and breeding situation of the mare. The investigations were performed in 39 clinically healthy mares of the races heavy cold blooded Schleswig breed, thoroughbred <b>trotter</b> <b>horses</b> and warm-blooded Holstein breed, under practical conditions in Schleswig- Holstein. Two different methods of evaluation have been used. On the one hand the RSS was clinically subjected and estimated in their development using a skim of notification from 0 to III. The other evaluation method consisted in the qualification of produced contrast values on freezed sonographic features from uterine cross sections. The results show a decrease in RSS- structures before the ovulation in most of the mares. Confirmed by transrectal performed palpation and sonography. In the same way the contrast values of the RSS structures dropped down 1 - 2 days before ovulation occurs. Regarding factors interfering to this phenomenon it can be noted that during springtime the RSS vanished 2 days and during summertime 1 day before ovulation. Mares with a foal examined during the estrus after the foal heat showed less clear RSS than idle mares or maidens. In these 2 latter groups the drop down in contrast values was to be recognized on day 2 before ovulation. The heavy cold-blooded Schleswig breed showed only on the day of ovulation a fading away of the RSS. In thoroughbred <b>trotter</b> <b>horses</b> a tendency of disappearance of the RSS on day - 1 before ovulation and in the warm-blooded Holstein breed on day - 2 before ovulation can be observed. The presented investigations show that the RSS dynamics during estrus cycle in mares is influenced by season, status of breeding and breed. These observations can serve for better determination of the ovulation period and therefore be used to optimise the moment of insemination and natural service. The cases of non-reacting mares with persistence in RSS- structures during the estrus period are discussed in combination with intrauterine inflammatory reactions. Finally, for determination of the optimal insemination time point it can assumed that the observation of the RSS is of likewise importance as other clinical parameters like size, form and consistency of the dominant follicle. None of the investigation criteria mentioned before is expressive enough for itself to give absolutely and reliable information about the exact ovulation time point. However, taken all criteria into account as well as changes in the RSS as presented in this clinical study these clinical parameters are helpful to predict the ovulation more precise in order to minimize the number of inseminations per estrus and to enhance the conception rate substantially...|$|R

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Right ventricular (RV) function is scarcely described in horses. Objectives: To establish reliable echocardiographic measurements of right heart size and function in horses. Study design: Descriptive study in healthy horses. Methods: Ten healthy untrained adult <b>trotter</b> <b>horses</b> underwent repeated echocardiography performed by 2 sonographers from {{right and left}} parasternal standard and nonstandard views. Nonstandard views included a right parasternal view focused on the right atrium, left parasternal long-axis pulmonary artery view, left parasternal long-axis view focused on the right ventricle including anatomical M-mode of tricuspid annular motion and left parasternal pulsed wave Doppler recording of pulmonary flow. During off-line analysis, 2 observers performed two-dimensional, M-mode, pulsed wave Doppler, tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and two-dimensional speckle tracking (2 DST) measurements of RV size and function. Acquisition and measurement variability were assessed by calculating coefficients of variation (CV) from one-way repeated measures analyses of variance. The degree of variability was classified as low (CV 25 %). Results: Most two-dimensional and M-mode measurements of RV, right atrial and pulmonary artery size showed low variability. The two-dimensional, M-mode and pulsed wave Doppler measurements of RV function showed a low to moderate variability. Right ventricular functional measurements by 2 DST showed low variability, except for segmental strain rate. Right ventricular functional measurements by TDI showed a low to high variability, with a lower variability for timing than for peak measurements and a lower variability for velocity compared with deformation measurements.
