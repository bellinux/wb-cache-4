5|$|<b>The</b> <b>balanced</b> growth {{theory is}} an {{economic}} theory pioneered by the economist Ragnar Nurkse (1907–1959). The theory hypothesises {{that the government of}} any underdeveloped country needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously. This will enlarge the market size, increase productivity, and provide an incentive for the private sector to invest.|$|E

The main finding is that <b>the</b> <b>balancing</b> item of <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> of payments in Australia is characterised by a non-linear, but stationary, series meaning that <b>the</b> <b>balancing</b> item is sustainable.

5|$|The {{most common}} method of {{controlling}} the louvers is <b>the</b> <b>balanced</b> swell pedal. This device is usually placed above {{the centre of the}} pedalboard and is configured to rotate away from the organist from a near-vertical position (in which the shades are closed) to a near-horizontal position (in which the shades are open). An organ may also have a similar-looking crescendo pedal, found alongside any expression pedals. Pressing the crescendo pedal forward cumulatively activates the stops of the organ, starting with the softest and ending with the loudest; pressing it backwards reverses this process.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{a debate}} about whether a country should {{introduce}} financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged. Nurkse believed that the subject of who should promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem. The crucial idea was that {{a large amount of}} well dispersed investment should be made in the economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question. However, {{it should be noted that}} most economists who favoured <b>the</b> <b>balanced</b> growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>balance</b> {{spring is}} a fine spiral or helical torsion spring used in {{mechanical}} watches, alarm clocks, kitchen timers, marine chronometers, and other timekeeping mechanisms to control the rate of oscillation of <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> wheel. <b>The</b> <b>balance</b> spring is an essential adjunct to <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> wheel, causing it to oscillate back and forth. <b>The</b> <b>balance</b> spring and balance wheel together form a harmonic oscillator, which oscillates with a precise period or [...] "beat" [...] resisting external disturbances, and is responsible for timekeeping accuracy.|$|R

5|$|David French {{wrote that}} the {{follow-up}} formations landing in Normandy were on average two days behind schedule and that had the 33rd Armoured Brigade, the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division and the 7th Armoured Division's infantry brigade landed on time, XXX Corps {{might have been able}} to secure Villers-Bocage, before the arrival of substantial German forces. Other historians wrote that substantial British forces remained uncommitted during the battle. Mungo Melvin wrote that although the 7th Armoured Division changed its organisation to a flexible combined arms structure, which was not done by the other British armoured divisions until after Operation Goodwood, neither the 131st Infantry Brigade nor <b>the</b> <b>balanced</b> divisional reserve of an armoured regiment and an infantry battalion were employed well.|$|E
5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity. However, <b>the</b> <b>balanced</b> growth theory involves {{the creation of a}} brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of a stable star {{is in a state}} of hydrostatic equilibrium: the forces on any small volume almost exactly counterbalance each other. <b>The</b> <b>balanced</b> forces are inward gravitational force and an outward force due to the pressure gradient within the star. The pressure gradient is established by the temperature gradient of the plasma; the outer part of the star is cooler than the core. The temperature at the core of a main sequence or giant star is at least on the order of 107 K. The resulting temperature and pressure at the hydrogen-burning core of a main sequence star are sufficient for nuclear fusion to occur and for sufficient energy to be produced to prevent further collapse of the star.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>balance</b> {{spring and}} <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> wheel (which is usually {{referred}} to as simply [...] "the balance") form a harmonic oscillator. <b>The</b> <b>balance</b> spring provides a restoring couple that limits and reverses the motion of <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> so it oscillates back and forth. The motion of <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> is approximately simple harmonic motion, i.e., a sinusoidal motion of constant period. Its resonant period makes it resistant to changes from perturbing forces, which {{is what makes it}} a good timekeeping device. The stiffness of the spring, its spring coefficient, [...] in N*m/radian, along with <b>the</b> <b>balance</b> wheel's moment of inertia, [...] in kg*m2, determines the wheel's oscillation period [...] in seconds:This period controls the rate of the timepiece.|$|R
5|$|In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton {{proposed}} a new initiative {{to provide health}} coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy—a Democrat—and Orrin Hatch—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in {{the years of the}} Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. He negotiated the passage of <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth. In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.|$|E
5|$|The 1966 Advance Party Report {{recommended}} a wholly new Progressive Training Scheme; for Cub Scouts the Bronze, Silver and Gold Arrows, for Scouts the Scout Standard, Advanced Scout Standard and Chief Scout's Award {{and for the}} new Venture Scout Section, the Venture Award and the Queen's Scout Award which focussed on long-term service and commitment {{as well as the}} completion of an expedition lasting four days and fifty miles. These changes were implemented in October 1967. From then on, the programme has been subject to regular revision; the Scout standards were replaced in 1984 by the Scout Award, Pathfinder Award and Explorer Award with a fully revised Chief Scout's Award. The Cub arrows were replaced in 1991 with the Cub Scout Award, Adventure Award and Adventure Crest Award. All these awards were replaced following the introduction of the Programme Review in February 2002. A new concept called <b>the</b> <b>Balanced</b> Programme replaced the previous scheme. Challenge Awards could be earned by participating in activities in various Programme Zones such as outdoors, fitness, community or international. Earning a certain number of Challenge Awards and the completion of a personal challenge led to the Bronze Chief Scout's Award for Beavers, Silver for Cubs and Gold for Scouts. Proficiency Badges were revised and renamed Activity Badges. In 2015, the programme was revised again following consultation within the association, the changes being called the Programme Refresh.|$|E
