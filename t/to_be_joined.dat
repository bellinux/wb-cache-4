5|$|As Ezri Tigan was {{the only}} unjoined Trill {{available}} on board, she agreed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> to the symbiont {{even though she was}} unprepared and did not previously seek <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> to one. Following the procedure, Ezri — now known as Ezri Dax — spent time at the Symbiosis Institute on Trill to learn to adapt to her new state. Because of her new state, Ezri's romantic relationship with her former boyfriend ended, as she later explained to her family that he reminded her of a past host's son.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined.</b> The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E
5|$|As for Edward II himself, his {{dependence}} on the Despensers grew only deeper, and their transgressions more severe. Lancaster's supporters (including Roger Mortimer, William Trussell and Robert de Holland) found themselves systematically accused of false charges, being imprisoned and having their lands {{taken over by the}} Despensers. Mortimer and Trussell eventually fled to Paris where they were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by Edward's estranged wife Isabella who was to become Mortimer's lover.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to gain {{increased}} support from Polish nationalists and patriots, Napoleon termed the war the Second Polish War—the First Polish War had been the Bar Confederation uprising by Polish nobles against Russia in 1768. Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> with the Duchy of Warsaw and an independent Poland created. This was rejected by Napoleon, who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen. Napoleon refused to manumit the Russian serfs because of concerns this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear. The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France's retreat.|$|E
5|$|On Russell's Top the Auckland Mounted Rifles {{were in a}} {{precarious}} position; their trenches were still far from being fully constructed, and three saps heading towards The Nek had yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> up. The 19th Division, using hand grenades, attacked the New Zealanders' position in three waves. The Wellington Mounted Rifles to the north were able to bring their machine-guns {{to bear on the}} attackers. The flanking fire caused devastation amongst the Turkish ranks. At the same time the Aucklands charged them in a counter-attack, forcing the survivors to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|The C60 {{made its}} debut at the 2000 Silverstone 500 USA Challenge, when SMG Compétition's Gary Formato and Philippe Gache used the car to take tenth place, and eighth in the LMP category.

5|$|As at Northampton, Chapman's tactics {{were based}} upon the {{principles}} of a strong defence and a fast, counter-attacking response, with the focus on quick, short passing and mazy runs from his wingers, who would pass low inside the defence instead of crossing from the byline. He had been granted control of all footballing affairs at the club and made this responsibility work to his advantage, encouraging the club's reserve and third teams to play the same style of football so that their players would function effectively in the first team if selected. He employed a wide-ranging scouting network {{to find the right}} players for his tactical system. Bolstered by the money from the cup run, Chapman was able to make further signings such as goalkeeper Ted Taylor and forward Charlie Wilson (later <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by George Cook).|$|E
5|$|On 23 September the {{regiment}} left their camp for Lyttelton and embarked on the transport ships HMNZT Tahiti and HMNZT Athenic. Leaving the same day, {{they arrived at}} Wellington the next afternoon, and disembarked the troops. On 14 October they boarded the transports again and set sail. With a short stop at Hobart, on 28 October they arrived at Albany, and anchored waiting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by the Australian contingent. The combined convoy sailed on 1 November and reached Colombo on 15 November. Two days later it sailed into the Red Sea, and the Suez Canal. Docking at Port Said on 2 December and Alexandria the next day, {{the regiment}} disembarked on 4 December and boarded a train for their camp in the Cairo suburb of Zeitoun where they started a training programme, using the desert for manoeuvres, during both day and night.|$|E
5|$|Other notable honours {{bestowed}} upon West Brom players include the PFA Young Player of the Year award, which {{was presented to}} Cyrille Regis in 1979. In 1998, Billy Bassett and Bryan Robson were named among the list of Football League 100 Legends, along with Arthur Rowley, Geoff Hurst and Johnny Giles. Bryan Robson was also an inaugural inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> two years later by Geoff Hurst. Bobby Robson, a player with Albion, has also been inducted, although this was for his achievements as a manager. In 1919–20, Fred Morris became the first Albion player to finish as top goalscorer in Division One, a feat which has since been repeated by Ronnie Allen, Derek Kevan, Jeff Astle and Tony Brown. Brown, who holds the club records for goals and appearances, was voted into the PFA Centenary Hall of Fame in July 2007.|$|E

5|$|The {{regiment}} conducted training until 24 September, {{when they}} received embarkation orders. Due to {{the fear of}} German warships being in the area, the wait for suitable escort ships delayed their departure until 15 October. With a short stop at Hobart, on 28 October they arrived at Albany, and anchored waiting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by the Australian contingent. The combined convoy sailed on 1 November and reached Colombo on 15 November. Two days later it sailed into the Red Sea and the Suez Canal.

5|$|The {{start of}} 1815 {{was to have}} seen a British {{offensive}} in the south, with the Royal Marine Battalions to advance westward into Georgia, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by Nicolls and his forces from the Gulf Coast. These plans were overtaken by events, as peace was declared following {{the conclusion of the}} Treaty of Ghent. With the offensive cancelled, Nicolls and his men returned to Prospect Bluff. On 15 March 1815, a U.S. Army aide-de-camp named Walter Bourke communicated to Major General Thomas Pinckney that conditions were difficult on the Georgia frontier despite efforts to reinforce American defences, and to negotiate the return of slaves who had joined the Corps of Colonial Marines under the command of Rear Admiral George Cockburn still at Cumberland Island. Cockburn was not inclined to voluntarily hand over British military personnel who risked being returned to slavery by the Americans, and professed difficulty in communicating news of the Treaty of Ghent to Nicolls.|$|E
5|$|There was a Royal Flying Corps {{airfield}} at Saint-Inglevert {{during the}} First World War, {{but not on}} the site of the current airfield. In April 1918, No. 21 Squadron Royal Air Force (RAF) were based at Saint-Inglevert, flying Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 aircraft. From 29 June to 23 October, No. 214 Squadron RAF were based there flying Handley Page O/400s, and in November, they were replaced by No. 115 Squadron RAF, who were flying the same type of aircraft. Two more squadrons, No. 97 Squadron RAF and No. 100 Squadron RAF, were based there from 17 November, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by two squadrons of the United States Navy in 1918, flying Sopwith Camels. All Royal Air Force squadrons departed from Saint-Inglevert on 4 March 1919.|$|E

5|$|By October 1914, many Ghadarites had {{returned}} to India and were assigned tasks like contacting Indian revolutionaries and organisations, spreading propaganda and literature, and arranging to get arms into the country. The first group of 60 Ghadarites led by Jawala Singh, left San Francisco for Canton aboard the steamship Korea on 29 August. They were to sail on to India, {{where they would be}} provided with arms to organise a revolt. At Canton, more Indians joined, and the group, now numbering about 150, sailed for Calcutta on a Japanese vessel. They were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by more Ghadarites arriving in smaller groups. During September and October, about 300 Indians left for India in various ships like SS Siberia, Chinyo Maru, China, Manchuria, SS Tenyo Maru, SS Mongolia and SS Shinyo Maru. Although the Koreas party itself was uncovered and arrested on arrival at Calcutta, a successful underground network was established between the United States and India, through Shanghai, Swatow, and Siam. Tehl Singh, the Ghadar operative in Shanghai, is believed to have spent $30,000 for helping the revolutionaries to get into India. The Ghadarites in India were able to establish contact with sympathisers within the British Indian Army as well as build networks with underground revolutionary groups.|$|E
5|$|On 19 May 1798, a French fleet {{departed}} Toulon for a {{top secret}} destination. The force consisted of 22 warships and 120 transports, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by additional forces from Genoa, Corsica and Civitavecchia {{as it passed}} south through the Ligurian Sea. The fleet's target was Egypt, a territory nominally controlled by the Ottoman Empire that French General Napoleon Bonaparte considered an ideal springboard for operations against British India. Passing southwards without interference from the Royal Navy, which had been absent from the Mediterranean {{for over a year}} following the outbreak of war between Britain and Spain, Bonaparte's convoy passed Sicily on 7 June and two days later was at anchor off the harbour of Valletta on Malta. The island nation of Malta was under the command of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, a religious order that depended on France for much of its wealth and recruits. Bonaparte believed that capturing Malta was essential to controlling the Central Mediterranean, and when Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim refused the fleet entry to the harbour, Bonaparte responded with a large scale invasion. The knights put up no resistance, although fighting against native Maltese troops lasted for 24 hours until the central city of Mdina fell. With this defeat the knights withdrew to their fortress at Valletta but were persuaded to surrender the following day with promises of pensions and estates in France.|$|E
5|$|On 8 February 1915, the Australian {{government}} {{received a}} request from the British Government of India for aerial assistance in the campaign against the Turks in Mesopotamia. Aircrew and supporting personnel for half a flight only were available so the unit, the AFC's first to see active service, {{became known as the}} Mesopotamian Half Flight. Promoted to captain, Petre was appointed the Half Flight's commanding officer and embarked for Basra via Bombay on 14April, later <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by fellow pilots White, Merz and Lieutenant William Treloar, along with thirty-seven ground staff. In Mesopotamia, Petre was required to lead the AFC contingent in reconnaissance and sabotage missions, and had to deal with unreliable machines, hazardous terrain, and the threat of incarceration or death at the hands of hostile tribesmen. He took part in operations in the Amara area from 31May to 4June, for which he was mentioned in despatches. The obsolete aircraft supplied by the Indian Government, two Maurice Farman Shorthorns and a Maurice Farman Longhorn, were only capable of top speeds of 50mph (80km/h), while the desert wind (known as the shamal) could reach 80mph (129km/h), meaning that the aircraft often made no headway or were simply blown backwards. In July, the Half Flight's equipment was augmented by two Caudron G.3 aircraft, a marginal improvement on the Farmans, but still prone to mechanical failure. Later that month, one of the Caudrons was forced to land in enemy territory. Its crew, Merz and a New Zealander, were never seen again; they were later reported killed by Arabs after a running gun battle over several miles.|$|E

5|$|The {{tactical}} plan included coordinated strikes on Axis airfields {{carried out by}} Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress groups to tie down Axis fighter groups. Medium bomber units operating the North American B-25 Mitchell would fly sweeps over the Gulf of Tunis. They were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>joined</b> by Lockheed P-38 Lightning heavy fighters which were also detailed to sweep the area. The presence of the B-25s would allow the P-38s {{to operate in the}} area without raising the Axis suspicions. It would seem as if they were there to escort the B-25s, rather than their actual intention, to interdict Axis air transports. Supermarine Spitfire units would sweep the straits further north, catching any enemy aircraft that evaded the P-38s. More B-25 and B-17 units were detailed to strike at Sicilian airfields to catch transports on the ground. The USAAF 9th Air Force was detailed to send its Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomb groups against airfields in and around Naples in this capacity as well. On 2 April Doolittle's superiors, supreme commander of all Allied Air Forces in the Mediterranean, Arthur Tedder and commander of Allied Air Forces in Western North Arica Carl Spaatz, decided to wait for the next suitable window to launch the offensive.|$|E
