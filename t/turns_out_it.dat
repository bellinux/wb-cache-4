When {{the upper and}} lower walls are maintained at different temperatures, the velocity profile is complicated, but it <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> has an exact implicit solution.|$|E
5|$|Carly Beth Caldwell is a naive, timid and gullible 11-year-old {{girl who}} is afraid of pretty much everything. Thus, she is a {{constant}} target for pranks, jokes and tricks, most of them being inflicted on her by Steve Boswell and Chuck Greene at Walnut Avenue Middle School. In the opening chapter, Carly Beth and Sabrina discuss what costumes {{they are going to}} wear for Halloween, and Carly Beth is tricked by Steve into eating a sandwich containing a live worm. Horrified, Carly Beth flees and vows revenge. After school, she goes home and finds her mother has made her a silly duck costume for Halloween, and also a very realistic plaster of Paris model of Carly Beth's head. When she goes to her room, the duck costume seemingly comes alive and attacks Carly Beth. It <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> is her younger brother, Noah, playing another trick on her. Sabrina calls, and they discuss the school science fair.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, {{the group}} {{sets out to}} {{retrieve}} the ring, which is at a cabin in the valley, which Everett earlier claimed was the location of his treasure. The police, having learned of the place from Pete, arrest the group. Dismissing their claims of receiving pardons, Sheriff Cooley orders them hanged. Just as Everett prays to God, the valley is flooded and they are saved. Tommy finds the ring in a desk that floats by, and they return to town. However, when Everett presents the ring to Penny, it <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> wasn't her ring, and she doesn't even remember where she put it.|$|E

25|$|The game {{opened up}} with a bang for the Hawkeyes, as C.J. Jones took the opening kickoff 100-yards for the touchdown. But as it <b>turns</b> <b>out,</b> <b>it</b> {{would be the only}} time until late in the fourth quarter that the Hawkeyes would see the endzone. Although the game was tied at halftime, USC blocked Iowa's last-second field goal, {{preventing}} a possible Iowa lead at the half. From there, Heisman winner Carson Palmer went to work. The senior quarterback threw for over 300 yards against the Big Ten's worst passing defense and led scoring drives of 79, 80, 99, 85 and 61 yards as the Trojans held a 16-minute advantage in time of possession. The USC defense was suffocating and Iowa's miscues were proof. The Hawkeyes had two turnovers, 13 penalties, and multiple missed opportunities.|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} season's use of 1940s terminology, Fazekas stated that terms like [...] "broad" [...] and [...] "dame" [...] were preferably avoided, while {{research}} {{was done to}} ensure terms {{that were used in}} the series were actually in use during that time, with Fazekas giving the example, [...] "you know what didn't exist in 1946? Smart ass. I looked up the etymology on that, didn't exist in 1946. <b>Turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>it</b> was a term that came around in the 60s. But for instance, I wrote a line that said, [...] "Oh I think someone's yanking your chain." [...] And I had to look it up, did that exist in 1946? And actually it did; it's a mining term that exists from a long time ago. That's our research that we do." [...] Research was also done on radio shows of the time to ensure realism when creating the fictional Captain America Adventure Program, with details discovered and replicated on the series including the use of lobsters and ham to create sound effects for the radio show. The Griffith Hotel, the all-women boarding house where Carter lives, is based on the real-life Barbizon Hotel for Women. Butters felt that while working in the time period, it became an issue to not sound [...] "too period". Additionally, it was difficult to write British people from the time in order to avoid stereotypes such as the [...] "typical British butler". However, D'Arcy, who is British, felt the writing staff wrote the British characters better than anyone else he had worked with, despite there not being any British writers on the staff.|$|E
