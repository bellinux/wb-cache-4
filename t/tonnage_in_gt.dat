40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: A {{combination}} of pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin (PR) {{is the standard}} therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis C. The impact of polymorphism of interleukin- 28 B (IL 28 B) on sustained virological response (SVR) to PR {{has been well documented}} in patients with CHC genotype- 1 (GT 1), but it is controversial <b>in</b> genotype- 2 (<b>GT</b> 2) CHC patients. This study investigated the predictability of six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of IL 28 B on the treatment responses of PR in patients with CHC GT 2. METHOD: 197 CHC GT 2 consecutive patients who received PR treatment in our prospective cohort were enrolled. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotyping, quantification of HCV-RNA and genotyping of the ten SNPs of IL 28 B were performed. Six SNPs of IL 28 B were chosen for analysis. The propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was applied using patients with CHC <b>GT</b> 1 <b>in</b> another prospective cohort as a positive comparison to avoid covariate bias. RESULTS: The distribution of the six SNPs was similar <b>in</b> <b>GT</b> 1 and GT 2 patients. Five of these SNPs had strong association with treatment responses <b>in</b> <b>GT</b> 1 but not <b>in</b> <b>GT</b> 2 patients. After PSM analysis, these five SNPs still showed strong association with rapid virological response (RVR), cEVR and SVR <b>in</b> <b>GT</b> 1 and had no influence <b>in</b> <b>GT</b> 2 patients. Furthermore, rs 12979860 and baseline viral load were the predictors for both RVR and SVR <b>in</b> <b>GT</b> 1 patients. However, only baseline viral load could predict RVR and SVR <b>in</b> <b>GT</b> 2 patients. <b>In</b> addition, in patients without RVR, rs 12979860 was the only predictor for SVR <b>in</b> <b>GT</b> 1 but no predictor for SVR was found <b>in</b> <b>GT</b> 2.

40|$|Glucose {{transporter}} protein type 1 (GLUT 1) {{is a major}} glucose transporter of the fertilized egg and preimplantation embryo. Haploinsufficiency for GLUT 1 causes the GLUT 1 deficiency syndrome in humans, however the embryo appears unaffected. Therefore, here we produced heterozygous GLUT 1 knockout murine embryonic stem cells (GT 1 +/−) to study the role of GLUT 1 deficiency in their growth, glucose metabolism, and survival in response to hypoxic stress. GT 1 (−/−) cells were determined to be nonviable. Both the GLUT 1 and GLUT 3 high-affinity, facilitative glucose transporters were expressed <b>in</b> <b>GT</b> 1 (+/+) and GT 1 (+/−) embryonic stem cells. GT 1 (+/−) demonstrated 49 ± 4 % reduction of GLUT 1 mRNA. This induced a posttranscriptional, GLUT 1 compensatory response resulting in 24 ± 4 % reduction of GLUT 1 protein. GLUT 3 was unchanged. GLUT 8 and GLUT 12 were also expressed and unchanged <b>in</b> <b>GT</b> 1 (+/−). Stimulation of glycolysis by azide inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation was impaired by 44 % <b>in</b> <b>GT</b> 1 (+/−), with impaired up-regulation of GLUT 1 protein. Hypoxia for up to 4 hours led to 201 % more apoptosis <b>in</b> <b>GT</b> 1 (+/−) than <b>in</b> <b>GT</b> 1 (+/+) controls. Caspase- 3 activity was 76 % higher <b>in</b> <b>GT</b> 1 (+/−) versus GT 1 (+/+) at 2 hours. Heterozygous knockout of GLUT 1 led to a partial GLUT 1 compensatory response protecting nonstressed cells. However, inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation and hypoxia both exposed their increased susceptibility to these stresses...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{responses}} to more favourable dry-bulk cargo market conditions has been {{the extension of the}} commercial life of Capesize vessels. It is argued here that in assessing the seaworthiness of such vessels the cardinal factor is age. Regulations have been instituted in an attempt to ensure those vessels deemed to be unsafe are denied the opportunity to trade. The central premise of this discussion is of the uneven manner, internationally, in which these regulations have been and are enforced. The proof of this lies, as the analysis highlights, in the recent greater concentration of comparatively modern <b>tonnage</b> <b>in</b> certain regional trades as against the congregating of ageing <b>tonnage</b> <b>in</b> others. ...|$|R
