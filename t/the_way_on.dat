5|$|But the Three Leagues {{had already}} called upon the Swiss {{for help and}} troops from Uri had already arrived in Chur. Upon {{learning}} about the truce, they withdrew, but met a small troop of Habsburg soldiers {{on their way back}} home. When those engaged in the usual insults on the Swiss, the latter crossed the Rhine and killed the scoffers. In retaliation, Habsburg troops sacked the village of Maienfeld on February 7 and called the Swabian League for help. Only five days later, Swiss troops from several cantons had been assembled and reconquered the village and moved towards Lake Constance, pillaging and plundering along <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>On</b> February 20, they again met a Habsburg army, which they defeated in the battle of Hard on the shores of Lake Constance near the estuary of the Rhine, and at about the same time, other Swiss troops invaded the Hegau region between Schaffhausen and Constance. On both sites, the Swiss retreated after a few days.|$|E
5|$|Diving at Wookey resumed {{in early}} June 1946 when Balcombe used his {{homemade}} respirator and waterproof suit {{to explore the}} region between the resurgence and first chamber, {{as well as the}} underground course of the river between the third and first chambers. During these dives, the Romano-British remains were found and archaeological work dominated the early dives in the cave. The large ninth chamber was first entered on 24 April 1948 by Balcombe and Don Coase. Using this as an advance dive base, the 10th and then 11th chambers were discovered. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>on,</b> however, was too deep for divers breathing pure oxygen from a closed-circuit rebreather. The cave claimed its first life on 9 April 1949 when Gordon Marriott lost his life returning from the ninth chamber. Another fatality was to occur in 1981 when Keith Potter was drowned on a routine dive further upstream.|$|E

Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, in the Mariana Islands, about six hours' flight time from Japan, accompanied by two other B-29s, The Great Artiste, carrying instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called Necessary Evil, commanded by Captain George Marquardt, to take photographs. The director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted the event recorded for posterity, so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights.

In 1946, while still a student, Tuyến came to know the Ngô family by chance. His future mentor Ngô Đình Nhu wanted to travel from Hanoi to a Catholic area near the border with Laos and needed a guide.

25|$|With Zoey {{forced to}} kill him, the {{helicopter}} crash lands {{in an industrial}} district outside the city. Finding an armored delivery truck, the group uses it {{to make their way}} to the town of Riverside. However, they find the road blocked, and travel the rest of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>on</b> foot. After an encounter with an infected lunatic in the local church, they discover that the town is overrun, and decide to head to a nearby boathouse for rescue. Contacting a small fishing vessel, they manage to reach the city of Newburg on the other side of the river, only to find much of it in flames. Seeking cover in a large greenhouse, their rest is interrupted when a military C-130 Hercules passes overhead, leading the survivors to travel through the city's business district towards Metro International Airport. Upon arrival, the group see that in an attempt to contain the infection, the military had bombed the airport while infected pilots crash planes in an attempt to land; the runway however is largely intact, allowing the survivors to fuel up and escape in a waiting C-130.|$|E
25|$|In February 1801 Mansel sailed Penguin for the Cape of Good Hope. On <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>on</b> 18 February, Penguin {{engaged in}} an {{inconclusive}} engagement with three unidentified French ships near the Canary Islands. The three consisted of a corvette of 24 guns, and two privateers, each of 18 guns. Mansel sailed to meet the three and in the subsequent engagement managed to cause the corvette to strike her colours. However, {{he was unable to}} take possession as the other two French vessels continue firing. Eventually they succeeded in causing great damage to Penguins rigging, essentially crippling her. By this time it was dark, and though Mansel and his crew stood ready to fight off boarders, the French took the opportunity to sail off. The crew worked to effect repairs and in the morning Penguin attempted to follow the French vessels, but was unable to prevent them reaching Teneriffe. In the engagement Penguin had several men wounded. The day after the engagement, Penguin detained a Swedish East Indiaman, which then carried his letter describing the action. A later account suggests one of the wounded men may have died subsequently.|$|E

25|$|Averaging {{more than}} 30 {{points per game}} every season, Galis was the indisputable leader of Aris. Playing {{alongside}} other great players at Aris such as Panagiotis Giannakis and Slobodan Subotić (who was known in Greece as Lefteris Soumpotits), Galis won 8 Greek League championships (7 of them consecutively, and 3 undefeated, in the years 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991), 6 Greek Cups (4 of them consecutively, in the years 1985, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1992), and led Aris to 3 consecutive appearances at the FIBA European Champions' Cup Final Four ('88, '89, and '90). In the one disappointment of an otherwise glittering career with Aris, all three FIBAEuropean Champions' Cup appearances ended in defeat in the semifinals, thus depriving Galis {{of the opportunity to}} shine all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>on</b> Europe's biggest club, stage at the FIBA European Champions' Cup Finals. The team's performances and general standard of play, however, won the heart of most every basketball fan in Greece. Indeed, cinemas and theaters would often reduce their admission prices on Thursday evenings, when Aris was playing, and the entire country settled down to watch them on television.|$|E
25|$|When Kishi {{submitted}} the treaty to the Diet for ratification on 19 May 1960, such were the demonstrations against the treaty that 500 policemen had to assembled outside the Diet while Kishi made the treaty a confidence vote in his government, thereby forcing the LDP Dietmen {{to vote for}} the treaty if they did not want the government to fall. On June 10, White House Press Secretary James Hagerty arrived in preparation for a state visit of President Dwight Eisenhower. He was met at the airport by Ambassador Douglas MacArthur II. Knowing that leftist demonstrators lined the road from the airport they chose to travel by car rather than helicopter. They felt that if the demonstrators were going to resort to violence {{it would be better for}} both the US and Japanese governments to know rather than waiting to test their resolve at the arrival of the President. They also believed that if any violence ensued it would bias the Japanese populace against the demonstrators. As they approached the exit to the airport grounds a mob spearheaded by Zengakuren students closed in stoning the car, shattering windows, slashing tires, and trying to overturn them. Police reached them after 15 minutes and managed to clear a landing zone for a helicopter which transported them the rest of <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>On</b> 15 June 1960 a university student protesting against the treaty outside the Diet was killed by the police, which led to the largest demonstrations ever in Japanese history, both against police brutality and the treaty. To his embarrassment, Kishi had to request the postponement of Eisenhower's state visit. The end of Eisenhower's term of office prevented it from being rescheduled. The loss of face this entailed, along with his apparent inability to restrain the demonstrations resulted in factional disputes within the Liberal Democratic Party. The Emperor had wanted to greet President Eisenhower when he landed in Japan, and was displeased about the cancellation of the president's trip, which for a politician like Kishi who had wanted to restore to the Emperor his political powers was highly embarrassing. Kishi had the treaty ratified, but he had used up so much political capital and his government had become so unpopular that all the LDP fractions united to demand that he resign. Kishi's plans to repeal Article 9 of the constitution were even more unpopular than the security treaty, and given the extent of popular opposition to the security treaty, to attempt to repeal Article 9 as Kishi wanted was seen as political suicide within the LDP. In April 1960, across the Korea straits, the South Korean president Syngman Rhee was overthrown in the April Revolution-which was led by protesting university students-and at the time, there was serious fears in Japan that protests led by university students against the Kishi government might likewise lead to a revolution, making it imperative to ditch the very unpopular Kishi. On 15 July 1960 Kishi resigned and Hayato Ikeda became prime minister.|$|E
25|$|The Barrie Colts {{would begin}} the season without the {{previous}} season's top scorers Tanner Pearson and Ivan Telegin who would play {{the season in}} the AHL. Overage defenceman Ryan O'Connor was named team captain. With the likes of Mark Scheifele, Anthony Camara, Steven Beyers, Zach Hall, and former London Knight Andreas Athanasiou, the Colts would continue to pack an offensive punch. Leading <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>on</b> defence were returnees Alex Yuill, Johnathan Laser, Aaron Ekblad, and Alex Lepkowski. Overager Mathias Neiderberger was stellar all year in goal. With this crop of experienced players, {{as well as a}} handful of rookies to fill in the gaps, the Colts would quickly take the top spot in the Eastern Conference; a position they would hold {{for the majority of the}} season. The Colts would also be ranked amongst the CHL Top Ten teams for most of the year as well. Throughout the season, many Colts would say goodbye through trades. Included in this group were Brendan Bell, Sammu Markula, Dylan Smoskowitz, and the Colts 2012 first round draft pick Brendan Perlini. In exchange they would receive many draft picks as well as defencman Jake Dotchin, and forwards Devon Rymarchuk, and Mitchell Theoret in the hopes that the Colts could make a run deep into the playoffs. Over the Christmas Break, sophomore defenceman Aaron Ekblad would captain Team Ontario's Under 17 squad, and both Anthony Camara, and Mark Scheifele would make Team Canada's Under 20 team. Scheifele would soon after be recalled to the NHL after the lockout was settled. He would remain with the Winnipeg Jets until early February when he was returned to the OHL. The Colts would lock down the 2nd place seed in the Eastern Conference heading into the playoffs. After quickly beating the 7th seed Kingston Frontenacs and 3rd seed Oshawa Generals 4 games to 0 a piece, the Colts would meet the first place Belleville Bulls in the conference finals. The Colts would need 7 games to beat Belleville for a trip to the OHL Championships. No one gave the Colts a chance at winning this series as they would play the defending champions London Knights. After 4 games, the Colts would lead the series 3 games to 1. At this point, injuries to Mark Scheifele and suspensions (10 games for Ryan O'Connor, 5 games for Anthony Camara, and 5 games for Jake Dotchin) would catch up with the Colts. London would win game 5 at home and game 6 in Barrie in thrilling fashion. In game 6 London would hold a 4–0 lead with just over 10 minutes left in the third period. The Colts stormed back to score 4 goals before losing in overtime. In game 7 Barrie headed back to London where the game was tied 2–2 in the dying seconds of the third period. A miscommunication between the Colts players led to a turnover, and a London goal with 0.1 seconds remaining on the clock to deny the Colts a trip to the Memorial Cup. To add insult to injury, London was awarded the 2014 Memorial Cup early the next day; a tournament that Barrie also had a solid bid for.|$|E
