He invited ecclesiastical dignitaries from the capital to teach those monks and brought them back in line with the main teachings of Buddhism.

25|$|With Alec Bedser and the spinners {{doing most of}} {{the work}} against South Africa in 1951, Statham had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>very</b> little in the Tests, but he only missed 100 {{first-class}} wickets due to injury and showed himself a formidable bowler on a pitch offering help. In India, his average was good, but the heat and humidity certainly seemed to take their toll upon his body and he did little in the Tests, with the result that he was not chosen for a Test match in 1952 even though he was gaining speed and straightness and was often extremely formidable despite conditions rarely favouring bowlers. In 1953, Statham was within a whisker of heading the first-class averages and bowled wonderfully on the most placid of pitches against Hampshire, but Bedser ensured he was not needed in the Ashes Tests. Statham and fellow fast-bowler Fred Trueman were on occasion, in 1953, called up to the Test squad, but with the England team maturing, the captain, Len Hutton did not feel comfortable playing two fast-bowlers, often preferring the more economical, slower bowling of Alec Bedser and Trevor Bailey. This meant that Statham and Trueman rarely bowled in tandem in this period.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{publication}} of Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home, Sheldrake invited Richard Wiseman, Matthew Smith, and Julie Milton to conduct an independent experimental study with the dog Jaytee. They concluded that their evidence did not support telepathy as {{an explanation for the}} dog's behaviour, and proposed possible alternative explanations for Sheldrake's conclusions, involving artefacts, bias resulting from experimental design, and post hoc analysis of unpublished data. The group observed that Sheldrake's observed patterns could easily arise if a dog were simply <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>very</b> little for a while, before visiting a window with increasing frequency the longer that its owner was absent, and that such behaviour would make sense for a dog awaiting its owner's return. Under this behaviour, the final measurement period, ending with the owner's return, would always contain the most time spent at the window. Sheldrake argued that the actual data in his own and in Wiseman's tests did not bear this out, and that the dog went to wait at the window sooner when his owner was returning from a short absence, and later after a long absence, with no tendency for Jaytee to go to the window early in the way that he did for shorter absences.|$|E

[...] Cruft overhauled the bookkeeping in the shop, changing it from a system using crosses to distinguish between wholesale and retail customers to a far more detailed system.

500|$|To {{carry out}} photosynthesis, cactus stems have {{undergone}} many adaptations. Early in their evolutionary history, {{the ancestors of}} modern cacti (other than one group of Pereskia species) developed stomata on their stems and began to delay developing bark. However, this alone was not sufficient; cacti with only these adaptations appear <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>very</b> little photosynthesis in their stems. Stems needed to develop structures similar to those normally found only in leaves. Immediately below the outer epidermis, a hypodermal layer developed made up of cells with thickened walls, offering mechanical support. Air spaces were needed between the cells to allow carbon dioxide to diffuse inwards. The center of the stem, the cortex, developed [...] "chlorenchyma" [...] – a plant tissue made up of relatively unspecialized cells containing chloroplasts, arranged into a [...] "spongy layer" [...] and a [...] "palisade layer" [...] {{where most of the}} photosynthesis occurs.|$|E

[...] In the liner notes of the album's 20th anniversary edition, music journalist Kory Grow wrote that [...] "thanks to a perfect balance of hard-rock song structures, epic choruses, and fleet-fingered guitar work, Countdown to Extinction became an instant classic, benefiting from copious MTV and radio play." [...] Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a [...] "seminal" [...] release and commented that it [...] "changed the game by preserving the band's thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess, while dropping some of the biggest hooks the genre had ever seen". In a retrospective review of the album, Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that Countdown to Extinctions [...] "status as a gateway metal album is indisputable" [...] and its [...] "popularity speaks volumes about its significance in the metal canon".|$|E

In its second weekend it grossed $8,117,459 and ranked fourth at the box office. The film closed its run on August 1, 2008 with $43,945,766 domestically and $93,945,766 worldwide. Based on its total gross, it was considered a box office bomb. The results were well below studio expectations, given that the production costs of Speed Racer were estimated to be over $120 million. Despite the low box office numbers, Warner Bros. remained optimistic about sales of associated products ranging from toys to tennis shoes. Brad Globe, president of Warner Bros.

Paul Merson scored twice against Middlesbrough as Arsenal recorded a 3–0 win and moved into second place, just two points behind Norwich City. Arsenal's five England internationals, who featured against Saudi Arabia a week before, were lauded in The Times for their performances, despite playing tamely for country. The match reporter suggested the club versus country dilemma could be solved by including more Arsenal players, something Graham was sceptical about when put to him. [...] "I want England <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>very</b> well. It's just I want Arsenal to do better," [...] he said.

500|$|... "Take a Bow" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Upon the song's release {{as an official}} single, Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented its choice {{for the promotion of}} Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, writing that the singer could have chosen [...] "Breakin' Dishes" [...] which served as a promotional single for Good Girl Gone Bad and charted at number four on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart in February 2008—but had opted for [...] "Take a Bow" [...] due to it being new and more likely to find a receptive audience. Levine continued in his review to write that although the ballad succeeds in its mission of telling of a failed relationship, he noted that the song was not at the same level as the singer's previous single, [...] "Don't Stop the Music" [...] (2007). Levine cited that his reason for this was that [...] "'Take a Bow' does what it sets out <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>very</b> well, but it's an underwhelming follow-up to the dancefloor rush of 'Don't Stop The Music". Levine also commented on the song with regard to the other new songs included on the re-release, [...] "Disturbia" [...] and [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again" [...] (a collaboration with Maroon 5), as part of his review of Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded, writing that [...] "Take a Bow" [...] is inferior to the former, but superior to the latter.

Dimitri sees this as another {{chance to have a}} family with Erica and wants to be a father to Sonya. Erica refuses to let him be a part of either of their lives. This makes Dimitri so angry he begins checking into Sonya's adoption. Tad Martin and Gloria Marsh are also looking into it. Losing Erica leads Dimitri <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>very</b> cruel things such as conning mentally challenged Stuart Chandler out of his television station, WRCW, in an attempt to get back at Erica for leaving him.

While in a rage he accidentally hits Erica and baby Sonya with his car. Sonya is taken to the hospital where Maria gives her a check up and feels a connection with her. Eventually, Erica returns Sonya to Maria and is sent to prison for kidnapping. Maria is presumed dead not long afterward, leading to a custody battle between Dimitri and Edmund over the baby, now named Maddie Grey. Dimitri is awarded custody after a few dirty tricks such as drugging Edmund so he will look like an unfit parent.
