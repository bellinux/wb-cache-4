Reading 'Illuminations' 41 (2011), So's scenario for 4 audio cassettes and two readers using John Ashbery's new English translation of Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations, was commissioned for the 2011 AxS Festival and premiered by So and Julia Holter in October 2011 at Pasadena's Art Center College of Design. The <b>tape</b> <b>components</b> of this piece were later released on a cassette from Recondite Industries in 2012, paired with So's keyboard notebook A Book of Palms. In October 2012, So performed his piece Into Silence - readings 23 John Cage (2007), a 6 hour, 15 minute solo reading, during the John Cage Festival at the Florida State University, situated among three tape sources playing through a total of nine cassettes. This scenario expanded to four tape sources and 15 tapes when So next performed Into Silence at Michael Strogoff Gallery in Marfa, TX, in June 2013. Between these events, he collaborated with composer Michael Winter on a performance at the wulf. during morning twilight of March 31, 2013, in which Winter's minor third abstract (2011) for solo piano slowly {{gave way to a}} two-channel realization of So's tape though we haven't read it, we know there is a script End of New England” by Eileen Myles readings 44 (2012).

40|$|We {{discuss some}} of the main {{considerations}} involved in the design of HTS coils to operate in liquid nitrogen and provide ampere-turns for magnetic circuits in general, and then in particular for a small-scale electromagnetic (i. e. attractive) maglev demonstrator. The most important factor affecting design is the sensitive and strongly anisotropic dependence of HTS tape's critical current on magnetic field. Any successful design must limit the field in the windings, especially components perpendicular to the <b>tape's</b> surface(radial <b>components</b> in the case of solenoids), to acceptably low levels such that local critical currents nowhere fall below the operating current. This factor is relevant to the construction of HTS coils for all applications. A second important factor is that the presence of an iron magnetic circuit can greatly alter the flux distribution within the coils from that found when they are in free space. FE modelling has been used to calculate accurate field profiles in proposed designs for comparison with short sample I-c(B) data. We present a design for a maglev demonstrator, illustrating how {{some of the}} problems, in particular the reduction of radial field components, may be addressed, and describe its predicted performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of lateral tape motion (LTM) in tape drives {{is a key}} requirement for improved performance of tape drives since read/write errors are likely to occur if lateral tape motion exceeds {{ten percent of the}} track width of the recorded magnetic signal. Lateral tape motion is a function of tape path and tape properties, mechanical design parameters such as speed and tension, and friction between tape and <b>tape</b> path <b>components.</b> This investigation deals with the effect of friction on LTM for a tape moving over the surface of a cylindrical guide. The effect of friction and mechanical design parameters on LTM is investigated numerically. The equation of motion for a moving tape on a cylindrical guide surface is determined and the effects of friction and design parameters are examined by calculating the ratio of LTM before and after a cylindrical guide. Keeping the tape velocity and guide radius constant, attenuation of the LTM signal is seen to occur for all frequency components of the signal. Attenuation of LTM is found to increase with increasing friction and roller radius. Increasing tape tension reduces LTM while keeping the friction coefficient constant. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{findings}} {{of research on}} the effectiveness of ankle taping for protection against ligament injury have been inconsistent, and the topic remains controversial. The precise orientation of the force vectors created by tension within the various <b>tape</b> strip <b>components</b> of an ankle taping procedure may be a critical factor influencing the degree of motion restraint that is provided. We hypothesized that the addition of the subtalar sling component to the widely recognized standard (Gibney) ankle taping procedure would enhance restraint of ankle motion. This was a controlled laboratory study, with fully repeated measures (subjects served as their own controls). Methods: An ankle arthrometer was used to quantify anteroposterior (AP) translation and frontal plane inversion-eversion (I-E) tilt of the talocrural-subtalar joints under untaped and taped conditions in normal subjects. A 15 -minute exercise session was conducted to loosen the tape before measurement of its effect on motion restraint. Results: The ankle taping procedure that incorporated the subtalar sling provided significantly greater restriction of postexercise AP translation (p < 0. 001, η 2 = 0. 63) and postexercise I-E tilt (p < 0. 001, η 2 = 0. 66). Conclusions: The subtalar sling ankle taping procedure provides greater restriction of motions associated with ankle instability than the more widely used Gibney procedure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{dispersion}} equation for {{electromagnetic waves}} guided by an open tape helix {{for the standard}} model of an infinitesimally thin and perfectly conducting tape is derived from an exact solution of a homogeneous boundary value problem for Maxwell’s equations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Poor {{counting}} {{and number}} identification {{in early childhood}} adulthood {{is associated with a}} wide range of negative adult outcomes. Despite the large amount of research showing a relationship between mathematics and inhibitory control, no intervention studies were found that included inhibition training as part of the numeracy instruction strategy. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an audio taped counting and number identification intervention (Taped Numbers) and inhibitory control training (Inhibition Feedback) on counting and number identification in Aotearoa/New Zealand children in their first year of school. METHOD: This study employed an across participants multiple baseline design. Participants were six children in their first year of school from a primary school in Christchurch, Aotearoa/New Zealand who were nominated by their teacher as likely to benefit from a counting and number identification intervention. Taped Numbers used an audio-delivered task-based feedback strategy and Inhibition Feedback used an instructor-delivered task-based feedback strategy. RESULTS: Visual analysis of the data revealed that the <b>Taped</b> Numbers <b>component</b> of the intervention was moderately effective with two out of four replications for counting and three out of five replications for number identification. Extended Line Celeraton (ECL) analysis indicated large effect sizes for participants that made gains. DISCUSSION: Although both Taped Numbers and Inhibition Feedback were effective, no relationship could be established between gains in inhibitory control and gains in counting and number identification. The results are also discussed in relation to the current literature on counting and number identification interventions in early primary school. The practical implications of the findings are discussed as are recommendations for future research...|$|R
40|$|For {{high current}} superconductors in high magnet fields with {{currents}} {{in the order}} of 50 kA, single ReBCO coated conductors must be assembled in a cable. The geometry of such a cable is mostly such that combined torsion, axial and transverse loading states are anticipated in the tapes and tape joints. The resulting strain distribution, caused by different thermal contraction and electromagnetic forces, will affect the critical current of the tapes. Tape performance when subjected to torsion, tensile and transverse loading is the key to understanding limitations for the composite cable performance. The individual <b>tape</b> material <b>components</b> can be deformed, not only elastically but also plastically under these loads. A set of experimental setups, as well as a convenient and accurate method of stress–strain state modeling based on the finite element method have been developed. Systematic measurements on single ReBCO tapes are carried out combining axial tension and torsion as well as transverse loading. Then the behavior of a single tape subjected to the various applied loads is simulated in the model. This paper presents the results of experimental tests and detailed FE modeling of the 3 D stress–strain state in a single ReBCO tape under different loads, taking into account the temperature dependence and the elastic-plastic properties of the tape materials, starting from the initial tape processing conditions during its manufacture up to magnet operating conditions. Furthermore a comparison of the simulations with experiments is presented with special attention for the critical force, the threshold where the tape performance becomes irreversibly degraded. We verified the influence of tape surface profile non-uniformity and copper stabilizer thickness on the critical force. The FE models appear to describe the tape experiments adequately and can thus be used as a solid basis for optimization of various cabling concepts...|$|R
40|$|Inflatables have {{considerable}} packing efficiencies and allow simple deployment. This {{is due to}} their lack of stiffness when deflated, offering low cost solutions for space applications. After inflation, these typically soft systems could be improved using tape springs as structural stiffeners {{along the length of}} the boom, creating hybrid structures. These simple low cost single element components are easily stowed gaining strain energy in their collapsed state without permanent deformation providing additional potential to drive boom deployment. Combining both inflatable and <b>tape</b> spring <b>components</b> could create a superior hybrid boom with significant structural performance, whilst maintaining the advantages of gossamer structures. This research focuses on the structural performance improvement of adding tape springs to cantilever inflatable booms in over 40 experimental permutations. Applied tip loads identify the deflection response of these inflatable and hybrid booms, allowing a comparison between the two technologies. A computational hybrid boom model is developed alongside the experimental analysis using detailed material testing data of the inflatable fabric boom allowing an increased range of permutations and greater detail. The structural analysis has demonstrated the performance flexibility of hybrid booms where specific peak moment and rigidity requirements can be tailored through two key configurations; 2 opposed tape springs vertically aligned to the applied load and 4 tape springs in a cross formation square to the applied load respectively. A performance evaluation between the inflatable and hybrid booms shows significant potential whilst reducing the operational importance of maintaining pressurised systems. The greatest structural performance improvement is at 2. 5 PSI with an increase of over 8 and 10 times for peak moment and boom rigidity respectively. This is achieved when adding 4 tapes in a cross formation to the inflatable boom with an added mass of 105 %. This research has also highlighted the importance of the attachment method between the tape springs and inflatable boom with respect to packing efficiency, parasitic mass and structural performance trade offs...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} {{goal of this}} Phase II Superconductivity Partnership Initiative {{project was}} to build and operate a prototype Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) system using high temperature superconductor (HTS) coils wound from continuously processed dip-coated BSCCO 2212 tape conductor. Using dip-coated tape, the plan was for MRI magnet coils to be wound to fit an established commercial open geometry, 0. 2 Tesla permanent magnet system. New electronics and imaging software for a prototype higher field superconducting system would have added significantly to the cost. However, {{the use of the}} 0. 2 T platform would allow the technical feasibility and the cost issues for HTS systems to be fully established. Also it would establish the energy efficiency and savings of HTS open MRI compared with resistive and permanent magnet systems. The commercial goal was an open geometry HTS MRI running at 0. 5 T and 20 K. This low field open magnet was using resistive normal metal conductor and its heat loss was rather high around 15 kolwatts. It was expected that an HTS magnet would dissipate around 1 watt, significantly reduce power consumption. The SPI team assembled to achieve this goal was led by Oxford Instruments, Superconducting Technology (OST), who developed the method of producing commercial dip coated <b>tape.</b> Superconductive <b>Components</b> Inc. (SCI), a leading US supplier of HTS powders, supported the conductor optimization through powder optimization, scaling, and cost reduction. Oxford Magnet Technology (OMT), a joint venture between Oxford Instruments and Siemens and the world’s leading supplier of MRI magnet systems, was involved to design and build the HTS MRI magnet and cryogenics. Siemens Magnetic Resonance Division, a leading developer and supplier of complete MRI imaging systems, was expected to integrate the final system and perform imaging trials. The original MRI demonstration project was ended in July 2004 by mutual consent of Oxford Instruments and Siemens. Between the project start and that date a substantial shift in the MRI marketplace occurred, with rapid growth for systems at higher fields (1. 5 T and above) and a consequent decline in the low field market (< 1. 0 T). While the project aim appeared technically attainable at that time, the conclusion was reached that the system and market economics do not warrant additional investment. The program was redirected to develop BSCCO 2212 multifilament wire development for high field superconducting magnets for NMR and other scientific research upon an agreement between DOE and Oxford Instruments, Superconducting Technology. The work t took place between September, 2004 and the project end in early 2006 was focused on 2212 multifilamentary wire. This report summarizes the technical achievements both in 2212 dip coated for an HTS MRI system and in BSCCO 2212 multifilamentary wire for high field magnets...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} use of {{heuristic}} algorithms {{in a number of}} combinatorial problems that occur in various resource constrained environments. Such problems occur, for example, in manufacturing, where a restricted number of resources (tools, machines, feeder slots) are needed to perform some operations. Many of these problems turn out to be computationally intractable, and heuristic algorithms are used to provide efficient, yet sub-optimal solutions. The main goal of the present study is to build upon existing methods to create new heuristics that provide improved solutions for some of these problems. All of these problems occur in practice, and one of the motivations of our study was the request for improvements from industrial sources. We approach three different resource constrained problems. The first is the tool switching and loading problem, and occurs especially in the assembly of printed circuit boards. This problem has to be solved when an efficient, yet small primary storage is used to access resources (tools) from a less efficient (but unlimited) secondary storage area. We study various forms of the problem and provide improved heuristics for its solution. Second, the nozzle assignment problem is concerned with selecting a suitable set of vacuum nozzles for the arms of a robotic assembly machine. It turns out that this is a specialized formulation of the MINMAX resource allocation formulation of the apportionment problem and it can be solved efficiently and optimally. We construct an exact algorithm specialized for the nozzle selection and provide a proof of its optimality. Third, the problem of feeder assignment and <b>component</b> <b>tape</b> construction occurs when electronic components are inserted and certain <b>component</b> types cause <b>tape</b> movement delays that can significantly impact the efficiency of printed circuit board assembly. Here, careful selection of component slots in the feeder improves the tape movement speed.

40|$|Low {{temperature}} co-fired ceramic (LTCC) {{technology has}} attracted remarkable attention in fabrication of sensors and micro-fluidic devices {{in the last}} decade. Although structuring planar LTCC foils, which are processed and screen-printed with thick-films, seems straight forward, major problems are encountered once basic sensor features such as cavities and micro-channels are desired within the sensor module. Therefore, this study aims to accomplish two major tasks: development of an advanced technique for fabrication of well-defined and integrated cavities in LTCC and production of novel sensors by using new design parameters and compatible materials systems. Concerning the former objective, we developed graphite-based sacrificial (GB) pastes, which was screen-printed on LTCC, stacked with additional layers and fired. Cavities were formed by removal of sacrificial pastes during different stages of firing: GB was oxidized during sintering of the LTCC module. We selected membrane with inlet and outlet channels as our model device to study the oxidation kinetics of the GB paste {{as a function of}} graphite particle size, paste formulation, heating rate, channel dimensions and LTCC open-pore closure behavior and its effects on the membrane features. We found that higher heating rates (> 2. 5 °C/min) shifted the oxidation of the paste to higher temperature as expected, whereas lower rates resulted in burnout and LTCC densification at lower temperatures, changing the cavity from a swollen to sagged structure, respectively. Channel dimensions were also found to have a direct influence on membrane swelling such that wider (400 µm) and thicker (> 70 µm of printed paste) channels permitted increased oxygen intake and played the major role in oxidation of the paste, after the closure of LTCC open porosity. We produced membranes within a diameter range of 7 - 18 mm and well-defined spacing of 13 to 100 µm. Displacement of largest membranes, which can be used as sensitive pressure sensors at sub- 20 mbar range, were characterized in terms of applied pressure and membrane swelling. A hysteretic behavior of membrane displacement was observed as a function of swelling, which was absent in case of relatively flat membranes. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, fabrication of novel, LTCC-based sensors as an alternative to alumina-based ones was covered. Promising device applications were realized using distinctive properties of LTCC such as low thermal conductivity (an order of magnitude lower than alumina), design flexibility, fine substrate thicknesses (40 µm), lower elastic modulus, etc. Thus, we demonstrated three LTCC-based sensors detecting gas viscosity, force and inclination. Physical principle, materials selection, fabrication procedure and performance of these sensors were explained in detail. The materials compatibility, which is one of the utmost important parameters to assure the quality and the performance of the sensors, was discussed by using various materials characterization techniques and instruments. Differential shrinkage between LTCC <b>tape</b> and thick-film <b>components</b> and the process-dependent-tape shrinkage were found to be the major challenges, which also present the main boundaries of this technology today. In order to avoid the former problem, we modified thick-film terminations by mixing with network-forming additives such as quartz so that its shrinkage behavior was matched to LTCC. This facilitated utilization of thinner LTCC substrates, which is one of the figure of merits, for improved force sensing. The shrinkage of the sensor module, on the other hand, was compensated by manipulating design parameters in light of observed dimensional changes. Finally, future perspectives for structuring LTCC are presented, where an alternative technique to GB pastes is presented: mineral-based sacrificial pastes. In spite of similarity to GB pastes in processing conditions and parameters, these new pastes are formulated by a mixture of high and low melting temperature mineral (CaO) and glass (B 2 O 3), respectively, where a consolidated state is formed that is etched by acid after firing. It was observed that the technique results in well-defined spacing and efficient removal characteristics. On the other hand, shrinkage mismatch to that of LTCC remains a problem...|$|R
