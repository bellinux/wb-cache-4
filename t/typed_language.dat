Types are inductively defined; given two types δ and σ there is also a type σ → δ that {{represents}} functions from objects of type σ to objects of type δ. A structure for a <b>typed</b> <b>language</b> (in the ordinary first-order semantics) must include a separate set of objects of each type, and for a function type the structure must have complete information about the function represented by each object of that type.|$|E

2500|$|HyperTalk is a weakly <b>typed</b> <b>language.</b> All variables, {{and in fact}} all {{values of}} any kind, are stored as typeless {{character}} strings handled by the interpreter as numbers or text based purely on context. This has a cost in speed. Variables need not be declared, but rather are created on the fly as they are required. For example, the following expression creates a variable named total, and sets its initial value: put 15 into total. Then the expression add 3 to total {{would result in the}} string [...] "18" [...] being stored in that variable. Taking this further, a powerful and intuitive structure known as [...] "chunking" [...] allows precise manipulation of text and number strings. It is possible, for example, to have the second character of the value [...] "123" [...] (the 2) added to the last character of the value [...] "12345", yielding [...] "12347". For another example, word 3 of [...] "life is cruel" [...] (cruel) can be appended after the first word of [...] "Hello world", yielding [...] "Hello cruel world". It would then be possible to put [...] "Goodbye" [...] into [...] the first word of that string, replacing the current value of that word to yield [...] "Goodbye cruel world". The above mentioned terms: character, word, first, last, after, and into, among many others, offer English-like control over the ability to crunch numbers and parse text, down to the character level.|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} programming, programming {{languages are}} often colloquially classified as strongly typed or weakly typed (loosely typed). These terms {{do not have}} a precise definition, but in general, a strongly <b>typed</b> <b>language</b> is more likely to generate an error or refuse to compile if the argument passed to a function does not closely match the expected type. On the other hand, a weakly <b>typed</b> <b>language</b> may produce unpredictable results or may perform implicit type conversion. A different but related concept is latent typing.|$|E

40|$|Message passing is {{a crucial}} feature of any {{object-oriented}} language implementation. Even more so in dynamically <b>typed</b> <b>languages,</b> where the absence of compile-time type information forces the implementation to perform run-time type checking at each message send. Traditional techniques {{for the implementation of}} message passing in those languages favor flexibility and space efficiency over speed. This paper explores an alternative called compact dispatch tables suited to environments with high requirements in time and space efficiency. Compact dispatch tables are one solution to achieve fast, and constant-time, message passing in dynamically <b>typed</b> <b>languages</b> and to bring them one step closer to the efficiency of statically <b>typed</b> <b>languages...</b>|$|R

25|$|Static typing usually {{results in}} {{compiled}} code that executes faster. When the compiler knows the exact data types {{that are in}} use, it can produce optimized machine code. Further, compilers for statically <b>typed</b> <b>languages</b> can find assembler shortcuts more easily. Some dynamically <b>typed</b> <b>languages</b> such as Common Lisp allow optional type declarations for optimization for this reason. Static typing makes this pervasive.|$|R

5000|$|Programming {{languages}} are often colloquially classified as strongly typed or weakly typed (also loosely typed) {{to refer to}} certain aspects of type safety. In 1974, Liskov and Zilles defined a strongly-typed language as one in which [...] "whenever an object is passed from a calling function to a called function, its type must be compatible with the type declared in the called function."In 1977, Jackson wrote, [...] "In a strongly <b>typed</b> <b>language</b> each data area will have a distinct type and each process will state its communication requirements in terms of these types."In contrast, a weakly <b>typed</b> <b>language</b> may produce unpredictable results or may perform implicit type conversion.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIncreasing trends towards adaptive, distributed, {{generative}} {{and pervasive}} software have made object-oriented dynamically <b>typed</b> <b>languages</b> become increasingly popular. These languages offer dynamic software evolution {{by means of}} reflection, facilitating the development of dynamic systems. Unfortunately, this dynamism commonly imposes a runtime performance penalty. In this paper, we describe how to extend a production JIT-compiler virtual machine to support runtime object-oriented structural reflection offered by many dynamic languages. Our approach improves runtime performance of dynamic languages running on statically typed virtual machines. At the same time, existing statically <b>typed</b> <b>languages</b> are still supported by the virtual machine. We have extended the. Net platform with runtime structural reflection adding prototype-based object-oriented semantics to the statically typed class-based model of. Net, supporting both kinds of programming languages. The assessment of runtime performance and memory consumption has revealed that a direct support of structural reflection in a production JIT-based virtual machine designed for statically <b>typed</b> <b>languages</b> provides a significant performance improvement for dynamically <b>typed</b> <b>languages...</b>|$|R
40|$|This work motivates a new {{approach}} to type checking functional programs building a bridge between static typing and soft <b>typing.</b> A <b>type</b> <b>language</b> for this approach can be very precise; e. g. it may contain large and detailed subtyping hierarchies.
