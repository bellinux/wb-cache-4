His detractors were eager to denounce <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> high-pressure steam, but Trevithick proved that the accident happened because his fireman had neglected to keep the boiler full of water. He publicised his invention widely, without patent, to counter these criticisms.|$|E
50|$|The {{hypothesis}} that standard medical <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> the disease were heavily biased towards hospital based patients attracted {{the interest of}} Dr. Peter Williams, then secretary of the Wellcome Trust, and a chance meeting resulted in Wellcome Trust support to Dr. Paul Milner, Dr. Graham Serjeant and Beryl {{over the next four}} years (1967-71). The grant provided a Volkswagen minibus which functioned as a mobile clinic and extensive travels over Jamaica following up patients long lost to the Clinic and the University Hospital showed that many were well and had actually improved with age. This observation changed <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> sickle-cell disease, confirmed the role of symptomatic selection and made the case for studies of the true natural history based on newborn detection of the disease.|$|R

So inspired by that, the album came out that way...I still love that album very much...it came together in a very natural way. The songs were sometimes written in a day, it did take time to work it out more, the way it sounded in the end, but it was like the ideas and <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> certain songs were written mostly in one day, the chorus and the verses." ...|$|R

500|$|Lord Hope {{said that}} there was [...] "a {{formidable}} body of authority which should not be lightly disregarded" [...] in favour of the immunity. He emphasised that the rule was not there to protect the incompetent expert witness, but ensure that witnesses were not deterred from coming forward and giving evidence without facing allegations afterwards in attempt to obtain damages from them. He was concerned by the lack of evidence either way as to whether an exception to the rule in Watson was needed or the consequences of introducing such an exception, particularly as the effect of the decision of the majority was to remove the immunity with retrospective effect, and there was [...] "no way back" [...] from this without legislation. The [...] "need for certainty" [...] made it necessary to extend the rule to all witnesses, in his view, even though some genuine claims may be barred as a result. He was particularly concerned that an [...] "incautious" [...] removal of the immunity from experts [...] "risks destabilising the protection that is given to witnesses generally", adding that the approach of Lord Phillips contained [...] "seeds...for challenging <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> witness immunity." ...|$|E

She eventually signed with Geffen in 2003. As for her role as co-writer of the songs, Simpson has said that she had a lot of input lyrically: [...] "...I come up with <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> the song. To me, writing is a very important thing. It's what I've always done and what I've always loved to do, and it was a big part of my wanting to do a record. So my label was amazing because they really let me have my hands in there. I got to write a lot." [...] Simpson said of making the album: [...] "It's a lot of work. From finding the right label to the actual recording, it took about nine months, then it was followed by the publicity work." [...] In an extensive list of thank-yous in the album's liner notes, Simpson includes Benji and Joel Madden of the band Good Charlotte, with whom she worked on the song [...] "Harder Everyday," [...] which was released as an international bonus track.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{investigating}} {{the meaning of}} “to tie” in Muna language based on natural semantics metalanguage. The data were collected through interview and noting techniques. It was analyzed by using natural semantics metalanguage (NSM), an approach to investigate the meaning in <b>the</b> <b>whole.</b> <b>The</b> <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> NSM like semantic prime, non -compositional polysemy, and universal syntax of meaning used to explain the meaning of “to tie”. The result of this study shows that meaning of “to tie” of Muna can be expressed {{by a number of}} lexicons and each form has certain or distinctive meaning, namely tapu, koli, langke, kantaie, ge:ge:, konde, tangkula, kinie, bhoke, kobho, dopo, songko, fekarindie, fealatie, bhontu, ghontoghe, pulo, gantue. Through NSM approach, it can be reveal that tangkula, konde, and kinie seem to have similar object (hair) with distinctive feature. While, the others have specific object and different purposes for each lexicon like ge:ge: for stomache only, langke for mad men, tapu for one thing, koli for two things, kobho for more than two things, fekarindhie and fealatie for someone who does mistakes, and other lexicon variations...|$|R

Wherever he went, Fisher's office was backstopping him, getting all the necessary background information so he'd be prepared for any kind of question that came up. Of course, Acheson's own approach to being Secretary of State was such that when you took an agreement to him to be signed, his chief question was [...] "By what authority do I sign this?"

The sources studied include the major philosophical, but also deal more widely with literature and religion. Gnosticism, Christianity and the works of Philo are treated towards the end of each chapter, because each of these strands is crucial on the formation of Patristic and Medieval philosophy...|$|R

2500|$|Following {{the reply}} by of the Swabian League, {{delivered}} on 27 February 1525, Ulrich Schmid justified the peasants' demands {{by referring to}} the [...] "Divine Law", the concept of which, {{as opposed to the}} Traditional (Old) Law, meaning the traditional legal norms, offered a completely new perspective in the legal relationship between lord and peasant. The political order had to be compared with the divine will as manifested in the Bible. By doing so, the peasant challenged <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> traditional law. Ulrich Schmid, the representative of the Baltringer Haufen, rejected the traditional legal process through the Imperial Chamber Court to solve the complaints of the peasants. Theologians had to decide as to whether the peasants' demands were justified. Ulrich Schmid proposed that a group of men, learnèd and steeped in Christian lore, should decide what constitutes this [...] "Divine Law". The representatives of the Swabian League concurred and announced that they would also pray to God {{in order to ensure that}} these learnèd men would be chosen. Ulrich Schmid hoped that regarding this issue he would be helped in Memmingen where he managed to recruit Sebastian Lotzer, a journeyman furrier, to take on the role of clerk to the Baltringer Haufen. On 28 February 1525, the Baltringer Haufen officially declared its formation to the Imperial city of Ehingen in a missive composed by Lotzer. The wording of this missive seems to imply that there may already have been contacts between Lotzer, who resided in Memmingen and had been active as clerk to the Memminger peasants, and Schmid well before the end of February 1525.|$|E
