Voluntary <b>turnover</b> <b>of</b> talented <b>staff</b> can be costly, especially in small firms where there are few slack resources. However, there is scant research on retention in small firms. We use the concept of Job Embeddedness to understand why small firm employees stay. The concept refers to the totality of forces that embed employees in their jobs and it consists of three dimensions: fit, links, and sacrifice. Seven propositions are outlined comparing the ways fit, links and sacrifice might play out for small and large firm employees.

METHOD This is a descriptive-exploratory study, classified as case study, conducted in a teaching hospital in the southeastern, Brazil, in the period from May to November 2013. The population was composed by the nursing staff, using Nursing Turnover Cost Calculation Methodology. RESULTS The total cost <b>of</b> <b>turnover</b> was R$ 314. 605, 62, and ranged from R$ 2. 221, 42 to R$ 3. 073, 23 per employee. The costs of pre-hire totaled R$ 101. 004, 60 (32, 1 %), and the hiring process consumed R$ 92. 743, 60 (91. 8 %) The costs of post-hire totaled R$ 213. 601, 02 (67, 9 %), for the sub process decreased productivity, R$ 199. 982, 40 (93. 6 %).

30|$|Despite anonymisation of {{patients}} and surgeons {{for the purposes of}} the study, only just over one half of all laparoscopic surgeries performed during the study period were examined. Reasons for this include a high <b>turnover</b> <b>of</b> theatre <b>staff</b> in the holding bay of theatre, as well as difficulty ensuring that surgeons completed the datasheets following emergency surgeries at night. As completion of the datasheet was voluntary, we did not anticipate data from all laparoscopic entries. However, because we had decided to anonymise the datasheet so that neither the patient nor the surgeon could be identified, we would have been glad of a greater recruitment of cases. There is a chance that more difficult laparoscopic entry cases or even entry complications were not recorded.|$|R

50|$|Emphatically, Sowell {{repeatedly}} {{rejects the}} popular tendency to put {{economic and political}} decisions and their results in moral terms. Doing so, he argues, ignores the tradeoffs and limitations inherent in every economic system and society. Consistent with his established laissez-faire viewpoints, Sowell also indicts price controls (such as rent control, minimum wage, price fixing, and subsidies) as interfering in the implicit communication between consumers and producers necessary to optimize the choices of each. The fact that some industries or government agencies seem particularly incompetent or corrupt over many <b>turnovers</b> <b>of</b> their <b>staff,</b> he argues, is not bad people performing the duties but of rational people acting in their own interests responding to whatever incentives have been established in the system.|$|R
