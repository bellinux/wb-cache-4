50|$|Supralethal {{doses of}} {{aminopterin}} may be rescued with the antidote Leucovorin (also known as folinic acid), a reduced form of folic acid which bypasses dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme inhibited by aminopterin. Leucovorin {{has been used}} in rats, dogs and humans to rescue aminopterin toxicity. Leucovorin rescue is a therapeutic maneuver intentionally employed with antifolates to achieve <b>tumoricidal</b> <b>drug</b> concentrations that would otherwise be lethal to the patient.|$|E
40|$|The tumor microvasculature is hyperpermeable to plasma proteins, but the {{specific}} vessels that leak {{have not been}} identified. To investigate this question, the extravasation of circulating tracers of varying size was studied by fluorescence, light, and electron microscopy in animals bearing solid transplantable carcinomas. In all five tumors studied, 70 and 150 kD fluoresceinated (FITC) -dextrans and colloidal carbon leaked extensively from the prominent vascular plexus that was induced around individual tumor nodules and at the tumor-host interface. Leaky vessels were mature veins or venules, lined by a continuous endothelium; most had closed interendothelial cell junctions. Immature interface vessels and tumor-penetrating vessels did not leak these macromolecular tracers significantly. Three kD of FITC-dextran leaked from peripherally situated tumor veins or venules but also extravasated from tumor-penetrating vessels and capillaries supplying normal tissues. These data correlate the functional and anatomic heterogeneity of tumor vessels and provide a rationale for the distribution of circulating molecules such as monoclonal antibodies and <b>tumoricidal</b> <b>drugs</b> in solid tumors...|$|R
40|$|With {{the current}} {{national}} commitment to cancer research, new and challenging areas of investigation are being planned. Hopefully, this inevitably expanding search {{into the nature}} and treatment of malignant tumors will include a continued examination of current chemotherapeutic agents. These standard <b>tumoricidal</b> <b>drugs</b> {{have proved to be}} effective in the therapy of numerous cancers despite an incomplete understanding of their mode of action in many cases (1 - 4). A further unraveling of the pharmacologic basis of these drugs should undoubtedly lead to a greater therapeutic effect, perhaps producing longer remissions and increased cures. A recent example of how continued basic research on available antineoplastic agents may reveal findings pertinent to clinical chemotherapy concerns methotrexate, a drug frequently employed in the treatment of cancer (1 - 5, 66). Traditionally, the mode of action of this drug has assumed to be as an analog of the vitamin folic acid. In humans, folic acid is biologically inactive, requiring reduction by an enzyme termed "dihydrofolate reductase " to dehydrofolate, and then to tetrahydrofolate. This latter compound accepts 1 -carbon fragments from various sources to produce the folate coenzymes. These compounds act as 1 -carbon donors in numerous biochemical reactions, including the synthesis of the B-carbon of serines, the formation of the C- 2 and C- 8 units of the purine skeleton, and th...|$|R
