5|$|North Michigan Avenue is a six-lane <b>two-way</b> <b>street</b> that is {{serviced}} by Chicago Transit Authority public buses along the Magnificent Mile that connect {{the area to}} the entire Chicago metropolitan area. It is also {{serviced by}} seasonal trolley service along the street, and {{the foot of the}} Magnificent Mile is serviced by seasonal water transit services. Two blocks west along State Street, the Chicago 'L' rapid transit services the street via its Red Line. Pedestrian traffic abounds along the broad sidewalks that are shielded by extensive, mature greenery that provides much of the friendly atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|But {{transmission}} of Ca2+ is not unidirectional; rather, it is a <b>two-way</b> <b>street.</b> The {{properties of the}} Ca2+ pump SERCA and the channel IP3R present on the ER membrane facilitate feedback regulation coordinated by MAM function. In particular, the clearance of Ca2+ by the MAM allows for spatio-temporal patterning of Ca2+ signaling because Ca2+ alters IP3R activity in a biphasic manner. SERCA is likewise affected by mitochondrial feedback: uptake of Ca2+ by the MAM stimulates ATP production, thus providing energy that enables SERCA to reload the ER with Ca2+ for continued Ca2+ efflux at the MAM. Thus, the MAM is not a passive buffer for Ca2+ puffs; rather it helps modulate further Ca2+ signaling through feedback loops that affect ER dynamics.|$|E
5|$|In {{downtown}} Adrian, {{the highways}} previously split into an uncommon arrangement of one-way streets. This arrangement {{was similar to}} a traffic circle in how the traffic was routed through the central business district on Church, Broad, Front and Winter streets. The first one-way pairing started on Main Street at the intersection with Winter Street. Northbound traffic continued on Main Street, while southbound traffic was routed along Winter Street. At Church Street, westbound Bus. US223/northbound M-52 turned east for a block on Church and then north onto Broad Street. Then the highway designations continued on Broad Street three blocks north to Front Street, passing {{to the east of}} the downtown businesses. The designations were then routed west along Front Street. At Main Street, M-52 turned back north again as a <b>two-way</b> <b>street.</b> In the opposite direction, southbound M-52 traffic was diverted from Main west on Front Street. Front Street west of Main Street carried southbound M-52 and westbound Bus. US223 traffic one block west to Winter Street, which then turned down Winter. Westbound Bus. US223 traffic turned west along Maumee Street while eastbound Bus. US223 followed southbound M-52 down Winter to Main Street. This arrangement was ended in November 2009 when the City of Adrian converted all of the one-way streets to two-way traffic. Downtown streets had been converted to one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973.|$|E

25|$|US62 Business {{begins at}} the {{intersection}} of Main Street (NY104) and Pine Avenue in downtown Niagara Falls. Unlike the two streets—Walnut and Ferry Avenues—that carry US62 through Niagara Falls to the south, Pine Avenue is a <b>two-way</b> <b>street,</b> the first such east–west street accessible from NY104 heading north from the Rainbow Bridge. Heading east from NY104, US62 Business passes through a largely commercial neighborhood. At a signalized intersection with 7th Street two blocks from NY104, the surroundings become residential in nature; however, the road reenters strictly commercial areas at 10th Street. Between 10th and Portage Road, a local northsouth arterial, US62 Business passes along the northern edge of the Niagara Falls Memorial Medical Center.|$|E
5000|$|Despite this, the {{operator}} of {{a motor vehicle}} may (incompletely) regard a street as merely a thoroughfare for vehicular travel or parking. As far as concerns the driver, a street can be one-way or two-way: vehicles on one-way streets may travel in only one direction, while those on <b>two-way</b> <b>streets</b> may travel both ways. One way streets typically have signs reading [...] "ONE WAY" [...] and an arrow showing the direction of allowed travel. Most <b>two-way</b> <b>streets</b> are wide enough {{for at least two}} lanes of traffic.|$|R

25|$|Broadway {{once was}} a <b>two-way</b> <b>street</b> for its entire length. The present status, in which it runs one-way {{southbound}} south of Columbus Circle (59th Street), came about in several stages. On June 6, 1954, Seventh Avenue became southbound and Eighth Avenue became northbound south of Broadway. None of Broadway became one-way, but the increased southbound traffic between Columbus Circle (Eighth Avenue) and Times Square (Seventh Avenue) caused the city to re-stripe that section of Broadway for four southbound and two northbound lanes. Broadway became one-way from Columbus Circle south to Herald Square (34th Street) on March 10, 1957, in conjunction with Sixth Avenue becoming one-way from Herald Square north to 59th Street and Seventh Avenue becoming one-way from 59th Street south to Times Square (where it crosses Broadway). On June 3, 1962, Broadway became one-way south of Canal Street, with Trinity Place and Church Street carrying northbound traffic. Another change was made on November 10, 1963, when Broadway became one-way southbound from Herald Square to Madison Square (23rd Street) and Union Square (14th Street) to Canal Street, and two routes – Sixth Avenue south of Herald Square and Centre Street, Lafayette Street, and Fourth Avenue south of Union Square – became one-way northbound. Finally, {{at the same time}} as Madison Avenue became one-way northbound and Fifth Avenue became one-way southbound, Broadway was made one-way southbound between Madison Square (where Fifth Avenue crosses) and Union Square on January 14, 1966, completing its conversion south of Columbus Circle.|$|E

40|$|Child {{pedestrian}} {{injuries are}} a very important cause of childhood mortality globally. 1, 2 Motor vehicle injuries lead the list of injury deaths at all ages during child-hood and adolescence; 3 and among the five- to nine-year-old age group, pedestrian injuries overshadow occupant injuries {{as a cause of}} death and are in fact {{the leading cause of death}} from unintentional injuries in this age group. 2, 4 The city of Hamilton has a significant percentage (7 %) of kilometres of one-way streets. We reviewed the literature and found that environmental risk factors not only contribute highly to child pedestrian injuries but also that countries that have had the largest decrease and have the low-est absolute rates of injuries have emphasized their modification. 5 - 9 We found five 10 - 14 studies that addressed the directionality of the street to the risk of injury, none of which were peer reviewed. Zeeger et al. 12 found the presence of one-way streets to be the geometric feature most related to low pedestrian injuries at signalized intersec-tions in 15 U. S. cities (although less than traffic and pedestrian volume). However only injuries occurring at signalized inter-sections were included and since one-way and two-way intersections were not sam-pled representatively (only signal timing schemes were), the importance of one-way directionality might be confounded by oversampling of that intersection type. Two studies 10, 11 found a decrease in injury count after conversion to a one-way street: Ewens 10 also looked at injuries on <b>two-way</b> <b>streets</b> and did not see a similar decrease, while Bruce 11 did not have a control of injuries on non-converted <b>two-way</b> <b>streets.</b> Both failed to include exposure variables (e. g., kilometres of streets) to assess rates of injury. This study aims to contribute to the developing literature on the role of direc-tionality. The objectives were to identify if there is a difference in child pedestrian injury rates on one-way and <b>two-way</b> <b>streets,</b> and to examine whether the charac-teristics of child pedestrian injuries differ between one-way and <b>two-way</b> <b>streets.</b> METHOD...|$|R

[...] Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them.
