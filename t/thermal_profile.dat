25|$|The Process Window Index is {{calculated}} {{as the worst}} case (i.e. highest number) in the set of <b>thermal</b> <b>profile</b> data. For each profile statistic the percentage used of the respective process window {{is calculated}}, and the worst case (i.e. highest percentage) is the PWI.|$|E
25|$|Process Window Index (PWI) is a {{statistical}} measure that quantifies the robustness of a manufacturing process, e.g. one which involves heating and cooling, {{known as a}} thermal process. In manufacturing industry, PWI values are used to calibrate the heating and cooling of soldering jobs (known as a <b>thermal</b> <b>profile)</b> while baked in a reflow oven.|$|E
25|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>profile</b> can be ranked {{on how it}} fits in {{a process}} window (the {{specification}} or tolerance limit). Raw temperature values are normalized {{in terms of a}} percentage relative to both the process mean and the window limits. The center of the process window is defined as zero, and the extreme edges of the process window are ±99%. A Process Window Index (PWI) {{greater than or equal to}} 100% indicates the profile is outside of the process limitations. A PWI of 99% indicates that the profile is within process limitations, but runs at the edge of the process window. For example, if the process mean is set at 200°C with the process window calibrated at 180°C and 220°C respectively, then a measured value of 188°C translates to a process window index of 60%.|$|E
30|$|Constant and temperature-dependent <b>thermal</b> <b>profiles</b> {{indicate}} that <b>thermal</b> conductivity {{has an important}} impact on subsurface temperature distributions. <b>Thermal</b> <b>profiles</b> using constant <b>thermal</b> conductivity respond very closely to basin geometry, while temperature-dependent <b>thermal</b> <b>profiles</b> display a gradual change in geothermal gradient with depth.|$|R
40|$|We used intracoelomically {{implanted}} temperature dataloggers {{to obtain}} semi-continuous body temperature data and establish monthly <b>thermal</b> <b>profiles</b> for free-ranging rattlesnakes. We mimicked random and non-random point-sampling methods by selecting a single daily data point from all values or from restricted {{times of day}} to reflect common point-sampling constraints. <b>Thermal</b> <b>profiles</b> generated from point-sampling differed from those generated from semi-continuous sampling, and this difference was more apparent when point-sampling was non-random. We conclude that semi-continuous sampling provides a better estimate of <b>thermal</b> <b>profiles,</b> and that point-sampling methods are highly sensitive to deviations from true randomness...|$|R

2500|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>profile</b> is {{a complex}} set of time-temperature data {{typically}} associated with the measurement of thermal temperatures in an oven (ex: reflow oven).

2500|$|For example, a <b>thermal</b> <b>profile</b> {{with three}} thermocouples, with four profile {{statistics}} logged for each thermocouple, {{would have a}} set of twelve statistics for that <b>thermal</b> <b>profile.</b> In this case, the PWI would be the highest value among the twelve percentages of the respective process windows.|$|E

5000|$|For {{people looking}} to find <b>thermal</b> <b>profiles</b> for cryogenics, {{a number of}} {{companies}} maintain <b>thermal</b> <b>profiles</b> of various products that are updated for accuracy at least a few times a year with their ongoing research, including data from independent trials and studies. However, obtaining these profiles is sometimes difficult if they are not used for educational purposes (mainly institutional research), as they typically only provide the updated profiles to their longtime [...] "service center" [...] partners around the world.|$|R
2500|$|An {{example of}} a process to which the PWI concept may be applied is soldering. [...] In soldering, a <b>thermal</b> <b>profile</b> is the set of time-temperature values {{for a variety of}} {{processes}} such as slope, thermal soak, reflow, and peak.|$|E
2500|$|Each <b>thermal</b> <b>profile</b> {{is ranked}} {{on how it}} fits in a process window (the {{specification}} or tolerance limit). Raw temperature values are normalized {{in terms of a}} percentage relative to both the process mean and the window limits. The center of the process window is defined as zero, and the extreme edges of the process window are ±99%. A PWI {{greater than or equal to}} 100% indicates that the profile does not process the product within specification. A PWI of 99% indicates that the profile [...] runs at the edge of the process window. For example, if the process mean is set at 200°C, with the process window calibrated at 180°C and 220°C respectively; then a measured value of 188°C translates to a process window index of 60%. [...] A lower PWI value indicates a more robust profile. For maximum efficiency, separate PWI values are computed for peak, slope, reflow, and soak processes of a <b>thermal</b> <b>profile.</b>|$|E
2500|$|To avoid [...] {{thermal shock}} {{affecting}} production, the steepest slope in the <b>thermal</b> <b>profile</b> is determined and leveled. Manufacturers use custom-built software to accurately determine and decrease the steepness of the slope. In addition, the software also automatically recalibrates the PWI {{values for the}} peak, slope, reflow, and soak processes. By setting PWI values, engineers can ensure that the reflow soldering work does not overheat or cool too quickly.|$|E
30|$|It can be {{concluded}} that temperature-dependent and non-temperature-dependent <b>thermal</b> <b>profiles</b> distinctively vary from each other. Geothermal gradients between {{the two sets of}} models (temperature dependent and non-temperature dependent) at times exhibit rather large temperature discrepancies; for example, profile 4 point 9 (80  km along the profile) has up to 50  °C difference in temperature, and in geothermal exploration this is a substantial temperature gap. In sum, temperature field variation between temperature-dependent and non-temperature-dependent <b>thermal</b> <b>profiles</b> are sufficiently significant to infer that temperature-dependent thermal conductivity has an important impact in the way heat is distributed in the Sydney Basin (Lemenager and O’Neill 2016).|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{modeling}} and simulations {{were used to}} analyze the <b>thermal</b> <b>profiles</b> of a polysilicon-metal test structure generated by thermally-induced voltage alteration (TIVA), a new laser-based failure analysis technique to localize shorted interconnects. The results show that variations in TIVA <b>thermal</b> <b>profiles</b> are due mainly to preferential laser absorption in various locations in the test structure. Differences in oxide thickness also affect the local heat conduction and temperature distribution. Modeling results also show that local variation in heat conduction is less important than the absorbed laser power in determining the local temperatures since our test structure has feature sizes that are small compared to the length over which heat spreads...|$|R
40|$|General {{circulation}} models (GCMs) {{are currently}} {{able to provide}} physically consistent simulations of millennial climate variability in which estimations of external forcing factors are incorporated as boundary conditions. Climate reconstruction attempts to recover as faithfully as possible past climate variability {{using a variety of}} independent and climate-sensitive sources of information. By deriving strategies of comparison between GCM simulations and proxy data, or directly recorded data such as subsurface <b>thermal</b> <b>profiles,</b> the agreement between model and observations can be assessed. <b>Thermal</b> <b>profiles</b> obtained from the boreholes of North America were grouped into eight geographically discrete ensembles and averaged to form robust, representative profiles. The gridded output from the three distinct integrations of the GCM ECHO-g were similarly averaged by region. These simulated, millennial, paleoclimatic histories were then forward modeled to arrive at the subsurface <b>thermal</b> <b>profiles</b> that would result from the temperature trends at the surface. These forward modeled profiles were then compared with the borehole average <b>thermal</b> anomaly <b>profile</b> in each region. In most of the regions studied, the externally forced runs from ECHO-g are in better agreement with underground temperature anomalies than with the control run, suggesting that boreholes are sensitive to external forcing. Not only do ECHO-g simulations demonstrate better agreement with borehole data when considering variable external forcing factors, but ECHO-g also appears to broadly describe qualitative aspects of long-term climatic trends at a regional scale...|$|R
