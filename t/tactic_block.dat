50|$|The {{protest against}} the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Seattle in 1999 was a signal event in the {{anti-globalisation}} movement. Thousands of people gathered to disrupt the World Trade Organisation conference by preventing delegates from entering the conference venue. Simultaneously, an online direct protest was run by The Electrohippies Collective with {{what is now a}} familiar aspect of cyber space: a denial-of-service (DOS) action. This <b>tactic</b> <b>blocked</b> the computer network servicing the WTO meeting by flooding it with requests. The Ehippies claimed success for the action, saying 450,000 people participated over 5 days, resulting in the WTO conference network being constantly slowed and periodically brought to a halt.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the size}} of the fines against him, Bilzerian first filed for {{bankruptcy}} in 1991. Bilzerian emerged from that bankruptcy having paid roughly $400,000 in settlement of debts exceeding $300 million. In 1999 he tried to put his house up for sale, and at one point even Mike Tyson was reportedly interested in buying. He filed for bankruptcy again in January 2001, declaring his assets of $15,805 against $140 million in debts. Under Florida Bankruptcy Law, the value of his primary residence was protected from creditors. The SEC alleged that Bilzerian was using bankruptcy as a <b>tactic</b> to <b>block</b> creditors from finding out the true value of his assets. Later in the month, a federal judge ordered Bilzerian imprisoned for contempt of court due to his failure to disclose his assets.|$|R
50|$|Newhall Ranch is a {{proposed}} large scale master-planned community in an unincorporated portion of Los Angeles County along the Santa Clara River in the westerly {{portion of the}} Santa Clarita Valley.

During the decades the project has been in planning, it has faced legal actions, environmental concerns, and several changes in investors. The landmark California Environmental Quality Act, or CEQA, {{has been used to}} challenge the development even after it received planning approvals. While these lawsuits have been dismissed as merely <b>tactics</b> to <b>block</b> or delay the project by some, others claim the environmental law has led to a better-designed project while saving crucial habitat.|$|R

50|$|Czech insurgents {{were the}} ethnic Czech {{residents}} of Prague, {{forced to work}} for the Nazis. Although spared most of the horrors of war like the draft and massive air raids, they despised anything German and were the first to rise spontaneously without waiting for political orders. Lacking military training, they armed themselves with small arms captured from the Germans. They fought surprisingly well trying to hinder the superior German forces by an extensive network of hastily established street barricades. Their <b>tactics</b> of <b>blocking</b> the German movement proved successful and their main goal of demonstrating Czech resistance was reached. The Czech radio under the leadership of Otakar Matousek had an important role to co-ordinate these actions. However, it was a close call, in which every single hour counted. Thanks to them, Prague liberated itself before the arrival of the Soviets. The Czech National Council—led by Otakar Machotka and loyal to President Edvard Beneš in London—represented them in negotiations. The participating communists stayed loyal to their provisional government in Košice, Slovakia.|$|R
