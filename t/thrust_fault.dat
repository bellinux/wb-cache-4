5|$|East–west-directed {{compression}} from subduction off {{the west}} coast affected the area in later Mesozoic and early Tertiary time by folding and thrust faulting strata. Evidence for the Sevier Orogeny part of this period {{can be seen in}} the Taylor Creek area in the Kolob section of the park. Chunks of Moenave strata have been compressed to the point of thrusting themselves over the same formation in the Taylor Creek <b>Thrust</b> <b>Fault</b> Zone, located on the east flank of the Kanarra anticline.|$|E
5|$|About 1.22million years ago, the San Joaquin Hills {{along the}} Orange County coast began their uplift along a blind <b>thrust</b> <b>fault</b> (the San Joaquin Hills blind thrust) {{extending}} south from the Los Angeles Basin. As Aliso Creek was an antecedent stream, {{or one that}} had formed prior to the mountains' uplift, it cut a water gap through the rising mountains that today is Aliso Canyon. The same phenomenon occurred to the north with Laguna Canyon and San Diego Creek, and to the south at San Juan Creek. The uplift also caused Aliso Creek's largest tributary, Sulphur Creek, to turn north to join Aliso Creek instead of flowing south to Salt Creek. The Wisconsinian era was responsible for shaping the watershed to its present-day form, with deep side canyons and broad alluvial valleys.|$|E

50|$|The PTZ {{represents}} the transitional zone between the extensional and compressional environments along the Manila Trench. This region increases in compressional strength as it approaches the accretionary prism of the trench. The PTZ also displays blind <b>thrust</b> <b>faults</b> and folds (essentially buried folds and faults). It {{has been suggested}} that these <b>thrust</b> <b>faults</b> originated along preexisting normal <b>faults.</b> These blind <b>thrust</b> <b>faults</b> present potential danger as they are likely candidates for the causes of high magnitude earthquakes, and in effect large scale tsunamis.|$|R

50|$|Faulting in the Middle Magdalena Basin is {{primarily}} reverse and <b>thrust</b> <b>faulting.</b> Reverse faulting is high angle {{in the west}} and low angle in the eastern and central areas of the basin with normal faults also developing along the eastern margin. These <b>thrust</b> <b>faults</b> formed from <b>thrusting</b> from the eastern margin of the Central Ranges in the Eocene and the western margin of the Eastern Ranges in the Miocene. The major <b>thrust</b> <b>faults</b> in the Middle Magdalena Basin include the Infantas Thrust, La Salina Thrust, and Cantagallo Thrust. The basin is structurally bounded by the Palestina Fault, a dextral strike-slip fault system, {{in the west and}} the Bucaramanga-Santa Marta Fault, a sinistral strike-slip system, in the east.|$|R

25|$|Fault bend folds {{are caused}} by {{displacement}} along a non-planar fault. In non-vertical faults, the hanging-wall deforms to accommodate the mismatch across the fault as displacement progresses. Fault bend folds occur in both extensional and thrust faulting. In extension, listric faults form rollover anticlines in their hanging walls. In thrusting, ramp anticlines are formed whenever a <b>thrust</b> <b>fault</b> cuts up section from one detachment level to another. Displacement over this higher-angle ramp generates the folding.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of cross-cutting relationships {{pertains to the}} formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a <b>thrust</b> <b>fault.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Hunter Region covers {{most of the}} Hunter Valley of New South Wales {{which is}} {{considered}} a transitional area between the Paleozoic rock foundation of the New England Fold Belt located {{to the south and}} the Early Permian and Middle Triassic period rock formations of the Sydney Basin to the south. Between these two geological areas is the Hunter-Mooki <b>Thrust</b> <b>fault.</b> At one time this fault was very geologically active and gave rise to the Brokenback range that feature prominently in the Hunter region.

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1983 Coalinga earthquake, a blind thrust {{event in the}} central coast ranges of California, a change in {{perspective}} was brought about regarding these types of (concealed) faults. The October 1987 shock occurred on a previously unrecognized blind <b>thrust</b> <b>fault</b> that {{is now known as}} the Puente Hills thrust system. The fault was delineated by the mainshock and aftershock focal mechanisms, fault plane reflection studies, and high resolution seismic profiles, which also revealed that the fault runs from downtown Los Angeles to near Puente Hills. The system {{is considered one of the}} highest-risk faults in the United States due to its moderate dip and its location under a large metropolitan area.|$|E
25|$|The main {{fault in}} the Eastern Hills is the {{longitudinal}} eastward dipping <b>thrust</b> <b>fault</b> called the Bogotá Fault, striking north-northwest to south-southeast, {{parallel to the}} longitudinal axis of the Eastern Hills. It forms the tectonic limit with the Bogotá savanna and acts as a barrier for aquifers. The compressional tectonics thrusted the Cretaceous units of Guadalupe and Chipaque {{on top of the}} younger Guaduas, Cacho and Bogotá Formations. The transversal faults oriented northeast–southwest to the Bogotá Fault are from north to south the Usaquén, Río Juan Amarillo, San Cristóbal and Soacha Faults. The compressional La Cajita Fault is parallel to the main strike of the Bogotá Fault and the Eastern Hills and outcrops in the Sumapaz Mountains to the south.|$|E

500|$|Level Mountain is {{the largest}} volcano in the NCVP with respect to both volume and area covered. It has a volume of {{approximately}} [...] and an areal extent of at least , comparable in size to the mafic shield volcanoes found on the Big Island of Hawaii. Smaller but related volcanoes include Hoodoo Mountain (...) , Heart Peaks (...) , Maitland Volcano (...) and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex (...) [...] Because of Level Mountain's great extent {{it can be seen}} from outer space. This, coupled with elevation and snow, helps define the geology of the region. Level Mountain lies on the Nahlin Plateau, a subdivision of the larger Stikine Plateau that is dominated by the volcano. The basement of the shield consists largely of felsic igneous rocks comprising northern Stikinia, but sedimentary rocks are also present below the lava plateau escarpment. Two major northwest trending faults straddle Level Mountain, both of which were active during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. The King Salmon Fault forms a geological boundary between island arc rocks of Stikinia and seafloor rocks of the Cache Creek Terrane. Paleozoic to Mesozoic rocks are exposed in the hanging wall of this <b>thrust</b> <b>fault</b> and are intensely cleaved, particularly near the sole of the thrust.

500|$|The earthquake's {{epicenter}} {{and most}} of the aftershocks lie between the surface traces of two structures, the Spotsylvania Fault, a southeast dipping zone of high ductile strain, and the Chopawamsic Fault, a <b>thrust</b> <b>fault.</b> The earthquake's focal mechanism shows reverse slip faulting on a north to northeast striking fault plane. The spatial distribution of aftershocks show that the causative fault dips to the southeast at 50–55°. There was no surface faulting associated with the earthquake.

Going westward the fault split into two branches, a north-dipping reverse fault (north branch) and a right slip fault (south branch), but neither produced surface rupture. A total of five sub-events occurred in the first eleven seconds and an aftershock measuring 5.8 (local magnitude) occurred four minutes and twenty seconds later.|$|E

Activity in the area is associated with tectonic plate boundary interaction and the source of the event was slip on a <b>thrust</b> <b>fault</b> just to the north of Spitak.
