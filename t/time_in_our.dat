25|$|A {{recurring}} {{plot device}} in The Chronicles is {{the interaction between}} the various worlds that make up the Narnian multiverse. A variety of methods are used to initiate these cross-overs which generally serve to introduce characters to the land of Narnia. The Cosmology of Narnia is not as internally consistent as that of Lewis's contemporary Tolkien's Middle-earth, but suffices given the more fairy tale atmosphere of the work. During the course of the series we learn in passing, that the world of Narnia is flat and geocentric and has different stars from those of Earth, and that the passage of time does not correspond directly to the passage of <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> world.|$|E
500|$|The {{book has}} {{received}} more positive support however. Robert C Neville called Time and Eternity “the most sophisticated treatment of eternity and <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> century so far”. In his Thought: A Very Short Introduction, Tim Bayne says the book contains a “classic” discussion of ineffability. American writer Arthur Goldwag {{has said that the}} phrase [...] "that than which there is no other" [...] that he encountered in Time and Eternity was {{one of a number of}} factors that contributed to him giving up praying.|$|E
500|$|One of Diệm's main themes {{was that}} the {{referendum}} would usher {{in a new era}} of unprecedented democracy: [...] "This shall be but the first step made by our people in the free use of our political rights." [...] The day before the poll, Diệm said: [...] "This 23 October, for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> country's history, our men and women will exercise one of many basic civil rights of a democracy, the right to vote." [...] A government proclamation four days before the poll said: [...] "Dear compatriots, proclaim your will forcefully! Go forward firmly in the path of Freedom, Independence and Democracy!" ...|$|E

Confronted with the terrifying novelty of being a multicultural country, Denmark took a step not merely to the right but to the far right." [...] Professor Anders Linde-Laursen wrote that while the controversy [...] "should be understood as an expression of a growing Islamophobic tendency in Danish society," [...] this is just latest manifestation of a long-standing, and particularly deep conflict between traditionalists and agents of modernity in Denmark, and should not be seen as a major departure for Danish society.|$|E
500|$|Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after seeing two news reports about Project Dante, a robotic explorer created by NASA that had been sent into a volcano. Chris Carter said of the episode, [...] "I think that's the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> second season that we were telling what's one of our serial stories rather than our mythological stories. In other words, it was an X-File rather {{than one of the}} cosmology shows that explore the characters". However, Gordon felt that the episode allowed him to explore the possible results of Mulder's search for the truth, echoing this in the mindset of Daniel Trepkos and the interactions between the two characters. Gordon noted that [...] "the natural endpoint of this quest for the truth is madness", comparing Mulder's treatment of Trepkos with the events of the novel Heart of Darkness.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the {{stop-start}} {{sessions for}} The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, where Kiedis would frequently disappear to seek drugs, pre-production for Mother's Milk went smoothly. Many {{of the songs}} were already written, some even recorded ("Taste the Pain" [...] was recorded prior to Chad joining and featured Philip [...] "Fish" [...] Fisher on drums) {{by the time the}} band started pre-production in January 1989. [...] The band recorded basic tracks at Hully Gully studios in Silver Lake; songs like [...] "Knock Me Down" [...] were formed from jam sessions without any input from returning producer Michael Beinhorn. According to Flea, the Hully Gully sessions bore fruit: [...] "We played hard and fast more than [...] any other <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> career, I think. A lot of chops were going down [...] we played constantly, got to know each other, {{and came up with a}} record." [...] Kiedis and Flea recognized that Frusciante's presence had become a significant influence on the band's new material as the Hully Gully sessions were proving to be extremely productive; Flea recalled that [...] " [...] was an immense new element to the sound of our band and a big opening up for us." ...|$|E

500|$|Anglin officially {{endorsed}} Donald Trump {{for president}} in 2015. Anglin encouraged the website's readers to [...] "vote for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> lives for the one man who actually represents our interests". The website also received national and international coverage for its endorsement of Trump's proposal of a temporary moratorium on admitting foreign Muslims into the country; it proclaimed [...] "Heil Donald Trump – The Ultimate Savior". According to the SPLC, white supremacist endorsement of Trump is unprecedented, as the movement is generally skeptical of all politicians. In July 2016, Andrew Anglin and The Daily Stormer were mentioned by Lacy Clay, Democratic Representative from Missouri, as he asked in a congressional hearing whether FBI director James Comey was aware of Trump sharing Twitter posts by white supremacists. [...] Anglin wrote in July 2016 that he believed that Trump was a pragmatic anti-Semite who praised Israel to win votes from evangelical Christians, while dropping subtle hints about purported Jewish domination of rival Hillary Clinton's campaign. The Huffington Post journalist Jessica Schulberg compared how white nationalists like Anglin and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke believed Trump to be representative of their ethnic interests, {{while at the same}} time several Jews believed him to be representative of theirs.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{a reality}} series {{originated}} when Doherty and Iswarienko were interested in documenting {{the weeks leading up}} to their wedding in a filming and production style similar to [...] and Deadliest Catch. Doherty had previously worked on reality television when she hosted Scare Tactics and Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty and participated on the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars. She called the project her agreement with Iswarienko to [...] "chronicle this <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> lives and let future brides and future grooms know that [...] not just you and that goes through the stress". According to Doherty, it was a way to celebrate her third marriage: [...] "Can you bring all of those qualities to reality TV? Can you be that brutally honest, that completely raw, but with the quality of those two shows where you do use different cameras and you do want it to look spectacular?" [...] Doherty planned to develop the idea with her own production company, originally partnering with an unidentified television network. However, the series was picked up by WE tv when Doherty thought that the previous network was making the material too sensational. Miller said that he approved the series after seeing its pitch, and he found Doherty an appealing person to watch on reality television.|$|E
500|$|Throughout 1969 and 1970, Cooper and Senator Frank Church co-sponsored the Cooper–Church Amendments, {{aimed at}} curbing further {{escalation}} of the Vietnam War. Congressional approval {{of one of these}} amendments on December 15, 1969, de-funded the use of U.S. troops in Laos and Thailand. Cooper had wanted to include a restriction on forces entering Cambodia as well, but Mike Mansfield, who helped Cooper write the amendment, feared that Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was officially neutral in the conflict, might be offended. When Sihanouk was deposed in 1970, Cambodia's new leader, Lon Nol, appealed to President Nixon for help in stabilizing his rule. Nixon agreed to send troops to Cambodia, despite protests from Cooper and others that this violated his stated goal of de-escalation in the region. Cooper and Church then drafted another amendment to de-fund U.S. operations in Cambodia; after negotiations with Nixon that continued funding until July 1970 so that the troops already in the country could be evacuated, the amendment passed 58–37. The House of Representatives later stripped the amendment from the legislation to which it was attached, and it did not go into effect. The amendment was nevertheless hailed by The Washington Post as [...] "the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> history that Congress has attempted to limit the deployment of American troops in the course of an ongoing war." [...] The fight over the Cooper–Church Amendments took its toll on Cooper's health, and he was briefly hospitalized to regain his strength. In 1971, Church, Mansfield, and George Aiken convinced Cooper to help them write an amendment to end U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia altogether, but ultimately, the measure did not have the support to pass and was abandoned.|$|E

Independent Senator Joseph Lieberman lauded the speech and went on to remark, [...] "Obama is off to a very, very good start in a very difficult <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> nation's history." [...] A spokesman for Human Rights Watch stated that [...] "there were many things that were commendable ... but it is disappointing that when he talked about democracy in the Muslim world he wasn't more specific about some of the problems."

2500|$|The age of {{the citizen}} {{journalist}} and the providing of news photos by amateur bystanders {{have contributed to the}} art of [...] photojournalism.

[...] The empowered news audience {{with the advent of the}} Internet sparked the creation of blogs, podcasts and online news, independent of the traditional outlets, and [...] "for the first <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> history, the news increasingly is produced by companies outside journalism". Dan Chung, a former photojournalist for The Guardian and Reuters, believes that professional photojournalists will have to adapt to video to make a living.
