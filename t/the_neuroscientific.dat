25|$|Another {{approach}} to understanding <b>the</b> <b>neuroscientific</b> underpinnings {{of the sense}} of agency is to examine clinical conditions in which purposeful limb movement occurs without an associated sense of agency. The most clear clinical demonstration of this situation is alien hand syndrome. In this condition, associated with specific forms of brain damage, the affected individual loses the sense of agency without losing a sense of ownership of the affected body part.|$|E
25|$|Complementing this, {{afferent nerve}} fibres {{have been found}} that project to early visual {{areas such as the}} lingual gyrus from late in the dorsal (action) and ventral (perception) visual streams, {{as well as from the}} {{auditory}} association cortex. Feedback projections have also been observed in the opossum directly from the auditory association cortex to V1. This last observation currently highlights a point of controversy within <b>the</b> <b>neuroscientific</b> community. Sadato et al. (2004) concluded, in line with Bernstein et al. (2002), that the primary auditory cortex (A1) was functionally distinct from the auditory association cortex, in that it was void of any interaction with the visual modality. They hence concluded that A1 would not at all be effected by cross modal plasticity. This concurs with Jones and Powell's (1970) contention that primary sensory areas are connected only to other areas of the same modality.|$|E
25|$|At the {{cognitive}} level, cognitive neuroscience addresses {{the questions of}} how psychological functions are produced by neural circuitry. The emergence of powerful new measurement techniques such as neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI, PET, SPECT), electrophysiology, and human genetic analysis combined with sophisticated experimental techniques from cognitive psychology allows neuroscientists and psychologists to address abstract questions such as how human cognition and emotion are mapped to specific neural substrates. Although many studies still hold a reductionist stance looking for the neurobiological basis of cognitive phenomena, recent research shows {{that there is an}} interesting interplay between neuroscientific findings and conceptual research, soliciting and integrating both perspectives. For example, the neuroscience research on empathy solicited an interesting interdisciplinary debate involving philosophy, psychology and psychopathology. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>neuroscientific</b> identification of multiple memory systems related to different brain areas has challenged the idea of memory as a literal reproduction of the past, supporting a view of memory as a generative, constructive and dynamic process.|$|E

2500|$|Neural binding {{refers to}} <b>the</b> <b>neuroscientific</b> aspect {{of what is}} {{commonly}} known as the binding problem. The Binding Problem is an interdisciplinary term, named for the difficulty of creating a comprehensive and verifiable model for the unity of consciousness. [...] "Binding" [...] refers to the integration of highly diverse neural information in the forming of one's cohesive experience. The neural binding hypothesis states that neural signals are paired through synchronized oscillations of neuronal activity that combine and recombine to allow {{for a wide variety of}} responses to context-dependent stimuli. These dynamic neural networks are thought to account for the flexibility and nuanced response of the brain to various situations. The coupling of these networks is transient, on the order of milliseconds, and allows for rapid activity.|$|E

2500|$|Meditation-relaxation (MR) {{therapy is}} a {{published}} direct treatment for sleep paralysis. The treatment was partly derived from <b>the</b> <b>neuroscientific</b> hypothesis suggesting that attempting movement during sleep paralysis (e.g., due to panic-like reactions) {{can lead to}} neurological distortions of one's [...] "body image", possibly triggering hallucinations of shadowy human-like figures. The therapy is based on four steps applied during sleep paralysis: (1) reappraisal {{of the meaning of}} the attack (cognitive reappraisal); which entails closing one's eyes, avoid panicking and re-appraising the meaning of the attack as benign. (2) psychological and emotional distancing (emotion regulation); the sleeper reminds him- or herself that catastrophizing the event (i.e., fear and worry) will worsen and possibly prolong it; (3) inward focused-attention meditation; focusing attention inward on an emotionally salient positive object; 4) muscle relaxation; relaxing one's muscles, avoid controlling breathing and avoid attempting to move.There are preliminary case reports supporting this treatment, although no randomized clinical trials yet to show its effectiveness.|$|E

40|$|This {{commentary}} {{offers a}} reflection on <b>the</b> state of <b>neuroscientific</b> evidence, as revealed by four empirical studies recently published in the Journal of Law and the Biosciences. I suggest that these studies lead to four broad conclusions about {{the current state of}} neuroscientific evidence in criminal courts. First, neuroscientific evidence is being used more than in years past, but still being used quite infrequently. Second, the legal contexts in which neuroscientific evidence is proffered vary widely, both within and across countries. Third, prosecutors as well as criminal defense attorneys are introducing brain evidence. Fourth, differences in legal structures and legal doctrine help to explain some of the variation in <b>the</b> introduction of <b>neuroscientific</b> evidence. In <b>the</b> second part of the commentary, I consider a series of unanswered questions that the studies also raise. I finish in the third part of the commentary with a prediction: the future use of neuroscientific evidence in court will be similar to the use of instant replay in contemporary sports. That is, although neuroscientific evidence is likely to be used in {{only a small percentage of}} cases, it can still have a transformative impact. Like instant replay, neuroscientific evidence is more likely to be used when the stakes are high, and when judgments based on other observational data are on a borderline. And just as the use, and effect, of instant replay depends critically on the availability of proper camera angles, so too will <b>the</b> utility of <b>neuroscientific</b> evidence depend on the ability of medicine and science to provide brain data that is legally relevant. I expect that if this future comes to pass, then the legal system will – just as professional sports have – struggle at first. Ultimately, however, the law will find a workable solution to <b>the</b> use of <b>neuroscientific</b> evidence that will advance more just outcomes while not unduly delaying proceedings...|$|R
