Between 1924 and 1926, the Maryland State Roads Commission constructed approaches to the new bridge {{on both sides of}} the expanded canal, eliminating two narrow and dangerous bridges and four right-angle turns in Chesapeake City. The new route along George Street and Lock Street, which became part of US 213 in 1927 and is now MD 285 and MD 537, entirely bypassed what is now MD 284. After the tanker Franz Klasen destroyed the vertical lift bridge on July 28, 1942, the Maryland State Roads Commission established a ferry service across the canal. Between 1946 and 1949, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed the present <b>tied</b> <b>arch</b> Chesapeake City Bridge and new approach roads to the bridge.|$|E

25|$|The {{foundations}} were to {{be difficult}} because of the poor ground conditions in the river, and this ruled out an all-masonry structure, so cast iron or wrought iron was inevitable for the superstructure. A <b>tied</b> <b>arch</b> (or bow-string) design was favoured, because the outward thrust imposed by an arch is contained by the tie; no abutments capable of resisting the thrust could be provided here.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The rigid-frame <b>tied</b> through <b>arch</b> {{bridge is}} a main form in CFST arch bridge. Most {{of this type}} bridges have a single-span, in which the arch ribs are fixed to the piers to form a rigid frame and high {{strength}} strands are employed as tired bars by pre-stressed to produce horizontal compression forces to balance {{the thrust of the}} arch ribs. Some of them have more than one spans, three spans are the most popularity.

25|$|The {{construction}} of an arch bridge was viewed as wasteful in respect to the extra costs associated with building this type of bridge. Other designs which were less expensive in nature were rejected in favour of the more expensive <b>tied</b> <b>arch</b> design. Lupu Bridge became the first arch bridge across the Huangpu River in Shanghai and many feel its design is just a show piece for the city.|$|E

500|$|The {{new design}} {{utilizes}} basket-handle steel arches with clear spans of approximately [...] Inclined cables connect the steel blue arches to the pre-stressed concrete deck. By selecting a <b>tied</b> <b>arch</b> form, the Iowa Department of Transportation {{was able to}} keep disruption of traffic to a minimum during construction. An innovative curved screen system is used to enhance security and the appearance of the structure creating a visually appealing experience for pedestrians and bicyclists using the bridge. The resulting series of bridges has created a distinctive form that is unique to the city and the state. The city of Des Moines recently relit the bridges with LED lighting.|$|E
5000|$|The {{structure}} {{was formed by}} nine spans of 51.6 m, united with 6 m-wide concrete <b>tied</b> <b>arches.</b> Two 1 m sidewalks were built on each side with 1 m guard rails. The abutment was built over four-armed concrete cylinders that reached a depth of 12 m under the soil of the river. Each of the eight columns of the bridge were founded over two-armed concrete cylinders, with the depth of 12 m. The road was 6 m wide, while the bridge had a height of 15 m. On Neuquén's side, [...] of land were removed to create a ten-metre wide roadway. The {{total cost of the}} works, and compensations for expropriations amounted to ARS$920,700.|$|R

500|$|The highway begins {{just north}} of Moab at a {{junction}} with U.S. Route 191 near the southern boundary of Arches National Park. The road follows the north bank of the Colorado River to the potash mine. The road is legislatively designated north–south, but actually serpentines {{for most of its}} length. The highway loosely parallels a spur of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad built {{at the same time and}} for the same purpose of serving the potash mine. The route of the railroad features a [...] tunnel that bypasses most of the serpentine bends in the Colorado River between Moab and the potash plant. While in the Colorado River canyon, the highway passes by dinosaur footprints, Indian petroglyphs and jeep trails leading to Canyonlands National Park and Dead Horse Point State Park. The highway also passes by three named natural arches, Corona <b>Arch,</b> Bow <b>Tie</b> <b>Arch,</b> and Jug Handle Arch.|$|R
500|$|US77 faced more bridge {{problems}} at its other end. [...] In the late-1970s and early-1980s, a steel, <b>tied</b> <b>arch</b> bridge {{was built to}} replace the Combination Bridge, which opened in 1895. [...] The Siouxland Veterans Memorial Bridge opened to traffic in January 1981 and was dedicated months later on July 22. [...] This too, would not last long. [...] During routine bridge washing on May 6, 1982, an Iowa DOT worker discovered a [...] crack across a box girder. [...] The crack was approximately [...] wide and was rusted, which told the workers it {{had been there for}} some time. [...] The bridge was immediately closed down for repairs. [...] Traffic was rerouted south to cross the Missouri at the I-129 bridge. [...] The bridge would not be fully opened again until May 1983.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Stephenson had bridged the River Conwy (1848) and the Menai Straits (1850) with spans of 400 and [...] respectively, using large box-girder {{sections}} of riveted wrought iron. Conwy-like box-girders {{would have been}} very expensive to use at Chepstow as well as being heavy (problematic, since the spans had to be lifted much higher than at Conwy). Brunel, characteristically, sought a radical solution. He had already built a bowstring or <b>tied</b> <b>arch</b> bridge at Windsor (1849) consisting of three triangular cross-section cellular arch ribs [...] "strung" [...] by wrought iron deck girders supported by vertical hangers from the arches. This was the same year as Stephenson's <b>tied</b> <b>arch</b> High Level Bridge at Newcastle upon Tyne, which was supposed to have influenced Brunel at Chepstow. However, Brunel's solution for the latter was to make a leap forward, based, nevertheless, on sound engineering principles and a variation of the tied-arch theme.|$|E

50|$|Like many through arch bridges, {{the design}} of the bridge is often {{confused}} with the tied-arch bridge; many bridges have both characteristics.

At Stanley Ferry, the outward sideways thrust of the arch is retained by its abutments, as for the simple arch bridge.|$|R

40|$|The Rock Island Centennial Bridge {{spanning}} the Mississippi River between Rock Island, Illinois and Davenport, Iowa was opened to traffic on July 12, 1940. It is a thoroughly modern, four-lane highway bridge, adequate {{in every respect}} for present day high speed passenger and transport traffic. The structure is ideally situated to provide rapid transit between the business districts of Rock Island and Davenport and serves not only the local or shuttle traffic in the Tri-City Area, but also heavy through motor travel on U. S. Highways 67 and 150. The Centennial Bridge is notable in several respects. The main spans are box girder rib <b>tied</b> <b>arches,</b> a type rather unusual in America and permitting simplicity in design with pleasing appearance. The Centennial Bridge is the only bridge across the Mississippi providing for four lanes of traffic with separation of traffic in each direction. It is a toll bridge operating alongside a free bridge and has the lowest rates of toll of any toll bridge on the Mississippi River. It was financed entirely by the City of Rock Island with no obligation on the taxpayers; there was no federal or state participation in the financing. But perhaps the most outstanding feature of the new bridge is its great need. A few remarks on the communities served by the new structure, the services rendered, and some statistics on cross-river traffic in the Tri-City Area will emphasize the reasons for constructing the Centennial Bridge...|$|R
