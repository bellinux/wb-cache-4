40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a patient with}} chronic granulocytic leukaemia who developed cataracts on busulphan treatment. Following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, he developed cytomegalovirus retinitis, which was treated successfully with <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphonoformate</b> (foscarnet). Cytomegalovirus retinitis and its therapy, and busulphan-induced cataract are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Thirteen {{established}} anti-herpes compounds {{have been}} directly compared {{in a single}} assay system for their effects {{on the development of}} herpetic skin lesions, and mortality associated therewith, in athymic nude (nu/nu) mice inoculated intracutaneously with herpes simplex virus type 1 (KOS). When applied topically (at 1 % in a water-soluble ointment), phosphonoacetic acid, E- 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) - 2 '-deoxyuridine, acycloguanosine, and <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphonoformate</b> emerged as the most active agents. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|When applied topically, <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphonoformate</b> (PFA) {{displayed}} activity against established cutaneous herpesvirus {{infections in}} guinea pigs {{similar to that}} exhibited by the closely related phosphonoacetic acid (PAA); however, unlike PAA, PFA was not locally skin irritating. The therapeutic benefits of topical application of PFA were clearly evident when application was delayed for 48 h after virus inoculation, at which time lesions were well developed. The therapeutic effect was dependent on the concentration of PFA and the duration of treatment. PFA exhibited significant activity against established infections when administered intraperitoneally, although it was less effective via this systemic route than when applied topically...|$|E
40|$|Human T-lymphotropic virus type III is {{susceptible}} to attack at various sites during its replicative cycle. Inhibitors of reverse transcriptase activity, including suramin, antimoniotungstate (HPA- 23), and <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphonoformate,</b> have shown in-vitro activity against the virus in early clinical trials. Other significant antiviral agents are recombinant interferon alpha-A, ribavirin, and ansamycin. Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of interferon alpha, which inhibits viral replication at easily achievable serum levels, are underway. The development of optimal therapeutic regimens will require carefully controlled, multicenter collaborative trials with standardized criteria for evaluating responses. Prolonged treatment with combinations of antiviral and immunomodulating agents may be necessary for contro...|$|E
40|$|The {{antiviral}} compound <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphonoformate</b> (PFA), which inhibits herpesvirus multiplication by 50 % at {{a concentration}} of 10 Î¼M, did not show any effects on macromolecular synthesis and cell proliferation in HeLa and human lung cells at this concentration. At the high concentration of 2 mM, PFA reduced DNA synthesis to 50 % after 1 h of treatment, whereas no effects could be seen on RNA and protein synthesis. Treatment for 24 h with 1 mM PFA inhibited both DNA synthesis and cell proliferation to 50 %. The inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell proliferation at 10 mM PFA was rapidly reversed by removing the drug from the cells...|$|E
40|$|Safe and {{effective}} treatments for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection {{have yet to}} be developed. Both ganciclovir (9 -[1, 3 -dihydroxy- 2 -propoxymethyl]guanine) and foscarnet (<b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphonoformate</b> hexahydrate) are potent inhibitors of hepadnavirus replication when used individually in vitro and in vivo. However, the clinical usefulness of each drug is reduced by dose-limiting toxicity, especially during long-term monotherapy. Here we demonstrate additive inhibition of duck HBV DNA replication in cultures of primary duck hepatocytes congenitally infected with duck HBV by combinations of ganciclovir and foscarnet at low, clinically achievable concentrations. These results suggest that the effects of ganciclovir and foscarnet against HBV may be additive in vivo...|$|E
40|$|A double blind, placebo {{controlled}} {{trial was}} performed in nine sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinics in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to investigate the efficacy of <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphonoformate</b> (foscarnet) cream in treating recurrent genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The study group comprised 145 male and 85 female patients. Men received 0. 3 % foscarnet cream and women 1 % foscarnet cream for five days. The difference in time to healing between patients receiving foscarnet or placebo was not significant. Fewer patients treated with foscarnet had positive viral cultures after treatment, but {{the difference was not}} significant. The development of new lesions, however, was significantly less common in patients given foscarnet. Though topical foscarnet is a safe drug, no appreciable efficacy in treating recurrent genital HSV infection could be shown...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacodynamic}} {{relationship between}} a range of foscarnet exposure measurements obtained from studying nine patients receiving ongoing maintenance therapy for cytomegalovirus retinitis {{and a range of}} efficacy values (days to retinitis progression) obtained by independent examination of serial retinal photo-graphs from the same nine patients was analyzed. In the resulting proportional hazards models, the foscarnet area under the concentration-time curve approached statistical significance (P = 0. 11) as a predictor of decreased risk of retinitis progression. Foscarnet (<b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphonoformate)</b> is an effective antiviral agent for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in immunocompromised patients (5, 8, 11). In a large randomized trial of initial antiviral treatment for AIDS-related CMV retinitis, this drug had efficacy equivalent to that of ganciclovir (the only other drug currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CMV disease); however, patients assigned to the foscarnet treatment group survived longer (11). Foscarnet treatment for CM...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficient}} in vitro inhibition of hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase by <b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphonoformate</b> (PFA, INN: foscarnet sodium) and its low toxicity suggested that PFA {{could be used}} as a therapeutic agent for hepatitis B infection. PFA was also found to inhibit woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) DNA polymerase in vitro. As a model to test PFA's eventual effect, chronically WHV infected woodchucks were treated with PFA. The animals were treated twice daily in a dosage which gave a minimum serum level of PFA corresponding to an in vitro inhibiting effect on WHV DNA polymerase of about 40 %. The concentration in liver tissue was found to be 15 % below serum level. The amount of WHV particles in serum was followed by DNA polymerase assay. No effect on WHV production could be seen during 2 weeks' treatment. No change of the in vitro sensitivity to PFA of the WHV DNA polymerase was seen. These results indicate that the WHV associated DNA polymerase has no role in the production of viral particles...|$|E
40|$|Foscarnet (<b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphonoformate</b> hexahydrate) is an {{antiviral}} agent used {{to treat}} cytomegalovirus disease in immunocompromised patients. One common side effect is acute ionized hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia following intravenous administration. Foscarnet-induced ionized hypomagnesemia might contribute to ionized hypocalcemia by impairing excretion of preformed parathyroid hormone (PTH) or by producing target organ resistance. Prevention of ionized hypomagnesemia following foscarnet administration could blunt the development of ionized hypocalcemia. To determine whether intravenous magnesium ameliorates the decline in ionized calcium and/or magnesium following foscarnet infusions, MgSO 4 at doses of 1, 2, and 3 g was administered in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial to 12 patients with AIDS and cytomegalovirus disease. Overall, increasing doses of MgSO 4 reduced or eliminated foscarnet-induced acute ionized hypomagnesemia. Supplementation, however, had no discernible effect on foscarnet-induced ionized hypocalcemia despite significant increases in serum PTH levels. No dose-related, clinically significant adverse events were found, suggesting that intravenous supplementation with up to 3 g of MgSO 4 was safe in this chronically ill population. Since parenteral MgSO 4 did not alter foscarnet-induced ionized hypocalcemia or symptoms associated with foscarnet, routine intravenous supplementation for patients with normal serum magnesium levels is not recommended during treatment with foscarnet...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{cell line}} (termed BCBL- 1) {{derived from a}} {{peripheral}} effusion (body cavity-based) lymphoma latently infected with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), we recently reported the successful induction of KSHV replication in culture (Renne, R., W. Zhong, B. Herndier, M. McGrath, N. Abbey, D. Kedes, and D. Ganem. 1996. Nat. Med. 2 : 342 - 346). Here we report the first use of this system for establishing the susceptibility of KSHV to available antiviral drugs. Latently infected BCBL- 1 cells were induced to lytic replication with phorbol esters; such cells secrete large numbers of KSHV virions into the culture medium. We assayed {{the ability of the}} antivirals to block KSHV production, as measured by the release of encapsidated viral DNA. The results show that KSHV replication is insensitive to acyclovir (9 -[(2 -hydroxyethoxy) -methyl]guanine) (50 % inhibitory concentration [IC 50] = 60 - 80 microM), but sensitive to ganciclovir (9 -[1, 3 -dihydroxy- 2 -propoxymethyl]guanine) (IC 50 = 2. 7 - 4 microM), foscarnet (<b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphonoformate</b> hexahydrate) (IC 50 = 80 - 100 microM), and cidofovir (1 -[(S) - 3 -hydroxy- 2 -(phosphonomethoxy) propyl]cytosine) (IC 50 = 0. 5 - 1 microM) ...|$|E
40|$|Foscarnet sodium (<b>trisodium</b> <b>phosphonoformate</b> hexahydrate) {{has been}} shown to inhibit herpes simplex virus (HSV) in vitro and to be efficacious for topical {{treatment}} of experimental HSV infection in animals. To assess its clinical efficacy in the treatment of recurrent orolabial herpes a multicentre collaborative, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. The study patients were randomly assigned to receive either 3 % foscarnet cream (78 patients) or placebo (cream vehicle) (75 patients) and were asked to start treatment at the earliest indication of a recurrence. Efficacy was evaluated in 143 patients (74 in the foscarnet group and 69 in the placebo group). There {{was no significant difference in}} time to healing or duration of virus shedding between the two groups. However, in the subgroup of patients who started treatment before vesicles appeared, the duration of virus shedding was shorter in the foscarnet group than in the placebo group (p = 0. 04), and the proportion of lesions that evolved to the vesicular stage was smaller (p = 0. 03). No significant difference in the incidence of local or systemic adverse effects was noted between the two groups. We conclude that the beneficial effect of foscarnet was limited to a subgroup of patients who started treatment in the prevesicular stage...|$|E
