5|$|The game's release at a $39.99 {{price in}} the United States was seen by some reviewers as being <b>too</b> <b>expensive.</b>|$|E
5|$|A key {{innovation}} in the Brazilian flex technology was avoiding {{the need for an}} additional dedicated sensor to monitor the ethanol-gasoline mix, which made the first American M85 flex fuel vehicles <b>too</b> <b>expensive.</b>|$|E
5|$|According {{to transit}} {{advocate}} Steve Munro, the SSE {{will be built}} to use only automatic train control. This would preclude the operation of T1 subway cars on the extension {{as it would be}} <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> to convert T1 cars to ATC.|$|E

50|$|Although Nippon Kogaku {{enjoyed a}} {{sterling}} reputation among professional photographers with their Nikon F2 of 1971, the F2 was far <b>too</b> massive, <b>expensive</b> and complicated for most amateurs and beginners.|$|R
25|$|Until release 12, Rfam used {{an initial}} BLAST {{filtering}} step because profile SCFGs were <b>too</b> computationally <b>expensive.</b> However, the latest versions of INFERNAL are fast {{enough so that}} the BLAST step is no longer necessary.|$|R
5|$|The {{production}} of silk through sericulture was profitable for both small-time farmers and large-scale producers. Silk clothing was <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> for the poor, who wore clothes most commonly made of hemp. The rural women usually wove all the family's clothes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1891, Berkman {{learned that}} Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, whom he admired, had {{canceled}} an American speaking tour {{on the basis that}} it was <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> for the struggling anarchist movement. While Berkman was disappointed, the frugality of the action further elevated Kropotkin's stature in his eyes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the meeting}} for the Formula One Commission in Geneva in November 2011, the use of helium in air guns used to change tyres during pit stops was banned. Despite {{increasing}} the rotation speed of the air guns by up to 30%, the practice of using helium was deemed to be <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> to continue for the competitive gains it offered.|$|E

50|$|In a biplane age it {{was judged}} <b>too</b> radical and <b>expensive,</b> so no {{production}} order was awarded.|$|R
50|$|Phenetics {{has largely}} been {{superseded}} by cladistics for research into evolutionary relationships among species. However, certain phenetic methods, such as neighbor-joining, have {{found their way into}} phylogenetics, as a reasonable approximation of phylogeny when more advanced methods (such as Bayesian inference) are <b>too</b> computationally <b>expensive.</b>|$|R
5|$|Henry Tufton died in 1849, and castle {{ownership}} fell to Hothfields. Maintenance was <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> for the family, and by 1859 cattle {{were being}} kept in its gatehouse, and visitors complained that {{parts of the}} romantic ruin had become inaccessible. Without sufficient funds, the castle quickly fell into marked decay.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Richard Garfield {{approached}} Wizards of the Coast {{with the}} idea for a new board game called RoboRally, but was turned down because the game would have been <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> for Wizards of the Coast to produce. Instead, Adkison asked Garfield if he could invent a game that was both portable and quick-playing, to which Garfield agreed.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the {{transport}} authorities of Oslo decided to close Nordberg and Frøen stations, {{on the grounds}} that these stations were <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> to maintain. The platforms at Vestgrensa were moved a few metres to adjust to the metro trains. Seven years later, on 22 August 1999, Vestgrensa was closed and replaced with the newly opened Forskningsparken Station.|$|E
50|$|About 1990, {{the company}} moved to Nevada from Pomona, California, {{complaining}} that California's economic regulations were <b>too</b> strict and <b>expensive.</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the analysis of}} continuous gravitational waves from neutron stars with non-axisymmetric rotational motion using data from ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors, {{the development of a}} computationally efficient algorithm for analysis of this data and the use of this algorithm in follow up searches, which were previously <b>too</b> computationally <b>expensive</b> to consider...|$|R
5|$|In the event, the {{north-western}} corner was leased to the Bank of England and Norwich Union Insurance (whose offices {{now stand}} derelict), {{and the critical}} corner site where the Dutch House had stood {{was replaced by a}} link road to a short section of dual-carriageway linking High Street with Wine Street. Plans for a civic centre were dropped as being <b>too</b> <b>expensive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Noé {{first tried}} to get the film funded in the early 2000s. Several {{producers}} responded positively to the script, and it was briefly under development for Tom Tykwer's German company X-Filme Creative Pool. It was considered <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> and the producers dropped out. Prospects changed when Irréversible (2002) became a commercial success. Noé had written and directed Irréversible for StudioCanal, and it was sold internationally by their subsidiary, Wild Bunch. When the producers at Wild Bunch asked Noé {{what he wanted to do}} next, he answered Enter the Void. The project was once again considered <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> in relation to its commercial potential, but when Wild Bunch discovered that Noé had started to develop the film for Pathé instead of them, they said that they were willing to fund it. Since development went slowly at Pathé, Noé chose to not renew his contract with the studio and accepted Wild Bunch's offer.|$|E
5|$|Since Close Encounters {{was filmed}} anamorphically, the visual effects {{sequences}} were shot on 70 mm film to better conform with the 35 mm film {{used for the}} rest of the movie. A test reel using computer-generated imagery was used for the UFOs, but Spielberg found it would be <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> and ineffective since CGI was in its infancy in the mid-1970s.|$|E
25|$|While HSL, HSV, {{and related}} spaces serve well enough to, for instance, choose a single color, they ignore {{much of the}} {{complexity}} of color appearance. Essentially, they trade off perceptual relevance for computation speed, from a time in computing history (high-end 1970s graphics workstations, or mid-1990s consumer desktops) when more sophisticated models would have been <b>too</b> computationally <b>expensive.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} in North America on February 8, 2011. Jellyvision Games has stated they considered further international releases, but these would be <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> at the present time. The company does not rule out future iterations of the game being released to a wider market based {{on the success of}} this title.|$|E
5|$|The opening was {{rejected}} as <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> to film; Flinn mentioned the exotic locales would {{have pushed the}} budget to $50million. While they tried {{to hold on to}} the opening as long as they could, Paramount threatened to cancel pre-production unless a few million dollars were cut from the budget.|$|E
5|$|Titanium metal {{is used in}} {{automotive}} applications, {{particularly in}} automobile and motorcycle racing where low weight and high strength and rigidity are critical. The metal is generally <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> for the general consumer market, though some late model Corvettes have been manufactured with titanium exhausts, and a Corvette Z06's LT4 supercharged engine uses lightweight, solid titanium intake valves for greater strength and resistance to heat.|$|E

50|$|When {{developing}} a floppy drive for the Apple II, Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Wozniak {{felt that the}} existing ones available on the market were <b>too</b> complicated, <b>expensive</b> and inefficient. Rather than adopting the existing floppy drivesfrom Alan Shugart, Wozniak decided to keep only the drive mechanics and to develop his own electronics for both the drive {{as well as the}} controller.|$|R
5|$|Amtrak {{established}} a separate maintenance facility for all six trainsets in the Brighton Park neighborhood of Chicago, {{on the site}} of a former Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad coach yard. This facility closed in 1981 after the withdrawal of the RTGs from service; according to Amtrak, the trainsets were <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> to operate compared to conventional equipment. The trainsets were mothballed at Amtrak's main maintenance facility in Beech Grove, Indiana. A contributing factor to the withdrawal was the spike in fuel prices after the Yom Kippur War.|$|E
5|$|Bosi had {{previously}} been head chef and won a Michelin star at the Overton Grange restaurant, just outside the town. He had intended to open a restaurant in Warwickshire, but found the premises <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> and purchased a 25-year lease on the former Oaks property in Ludlow for £40,000. Within a year Hibiscus won its first Michelin star, {{and at the same}} time Overton Grange was downgraded before going into receivership.|$|E
5|$|Gatiss {{originally}} resisted having Dickens {{star in the}} episode, as {{traditionally the}} Doctor only mentioned meeting historical figures, but he eventually warmed to the idea. As A Christmas Carol fan, Gatiss wanted to set the episode at Christmas. He later realised that Dickens' journey in the episode mirrored that of Ebenezer Scrooge. In one scene, Gatiss wanted the knocker on a door behind Dickens to briefly show the Gelth's face in reference to A Christmas Carol, but this visual effect was not done. The episode originally began in the TARDIS, as Gatiss wanted the first glimpse of 1860 to be through Rose's eyes. While this changed, Gatiss still wanted to show how great travelling in time is. It was scripted that snow would blow into the TARDIS when the doors opened, but this was cut because of budget reasons. Davies requested {{a scene in which}} the Doctor takes Rose to the future to see a world filled with walking corpses— the result if they had left before defeating the Gelth— but this was <b>too</b> <b>expensive</b> to film. During the scene in which the Doctor and Dickens are talking in the coach, the driver was supposed to shout down to them (referencing a Dickens work) and the coach was to crash, but this was also <b>too</b> <b>expensive.</b>|$|E
50|$|For more {{complicated}} systems, {{calculation of the}} energy of a particular arrangement of atoms is often <b>too</b> computationally <b>expensive</b> for large scale representations of the surface to be feasible. For these systems a possible approach is to calculate only a reduced set of points on the PES and then use a computationally cheaper interpolation method, for example Shepard interpolation, {{to fill in the}} gaps.|$|R
50|$|Waters, in a 2008 interview, {{stated that}} the songs used in the film were taken right {{out of his own}} record collection. Waters says he did not pay the proper {{licensing}} fees to use these songs because he could not afford to. It is because of this, Waters says, that Mondo Trasho remains unreleased, as the still unsecured music rights would be <b>too</b> prohibitively <b>expensive</b> to clear.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Standard {{empirical}} likelihood for U-statistics is <b>too</b> computationally <b>expensive.</b> To {{overcome this}} computational difficulty, we reformulate the empirical likelihood for non-degenerate U-statistics {{in terms of}} “pseudo ” mean in this paper, and show that the empirical log-likelihood ratio has an asymptotic chi-squared distribution under second moment condition. The method is extremely simple to use, and yet provide better coverage accuracy in general than other alternative methods from our simulation studies...|$|R
