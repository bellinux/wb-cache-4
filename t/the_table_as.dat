5|$|Aberdeen's {{first and}} only foreign manager, Ebbe Skovdahl, was {{appointed}} in 1999 and his time in charge coincided {{with some of the}} heaviest defeats in the club's history. The low point of the club's history came in the 1999–2000 season, where they finished bottom of <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>As</b> the Scottish Premier League was being expanded to twelve teams, there was then a three team play-off. However, as Falkirk's stadium did not meet SPL requirements, Aberdeen retained their status in the top flight. This was followed by an early-season defeat to Ireland's Bohemian F.C. on the away goals rule in the next season's UEFA Cup.|$|E
5|$|Following the season, Evra was {{recruited}} by Nice's Derby de la Côte d'Azur rivals Monaco. Despite wanting {{to play as}} a left winger again, Evra was advised by manager Didier Deschamps he would only play as a left back. Evra has since credited Deschamps for allowing {{him to become a}} better defender after initially describing the role as being not fun. Evra was inserted into a back four that consisted of centre-backs Rafael Márquez and Sébastien Squillaci and right-back Franck Jurietti. Evra was assigned the number 3 shirt and made his debut for the club in the opening match of the 2002–03 season against Troyes. He played the entire match in a 4–0 win. On 28 September, Evra scored his first goal for the club, scoring the match-winner in a 2–1 victory against Rennes. On 22 March 2003, he scored his second goal of the season in a 3–0 away win over Le Havre. The victory allowed Monaco to maintain its position at the top of <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> <b>as</b> the club was in a three-way battle with Lyon and Marseille. Monaco climatically conceded first place to Lyon in May, which resulted in Lyon being declared champions {{for the second time in}} its history. Monaco finished the campaign in second place, which merited the club an appearance in the UEFA Champions League. The club was also rewarded domestically for its performance in the Coupe de la Ligue where it reached the final. Evra featured in the team's 4–1 win over Sochaux in the match. The league cup title gave Evra the first major honour of his career.|$|E
5|$|York won for {{the first}} time in 13 matches after beating Portsmouth 3–1 at home, but were left nine points adrift of safety with three matches remaining. Fewster headed York into the lead on 30 minutes and Alessandra scored with a low shot four minutes later. Summerfield made it 3–0 three minutes after half-time with a 30-yard shot, before Portsmouth scored a {{consolation}} goal through Gareth Evans in the 55th minute. York's relegation into the National League was confirmed after a 3–0 away defeat to Accrington, marking the end of a four-year spell in the Football League. Promotion-chasing Accrington opened the scoring in the first half through Tariqe Fosu, before Josh Windass scored twice in the second half. York were beaten 4–1 by promotion-chasing Bristol Rovers in their last home match of the season, dropping to the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>as</b> a result. Billy Bodin scored Rovers' first two goals before Jermaine Easter and Lee Mansell scored either side of McEvoy's 81st-minute goal, a close-range finish from Fewster's low cross from the left. Before the match, Winfield was named the 2015–16 Clubman of the Year, voted for by the club's supporters. York's last match of the season was a 1–1 away draw with Morecambe, in which they took the lead after Summerfield scored in first-half stoppage time, before the home team equalised through Jamie Devitt. This meant York's final league position in 2015–16 was bottom place, being relegated alongside 23rd-place Dagenham.|$|E

There was to be no repeat however, the following season, a season that saw Rovers knocked out by League Two side AFC Bournemouth {{in the very first}} round of the competition's proper.
