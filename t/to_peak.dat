40|$|Covariations in {{neuronal}} latency or excitability {{can lead}} <b>to</b> <b>peaks</b> in spike train covariograms {{which may be}} {{very similar to those}} caused by spike timing synchronization (Brody, 1998). Two quantitative methods are described here: (1) A method to estimate the excitability component of a covariogram, based on trial-bytrial estimates of excitability. Once estimated, this component may be subtracted from the covariogram, leaving only other types of contributions. (2) A method to determine whether the covariogram could potentially have been caused by latency covariations. 1 Introduction A companion paper (Brody, 1998) has described how covariations in neuronal latency or excitability can lead <b>to</b> <b>peaks</b> in covariograms 2 that are very similar <b>to</b> <b>peaks</b> caused by spike synchronization. Since such peaks should be interpreted very differently <b>to</b> spike synchronization <b>peaks,</b> it is important to tell them apart. This note describes two methods which attempt to do this.

5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Edouard quickly strengthened {{due to the}} establishment of an upper-level anticyclone over the storm. The storm moved to the west in response to a strong subtropical ridge to its north, and Edouard strengthened into a hurricane on August 23. Due to very favorable conditions, the hurricane rapidly strengthened on August 24 and August 25 <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> as a 145mph (230km/h) Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed for a motion more to the west-northwest, and the hurricane passed about 250mi (400km) north of the Lesser Antilles on August 28. For three days during this time, Edouard maintained Category4 intensity, though weakened late on August 28 due to an eyewall replacement cycle and vertical shear.|$|E
5|$|Domoina {{developed}} on January16 off the northeast coast of Madagascar. With a ridge to the north, the storm tracked generally westward and later southwestward.

5|$|Hurricane Alma {{was one of}} {{only four}} Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclones to reach hurricane status in the month of May.

It stalled south of Cuba and deteriorated due to wind shear, and by May22 it weakened to tropical depression status. After progressing northwestward and crossing western Cuba, Alma reorganized in the Gulf of Mexico, although continued shear prevented strengthening. It moved across Florida on May25, and on May27 it dissipated off the coast of Virginia.|$|E

The third tropical cyclone of the season, Carlotta developed from a tropical wave on June 18 about 270miles (470km) southeast {{off the coast of}} Mexico. With favorable conditions for development, it strengthened steadily at first, followed by a period of rapid deepening <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> winds of 155mph (250km/h) on June 22. Cooler waters caused Carlotta to gradually weaken, and on June 25 it degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure while located about 260miles (420km) west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ginger was {{the second}} longest-lasting Atlantic {{hurricane}} on record.

Twenty of those days (September 11 – September 30), Ginger was classified as a hurricane. The storm formed northeast of the Bahamas, {{and for the first}} nine days of its duration tracked generally eastward or northeastward while gradually strengthening <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> winds of 110mph (175km/h). On September14, Ginger slowed and turned to a general westward track, passing near Bermuda on September23. There, the hurricane produced gusty winds and high waves, but no damage.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lily was a {{short-lived}} Category 1 hurricane of August 1971 that devastated {{the city of}} Puerto Vallarta in Mexico. Forming from an area of cloudiness associated with former Atlantic Tropical Storm Chloe, the storm slowly intensified, building <b>to</b> <b>peak</b> intensity just before landfall northwest of Manzanillo, Colima on August 31. The hurricane quickly weakened and became extratropical. After leaving land, the extratropical remnants of Lily dissipated on September 1. The storm's movement close to land affected shipping due to the limited warning, which was partially set back due to difficulties in clarifying the hurricane's position on radar from reconnaissance aircraft.|$|E
