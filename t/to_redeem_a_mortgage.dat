5000|$|Stash Hotel Rewards' {{main product}} {{offering}} is a loyalty reward {{program for a}} network of nearly 200 independent hotels in the United States (including Hawaii), Panama, and the Caribbean (including Turks and Caicos). It is free {{to sign up for}} the program, and guests who enroll are awarded 5 points for every dollar spent at in-network hotels. Those points can then be <b>redeemed</b> for <b>a</b> free stay at any in-network hotel, and there are no blackout or expiration dates. Stash differs from most traditional loyalty programs in that it allows individual properties to set the amount of points required <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> <b>a</b> free night. For instance, a hotel in-season may increase the amount of points required <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> <b>a</b> free stay while an out-of-season hotel may decrease the amount. Stash also offers the Stash Hotel Rewards Visa Card which allows Stash enrollees to earn points at hotels {{regardless of whether or not}} it's in the Stash network. When guests book a non-Stash hotel with the credit card, they are rewarded 2 points per dollar spent. The card also provides an additional 3 reward points per dollar spent (a total of 8 points) when used to book a hotel in the Stash network. The card was developed in association with Synchrony Financial.|$|R

50|$|Gold Coast Hotel & Casino v. United States, 158 F.3d 484 (9th Cir. 1998) was a {{court case}} that {{addressed}} whether a casino, using the accrual method of accounting, could deduct the value of slot club points earned by slot club members in the tax {{year in which the}} members accumulated the minimum points required <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> <b>a</b> prize, or whether the casino had to wait to deduct the value of the slot club points until the members actually redeemed them.|$|R
25|$|On 1 July 2008 a major {{overhaul}} of the programme was announced.

Additionally, the Frequent Flyer store was also expanded to include a greater range of products and services.|$|R

6000|$|Haldane smiled good-humoredly; but, {{in spite}} of this, his face was inscrutable. [...] "'When I might at least have run the price up,' you wish to add. Well, I had <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> <b>a</b> promise made {{somewhat}} against my better judgment, and I stopped--when it seemed advisable. This, as you may discover, Ormesby, {{is not the end}} of the affair, and, if I could have helped you judiciously, you may be sure that I would. In the meantime, are you coming back to Bonaventure with me?" ...|$|R
50|$|Set {{twenty years}} after the Bloody Mary Virus (released in the {{original}} Headhunter), Jack and his new partner Leeza X find out something is amiss {{when they try to}} stop Weapon Smugglers.

50|$|With {{first and}} second places pretty much decided, an {{interesting}} battle was shaping up between alternate strategy runners Tracy and Junqueira for the final podium spot. Tracy was looking <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> <b>a</b> rough patch of races while Junqueira was looking for his third consecutive podium finish. Unfortunately for Tracy, he used too much fuel to stay ahead and had to dive to the pits for fuel on the white flag lap. To {{add insult to injury}} he stalled the car and ended the race in ninth, the last lead lap runner.|$|R

50|$|A {{refreshing}} {{economy of}} style is visible throughout the film, whether establishing the love between Devdas and Parvati or conveying his anguish through the piercing {{sounds of the}} speeding train that takes him on his final tragic tryst with Parvati. The great physical distance that separates them and Devdas anxiety <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> <b>a</b> promise is skillfully conveyed through some stunning use of parallel cutting. The sequence of Devdas crying out in delirium, Parvati stumbling and then Devdas falling from his berth in the train was commended for its essential 'Indianness' in conveying fate's domination over individual destiny.|$|R
50|$|In 1869 he was {{appointed}} minister of finance. On taking office, he was confronted with a deficit in the revenue, which he successfully cleared off by effecting a conversion of a greater {{part of the state}} loans. The Franco-Prussian War indemnity enabled him <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> <b>a</b> considerable portion of the state debt and to remit certain taxes. He was, however, a too warm adherent of free trade principles to enjoy the confidence either of the Agrarian Party or of Prince Otto von Bismarck, and his antagonism to the tobacco monopoly and the general economic policy of the latter brought about his retirement.|$|R
50|$|Not a Cornfield was {{a living}} {{sculpture}} {{that consisted of}} a cornfield planted on a 32-acre piece {{of land in the}} centre of Los Angeles. This cornfield was stewarded by Lauren Bon and a large team of collaborators and volunteers for a full agricultural cycle in 2005 - 2006. The project was founded upon <b>a</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> <b>a</b> plot of once fertile and now depleted and derelict urban territory, as a symbol of renewal and hope. It was also designed to expedite the process of turning the site, owned by the State of California, into a State Historic Park.|$|R
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} his stint, Harris {{shifted his}} focus to the {{probability}} game Keno, for which he developed a program that would determine which numbers the game's pseudorandom number generator would select beforehand. When Harris' accomplice, Reid Errol McNeal, attempted <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> <b>a</b> high value winning keno ticket at Bally's Atlantic City Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey, casino executives became suspicious of him and notified New Jersey gaming investigators. The investigation led authorities to Harris and after a trial was sentenced to seven years in prison. [...] He was released from prison after serving two years and currently resides in Las Vegas.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed he did not," [...] said Wallace. [...] "Surely you misjudge his character. His {{converse}} with me was entirely religious, and his chief anxiety {{seemed to be}} to impress on me the love of God in sending Jesus Christ <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> <b>a</b> wicked world from sin. I tried to turn the conversation {{on the state of}} the times, but he gently turned it round again to the importance of being at peace with God, and giving heed to the condition of my own soul. He became at last so personal that I did not quite like it. Yet he was so earnest and kind that I could not take offence." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{revival of}} republican {{political}} philosophy has certainly impacted upon many different areas. Obviously, its main contribution is on politics. However, contemporary republican theory actually fails <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> <b>an</b> autonomous conception of politics. Despite {{the recognition of}} the central role of contestation, republican political theory either moralises or legalises politics. In this way, all the epistemic and normative potential of the idea of contestation is attenuated, up to a point where this idea does not add a particular value to republicanism. Astonishingly, there is no discussion of constituent power; but if republican political theory wants to remain true to its own aspirations, it has take into account the reflexive dimension of politics...|$|R
50|$|The {{middle part}} {{concerns}} Peter's family, which {{on the advice}} of their doctor sends him to a local monastery which also operates a pilgrimage church and a bar/restaurant; Jakobus, a monk who in a previous life was active in the city, is charged with attempting to understand what happened to Peter in Russia and why he is as traumatized as he apparently is. The young woman who runs the bar develops a friendship with him; as it turns out she has also been traumatized and has been taken in <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> <b>a</b> sexually compromised past. The section ends with Peter's return to his family after {{what appears to be a}} group of ghosts terrorizes the monastery.|$|R
60|$|As {{regards the}} {{scientific}} attainments of the French, it is unnecessary to say anything; though I believe you {{will admit that}} they ought at least to {{have the effect of}} counteracting some of the prejudices about dancing-masters, petits maîtres, and perruquiers, that have descended to us, through English novels and plays. Such a man as Laplace, alone, is sufficient <b>to</b> <b>redeem</b> <b>an</b> entire people from these imputations. The very sight of one of his demonstrations will give common men, like ourselves, headaches, and you will remember that having successfully got through one of the toughest of them, he felicitated himself that there was but one other man living who could comprehend it, now it was made.|$|R
