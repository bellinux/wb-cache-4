5|$|At E3 2015, Square Enix Montreal {{announced}} Lara Croft Go, {{a successor}} to Hitman Go set within the Tomb Raider universe. It was released on 27 August 2015. In the game, players use touchscreen controls to move Lara Croft around a level composed of nodes and lines. While the core mechanics and design are similar to Hitman Go, the developers did not want Lara Croft Go <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> re-skin, so an emphasis {{has been placed on}} the puzzle-driven exploration and gameplay elements of the Tomb Raider brand. The following year, Square Enix Montreal announced a similar title Deus Ex Go, based on the Deus Ex series.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{designed}} to have a future-retro look, with heavy use of grey tones to give a dreary, stagnant feel to totalitarian London. The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cross between a crypt and an undercroft. The Gallery is V's home {{as well as the}} place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, Bacchus and Ariadne by Titian, a Mildred Pierce poster, St. Sebastian by Andrea Mantegna, The Lady of Shalott by John William Waterhouse and statues by Giacometti.|$|E

5000|$|Following the 2011 release Rabbits on the Run, Carlton {{took time}} off to get married, start a family, and write another album. She tells CBS News that these changes in her life are {{reflected}} in Libermans songs, and that she [...] "wanted the whole album <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> escape type of album, where {{you put it on}} and you <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> youre in this dreamy state." ...|$|R
5|$|Rain World is a 2017 {{survival}} platformer {{video game}} in which the player controls a part-slug, part-cat creature searching a hostile, derelict world for its family. The Slugcat uses debris as weapons to escape randomized enemies, forage for food, and reach safe hibernation rooms before a deadly torrential rain arrives. The player is given little explicit guidance on how to survive, which was {{the intention of the}} developers, who wanted players <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rat living on subway tracks, in which they learn to survive in an environment without grasping its higher-level function. Rain World was developed by Videocult, a small indie team, over six years and published by Adult Swim Games for PlayStation 4 and Windows in March 2017. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its art design and fluid animations, but disliked its brutal difficulty and imprecise controls.|$|E

25|$|The {{sense of}} agency {{refers to the}} {{subjective}} feeling of having chosen a particular action. Some conditions, such as schizophrenia, {{can lead to a}} loss of this sense, causing a person <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> machine or even leading to delusions of being controlled from some outside source. The opposite extreme occurs too, with some people experiencing everything in their environment as if they had decided that it would happen.|$|E

5000|$|All {{three members}} of Bittereinder are from Afrikaans-speaking {{families}} in Pretoria but went to English-speaking schools. Due to the low status of Afrikaans in post-Apartheid South Africa, as a boy, Van der Merwe was made <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider growing up, and was [...] "called Dutchman and Boer daily." [...] The shame he felt as a result led to him rejecting the language and culture {{when he was growing}} up.|$|R
50|$|There were to {{have been}} three bespoke roller {{coasters}} on the site, intended to simulate the experience of driving an F1 car. The theme park area was designed <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> F1 paddock. Both of these factors were helped {{by the fact that}} several leading F1 teams were involved with the design and development of the park. 270 hours of productions were also planned to form a full schedule of entertainment within the park.|$|R
25|$|In 2011, Noten also {{designed}} a white Dior 001 gun {{and a black}} Chanel 001 gun with hand-tooled 18-karat gold details, {{as part of a}} larger series entitled 7 Necessities for a Woman (<b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> woman through the eyes of a man). The two 3D-printed nylon guns double as make-up bags with lip gloss and wand in the muzzle, the loading chamber serves as a pill compartment (complete with pills, including Viagra), 100grams of certified silver bullion in the Dior gun clip, 50grams of 24-karat gold in the Chanel, a toothpick and, in some models, a hairpin and a small vial of perfume. The guns also conceal a 4-gigabyte USB memory stick. Priced at US$11,500.00 (Dior gun) and over US$17,000.00 (Chanel gun) respectively.|$|E
500|$|Sony's {{acquisition}} of SCE Cambridge (which occurred {{within six months}} of Sony agreeing to publish the game) helped ease financial strain on the project, but did not assist the studio's inexperience with making 3D games. The takeover was also [...] "quite intimidating" [...] to Sorrell and Wilson, who had not held conferences. Sorrell stated the concept of conferences was [...] "totally alien". He felt that the game started <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> major project after a few meetings.|$|E
500|$|Conran {{summed up}} what {{influenced}} him in making Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow: [...] "We tried {{to approach it}} almost as though we lived in that era and were just another group of artists {{trying to make a}} work out of those pieces and inspirations. We wanted the film <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lost film of that era. If we're a footnote in the history of pulp art and Golden Age comics, that'd be enough, that'd be great. If we even just inspire some people to go back and investigate some of that stuff, we'd have done enough." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{years of}} fierce fighting, the Dark Lord was {{eventually}} sealed {{away by the}} hands of as hero named Rulzult. However, the damage had been done. All the demon blood spilled during the war caused the land to become cursed and the sky lost its light. This once serene paradise became known as [...] "the Cursed Land." [...] It entrapped its inhabitants and filled them with despair, causing each waking moment <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> eternity.|$|R
2500|$|An {{interview}} by ABC presenter Joe O'Brien with Lyle Shelton {{was the subject}} of a complaint by the Australian Christian Lobby. Bringing up Ian Thorpe's swimming achievements, O'Brien asked Shelton [...] "what right do you have to participate in that joy, and take national pride in those achievements, if you now deny him the right <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> equal and experience the joy of marriage?" [...] In rejecting any perceived bias, the ABC said [...] "It was a 'devil's advocate' question and not inconsistent with standards".|$|R
50|$|The {{recording}} of the album is very {{different than any other}} of Gloria's albums. As mentioned in the bonus feature in the Live & Unwrapped DVD, the album was recorded live which means the band played and Gloria sang at the same time. There is less reverb (echo) on Gloria's vocals, done to create an intimate feeling. The album is very acoustic and is designed <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> unplugged album. This is also the first Estefan album to not feature a brass section.|$|R
500|$|According to Ausmus, Hoffman {{wanted his}} teams <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> family. He {{felt like he}} let his family down {{if he did not}} do his job on a {{particular}} night. Still, he was accessible and held himself accountable on the rare occasions that he failed. Hoffman was more accommodating for interviews after blown saves than he was after successful ones. [...] "The people asking the questions are not responsible for the ball flying out of the park", he explained. Both Towers and Black best remember Hoffman for his accountability after his blown save in the 2007 Wild Card tie-breaker.|$|E
500|$|First-time {{director}} Conran incorporated many {{references to}} classic genre films {{into his own}} movie: [...] "The work of those artists and writers from the pulps and Golden Age of Comic Books like Airboy was really the template for us. To some extent we stole from it, to some extent we expanded on it [...] hopefully we added enough of our own sensibility. We tried to approach it almost as though we lived in that era and were just another group of artists {{trying to make a}} work [...] those pieces and inspirations. We wanted the film <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lost film of that era." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Lucy Lawless was {{revealed}} {{to be involved in}} the second season. At the San Diego Comic Con 2014, Lawless' role {{was revealed}} to be that of Isabelle Hartley, a longtime S.H.I.E.L.D. veteran. About the decision to cast Lawless as Hartley, who was always intended to be killed off at the end of the episode, Whedon said [...] "We wanted you to invest in the character and feel like this person was a real equal to Coulson. She definitely fit the bill on that front. Lucy has such a strength to her. We didn’t want people to know what was going to happen. We wanted it <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> big deal." ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} wide range {{discussion}} about whether Mini-publics undermine democracy by removing mass-representation. The {{chance of being}} selected for an assembly is very small. When people are called to vote, they are {{given the opportunity to}} interact with the government and with the law, which is interesting and engaging. Elections and voting are an important moment of exercising sovereignty, even if the vote makes little difference. Eliminating elections undermines the consultation process that allows everyone <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> involved citizen in a representative democracy.|$|R
25|$|GE {{was never}} {{extremely}} pleased that Lowe had quit {{them when the}} war began, and the position they offered him when he returned was not the position he thought he deserved. He was tired of traveling, and of being away from his family so much, and at GE he had begun <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> increasingly insignificant part of an increasingly large company. Jack was thirty-two {{years old when he}} came out of the Army, and within a few months he had founded a company he called Texas Distributors, Inc.|$|R
50|$|Another {{effect of}} Asian fetish {{is that it}} causes its targets <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> Other, because they are {{isolated}} and held to different standards of beauty. Asian American women report being complimented in ways that imply they are attractive because they are Asian or despite being Asian. Because of Asian fetish, an Asian woman’s racial difference is either seen as a failure to conform to mainstream white standards of beauty, or as {{something that can be}} appreciated only on an alternative scale. This can cause insecurity, and affect a woman’s self-worth and self-respect.|$|R
500|$|In {{his book}} subtitled The Beatles' Solo Years, 1970–1980, Robert Rodriguez {{features}} Extra Texture in a chapter {{dedicated to the}} worst solo albums released by the four ex-Beatles between 1970 and 1980 – {{the only one of}} Harrison's albums to be included there. Rodriguez writes: [...] "To be sure, Extra Texture boasted several fine cuts... but the remainder of the collection was almost entirely weary in tone, amounting to a prolonged buzz kill." [...] Nick DeRiso, co-founder of the music website Something Else!, includes it on his list of the five worst solo albums by either John Lennon, McCartney or Harrison, and describes it as a [...] "grinding, relentlessly downbeat album, where even the name Extra Texture has come <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cruel joke".|$|E
500|$|... "The Thing You Love Most" [...] is {{the first}} episode to feature Mary Margaret's loft, which is filmed on a small sound stage in Vancouver; most of the first season's {{interior}} shots are also filmed in the city, while many exterior shots are of nearby Steveston, British Columbia. The production team led by set decorator Mark Lane and production designer Michael Joy designed the residence to seem [...] "locked in time a little bit, so there's {{not a lot of}} new stuff." [...] They included working class antiques such as a Hoosier cabinet, an old gas stove, and a Bakelite radio. The loft was meant to be located above a store and near a lumber mill and water, so the crew also designed it <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fish cannery.|$|E
500|$|Fincher {{wanted the}} {{vignette}} to be a [...] "personal nightmare" [...] for Salander, replaying her darkest moments. [...] "Early on, {{we knew it}} was supposed <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> nightmare," [...] Miller professed, who commented that early on in the process, Fincher wanted to use an artwork as a template for the sequence. After browsing through various paintings to no avail, Fincher chose a painting that depicted the artist, covered in black paint, {{standing in the middle of}} a gallery. Many of Miller's sketches contained a liquid-like component, and were rewritten to produce the [...] "gooey" [...] element that was so desired. [...] "David said let's just put liquid in all of them and it will be this primordial dream ooze that's a part of every vignette," [...] Miller recalled. [...] "It ties everything together other than the black on black." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "1 Train" [...] {{is a song}} by American hip hop {{recording}} artist ASAP Rocky from his debut studio album, Long. Live. ASAP (2013). The song was produced by Hit-Boy, and features additional verses from fellow American rappers Kendrick Lamar, Joey Badass, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson and Big K.R.I.T. The song is a posse cut created <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> [...] "original '90s underground track." [...] Upon {{the release of the}} album, high downloads resulted in the song peaking at number three on the US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart.|$|R

5000|$|A {{month before}} he was to {{graduate}} from high school, Larry told his mother that he was heading to California to join his younger sister Diane who was deeply immersed in the 1960s counterculture (Diane had run away from home when she was 16). [...] In California Larry also took part in the scene and delved into drugs. Larry saw his sister Diane as a kindred spirit who understood what it was <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> outsider in society. On June 21, 1971, Diane was murdered. Larry accompanied her body back to their hometown for her funeral. The experience was emotionally devastating to him.|$|R
500|$|The full album {{versions}} continued, {{as well as}} a localized {{rendition of}} [...] "Wrecking Ball", at Springsteen's four shows to close out the Philadelphia Spectrum as well; some 43 different songs were playing during the stand. [...] Apart from the album playings, Springsteen kept setlists flexible during the third leg; sign requests continued, as in Springsteen's words they allowed [...] "the fans to have input into the show in a way that just pumps the blood into everything and enlivens the evening." [...] Born to Run remained the standard full album choice {{for the rest of the}} tour, but the two shows at New York's Madison Square Garden saw The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle and The River, with the latter's 20-song length dominating the setlist. [...] Springsteen felt The River show succeeded, saying [...] "I sequenced [...] <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> live show, so you have four fast songs and a couple of ballads. It played real well when we went to play it." ...|$|E
500|$|Messick {{said they}} {{designed}} [...] "a fairy tale, mythological fantasy world" [...] {{that feels like}} it happened long time ago but is not set in any particular time period. Marlene Stewart created the film's costumes, using traditional leather and linen but without an antique look. Its steampunk-like, retro-futuristic weapons were created by the weapon designer Simon Boucherie and Wirkola, who said they wanted Hansel and Gretel's weapons {{to look as if}} the characters hand-made them. Wirkola stated he [...] "just wanted this crazy, mashed-up world where you can’t pinpoint where it is, or when it is" [...] and the modern elements are there to [...] "add to the fun and tone of the film." [...] He said, [...] "We wanted the movie to feel timeless and for the movie <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fairy tale, but still grounded. It {{was a lot of fun}} coming up with the different weapon designs and ways of killing witches. We mixed old and new elements. But no matter how modern some of the weapons are, they all have an old-fashioned feel and look like they could fit into this world." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{squadron}} armourers {{and mechanics}} repaired the faulty machine-gun synchroniser on {{his most recent}} S.E.5 mount, A8898, Ball had been sporadically flying the Nieuport again, and was successful with it on 6 May, destroying one more Albatros D.III in an evening flight to raise his tally to 44. He had continued to undertake his habitual lone patrols, but had of late been fortunate to survive. The heavier battle damage that Ball's aircraft were now suffering bore witness to the improved team tactics being developed by his German opponents. Some time on 6 May, Ball had visited his friend Billy Bishop at the latter's aerodrome. He proposed that the pair attack the Red Baron's squadron at its airfield at dawn, catching the German pilots off guard. Bishop agreed {{to take part in}} the daring scheme at the end of the month, after he returned from his forthcoming leave. That night, in his last letter to his father, Ball wrote [...] "I do get tired of always living to kill, and am really beginning <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> murderer. Shall be so pleased when I have finished".|$|E
60|$|I {{was glad}} to get back home, of course; but it did seem queer and lonesome. The cats hardly knew me, and William Adolphus roamed about forlornly and {{appeared}} <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> exile. I didn't take as much pleasure in cooking as usual, for it seemed kind of foolish to be fussing over oneself. The sight of a bone {{made me think of}} poor Mr. Riley. The neighbours avoided me pointedly, for they couldn't get rid of the fear that I might erupt into smallpox at any moment. My Sunday School class had been given to another woman, and altogether I felt as if I didn't belong anywhere.|$|R
