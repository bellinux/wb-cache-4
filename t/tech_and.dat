5|$|In 1946, Boyd {{returned}} to Georgia Tech's physics department and its Engineering Experiment Station, {{where he worked}} as Assistant Project Director under Frank Lawrence (and, after Lawrence's departure, as Project Director) on an Army Air Corps-sponsored project studying microwave propagation. As part of the project, he conducted long-range line-of-sight experiments between Georgia <b>Tech</b> <b>and</b> Mount Oglethorpe in North Georgia. In 1947, Boyd co-authored a study entitled Propagation Studies of Electromagnetic Waves, {{which resulted in a}} series of related research contracts, including a large one obtained from the Navy Bureau of Ordnance on radar-directed fire control. Boyd was promoted to professor of physics in 1948. Around 1950, under the authority of his rank of commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve, Boyd created a U.S. Navy Research Reserve Unit at Georgia Tech that included officers from both Georgia <b>Tech</b> <b>and</b> the Atlanta metropolitan area. In the 1950s, Boyd was promoted to captain and ran this unit until his departure from Georgia Tech.|$|E

40|$|This note {{describes}} how {{to determine the}} number of classes in latent class analysis using Mplus. The Lo-Mendell-Rubin test and the bootstrapped likelihood test using <b>TECH</b> 11 <b>and</b> <b>TECH</b> 14 are considered. The note describes the K- 1 STARTS and LRTSTARTS options that are used with <b>TECH</b> 11 <b>and</b> <b>TECH</b> 14. It is pointed out that K- 1 STARTS makes it unnecessary to arrange the classes so that the last class is the largest. It is shown how to use LRTSTARTS to avoid warnings about loglikelihoods not being replicated in the bootstrap draws. The advantage of using OPTSEED is discussed. It is demonstrated how to do the analysis stepwise and how to avoid local optima. Following these steps can also reduce computational time and avoid ineffective analysis attempts. It is shown that the common mistake of using STARTS together with <b>TECH</b> 11 <b>and</b> <b>TECH</b> 14 leads to significantly longer computational time than using the proposed steps. 2...|$|R
