5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar. If <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause the front wheel to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> mass and the elevation of <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E

40|$|Static force {{procedures}} of most building codes {{require that the}} lateral earthquake force at each floor level of an asymmetric-plan building be applied eccentrically from <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> rigidity.

This paper presents a new approach for code lateral force analysis of asymmetric-plan buildings without locating <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> rigidity. This procedure combines the results from three static analyses, which can be implemented directly on most commercially available computer programs for analysis of multistory buidings. The work presented in this paper should dispel the long-held view that locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> rigidity must be determined to implement the code procedure, thereby removing one of the major difficulties in building analysis...|$|R
