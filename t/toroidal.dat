5|$|An 11-year {{sunspot cycle}} is {{half of a}} 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo cycle, which {{corresponds}} to an oscillatory exchange of energy between <b>toroidal</b> and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal <b>toroidal</b> quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At {{this point in the}} dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of <b>toroidal</b> magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.|$|E
5|$|During {{the solar}} cycle's declining phase, energy shifts from the {{internal}} <b>toroidal</b> magnetic {{field to the}} external poloidal field, and sunspots diminish in number and size. At solar-cycle minimum, the <b>toroidal</b> field is, correspondingly, at minimum strength, sunspots are relatively rare, and the poloidal field is at its maximum strength. With {{the rise of the}} next 11-year sunspot cycle, differential rotation shifts magnetic energy back from the poloidal to the <b>toroidal</b> field, but with a polarity that is opposite to the previous cycle. The process carries on continuously, and in an idealized, simplified scenario, each 11-year sunspot cycle corresponds to a change, then, in the overall polarity of the Sun's large-scale magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Toroids : The fossil Vendoglossa tuberculata {{from the}} Nama Group, Namibia, has been {{interpreted}} as a dorso-ventrally compressed stem-group metazoan, with a large gut cavity and a transversely ridged ectoderm. The organism is {{in the shape of}} a flattened torus, with the long axis of its <b>toroidal</b> body running through the approximate center of the presumed gut cavity.|$|E
5|$|From 1953 to 1957 Kerst was {{technical}} {{director of the}} Midwestern Universities Research Association, where he worked on advanced particle accelerator concepts, most notably the FFAG accelerator. He was then employed at General Atomics's John Jay Hopkins Laboratory from 1957 to 1962, where {{he worked on the}} problem of plasma physics. With Tihiro Ohkawa he invented <b>toroidal</b> devices for containing the plasma with magnetic fields. Their devices were the first to contain plasma without the instabilities that had plagued previous designs, and the first to contain plasma for lifetimes exceeding the Bohm diffusion limit.|$|E
5|$|On the average, {{space is}} {{observed}} {{to be very}} nearly flat (close to zero curvature), meaning that Euclidean geometry is empirically true with high accuracy {{throughout most of the}} Universe. Spacetime also appears to have a simply connected topology, in analogy with a sphere, at least on the length-scale of the observable Universe. However, present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the Universe has more dimensions and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the cylindrical or <b>toroidal</b> topologies of two-dimensional spaces.|$|E
5|$|Third, the {{curvature}} index k determines {{the sign of}} the mean spatial curvature of spacetime averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion light years). If k=1, {{the curvature}} is positive and the Universe has a finite volume. Such universes are often visualized as a three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if k is zero or negative, the Universe has infinite volume. It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when R=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when k does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both. A <b>toroidal</b> Universe could behave like a normal Universe with periodic boundary conditions.|$|E
25|$|A <b>toroidal</b> graph is a graph {{that can}} be {{embedded}} without crossings on the torus. More generally, the genus of a graph is the minimum genus of a two-dimensional surface into which the graph may be embedded; planar graphs have genus zero and nonplanar <b>toroidal</b> graphs have genus one.|$|E
25|$|Real-world {{examples}} of <b>toroidal</b> objects include inner tubes, rings, doughnuts, and bagels.|$|E
25|$|Although the Robertson–Seymour theorem extends {{these results}} to {{arbitrary}} minor-closed graph families, {{it is not}} a complete substitute for these results, because it does not provide an explicit description of the obstruction set for any family. For example, it tells us that the set of <b>toroidal</b> graphs has a finite obstruction set, but it does not provide any such set. The complete set of forbidden minors for <b>toroidal</b> graphs remains unknown, but contains at least 16000 graphs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Toroidal</b> groups play an {{important}} part in the theory of compact Lie groups. This {{is due in part to}} the fact that in any compact Lie group G one can always find a maximal torus; that is, a closed subgroup which is a torus of the largest possible dimension. Such maximal tori T have a controlling role to play in theory of connected G. <b>Toroidal</b> groups are examples of protori, which (like tori) are compact connected abelian groups, which are not required to be manifolds.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{the notion}} of orientability of a {{polyhedron}} is insufficient to characterise the surface twistings of <b>toroidal</b> polytopes, and {{this led to the}} use of torsion coefficients.|$|E
25|$|Magnetic Loops Another {{example of}} {{magnetic}} confinement is {{to bend the}} field lines back on themselves, either in circles or more commonly in nested <b>toroidal</b> surfaces. The most highly developed system of this type is the tokamak, with the stellarator being next most advanced, followed by the Reversed field pinch. Compact toroids, especially the Field-Reversed Configuration and the spheromak, attempt to combine the advantages of <b>toroidal</b> magnetic surfaces with those of a simply connected (non-toroidal) machine, resulting in a mechanically simpler and smaller confinement area.|$|E
25|$|Projective polyhedra {{all have}} Euler {{characteristic}} 1, {{like the real}} projective plane, while the surfaces of <b>toroidal</b> polyhedra all have Euler characteristic 0, like the torus.|$|E
25|$|If a {{circular}} embedding exists, {{it might not}} be on a surface of minimal genus: Nguyen Huy Xuong described a biconnected <b>toroidal</b> graph none of whose circular embeddings lie on a torus.|$|E
25|$|The {{cyclical}} dextrins {{are known}} as cyclodextrins. They are formed by enzymatic degradation of starch by certain bacteria, for example, Paenibacillus macerans (Bacillus macerans). Cyclodextrins have <b>toroidal</b> structures formed by 6-8 glucose residues.|$|E
25|$|A <b>toroidal</b> {{ion trap}} can be visualized as a linear {{quadrupole}} curved around and connected {{at the ends}} or as {{a cross section of}} a 3D ion trap rotated on edge to form the toroid, donut shaped trap. The trap can store large volumes of ions by distributing them throughout the ring-like trap structure. This <b>toroidal</b> shaped trap is a configuration that allows the increased miniaturization of an ion trap mass analyzer. Additionally all ions are stored in the same trapping field and ejected together simplifying detection that can be complicated with array configurations due to variations in detector alignment and machining of the arrays.|$|E
25|$|The airspheres {{resemble}} in {{some respects}} the orbit-sized ring of breathable atmosphere created by Larry Niven in The Integral Trees, but spherical not <b>toroidal,</b> require a force field to retain their integrity, and arose by artificial rather than natural processes.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} <b>toroidal</b> trap, linear traps and 3D {{quadrupole}} ion traps {{are the most}} commonly miniaturized mass analyzers due to their high sensitivity, tolerance for mTorr pressure, and capabilities for single analyzer tandem mass spectrometry (e.g. product ion scans).|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Gonzalo Vélez Jahn (UCV, Caracas, Venezuela) {{discovered}} three dimensional {{bodies with}} Möbian characteristics; these were later described by Martin Gardner as prismatic rings that became <b>toroidal</b> polyhedrons in his August 1978 Mathematical Games column in Scientific American.|$|E
25|$|The Heawood graph is a <b>toroidal</b> graph; that is, {{it can be}} {{embedded}} without crossings onto a torus. One embedding of {{this type}} places its vertices and edges into three-dimensional Euclidean space as the set of vertices and edges of a nonconvex polyhedron with the topology of a torus, the Szilassi polyhedron.|$|E
25|$|For example, the torus has Euler {{characteristic}} χ = 0 (and genus g = 1) {{and thus}} p = 7, so {{no more than}} 7 colors are required to color any map on a torus. This upper bound of 7 is sharp: certain <b>toroidal</b> polyhedra such as the Szilassi polyhedron require seven colors.|$|E
25|$|Three years later, in 1968, the {{international}} meeting {{was being held}} in Novosibirsk where Soviet results with the T-3 tokamak were first released. This overshadowed a paper by Robinson and King that had examined the quiescence period and determined {{it was due to}} the original <b>toroidal</b> magnetic field reversing itself, creating a more stable configuration.|$|E
25|$|Bumpy torus: A {{number of}} {{magnetic}} mirrors are arranged end-to-end in a <b>toroidal</b> ring. Any fuel ions that leak {{out of one}} are confined in a neighboring mirror, permitting the plasma pressure to be raised arbitrarily high without loss. An experimental facility, the ELMO Bumpy Torus or EBT was built and tested at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{universe}} could be finite, even if its curvature is flat. An {{easy way to}} understand this is to consider two-dimensional examples, such as video games where items that leave one edge of the screen reappear on the other. The topology of such games is <b>toroidal</b> and the geometry is flat. Many possible bounded, flat possibilities also exist for three-dimensional space.|$|E
25|$|Workable {{designs for}} a <b>toroidal</b> reactor that {{theoretically}} will deliver {{ten times more}} fusion energy than the amount needed to heat plasma to the required temperatures are in development (see ITER). The ITER facility is expected to finish its construction phase in 2019. It will start commissioning the reactor that same year and initiate plasma experiments in 2020, but {{is not expected to}} begin full deuterium-tritium fusion until 2027.|$|E
25|$|Solar Wind At Pluto (SWAP) is a <b>toroidal</b> {{electrostatic}} analyzer and retarding potential analyzer (RPA), {{that makes up}} one of the two instruments comprising New Horizons Plasma and high-energy particle spectrometer suite (PAM), the other being PEPSSI. SWAP measures particles of up to 6.5keV and, because of the tenuous solar wind at Pluto's distance, the instrument is designed with the largest aperture of any such instrument ever flown.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} speed, U, {{is that in}} {{the exit}} plane, and the characteristic dimension L is the nozzle width, to which the cell dimensions are proportional. Circular supersonic jets also generate screech tones. In this case, however, there can be three modes of motion: symmetric (<b>toroidal),</b> asymmetric (sinuous), and helical. These whistles are unlike the others listed above; the sound is generated without interaction with a solid; it is truly an aerodynamic whistle.|$|E
25|$|Thonemann had {{returned}} {{by this point}} and found much to disagree with on ICSE. He demanded {{to be allowed to}} set up a new fusion group to remain at Harwell on ZETA. ZETA remained the largest <b>toroidal</b> machine in the world for some time, and went on to have a productive career for just over a decade, but in spite of its later successes ZETA was always known as an example of British folly.|$|E
25|$|ATLAS (A <b>Toroidal</b> LHC ApparatuS) {{is one of}} {{the seven}} {{particle}} detector experiments (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, TOTEM, LHCb, LHCf and MoEDAL) constructed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland. The experiment is designed {{to take advantage of the}} unprecedented energy available at the LHC and observe phenomena that involve highly massive particles which were not observable using earlier lower-energy accelerators. It is hoped that it will shed light on new theories of particle physics beyond the Standard Model.|$|E
25|$|An {{annular duct}} carries the fluid {{that creates the}} annular jet. The jet impinges on a sharp ended ring with two <b>toroidal</b> {{cavities}} on either side. In Levavasseur's patent, a structure is added downstream of the annular opening {{to act as a}} coupling horn to direct the sound. The sound generated is very intense. It appears that no scientific study has been done to elucidate the detailed feedback mechanisms of its operation, although it is clear that this whistle has Class I feedback mechanism, similar to the police whistle.|$|E
25|$|If it {{is desired}} to save memory, the storage {{can be reduced}} to one array plus 3 line buffers. One line buffer is used to {{calculate}} the successor state for a line, then the second line buffer is used to calculate the successor state for the next line. The first buffer is then written to its line and freed to hold the successor state for the third line. If a <b>toroidal</b> array is used, a third buffer is needed so that the original state of the first line in the array can be saved until the last line is computed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>toroidal</b> pinch {{concept as}} a route to fusion was {{explored}} in the UK during the mid-1940s, especially by George Paget Thomson of Imperial College London. With {{the formation of}} the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell in 1945, Thomson repeatedly petitioned the director, John Cockcroft, for funds to develop an experimental machine. These requests were turned down. At the time there was no obvious military use, so the concept was left unclassified. This allowed Thomson and Moses Blackman to patent the idea in 1947, describing a device using just enough pinch current to ionise and briefly confine the plasma while being heated by a microwave source that would also continually drive the current.|$|E
25|$|Froning and Roach (2002) {{put forward}} a paper that builds {{on the work of}} Puthoff, Haisch and Alcubierre. They used fluid dynamic {{simulations}} to model the interaction of a vehicle (like that proposed by Alcubierre) with the zero-point field. Vacuum field perturbations are simulated by fluid field perturbations and the aerodynamic resistance of viscous drag exerted on the interior of the vehicle is compared to the Lorentz force exerted by the zero-point field (a Casimir-like force is exerted on the exterior by unbalanced zero-point radiation pressures). They find that the optimized negative energy required for an Alcubierre drive is where it is a saucer-shaped vehicle with <b>toroidal</b> electromagnetic fields. The EM fields distort the vacuum field perturbations surrounding the craft sufficiently to affect the permeability and permittivity of space.|$|E
25|$|In principle, the Life {{field is}} infinite, but {{computers}} have finite memory. This leads to problems when the active area encroaches {{on the border}} of the array. Programmers have used several strategies to address these problems. The simplest strategy is simply to assume that every cell outside the array is dead. This is easy to program, but leads to inaccurate results when the active area crosses the boundary. A more sophisticated trick is to consider the left and right edges of the field to be stitched together, and the top and bottom edges also, yielding a <b>toroidal</b> array. The result is that active areas that move across a field edge reappear at the opposite edge. Inaccuracy can still result if the pattern grows too large, but at least there are no pathological edge effects. Techniques of dynamic storage allocation may also be used, creating ever-larger arrays to hold growing patterns.|$|E
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1884, Károly Zipernowsky, Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri (ZBD), three {{engineers}} associated with the Ganz factory, determined that open-core devices were impractical, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage. In their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called ZBD transformers), they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either a wound around iron wire ring core or b)surrounded by iron wire core. In both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely {{within the confines of}} the iron core, with no intentional path through air (see <b>toroidal</b> cores). The new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs. The Ganz factory in 1884 shipped the world's first five high-efficiency AC transformers. This first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications: 1,400 W, 40Hz, 120:72 V, 11.6:19.4 A, ratio 1.67:1, one-phase, shell form.|$|E
25|$|Algebraic {{geometry}} and cryptography likewise uses group theory in many ways. Abelian varieties {{have been introduced}} above. The presence of the group operation yields additional information which makes these varieties particularly accessible. They also often serve as a test for new conjectures. The one-dimensional case, namely elliptic curves is studied in particular detail. They are both theoretically and practically intriguing. Very large groups of prime order constructed in elliptic curve cryptography serve for public-key cryptography. Cryptographical methods of this kind benefit from {{the flexibility of the}} geometric objects, hence their group structures, together with the complicated structure of these groups, which make the discrete logarithm very hard to calculate. One of the earliest encryption protocols, Caesar's cipher, may also be interpreted as a (very easy) group operation. In another direction, toric varieties are algebraic varieties acted on by a torus. <b>Toroidal</b> embeddings have recently led to advances in algebraic geometry, in particular resolution of singularities.|$|E
