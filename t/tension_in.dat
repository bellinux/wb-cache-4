5|$|For Reich, {{character}} {{structure was}} the result of social processes, in particular a reflection of castration and Oedipal anxieties playing themselves out within the nuclear family. Les Greenberg and Jeremy Safran write that Reich proposed a functional identity between the character, emotional blocks, and <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the body, or what he called character (or muscular/body) armour (Charakterpanzer).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{systematic}} {{framework for the}} analysis of <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> corporate sustainability. The framework is based on the emerging integrative view on corporate sustainability, which stresses the need for a simultaneous integration of economic, environmental and social dimensions without, a priori, emphasising one over any other. The integrative view presupposes that firms need to accept <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> corporate sustainability and pursue different sustainability aspects simultaneously even if they seem to contradict each other. The framework proposed in this paper goes beyond the traditional triad of economic, environmental and social dimensions and argues that <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> corporate sustainability occur between different levels, in change processes and within a temporal and spatial context. The framework provides vital groundwork for managing <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> corporate sustainability based on paradox strategies. The paper then applies the framework to identify and characterise four selected tensions and illustrates how key approaches from the literature on strategic contradictions, tensions and paradoxes-i. e., acceptance and resolution strategies-can be used to manage these tensions. Thereby, it refines the emerging literature on the integrative view for the management of <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> corporate sustainability. The framework also provides managers with a better understanding of <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> corporate sustainability and enables them to embrace these <b>tensions</b> <b>in</b> their decision making...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> late-December, the {{standoff}} remained. The US hoped the generals would relent because they could not survive and be able to repel the communists or rival officers without aid from Washington. On the other hand, Khánh and the Young Turks expected the Americans would become more worried about the communist gains first and acquiesce to their fait accompli against the HNC. The generals were correct.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} British cities, there was {{immigration}} from various Commonwealth {{countries in the}} post war years, which did lead to some racist <b>tension.</b> <b>In</b> 1963, a colour bar operated by Bristol Omnibus Company, which at that time refused to employ Black or Asian bus crews, was successfully challenged in the Bristol Bus Boycott, which was considered to have been instrumental in the eventual passage of the Race Relations Act 1968. In 1980 a police raid on a cafe in St Paul's sparked the St Pauls riot, which highlighted the alienation of the city's ethnic minorities.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the Nazi–Soviet pact on 23 August 1939, the RAF mobilised. Cunningham had been test-flying the airliner de Havilland Dragon. Only 16 were complete before the declaration of war in September. The growing <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> Europe made war more likely. John was forced to commit himself either to de Havilland or the RAF at this juncture. The RAF had trained him and he felt he could be of far more use in the RAF than test-flying aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In the 1870s and 1880s {{there was}} {{considerable}} <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the region—between the rural residents, who were {{for the most part}} Democrats from the agricultural South, and town residents and business owners, who were largely Republicans from the industrial Northeast and Midwest. The tension culminated in what has been called the Cochise County feud, and the Earp-Clanton feud, which ended with the historic Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Ride.|$|E

In addition to increased urban population, these European immigrants had a cultural effect upon Argentina, providing what Sarmiento believed to be more civilized culture similar to North America's.|$|E

Chikao Ōtsuka, who voiced Eggman, found him a difficult character to play due to the <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> his voice and Ōtsuka's desire to have children who watched the show recognize the character as a villain but not hate him.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tension</b> <b>in</b> the Golan Heights area {{remained}} {{high and}} on 9January the Jewish settlements of Dan and Kfar Szold {{were attacked by}} Arab irregulars from the Arab Liberation Army, who crossed the border from Syria. The division responded by immediately sending a troop of armoured cars from the 17th/21st Lancers to each village. By the afternoon the 1st Parachute Battalion had joined the battle and air support from the Royal Air Force was called in. The battle ended with the Arabs withdrawing; their casualties are not known. Nine Jews were killed or wounded by the Arabs, the British troops uninjured.|$|E

5|$|The {{cohesive}} forces among liquid molecules {{are responsible}} for the phenomenon of surface <b>tension.</b> <b>In</b> the bulk of the liquid, each molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring liquid molecules, resulting in a net force of zero. The molecules at the surface {{do not have the same}} molecules on all sides of them and therefore are pulled inwards. This creates some internal pressure and forces liquid surfaces to contract to the minimal area.|$|E
5|$|The overweighting of the {{stressed}} syllables {{strengthens the}} humour of the lines.

They create <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the Sourdough chapter from Adventures of a Bachelor, through the alternation of trochees and dactyls.

5|$|After a {{successful}} (8–1–1) football season in 1955, Tech {{was invited to}} play in the 1956 Sugar Bowl in New Orleans against the University of Pittsburgh. It would be the school's fifth straight bowl appearance under renowned coach Bobby Dodd. Pittsburgh had a black starting player, fullback Bobby Grier, but as Tech had played a 1953 game against a desegregated Notre Dame team, and the University of Georgia had very recently played out-of-state games against desegregated opponents, president Van Leer and the Tech Athletic Association saw the game's contract as acceptable. However, racial <b>tension</b> <b>in</b> the South was high following the recent Brown v. Board of Education decision. Georgia Governor Marvin Griffin had privately given Dodd his support, but he surprised the campus and the state on Friday, December 2, 1955 by bowing to pressure from segregationists and sending a wire to the Georgia Board of Regents chairman, Robert O. Arnold, requesting not only that Tech not play the game, but that all University System of Georgia teams play only segregated games.|$|E
