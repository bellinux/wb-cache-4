40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: A new {{approach}} to both 3 -dimensional (3 D) trueness and precision is necessary to assess the accuracy of intraoral digital impressions and compare them to conventionally acquired impressions. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate whether a new reference scanner is capable of measuring conventional and digital intraoral complete-arch impressions for 3 D accuracy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A steel reference dentate model was fabricated and measured with a reference scanner (digital reference model). Conventional impressions were made from the reference model, poured with Type IV dental stone, scanned with the reference scanner, and exported as digital models. Additionally, digital impressions of the reference model were made and the digital models were exported. Precision was measured by superimposing the digital models within each group. Superimposing the digital models on the digital reference model assessed the <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> each impression method. Statistical significance was assessed with an independent sample t test (α=. 05). RESULTS: The reference scanner delivered high accuracy over the entire dental arch with a precision of 1. 6 ± 0. 6 µm and a <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> 5. 3 ± 1. 1 µm. Conventional impressions showed significantly higher precision (12. 5 ± 2. 5 µm) and trueness values (20. 4 ± 2. 2 µm) with small deviations in the second molar region (P<. 001). Digital impressions were significantly less accurate with a precision of 32. 4 ± 9. 6 µm and a <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> 58. 6 ± 15. 8 µm (P<. 001). More systematic deviations of the digital models were visible across the entire dental arch. CONCLUSIONS: The new reference scanner is capable of measuring the precision and <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> both digital and conventional complete-arch impressions.

40|$|The digital {{intraoral}} {{impression is}} a central part in today's CAD/CAM dentistry. With its possibilities, new treatment options for the patient is provided and the prosthetic workflow is accelerated. Nowadays, the major issue with intraoral scanning systems is to gain more accuracy especially for larger scan areas and to simplify clinical handling for the dentist. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate different scanning strategies regardingtheir accuracy with full arch scans in an in-vitro study design. A reference master model was used for the digital impressions with the Lava COS, the Cerec Bluecam and a powderfree intraoral scanning system, Cadent iTero. The <b>trueness</b> and precision <b>of</b> each scanning protocol was measured. Lava COS provides the a <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> 45. 8 microm with the scanning protocol recommended from the manufacturer. A different scanning protocol shows significantly lower accuracy (trueness +/- 90. 2 microm). Cerec Bluecam also benefits from an optimal scanning protocol with a <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> +/- 23. 3 microm compared to +/- 52. 5 microm with a standard protocol. The powderfree impression system Cadent iTero shows also a high accurate full-arch scan with a <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> +/- 35. 0 microm and a precision of +/- 30. 9 microm.

The objective {{of the present study was}} to compare the accuracy (<b>trueness</b> and precision) <b>of</b> digital impressions of the full arch with that of conventional impressions on the in-vitro model. For this purpose, a master model was acquired with a new reference scanning process, the measuring <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> which was +/- 4. 1 microm and the precision +/- 2. 5 microm. On the one hand, conventional impressions and then plaster models (n = 5) were produced from this master model, and on the other hand, digital impressions were made with the Cerec AC Bluecam and the Lava COS system (each n = 5). The plaster models were also scanned with the reference scanner. The available data records were superimposed and the differences determined. The deviation from the master model defines the <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> the impression method. The deviations of the models among one another demonstrate the precision of the method. The <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> the impressions was 55 +/- 21. 8 microm in the conventional impression group, for digital impressions with Cerec Bluecam it was 49 +/- 14. 2 microm and for digital impressions with Lava COS 40. 3 +/- 14. 1 microm. The precision was 61. 3 +/- 17. 9 microm for conventional impression with Impregum, 30. 9 +/- 7. 1 microm for digital impression with the Cerec Bluecam and 60. 1 +/- 31. 3 microm for digital impression with Lava COS.

A recommendation {{issued by the}} European Commission emphasizes the need of generating data on the occurrence of these substances in {{a broad range of}} different foods. So far, analytical methods for the determination of MCPDEs and GEs are fully validated only for oils, fats and margarine. This manuscript presents the assessment of critical steps in the AOCS Cd 29 a- 13 method for the simultaneous determination of MCPDEs and GEs in the fat phase obtained from bakery and potato products, smoked and fried fish and meat, and other cereal products. The <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> the method is affected by the additional formation of 3 -MBPD esters from monoacylglycerols (MAGs), which are frequently present in food. The overestimation of GE contents for some samples was confirmed by the comparison of results with results obtained by an independent analytical method (direct analysis of GE by HPLC-MS/MS). An additional sample pre-treatment by SPE was introduced to remove MAGs from fat prior to the GEs conversion, while the overall method sensitivity was not significantly affected. <b>Trueness</b> <b>of</b> the determination of GEs by the modified analytical procedure was confirmed by comparison with a direct analysis of GEs.

40|$|Breast-conserving {{surgery is}} a {{standard}} option {{for the treatment of}} patients with early-stage breast cancer. This form of surgery may result in incomplete excision of the tumor. Iodine- 125 labeled titanium seeds are currently used in clinical practice {{to reduce the number of}} incomplete excisions. It seems likely that the number of incomplete excisions can be reduced even further if intraoperative information about the location of the radioactive seed is combined with preoperative information about the extent of the tumor. This can be combined if the location of the radioactive seed is established in a world coordinate system that can be linked to the (preoperative) image coordinate system. With this in mind, we propose a radioactive seed localization system which is composed of two static ceiling-suspended gamma camera heads and two parallel-hole collimators. Physical experiments and computer simulations which mimic realistic clinical situations were performed to estimate the localization accuracy (defined as <b>trueness</b> and precision) <b>of</b> the proposed system with respect to collimator-source distance (ranging between 50 cm and 100 cm) and imaging time (ranging between 1 s and 10 s).

Elements additional to the DWD, i. e. those evaluated by the WHO and those mentioned in national regulations concerning the acceptance of products that come in contact with drinking water, were included in our study. Analysis of the certified standard revealed that K, Pb and Se might only suffer from a small systematic error whereas As and Ca might suffer a bigger systematic error (P= 0. 05). The <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> As is out of range compared to what is defined in the DWD. The <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> Cu and Pb is at the edge. The precision of As and Se are on the edge. In general, the low concentrations in the samples compared to the parametric values in the DWD result in slightly or significantly lower precisions. The precision of Al, Ca, Fe, Mg and Zn for the samples is lower compared to that of the certified standard at a similar concentration level whereas U showed the opposite behaviour. The certified values and their precision for certified standards are normally obtained by single element analysis and do not consider performance during time. Considering the fact that our method analyses 28 elements and that this might introduce additional variations both in trueness and precision compared to single element analysis and the fact that the results were obtained during ten month, our method is fit for our purpose to study release from materials.
