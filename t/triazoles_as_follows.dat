Therefore, searching for new aglycosidase inhibitors (GIs) capable of slowing down carbohydrate assimilation by humans is an important strategy towards control of NIDDM. In this report, we disclose the search for new easily accessible synthetic <b>triazoles</b> <b>as</b> anti-diabetic compounds. Two series of non-glycosid triazoles were synthesized (series A and B) and screened against baker’s yeast a-glucosidase (MAL 12) and porcine pancreatic a-amylase activity (PPA). Of the 60 compounds tested at 500 mM, were considered hits (60 % inhibition) six triazoles against MAL 12 and three against PPA, with the inhibition reaching up to 99. 4 % on MAL 12 and 88. 6 % on PPA. The IC 50 values were calculated for both enzymes and ranged from 54 to 482 mM for MAL 12 and 145 to 282 mM for PPA.

Moreover, different functional groups can be introduced at each step, which amplifies the use of this strategy for many potential applications.

Improvement such as chemical modification of chitosan is often performed prior to further utilization.

Their antifungal activity against three kinds of phytopathogens was estimated by hyphal measurement in vitro. The inhibitory property and water solubility of the synthesized chitosan derivatives exhibited a remarkable improvement over chitosan. It is hypothesized that thiazolyl groups enable the synthesized chitosan to possess obviously better antifungal activity. Moreover, CTCTS and BTCTS, which have halogens at the periphery of polymers, inhibited the growth of tested phytopathogens more effectively with inhibitory indices of 81 - 93 % at 1. 0 mg/mL. The halogens could have a synergistic effect with <b>triazole</b> <b>as</b> they exhibited antifungal activity and electron-withdrawing capacity, which improve the antifungal activity of chitosan derivatives.

40|$|Strobilurins {{have made}} {{a major impact on}} wheat {{production}} in the UK since their introduction in 1997. In addition to broad-spectrum protectant fungicidal activity, there have been striking effects on green canopy retention and reports of direct physiological effects on crops. In experiments with very low incidence of disease, yields from azoxystrobin were greater than from epoxiconazole or kresoxim-methyl plus epoxiconazole. The mechanism responsible for the yield increases could not be found in differences in green canopy amount or retention. There was some evidence that strobilurin treatment resulted in higher chlorophyll concentration in older green leaves, which may allow increased light absorption. Because strobilurins have little, if any, eradicant activity, mixture with a triazole is needed to ensure optimum disease control and yield.

40|$|Calonectria pseudonaviculata, {{the causal}} {{agent of the}} disease of Buxus spp. known as 'box blight', was first {{detected}} in the mid- 1990 s in the UK and New Zealand. Since then, the geographic range of box blight has rapidly expanded to at least 21 countries throughout temperate regions of the world, causing significant losses in nurseries, gardens and wild boxwood populations. This study determined the genetic diversity {{in a collection of}} 234 Calonectria isolates from diseased Buxus plants, originating from 15 countries and four continents. Two genetic clades, G 1 and G 2, were identified within this sample using multilocus phylogenetic analysis. The application of genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition criteria using four independent nuclear loci determined that the Calonectria isolates in these two clades are separate phylogenetic species. The isolates in the G 1 clade were upheld as C. pseudonaviculata sensu stricto. Based on phylogenetic distinctiveness and the lack of mating, a new species is proposed, Calonectria henricotiae sp. nov., for the Calonectria isolates in the G 2 clade. A PCR-RFLP assay and real-time PCR assays were developed to easily and reproducibly differentiate these species. To assess the practical implications of the identification of the two species, their physiology, fungicide susceptibility and pathogenicity were compared.
