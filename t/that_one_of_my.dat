25|$|Lodge: Well, {{you are a}} {{chief of}} state. I cannot give you advice, but personally, and as a friend, and as {{somebody}} who is concerned about your health, my suggestion would be you think seriously of getting away. Now, if I can be of any help on that, I'm prepared to send my driver with an officer of mine to escort you to safety. And we can get you on my jet aircraft, and I'm sure I can deliver on <b>that.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> officers will ride {{in the front seat}} of my limousine with the chauffeur.|$|E
500|$|A direct {{relationship}} between the real Clyde and the fictional Winesburg, however, remains the supposition of scholars. Anderson wrote in A Writer's Conception of Realism that he reacted with [...] "shock" [...] when he [...] "...heard people say <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own books Winesburg, Ohio, was an exact picture of Ohio village life." [...] The author went on to admit that, [...] "the hint for almost every character was taken from my fellow lodgers in a large rooming house..." [...] These lodgers were the [...] "...young musicians, young writers, painters, actors..." [...] and others that lived in proximity to Anderson on the North Side of Chicago and to whom he referred as [...] "The Little Children of the Arts". The truth probably lies somewhere in between, with memories of Clyde [...] "merging" [...] with Anderson's interactions at the boardinghouse.|$|E
500|$|On New Years Day 2012, a {{low quality}} snippet of [...] "Lovebird" [...] leaked {{under the title}} [...] "Love Birds". After the song leaked, Lewis {{expressed}} her frustration at the song being available for listening to on the Internet, stating: [...] "I'm sad <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> songs leaked. As an artist that holds music dear to my heart I would've liked {{to share it with}} u [...] when it's ready. I hope that you feel it like I do and when it's time to be released you'll still support it in the right way. Thank u [...] for the love." [...] That same month, it was announced that the album was expected to be released on 26 March 2012. Record executive Simon Cowell later publicly give his support for Glassheart, saying to Lewis that, although there had been a lengthy wait of two years for new music, the album was [...] "sensational", and that Lewis had [...] "never sounded better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not at all,' he replied. 'If I {{were going}} from Manchester to Liverpool, I should break the journey in London. <b>That's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hobbies.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Maria kept it together. [...] "I owe her thanks. Whatever her temptation she didn't {{separate}} us. <b>That's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> reasons," [...] {{she went}} on [...] "for admiring her so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No offense, young fellah. I'm goin' {{to get a}} young devil chick for Challenger. <b>That's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> jobs. No, I don't {{want your}} company. I'm safe in this cage, and you are not. So long, and I'll be back in camp by night-fall." ...|$|R
2500|$|I. C. Frimu {{was among}} the last PSDR figures of his age to be {{respected}} by both the Reformist socialists and their communist adversaries. The moderate Constantin Titel Petrescu praised Frimu as [...] "that admirable human example of honesty, goodness and kindliness". Rakovsky [...] who had since affiliated with Leninism and had taken refuge in Bolshevist Russia [...] was himself distressed by the news; in spring 1919, his wife Ileana Pralea wrote to Rozalia Frimu a letter of condolence, in which she said [...] "I am {{in a position to}} add <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> companion's greatest hopes has extinguished with Frimu." [...] As the Socialist Party was split into the moderate groups and the newly formed Romanian Communist Party, Frimu's legacy became the topic of dispute [...] Moscovici, who sided with the former, claimed that Frimu disapproved of the October Revolution (" [...] Frimu, who had seen the Russian Revolution [...] {{a year and a half}} of its activity, never did completely agree with its methods"), and, making reference to the communist activist Alecu Constantinescu, argued that Frimu [...] "could not stand" [...] the latter's [...] "demagogy".|$|E
6000|$|... "Worse than <b>that.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> trustees. I thought I'd {{better not}} meet him; {{he might have}} felt embarrassed after {{what he said to}} me not long ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I am glad <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{remedies}} {{meets with}} your approbation,' said his father, smiling. 'For the other, you are much inclined to pronounce the cure {{as bad as}} the disease.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you {{see this}} bluff here looks all alike {{all the way down}} from the cave hollow--no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see that white place up yonder where there's been a landslide? Well, <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> marks. We'll get ashore, now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{what ails}} all of you?" [...] I asked. [...] "I have seen never a hopeful face, save <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own countrymen. You {{are not afraid}} of a crack on your curly pate, are you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How are you, Mr. Giddings? How are the cows? I carry some stock that'll {{make you}} sit up--I believe I told you when I was down your way. Of course, mine cost a little money, but <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hobbies. Come and see 'em some day. There's a good hotel in Ripton, and I'll {{have you met}} there and drive you back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Too well,' he said, 'it {{was there}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> comrades sold himself to Satan; the Virgin shield us from temptations! He has paid the price; {{he is now}} burning in the reddest place in Hell!' ...|$|E
60|$|Now, on {{a certain}} day, being May the eighth, the heart of John Grey was merry within him. He had well drunk, and I had let him win of me, at the dice, <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> three horses which most he coveted.|$|E
6000|$|... "See {{that he is}} {{not brought}} up at your apron string, but is well trained in all exercises; for we Scots have gained a great name for {{strength}} and muscle, and I would not <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> kin should fall short of the mark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Too close, 'twas," [...] said Reuben, in {{the rear}} of the rest. [...] "And as to Sam Lawson--poor heart! now he's dead and gone too!--I'll warrant, that if so be I've spent one hour in making hoops for that barrel, I've spent fifty, first and last. <b>That's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hoops"--touching it with his elbow--"that's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> mine, and <b>that,</b> and that, and all these." ...|$|R
5000|$|Roper, {{learning}} of More's quarrel with the King, reveals that his religious opinions have altered considerably: He declares that by attacking the Church, the King has become [...] "the Devil's minister." [...] More admonishes {{him to be}} more guarded as Rich arrives, pleading again for a position at Court. When More again refuses, Rich denounces More's steward as a spy for Thomas Cromwell. An unmoved More responds, [...] "Of course, <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> servants." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I," [...] said Edgar, {{breaking}} in here, [...] "wish {{to go to}} the same place, not so much on my own account as on <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> companions, who has left two very pretty little pieces of property there {{in the shape of a}} wife and a child, who might object to being left behind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I heard, by an {{accident}}, by what accident is no matter, <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{class was}} ill and solitary. I received no other description of him, than {{that he lived}} in this street. Beginning my inquiries at the first house in it, I have found him." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{an instant}} I was dumbfounded. Had the report come from down-river, I should have {{instantly}} thought <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own men had fired. But coming from up-river it puzzled me considerably. Who {{could there be}} with firearms in primitive England other than we of the Coldwater? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{always think}} my {{observations}} have a peculiar piquancy when I {{have only one}} cheek rouged. I remember once I went out to dinner, {{and as soon as}} I sat down I grew conscious of the fact <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> cheeks was much redder than the other.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Poor's burial site. The {{inscription}} includes: In 1824, Lafayette re visited this grave, {{and turning}} away much affected, exclaimed, Ah, <b>that</b> was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> Generals.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, I am, sir,' {{replied the}} worthy pedagogue; 'Mr Wackford Squeers is my name, and I'm {{very far from}} being ashamed of it. These are some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> boys, sir; <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> assistants, sir--Mr Nickleby, a gentleman's son, and a good scholar, mathematical, classical, and commercial. We don't do things by halves at our shop. All manner <b>of</b> {{learning}} <b>my</b> boys take down, sir; the expense is never thought of; and they get paternal treatment and washing in.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Robin Gibb said: <b>That's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> {{favorites}} too, It was a {{very emotional}} song, {{but a lot of}} the words just came ad-libbed. The song actually wasn't planned. We just played the record down and sang it as we felt it. We kept the original demo the way it was and laterjust added the orchestra. It's got a great feeling to it, a great atmosphere, sometimes you know you can't recapture that feeling if you keep recording something. [...] Robin Gibb ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> generals here has, among his followers, someone {{who served in the}} army, and who will teach you within the course of an hour, if you pay {{attention}} to his instructions, how to form into line, and back again into fours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not wobbly," [...] the Tin Soldier assured him, [...] "but I'm certain <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> legs is {{shorter than}} the other. I can't see it, to tell what's gone wrong, but I'll limp on {{with the rest of}} you until we are out of this enchanted territory." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was told}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> pilot friends fell {{dead at the}} wheel, from heart disease, in 1869. The captain was on the roof at the time. He saw the boat {{breaking}} for the shore; shouted, and got no answer; ran up, and found the pilot lying dead on the floor.|$|E
5000|$|... “And as a {{young boy}} who liked planes and cars, <b>that</b> was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> first {{indications}} <b>that</b> things wouldn’t necessarily go smoothly,” says Cordes. “That made me sad.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do;" [...] and Jordan {{looked at}} her {{steadily}} with a trace of concern in his manner. [...] "In fact, <b>that</b> was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> reasons for asking you." ...|$|R
6000|$|She seemed pleased. [...] "Was I {{calm and}} efficient? Well, <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> result <b>of</b> <b>my</b> study. I {{can at least}} keep my head when {{anything}} goes wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me, Mrs. Gallilee, I {{think you}} have {{forgotten}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> autumn holidays, many years since, was spent in Italy. I was in Rome, like Doctor Benjulia, after your brother's marriage. His wife was, to my certain knowledge, received in society. Her reputation was unblemished; and her husband was devoted to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, seriously, do {{you think}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> scholars, thus perfected, would make a better senator than perhaps any one member in either of our Houses?--Bright bubbles of the age--ebullient brain! Gracious Heaven! that a scheme so big with {{advantage}} to this kingdom--therefore to Europe--therefore to the world--should be demolishable by one monosyllable from a bookseller's mouth! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot," [...] Ronald Mervyn answered. [...] "I {{found as}} I was {{starting}} to come out this morning <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> gloves was missing, and I may say at once that I {{have no doubt that}} the other glove is the one I lost; though how it can have got near the place where it was found I cannot explain." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer No I.D. {{spoke about}} the history of the beat, and noted that it was offered to both Drake and Jay-Z before West finally decided to use it himself. According to him, {{producers}} RZA and Pete Rock had already recorded certain portions of the song, and that he and West recorded the chorus parts. Following that, he mused [...] "then Nicki did the intro and it went crazy. <b>That’s</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favorite records, just because of all the emotions that came with it.” ...|$|R
30|$|I can {{understand}} why students don’t {{want to be called}} on personally, and I'm pretty uncomfortable calling students by name in a class environment. But I think it’s important because unless I am calling on everyone, the conversation usually degrades to two or three people who like to talk to me or like to talk to the class. So getting multiple people talking in the class is an essential goal for me and right now <b>that's</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> best tools to accomplish that.|$|R
