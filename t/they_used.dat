5|$|General Dynamics and BAE Systems, who {{received}} contracts in the Ground Combat Vehicle program, criticized the CBO report, saying <b>they</b> <b>used</b> the wrong vehicle in its analysis. Officials from both companies said <b>they</b> <b>used</b> the wrong notional {{model of the}} GCV that did {{not account for the}} change in requirements made by the Army or the advancements made in the technology development phase of the program. They also criticized the comparisons of the other vehicles. The report factored cost, survivability, mobility, and lethality, ranking the GCV's capabilities as lower than all others. The Army questioned the suitability of existing design. An Army test of currently fielded vehicles in 2012 revealed that some met critical GCV requirements, but none met enough without needing significant redesign. They also note that lethality was judged with a 25mm cannon for analysis, before the Army planned to mount a 30mm cannon. The CBO report did give credit to cost, assuming the Army's goal of $13 million per vehicle. However, Pentagon cost assessments estimated the price at $16–$17 million per vehicle.|$|E
