The Ukrainian {{authorities}} said the downing was due to a Russian missile without clarifying if <b>they</b> <b>mean</b> Russian made or fired by Russian forces. The pilot managed to eject safely. On the same day, pro Russian rebels claimed the downing of up to four Su-25s.|$|E
5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of what <b>they</b> <b>mean,</b> or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E
5|$|Though {{some groups}} {{advocate}} total sexual abstinence, by which <b>they</b> <b>mean</b> {{the avoidance of}} all sexual activity, {{in the context of}} birth control the term usually means abstinence from vaginal intercourse. Abstinence is 100% effective in preventing pregnancy; however, not everyone who intends to be abstinent refrains from all sexual activity, and in many populations there is a significant risk of pregnancy from nonconsensual sex.|$|E

5|$|The “Copper-Coloured Mountain Paradise of Padmasambahva” (Zangdopari) is vividly {{displayed}} in a heart shape on every thangkha and also painted {{on the walls of}} the monastery as a constant reminder of the legend. The paintings are set on a pedestal that represents the realm of the King of Nagas amidst Dakinis (mKha-hgro-ma), and the pinnacle in the painting denotes the domain of Brahma. The paintings also depict Klu (Naga) demigods with a human head and the body of a serpent, which are said to reside in lakes (said to denote that they are guarding the hidden treasures). Allegorically, <b>they</b> <b>mean</b> to represent the spiritual holy writings. The paintings also show what is termed as “Walkers in the Sky” (mKha-hgro-ma).|$|E
5|$|The team {{decides to}} try a {{different}} location on the planet, {{in the hope of}} moving away from the sentience they believe to be in the forest. They find that the fear emanations can be felt at their new camp as well, which is in a grassland, which makes them realize that the sentience extends over all of the vegetation on the planet. Osden also realizes that this sentience has never been in contact with anything alien before; thus it experienced fear when the explorers landed. Osden decides to attempt to communicate with the sentience, with the help of Tomiko and two others. They land {{in the middle of a}} forest, where a surge in the fear response kills one of them. Osden leaves the group, and by surrendering to the fear completely makes the planet understand that <b>they</b> <b>mean</b> it no harm; and the fear emanations cease. The group tries to locate Osden, but is unable to find him; Tomiko suspects that he does not want to be found. They leave him enough provisions for the rest of his life, and return to Terra after finishing the survey.|$|E

25|$|George Lakoff, a {{professor}} of cognitive linguistics and philosophy, advances the view that metaphors are the usual basis of meaning, not the logic of verbal symbol manipulation. Computers use logic programming to effectively query databases but humans rely on a trained biological neural network. Post modern philosophies that use the indeterminacy of symbolic language to deny definite meaning ignore those who feel they know what <b>they</b> <b>mean</b> and feel that their interlocutors know what <b>they</b> <b>mean.</b> Choosing the correct metaphor results in enough common understanding to pursue questions such as the meaning of life. Improved knowledge of brain function should result in better treatments producing healthier brains. When combined with more effective training, a sound personal assessment as {{to the meaning of}} one’s life should be straightforward.|$|E

Each friend becomes aware of her original life and regains her original cutie mark with help of her respective Element, and Ponyville is quickly restored to normal. Twilight realizes that her friendship with the other ponies is a factor that Star Swirl had not accounted for, and is able to complete the spell. Upon doing so, the Elements worn by her friends activate on their own, engulfing Twilight in a bright light and causing her to disappear.|$|E
25|$|The inaugural Elitserien {{season began}} on 5 October 1975, {{with the league}} {{consisting}} of 10 teams, each playing a regular season consisting of 36 games.

The league has had 12 teams since an expansion from 10 teams in 1987, however, there has been general agreement among hockey experts that the league needs to be expanded by at least two more teams.
