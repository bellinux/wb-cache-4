50|$|There {{has been}} much debate about {{dredging}} the Hudson River that borders {{the east side of}} the Village of Schuylerville. The General Electric <b>transformer</b> <b>plant</b> dumped PCBs upstream in Hudson Falls, New York from 1947 to 1977. GE and the United States Environmental Protection Agency have come to an agreement in which GE is responsible for dredging a 40 mi stretch of the river. The first part of the dredging will end in Schuylerville. In a press release from the EPA dated February 8, 2007, the EPA announced that the dredging would not start until 2009 because of various project complications. The debate over dredging the Hudson River has created tension within the community from the mid- to late-1990s to about 2003. The debate was heated for sometime, with some residents skeptical as to whether dredging will make the problem better or worse. This is said to be the largest Superfund project in the United States.|$|E
40|$|The {{abstraction}} {{of meaningful}} diagnostic information from raw condition monitoring data in domains where diagnostic expertise and knowledge is limited and constantly evolving presents a significant research challenge. Expert diagnosis {{and location of}} partial discharges in high voltage electrical plant is one such domain. This paper describes the functionality of a knowledge-based decision support system capable of providing engineers with a comprehensive diagnosis of the defects responsible for partial discharge activity detected in oil-filled power <b>transformers.</b> <b>Plant</b> data captured from partial discharge (PD) sensors can be processed to generate phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD) patterns. This paper proposes a means of abstracting the salient features characterizing the observed PRPD patterns. Captured knowledge describing the visual interpretation of these patterns can be applied for defect diagnosis and location. The knowledge-based PRPD pattern interpretation system can support on-line plant condition assessment and defect diagnosis by presenting a comprehensive diagnosis of PD activity detected and classification of the defect source. The paper also discusses how the system justifies its diagnosis of the PD activity to offer the expert greater confidence in the result, a feature generally absent in 'black-box' pattern recognition techniques. The incremental approach exhibited by the system reflects that of a PD expert's visual interpretation of the PRPD pattern. The paper describes how this functional system design has evolved from the approach taken by PD experts to the visual interpretation of PRPD patterns...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of alien species in local floras of the Voronezh region Nature Reserve Fund. The Voronezh Region {{is located on the}} border of the forest-steppe and steppe zones. 16 Model Protected Areas (PAs), having a different conservation status and a various size, have been chosen for the analysis. The article attempts to assess: a) the degree of biological contamination of PAs that protect forest-steppe and steppe ecosystems; b) features of the alien fractions of the PAs' flora of various categories. The characteristics of PAs with respect to the possibilities and conditions for the invasion of alien species of vascular plants are given. The alien fraction of the PAs' flora comprises 262 taxa: 255 species, 5 hybrids, 1 subspecies and 1 variety, referring to 178 genera and 66 families. For the typological analysis, alien species were divided into groups in accordance with the time of the invasion, the way of invasion and the naturalisation level. The average proportion of invasive species in PAs floras is 11. 1 % (in different local floras it varies from 4. 4 % to 16. 8 %). When considering stable flora elements only (excluding ephemerophytes and colonophytes), then the PAs' local flora contamination ratio will make the average of 6. 1 % (from 3. 5 % to 8. 9 %). The largest number of alien species is noted in the floras of state reserves and state nature sanctuaries, regional PAs are characterised by a smaller proportion of alien plants. The analysis of the ways of alien species' invasion has shown that human activity on introduction of plants makes an important contribution to the replenishment of the alien flora in protected areas: 31. 7 % of alien species had left the cultivation area, 15 % were deliberately planted in the PAs. <b>Transformer</b> <b>plants</b> are of the greatest coenotic significance, out of 19 such alien species 11 are xenophytes, the other 8 species are ergasiophytes. The conclusion is made about the necessity to move from the monitoring of alien species to practical work on managing the process of alien plant invasion in state reserves...|$|R

40|$|Powertech Transformers, {{located in}} Pretoria West, {{is one of}} the largest and {{sophisticated}} <b>transformer</b> manufacturing <b>plants</b> in the southern hemisphere. The variety of products manufactured is used by local authorities, mines, industrial plants, and the utility industry. The manufacturing plant has experienced problems with the productivity and efficiency of their active assembly area. This project was aimed at optimizing the active assembly line layout and at improving the current process. The selection and implementation of the relevant industrial engineering tools and problem solving techniques helped to achieve this goal. This document describes the situation at Powertech Transformers and how the implementation of systematic layout planning and lean manufacturing will achieve potential savings and improvements. These selected techniques have been directed at improving specifically the material flow and tool usage to ultimately optimize the efficiency and production effectiveness throughout the overall layout area. The future state of Powertech Transformers has a more efficient flow of materials and operations and will ultimately improve the productivity of the area. The improvements will enable the operators and management to have more control over the process and to focus their attention on the quality of the operations and the products. It is expected that with more focus on quality that less products will be faulty, saving time and money. Thesis (B Eng. (Industrial and Systems Engineering)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010...|$|R

50|$|Spark gaps are {{frequently}} {{used to prevent}} voltage surges from damaging equipment. Spark gaps are used in high-voltage switches, large power <b>transformers,</b> in power <b>plants</b> and electrical substations. Such switches are constructed with a large, remote-operated switching blade with a hinge as one contact and two leaf springs holding the other end as second contact. If the blade is opened, a spark may keep the connection between blade and spring conducting. (The spark ionizes the air, which becomes conductive, allowing an arc to form, which sustains ionization and hence conduction.) Here, a Jacob's ladder {{on top of the}} switch will pull the arc apart and so extinguish it. One might also find small Jacob's ladders mounted on top of ceramic insulators of high-voltage pylons. These are sometimes called horn gaps. If a spark should ever manage to jump over the insulator and give rise to an arc, it will be extinguished.|$|R

The study {{takes into account}} the various activities in terms of maintenance of coaches and production of components the energy input for Carriage Repair Workshop Hubli (UBLS) and Central workshop, Mysore (MYSS). The specific energy consumption of larger workshop i. e. UBLS is comparatively less than the smaller one i. e. MYSS due to introduction and successful maintenance of many a energy conservation measures. Hence extended study was undertaken to analyse the drivers for energy efficiency and 82 respondents out of 235 supervisors were interviewed separately and their opinion on the rating of drivers for energy conservation (EC) were sought. The entire workshop supervisors were divided into four groups based on their functions viz. Electrical supervisors, Carriage Maintenance Supervisors, Production shop supervisors and lastly the Maintenance Supervisors. The result analysis finds that all the four groups show the similar ranking wherein it was evident that dedication of the top management, supervisors and staff was the major driver for implementation and successful maintenance, sustenance of the energy efficiency measures. The driver “Awareness and adoption of latest technologies for EC ” is a close second in all the four groups under study. The major areas of concern in the workshops are the aged <b>transformer</b> welding <b>plants</b> and the centralized air distribution systems with earlier technology of reciprocating compressors...|$|R
