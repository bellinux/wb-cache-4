5|$|Reformers {{reasoned}} that adequate housing could counter the drinking problems. George Pullman adhered to this idea. He {{believed that a}} good residential surrounding would benefit the workers and that beauty in the town would breed good character in the residents. Pullman hoped <b>the</b> <b>comfortable,</b> beautiful environment of his town would encourage cleanliness, industriousness and sobriety in the work force. Attractive housing with adequate living space did create good work habits in the towns.|$|E

England played poorly against Sri Lanka, with Trescothick finding it hard to build a large innings. He attempted {{to take control of}} the match with 70 at Colombo, as England tried to get something from the series, but was also criticised for his poor catching.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} was constructed of Portland stone, largely over two storeys {{but with a}} three story octagonal tower between the two wings, {{as well as a}} square tower to the north above the porte-cochère. The walls feature castellated parapets, turrets and pinnacles, giving the building the feel of a castle in the gothic style. The building has an asymmetric feel, in a picturesque style, with varying shapes and elevations to different sections. The intent was to give a castle style to the building, reminiscent of historical fortresses, but with <b>the</b> <b>comfortable</b> interior of a house.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} from injury, Bolt {{appeared}} a reduced figure {{at the start of}} the 2015 season. He ran only two 100m and three 200m before the major championship. He opened with 10.12 seconds for the 100m and 20.20 for the 200m. He won the 200m in New York and Ostrava, but his season's best time of 20.13 seconds ranked him 20th in the world going into the championships. Two 100m runs of 9.87 in July in London showed better form, but in comparison, Justin Gatlin was easily the top ranked sprinter – the American had times of 9.74 and 19.57 seconds, and had already run under 9.8 seconds on four occasions that season. Bolt entered the World Championships to defend his sprint titles but was not <b>the</b> <b>comfortable</b> favourite he had been since 2008.|$|E

25|$|In the Middle Ages, three castles {{overlooked}} the villages. One was called Schwanstein Castle. In 1832, Ludwig's father King Maximilian II of Bavaria bought its ruins {{to replace them}} with <b>the</b> <b>comfortable</b> neo-Gothic palace known as Hohenschwangau Castle.

25|$|The fashion {{influences}} between colonials and natives was {{a reciprocal}} phenomenon. Just as the Europeans influences the natives, the natives too influenced the European colonials.

25|$|A high-scoring match saw 588 {{runs scored}} {{for the loss}} of 13 wickets, with Sri Lanka {{emerging}} victorious by <b>the</b> <b>comfortable</b> margin of 60 runs.

Canada recovered from 34/2 to reach 182/3 at one stage with Vaughan making 80 and Marshall 55. Despite having wickets in hand, however, they could not keep up with the required run rate, ending up well short of their target on 264/5.|$|E
25|$|The {{high tide}} mark of {{membership}} was reached in 1965 {{when the church}} recorded 1,064,000 members. However, there were already rumblings of discontent in the church: that same year, Pierre Berton wrote <b>The</b> <b>Comfortable</b> Pew, a bestseller that was highly critical of Canadian churches, and a United Church Commission on Ministry in the 20th Century was appointed in response to growing frustration from congregations, presbyteries, and ministers {{about the role of}} ministry. The church lost 2,027 members in 1966, a decline of only two-tenths of a percent, but significantly it marked the first time since amalgamation that membership had fallen.|$|E
25|$|Membership of the RAOU, after {{reaching}} a {{peak in the}} 1920s, went into a decline during the Great Depression and the Second World War and there were difficulties meeting the costs of printing the Emu. After the War, membership numbers began to rise again. However, during the 1950s and 1960s, there was further division between the members. There were those who enjoyed the clubby atmosphere of the campouts and <b>the</b> <b>comfortable,</b> sometimes chatty, style of the Emu. Others, including those professionally involved in ornithology {{as well as the}} more scientifically rigorous amateurs, wanted the RAOU to be scientifically credible and to publish an ornithological journal that merited international recognition.|$|E

25|$|In March 1942 Hitler re-appointed Rundstedt OB West, in {{succession}} to Witzleben, who was ill. He returned to <b>the</b> <b>comfortable</b> headquarters in the Hotel Pavillon Henri IV in Saint-Germain, which he had occupied in 1940–41. Rundstedt's command of French and his good relationship {{with the head of}} the collaborationist Vichy regime, Marshal Philippe Pétain, were considerable assets. But his position was to grow increasingly difficult. Hitler did not intend giving him real authority, seeing him as a dignified figurehead. Although he was commander of the German Army in the west, charged with defending the coasts of France and Belgium against attack by the western Allies, the military governors in Paris and Brussels (Rundstedt's former subordinate Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel and Alexander von Falkenhausen respectively) were not under his direct command, and he had no control over the Navy or Air Force. He also had no control over the SS and Gestapo operations in France: the HSSPF in Paris, Carl Oberg, answered only to Himmler.|$|E
25|$|On February 4, Real Madrid {{started the}} month with a 0–1 away win over Getafe. The lone goal, a header, was scored by Sergio Ramos {{in the first}} half. On February 12, Madrid {{extended}} their lead in La Liga to ten points after winning 4–2 at home to Levante, while Barcelona had lost the day before to Osasuna in Pamplona. Levante opened the scoring with a header from Gustavo Cabral. The turning point came after a red card to Vicente Iborra, giving away a penalty which was scored by Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo then added two more goals, including a sumptuous third, before Levante pulled another back through Arouna Koné. Karim Benzema then curled home a fourth for Real to finish the scoring. On February 18, Real Madrid continued their good form in La Liga by beating Racing de Santander at the Bernabéu 4–0. Benzema netted a brace and Ronaldo and Ángel Di María each scored one goal in <b>the</b> <b>comfortable</b> win. Racing played {{over half of the}} game with only ten men after Domingo Cisma received a second yellow card for his second handball of the game and was sent off. On February 21, Real Madrid drew 1–1 with CSKA Moscow {{in the first part of}} their Round of 16 games in Champions League. The game, played in snowy conditions in Moscow, was led by Madrid for the majority of the game with a goal from Ronaldo, but a last-minute equalizer by Pontus Wernbloom denied the victory for the visitors. On February 26, Real Madrid defeated city rival Rayo Vallecano at the Campo de Fútbol de Vallecas by a score of 0–1. The only goal of the game, a back-heel effort by Cristiano Ronaldo, was eventually enough for the visitors to go home with the three points in their pocket.|$|E
