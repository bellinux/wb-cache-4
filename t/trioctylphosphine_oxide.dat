KlabundeFirst, a new tiara Pd(II) thiolate complex-[Pd(SC[subscript] 12 H[subscript] 25) [subscript] 2][subscript] 6 {{has been}} {{synthesized}} and fully characterized. Then the complex was further {{used as a}} single-source precursor to prepare nearly monodisperse palladium sulfide (PdS) nanoparticles through the high-temperature-induced decomposition in diphenyl ether. Secondly, the influence of dodecanethiol on the product distribution upon heating a Pd(II) -octylamine system was investigated. The molar ratio of octylamine to Pd(II) was fixed at 20 : 1, and the concentration of dodecanethiol was changed systematically. Without thiol ligand, only aggregated Pd(0) particles were obtained due to the reduction of Pd(II) by octylamine. When the molar ratio of dodecanethiol to Pd(II) was increased to 0. 5, highly monodisperse sulfurized palladium nanoparticles with diameter 7. 55 [plus or minus] 0. 73 nm were generated. When the molar ratio reached to 2, only a thiolate complex-[Pd(SC[subscript] 12 H[subscript] 25) [subscript] 2][subscript] 6 was found as the final product. Thirdly, we report a facile method to prepare nearly monodisperse Pd nanoparticles by heating Pd(II) ions in 4 -tert-butyltoluene solvent, {{in the presence of}} oleylamine and trioctylphosphine (TOP) ligands. It has been found the concentration of TOP ligand was highly pivotal for the formation of Pd nanoparticles. Without TOP, only aggregated Pd particles were obtained due to the reduction of Pd(II) by oleylamine. When the molar ratio of TOP to Pd(II) was less than two, well-protected Pd nanoparticles were obtained. However, when the molar ratio reached to two, only Pd(II) -TOP coordination complexes were obtained as the final product. Fourthly, we present a novel way to synthesize cadmium selenide (CdSe) nanoparticles from a heterogeneous system only containing cadmium <b>oxide,</b> <b>trioctylphosphine,</b> and trioctylphosphine selenide. Last, the formation of magnesium oxychloride (Mg[subscript]x(OH) [subscript]yCl[subscript]z•nH[subscript] 2 O) nanorods from the system MgO-MgCl[subscript] 2 -H[subscript] 2 O was investigated. By changing the amounts of the starting materials, short nanorods (< 1 micron) or long nanorods (up to 20 micron) could be obtained readily with the aspect ratio in the range of 10 - 70. The resulting magnesium oxychloride nanorods could be further transformed to magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH) [subscript] 2) nanorods by treating with NaOH...|$|R

5000|$|A {{prevailing}} {{belief is}} that <b>trioctylphosphine</b> <b>oxide</b> (TOPO) or trioctylphosphine (TOP), a neutral ligand derived from a common precursor used in the synthesis of CdSe dots, caps the surface of CdSe quantum dots. However, results from recent studies challenge this model. Using NMR, quantum dots {{have been shown to}} be nonstoichiometric meaning that the cadmium to selenide ratio is not one to one. CdSe dots have excess cadmium cations on the surface that can form bonds with anionic species such as carboxylate chains.

50|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the use of the substrate surface chemistry is the ability to readily control the areal dose of the dopants by forming a mixed monolayer of ‘blank’ and dopant-containing molecules. For instance, a mixture of boron precursor molecules and dodecene (all-carbon ‘blank’ precursor) in different ratios is utilized to manipulate the areal dose of boron. Besides the mixed monolayer formation, the areal dose can be readily tuned by using the molecular structure details of the dopant precursor. In specific, the molecular footprint of the precursor directly governs the surface concentration of the dopants, with larger molecules resulting in a lower dose. In this regard, using <b>trioctylphosphine</b> <b>oxide</b> (TOP) as the phosphorus precursor with an approximately six-fold larger molecular footprint than DPP, the dopant dose can be modulated in the reduction of six times accordingly. Moreover, the doping profiles can be readily tuned through optimization of the annealing conditions. In this case, the high surface doping density with sharp spatial decay can be obtained by using this MLD method with low anneal temperatures and short times for the formation of USJs. The ability to controllably tune the dopant dose through the structural design of the precursor and to control the dopant profile by the annealing conditions present a unique aspect of the MLD process for attaining the desired dopant dose and profile.|$|E
