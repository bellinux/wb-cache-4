5|$|A rugged, sparsely {{populated}} area, the Catlins features a scenic coastal landscape and dense temperate rainforest, {{both of which}} harbour many endangered species of birds, most notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin.

She was a prolific letter writer, and kept contact with her large cohort of friends by a voluminous correspondence. According to Hastings, she developed many of her friendships far further on paper than she could have done through normal social intercourse.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Agnew's legacy was {{perceived}} largely in negative <b>terms.</b> <b>The</b> circumstances of his fall, particularly in the light of his declared dedication to law and order, did much to engender cynicism and distrust towards politicians of every stripe. His disgrace led to a greater degree of care in the selection of potential vice presidents; had Nixon researched Agnew's background before choosing him, a national crisis might have been averted. Most of the running mates selected by the major parties after 1972 were seasoned politicians – Walter Mondale, George H. W. Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Al Gore, Dick Cheney – some of whom themselves became their party's nominee for president.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Most of {{the common}} {{techniques}} of text mining {{are based on the}} statistical analysis of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> frequency. <b>The</b> statistical analysis of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> frequency captures <b>the</b> importance of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> within <b>the</b> document only. An alternate approach would be to enhance the mining model to include the contribution of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> to <b>the</b> semantics of the text so that <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> that capture <b>the</b> concepts of the document and thereby the similarity between the documents may be found. The contribution of each <b>term</b> to <b>the</b> semantics at the sentence, document and corpus levels is determined using sentence-based concept-analysis, document-based concept-analysis and corpus-based concept-analysis respectively.

5|$|Between {{the early}} 16th {{and the late}} 17th centuries, an {{original}} tradition of stone tented roof architecture developed in Russia.
