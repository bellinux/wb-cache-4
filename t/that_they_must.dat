5|$|As an {{independent}} company, Obsidian believes <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> act and react quickly to market changes and not stagnate on any certain point. While the core focus of Obsidian was still developing character-driven role-playing games, the team {{were willing to}} try out projects that are smaller and are in different genres. The decision to develop Armored Warfare is one result of this strategy.|$|E

Henri Braquenié visited London and Bletchley Park, the British {{asked that}} the Polish cryptologists be made {{available}} to them in Britain.

5|$|During Davuluri's {{visit to}} Central York High School in Pennsylvania, 18-year-old Patrick Farves was {{suspended}} for inviting her to his 2014 prom during a question-and-answer session. Although she requested that the suspension be lifted in a Facebook post, school administrators said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> maintain standards for student behavior. Farves later stated that he regretted the joke as it overshadowed her platform.|$|E

When the van breaks down early on, the family learns <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> push the van until it is moving at about 20mph before it is put into gear, at which point they have to run up to the side door and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself.|$|E
5|$|Halley was {{the first}} comet to be {{recognized}} as periodic. Until the Renaissance, the philosophical consensus on the nature of comets, promoted by Aristotle, was that they were disturbances in Earth's atmosphere. This idea was disproved in 1577 by Tycho Brahe, who used parallax measurements to show that comets must lie beyond the Moon. Many were still unconvinced that comets orbited the Sun, and assumed instead <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> follow straight paths through the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|However, in November Justice Lloyd Hibbert sentenced them {{to life in}} prison, stipulating <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> serve {{a minimum}} of thirty years before {{becoming}} eligible for parole. He stated that in sentencing the pair he took into account {{the fact that they}} had already spent a decade in custody. In December, both Owen and West launched appeals against their conviction.|$|E

Upon escaping, they find themselves in a warehouse-like facility with Dio, Quark, Tenmyouji, Luna, Alice, K, and Clover.

He then also remembers {{the location of the}} aliens' base of operations.|$|E

5|$|Allied forces sent {{to disarm}} the Japanese and {{repatriate}} {{prisoners of war}} arrived in Indonesia in September 1945. In Semarang, {{this led to a}} conflict between Japanese forces and Indonesian rebels, that began on 15October; the Indonesians aimed to confiscate the Japanese weapons. Allied forces began landing in the city on 20October 1945; a small group was sent to Gedangan to speak with Soegijapranata. Concerned with civilian suffering, the vicar apostolic told the Allies <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> stop the battle; the Allies could not comply as they did not know the Japanese commander. Soegijapranata then contacted the Japanese and, that afternoon, brokered a cease-fire agreement in his office at Gedangan, despite Indonesian forces' firing at the Gurkha soldiers posted in front of the building.|$|E
5|$|During the Eocene, rodents {{began to}} diversify. Beavers {{appeared}} in North America {{in the late}} Eocene before spreading to Eurasia. Late in the Eocene, hystricognaths invaded Africa, most probably having originated in Asia at least 39.5 million years ago. From Africa, fossil evidence shows that some hystricognaths (caviomorphs) , which was an isolated continent at the time, evidently making use of ocean currents to cross the Atlantic on floating debris. Caviomorphs had arrived in South America by 41 million years ago (implying a date at least {{as early as this}} for hystricognaths in Africa), and had reached the Greater Antilles by the early Oligocene, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> have dispersed rapidly across South America.|$|E

5|$|EVE {{brings the}} plant back to McCrea, who watches EVE's {{recordings}} of Earth and concludes <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> return. However, AUTO refuses, revealing his own secret no-return directive A113, issued to BnL autopilots after the corporation concluded years earlier {{that the planet}} could not be saved. He mutinies, tasering WALL-E and deactivating EVE and throwing them both down the garbage chute, then detaining McCrea. EVE automatically reactivates and helps WALL-E bring the plant to the ship's Holo-Detector chamber; AUTO tries to close the chamber, crushing WALL-E when he struggles to keep it open, but McCrea is able to deactivate him and destroy GO-4, while EVE inserts the plant to activate the hyperjump.|$|E
5|$|Forward Intelligence Teams (FITs) are two or {{more police}} {{officers}} who are deployed by UK police forces to gather intelligence {{on the ground and}} in some circumstances, to disrupt activists and deter anti-social behaviour. They use cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. An unsuccessful legal challenge has been made against their use of overt surveillance, but in 2009 the Court of Appeal ruled <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> justify retention of photographs on a case-by-case basis. Any retained information is recorded on the Crimint database.|$|E
5|$|In {{planning}} its new offensive, the North Korean command decided {{any attempt}} to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to {{the support of the}} UN navy. Instead, they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it; this was considered to be the only hope of achieving success in the battle. Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union, the North Koreans were aware of the UN forces building up along the Pusan Perimeter and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>must</b> conduct an offensive soon or they could not win the battle. A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city. As part of this mission, the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to Taegu.|$|E
