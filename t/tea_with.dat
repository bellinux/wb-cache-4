5|$|Tea is also {{a widely}} {{consumed}} beverage and is served at cafés and drunk at home. Tea is prepared in many ways, from plain brewed Russian and Turkish-style black <b>tea</b> <b>with</b> sugar, to <b>tea</b> <b>with</b> lemon or milk, and, available as a common option in most establishments, Middle Eastern-style with mint (nana).|$|E

5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary fermentation, or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented tea, is often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation by age or dampness. Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the <b>tea</b> <b>with</b> aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E
50|$|Tea regions were {{famous for}} {{producing}} <b>teas</b> <b>with</b> characteristic compositions {{of the five}} taste elements: Jeju Island, contemporarily, has <b>teas</b> <b>with</b> more salt in them due to ocean winds; other elements are brought out by different means of cooking the leaves, or hardness of water.|$|R

5|$|Bubbles (born April 30, 1983) is {{a common}} chimpanzee, known for being the {{one-time}} companion animal of American recording artist Michael Jackson, who bought the primate from a Texas research facility in the early 1980s. The animal was a frequent travel companion to the singer, whose attachment to the animal led to media mockery and, among other factors, a public perception of Jackson as eccentric. During the Bad world tour, for example, Jackson brought Bubbles with him to Japan, where they both drank <b>tea</b> <b>with</b> the mayor of Osaka.|$|E
5|$|After the break, Morris added 37 runs in 14 {{minutes from}} a series of Compton full tosses and long hops, while Bradman had only added three. This {{prompted}} Yardley to take the new ball. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Ken Cranston, but sliced it in the air to point. Yardley dived and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were then taken, and Morris had to farm the strike until Bradman's pain had subsided. Australia then reached 250 shortly before <b>tea</b> <b>with</b> Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{replaced}} Johnson at the crease. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, who appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Saggers {{came in and}} only managed five in his first Test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his crease by Laker, who was still bowling in an attacking manner and flighting his deliveries, undeterred by the sixes Loxton had hit from him, rather than bowling leg theory. This left Australia at 355/8 ten minutes before <b>tea,</b> <b>with</b> only Johnston and Toshack remaining.|$|E

50|$|Although many teas {{are still}} {{flavoured}} directly with flowers, herbs, spices, or even smoke, <b>teas</b> <b>with</b> more specialized flavours are produced through {{the addition of}} flavourants or perfumes. This is particularly true for <b>tea</b> blends <b>with</b> pronounced fruit or flower aromas, which cannot be achieved with the original ingredients. Some firms such as Mariage Frères and Kusmi Tea have become quite famous for their perfumed teas.|$|R
5|$|The Australian onslaught {{against the}} spinners {{prompted}} Yardley {{to take the}} new ball and replace Compton with his fast men. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and Yardley dropped him soon after. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes remaining, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker to the fence. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were taken during a delay for treatment, and Morris had to shield Bradman from the strike until the skipper’s pain had subsided.

5|$|The {{mainstream}} media depicted Diệm as a friendly and charismatic leader who related {{well to the}} populace. The Herald showed photographs of the president eating cheese, and inspecting the foliage at the Botanic Gardens. Diệm was depicted making friends with a young boy from a Collingwood public housing estate and having <b>tea</b> <b>with</b> South Vietnamese students studying abroad at the University of Melbourne, with the females wearing the traditional ao dai. In contrast, Diệm was generally regarded as aloof and distant from the population, rarely heading outside the presidential palace to mingle with his people, and holding military processions in honour of his ascension to power in front of empty grandstands.|$|E
5|$|The onslaught {{prompted}} Yardley to {{take the}} new ball and replace Compton with his pacemen. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Cranston's bowling, but sliced {{it in the air}} to point. Yardley dived forward and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202halfway to the required totalwith 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. England began to become demoralised and their fielding continued to deteriorate. Bradman hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were taken while Bradman was being treated, and Morris had to shield his captain from the strike until the pain had subsided.

5|$|Halperin {{cautioned that}} Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, {{and some of}} the {{statements}} about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had <b>tea</b> <b>with</b> one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{moved into}} the Führerbunker on 16 January 1945. He was joined by his senior staff, {{including}} Martin Bormann. In April 1945, Eva Braun and Joseph Goebbels {{moved into the}} Führerbunker while Magda Goebbels and their six children took residence in the upper Vorbunker. Two or three dozen support, medical, and administrative staff were also sheltered there. These included Hitler's secretaries (including Traudl Junge), a nurse named Erna Flegel, and telephone switchboard operator Sergeant Rochus Misch. Early on, Hitler continued to utilize the undamaged wing of the Reich Chancellery, where he held afternoon military conferences in his large study. Afterwards, he would have <b>tea</b> <b>with</b> his secretaries before going {{back down into the}} bunker complex for the night. After several weeks of this routine, Hitler seldom left the bunker except for short strolls in the chancellery garden with his dog Blondi. The bunker was crowded and the atmosphere was oppressive; air raids occurred daily. Hitler mostly stayed on the lower level, where it was quieter and he could sleep. Conferences took place for much of the night, often until 05:00.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that same}} year, on May 14, 1998, the {{government}} {{signed an agreement}} with Astaldi, regulating construction of the ZagrebGoričan motorway by 2000. On December 11, 1997, pursuant to the agreement, the government established the Autocesta RijekaZagreb company {{to take the place of}} the Autocesta RijekaZagrebGoričan company, and awarded it the 28-year concession to develop, maintain and operate the ZagrebRijeka motorway, effectively excluding the ZagrebGoričan motorway from the original concession. At the same time, the Transeuropska autocesta d.o.o. (TEA) company was established by the government and awarded concession for development, operation and maintenance of the ZagrebGoričan motorway. Astaldi owned 51% of <b>TEA,</b> <b>with</b> the remainder owned by the Republic of Croatia. TEA was to secure financing of the project in 1998. Construction began as scheduled; however, financial and legal problems ensued, and by 1999, the press speculated that Astaldi had given up the project, but Astaldi repeatedly denied these claims. Ultimately, the government cancelled the contract and ceded the motorway to Croatian Roads Administration (ancestor of Hrvatske autoceste and Hrvatske ceste), leading Astaldi to turn to the commercial arbitration court in Vienna, which ruled in its favour. The Republic of Croatia was subsequently required to pay Astaldi 44.3million euro in damages.|$|E

Lemon tea simply contains hot <b>tea</b> <b>with</b> lemon juice and sugar. Masala lemon tea contains hot <b>tea</b> <b>with</b> roasted cumin seed powder, lemon juice, black salt and sugar, which gives it a tangy, spicy taste.

25|$|The {{addition}} of milk to tea in Europe was first mentioned in 1680 by the epistolist Madame de Sévigné. Many teas are traditionally drunk with milk in cultures where dairy products are consumed. These include Indian masala chai and British tea blends. These teas {{tend to be}} very hearty varieties of black tea which can be tasted through the milk, such as Assams, or the East Friesian blend. Milk is thought to neutralise remaining tannins and reduce acidity. The Han Chinese do not usually drink milk with tea but the Manchus do, and the elite of the Qing Dynasty of the Chinese Empire continued to do so. Hong Kong-style milk tea is based on British colonial habits. Tibetans and other Himalayan peoples traditionally drink <b>tea</b> <b>with</b> milk or yak butter and salt. In Eastern European countries (Russia, Poland and Hungary) and in Italy, tea is commonly served with lemon juice. In Poland, <b>tea</b> <b>with</b> milk is called a bawarka ("Bavarian style"), and is often drunk by pregnant and nursing women. In Australia, <b>tea</b> <b>with</b> milk is white tea.|$|E
