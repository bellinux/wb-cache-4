5|$|No receptors for HypSys have so {{far been}} reported, but it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are {{perceived}} on the cell membrane by a LRR-RLK.|$|E
5|$|Not much {{is known}} of the Caribbean monk seal's reproduction. It is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> bore a single pup every two years. Their {{gestation}} period, lactating period, and sexual maturity age are unknown.|$|E
5|$|American goldfinches lay {{four to six}} bluish-white eggs, {{which are}} oval in shape and about , {{roughly the size of}} a peanut. It is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are laid during the night. The eggs are {{incubated}} by the female alone, though the male brings her food as she nests, and most mating pairs raise only one brood each year.|$|E

50|$|Carey was {{the first}} former Archbishop of Canterbury to publish his memoirs, in 2004. The book, Know the Truth, {{mentions}} meetings with the Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles and his <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should marry. In 2005, they did marry in a civil ceremony; the Church recognised a blessing at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.|$|R
5|$|Both sides <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had inflicted {{more damage}} {{than was the}} case. The U.S. claimed to have shot down 70 Japanese {{aircraft}}, {{even though there were}} only 42 aircraft in all. Actual Japanese losses—from all causes—in the engagement were 25 aircraft, with most of the crews of the lost aircraft not being recovered or rescued. The Japanese, for their part, mistakenly believed that they had heavily damaged two U.S. carriers, instead of just one. The U.S. lost six aircraft in the engagement, with most of the crews being rescued.|$|E
5|$|Bromine oxides {{are not as}} {{well-characterised}} as {{chlorine oxides}} or iodine oxides, as they are all fairly unstable: it was once <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not exist at all. Dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5°C; it is useful in bromination reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide in a vacuum. It oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to 1,4-benzoquinone; in alkaline solutions, it gives the hypobromite anion.|$|E
5|$|Donkeys, like mules, need less {{protein and}} more fiber than horses. Although the donkey’s {{gastrointestinal}} tract has no marked differences in structure {{to that of}} the horse, donkeys are more efficient at digesting food and thrive on less forage than a similar sized pony. They only need to eat 1.5% of their body weight per day in dry matter. It is not fully understood why donkeys are such efficient digestors, but it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may have a different microbial population in the large intestine than do horses, or possibly an increased gut retention time.|$|E
2500|$|Magneto sends Pyro and Blob to {{retrieve}} the tracking coordinates for the Scorpio comet approaching Earth. This has the secondary goal of diverting the X-Men while Magneto and Juggernaut invade the X-Mansion. The Professor learns from Magneto's <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have come for the [...] "mutant power circuit" [...] of Cerebro (the mutant-tracking computer). He gives it to Kitty and orders her to flee, but Magneto manages to capture it.|$|R
5000|$|Fivush {{suggested}} that {{in conversations with}} a parent about a past experience, the child may recognize that the feelings and <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had about the experience differ from their parent's feelings, by direct comparison of what each person brought to the conversation. Hence parent-guided reminiscing helps children to organize, interpret, and evaluate past experiences in ways that give them the chance to cultivate their [...] sense of self.|$|R

5|$|For {{many years}} the dodo and the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} {{were placed in}} a family of their own, the Raphidae (formerly Dididae), because their exact relationships with other pigeons were unresolved. Each was also placed in a monotypic family (Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively), as it was <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had evolved their similarities independently. Osteological and DNA analysis has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, and the dodo and solitaire are now placed in their own subfamily, Raphinae, within the family Columbidae.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter trojans {{are dark}} bodies with reddish, featureless spectra. No firm {{evidence}} {{of the presence of}} water, or any other specific compound on their surface has been obtained, but it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are coated in tholins, organic polymers formed by the Sun's radiation. The Jupiter trojans' densities (as measured by studying binaries or rotational lightcurves) vary from 0.8 to 2.5g·cm−3. Jupiter trojans are thought to have been captured into their orbits during {{the early stages of the}} Solar System's formation or slightly later, during the migration of giant planets.|$|E
5|$|The next day, an {{argument}} erupts between Santosh and Subramaniam {{during which the}} former becomes emotional and shouts that he has lost so many small things in life because of Subramaniam. But he preferred to stay calm as {{he does not want}} to hurt his father. Subramaniam realises his mistake and apologises to everyone saying that he always wanted to take care of his family members so well but had never <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are sacrificing a lot to make him happy.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that it is}} not {{essential}} for a person to admit <b>that</b> <b>they</b> acted in a way <b>that</b> <b>they</b> knew to be dishonest, it is probably enough <b>that</b> <b>they</b> knew others would think their behaviour was dishonest, or <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> what <b>they</b> were doing was ‘wrong’.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{organizations}} {{people often}} {{have to make decisions}} about whether to speak up or remain silent - whether to share or withhold their ideas, opinions, and concerns ... problem is that in many cases, they choose the safe response of silence, withholding input that could be valuable to others or <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> wish they could express.— Frances J. Milliken and Elizabeth Wolfe Morrison, Shades of Silence: Emerging Themes and Future Directions for Research on Silence in Organizations ...|$|R

5|$|Bleach {{was first}} {{conceived}} from Tite Kubo's desire {{to draw a}} shinigami in a kimono, which {{formed the basis for}} the design of the Soul Reapers. Because of this, Kuchiki {{was one of the first}} characters of the series to be created. Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> all should use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was changed as he created the Soul Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist. Ichigo's initial design had black hair like Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl.|$|E
5|$|Following the Republic of the Congo's {{independence}} from Belgium in 1960, the country fell into disorder as the army mutinied. Shortly thereafter South Kasai and the State of Katanga declared {{independence from}} the Congolese government. The latter contained {{the vast majority of}} the Congo's valuable mineral resources and attracted significant mining activity under Belgian rule. Many Katangese <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were entitled to the revenue generated through the lucrative industry, and feared that under the new central government it would be distributed among the Congo's poorer provinces. Resulting nativist politics with support from the Belgian government and private interests such as the Union Minière du Haut Katanga (UMHK) precipitated the Katangese secession.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that his last fight was an 85-minute contest at Shrewsbury in July 1790. This was widely reported in the London press and that of provincial cities but was subsequently denied by newspapers more local to the event. There were unsuccessful attempts after that date to match him against Ben Bryan (sometimes known as Ben Brian, Ben Brain or Ben Bryant), who had by that time defeated Johnson. Indeed, these attempts, conducted by Daniel Mendoza, did not help {{the cause of his}} employment with Boulton and Watt as the firm <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were a distraction and expressed concern regarding his commitment to his work.|$|E

5|$|One {{family of}} pterosaurs, Azhdarchidae, was {{definitely}} {{present in the}} Maastrichtian, and it likely became extinct at the K–Pg boundary. These large pterosaurs were the last representatives of a declining group that contained ten families during the mid-Cretaceous. Several other pterosaur lineages may have been present during the Maastrichtian, such as the ornithocheirids, pteranodontids, nyctosaurids, as well as, a possible tapejarid, though they are represented by fragmentary remains {{that are difficult to}} assign to any given group. While this was occurring, modern birds were undergoing diversification; traditionally it was <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> replaced archaic birds and pterosaur groups, possibly due to direct competition, or they simply filled empty niches, but there is no correlation between pterosaur and avian diversities that are conclusive to a competition hypothesis, and small pterosaurs were present in the Late Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|Stirling {{still held}} the line against Grant on the American right, to the west. He held on for four hours, still {{unaware of the}} British {{flanking}} maneuver, {{and some of his}} own troops <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were winning the day because the British had been unable to take their position. However, Grant was reinforced by 2,000 marines, and he hit Stirling's center by 11:00, and Stirling was attacked on his left by the Hessians. Stirling pulled back, but British troops were coming at him from the rear, south down the Gowanus Road. The only escape route left was across a Brouwer's millpond on the Gowanus Creek which was 80 yards wide, {{on the other side of}} Brooklyn Heights.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{tympanum}} and stapes to effectively transmit vibrations is called impedance matching. Early tetrapods like temnospondyls have thick stapes with poor impedance matching, so it is now <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not used for hearing. Instead, these thick stapes may have functioned to support the tissue that covers the otic notch. Early temnospondyls, like Dendrerpeton, could not hear airborne sound but {{would have been able}} to detect vibration in the ground. Later temnospondyls like Doleserpeton had otic regions adapted to hearing. Doleserpeton has a structure in the inner ear called the perilymphatic duct, which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing. Its stapes is also a better transmitter of sound. The hearing system of Doleserpeton and related temnospondyls was able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians.|$|E

60|$|They {{heard nothing}} of it, when Jim {{afterwards}} met {{one of the}} men in a public-house he did not mention a meeting, and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> perhaps <b>they</b> had not been recognized. But the second time was worse.|$|R
6000|$|Cornelia <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> {{went on as}} <b>they</b> had <b>that</b> day, <b>they</b> should {{probably}} talk quite enough at the Synthesis; but she said, [...] "Why, yes, I should like to have you, if you won't care for my sitting on the trunk. There's only one chair." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{identities of}} only a few {{proteins}} synthesized during L-LTP are known. Regardless of their identities, it is <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> contribute to the increase in dendritic spine number, surface area, and postsynaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitter associated with L-LTP expression. The latter may be brought about in part by the enhanced synthesis of AMPA receptors during L-LTP. Late LTP is also associated with the presynaptic synthesis of synaptotagmin and an increase in synaptic vesicle number, suggesting that L-LTP induces protein synthesis not only in postsynaptic cells, but in presynaptic cells as well. As mentioned previously, for postsynaptic LTP induction to result in presynaptic protein synthesis, there must be communication from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell. This may occur via the synthesis of a retrograde messenger, discussed later.|$|E
5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E
5|$|Cystidia {{that are}} located {{along the edge}} of the cap (called cheilocystidia) are spherical, and 30–120 by 20–74µm. The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are {{club-shaped}} or elongated ellipses, up to 130–155µm in length. The pleurocystidia protrude from the face of the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development. C.micaceus may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are 60–100 by 5–10µm, but their presence is variable and cannot reliably be used for identification. Both De Bary and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of cytoplasm formed where numerous thin plates of cytoplasm meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes, but Buller <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles, and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the vacuoles enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the cytoplasm may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with one huge vacuole occupying the cell center.|$|E

25|$|The {{spread of}} the Celtic {{languages}} {{before and during the}} period is also uncertain. In the 19th century it used to be <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> these only reached Ireland and Britain in the 1st millennium BCE, but it is now <b>thought</b> likely <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were dominant before the arrival of cultural styles associated with Celts, perhaps long before.|$|R
5000|$|Males {{and females}} both {{implement}} {{the strategy of}} seduction {{as a method of}} negotiating their sexual relationships. This can often involve manipulation of other individuals. This is primarily based on desire, normally physical, as well as attraction towards them. Popular phrases often used include; ‘the language of love is universal’. [...] These phrases help to demonstrate the extensively pervasive and ubiquitous strategy use within love and relationships amongst humans. Individuals employing such strategies often do so subconsciously and will merely report the feelings and <b>thoughts</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> subjectively experienced and are colloquially comparable to ‘attraction’ or 'love'.|$|R
