5|$|Eastern South Dakota {{is home to}} most of the state's population, and the area's {{fertile soil}} is used to grow a variety of crops. West of the Missouri, {{ranching}} is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. Most of the Native American reservations are in West River. The Black Hills, a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, are in the southwest part of the state. Mount Rushmore, a major tourist destination, is there. South Dakota has a <b>temperate</b> <b>continental</b> <b>climate,</b> with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The state's ecology features species typical of a North American grassland biome.|$|E

25|$|Berlin has a Maritime {{temperate}} climate (Cfb) {{according to the}} Köppen climate classification system. There are significant influences of mild continental climate due to its inland position, with frosts being common in winter and there being larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many oceanic climates. Furthermore, Berlin is classified as a <b>temperate</b> <b>continental</b> <b>climate</b> (Dc) under the Trewartha climate scheme.|$|E

50|$|Stykkishólmur {{features}} a true subpolar oceanic climate, the least cold {{of all the}} polar climates, with cool summers (<10 °C, considered by most as the limit of polar climates) but with winter averages less cold than cities much further south featuring <b>temperate</b> <b>continental</b> <b>climates,</b> such as Chicago, Milwaukee, Toronto, or Denver, because of the moderating effect of ocean currents.|$|R

25|$|Being in {{the centre}} of the North America, Saskatchewan is far removed from the moderating effects of any large body of water and {{therefore}} has a <b>temperate</b> <b>continental</b> <b>climate,</b> Köppen climate classification types BSk, Dfb and Dfc. Hot to warm summers and cold winters mean that the annual temperature range can be up to 65°C. On average, Saskatchewan has 211 days per year when the temperature drops below freezing. Plough winds, Supercell hail or high precipitation rain storms and tornadoes are eventful summer occurrences. Midale reached 45°C (113°F) on July 5, 1937, the highest recorded temperature in Canada,.|$|E
2500|$|Being {{located in}} the middle of North America has its {{advantages}} and disadvantages. [...] For example, Saskatchewan is located so far away from any large bodies of water (Great Lakes, Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean) that any moderating effect these bodies of water would have on the temperature here is negligible. [...] Because of this, Saskatchewan as a whole is considered to have a <b>temperate</b> <b>continental</b> <b>climate.</b> [...] In the summer the days are very long and hot, in the winter the days become shorter and very cold, making for a temperature range that can exceed 65°C or more.|$|E
50|$|A {{winter storm}} {{is an event}} in which {{varieties}} of precipitation are formed that only occur at low temperatures, such as snow or sleet, or a rainstorm where ground temperatures are low enough to allow ice to form (i.e. freezing rain). In <b>temperate</b> <b>continental</b> <b>climates,</b> these storms are not necessarily restricted to the winter season, but may occur in the late autumn and early spring as well. Very rarely, they may form in summer, though {{it would have to}} be an abnormally cold summer, such as the summer of 1816 in the Northeast United States of America.|$|R

These are the Alpine, the Mediterranean, the Dinaric, and the Pannonian landscapes.

50|$|They are {{temperate}} or tropical plants, {{having a}} great range. They are most abundant where annual average temperatures are between 12 and 35 °C and minimum winter temperatures are not lower than -2 °C. They prefer locations with a high temperature coupled with humidity. They require a deep soil, fresh, soft, siliceous-calcareous nature or limestone-clay-silica-clay and subsurface permeable, with pH between 5.5 and 7.8. In excessively sandy or clay soils which may be affected by standing water, the plants do not grow well. Many species {{are very sensitive to}} drought, and if the land is excessively dry and of calcareous nature, they may resent the lack of moisture. At the slightest drought, premature fruit drop is frequent. Ziziphus has several relict species living in temperate areas. These species can not endure the harsh winters of <b>temperate</b> <b>continental</b> <b>climates.</b>|$|R

Alpine and sub-alpine landscapes with Koresia capilliformis and perennial herbaceous cover approximately 80% of the area. The low plain lingo halophyte vegetation desert zone contains flora species such as Suaeda physophora and Halostachys caspica.|$|R
40|$|Lichens {{from the}} genus Umbilicaria were {{collected}} across a 5, 000 -km transect through Antarctica and investigated for DNA sequence polymorphism {{in a region}} of 480 – 660 bp of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA. Sequences from both fungal (16 ascomycetes) and photosynthetic partners (22 chlorophytes from the genus Trebouxia) were determined and compared with homologs from lichens inhabiting more <b>temperate,</b> <b>continental</b> <b>climates.</b> The phylogenetic analyses reveal that Antarctic lichens have colonized their current habitats both through multiple independent colonization events from temperate embarkation zones and through recent longrange dispersal in the Antarctic of successful preexisting colonizers. Furthermore, {{the results suggest that}} relichenization— de novo establishment of the fungus-photosynthesizer symbiosis from nonlichenized algal and fungal cells—has occurred during the process of Antarctic lichen dispersal. Independent dispersal of algal and fungal cultures therefore can lead to a successful establishment of the lichen symbiosis even under harsh Antarctic conidtions...|$|R
