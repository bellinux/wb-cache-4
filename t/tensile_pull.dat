The sequence of molecular structural deformations that lead to failure are determined, and the connectivity is found to strongly control the stress-strain response and failure modes.

The failure stress is a fraction of the ideal stress required to fracture all the interracial bonds, and is linearly proportional to the number of interracial bonds.

The tests have been developed to evaluate joints suitable for use with large composite superstructures i. e. a hangar on a frigate type warship. To assess the performance of these joints under quasi-static and dynamic loading, test procedures have been developed using both shock table facilities and conventional servo-hydraulic test machines. The test procedures are fully complementary to ensure that test results can be directly compared. Test results established that the joint failed within the interface between the base sandwich laminate and the joint overlaminate. As joint assembly is a secondary process this is to be anticipated. Both the dynamic and quasi-static test results showed similar tensile loading performances; for quasi-static testing core shear failure immediately preceded joint failure, whereas no core failure was noted for the dynamic tests.

In particular we study neck formation in tensile loading of a plastic metal. We try to generalize the work of Bridgman, who considered a purely two-dimensional geometry, to an effective theory {{that takes into account}} some essential three dimensional characteristics. That extending the description of neck formation to three dimensions is necessary was illustrated by recent experimental findings of [1]. We have studied existing models from the literature that describe necking for plates and cylinders to identify the consequences of the crucial assumption of uniform in-plane stress. We also developed a new model that we have not yet been able to analyze. Finally, using work of [4] in which a power law relation between the von Mises stress and the effective strain is used, a perturbation analysis for a simple flat geometry was performed.

It was observed that {{at room temperature}} the straight and uniform a-SiOx NW demonstrated a uniform plastic elongation (without any external <b>tensile</b> <b>pulling)</b> and a corresponding uniform radial shrinkage. According to a new model {{taking into account the}} NW nanocurvature over its surface as well as the beam-induced athermal activation, a kinetic relationship between the shrinking radius and the irradiation time was established. The fitting results demonstrated that a curvature-dependent surface energy at the nanoscale (so-called nanocurvature effect) much higher than that predicted from the existing theories is exerted on the elongation and shrinkage of the NW. At the same time, the so-induced plastic flow of massive atom and surface diffusion of atom presented as well a further direct experimental evidence for our predicted soft mode and instability of atomic vibration as induced under energetic beam (including e-beam) irradiation in amorphous materials The study has important implications for the nanoprocessing or nanostability of future NW-based structures or devices. More importantly, it further demonstrates that the nanocurvature effect and the beam-induced atomic vibration soft mode and instability effect, which have been normally neglected or inadequately taken into account in the current literature, are universal concepts and applicable to explanation of energetic beam-induced nanoinstability or nanoprocessing of low dimensional nanostructure in general.

Ultra-thin Ti layer is {{regarded as one of}} the promising passivation layer as the presence of the same prevents oxidation of copper over an extended period of time.

In SALS, HeNe laser light is passed through the tissue, and the resultant scattering pattern is analysed to determine the preferred fibre direction and degree of orientation. The dura mater was found to be a complex structure with fibre orientations ranging from highly aligned to nearly random. In the temporal region, 80 % of the samples (n= 20) were found to have regions composed of highly oriented fibres with a mean fibre direction of 6. 3 °± 0. 8 ° with respect to the sagittal plane (i. e. almost parallel to the superior sagittal sinus). These highly aligned regions were found in symmetric anatomical locations about the median sagittal sinus and had similar fibre orientations over both hemispheres. Although our sample size was small, we found that the size of the symmetric regions, which covered 14. 4 ± 1. 6 % of the total CDM area, was not influenced by subject's age or sex. The presence of these highly oriented fibre regions in CDM may be due to mechanical forces exerted on dura mater during its development.

On the interfacial void faces of Ni 50 Al, C first segregated, then it was replaced by S after longer oxidation times; the amount of segregants varied {{with different}} crystallographic orientation of the void face. On Ni 40 Al, S segregated much earlier on the void faces due to a faster diffusion rate in the Ni-rich NiAl. The apparent S diffusivity in Ni 50 Al and Ni 40 Al at 1000 C was determined to be 10 {sup - 9 } and 6 x 10 {sup - 9 } cm{sup 2 }/s respectively. Excess sulfur in Ni 40 Al greatly increased the interfacial pore density.

Materials and Methods: Physical properties, that are diameter, straight pull and knot <b>pull</b> <b>tensile</b> strength, bioburden, sterility tests were performed. Visual and histological wound healing parameters were studied in experimental Wistar rat incision wound model. Two experimental wounds about 5 cm long were created on each side of dorsal midline. Each animal received two sutures-Horsehair 4 - 0 and Ethilon 4 - 0. The sutured areas were grossly examined on 3 rd and 7 th days for visual observations like congestion, edema, infection, wound disruption, and impression of suture material on healed wound and then subjected for histological study. Results: Revealed that horsehair has got diameter of 0. 19 mm which complies with the 4 - 0 size USP standard. Straight <b>pull</b> <b>tensile</b> strength was found 0. 5851 ± 0. 122 kg and knot <b>pull</b> <b>tensile</b> strength was 0. 3998 ± 0. 078 kg, which complies with the standards of United State Pharmacopia for class II nonabsorbable suture materials.

40|$|Nanolaminate {{manufacturing}} (NLM) {{is a new}} way {{of developing}} materials whose properties can far exceed those of homogeneous materials. Traditional alloys, composites and bulk laminates tend to average the properties of the materials from which they were made. With nanostructured materials, the high density of interfaces between dissimilar materials results in novel material properties. For example, materials made -from alternating nanoscale layers of metals and oxides have exhibited thermal conductivities far below those of the oxides themselves. Also, metallic nanolaminates can have peak strengths 100 times lager than the bulk constituent metals. Recent work at MSFC has focused on the development of nickel/aluminum oxide (Ni/Al 2 O 3)) nanolaminates. Ni/Al 2 O 3 nanolaminates are expected to have better strength, creep and fatigue resistance, oxygen compatibility, and corrosion resistance than the traditional metal-matrix composites of this material, which has been used in a variety of aerospace applications. A chemical vapor deposition (CW) system has been developed and optimized for the deposition of nanolaminates. Nanolaminates with layer thicknesses between 10 and 300 nm have been successfully grown and characterization has included scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) Nanolaminates have a large variety of potential applications.

40|$|Introduction: Cannulation of {{the left}} {{ventricle}} (LV) apex is a common surgical procedure for aortic valve bypass and ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation. LV cannulation requires coring of the LV apex and attaching a sewing ring via suture. Although effective, suturing is time-consuming and apical coring can lead to bleeding complications or inflow occlusion. The scope of this project was to design a sutureless-anchoring device for an apical left ventricular (ALV) cannula system. Instrumentation, equipment, and procedures: The sutureless-anchoring device {{was designed as a}} conical spring. Five prototypes were fabricated with varying wire diameter (0. 045 ”- 0. 055 ”), maximum cone diameter (0. 85 ”- 0. 975 ”), and spring height (0. 75 ”- 1. 25 ”). The conical springs were attached to PVC cylinders to mimic ALV cannulae. The prototypes were tested through 1) leak test with pressurized porcine hearts, 2) <b>tensile</b> <b>pull</b> test using porcine hearts and an INSTRON, and 3) quantitative assessment of device implantation by cardiothoracic surgeons. Results and Discussion: Leak testing determined that the prototypes created a leak-proof tissue-cannula interface. The prototype with the largest cone and wire diameter combination was able to achieve a tensile failure force similar to that of a clinically-used VAD sewing ring. Other prototypes yielded failure forces below the VAD sewing rings. The quantitative assessment reported that the prototype easily penetrates the tissue and is quicker to implant than sewing rings. Conclusions: This preliminary study demonstrated promise for a sutureless-anchoring device as part of an ALV cannula system. A sutureless implantation method may lead to safer and faster LV cannulation surgeries, thus improving patient outcomes and reducing surgical cost. Recommendations: It is recommended to test springs with larger wire diameter and large end outer diameter combinations than those tested in this study. It is also recommended to create and test multiple prototypes of each variation of spring dimensions...|$|E
40|$|The Hellyer zinc-lead-silver {{deposit of}} western Tasmania {{is a well}} {{preserved}} example of a volcanic-hosted massive sulphide. The deposit is hosted by intermediate-basic lavas and volcaniclastics of the Que-Hellyer Volcanics, the uppermost volcanic unit of the Cambrian Mt. Read Volcanics. The complete deposit, including the footwall alteration stringer zone, is preserved. The current complex morphology of the massive sulphide {{is due to the}} combination of primacy depositional irregularities, ductile Devonian folding and brittle Mesozoic faulting. Statistical analysis of available mine sample assays and subsequent geostatistical 3 D grade modelling has revealed a classic metal zonation pattern. Whilst Cu and Fe are enriched towards the footwall, proximal to the central feeder zone recognised by Gemmell and Large (1992); Zn, Pb, Ag, Au, As and Ba are gradually enriched towards the distal hangingwall. The current observed metal distribution is interpreted to be substantially the same as the Cambrian distribution; Devonian deformation resulted in only very local remobilisation. Spatial analysis of macroscopic textures has shown a clear zonation, similar to the geometry of the metal distribution. Massive sulphide proximal to the central feeder zone is strongly recrystallised, but grades upwards and outwards to a featureless, massive texture and fmally to strongly banded ores at the hangingwall contact. A very detailed microtextural study of 174 polished thin sections was completed from samples selected on a 3 D grid through {{the central part of the}} deposit. Two hundred and twenty-two different microscopic textures have been recognised, with their spatial occurrence and features documented in a comprehensive atlas. These textures have been placed into paragenetic groups ranging through early primitive deposition, in situ recrystallisation, intra-mound veining, upwards redeposition, thermal retraction, Devonian and Mesozoic deformation-related, and fmally, surface weathering. These paragenetic groups are zoned, similar to the metal zoning and macroscopic textures, around the central feeder in the footwall. Various depositional and recrystallisation processes are postulated in an overall model for textural evolution. Microprobe analyses of the major minerals from numerous samples have shown variation according to texture and position within the overall orebody zonation. Significantly, pyrite shows considerable reduction in trace element content as crystallinity increases towards the proximal base of the sulphide mound. Early sphalerite has a higher Fe content than the late varieties, early tetrahedrite has a higher Ag content than later generations and carbonates show increasing CaO content and decreasing FeO content passing from early to late textural types. Other minerals show more complex compositional variability. The classic metal and texture zonation patterns, together with evidence from detailed microprobe analysis lend support to a mound refining genetic model, similar to that proposed by Eldridge et al. (1983) for the Kuroko volcanic·hosted massive sulphide deposits. The Hellyer genetic model postulates that a hydrothermal system was focussed at the intersection of a normal graben fault with a transfer fault on the Cambrian seafloor. These faults tapped a deep heat source and as temperature increased, rising hot solutions saturated with base and precious metals and reduced sulphur, began to vent into the cold, oxygenated seawater. Initially, barite/anhydrite and cherty crusts were deposited on the seafloor overlying the core of the footwall alteration zone. These crusts, by partly capping the system, allowed higher temperature deposition of primitive melnikovite pyrite and sphalerite/wurtzite, by replacement of pre-existing sulphates, and within voids, just below the mound surface. As the mound grew, these depositional processes moved upwards and outwards, away from the central feeder. Much higher temperatures in the lower part of the mound, gradually recrystallised and refined the primitive pyrite, expelling contaminant trace elements to be redeposited in higher, cooler parts of the mound. The growing mound became unstable, depositing clastic massive sulphide in adjacent basins that were eventually enveloped by the expanding higher temperature hydrothermal system, recrystallising and partially destroying the original fragmental framework. When the mound reached its ultimate extent, rotation of the stress regime closed off access to the heat and fluid sources and temperatures in the system decreased. As volcaniclastic mass flows and pillow lavas buried and preserved the deposit, the waning phase led to further deposition oflower temperature mineralisation, increasingly deeper within the mound in available voids. Devonian deformation annealed and extended the ductile sphalerite· galena rich distal hangingwall zones and introduced <b>tensile</b> <b>pull</b> apart fractures in the more proximal pyritic zones. All minerals, except pyrite, were locally remobilised into newly created voids. Mesozoic brittle wrench faulting brecciated pyritic areas causing minor remobilisation of minerals into late narrow cracks that cut across all earlier textural features...|$|E

30|$|Wire Electrical {{discharge}} machining (WEDM) has higher capability for cutting complex shapes with high precision for very hard materials without using {{high cost of}} cutting tools. During the WEDM process, the wire behaves like a metal string, straightened by two axial pulling forces and deformed laterally by a sum of forces from the discharge process. Major forces acting on the wire can be classified into three categories. The first is a <b>tensile</b> force, <b>pulling</b> the wire from both sides in axial direction and keeping it straight. The second is the dielectric flushing force that comes from circulation of the dielectric fluid in the machining area. The third category consists of forces of different kinds resulting from sparking and discharging. Large amplitude of wire vibration leads to large kerf widths, low shape accuracies, rough machined surfaces, low cutting speeds and high risk of wire breakage. Such tendencies for poor machining performance due to wire instability behavior appear with thinner wires.|$|R

Some of the scales were adhesion-tested by applying a <b>tensile</b> load to <b>pull</b> the scale away from the substrate. Finally, ruby fluorescence {{was used to measure}} in-plane strains in the oxide scales and values correlated with scale microstructures...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{installing}} fragile, {{high temperature insulation}} batting in an elongated cavity or in a resilient wire sleeve to form a resilient seal. The batting is preformed to rough dimensions and wrapped in a plastic film, the film being of a material which is fugitive at a high temperature. The film is heat sealed and trimmed to form a snugly fit skin which overlaps at least at one end to permit attachment of a pull cord. The film absorbs the <b>tensile</b> force of <b>pulling</b> the film enclosed batting through the cavity or wire mesh sleeve and is subsequently driven off by high temperature baking, leaving only the insulation in the cavity or wire mesh sleeve...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of microstructure on the ambient temperature embrittlement from hydrogen isotopes and decay helium in 21 Cr- 6 Ni- 9 Mn stainless steel. Hydrogen and tritium-exposed 21 Cr- 6 Ni- 9 Mn stainless steel <b>tensile</b> samples were <b>pulled</b> to failure and then characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and optical microscopy. This study determined that ductility differences between annealed and high-energy-rate-forged (HERF) stainless steel containing tritium and its decay product, helium, could be related to differences in the helium bubble microstructures. The HERF microstructures were more resistant to tritium-induced embrittlement than annealed microstructures because the high number density of helium bubbles on dislocations trap tritium within the matrix and away from the grain boundaries...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{numerical}} {{models are}} developed {{to predict the}} true behavior of portal frames at elevated temperature. These models are fully capable of capturing the snap-through-buckling and the post-buckling behaviour. It is found that after buckling, the rafter takes the cantenary shape whose compressive stress is transformed into <b>tensile</b> stress and <b>pulls</b> {{the top of the}} column inward. A parametric study on the rotational stiffness of the column base is conducted. It was found that at a lower rotational stiffness, the structure experiences snap-through at lower temperature; and increase of rotational stiffness provides stabilization of rafter and which yields a higher buckling temperature. Increasing the partial strength of column base increases the snap-through buckling temperature...|$|R
30|$|When {{the rods}} {{were in the}} same {{slenderness}} ratio λ but different threaded rod diameters d, the influence of the threaded rod diameter d on peak load was analyzed. As Fig.  3 showed that the peak load increased with threaded rod diameters. When λ =  5, as threaded rod diameters increasing, the failure mode of three series samples (M 8, M 12, M 16) changed from threaded rod <b>tensile</b> fracture to <b>pull</b> out fracture. However, when λ ≥  10, the failure mode of three series samples (M 8, M 12, M 16) was same which was threaded rod tensile fracture (Table  1). Therefore, to satisfy the utilization of glued threaded rods connection bamboo glulam in engineering and structure, λ ≥  10 was very necessary.|$|R
40|$|Golgi {{morphology}} {{and function}} has fascinated scientists for decades; however, {{it was unclear}} how the two were related. Our research delving into the function of GOLPH 3 provides evidence for how Golgi morphology relates to Golgi trafficking. We identified GOLPH 3 as a novel PtdIns(4) P-binding protein. We found that GOLPH 3 requires PtdIns(4) P for its localization at the Golgi. We also showed that GOLPH 3 binds to MYO 18 A, which results in a <b>tensile</b> force that <b>pulls</b> vesicles off the trans-Golgi. We showed that GOLPH 3, MYO 18 A, and F-actin are all required for trafficking from the Golgi. The tensile force also stretches the Golgi and creates the Golgi ribbon that extends around the nucleus. Therefore, we identified a novel mechanism that explains how Golgi trafficking results in the extended Golgi ribbon. While we {{have an understanding of}} how GOLPH 3 functions, it was unclear how GOLPH 3 is regulated. To better understand its regulation, we performed immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry experiments to identify its phosphorylation sites. We found that T 143 and T 148 were phosphorylated. By analyzing the sequences surrounding these sites, we noticed that T 143 and Q 144 comprise a "TQ" motif, which are recognized by kinases in the DNA damage pathway. Thus, we examined whether DNA damage has any effect on Golgi morphology, and we found that it causes Golgi dispersal. We showed that DNA damage-induced Golgi dispersal requires phosphorylation of GOLPH 3, as well as MYO 18 A and F-actin. Our extensive data argue that DNA-PK is the kinase that phosphorylates GOLPH 3 on the TQ motif. We also demonstrated that DNA damage increases the interaction between GOLPH 3 and MYO 18 A, thereby increasing the <b>tensile</b> force <b>pulling</b> on the Golgi membranes to elicit a dispersed Golgi. Because GOLPH 3 was previously identified as an oncogene, we measured survival after DNA damage, and we found that GOLPH 3, MYO 18 A, and DNA-PK are required for survival after DNA damage. Furthermore, knockdown of GOLPH 3 or MYO 18 A increases apoptosis levels after DNA damage. Our data provide new insight into how the DNA-PK/GOLPH 3 /MYO 18 A/F-actin pathway causes dramatic Golgi reorganization. These results will have implications for cancer therapy, as inhibition of this pathway in the presence of DNA damage strikingly increases cell death...|$|R
