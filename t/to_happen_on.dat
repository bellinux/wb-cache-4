5|$|With {{almost four}} years gone in his government's five-year term, in mid-1939 Mackenzie King {{considered}} an election and asked British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in early August if he thought anything was likely <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> the international scene. Chamberlain warned of unsettled conditions on the German—Polish border; Britain had promised to assist Polish independence {{in the event of}} war. Mackenzie King decided to wait to hold an election. On 1 September, Germany invaded Poland. Mackenzie King recalled Parliament into session beginning 7 September, and Canada declared war on Germany. Before adjourning on 13 September, Parliament passed legislation creating a Department of Munitions and Supply.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} source of salty water are infrequent inflows of North Sea water into the Baltic. Such inflows, important to the Baltic ecosystem because of the oxygen they transport into the Baltic deeps, used <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> average every {{four to five years}} until the 1980s. In recent decades they have become less frequent. The latest four occurred in 1983, 1993, 2003 and 2014 suggesting a new inter-inflow period of about ten years.|$|E
25|$|In early April 2016, {{as part of}} an {{initiative}} to become more environmental-friendly, Apple sent an email to employees of Apple Stores that they would begin a transition process with their shopping bags, moving away from the plastic bags that customers get when they buy products in the stores, and switching to paper bags with 80% recyclable materials, with the company expecting the transition <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> April 15. In the email, Apple also wrote that employees should first ask the customer if they want a bag, rather than giving them one without asking.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the Paris summit, France—which {{was in charge of the}} EU presidency—and Egypt held the co-presidency. Since then, France had been signing {{agreements}} with the different rotator presidencies of the EU (the Czech Republic, Sweden and Spain) in order to maintain the co-presidency for alongside Egypt. The renewal of the co-presidency was supposed <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> the second Union for the Mediterranean Summit. However, due to the two postponements of the summit, there has been no chance to decide which countries will take over the co-presidency.|$|E

25|$|Monster in the Box {{began with}} Grissom {{returning}} from a four-week sabbatical. As he opened up a package delivered to his office, he was shocked to find another miniature. Calling the team in immediately, he realized from a pre-dated newspaper in the model that the murder had yet <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> <b>On</b> {{the cover of the}} mini newspaper was a fourth image of the bloodied doll. In the miniature, a Caucasian woman was found lying on her back on her couch, with a pillow. On the pillow were traces of her make-up, leading the CSI’s to assume that she would be smothered to death with it.|$|E
25|$|The Ten Minute Takeover - This feature {{began on}} the {{afternoon}} show, usually happening daily at about 15:00, {{and moved to the}} drivetime show happening straight after Newsbeat at 18:00, Monday to Thursday. Listeners contact the show requesting a song, of which three are chosen, one each from the text, Facebook and Twitter. The following criteria have to be met in order for it to be played: it must not have been played on the show already that day, and it must be in the Radio 1 computer system. This second rule has created much controversy over the years, because songs are regularly not in the system, leading Greg to criticize the 'music police', who delete songs they consider to be too old for the station. The feature is a parody of the former 'Ten Hour Takeover' request feature that used <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> Bank Holidays.|$|E
25|$|German railway {{operator}} Deutsche Bahn {{at first}} limited {{the maximum speed}} of its trains to 200km/h (124mph), then all services on the domestic InterCity/InterCityExpress network {{as well as the}} local services in Northern and Western Germany were discontinued from 17:15 CET on 18 January onwards, as major main lines (Bremen-Hannover, Hamburg-Hanover, Bremen-Osnabrück) and many branch lines were affected by the storm. In an unprecedented move, Deutsche Bahn discontinued virtually all train services in Germany at 19:30 CET until further notice, with only very limited local services running on a per-line decision basis. Trains currently on the lines would stop at the next station and stay there, leaving passengers stranded all over Germany in the tens of thousands. Later, as the situation was worsening, trains were left open for those passengers unable to find a hotel to sleep in. In major affected stations, such as Münster and Hanover, air raid shelters in the stations were opened up for the night, with the Red Cross issuing blankets to stranded passengers. Train services were resumed on the morning of 19 January, but cancellations and delays continued during the weekend as 34,000kilometres (21,100mi) of track needed to be checked and cleared. The DB was faced by the massive challenge of getting its network into working order again after coming to a full stop during the night, the first such event ever <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> the German railway network in peacetime. On 18 January, an InterCity train ran into a tree that had fallen onto the tracks between Elmshorn and Westerland. One of the locomotives was damaged, no casualties were reported. An InterCity train with 450 passengers on board was stuck near Diepholz and had to be evacuated, Duisburg Hauptbahnhof station was suffering from a power outage {{as the result of a}} grid failure.|$|E

500|$|For {{the final}} {{shot of the}} season, Benioff felt that the shot of Daenerys making her way to Westeros was a monumental part in the series's history, saying [...] "That shot of Dany's fleet making {{its way out of}} the Slaver's Bay towards the Narrow Sea and home is {{probably}} the biggest thing <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> the show thus far, that's the thing we've been waiting for since the pilot episode of the first season." [...] He continued, [...] "It hasn't been a smooth road. That's the shot we're going to leave everyone with; it was a real thrill to see her, with Tyrion by her side, heading west." ...|$|E

It's not just {{that the world has}} said Pinkerton isn't worth a shit, but that the Blue album wasn't either. It was a fluke. It was the [...] video. I'm a shitty songwriter." [...] In 2001, he told Entertainment Weekly: [...] "It's a hideous record... It was such a hugely painful mistake that happened in front {{of hundreds of thousands of}} people and continues <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> a grander and grander scale and just won't go away. It's like getting really drunk at a party and spilling your guts in front of everyone and feeling incredibly great and cathartic about it, and then waking up the next morning and realizing what a complete fool you made of yourself." ...|$|E

You {{want me to tell you}} what’s going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>on</b> Sunday? We’re going to have 400 miles of some stuff happening, but then 100 miles of a lot of things happening. We’re going to have six or seven cautions in the last 100 laps, it’s going to be a short race to [...] chequered [...] and that’s what’s going to happen." [...] The second event took one hour, five minutes and 54 seconds to complete and the margin of victory was 0.005 seconds. A crowd of 80,000 people attended the races. The races had a television audience of 3.303 million people.|$|E

2500|$|Catcher's {{interference}} {{is called}} when the catcher physically hinders the batter's opportunity to legally swing at a pitched ball.
