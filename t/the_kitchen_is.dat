5|$|On {{the second}} floor is the hall, with a kitchen occupying the jamb, and later {{passages}} connecting {{to the east and}} west ranges. The hall has a large carved stone fireplace of around 1500, and once had a timber ceiling, probably painted. The kitchen was replaced by a larger one in the 16th-century east range, and converted into a bedroom. A smaller fireplace was inserted into the large kitchen hearth, and larger windows added. The next storey, accessed via a spiral stair, contained a windowless room in the vault above the hall ceiling. Above <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>is</b> the lord's bedroom, the only original private chamber in the building. The stairs continue to give access to parapet walks around the stone-flagged roof. A further storey was added to the jamb in the sixteenth century, containing a single chamber. The exterior of the castle formerly had two timber balconies, or viewing platforms, one overlooking the gardens to the south, and one looking east across the Lothian countryside.|$|E
5|$|While {{overseen by}} Heston Blumenthal, the head chef in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>is</b> Ashley Palmer-Watts. Palmer-Watts has {{previously}} worked with Blumenthal since 1999, and {{for five years}} was head chef at Blumenthal's other restaurant, the three Michelin starred The Fat Duck. The two chefs researched historical menu choices {{with help from the}} British Library and food historians. Blumenthal's first experience of historical cuisine was in 2000 when he discovered a recipe for roast chicken which required the bird to be plucked alive, and then cooked with a small volume of mercury. This was further enhanced as he filmed Heston's Feasts for Channel 4, in which he created a variety of feasts from different historical eras including Tudor, Medieval and Victorian. Despite being called Dinner, the restaurant is also open for lunch as the meaning of the name is intended to be the main meal of the day, regardless of the time at which it is eaten.|$|E

25|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>is</b> {{linked to the}} invention of the cooking range or stove and the development of water infrastructure capable of supplying running water to private homes. Food was cooked over an open fire. Technical advances in heating food in the 18th and 19th centuries changed the architecture of the kitchen. Before the advent of modern pipes, water was brought from an outdoor source such as wells, pumps or springs.|$|E
25|$|The {{northwest}} side {{can be broken}} down into three sections, each corresponding to the interior room it encloses. All the sections are plank construction with slab exterior. Each of the three sections contains a window. The first window looks into the bedroom and a double hung two-over-two sash measuring ten inches high by eight inches wide. The second window looks into the bathroom, and is identical to the bedroom window. The third window, looking into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>is</b> a two-over-two casement measuring ten inches high by fourteen inches wide.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>was</b> {{open from}} December to March, {{seven days a}} week, weather permitting. [...] Advertisements were placed in local {{newspapers}} such as the Daily Chronicle and The Journal and Courant to solicit donations for <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>The</b> donations <b>were</b> used to pay <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> staff and buy the provisions for the soup. The names of prominent contributors were also listed in those newspapers and annual receipts and expenditures were also published in <b>the</b> press. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>was</b> run by a committee of prominent townsmen, including Thomas Pumphrey, Henry E Armstrong, James Joicey and the banker Thomas Hodgkin.|$|R

25|$|The {{kitchen was}} one of the busiest rooms in the home. The {{mistress}} supervised female servants preparing food, medicines and pot-pourri, and there would be a stream of tradesmen, estate workers, errand boys and servants of visiting gentry. At meal times the servants gathered to eat from wooden platters. When the hall was built, food may have been cooked over a large fire {{at one end of the}} Great Hall but, by the time of the inventory of 1611, the kitchen occupied a separate room in the east wing. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>is</b> divided from the living quarters by the screens passage. The 17th-century fireplace, replaced in the 19th century, would have been wider and larger.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} {{takes advantage}} of the sloping site to include a sub-floor dining room which runs the length of the stand beneath the front seating. This is accessed via stairs at the front which lead to a number of sets of entrance doors just below ground level. This dining room has been refurbished, with new entrance doors, new leadlight windows and a false ceiling. Most of the original arched leadlight windows at each end have been sheeted over. Behind the dining room, cut into the slope of the land, is a long kitchen. At the southeast end of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>is</b> a store room and a steep timber stair leading up to the service entrance. There are also toilets at the sub-floor level, accessed externally. The men's toilet is located at the southeast end of the building and the women's at the northwest end.|$|E

Sonya wonders if it will be weird using stand-ins on such an important day, but Toadie assures her {{that it will be}} fine. He also mentions that he is starting to feel relieved that nothing serious has gone wrong. Just as they discuss their honeymoon, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) calls round to tell the couple that the ballroom at Lassister's Hotel has raw sewage running through it and <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>is</b> out of order. Toadie asks Paul how they can have the reception there and Paul tells them that he has arranged a marquee for them in the hotel's grounds. He will also give them the use of a suite for the day, as a gesture of good will. After Paul leaves, Sonya tries to calm Toadie down.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} floor are located the parlor, the library, two dining rooms, and the kitchen. One of the dining rooms {{is located in the}} western wing, off of the hallway, and was used {{primarily}} used by the family for smaller meals like breakfast or tea. <b>The</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>is</b> also in the wing, directly adjacent to the dining room. The other dining room, located in the front western side of the main house, was used only for formal dinners and as the sitting room where the men would converse after dinner. The fireplace in the room was enclosed in marble when Buchanan bought Wheatland and had a furnace installed. Across the hall, {{on the other side of}} the main house is the parlor, where the women guests would congregate after dinner. The library is located off the hallway in the east wing. The woodwork, doors, a bookcase, and a bookshelf built into the wall were grained to resemble oak. The shelves in the bookshelf no longer exist; but, the backboard of the bookshelf is visible, as is the plaster wall made to resemble wood. Two mahogany bookcases, flanking the fireplace in the library, were furnished by Jenkins and having been sold to each successive owner by the previous one. The library was primarily used by Buchanan as the place to meet with guests.|$|E

500|$|The pared-down {{approach}} {{can also be}} seen in the way the business is run. Carlson maintains a staff of only four people to run his restaurant – himself and three other chefs. Schwa has no receptionist, waiters, or other support staff. [...] Schwa's chefs do every job in the restaurant ranging from taking orders to busing tables. Tables are small, simple, and have none of the usual restaurant amenities – no flowers, candles, salt, or pepper. The decor is minimalist, and <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>is</b> viewable by patrons in the dining room.|$|E

500|$|The {{economy of}} Puri is {{dependent}} on tourism {{to the extent of}} about 80 percent. The temple is {{the focal point of the}} city and provides employment to the people of the town. Agricultural production of rice, ghee, vegetables and so forth of the region meet the large requirements of the temple. Many settlements around the town exclusively cater to the other religious requirements of the temple. The temple administration employs 6,000 men to perform the rituals. The temple also provides economic sustenance to 20,000 people. According to Colleen Taylor Sen an author on food and travel, writing on the food culture of India, the temple kitchen has 400 cooks serving food to as many as 100,000 people,. According to J Mohapatra, Director, Ind Barath Power Infra Ltd (IBPIL), <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>is</b> known as [...] "a largest and biggest kitchen of the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Over time, and {{particularly}} with the colonization of Madagascar by the French, these earthen houses (known as trano gasy – [...] "Malagasy house") underwent constant evolution. [...] The simplest form of earthen house is one or more stories tall, rectangular, and features a thatched roof with slightly overhanging eaves to direct rain away from the foundation and thereby prevent its erosion. [...] Wealthier families replace the thatch with clay roofing tiles and construct a veranda on the west face of the building supported by four slender equidistant columns; this design is even more effective at protecting the building's foundations from the eroding effects of rainfall. [...] Further expansion often entails the enclosure of the western veranda in wood {{and the construction of}} an open veranda on the eastern face of the building, and so forth, leading to wrap-around verandas, the connection of two separate buildings with a covered passage, the incorporation of French wrought-iron grills or glass panels into verandas, the application of painted concrete over the brick surface and other innovations. [...] In suburban and rural zones, the ground floor of the trano gasy is often reserved as a pen for livestock, while the family inhabits the upper floors. [...] The entrance typically faces west; <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>is</b> often to the south, while the family sleeps {{in the northern part of}} the building. [...] This configuration is consistent with that seen in the traditional Zafimaniry houses and reflects traditional cosmology.|$|E
500|$|The temple {{is built}} on an {{elevated}} platform (of about [...] area), [...] above the adjacent area. The temple rises to a height of [...] above the road level. The temple complex covers an area of [...] There are four entry gates in four cardinal directions of the temple, each gate located at {{the central part of}} the walls. These gates are: [...] the eastern gate called the Singhadwara (Lions Gate), the southern gate known as Ashwa Dwara (Horse Gate), the western gate called the Vyaghra Dwara (Tigers Gate) or the Khanja Gate, and the northern gate called the Hathi Dwara or (elephant gate). These four gates symbolize the four fundamental principles of Dharma (right conduct), Jnana (knowledge), Vairagya (renunciation) and Aishwarya (prosperity). The gates are crowned with pyramid shaped structures. There is a stone pillar in front of the Singhadwara, called the Aruna Stambha {Solar Pillar}, [...] in height with 16 faces, made of chlorite stone; at the top of the stamba an elegant statue of Arun (Sun) in a prayer mode is mounted. This pillar was shifted from the Konarak Sun Temple. The four gates are decorated with guardian statues in the form of lion, horse mounted men, tigers, and elephants in the name and order of the gates. A pillar made of fossilized wood is used for placing lamps as offering. The Lion Gate (Singhadwara) is the main gate to the temple, which is guarded by two guardian deities Jaya and Vijaya. The main gate is ascended through 22 steps known as Baisi Pahaca, [...] which are revered, as it is believed to possess [...] "spiritual animation". Children are made to roll down these steps, from top to bottom, to bring them spiritual happiness. After entering the temple, on the left side, there is a large kitchen where food is prepared in hygienic conditions in huge quantities; <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>is</b> called as [...] "the biggest hotel of the world".|$|E
