5|$|Although the {{presence}} of an embryo per se would be equivocal regarding this issue, the conditions in which <b>the</b> <b>embryo</b> were preserved provide strong evidence that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous. There is no preserved calcified eggshell surrounding <b>the</b> <b>embryo,</b> despite {{the presence}} of delicately-preserved calcified elements from other animals at Luoping. This is consistent with the eggshells surrounding the embryos of viviparous reptiles being non-calcified membranes. Furthermore, the relative proportions of the humerus and the fibula in <b>the</b> <b>embryo,</b> compared with the maternal individual and IVPP V13898 from Panxian, indicate that <b>the</b> <b>embryo</b> is around 12% of the size of its mother. Combined with its ossified bones, this suggests that <b>the</b> <b>embryo</b> was at an advanced developmental stage, whereas crocodilians, birds, turtles, and tuataras lay eggs at very early developmental stages.|$|E
5|$|Around the 33rd day of development, the vesicles {{begin to}} {{differentiate}}. Closer {{to the back}} of <b>the</b> <b>embryo,</b> they form what will become the utricle and semicircular canals. Closer to the front of <b>the</b> <b>embryo,</b> the vesicles differentiate into a rudimentary saccule, which will eventually become the saccule and cochlea. Part of the saccule will eventually give rise and connect to the cochlear duct. This duct appears approximately during the sixth week and connects to the saccule through the ductus reuniens.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess and {{describe}} the developmental potential of <b>the</b> <b>embryos</b> of <b>the</b> wolf spider X. nemoralis collected from the reference site (Pilica) and a site heavily polluted with metals (Welnowiec) (southern Poland). For the analyses of the progress of development <b>the</b> <b>embryos</b> <b>the</b> computer microtomography was used. Adenylate concentration was measured using luminometric method. The macroscopic observations of the development of individual embryos revealed significant differences in the duration of embryogenesis (14, 5 ± 0. 5 days in Pilica vs 16. 5 ± 0. 53 in Welnowiec). The computer microtomography analyses enabled us to describe the geometry of the eggs inside the cocoon as well as to see <b>the</b> morphology of <b>embryos</b> inside <b>the</b> cocoon and to recognize selected developmental stages of <b>the</b> <b>embryos.</b> <b>The</b> concentration of cadmium in embryos in Welnowiec was significantly lower than in <b>the</b> <b>embryos</b> from <b>the</b> reference site, while the concentration of copper in <b>the</b> <b>embryos</b> from Pilica was significantly, 4 times lower than in Wełnowiec.

40|$|Summary. The oral {{administration}} of clomiphene or U- 11555 A to mice appears to block pregnancy primarily through {{an effect on}} the maternal environment, rather than by direct action on <b>the</b> cleaving <b>embryos.</b> If given during the period of tubal transport, both agents cause a delay in the passage of <b>the</b> <b>embryos</b> into <b>the</b> uterus. When the compounds are given after <b>the</b> <b>embryos</b> have reached <b>the</b> uterus, implantation fails to occur, and the blastocysts pass out of the uterus. No evidence was found to suggest that pregnancy-blocking levels of the agents have a direct effect on <b>the</b> <b>embryos...</b>|$|R

5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These genes are called the developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit genes are parts of signalling pathways: they encode transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins and signalling ligands that bind to them, and secreted morphogens that diffuse through <b>the</b> <b>embryo.</b> All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in <b>the</b> <b>embryo.</b> Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape <b>the</b> <b>embryo,</b> and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important toolkit genes are the Hox genes. These transcription factors contain the homeobox protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other toolkit genes, and create the basic pattern of the body along its front-to-back axis.|$|E

5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) is superficial and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut.

5|$|Around {{the third}} week of development, <b>the</b> <b>embryo</b> is a three-layered disc, covered with ectoderm, {{mesoderm}} and endoderm. A tube-like formation develops in the midline, called the notochord. The notochord releases extracellular molecules that affect the transformation of the overlying ectoderm into nervous tissue.

40|$|Isolated mouse whole embryos of 7. 5 days' {{gestation}} {{were infected}} with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and cultured in pure rat serum. Although the MCMV infection {{had little effect}} on the survival and development of <b>the</b> <b>embryos</b> during 3 days of cultivation, immunohistochemical analysis of their serial sections using monoclonal antibody showed MCMV-infected cells in various portions of <b>the</b> <b>embryos.</b> This monoclonal antibody, when tested with the use of infected cultured mouse fibroblasts, reacted with nuclear antigen within 2 hours after infection and also reacted with nuclear inclusions in the late phase of infection. The viral antigen-positive cells detected by the monoclonal antibody were present in almost all of the ectoplacental cone and the yolk sac and in about 82 % of <b>the</b> <b>embryos.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>embryos,</b> antigen-positive cells were frequently observed in the epithelium of the digestive tracts, endothelial cells of the blood vessels, and the mesodermal cells. In some of <b>the</b> <b>embryos,</b> viral antigen-positive cells were clearly observed in {{a small percentage of the}} blood cells. These findings indicate that blood cells, in addition to cell migration during embryogenesis, may play an important role in transmission of infectious virus into <b>the</b> <b>embryos.</b> Mouse whole embryo culture infected with MCMV can provide a model for the study of cellular tropism related to congenital infection by cytomegalovirus...|$|R
5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve {{to regulate the}} process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of <b>the</b> <b>embryo,</b> which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, {{gives rise to the}} many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|E
5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in <b>the</b> <b>embryo</b> {{in the same}} manner and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are serially homologous.

5|$|The {{clitoris}} develops from a phallic outgrowth in <b>the</b> <b>embryo</b> {{called the}} genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a clitoris or penis during {{development of the}} reproductive system depending on exposure to androgens (primarily male hormones).

5|$|The {{field is}} characterised by some key concepts, which took {{biologists}} by surprise. One is deep homology, {{the finding that}} dissimilar organs such as the eyes of insects, vertebrates and cephalopod molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as pax-6, from the evo-devo gene toolkit. These genes are ancient, being highly conserved among phyla; they generate the patterns {{in time and space}} which shape <b>the</b> <b>embryo,</b> and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes; what does differ is the way that gene expression is regulated by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, many times in different parts of <b>the</b> <b>embryo</b> and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple pleiotropic reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which natural selection would oppose.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} of the wing buds is of a thickening of the hypodermis, which {{can be observed in}} insect species as early <b>the</b> <b>embryo,</b> and in the earliest stages of the life cycle. During the development of morphological features while in <b>the</b> <b>embryo,</b> or embryogenesis, a cluster of cells grow underneath the ectoderm which later in development, after the lateral ectoderm has grown dorsally to form wind imaginal disc. An example of wing bud development in the larvae, can be seen in those of White butterflies (Pieris). In the second instar the histoblast become more prominent, which now form a pocket-like structure. As of the third and fourth instars, the histoblast become more elongated. This greatly extended and evaginated, or protruding, part is what becomes the wing. By the close of the last instar, or fifth, the wing is pushed out of the wing-pocket, although continues to lie under the old larval cuticle while in its prepupal stage. It is not until the butterfly is in its pupal stage that the wing-bud becomes exposed, and shortly after eclosion, the wing begins to expand and form its definitive shape.|$|E
