50|$|The fifth labour {{proposed}} by Eurystheus was <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>out</b> the numerous stables of Augeias. Striking {{a deal with}} Augeias, Heracles proposed a payment of a tenth of Augeias' cattle if the labour was completed successfully. Not believing the task feasible, Augeias agreed, asking his son Phyleus to witness.Heracles rerouted two nearby rivers (Alpheis and Peneios) through the stable, <b>clearing</b> <b>out</b> the <b>dung</b> rapidly. When Augeias learned of Heracles' bargain for the task, he refused payment. Heracles brought the case to court, and Phyleus testified against his father. Enraged, Augeias banished both Phyleus and Heracles from the land before the court had cast their vote. However, Eurystheus refused to credit the labour to Heracles, as he had performed it for payment. So Heracles went and drove Augeias out of the kingdom and installed Phyleus as king. Heracles then took his tenth of the cattle and left them to graze in a field by his home.|$|R
