40|$|The present paper {{explores the}} {{phenomenon}} of aggressive evil debated through different, disciplinary perspectives and its understanding by connection to the inner psychology of the person and criminal behavior. The main theoretical sources of the present thesis come from the studies of P. Zimbardo on the good nature versus the evil nature of people, S. Milgram’s work on obedience to authority, H. Arendt’s report on the ‘banality of evil’, T. Bran’s case of a lethal exorcism at Tanacu in Romania and the essay on the social psychology of evil comprised by A. Miller. The idea that initiated an interest to study the criminal nature of ordinary people and the delimitations of aggressive evil between a causal, emotional rupture in {{the psychology of the}} person and a contextual explanation was triggered by the beautiful work of Philip Zimbardo, ‘The Lucifer effect’ where he recounts the conditions, processes and results of his Stanford Prison Experiment in 1971. Hannah Arendt’s ‘banality of evil’ is also debated thoroughly in the paper because it contains solid evidence to explaining extreme evil acts, as seen in the conduct of Eichmann, Mengele or Himmler during the Holocaust. The analytical method utilized {{in order to make the}} connection between aggressive evil, the psychology of the individual and crime is Content Analysis. This method was used in order to analyze five interviews conducted in Romania that involved participants in different professions: a prison psychologist, a psychiatrist, a legal doctor and two priests. The results confirm partly the hypothesis, however, due to the relativity of the <b>term,</b> <b>certain</b> limitations have been also drawn. This study offers a different view on aggressive evil, trying to focus mostly on the extreme acts, thus, avoiding confusion or biased opinions that a simple take on ‘evil’ would entail. However, there is still room for further improvement, and, as the results shown, the study could be extended and applied to future research on the psychology of evil, a discipline that is, unfortunately non-existent in the academic world...|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since the}} advent of {{commercial}} flight vehicles, one goal of designers has been to develop aircraft that can fly faster and carry more passengers than before. After the development of practical supersonic military aircraft, this desire was naturally manifested in a search for a practical supersonic commercial aircraft. The first and, to date, only supersonic civil transport is the Concorde, manufactured by a consortium of British and French aerospace companies. Unfortunately, due to a number of factors, including low passenger capacity and limited range, the Concorde has not been an economic success. It {{is for this reason that}} there is considerable interest in developing a design for a supersonic civil transport that addresses some of the inadequacies of the Concorde. For the design of such an aircraft to be feasible in the near <b>term,</b> <b>certain</b> guidelines must be established at the outset. Based upon the experience with the Concorde, whose 100 -passenger capacity is not large enough for profitable operation, a minimum capacity of 250 passengers is desired. Second, to date, because of the limited range of the Concorde, supersonic commercial flight has been restricted to trans-Atlantic routes. In order to broaden the potential market, any new design must have the capability of trans-Pacific flight. A summary of the potential markets involved is presented. Also, because of both the cost and complexity involved with actively cooling an entire aircraft, an additional design constraint is that the aircraft as a whole be passively cooled. One additional design constraint is somewhat less quantitative in nature but of great importance nonetheless. Any time a new design is attempted, the tendency is to assume great strides in technology that serve as the basis for actual realization of the design. While it is not always possible to avoid this dependence on 'enabling technology,' since this design is desired for the near term, it is prudent, wherever possible, to rely on already existing technology. This is of particular importance with respect to support technology such as airport terminals and runways. Based on the above introductory remarks, a possible approach to the design of a second-generation supersonic civil transport is presented here. The design Mach number for this aircraft is 3. 5. This value was chosen as it represents the limiting Mach number in the absence of active cooling. The ensuing design attempts to deal with the particular problems that are the most demanding, while relying on proven technology where it is adequate. The report clearly does not solve, or even deal with, every aspect of the aircraft design. Rather, a general direction is suggested and supported with initial, approximate calculations...|$|E
40|$|In many Western {{countries}} and elsewhere, agriculture commodity exchanges {{have been in}} existence for centuries. However, Africa did not follow the same route for various reasons. The main reason is that commercial production of basic agricultural commodities considerably lagged that of its counter parts in the Western world. By the time commercial production became a significant factor, the philosophy of government controlled marketing was already entrenched {{in many of these}} countries. It was only in the mid- 1990 ’s after the demise of communism and the abolishment of the South African controlled marketing system (not related), that farmers and stakeholders suddenly asked, how should we now go about to market our products, what are the alternatives? Western models were revisited, with commodity exchanges as a possible solution revisited. An urgent need aroused regarding the requirements for the establishment and management of a successful Warehouse Receipt System (WRS). Malawi, is one country that that has a history of government controlled marketing followed by (partial) deregulation in 2006. Despite this, the Agricultural Commodity Exchange for Africa (ACE) was established in 2005, survived and continued to grow. It has now reached a point where it {{is on the verge of}} commercially implementing and rolling out a WRS. This has obviously brought forward a number of questions. The most prominent of these are: how do you define a WRS, what are the components of a successful WRS, what are the similarities or differences between the requirements of a successful commodity exchange and that of a WRS? The objective of this study is to determine the importance of a WRS in the success of an agricultural commodity exchange. ACE has advocated for a WRS as an integral part of agricultural trade and financing since its incorporation in 2006. However, Malawi does not have a regulatory framework for warehouse receipts (WRs) so the system has to be built on contractual relationships between grain depositors, storage operators, financial institutions and ACE. Given that various commodity exchanges have been in operation throughout Africa for more than a decade with various degrees of success, sufficient literature is available on the subject matter. Much effort was made to obtain all relevant documentation, trusting that some valuable lessons are to be gleaned from these documents. This study briefly looked at the recent history on the establishment of commodity exchanges in Eastern and Southern Africa and the importance of a WRS and the role that warehouse receipt financing has played in their development. The objective was to learn from their experience and/or mistakes and to benefit from their success. Over recent years, the role, benefits and in some cases, the reasons for the failure of commodity exchanges in Africa, have extensively been researched. The study captures some of the invaluable observations made by many experts in this subject field. Aspects dealt with include, inter alia, the benefits of a successful WRS and a commodity exchange. This study deals with the requirements of a WRS, followed by the rules. The latter have been revisited and evaluated for Malawi, given its unique circumstances and the ever changing environment. Many of the processes have been visually depicted in a set of flow charts. This is followed by an analysis of the bank credit policies and procedures required for financing the WRs. As elaborated and included in the annexures, a draft product proposal has been compiled for bank product managers to submit to their respective credit policy committees seeking approval for the product. The process of financing a warehouse certificate and its redemption is dealt with in detail. In the latter part, this study looked at the role of the insurance companies and best practices followed in other countries. Other aspects highlighted are the corporate structure of ACE, government intervention, the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM), the IT structure, marketing, price information and arbitration. The study concludes that a well-designed and custom made WRS (for ACE) depends on various components. They are an online trading system, warehouse receipt (WR) financing, insurance, generic grading regulations and registered warehouses. ACE would struggle to grow and functions properly without a successful WRS. ACE could overcome many other obstacles such as inappropriate government interference, export restrictions, etc. However, ACE needs to be operationally competent and for ACE this is tied to a successful WRS. If ACE could succeed, it will serve as a case study for other {{countries and}} exchanges in the region to learn from. Lastly, a series of recommendations are made. The recommendations deal with findings from the study that needs to be addressed. Some issues are urgent and others may be dealt with over the longer <b>term.</b> <b>Certain</b> issues fell outside the scope of this study but still deserve attention.

40|$|U suvremenoj se književnosti često govori o „povratku priči“. Modernizam se u književnosti gradi svoju poetiku uvelike na suprotstavljanju realističkoj priči. Razaranje priče međutim u krajnjoj konzekvenciji vodi do nemogućnosti pripovijedanja, „bijele stranice“, pa se postmodernizam vraća priči. No ta se priča bitno razlikuje od one realističke, koju pripovjedno obilježava njezina sigurnost. Sigurna priča je sigurna u sebe, nema potrebu propitivati se te stvara dojam kao da se pripovijeda sama od sebe, a odgovara Aristoteovom shvaćanju pojma priče kao cjelovite i svrsishodne radnje koja ima početak, sredinu i kraj. Obrazac takve priče može se naći u realističkim romanima, poput Flaubertove Gospođe Bovary i Tolstojeve Ane Karenjine, ali i u historiografijama i biografijama. Postmodernizam je suvremeni fenomen o kojem se mnogo piše i govori, ali ne postoji konsenzus o tome kako ga zapravo definirati. Linda Hutcheon predlaže fluidni sustav poetike postmodernizma koju bitno obilježava njegova kontradiktornost. Na tragu takve poetike ovaj rad pokušava opisati dva postmodernistička pripovjedna teksta, Flaubertovu papigu J. Barnesa i Zaposjedanje A. S. Byatt. Na temelju naratologije, koja se povremeno proširuje elementima hermeneutike i semiotike, pomna analiza Flaubertove papige i Zaposjedanja pokušava pokazati kako se provodi pripovjedna destabilizacija priče. Oba djela naime pripovijedaju složene priče, koje se ipak bitno razlikuju od sigurne priče realizma, ali ipak uspijevaju biti priče. U pripovjednom stvaranju nesigurne priče sudjeluju kako pripovjedni postupci unutar samog teksta tako i mjesto djela u žanrovskom sustavu i njegovi intertekstualni odnosi. I Flaubetova papiga i Zaposjedanje stvaraju iznimno složene intertekstualne odnose kako s romanima realizma i djelima književne tradicije, tako i sa suvremenim tekstovima fikcionalne i nefikcionalne proze. Tako složeni intertekstualni odnosi znače i nemogućnost točnog postavljanja tih djela u tradicionalne žanrove, pa se i njihova žanrovska pripadnost može opisati kao nesigurna. Kako ključnu ulogu u stvaranju pripovjednog svijeta ima pripovjedač, analiza pokazuje kako upravo uloga pripovjedača i fokalizatora bitno pridonosi nesigurnosti priče, baš kao i odnosi među pripovjednim razinama, koji stvaraju mise en abyme, onemogućujući izdvajanje jedne priče kao prve, najvažnije i originalne. Poigravanje odnosima fikcionalnog i stvarnog te uvođenje elemenata znanstvenog i poetskog diskursa pokazuje se kao daljnji element u stvaranju nesigurne priče. Pomna narativna analiza Flaubertove papige i Zaposjedanja dokazuje kako gotovo svi elementi teksta sudjeluju u stvaranju nesigurne priče, novog pojma kojeg uvodimo, a koji se izdvaja kao bitno obilježje postmodernističkih pripovjednih tekstova. This work {{attempts}} to establish new term of uncertain {{story as a}} key aspect of postmodernist narrative by analysing two postmodernist novels: Flaubert’s Parrot by Julian Barnes and Possession by Antonia Susan Byatt. The analysis is based on narratology, intertextuality and hermeneutics. Story is a term {{that has always been}} connected with literature in general, in everyday speech as well as in critical discourse. In the contemporary fiction it is possible to witness a certain “return to the story”, which is connected to postmodernism. But the postmodernist story differs from the traditional one by its uncertainty. Although much is said and written about postmodernism, there are many controversies regarding its definition. According to Linda Hutcheon, all definitions of postmodernism (Lyotard, Callinescu, McHale, Lodge) fail to recognize its central paradox: it both uses and problematizes concepts it deals with. Therefore Hutcheon argues for a complex and flowing “poetics of postmodernism”, not its definition. Critical discussion about the concept of story starts with Aristotle, who established the connection with tragedy and saw it as a complete and meaningful action which has the begging, the middle and the end. That notion of story remained valid until the 20 th century Russian formalism, structuralism and poststructuralism, which developed the notion of narrative as opposed to the story or the plot. Aristotle’s notion, however, remains the basis for our <b>term</b> <b>certain</b> story, which can be found in realistic novels. It is a story that makes an illusion of narrating itself: the narrator is usually “hidden” to put the story in the foreground, which is itself concentrated on its content, not its form. That kind of story is prevalent during literary history and has not been seriously challenged until the rise of modernism, which has in turn introduced two new aspects. The first aspect forms a modern story, a story that differs from the certain one, but still remains a story. The other aspect destroys the story altogether in the stream of consciousness narrative mode and the French New novel. A complete destruction of the story leads to the impossibility of narration, to silence. Postmodernism therefore returns to the concept of narrating stories, but those stories are uncertain. Their uncertainty is not based on their connection to the reality, but on multiplicity of narrative devices that continually question the story itself. However, it must be emphasised that an uncertain story always remains a story, which implies the narration of events. Flaubert’s parrot narrates three different stories: the most important one is the search for the truth about Flaubert, while the other two focus on the narrator Braithwaite and his wife Ellen. Although Braithwaite tells a story about Flaubert, Flaubert’s parrot is anything but a traditional biography. It is not possible to define it within the conventiontional genre system because it not only fuses fictional narration with critical discourse but combines various narration strategies of novel and biography and forms an uncertain genre. It continually undermines every presupposition of realistic and biographical narration to form a narrative which constantly questions itself: not only a first person narrator tells a story that is traditionally bound to a third person omniscient narrator, but he demonstrates his very limited knowledge of the story he narrates. That leads to a narrative paradox: Braithwaite is an unreliable narrator, but his repeated acknowledgement of the limitations of his knowledge makes him a reliable source of the uncertain narration. His version of Flaubert’s life is contrasted to Louise Colet version, which represents a complicated mise en abyme of the three stories on the first diegetic level. Coupled with various “ontological scandals” (McHale), mise en abyme further destabilizes the story. The parrot itself functions both as a real stuffed parrot and a fluctuating symbol. The impossibility of identifying the parrot sitting on Flaubert’s desk indicates the impossibility of finding the one true meaning of a text. Byatt’s Possession narrates two main stories on two different diegetic levels, but it also incorporates a myriad of intradiegetic stories which form multiple mirror texts that reflect one another. It is therefore impossible to decide which story is the most important one, so the mere concept of a story is destabilized. The uncertainty of the story is enhanced by the complex role of the most important intertextual relations (Grimm’s fairy-tales, French Melusine legend, Fowles’s French Lieutenant’s Woman) and of the romance tradition, which leads to Possession as a metaromance. Further destabilization of the story is achieved by forming complex relations between the main narrator on the first level of diegesis and many first person narrators. The motifs of the tower, the hair, colours green and white, water, garden and possession are intertwined and can be found throughout the narrative; they form a system of leitmotifs. Since the use of motifs is characteristic of poetic genres and not of a narrative of any kind, the introduction of a poetic structure in a story makes it uncertain. Uncertain story is a story that keeps the essence of being a story, but it questions itself through many narrative strategies: the use of narrator, relations between narrative levels, intertextuality, metafiction and the use of poetic structures. That kind of story is the key characteristic of postmodernist literature...|$|E
