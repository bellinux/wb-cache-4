5|$|GJ 3634 {{is named}} for its {{location}} in the Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars; a later expansion of the original catalogue was compiled jointly by Gliese and Hartmut Jahreiß. The Third Catalogue, the most recent catalogue, was formed to tag all then-known stars within 25 parsecs of Earth (81.54 light years). GJ 3634 was first catalogued in 1987. The discoverers of GJ 3634 b worked <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at the European Southern Observatory's La Silla Observatory in Chile for over six years in search of planets that orbited low-mass red dwarfs. After the discoveries of eleven prior planets, the researchers changed their strategy to search for planets with extremely short orbits. They would first discover the system using the radial velocity method, in which an observed Doppler shift in the star's light would be measured and interpreted; and would then follow up with a search for transits, in which the planet crosses in front of and dims its star as seen from Earth. Radial velocity measurements would help determine the most efficient and time-effective means of observing potential planetary transits.|$|E

25|$|Although this {{timetable}} {{brought in}} some marked service improvements, it had two key weaknesses. First, the East Grinstead-Groombridge section was too well-served often by lengthy trains, {{as a result}} of the need to service steam locomotives at the Tunbridge Wells West depot. The small village of Groombridge saw four services an hour to Tunbridge Wells West. This caused considerable losses and when diesel units began working the section, it was possible to terminate most at East Grinstead. Second, East Grinstead Low Level fell into disuse with most services passing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Level.|$|E

25|$|The King, {{spending}} {{most of his time}} in various Serbian spas, remained relatively inactive during the First World War, although occasionally, when the military situation became critical, he visited trenches on the front-line to check up on morale of his troops. His visit to the firing line prior to the Battle of Kolubara in late 1914 boosted morale of the retreating Serbian forces and announced a counter-offensive and sparkling victory against numerically superior Austro-Hungarian forces. Another memorable visit in 1915 involved King Peter, by then 71, picking up a rifle and shooting at enemy soldiers. Following the invasion of Serbia by the joint forces of Germany, Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria in October 1915, King Peter I led the army and tens of thousands of civilian refugees <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> mountains of Albania to the Adriatic sea on a 'Calvary known to few peoples'.|$|E
25|$|Romanian theatre also {{suffered}} from economic hardships, and its popularity decreased drastically {{due to the}} increased popularity of television and other entertainment channels. Some theatres survived due their prestige (and some continued subsidies); others survived through good management, investing in themselves and earning a steady audience <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> quality of their productions. Experimental or independent theatres appeared and are quite popular in university cities. Uniter - The Romanian Theatres Association - gives yearly awards to the best performances. Some of the most critically acclaimed directors in contemporary Romania are Silviu Purcărete, Mihai Maniutiu, Tompa Gabor, Alexandru Dabija and Alexandru Darie. Also, among the most appreciated actors, both from the new and old generation, one can name Ştefan Iordache, Victor Rebenciuc, Maia Morgenstern, Marcel Iureş, Horaţiu Mălăele, Ion Caramitru, Mircea Diaconu, Marius Chivu and others.|$|E

25|$|The Fourth Labour Government {{deregulated}} {{the radio}} industry during the 1980s, selling {{the rights to}} use radio frequencies to private companies. The Wellington Māori Language Board, Nga Kaiwhakapumau i te Reo, was supporting the self-funded Te Upoko O Te Ika, and claimed the Government's sell off of broadcasting spectrum amounted to theft. Alongside the New Zealand Māori Council jointly, it challenged the spectrum sell off {{and the lack of}} support for Māori broadcasting. In one case brought through the Waitangi Tribunal, a permanent commission set up to investigate breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi, they argued the treaty gave them sovereignty over the airwaves and broadcast spectrum. They sought a share of the proceeds from the sale of rights to spectrum frequencies, and frequencies for their own use. Other cases followed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Court and Court of Appeal, with one case reaching the Privy Council in London.|$|E
25|$|But, as is {{told in the}} Rotensian Chronicle (the {{chronicle of}} Alfonso III of Asturias in which Pelayo is {{considered}} the successor of the kings of Toledo, with clear goals of political legitimacy) {{as well as in}} that of Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari (a Maghrebi historian of the 16th century who died in Cairo, Egypt, and who could have used the Rotensian Chronicle and rewritten it eight centuries later, making it useless as a historical document), Pelayo escaped from Cordoba during the governorship of al-Hurr (717-718) and his return to Asturias triggered a revolt against the Muslim authorities of Gijón. The identity of Pelayo, however, is still an open subject, and that {{is only one of the}} theories. The leader of the Astures, whose origin is debated by historians, had at that time his home in Bres (in the district of Piloña) and Munuza sent his troops there under al-Qama. After receiving word of the arrival of the Muslims, Pelayo and his companions hurriedly crossed the Piloña and headed toward the narrow, easily defended valley of Auseva mountain, and took refuge in one of its caves, Covadonga. After an attempt at siege was abandoned due to the weather and the exposed position of the deep valley gorge, the troops are said to have taken to exit <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> ports to the south, in order to continue in the search and destroy action against other rebels. There the locals were able to ambush the Muslim detachment, which was annihilated. The rest of its survivors continued south to the plains of Leon, leaving the maritime districts of Asturias exposed and weakened of defenders.|$|E
