25|$|During a {{demonstration}} of the E.28/39 to Winston Churchill in April 1943, Whittle proposed to Stafford Cripps, Minister of Aircraft Production, that all jet development be nationalised. He pointed out that the company had been funded by private investors who helped develop the engine successfully, only to see production contracts go to other companies. Nationalisation {{was the only way to}} repay those debts and ensure a fair deal for everyone, and he was willing to surrender his shares in Power Jets <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen.</b> In October, Cripps told Whittle that he decided a better solution would be to nationalise Power Jets only.|$|E
25|$|In any semiconductor, {{the band}} gap means that only photons with {{that amount of}} energy, or more, will {{contribute}} to producing a current. In the case of silicon, the majority of visible light from red to violet has sufficient energy <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen.</b> Unfortunately higher energy photons, those at the blue and violet end of the spectrum, have more than enough energy to cross the band gap; although some of this extra energy is transferred into the electrons, the majority of it is wasted as heat. Another issue is {{that in order to}} have a reasonable chance of capturing a photon, the n-type layer has to be fairly thick. This also increases the chance that a freshly ejected electron will meet up with a previously created hole in the material before reaching the p-n junction. These effects produce an upper limit on the efficiency of silicon solar cells, currently around 12 to 15% for common modules and up to 25% for the best laboratory cells (33.16% is the theoretical maximum efficiency for single band gap solar cells, see Shockley–Queisser limit.).|$|E

25|$|The {{times of}} the paths near the {{classical}} reflection site of the mirror will be nearly the same, so {{as a result the}} probability amplitudes will point in nearly the same direction—thus, they will have a sizable sum. Examining the paths towards the edges of the mirror reveals that the times of nearby paths are quite different from each other, and thus we wind up summing vectors that cancel out quickly. So, there is a higher probability that light will follow a near-classical reflection path than a path further out. However, a diffraction grating can be made out of this mirror, by scraping away areas {{near the edge of the}} mirror that usually cancel nearby amplitudes out—but now, since the photons would not reflect from the scraped-off portions, the probability amplitudes which would all wind up pointing, for instance, at forty-five degrees can have a sizable sum. Thus, this would let light of the right frequency <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen</b> sum to a larger probability amplitude, and as such possess a larger probability of reaching the appropriate final point.|$|E

30|$|The book {{discusses}} the age old {{tradition of the}} Wayang, the narrative musical performance of leather puppets in Indonesia, its intimate connection with the understanding of Indonesian Culture, {{as well as its}} relevance to current political and social issues. It has been translated for the English reader, with an introduction by the translator, indicating the immense relevance of the Wayang and its retellings for the understanding of post Suharto’s Indonesia. Post Suharto there was a call for change in the centralized methods of governance in favor of more democratization at provincial and village levels. An attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> in the reforms that were adopted subsequently, but then the lack of proper supervision and coordination resulted in the local satraps and their cohorts cornering the benefits instead of the people for whom it was meant. The author warns against any passive acceptance of whatever happens politically and strongly advocates active protests in case any injustice is being done.|$|R

2500|$|Until 1874, St. Louis carried only amateur teams – two of {{the most}} {{prominent}} being the Empires and Unions – as its top level of competition. [...] Long after other cities had established all-professional clubs, the results were almost always identical month after month, year after year: the highly skilled, professional clubs such as the White Stockings continuously walloped those of St. Louis.

2500|$|In October, at age 14, Douglas {{moved into}} the home of Missy Parton in West Des Moines, Iowa, to train under Liang Chow, the former coach of 2007 World Champion and 2008 Summer Olympics gold {{medalist}} Shawn Johnson. Although Douglas' former coach, Walker, stated in 2012 that she was convinced Douglas could {{have made it to}} the Olympics if she had remained in Virginia Beach, Douglas said, [...] "Something clicked in my head that said, if I really want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen</b> I need to get better coaching." [...] The impetus for Douglas's move to Iowa was when Walker had invited Chow to teach a clinic at her gym, Excalibur. Douglas was impressed when Chow was able to teach her how to perform the Amanar vault in a single afternoon. Douglas considered a move to Texas to train with a renowned coach there, but after that coach declined to train her out of loyalty to Walker, Douglas selected Chow. Chow was initially skeptical, since Douglas had been just one of hundreds of kids at the clinic in Virginia Beach. However, Chow subsequently informed Douglas's Excalibur coaches that he had agreed to train her, but pointed out that he did not recruit her, saying, [...] "I would never recruit anybody to my program." [...] Later on, Gabby suffered from a hamstring strain and a hip flexor injury in July. She couldn't do much during this time, but this allowed her to improve her bar skills.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Object-oriented {{programming}} (OOP) languages promote rea-soning that {{revolves around}} objects that send each other messages to collaborate {{to solve a}} problem. <b>To</b> practically <b>make</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen,</b> devel-opers write programs, aided by integrated development environments (IDEs). We claim that IDEs may be an impediment for programming, because they treat program elements as text, which may be counterpro-ductive for manipulating dynamic content such {{as a model of}} collaborating objects. In our work we investigate the usage of an alternative metaphor for building development environments for (pure) OOP languages. We settled on the object focused metaphor, which allows developers to write programs by creating and manipulating intuitive depictions of object-oriented constructs. We built a prototype called Gaucho, which embodies our ideas. We conducted a preliminary controlled experiment comparing Gaucho against a traditional IDE in the context of program comprehen-sion. Our preliminary results suggest that alternative –visual – IDEs ma...|$|R
