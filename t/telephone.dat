40|$|Abstract — In this letter, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) com-puted {{radiation}} {{patterns of}} mobile <b>telephones</b> are carefully {{compared with those}} measured in our laboratory. The question on the capability of the FDTD method to correctly predict the radiated electromagnetic fields of today’s structurally complex mobile <b>telephones</b> is addressed. Two commercially available cellular <b>telephones</b> equipped with two different antennas (one helix and one helix monopole) have been considered and the radiation patterns have been measured and FDTD computed with and without the human head. The FDTD computed and measured radiation patterns show good agreement. This verifies that numerical techniques are suitable for accurately modeling radiation patterns of realistic cellular <b>telephones</b> and, more importantly, that the FDTD method is a valid alternative to measurements {{in the design of}} new cellular <b>telephones.</b> Index Terms—Cellular <b>telephones,</b> dosimetry, FDTD, mobile antennas, radiation patterns...|$|R
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as <b>telephone</b> lines became available, it became popular to add {{telegraph}} onto <b>telephone</b> lines with an earth return phantom circuit. An LC filter was required to prevent telegraph clicks being heard on the <b>telephone</b> line. From the 1920s onwards, <b>telephone</b> lines, or balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM telegraph at audio frequencies. The first of these systems in the UK was a Siemens and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the send and receive signals. The Siemens and GEC systems had six channels of telegraph in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All of these systems used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each telegraph signal and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the multiplexed signal at the receiving end.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 1 May, the gunmen ordered one of the hostages to <b>telephone</b> the BBC's news desk.

He identified the group to which the gunmen belonged and stated that the non-Iranian hostages would not be harmed, but refused to allow the journalist to speak to any other hostages. At some point during the day, the police disabled the embassy's <b>telephone</b> lines, leaving the hostage-takers just the field <b>telephone</b> for outside communication. As the hostages woke up, Chris Cramer, a sound organiser for the BBC, became seriously ill and his colleague, Sim Harris, was taken to the field <b>telephone</b> to negotiate for a doctor. The police negotiator refused the request, instead telling Harris to persuade Oan to release Cramer. The ensuing negotiations between Harris, Oan, and the police took up most of the morning, and Cramer was eventually released at 11:15.
