25|$|It was {{suggested}} that Caltrain could increase bicycle capacity by removing some seats from bicycle cars. Initially Caltrain rejected this idea because some trains are operated at seated capacity and the seat removal would take space from other passengers. However, in early 2009 Caltrain {{announced that it}} would be expanding bicycle capacity by 8 spots by removing some seats in the bike cars, bringing bike capacity to 40 bikes on gallery cars and 24 bikes on Bombardier cars. The expansion started several months later. After <b>this,</b> <b>bike</b> capacity on trains was expanded by increasing the number of bike cars in a consist, rather than further modifying cars.|$|E

50|$|The {{unique design}} of <b>this</b> <b>bikes</b> piston makes {{cylinder}} maintenance difficult, as aftermarket companies (as of 2016) do not manufacture replacements and new old stock (NOS) parts are not widely available. Due to this, {{it is common}} practice to install the nearly identical 88-04 pistons in these bikes, which share both wrist pin and piston diameter measurements. Doing so will lower the compression ratio, but still function. Cylinders from later bikes are not compatible.|$|R

2500|$|There are two BMX racing bikes sizes. One is the 20" [...] wheel bike. <b>This</b> <b>bike</b> {{is common}} with minors and is {{currently}} the most common class. The Cruiser bikes are any bikes with a 24" [...] wheel. However, any bikes that have a wheel larger than 24" [...] will still be considered Cruisers. [...] Cruisers are more common with older racers and is rapidly growing. The cruiser style bike tends to be easier to jump and rolls better while the 20" [...] is seemingly more agile.|$|E
2500|$|Yamaha began {{competing}} internationally in 1956 {{when they}} entered the Catalina Grand Prix, again with the YA-1, at which they placed sixth. [...] The YA-1 {{was followed by the}} YA-2 of 1957, another 125cc two stroke, but with significantly improved frame and suspension. [...] The YD-1 of 1957 was a 250cc two-stroke twin cylinder motorcycle, resembling the YA-2, but with a larger and more powerful motor. [...] A performance version of <b>this</b> <b>bike,</b> the YDS-1 housed the 250cc two-stroke twin in a double downtube cradle frame and offered the first five-speed transmission in a Japanese motorcycle. [...] This period also saw Yamaha offer its first outboard marine engine.|$|E
40|$|What do {{successful}} bicycle safety {{campaigns have}} in common, and what tactics {{should be used}} in the future to achieve success? To help answer <b>this,</b> <b>Bikes</b> Belong conducted a review of campaigns, primarily used in the U. S. Important conclusions include: Emotional campaigns are more effective at increasing safety than informational campaigns. Safety campaigns that personalize and humanize cyclists without creating fear are ideal. Messages should be targeted at wide audiences that include both motorists and cyclists...|$|R

Several hip-hop activists have also {{reflected}} on Johnson's legacy, {{most notably in}} the album The New Danger, by Mos Def, in which songs like [...] "Zimzallabim" [...] and [...] "Blue Black Jack" [...] are devoted to the artist's pugilistic hero. Additionally, both Southern punk rock band <b>This</b> <b>Bike</b> is a Pipe Bomb and alternative country performer Tom Russell have songs dedicated to Johnson. Russell's piece is both a tribute and a biting indictment of the racism Johnson faced: [...] "here comes Jack Johnson, like he owns the town, there's {{a lot of white}} Americans like to see a man go down... like to see a black man drown." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since 1992, the EMMS {{has been}} {{fundraising}} through bike rides in various countries. [...] The first bike ride that it sponsored {{took place in}} Israel with the Norwood Ravenswood Charity. [...] <b>This</b> <b>bike</b> ride took riders from Dan to Beersheba. [...] The EMMS believes that bike rides {{are one of the}} most opportune modes of fundraising because the participants can not only see the locations which will benefit from their fundraising, but also will have a [...] "real challenge [...] the mind and body and [...] an unforgettable spiritual experience." [...] The EMMS believes that supporters will see the value of their contributions by visiting these site locations and seeing the effect of their funding efforts. [...] The EMMS tells its potential visitors that the bike treks are not a [...] "holiday" [...] and are actually very challenging. [...] In addition to the bike rides, the EMMS suggests that anyone who wishes to donate can join a fundraiser that other organizations lead. [...] These [...] "open challenges" [...] come from organizations that the EMMS lists on its website that include Classic Tours, Discover Adventure, Travel2Give, and Different Travel.|$|E
2500|$|CDI {{triggered}} by {{two sets of}} points. A basic problem with the rotary engine design {{is a lack of}} engine braking, partially due to the mass of the rotor. Leaning of the mixture on overrun also contributes to erratic and [...] "lumpy" [...] running. One way to solve the problem is to shut off ignition entirely on overrun, but this leads to excessive contamination of the combustion chamber by unwanted deposits, which can cause the apex seals to stick. Suzuki opted for a compromise by using two sets of ignition points. One set of points ran on a dual lobe cam for normal operation, firing the rotor every face. The other set ran on a single cam on the same shaft for triggering the spark plug on overrun. The second set (the B points) were {{triggered by}} an rpm sensor (the speed relay) and a vacuum switch, which meant that they worked on engine deceleration (high vacuum) and above 1,700rpm. This system fired the rotor every second face. This kept the combustion chambers relatively clean. It also served to smooth the lumpy feel of the bike as RPM reduced on overrun and addressed some issues with backfiring (more correctly, [...] "afterfiring"). Engine braking is also significantly improved. The B point system was discontinued on the [...] "A". It is believed that the factory also employed mechanics to visit dealerships and disconnect the B points on any [...] "M" [...] (1975) models still in the showrooms. Suzuki {{toyed with the idea of}} two plugs like the Mazda's, but as with so much of their engineering on <b>this</b> <b>bike,</b> overthought the application, believing that they would require two plugs of different heat ranges. The idea was dropped, and the bike shipped with a single 18mm conical seat gold palladium spark plug housed in a copper insert in the rotor housing (NGK A9EFV).|$|E

5000|$|In 2003, {{the company}} {{introduced}} {{a major new}} design: the Townie. <b>This</b> <b>bike's</b> innovation was what the company calls [...] "Flat Foot Technology", now more widely known as the crank forward design. When the rider {{is sitting on the}} saddle, his or her feet can still stand flat on the ground, which feels safer and more comfortable for some riders. The design also allows riders to get full extension when they pedal. The design combines aspects of the cruiser frame with some of the geometry of recumbent bikes, moving the pedals forward and the seat back.|$|R
