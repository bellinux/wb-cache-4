5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows that if we have a perception that p, then even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> not be the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E
5|$|<b>Though</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> {{seem as if}} the Bible {{translation}} set a {{very powerful}} precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during {{the remainder of the}} century. It was not until the 17th century that spelling began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written. The spelling debate raged on until the early 19th century, and {{it was not until the}} latter half of the 19th century that the orthography reached generally acknowledged standards.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Potemkin's {{scheme to}} develop a Russian {{presence}} in the rapidly disintegrating state of Persia failed. Plans for a full-scale invasion had previously been cut back and a small unit sent to establish a trading post there was quickly turned away. Potemkin focused instead on Russia's southern provinces, where he was busy founding cities (including Sevastopol) and creating his own personal kingdom, including his brand new Black Sea Fleet. That kingdom was about to expand: under the Treaty of Kuçuk Kainarji, which had ended the previous Russo-Turkish war, the Crimean Khanate had become independent, though effectively under Russian control. In June 1782 it was descending again into anarchy. By July 1783, Potemkin had engineered the peaceful annexation of the Crimea and Kuban, capitalizing {{on the fact that}} Britain and France were fighting elsewhere. The Kingdom of Georgia accepted Russian protection a few days later with the Treaty of Georgievsk searching for protection against Persia's aim to reestablish its suzerainty over Georgia; the Karabakh Khanate of Persia initially looked as <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> also, but eventually declined Russian help. Exhausted, Potemkin collapsed into a fever he barely survived. Catherine rewarded him with one hundred thousand roubles, which he used to construct the Tauride Palace in St. Petersburg.|$|E

It was predicted this would be followed rapidly by a scaling to 100 Terabit, possibly as early as 2020.

25|$|After US courts merged law and equity, American law courts adopted {{many of the}} {{procedures}} of equity courts. The procedures {{in a court of}} equity were much more flexible than the courts at common law. In American practice, certain devices such as joinder, counterclaim, cross-claim and interpleader originated in the courts of equity. Also, the modern class action evolved out of the equitable doctrine of virtual representation, which enabled a court of equity to fully dispose of an estate even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> contain contingent interests held by persons over which the court did not have direct jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|Then {{comes the}} tens-column. The tens-column so far {{contains}} only one digit: the tens-digit of the multiplicand (<b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> contain a carry digit under the line). Find {{the product of}} the multiplier and the tens-digits of the multiplicand. Then, if there is a carry digit (superscripted, under the line and in the tens-column), add it to this product. If the resulting sum is less than ten then write it in the tens-column under the line. If the sum has two digits then write its last digit in the tens-column under the line, and carry its first digit over to the next column: in this case the hundreds column.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from serving}} as an official, Zhuge Zhan was also skilled in {{painting}} and calligraphy. Since the people of Shu deeply missed Zhuge Liang, who died in 234, they especially liked Zhuge Zhan for his talents because he reminded them of his father. Whenever the Shu government implemented a favourable policy, the people give credit to Zhuge Zhan even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have {{had nothing to do}} with him. As Zhuge Liang banned the position of official historian in the Shu government, it was hard to distinguish which policies Zhuge Zhan had a role in, although it was clear that Zhuge Zhan's reputation was greater than his actual accomplishments.|$|E
25|$|Some {{patients}} with anterograde amnesia can still acquire some semantic information, even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> {{be more difficult}} and might remain rather unrelated to more general knowledge. H.M. could accurately draw a floor plan of the home in which he lived after surgery, {{even though he had}} not lived there in years. The reason patients could not form new episodic memories is likely because the CA1 region of the hippocampus was lesion, and thus the hippocampus could not make connections to the cortex. After an ischemic episode following surgery, an MRI of patient R.B. showed his hippocampus to be intact except for a specific lesion restricted to the CA1 pyramidal cells.|$|E
25|$|As a girl, {{her last}} {{idea was to}} spend her life in India, even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be the Scudder family tradition. As a child in India, she saw all too much famine, poverty and disease. After a Massachusetts seminary, Ida {{expected}} {{to get married and}} settle down in the U.S., but, in her early 20s, Ida Scudder went back to India to help her ailing mother at her mission bungalow at Tindivanam. Ida Scudder took her M.D. at Cornell University in 1899, then headed back to India, fortified with a $10,000 gift from a Manhattan banker. With the money, she started a tiny clinic for women at Vellore, 75 miles from Madras. In two years she treated 5,000 patients.|$|E

25|$|On 1 February 1814, Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher with 80,000 Allied {{troops from}} his own Army of Silesia and Austrian Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia {{defeated}} Napoleon and 45,000 French soldiers in the Battle of La Rothière. This setback seriously shook the French army's morale. Each side suffered about 6,000 casualties but the Allied captured 50–60 artillery pieces. The Allies were delighted by their victory, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been more complete if all their reserves had been committed to the battle. At this time, the Allied generals made the questionable decision to separate their armies. Blücher's army would advance from Châlons-sur-Marne toward Meaux while Schwarzenberg's army operated on a more southerly route from Troyes toward Paris.|$|E
25|$|There {{are quite}} a few drug therapies that are {{possible}} for Parkinson's disease (ex. Sinemet). Since there is no cure for it, the patient will probably end up having to have surgery done to relieve some of the symptoms. When a patient has this procedure done, they are most likely going to receive a deep brain stimulation. So it will keep the brain stimulated even though the disease tries to disable it. Recently a study was performed to test if surgery helps the patients discover their symptoms post surgery than pre-surgery. They found that the symptoms were still present but the patients were more aware of their difficulties than before they had surgery. This shows that surgery does improve a patients speech perception, even <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> not cure their disease.|$|E
25|$|Information on Kliper's beyond LEO mission {{capabilities}} were expanded {{further by}} RSC Energia, {{with a picture}} released in December 2005 of what a possible Kliper interplanetary configuration might have looked like. The design was entirely theoretical but made for a view of where RSC Energia saw the Kliper operating, and how it might have done so. This configuration was unlike anything seen so far for a manned space vehicle, with the solar arrays needed for electrical power vastly bigger than the habitable volume at the centre. It was also unclear what the mode of propulsion was. The very large solar array suggested an ion propulsion system might have been contemplated for such a mission, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> also simply be {{that there was another}} reason for such a large array, such as increased power for better telemetry transmission rates over large distances.|$|E

25|$|Typically, {{at least}} half the prey biomass is made up from small rodents from the Cricetidae (voles, lemmings) and Murinae (Eurasian mice and {{sometimes}} young Eurasian rats). Shrews, songbirds, lizards, and frogs and toads (typically as tadpoles) make up most of the remaining vertebrate prey. Birds are generally of little importance however, except in spring when male songbirds are engaged in courtship display and often rather oblivious of their surroundings, in late summer when inexperienced fledglings abound, and in winter when most small mammals hibernate. Occasionally bats, newts and salamanders, and even fish are eaten. Prey animals may exceptionally be almost as large as the birds themselves, for example chicks of the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) or a young stoat. Large arthropods are the second-most important prey by quantity, though not by biomass; in the latter respect they are only a bit more important than birds, except as food for nestlings where they usually form a substantial part of the diet. Most important among invertebrate prey are insects, especially beetles, crickets and grasshoppers, and bumblebees and wasps. Invertebrate prey of minor importance are spiders and scorpions, crayfish and isopods, snails, and oligochaete worms. Carrion and berries are rarely if ever eaten; <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> occasionally plunder songbird nests this is not well documented and it is not known to eat eggs.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Sea Change, Beck felt newer {{compositions}} were sketches for something more evolved in the same direction, and wrote nearly 35 more songs in the coming months, keeping demos of them on tapes in a suitcase. During his solo tour, the tapes were left backstage during a stop in Washington, D.C., and Beck {{was never able to}} recover them. It was disheartening to the musician, who felt the two years of songwriting represented something more technically complex. As a result, Beck took a break and wrote no original compositions in 2003.
