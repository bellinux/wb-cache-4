Other statistics from {{around the same time}} include Photobucket going from twenty percent of market share to only three percent, Myspace going from twelve percent market share to less than one percent, and ESPN from eight percent to four percent market share. In terms of images, Photobucket went from 31% in 2007 to 10% in 2010 and Yahoo Images has gone from 12% to 7%. It becomes apparent that the decline of these companies has come because of Google's increase in market share from 43% in 2007 to about 55% in 2009.|$|R

Developing transport networks will facilitate the cooperation interregional and will contribute significantly to increase competitiveness of enterprises/firms and the labour mobility, and, therefore, a development faster to Romania on the whole, but also of each region. The development of urban transport network will take into account the existing structure of public transportation to ensure where possible, improve the infrastructure of roads, which will contribute to use in a more efficient way of public transportation.

50|$|As of January 2005, BitTorrent traffic made up {{more than}} a third of total {{residential}} internet traffic, although this dropped to less than 20% as of 2009. Some ISPs deal with this traffic by increasing their capacity whilst others use specialised systems to slow peer-to-peer <b>traffic</b> to <b>cut</b> costs. Obfuscation and encryption make traffic harder to detect and therefore harder to throttle. These systems were designed initially to provide anonymity or confidentiality, but became required in countries where Internet Service Providers were granted the power to throttle BitTorrent users and even ban those they believed were guilty of illegal file sharing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of cyber video consultation systems(CVCS) using hybrid P 2 P for video consultation between remote sites. The proposed system is based on client-server and P 2 P(Peer to Peer) architecture, where client-server is used for communication with the MCU(Multipoint Control Unit) and P 2 P {{is used for the}} cyber video consultation. The developed video consultation system decreases server <b>traffic,</b> and <b>cuts</b> down network expenses, as the multimedia data decentralizes to the client by hybrid P 2 P architecture.

50|$|Gordon {{differed}} {{with the}} British government's decision {{to abandon the}} Sudan. He thought that the Islamic revolt had to be crushed for fear that it might eventually overwhelm Egypt. He based this on the Mahdi’s claim of dominion over all Islamic lands. Defying orders from the British government to withdraw, General Gordon, leading a garrison of 6,000 men, began the defence of Khartoum. On March 18, 1884, the Mahdist army laid siege to the city. The rebels stopped river <b>traffic</b> and <b>cut</b> the telegraph line to Cairo. Khartoum was cut off from resupply, which led to food shortages, but could still communicate {{with the outside world}} by using messengers. Under pressure from the public, in August 1884, the British government decided to reverse its policy and send a relief force to Khartoum.|$|R

The following year, Portland police reported an overall increase in traffic citations was mostly due to photo radar in the Terwilliger curves, issuing more than 5,400 citations from November 1995 to October 1996.

50|$|Into the 20th century, the {{diminishing}} {{importance of the}} Chicago & Northwestern Railroad line through Manchester slowed train <b>traffic</b> and <b>cut</b> into the town's expansion, causing many to leave the town. This slide continued into the Great Depression as the line lay idle and more residents were forced to close their businesses and move elsewhere to find work. Despite road contact finally being made through Manchester in the late 1930s, little remained to induce people to linger and the few remaining residents began to die off or move away, with many relocating to nearby De Smet or Huron. Having lost many of its residents and its primary means of attracting more, Manchester's population steadily dwindled until a core population {{of no more than}} 100 residents remained, with most operating farms and ranches outside the town limits. The CNW railroad officially announced its permanent abandonment of the railroad line in 1986 and stopped maintaining the tracks. By 2003, less than a dozen structures (including two operating businesses) remained standing on the original Manchester town plot along US-14 and 425th Avenue.|$|R

Another bypass (the A4063) was built to bypass Bridgend Road to take valleys traffic for to Bridgend out of the village. This second bypass cut Heol Persondy in two, which was the road from Aberkenfig to Sarn, and reduced it to a footpath.

The river was a key route from the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea to central Russia. Its capture would disrupt commercial river <b>traffic.</b> The Germans <b>cut</b> the pipeline from the oilfields when they captured Rostov on 23 July.
