5|$|In 1925, Maeda became {{involved}} with helping settle Japanese immigrants near Tome-açú, a Japanese-owned company town in Pará, Brazil. This {{was part of a}} large tract in the Amazon forest set aside for Japanese settlement by the Brazilian government. The crops grown by the Japanese were not popular with the Brazilians, and the Japanese investors eventually gave up on the project. Maeda also continued teaching judo, now mostly to the children of Japanese immigrants. Consequently, in 1929, the Kodokan promoted him to 6th dan, and on November 27, 1941, to 7th dan. Maeda never knew of this final promotion, because he died in Belém on November 28, 1941. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> kidney disease.|$|E
40|$|Identification <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> was <b>the</b> {{topic of}} the Town Hall {{discussion}} at the STP Annual Symposium in 2003 (The Scope).

5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Cabell's Dale in early 1806 and fell ill in June. In July, he visited Kentucky's Olympian Springs, {{hoping it would}} aid his recovery, but it did not. Doctors disagreed on {{the cause of his}} illness, with diagnoses ranging from typhus fever to stomach ailments. He attempted to return to Washington, D.C., on October 22, but while his horse was being prepared for the journey, he collapsed in pain and had to be helped back inside. Friends and relatives hoped for a recovery that never came, and he died on December 14, 1806. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> eventually determined to be tuberculosis. According to family tradition, Polly Breckinridge was so distraught over her husband's death that she went blind from her incessant crying. Breckinridge was first buried at Cabell's Dale on December 16 but was later reinterred in Lexington Cemetery.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objectives The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} if differences in clinical diagnosis versus autopsy findings concerning <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in polytrauma fatalities would be detected in 19 cases of fatal polytrauma from a Level 1 trauma centre. Methods Clinical diagnoses determining <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in 19 cases of fatal polytrauma (2007 - 2008) from a Level 1 trauma centre were correlated with autopsy findings. Results In 13 cases (68 %), <b>the</b> clinical <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> and <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> as determined by autopsy were congruent. Marginal differences occurred in three (16 %) patients while obvious differences in interpreting <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> were found in another three (16 %) cases. Five fatalities (three with obvious differences and two with marginal differences) were remarked as early death (1 - 4 h after trauma) and one fatality with marginal differences as late death (> 1 week after trauma). Obvious and marginal discrepancies mostly occurred in the early phase of treatment, especially when severely injured patients were admitted to the emergency room undergoing continued cardiopulmonary resuscitation, i. e. limiting diagnostic procedures, and thus <b>the</b> clinical <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> was essentially determined by basic emergency diagnostics. Conclusions Autopsy as golden standard to define <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> in fatal polytrauma varies from the clinical point of view, depending on the patient's pre-existing condition, mechanism of polytrauma, necessity of traumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation, survival time, and thus the possibility to perform emergency diagnostics. An autopsy should be performed at least in cases of early fatal polytrauma to help establishing <b>the</b> definite <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death.</b> Moreover, autopsy data should be included in trauma registries as a quality assessment tool. </p...|$|R

5|$|Chris Candido was an American {{professional}} wrestler who wrestled for TNA {{starting in}} 2005. At TNA's Lockdown PPV event on April24, 2005, Candido teamed with Lance Hoyt to face Apolo and Sonny Siaki in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match. During the encounter, Candido suffered an injury which was later diagnosed as a dislocated ankle, broken tibia, {{and a broken}} fibula which required surgery. Candido had an operation on April25 to have a plate, screws, and pins placed in his ankle {{to fix the problem}} with him being sidelined from competing for two to three months in order to heal. However, Candido hoped to be fully recovered in six to eight weeks. On April28, Candido {{was rushed to the hospital}} after he collapsed, where he died a short time later. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> released by Candido's brother Johnny as a blood clot due to the surgery a few days prior.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 he {{embarked}} upon {{a series}} of drawings and watercolours of Hyde Park, which were due to be exhibited in London. Hunter hoped {{to move to the}} city permanently, as he found it livelier than Glasgow and the art market was more secure. However, his health deteriorated and he began to suffer badly from stomach pains. He died in Glasgow in the Claremont Nursing Home on 7 December 1931, aged 54. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> cardiac failure due to blood poisoning, following an unsuccessful gall bladder operation. A member of Glasgow Art Club, work by Hunter was included in the club's Memorial Exhibition of 1935, in memory of those of its members who had died since the First World War.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the {{conclusion}} of spring practice, a pair of tragedies occurred that directly impacted the team. On April 27, 2011, an EF4 rated tornado devastated Tuscaloosa. As {{a result of the}} storm, long snapper Carson Tinker suffered a broken wrist with his girlfriend being one of the 43 fatalities attributed to the storm in Tuscaloosa. On May 12, 2011, offensive lineman Aaron Douglas was found dead in Fernandina Beach, Florida. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> subsequently ruled accidental as a result of multiple drug toxicity. After transferring to Alabama from Arizona Western College, Douglas struggled with off-field issues including a DUI charge following a December 2010 arrest.

5|$|Lace was {{released}} from Dartmoor in July 1987 and settled in nearby Brixham, Devon, returning to visit family in Portsmouth in 1988. He intimated that he was depressed about his past actions and in December 1988 gave away his possessions and resigned from his job. He was last seen by friends between 7–8 December and was found dead by his landlord on 9December. Postmortem examination revealed superficial wounds to his wrist, ingestion of analgesics and a plastic bag over his head. <b>The</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> determined to be asphyxiation and his death was determined as suicide by the coroner. Lace was buried in Kingston Cemetery, Portsmouth on 20December 1988. After a cross check on the DNA database found that the DNA from the murder scene showed a partial match {{with that of a}} relative of Lace, detectives requested a sample from Andrina Foster, Lace's biological sister, which gave a familial match with the murderer's DNA. As a result of this development, Lace's body was exhumed on 12 August 2009 for DNA testing as part of Operation Iceberg.|$|E

Shashi Tharoor {{discovered}} her body, when she did not wake up from her sleep in the evening. He informed the Delhi Police, who recovered the body from the hotel and sent it for postmortem. According to initial reports, Sunanda was suspected to have committed suicide. Later reports stated that <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> unnatural; the doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences gave a preliminary autopsy report that revealed injury marks on her body. They said that these injuries {{may or may not be}} the cause of death. The autopsy indicated that she died of drug overdose, most likely a combination of sedatives, other strong medicines and probably alcohol. An investigation has been ordered by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate to examine the cause of poisoning and to ascertain if it was murder or suicide. Her body was cremated at Lodhi Crematorium in South Delhi.|$|E
5|$|Palomeque {{was found}} dead on August 22, 2009. His {{body was found in}} a river near the town of El Rosario, Sinaloa. According to a bus driver who was {{transporting}} Palomeque and other passengers to Mexico City on Friday night August 20, Palomeque became agitated, panicked and demanded to be let off the bus despite it being 1:30 in the morning. A text message he sent to his wife after leaving the bus confirms that Palomeque found himself lost on the dark hillside. After receiving the text message, his wife contacted local wrestling promoter Vicente Martinez, who organized a search party. On the morning of August 22, Palomeque was found floating face down in the river. Afterwards, medical expert Jesús Enrique Castro López stated that such an anxiety attack could be steroid related, but Palomeque's alleged steroid abuse has not been confirmed. An autopsy was carried out on August 23, which determined that <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>death</b> <b>was</b> drowning, and no further investigation into the death is planned. A memorial was held in Mexico City on August 24 for friends and family of Palomeque, many of whom showed up without their masks on, to keep the focus of the event on Palomeque. His body was subsequently cremated, with the ashes taken to Villahermosa to be buried.|$|E
