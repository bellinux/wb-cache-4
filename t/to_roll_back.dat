After his past experiences Heraclius had been avoiding pitched battles with the Muslims. He planned to isolate the Muslim corps from each other, and separately encircle and destroy the Muslim armies. Five massive armies were launched in Syria from different routes in June 636 to recapture it.|$|E

5|$|During his {{successful}} {{campaign for the}} U.S. presidency, Dwight Eisenhower pledged to pursue a more proactive anti-communist policy, promising <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> communism, rather than contain it. Working {{in an atmosphere of}} increasing McCarthyism in government circles, Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use the CIA to depose governments the U.S. disliked. Although PBFORTUNE had been quickly aborted, tension between the U.S. and Guatemala continued to rise, especially with the legalization of the communist PGT, and its inclusion in the government coalition for the elections of January 1953. Articles published in the U.S. press often reflected this predisposition to see communist influence; for example, a New York Times article about the visit to Guatemala by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda highlighted his communist beliefs, but neglected to mention his reputation as the greatest living poet in Latin America.|$|E

5|$|Operation Leap2 {{began on}} 4 June with {{the advance of}} the HV 4thGuards Brigade. HVO troops took Crni Lug and the {{mountain}} pass en route to Bosansko Grahovo, the operation's chief objective. Its left flank, in the border area, was protected by the 3rdBattalion of the 126thHome Guard Regiment and the Tactical Sniper Company attached to the HV Split Corps. The VRS counterattacked on 6–7 June, trying <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> the 4thGuards Brigade. The VRS push failed, as did its efforts to contain the advance with close air support and M-87 Orkan rockets. On 6 June (the same day as the VRS counterattack), {{the second phase of}} Operation Leap2 began. The 1stBattalion of the 1stGuards Brigade supported by the HV 264th Reconnaissance Sabotage Company and elements of the HV 1st HGZ advanced north from Livno, capturing the high ground near Glamoč and blocking the Bosansko Grahovo-Glamoč road by 10 June. To pin down the VRS on the right flank of the attack, the HVO 2nd Guards Brigade attacked VRS positions on Golija Mountain south-west of Glamoč.|$|E
5|$|Marshall's {{opponent}} {{in the general election}} was Republican Congressman James E. Watson, and the campaign focused on temperance and prohibition. Just as it began, the Republican-controlled state government passed a local-option law that allowed counties to ban the sale of liquor. The law became the central point of debate between the parties and their gubernatorial candidates. The Democrats proposed that the local-option law be changed so that the decision to ban liquor sales could be made at the city and township level. This drew support from anti-prohibitionists, who saw it as an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> prohibition in some areas, and as the only alternative available to the total prohibition which the Republican Party advocated. The Democratic position also helped to retain prohibitionists' support by allowing prohibition to remain enacted in communities where a majority supported it. The Republican Party {{was in the midst of}} a period of instability, splitting along progressive and conservative lines. Their internal problems proved to be the deciding factor in the election, giving Marshall a narrow victory: he received 48.1 percent of the vote to Watson's 48 percent. He was the first Democratic governor in two decades. Democrats also came to power in the Indiana House of Representatives by a small margin, though Republicans retained control of the Indiana Senate.|$|E

Though Hoover had opposed FDR's concentration of power in the 1930s, he believed that a stronger presidency was required with the advent of Atomic Age. In 1953, Hoover was appointed to a similar commission by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Despite the appointment, Hoover disliked Eisenhower, faulting the latter's failure <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> the New Deal.|$|E

Following through on a campaign promise, Pataki led a push to cut both the individual and the corporate tax rates in New York. New York's infamously high income tax rate dropped by 20% on average, but an economic downturn following the attacks of September 11 and increasing state spending caused Sheldon Silver and Joseph Bruno to coordinate an effort <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> a number of these cuts in 2003 over Pataki's veto power.|$|E

25|$|For 15 years, Wayne Schmuck of Harvard, Illinois, {{owner of}} Big Foot Auto Sales, had sold used cars {{he had bought}} in his state, where vehicle titles did not then require a {{statement}} on {{the title of the}} odometer reading {{at the time of the}} transaction, to dealers in Wisconsin, which did. Unbeknownst to the dealers, he had in some cases hired someone <b>to</b> <b>roll</b> <b>back</b> the odometers on them, making the vehicles appear to have less mileage than they actually did. Thus they commanded an artificially higher price, both when the dealer paid Schmuck and when they sold it to a customer. In order for the retail transaction to take place, the dealers needed to mail a title application, including the falsified odometer reading, to the state Department of Transportation.|$|E

Bork's nomination was defeated in the Senate, with 58 of the 100 Senators opposing his nomination. The Supreme Court vacancy was instead filled by another Reagan nominee, Anthony Kennedy. Bork resigned his judgeship in 1988 and served as a professor at the George Mason University School of Law and other institutions.

40|$|Over {{the years}} several locking {{protocols}} {{have been proposed}} for coordinating the concurrent use of a data base by multiple transactions. Of these, the non-two-phase locking (non- 2 PL) protocols form a large class. The Pitfall Protocol (PP) {{is one of the}} non- 2 PL protocols. While the rules of PP assure serializability, they do not prevent deadlocks from occurring. Resolution of a deadlock by partially/fully undoing (i. e. rolling back) the actions of one of the transactions involved in the deadlock may result in two undesirable consequences: a) cascading rollbacks [...] more than one transaction may have <b>to</b> be <b>rolled</b> <b>back,</b> b) rollback of completed transaction [...] a transaction that has terminated could be required <b>to</b> be <b>rolled</b> <b>back.</b> Thus a complex commit protocol may be necessary to determine whether a transaction may be allowed to commit. It is the goal of this paper to introduce a simple additional condition to the rules of PP that will allow very simple handling of deadlocks by partial rollbacks, without causing the above undesirable effects. 1...|$|R
