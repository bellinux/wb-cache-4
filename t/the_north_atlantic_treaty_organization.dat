5|$|Large-scale {{construction}} of airports in Norway {{started in the}} 1950s, largely funded by <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>Organization</b> (NATO). Bergen Airport, Flesland opened in 1955, followed by Ålesund Airport, Vigra in 1958. The first plans for an airport in Sunnfjord were launched by Engineer Arne Bengtsen, who proposed building an airfield in Florø and having Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap operate to it using the Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneer. Construction started in 1956, but was halted after the airline could not guarantee operations during winter.|$|E
5|$|The book {{explains}} the covert {{groups within the}} Soviet Union tasked with disrupting government activities of the countries belonging to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>Organization,</b> and the U.S., through injection of Communist propaganda. The authors place the Soviet policy of active measures within a broader strategy of Russian military deception in favor of domestic national security. They focus their discussion on disinformation conducted by the Soviet intelligence between the period of 1960–1980.|$|E
5|$|After the {{experience}} of World War II, Belgium abandoned its neutral stance in international politics, in favour of military, political and economic integration. In 1949, Belgium joined <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>Organization</b> and deployed troops to fight alongside other United Nations forces in the Korean War in 1950. Belgium was also {{a key player in}} the unsuccessful negotiations about the creation of a European Defence Community (EDC) in the 1950s. Belgium was assigned a sector of the British zone in West Germany, around the city of Cologne, which it occupied from 1945.

5|$|Interest in Banak {{rose with}} the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 {{and fears of}} Soviet {{intervention}} in Norway. Finnmark, located on the Norway–Soviet Union border, became of particular interest for the military. Although specific plans were articulated, no construction of an airbase was carried out. However, Norway's entry into <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>Organization</b> (NATO) in 1949 had a dramatic effect on the military strategy and Banak. Finnmark {{was regarded as a}} tripwire and was to be sacrificed in case of a Soviet invasion. The airfield was closed in 1952, but the runway remained, consisting of a short section of unmaintained wooden runway and the rest a grass strip. It was occasionally used by small aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Shultz and Godson discuss Soviet {{disinformation}} tactics including {{injection of}} Communist propaganda through covert {{groups within the}} U.S.S.R. tasked with disrupting activities of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>Organization</b> and the U.S. The book explains disinformation methods including forgery as covert operation, agents of influence, and using social influence to turn targets into useful idiots. They focus on disinformation activities of Soviet intelligence from 1960 to 1980. Shultz and Godson discuss case studies as examples of Soviet disinformation, including a French journalist covertly financed by Russian agents in order to publish biased material against Western interests, and the front organization activities of the World Peace Council. They back up their analyses with two Soviet intelligence defectors.|$|E
5|$|The {{airfield}} {{was constructed}} with triangular runways in 1938. It {{was taken over}} by the Luftwaffe in 1940, who expanded it and laid down two wooden runways. It {{was taken over by}} the NoRAF in 1945, but abandoned in 1952. It opened in 1963 and was largely funded by <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>Organization</b> (NATO). Scandinavian Airlines operated out of the airport to the other primary airports in Finnmark and to Tromsø and Oslo. The runway was extended in 1968. From 1990, flights were taken over by SAS Commuter and the direct flights to Oslo were halted. From the mid-1990s there have been occasional charter flights out of Banak. Widerøe took over SAS' services in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The {{airfield}} {{was first}} built with triangular runways in 1938. It {{was taken over}} by the Luftwaffe in 1940, who expanded it and laid down two wooden runways. Banak {{was taken over by}} the RNoAF in 1945, but abandoned in 1952. Plans for re-opening emerged in 1955, but uncertainty regarding its value in a war caused a prolonged debate about financing. The air station was largely funded by <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>Organization</b> (NATO) and was opened on 4 May 1963, along with a civilian terminal. During the Cold War, Norway did not allow allies peacetime use of the airfield. The runway was extended in 1968 and the 330 Squadron was established in 1973.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle East {{and eastern}} Mediterranean, two ongoing {{international}} disputes developed into crises. The Cyprus dispute {{turned into a}} crisis with the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, causing extreme strain within <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>Organization</b> (NATO) alliance. In mid-August, the Greek government withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September 1974, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford, concerned with both {{the effect of this}} on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill. A second bill was then passed by Congress, which Ford also vetoed, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid {{until the end of the}} year. As Ford expected, Turkish relations were considerably disrupted until 1978.|$|E
5|$|Truman was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>Organization</b> (NATO), which established a formal peacetime military alliance with Canada and democratic European nations that had not fallen under Soviet control following World War II. The treaty establishing it was widely popular and easily passed the Senate in 1949; Truman appointed General Eisenhower as commander. NATO's goals were to contain Soviet expansion in Europe and to send a clear message to communist leaders that the world's democracies were willing and able to build new security structures in support of democratic ideals. The U.S., Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Iceland, and Canada were the original treaty signatories. The alliance resulted in the Soviets establishing a similar alliance, called the Warsaw Pact.|$|E

5|$|Following his defeat, Cooper resumed the {{practice}} of law in the Washington, D.C. firm of Gardner, Morison and Rogers. In 1949, President Truman appointed Cooper as one of five delegates to the United Nations (U.N.) General Assembly. He was an alternate delegate to that body in 1950 and 1951. Secretary of State Dean Acheson chose Cooper as his advisor to meetings that created <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>Organization</b> (NATO) and at meetings of the NATO Council of Ministers in London in May 1950 and Brussels in December 1950. Political historian Glenn Finch observed that, while Cooper was well-qualified for his duties at the U.N. and NATO, his presence abroad also made him less available to campaign for the Senate seat vacated by Barkley's elevation to the vice-presidency. Speculation was raised that Clements, who won Barkley's old seat in a special election in 1950, may have influenced Truman and Acheson to make the appointments.|$|E
5|$|During {{his first}} term in the Senate, Cooper voted with the {{majority}} of his party just 51% of the time. He was defeated in his re-election bid in 1948, after which he accepted an appointment by President Harry S. Truman as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly and served as a special assistant to Secretary of State Dean Acheson during the formation of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Treaty</b> <b>Organization</b> (NATO). Cooper was again elected to a partial term in the Senate in 1952. The popular Cooper appeared likely to be re-elected in 1954 until the Democrats nominated former Vice-President Alben W. Barkley. Cooper lost the general election and was appointed Ambassador to India by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1955. Cooper gained the confidence of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and dramatically improved relations between the U.S. and the recently independent state of India, helping rebuff Soviet hopes of expanding communism in Asia. Barkley died in 1956, and Eisenhower requested that Cooper seek Barkley's open seat. Cooper reluctantly acquiesced and was elected to serve the rest of Barkley's term.|$|E
