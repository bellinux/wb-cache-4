5|$|At {{the ends}} of the linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from <b>treating</b> <b>them</b> as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E

5|$|Atangana {{won over}} other chiefs and headmen through gifts, tax cuts, flattery, and {{intervention}} on their behalf. He lavished attention on visitors {{from out of}} town, letting them stay at his palace and use his horses, and <b>treating</b> <b>them</b> to feasts. In addition to flattering them, this allowed him to monitor their activities and dealings with the colonial authorities. His clerk appointees in Jaunde informed him of the doings of both the Germans and his subjects. Atangana gained {{a substantial amount of}} wealth. He owned workshops and sold produce from five plantations to provision impressed railway construction workers.|$|E
5|$|Aymer Vallance was {{commissioned}} {{to produce the}} first biography of Morris, published in 1897, after Morris' death, as per the latter's wishes. This presented the creation of SPAB as Morris' greatest achievement. Morris's next biographer was Burne-Jones' son-in-law John William Mackail, who authored the two-volume Life of William Morris (1899) in which he provided a sympathetic portrayal of Morris that largely omitted his political activities, <b>treating</b> <b>them</b> as a passing phase that Morris overcame.|$|E
5|$|Frank Case, {{owner of}} the hotel, ensured a daily luncheon for the talented group of young writers by <b>treating</b> <b>them</b> to free celery and popovers; more importantly, they were {{provided}} with their own table and waiter. Edna Ferber, Franklin P. Adams, George S. Kaufman, Heywood Broun, and Marc Connelly eventually joined the group, expanding its membership. All members were affiliated with the Algonquin Round Table, although they referred to themselves as the Vicious Circle.|$|E

5|$|In 2017, the Series again drew criticism, {{this time}} for {{allowing}} games to be called early because of weather and <b>treating</b> <b>them</b> as official games. After the Yokohama BayStars lost a 5-inning game in the 2017 Central League Climax Series, Coskrey wrote that playoff games should never end like in that manner. He suggested that NPB could have easily suspended the game and resumed where it left off {{the next day or}} even postponed the game entirely until the next day.|$|E
5|$|At the mall, Michael {{opens to}} the women about his {{discomfort}} with Jan. Among other things, he tells them Jan has been videotaping them having sex and watching it with him afterwards. All the women assure Michael that Jan's behavior is not normal and urge {{him to get out}} of the relationship. He remains conflicted about what he should do about Jan, but at Phyllis's prompting he finally admits to himself that he wants to break up with her. Michael thanks them for their help by <b>treating</b> <b>them</b> to one item each at Victoria's Secret. On the drive back, Pam takes a step toward asserting herself by changing a flat tire on Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) car.

When Lisa asks Homer if they can go hiking the Sunday following the Super Bowl, he tells her that Daddy-Daughter Days are over until next football season. Lisa realizes that all Homer wanted was to exploit her prognostic abilities to help him gamble. Completely heartbroken, Lisa gives away all the toys Homer bought for her.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and <b>treating</b> <b>them</b> differently. Von Neumann stated that a class is too big to be a set {{if it can be}} put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E
5|$|The doctor tells Scully that Emily {{is getting}} worse. A {{woman from the}} {{adoption}} agency arrives and wants to stop Scully from making decisions for Emily. Mulder connects {{the names of the}} women in the nursing home to recent births and finds that Dr. Calderon was <b>treating</b> <b>them.</b> Emily reacts badly to being placed in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Mulder finds medical records with Scully's name on them at the nursing home, along with a live fetus in a refrigerated chamber. Mulder finds Calderon entering soon after, and Detective Kresge arrives as well. Mulder and Kresge confront Calderon, who attacks Kresge. Despite Mulder's warning Kresge shoots Calderon, whose wounds cause him to spew green blood which incapacitates Kresge. Mulder quickly leaves the building to avoid being affected by the blood. Calderon morphs into Kresge, and deceives Mulder and escapes. Mulder returns to the hospital, where Emily has gone into a coma. Days later Emily has died. Mulder visits Scully at the funeral chapel, telling her that Kresge is recovering and all evidence at the nursing home and Prangen is gone. The only evidence left is Emily's body, but the agents instead find sand bags in her coffin along with Scully's cross necklace, which she had previously given to Emily.|$|E

At the time most of the public hospitals would report the wounded revolutionaries to SAVAK but Dr. Sapir's hospital was the only hospital that was <b>treating</b> <b>them</b> without informing the SAVAK agents. Dr. Sapir hospital's actions were so instrumental that Ayatollah Khomeini himself wrote a personal note thanking the hospital for its help after the revolution succeeded.|$|E

25|$|Emanuel co-wrote, The {{complete}} lives system discriminates against older people. Age-based allocation is ageism.

Even if 25-year-olds receive priority over 65-year-olds, everyone who is 65 years now was previously 25 years. Treating 65-year-olds differently because of stereotypes or falsehoods would be ageist; <b>treating</b> <b>them</b> differently because they have already had more life-years is not.|$|E
