25|$|Divers {{working in}} cold water, {{particularly}} when breathing helium based gases, which increase <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> transfer, may rapidly lose body heat and suffer from hypothermia, which is unhealthy, and reduces diver effectiveness. This is can be ameliorated {{with a hot}} water system. A diver hot water system heats filtered seawater and pumps it to the divers through the bell and diver umbilicals. This water is used to heat the breathing gas before it is inhaled, and flows through the diver's exposure suit to keep the diver warm.|$|E

In an adiabatic process, where the proper mass remains constant, it is the heat content, and not the energy, which is conserved because the pressure, and not the volume, is Lorentz-invariant. There are two categories of relativistic quantities: inertial and thermodynamic ones, which are transformed into one another by the work necessary to keep the inertial state in motion. In a non-adiabatic process, <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> is Lorentz-invariant, which must always be greater than the power that it generates...|$|R

The 500 -mm long tapered fins were each 1 Â· 6 mm at their tips and 4 Â· 4 mm thick at their base, and protruded 60 mm perpendicularly outwards from their 500 mm x 190 mm rectangular base.

25|$|One must {{be careful}} when {{measuring}} temperature {{to ensure that the}} measuring instrument (thermometer, thermocouple, etc.) is really the same temperature as the material that is being measured. Under some conditions heat from the measuring instrument can cause a temperature gradient, so the measured temperature is different from the actual temperature of the system. In such a case the measured temperature will vary not only with the temperature of the system, but also with the heat transfer properties of the system. An extreme case of this effect gives rise to the wind chill factor, where the weather feels colder under windy conditions than calm conditions even though the temperature is the same. What is happening is that the wind increases <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> transfer from the body, resulting in a larger reduction in body temperature for the same ambient temperature.|$|E
25|$|The common ostrich has {{no sweat}} glands, and under heat stress {{they rely on}} panting to reduce their body temperature. Panting {{increases}} evaporative heat (and water) loss from its respiratory surfaces, therefore forcing air and heat removal without the loss of metabolic salts. Panting allows the common ostrich {{to have a very}} effective respiratory evaporative water loss (REWL). Heat dissipated by respiratory evaporation increases linearly with ambient temperature, matching <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> production. As a result of panting the common ostrich should eventually experience alkalosis. However, The CO2 concentration in the blood does not change when hot ambient temperatures are experienced. This effect is caused by a lung surface shunt. The lung is not completely shunted, allowing enough oxygen to fulfill the bird’s metabolic needs. The common ostrich utilizes gular fluttering, rapid rhythmic contraction and relaxation of throat muscles, in a similar way to panting. Both these behaviors allow the ostrich to actively increase the rate of evaporative cooling.|$|E

5000|$|If one <b>heats</b> a pot <b>of</b> soup on {{the stove}} the pot will develop a {{temperature}} gradient, (warmest {{on the bottom and}} cooler at the surface).

Even more significant, agitation disturbs the soup directly in contact with the hotter pot surface. Highly turbulent flow at the warming surface is important to good heat transfer. This is the same effect as the [...] "wind chill" [...] factor where moving air and turbulent action on surfaces (like those on people) resulting in significantly enhanced heat transfer.

2500|$|Thermoception is {{the sense}} of heat and the absence of heat (cold) by the skin and {{internal}} skin passages, or, rather, the heat flux (<b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> flow) in these areas. There are specialized receptors for cold (declining temperature) and for heat (increasing temperature). The cold receptors play an important part in the animal's sense of smell, telling wind direction. [...] The heat receptors are sensitive to infrared radiation and can occur in specialized organs, for instance in pit vipers. The thermoceptors in the skin are quite different from the homeostatic thermoceptors in the brain (hypothalamus), which provide feedback on internal body temperature.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} of a wetsuit, the suit is {{designed}} to minimise heat loss. Wetsuits are usually made of foamed neoprene that has small closed bubbles, generally containing nitrogen, trapped in it during the manufacturing process. The poor thermal conductivity of this expanded cell neoprene means that wetsuits reduce loss of body heat by conduction to the surrounding water. The neoprene, and to a larger extent the nitrogen gas, function as an insulator. The effectiveness of the insulation is reduced when the suit is compressed due to depth, as the nitrogen filled bubbles are then smaller and the compressed gas conducts heat better. The second way in which wetsuits can reduce heat loss is to trap the water which leaks into the suit. Body heat then heats the trapped water, and provided the suit is reasonably well-sealed at all openings (neck, wrists, ankles, zippers and overlaps with other suit components), this water remains inside the suit and is not replaced by more cold water, which would also take up body heat, and this helps reduce <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> loss. This principle is applied in the [...] "Semi-Dry" [...] wetsuit.|$|E

A temperature-regulated oedometer refurbished {{as part of this}} study was used to measure thermally induced volume changes. It was found that <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>heating</b> <b>rates</b> on <b>the</b> thermally induced volume change in soils lies in the difference between the drained and undrained behavior of soils. When a soil is heated in undrained conditions, the particles and water will expand at <b>the</b> same <b>rate</b> as <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>heating.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion of the soil particles and the water during heating will result in the generation of excess pore water pressures. If drainage is allowed to occur, these excess pore water pressures will dissipate, leading to a time-dependent consolidation of the soil.
