A manikin model was used with an artificial first molar in which an MO-preparation was ground, simulating the clinical situation of an amalgam replacement. This preparation was duplicated, resulting in 160 identically prepared teeth. These teeth were divided into 8 groups (n= 20). In 2 groups, circumferential matrix bands (flat or contoured) in a Tofflemire retainer were applied. In the remaining 6 groups, 3 different separation rings were combined with 2 types of sectional matrix bands. All the cavities were restored using Clearfil Photo Bond and Clearfil AP-X. The tightness of the proximal contact was measured using the <b>Tooth</b> <b>Pressure</b> Meter. Data were statistically analyzed using SPSS 12. ANOVA was used to find differences in proximal contact tightness between the groups. Tukey tests were used to find differences between the homogeneous subgroups. The use of sectional matrices combined with separation rings resulted in tighter proximal contacts compared to when circumferential systems were used (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Design {{guidelines}} {{have been}} established to prevent catastrophic rim fracture failure modes when considering gear tooth bending fatigue. Analysis was performed using the finite element method with principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Crack propagation paths were predicted {{for a variety of}} gear tooth and rim configurations. The effects of rim and web thicknesses, initial crack locations, and gear tooth geometry factors such as diametral pitch, number of teeth, pitch radius, and <b>tooth</b> <b>pressure</b> angle were considered. Design maps of tooth/rim fracture modes including effects of gear geometry, applied load, crack size, and material properties were developed. The occurrence of rim fractures significantly increased as the backup ratio (rim thickness divided by tooth height) decreased. The occurrence of rim fractures also increased as the initial crack location was moved down the root of the tooth. Increased rim and web compliance increased the occurrence of rim fractures. For gears with constant pitch radii, coarser-pitch teeth increased the occurrence of tooth fractures over rim fractures. Also, 25 deg pressure angle teeth had an increased occurrence of tooth fractures over rim fractures when compared to 20 deg pressure angle teeth. For gears with constant number of teeth or gears with constant diametral pitch, varying size had little or no effect on crack propagation paths...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to define optimal tooth modifications, {{introduced}} by appropriately chosen head-cutter geometry and machine tool setting, to simultaneously minimize <b>tooth</b> contact <b>pressure</b> and angular displacement error of the driven gear (transmission error) of face-hobbed spiral bevel gears. As a result of these modifications, the gear pair becomes mismatched, and a point contact replaces the theoretical line contact.

A computer program was developed to implement the formulation provided above.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Proximal contact {{tightness}} {{of class}} II resin composite restorations {{is influenced by}} a myriad of factors. Previous studies investigated the role of matrix band type and thickness, consistency of resin composite, and technique of placement. However, the effect of volumetric shrinkage of resin and intensity of curing light {{has yet to be}} determined. Thus, the aim {{of this study was to}} identify the influence of these factors on the proximal contact tightness when restoring class II cavity preparations in vitro. METHODS : Sixty artificial molars were restored with either a low-shrinkage (Filtek Silorane, 3 M ESPE) or a conventional (Z 100, 3 M ESPE) composite and polymerized with low-intensity (Smartlite IQ 2, Dentsply) or high-intensity light curing units (Demi(TM), Kerr). Proximal contact tightness was measured using the <b>Tooth</b> <b>Pressure</b> Meter. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc test. RESULTS : Use of low-shrinkage composite (Filtek Silorane) resulted in significantly tighter proximal contacts compared to the use of conventional composite (Z 100) when cured with the same polymerization unit (p< 0. 001). Moreover, the low-intensity curing unit (IQ 2) resulted in significantly tighter contacts than the high-intensity unit when material is constant (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS : Low-shrinkage resin composite and low curing light intensity is associated with tighter proximal contact values...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Crocodilians have {{dominated}} predatory niches at the water-land interface for over 85 million years. Like their ancestors, living species show substantial variation in their jaw proportions, dental form and body size. These differences are often assumed to reflect anatomical specialization related to feeding and niche occupation, but quantified data are scant. How these factors relate to biomechanical performance during feeding and their relevance to crocodilian evolutionary success are not known. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We measured adult bite forces and tooth pressures in all 23 extant crocodilian species and analyzed {{the results in}} ecological and phylogenetic contexts. We demonstrate that these reptiles generate the highest bite forces and tooth pressures known for any living animals. Bite forces strongly correlate with body size, and size changes are a major mechanism of feeding evolution in this group. Jaw shape demonstrates surprisingly little correlation to bite force and pressures. Bite forces can now be predicted in fossil crocodilians using the regression equations generated in this research. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Critical to crocodilian long-term success was {{the evolution of a}} high bite-force generating musculo-skeletal architecture. Once achieved, the relative force capacities of this system went essentially unmodified throughout subsequent diversification. Rampant changes in body size and concurrent changes in bite force served as a mechanism to allow access to differing prey types and sizes. Further access to the diversity of near-shore prey was gained primarily through changes in <b>tooth</b> <b>pressure</b> via the evolution of dental form and distributions of the teeth within the jaws. Rostral proportions changed substantially throughout crocodilian evolution, but not in correspondence with bite forces. The biomechanical and ecological ramifications of such changes need further examination...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to compare in-vitro the proximal contact tightness (PCT) of Class II resin composite restorations (RCR) placed with different established and new placement techniques. METHODS: 105 ivorine lower left first molars with standardized MO cavities were randomly divided into seven groups (n = 15) as follows: SRing: sectional matrix and separation ring (Garrison Dental); CRing: circumferential matrix (1101 -c, KerrHawe SA) with separation ring; CWedge: circumferential matrix with a wedge only; COptra: circumferential matrix and OptraContact (Vivadent); CCerana: circumferential matrix and a Cerana insert (Nordiska Dental); CElliot: circumferential matrix and Elliot separator (PFINGST & Co) and Walser: Walser matrix O-type (Dr Walser Dental GmbH). In all the groups, the matrix band was secured using a wooden wedge except for the Walser group, following manufacturer's recommendations. A Tofflemire retainer (Kerr Corporation) was used to apply the circumferential matrix band whenever it was used. All the prepared teeth were restored with resin composite (Premise, Kerr) mounted in a manikin head to simulate the clinical environment. PCT was measured using the <b>Tooth</b> <b>Pressure</b> Meter (University of Technology, Delft). The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests (p < 0. 05). RESULTS: Compared to the control group (SRing) (6. 64 +/- 1. 06 N), all other systems resulted in significantly lower PCT values (p < 0. 001). Within the circumferential matrix groups, CRing (4. 01 +/- 0. 53 N) and CElliot (4. 29 +/- 1. 08 N) showed significantly tighter contacts compared to the CWedge (0. 37 +/- 0. 22 N), COptra (0. 91 +/- 0. 49 N), CCerana (2. 99 +/- 1. 98 N) and Walser (1. 34 +/- 0. 55 N) (p < 0. 05) group.

40|$|OBJECTIVE : The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{proximal}} contact tightness (PCT) of MOD resin composite restorations placed with different matricing protocols. METHODS : Forty-five ivorine lower right first molars with standardized MOD cavities were equally divided into three groups according to the restoration protocol. Group 1 : Sectional matrix (Standard matrix, Palodent, Dentsply) secured with a wedge (Premier Dental Products Co.) and separation ring (BiTine I, Palodent, Dentsply, York, PA, USA) was used to restore the mesial surface first and then removed and repeated for the distal surface. Group 2 : Identical to group 1, but separation rings were placed at both the mesial and distal sides (BiTine I+II, Palodent) prior to restoration. Mesial surface was restored followed by distal. Group 3 : Walser matrix (O-form, Dr. Walser Dental GmbH) was used. Following composite resin restoration, PCT was measured using the <b>tooth</b> <b>pressure</b> meter. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and a Tukey post hoc test (p< 0. 05). RESULTS : PCT values for mesial contacts were 2. 99 +/- 0. 47 N for group 1, 4. 57 +/- 0. 36 N for group 2, and 3. 03 +/- 0. 79 N for group 3. For the distal contacts, the values were 4. 46 +/- 0. 44 N for group 1, 5. 12 +/- 0. 13 N for group 2, and 0. 76 +/- 0. 77 N for group 3. Significantly tighter contacts were obtained for mesial and distal contacts for group 2 compared to groups 1 and 3 (p< 0. 05). For groups 1 and 3, mesial contacts were not significantly different (p= 0. 993), while distal contacts for group 1 were significantly tighter (p< 0. 001).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} composite resin consistency and placement technique on proximal contact tightness of Class II composite resin restorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A manikin model (KaVo Dental) was used with an artificial first molar in which a standardized MO preparation was ground. This preparation was duplicated 360 times. Cavities were restored using Clearfil Photo Bond (Kuraray) combined with one of three composite resins of different consistencies: a low-viscosity (X-Flow, Dentsply), a medium-viscosity (Clearfil AP-X, Kuraray) and a high-viscosity composite (Tetric Ceram HB, Ivoclar Vivadent). Each composite was combined with 6 different matrix systems and separation techniques (n = 20). Groups 1 and 2 : precontoured metal circumferential matrix (KerrHawe 1101 -c) in a Tofflemire retainer combined either with hand instrument (OptraContact, Ivoclar Vivadent) or separation ring (Composi-Tight Gold, Garrison Dental Solutions). Group 3 : pre-contoured metal sectional matrix (Lite-Flex, Danville Materials) with separation ring. Groups 4 and 5 : pre-contoured metal circumferential dead-soft matrix (Adapt SuperCap, KerrHawe) with or without separation ring. Group 6 : flat metal circumferential matrix (OptraMatrix, Ivoclar Vivadent) in a Tofflemire-retainer with hand instrument (OptraContact). Proximal contact tightness was measured using the <b>Tooth</b> <b>Pressure</b> Meter (University of Technology, Delft). To {{determine the effect of}} experimental variables on the proximal contact tightness, a multiple linear regression model was constructed. RESULTS: Measurements in group 6 were not possible; therefore, this group was excluded. The use of medium- or high-viscosity instead of a low-viscosity composite resin resulted in statistically significantly tighter proximal contacts (p < 0. 01). The use of a separation ring resulted in a large, statistically significant increase (p < 0. 001) in contact tightness, while the use of a hand instrument resulted in a small, statistically significant increase of contact tightness (p = 0. 017). No statistically significant differences were found when a dead-soft matrix or a sectional matrix was used instead of a Tofflemire (p = 0. 159, p = 0. 261, resp.). CONCLUSION: Use of a separation ring when restoring a Class II composite resin restoration has a greater influence on the obtained proximal contact tightness compared to the influence of the consistency of the composite resin...|$|E
40|$|Effective gear designs balance strength, durability, reliability, size, weight, and cost. However, {{unexpected}} gear failures {{may occur}} even with adequate gear tooth design. To design an extremely safe system, the designer must ask {{and address the}} question "What happens when a failure occurs?" With regard to gear-tooth bending fatigue, tooth or rim fractures may occur. For aircraft, a crack that propagated through a rim would be catastrophic, leading to the disengagement of a rotor or propeller, the loss of an aircraft, and possible fatalities. This failure mode should be avoided. However, a crack that propagated through a tooth {{might or might not}} be catastrophic, depending on the design and operating conditions. Also, early warning of this failure mode might be possible because of advances in modern diagnostic systems. An analysis was performed at the NASA Glenn Research Center to develop design guidelines to prevent catastrophic rim fracture failure modes in the event of gear-tooth bending fatigue. The finite element method was used with principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics. Crack propagation paths were predicted for a variety of gear tooth and rim configurations. The effects of rim and web thicknesses, initial crack locations, and gear-tooth geometry factors such as diametral pitch, number of teeth, pitch radius, and <b>tooth</b> <b>pressure</b> angle were considered.

In a split-mouth design, 27 patients {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two groups (W or S). In 11 patients, an interdental wooden wedge (Hawe-Neos) was placed (group W), and in 16 patients, a separation ring (Composi-Tight Gold) was placed at the contact between teeth 4 / 5 and 5 / 6. Simultaneously, in both groups, a wooden wedge, combined with a separation ring (Composi-Tight Gold), was placed on the contact between teeth 4 / 5 and 5 / 6 (reference group W+S). To measure proximal contact tightness, frictional forces were recorded at the removal of a 0. 05 mm thick metal matrix band inserted between adjacent teeth. Contact tightness was measured at contacts 4 and 5 and at 5 and 6 in the third and fourth quadrant using the <b>Tooth</b> <b>Pressure</b> Meter prior to applying separation devices (TO) five minutes after application (T 1) and five minutes after removal of the devices (T 2). The effect of separation was determined by calculating the differences between contact tightness before application and contact tightness with the devices in situ (T 1 -T 0). Interdental recovery was calculated by the difference in contact tightness before application and after removal of the devices (T 2 -T 0). To assess the presence of statistically significant differences between these measurement times, paired t-tests were applied. With each patient, either a comparison between W and W+S or S and W+S was made. For both W versus W+S and S versus W+S, paired t-tests were applied to compare differences (T 1 -T 0 and T 2 -T 0) between the separation devices. Within a patient, groups W and S could not be compared, therefore, to compare separation achieved between these two devices, unpaired t-tests were used. The increase in contact tightness measured at contact 4 and 5 for group W (0. 98 +/- 0. 26 N) was statistically significantly less compared to the increase in group S (5. 48 +/- 0. 88 N) (p < 0. 001) or group W+S (4. 62 +/- 0. 68 N) (p = 0. 02). No significant differences were found between groups S and W+S (p = 0. 77). For all groups, five minutes after removal of the devices, the contact tightness at contact 4 and 5 and at contact 5 and 6 were still significantly weaker compared to the tightness at baseline (p < 0. 02).

The problem of bond testing is that materials are seldom compared with a standard, and experimental conditions often vary. We sought to identify the parameters that influence this variability. Using inclusion and exclusion criteria, we conducted a meta-analytical review of 75 articles, published between 1992 and 1996 in SCI reviews, that give bond strength data for 15 dentin-bonding agents of the so-called third and fourth generations. Seventeen selected parameters were classified into four groups: Group A includes factors related to the dentin substrate (i. e., nature of teeth); group B, composite and bonding area (i. e., composite stiffness); group C, storage conditions of the bonded samples (i. e., thermocycling); and group D, test design (i. e., crosshead speed). For each report, the experimental features, the bond strength means and standard deviations, and the failure mode were extracted and tabulated. Statistical Analysis System software was used to perform Pearson correlation analysis and analysis of variance, with bond strength {{as the dependent variable}} and experimental conditions as the independent variables.

The optmal head-cutter geometry and machine tool settings are determined to introduce the optimal tooth surface modifications into the teeth of spiral bevel and hypoid gears. The aim of these tooth surface modifications is to simultaneously reduce the <b>tooth</b> contact <b>pressure</b> and the transmission errors, to maximize the EHD load carrying capacity of the oil film, and to minimize power losses in the oil film. The proposed advanced method for the manufacture of spiral bevel and hypoid gears is based on machine tool setting variation on the cradle-type generator conducted by optimal polynomial functions and {{on the use of}} a CNC hypoid generator. An algorithm is developed for the execution of motions on the CNC hypoid generator using the optimal relations on the cradle-type machine. Effectiveness of the method was demonstrated by using spiral bevel and hypoid gear examples. Significant improvements in the operating characteristics of the gear pairs are achieved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general approach {{to predict the}} contact fatigue life of the gears in the drive-train system of a wind turbine under dynamic conditions. A simplified predictive pitting model that estimates service lives is presented and validated by comparisons with published experimental evidence. Finally, the predictive model is used to estimate the contact fatigue lives of the sun gear and planetary gears in the drive-train system of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s 750 kW land-based wind turbine based on time domain simulations. The occurrence frequencies of different wind speeds are described by the generalized gamma distribution. The time series of the torques in the main shaft are obtained from a global dynamic response analysis of the wind turbine. The time series of the gear contact forces is obtained from a dynamic analysis of the gearbox using multi-body simulation. The two-parameter Weibull distribution, the three-parameter Weibull distribution, and the generalized-gamma distribution are used to fit the long-term probabilistic distribution of the gear <b>tooth</b> contact <b>pressures.</b> The case study shows {{the validity of the}} approach presented in this paper...|$|R
