5|$|Boston College, {{in their}} first {{possession}} of the second half, fared even worse than Virginia Tech did. Two incomplete passes and a 5-yard delay of game penalty forced Boston College into a three-and-out possession {{that resulted in a}} punt. On its second possession, Virginia Tech had a three-and-out drive, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> part to an 11-yard sack of Sean Glennon by Boston College's Kevin Atkins.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, English {{was back}} in fashion among all classes, though much changed; the Middle English form showed many signs of French influence, both in {{vocabulary}} and spelling. During the English Renaissance, many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins. Modern English has extended this custom of flexibility, {{when it comes to}} incorporating words from different languages. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> large part to the British Empire, the English language is the world's unofficial lingua franca.|$|E
5|$|The Browns won another {{championship}} in 1954, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> {{part to a}} strong regular-season performance from Lavelli. Lavelli led the team in receiving that year and made the Pro Bowl after the Browns beat the Lions for their second NFL title. A third NFL championship followed in 1955. In the championship game against the Rams, Lavelli caught a touchdown {{in the second quarter}} and scored a second time on a 50-yard pass just {{before the end of the}} first half. The Browns won 38–14.|$|E

5|$|The Hokies {{lived up}} to their favored status in the first half, running up a 21-3 lead before halftime, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> part to a well-executed pass by wide {{receiver}} Eddie Royal on a trick play. Royal also performed well during punt and kick returns, putting Virginia Tech in good field position throughout the half.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} initially {{followed through}} with this recommendation but the move was widely disapproved of by scholars of Japanese affairs including Cortazzi and <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> part to their protests the Foreign Affairs Ministry eventually agreed to revive Japan Echo as an online magazine, which would be produced {{on an annual basis}} by whichever company put forward the best bid.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{presidency}} of Giorgio Ascarelli, the club {{changed its name to}} Associazione Calcio Napoli on 23 August 1926. After a poor start, with a sole point in an entire championship, Napoli was readmitted to Serie A's forerunner, the Divizione Nazionale, by the Italian Football Federation ("FIGC"), and began to improve <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> part to Paraguayan-born Attila Sallustro, who was the first fully fledged hero to the fans. He was a capable goal-scorer and eventually set the all-time goal-scoring record for Napoli, which was later bested by players like Diego Maradona and Marek Hamšík.|$|E

5|$|A Night to Remember {{was only}} Lord's second book {{but was a}} huge success, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> no small part to the {{aggressive}} advertising campaign carried out by R & W Holt following its launch in November 1955. The book also undoubtedly benefited from {{the popularity of the}} 1953 film Titanic and other coverage of the disaster that was published around the same time. Within two months of its publication, the book had sold 60,000 copies and remained listed as a best-seller for six months. The Ladies' Home Journal and Reader's Digest both published condensed versions and it was selected in June 1956 by the Book of the Month Club. The first paperback edition was published by Bantam Books in October 1956.|$|E
5|$|As America's {{involvement}} in World War II intensified, Motley joined the U.S. Navy in 1944 {{and was sent}} to the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. There he played for the Great Lakes Navy Bluejackets, a military team coached by Paul Brown, who was serving in the Navy during an extended leave from his job as head coach of The Ohio State University's football team. Motley played fullback and linebacker at Great Lakes, and was {{an important component of the}} team's offense and defense. The highlight of his time at Great Lakes was a 39–7 victory over Notre Dame in 1945. Motley was eligible for discharge before the game – it was the final match of the season and the last military game of World War II – but he stayed on to play. Motley put up an impressive performance, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> part to Brown's experimentation with a new play: a delayed handoff later called the draw play.|$|E
5|$|Gossip {{was also}} a noted writer. His {{treatise}} The Chess-Player's Manual—A Complete Guide to Chess, a 900-page tome published in 1874 {{after several years of}} work, was harshly received by the critics, largely because he had included a number of informal skittles games that he had (atypically) won against stronger players. As a result, Gossip developed a lifelong enmity toward chess critics, whom he often attacked ferociously in his books. However, his 1879 book Theory of the Chess Openings was well received. Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Chess Champion, wrote that the 1888 edition of The Chess-Player's Manual {{was one of the best}} available books on the game. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> part to a 122-page appendix by S. Lipschütz, it became one of the standard opening works of the time.|$|E

5|$|In England, Stephen's reign {{started off}} well, with lavish gatherings {{of the royal}} court that saw the King give out grants of land and favours to his supporters. Stephen {{received}} the support of Pope Innocent II, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> part to the testimony of Louis VI and Theobald. Troubles rapidly began to emerge. Matilda's uncle, David I of Scotland, invaded the north of England on the news of Henry's death, taking Carlisle, Newcastle and other key strongholds. Stephen rapidly marched north with an army and met David at Durham, where a temporary compromise was agreed. South Wales rose in rebellion, and by 1137 Stephen was forced to abandon attempts to suppress the revolt. Stephen put down two revolts in the south-west led by Baldwin de Redvers and Robert of Bampton; Baldwin was released after his capture and travelled to Normandy, where he became a vocal critic of the King.|$|E
5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} {{in the lower}} right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer. He {{is a microcosm of}} the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last Supper and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E
5|$|Nancy never lacks money, and {{in later}} {{volumes of the}} series often travels to faraway locations, such as France in The Mystery of the 99 Steps (1966), Nairobi in The Spider Sapphire Mystery (1968), Austria in Captive Witness (1981), Japan in The Runaway Bride (1994), Costa Rica in Scarlet Macaw Scandal (2004), and Alaska in Curse of The Arctic Star (2013). Nancy is also able to travel freely about the United States, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> part to her car, which is a blue {{roadster}} in the original series and a blue convertible in the later books. Despite the trouble and presumed expense to which she goes to solve mysteries, Nancy never accepts monetary compensation; however, by implication, her expenses are often paid by a client of her father's, {{as part of the}} costs of solving one of his cases.|$|E

5|$|Riley {{began his}} career writing verses as a sign maker and {{submitting}} poetry to newspapers. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> part to an endorsement from poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the latter 1870s. Riley gradually rose in prominence during the 1880s through his poetry reading tours. He traveled a touring circuit first in the Midwest, and then nationally, holding shows and making joint appearances on stage with other famous talents. Riley was an alcoholic, never married or had children, and created a scandal in 1888 when he became too drunk to perform. He became more popular {{in spite of the}} bad press he received, and as a result extricated himself from poorly negotiated contracts that limited his earnings; he quickly became very wealthy.|$|E
5|$|The 1950 {{season was}} another strong one for Cleveland. The team {{finished}} {{the regular season}} with a 10–2 record, tied with the New York Giants for {{first place in the}} American Conference. This set up a playoff with the Giants to secure a spot in the championship game against the Los Angeles Rams. Cleveland won 8–3, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> part to Gillom's punts. His kicks repeatedly gave the Giants poor field position and pinned them near their own end zone. The Browns {{went on to win the}} championship against the Rams on a last-minute Lou Groza field goal. Gillom finished second in the league in punting average, with 43.2 yards.|$|E
5|$|The SG-1000's launch did {{not prove}} to be successful. The three launch games, {{all of which were}} ported from Sega's VIC dual-arcade board, lacked the name {{recognition}} of Famicom launch games Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr., and Popeye. However, the situation was quickly turned around. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> part to the SG-1000's steadier stream of releases (21 SG-1000 games by the end of 1983, as compared to only 9 Famicom games), and in part to a recall on Famicom units necessitated by a faulty circuit, the SG-1000 chalked up 160,000 units in sales in 1983, far exceeding Sega's projection of 50,000 units.|$|E

5|$|The {{detailed}} {{investigation into}} corruption that St Vincent began {{caused him to}} become extremely unpopular as many influential men {{were involved in the}} various money making schemes perpetrated. The board of inquiry set up by St Vincent was responsible for the impeachment of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville and his trial for misappropriation of public funds. St Vincent had made an enemy of Pitt and Pitt used the naval reform and its unpopularity to attack the First Lord and the Addington administration. St Vincent left the office on 14 May 1804 when Addington was replaced as Prime Minister by Pitt. Lord Howick, second son of St Vincent's friend Sir Charles Grey came to his defence and with the assistance of Charles James Fox moved for a vote of <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> the Commons for St Vincent's tireless efforts in naval reform in 1806.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{period that}} {{came to be known as}} the McCarthy era began well before Joseph McCarthy's own involvement in it. Many factors contributed to McCarthyism, some of them extending back to the years of the First Red Scare (1917–20), inspired by Communism's emergence as a recognized political force. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> part to its success in organizing labor unions and its early opposition to fascism, the Communist Party of the United States increased its membership through the 1930s, reaching a peak of about 75,000 members in 1940–41. While the United States was engaged in World War II and allied with the Soviet Union, the issue of anti-communism was largely muted. With the end of World War II, the Cold War began almost immediately, as the Soviet Union installed Communist puppet régimes across Central and Eastern Europe, while the United States backed anti-communist forces in Greece and China.|$|E
5|$|The symphony had {{established}} itself {{by the end}} of the 18th century as the most prestigious of instrumental genres. While the genre had been developed with considerable intensity throughout that century and appeared in a wide range of occasions, it was generally used as an opening or closing work; in between would be works that included vocal and instrumental soloists. Because of its lack of written text for focus, it was seen as a vehicle for entertainment rather than for social, moral or intellectual ideas. As the symphony grew in size and artistic significance, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> part to efforts in the form by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, it also amassed greater prestige. A concurrent change in attitude toward instrumental music in general also took place, and the lack of text, once seen as a handicap, became considered a virtue.|$|E
