5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along {{the front edge of}} the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> <b>the</b> extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the seventeenth}} century, composers began {{creating}} works of a more emotional style. They felt that a monophonic style better suited the emotional music and wrote musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice. As a result, many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics, and therefore were seen as unemotional, fell out of favor. One such instrument was the shawm. Bowed instruments such as the violin, viola, baryton, and various lutes dominated popular music. Beginning in around 1750, however, the lute disappeared from musical compositions {{in favor of the}} rising popularity of the guitar. As the prevalence of string orchestras rose, wind instruments such as the flute, oboe, and bassoon were readmitted <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> <b>the</b> monotony of hearing only strings.|$|E
5|$|In 1841, {{following}} {{suggestions from}} the local paving board, Barry agreed that two fountains should be installed <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> <b>the</b> effects of reflected heat and glare from the asphalt surface. The First Commissioner of Woods and Forests welcomed the plan because the fountains reduced the open space available for public gatherings and reduced the risk of riotous assembly. The fountains were fed from two wells, one {{in front of the}} National Gallery and one behind it connected by a tunnel. Water was pumped to the fountains by a steam engine housed in a building behind the gallery.|$|E

5|$|In {{reality the}} House of Hohenzollern, of which Albrecht was a member, the ruling {{family of the}} Margraviate of Brandenburg, had been {{actively}} expanding its territorial influence; for example already in the 16th century in Farther Pomerania and Silesia. Motivated by a current political expediency, Sigismund Augustus in 1563 allowed the Brandenburg elector branch of the Hohenzollerns, excluded under the 1525 agreement, to inherit the Prussian fief rule. The decision, confirmed by the 1569 sejm, made the future union of Prussia with Brandenburg possible. Sigismind II, unlike his successors, was however careful to assert his supremacy. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, ruled after 1572 by elective kings, was even less able <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> <b>the</b> growing importance of the dynastically active Hohenzollerns.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} game Georgia Tech {{defeated}} Furman 25–0, playing mainly substitutes. Hay was spread on the field in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> <b>the</b> steady downpour. Tech quarterback Al Hill scored two touchdowns, and Dan Whelchel (called Walthall) scored a third when he recovered a fumble by Theodore Shaver after crossing the goal line. Although Furman's lineup included future South Carolina Hall-of-Famer Speedy Speer, there was little Speer could do to affect the outcome. Tech's starting lineup was Ulrich (left end), Higgins (left tackle), Whelchel (left guard), Johnson (center), Wright (right guard), Doyle (right tackle), Colcord (right end), Hill (quarterback), Smith (left halfback), Shaver (right halfback), and Harlan (fullback).|$|E
5|$|Its {{high density}} and {{resistance}} to corrosion have been exploited {{in a number of}} related applications. It is used as ballast in sailboat keels. Its weight allows it to counterbalance the heeling effect of wind on the sails; being so dense it takes up a small volume and minimizes water resistance. It is used in scuba diving weight belts <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> <b>the</b> diver's buoyancy. In 1993, the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables.|$|E

50|$|Trimethylamine N-oxide is an osmolyte {{found in}} {{saltwater}} fish, sharks, rays, molluscs, and crustaceans.

5|$|Pyridoxine, {{also known}} as vitamin B6, can be used <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> <b>the</b> {{inhibition}} by MMH on the pyridoxine-dependent step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA. Thus GABA synthesis can continue and symptoms are relieved. Pyridoxine, which is only useful for the neurological symptoms and does not decrease hepatic toxicity, is given at a dose of 25mg/kg; this can be repeated up to a maximum total of 15 to 30g daily if symptoms do not improve. Benzodiazepines are given to control seizures; as they also modulate GABA receptors they may potentially increase the effect of pyridoxine. Additionally MMH inhibits the chemical transformation of folic acid into its active form, folinic acid, this can be treated by folinic acid given at 20–200mg daily.|$|E

5|$|The {{sea otter}} has a {{metabolic}} rate {{two or three}} times that of comparatively sized terrestrial mammals. It must eat an estimated 25 to 38% of its own body weight in food each day to burn the calories necessary <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> <b>the</b> loss of heat due to the cold water environment. Its digestive efficiency is estimated at 80 to 85%, and food is digested and passed in as little as three hours. Most of its need for water is met through food, although, in contrast to most other marine mammals, it also drinks seawater. Its relatively large kidneys enable it to derive fresh water from sea water and excrete concentrated urine.|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{is expected to}} produce secondary mental health effects that may increase suicide and alcohol death rates. However, the mental health effects of the {{economic crisis}} can be offset by social welfare and other policy measures. For example, active labour market programmes aimed at helping people retain or regain jobs <b>counteract</b> <b>the</b> mental health effects of the economic crisis. Family support programmes contribute <b>to</b> <b>counteracting</b> <b>the</b> mental health effects of the crisis. Increasing alcohol prices and restricting alcohol availability reduce the harmful effects on mental health and save lives. Debt relief programmes will help to reduce the mental health effects of the economic crisis and accessible and responsive primary care services support people at risk and prevent mental health effects...|$|R

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>counteract</b> <b>the</b> French {{deployment}} to the region, a small British {{force was}} organised by Vice-Admiral Albemarle Bertie at Cape Town {{under the command}} of Commodore Josias Rowley, with orders to blockade Isle de France and Île Bonaparte and seize or destroy any French ships that operated from the islands. To perform this task, Rowley was given the old ship of the line HMS Raisonnable, the fourth rate HMS Leopard, frigates HMS Nereide, HMS Sirius and HMS Boadicea and a number of smaller ships. Both the British and the French squadrons reached the Indian Ocean in the spring of 1809.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Dyson swarm, the {{constructs}} {{making it up}} are not in orbit around the star, but would be statites—satellites suspended by use of enormous light sails using radiation pressure <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> <b>the</b> star's pull of gravity. Such constructs {{would not be in}} danger of collision or of eclipsing one another; they would be totally stationary with regard to the star, and independent of one another. Because the ratio of radiation pressure to the force of gravity from a star is constant regardless of the distance (provided the statite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to the surface of its star), such statites could also vary their distance from their central star.|$|E
5|$|When Hitler {{was named}} {{chancellor}} of Germany in January 1933, Göring was appointed as minister without portfolio, Minister of the Interior for Prussia, and Reich Commissioner of Aviation. Wilhelm Frick was named Reich Interior Minister. Frick {{and head of}} the Schutzstaffel (SS) Heinrich Himmler hoped to create a unified police force for all of Germany, but Göring on 30 November 1933 established a Prussian police force, with Rudolf Diels at its head. The force was called the Geheime Staatspolizei, or Gestapo. Göring, thinking that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> <b>the</b> power of the SA, handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934.
