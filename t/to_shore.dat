MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard {{to see that}} they were well quartered; to their delight, he announced that since this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all the women and children would sail free of charge.

5|$|Both {{species are}} listed as {{vulnerable}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their gill rakers for use in Chinese medicine. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are more vulnerable closer <b>to</b> <b>shore.</b> Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.|$|E

40|$|Very heavy {{catches of}} {{ribbonfish}} were observed quite close <b>to</b> the <b>shore</b> at Visakhapatnam {{for a very}} short duration. Observations were made on this fishery and certain important biological aspects Ribbonfish do not generally come very close <b>to</b> the <b>shore.</b> As such they are vei 7 rarely caught in the shore-seines. They are normally caught in boatseines operating 3 - 4 km away from the shore and in trawl nets.
