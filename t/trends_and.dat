40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a simple {{methodology}} for investigating how shocks to <b>trend</b> <b>and</b> cycle are correlated in unidentified unobserved components models, {{in which the}} correlation is not identified. The proposed methodology is applied to U. S. and U. K. real GDP data. We find that the correlation parameters are negative for both countries. We also investigate how changing the identification restriction results in different <b>trend</b> <b>and</b> cycle estimates. It is found that estimates of the <b>trend</b> <b>and</b> cycle can vary substantially depending on the identification restrictions imposed.

It was voted the best science fiction film ever made in a 2004 poll of 60 eminent world scientists. Blade Runner is also cited as an important influence to both the style and story of the Ghost in the Shell film series, which itself has been highly influential to the future-noir genre. Blade Runner has been very influential to the cyberpunk movement. It also influenced the cyberpunk derivative biopunk, which revolves around biotechnology and genetic engineering.|$|E

5|$|Narayan's writing {{technique}} was unpretentious {{with a natural}} element of humour about it. It focused on ordinary people, reminding the reader of next-door neighbours, cousins and the like, thereby providing a greater ability {{to relate to the}} topic. Unlike his national contemporaries, he was able to write about the intricacies of Indian society without having to modify his characteristic simplicity to conform to <b>trends</b> <b>and</b> fashions in fiction writing. He also employed the use of nuanced dialogic prose with gentle Tamil overtones based on the nature of his characters. Critics have considered Narayan to be the Indian Chekhov, due to the similarities in their writings, the simplicity and the gentle beauty and humour in tragic situations. Greene considered Narayan to be more similar to Chekhov than any Indian writer. Anthony West of The New Yorker considered Narayan's writings to be of the realism variety of Nikolai Gogol.|$|E

In contrast to previous literature, our model allows for explicit correlation between all the contemporaneous <b>trend</b> <b>and</b> cycle shocks. We find that all the G- 7 countries have highly variable stochastic permanent components for output, even once we allow for structural breaks. We also find that common restrictions on the correlations between <b>trend</b> <b>and</b> cycle shocks are rejected by the data.
