40|$|Abstract In January 2005, {{the quota}} system for imports of {{textiles}} and clothing was phased out and gave way to more liberalized global trade in {{textiles and clothing}}. The T&C industry is Pakistan’s main export engine. It is also a major industrial employer, {{and one of the}} few sectors that provide paid employment to female workers. The policy paper highlights the potentially negative impact of the phase out of the <b>textile</b> <b>quota</b> regime on employment-intensive garment production in Pakistan. This sub-sector also provides most employment for women workers. It demands mitigation of the expected social costs, for example, through skill upgrading, consistent implementation of existing labor laws and their extension to informal sector workers, as well as proactive policies that link Pakistani garments’ market access abroad with special regard for working conditions at home...|$|E

We quantify {{the impact of this}} spatial pattern using a Chinese firm-level data set. To ensure an exogenous set of potential new destinations (25 EU countries, US and Canada) and an exogenous timing of entry, we focus on firms that benefited from the abrupt end of the <b>textile</b> <b>quota</b> restrictions in 2005. Controlling for firmproduct and destination specific effects and ac- counting for possible multiple new export destinations we show that the probability to export to a country increases by 15 to 38 percent for each prior export destination with a geographical or cultural link with this country. export destination choice, spatial correlation, firm-level customs data, MFA/ATC quotaremoval...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} liberalizing tariffs and textile export quotas under Viet Nam’s accession to the WTO. To undertake the analysis, we develop a model of Viet Nam’s economy that reflects {{the importance of the}} duty exemption arrangements that allow export-oriented manufacturers to obtain intermediate inputs at world prices. The resulting GTAP-DD model is applied first to Viet Nam’s fourth multilateral tariff offer, and then to a hypothetical, deeper offer that takes Viet Nam’s average tariff below a simple average of 10 percent. The fourth offer is estimated to generate global gains of $ 460 million per year, of which over 60 percent accrues to Viet Nam. The deeper tariff experiment leads to annual gains of around $ 600 million per year, with $ 376 million accruing to Viet Nam. Under the fourth offer, most of the gains accrue from liberalization of the textile quotas, while the gains are roughly evenly split between tariff reform and <b>textile</b> <b>quota</b> abolition under the deeper reform scenario...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{government}} has {{realized that the}} {{textile and clothing sector}} is one sector that offers good prospects for diversification away from traditional commodity exports, for entry into the area of manufacturers, for absorption of large pools of manpower, for crossing the big divide between the rural and urban sectors, for poverty alleviation, and for gender empowerment. ” (Ministry of Finance, 2003, emphasis added) In 2005, the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) will give way to more liberalised global trade in textiles and clothing (T&C). The T&C industry is Pakistan’s major export engine. It also is a major employer of female workers. In the context of the social seclusion of women in Pakistan, the strong representation of women in the T&C industry makes the ATC implementation a gender equality issue. So far, the labour market implications of the change in the trade regime in general and its effects on gendered access to employment, in particular, have been neglected completely.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the effects of multi-fibre arrangement (MFA) quota elimination on Indian fibre market. The partial equilibrium Indian fibre model was developed using a theoretically consistent framework and incorporated regional supply response, substitutability between cotton and man-made fibres, and appropriate linkage between cotton and textile sectors. Baseline projections were developed for supply, demand and prices of cotton, man-made fibres and textiles under a set of exogenous assumptions. The effects of MFA <b>textile</b> <b>quota</b> eliminations were introduced into the model by conducting three scenarios, i. e. increasing textile exports by 10, 20 and 30 % from the baseline level. The results suggest that on an average, cotton imports rise by 4 - 8 % annually, while the man-made fibre exports from India decline {{with the opening of}} textile markets in the developed countries. The higher domestic cotton prices encourage acreage expansion in cotton in all the three regions in India, but not enough to meet rising mill demand under the scenarios of higher textile exports.

Despite rising labor costs, reminbi (RMB) appreciation, and lower demand from export markets, China’s textile industry is still growing at a healthy pace and looks to dominate the global apparel sector, both as a producer and as a consumer for years to come (Apparel Technology 2014). In comparison with other Asian textile and apparel players, even though Korea ranked eighth regarding textile and apparel exports in 2010 – 2012, as a developed country, it is also an important. In the past, Korea was a player in the international textile trade that saw its fortunes shift with the elimination of the EU <b>textile</b> <b>quotas</b> in 2005 period. That shift resulted in the plummeting of textile exports from $ 18.8 billion in 2000 to $ 11.6 billion in 2009.

It has also led to its diversion in trade, replacing exports to the U.S. with imports from China (Apparel Technology 2014).|$|R

40|$|The Cotonou Agreement {{introduces}} new {{fundamental principles}} {{with respect to}} trade between the European Union and African, Caribbean and Pacific countries relative to the Lom 9 Convention: in particular non-reciprocal preferential market access for ACP economies will only last until 1 January 2008. After that date, it {{will be replaced by}} a string of Economic Partnership Agreements meant to progressively liberalise trade in a reciprocal way. The progressive removal of barriers to trade is expected to result in the establishment of Free Trade Agreements between the EU and ACP regional groups in accordance with the relevant WTO rules and help further existing regional integration efforts among the ACP. In this paper, an applied general equilibrium model (15 regions, 9 sectors) is used to simulate the impact of EPAs for countries of the Southern African Development Community. The standard Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model has been extended to include the elimination of <b>textile</b> <b>quotas,</b> EU enlargement to 25 members as well as tax revenue sharing and a common external tariff among Southern African Customs Union countries. A number of comparisons between different scenarios are undertaken, in particular: (i) the EPA scenario is compared to the multilateral liberalization scenario; (ii) SADC liberalization with the EU only is compared to a scenario with simultaneous regional integration among African economies and to the case of the EU also signing an FTA with Mercosur; and (iii) a complete reduction of import barriers is contrasted with partial liberalization (i. e. only 50 per cent tariff reductions in agriculture) and with full trade liberalization that includes the elimination of subsidies. The issue of tariff revenue loss is also addressed and the required tax replacement is calculated. Selected experiments are re-run under an unemployment closure. Simulation results show that EPAs with the EU are welfare-enhancing for SADC overall, leading also to substantive increases in real GDP. For most countries further gains may arise from intra-SADC liberalization. The possibility of the EU entering an FTA with other countries, such as Mercosur, reduces estimated gains, but they still remain largely positive. Similarly, estimated gains need to be revised downwards if agriculture liberalization is not as far reaching as a reduction of import barriers for manufactures. At the sectoral level, the largest expansions in SADC economies take place in the animal agriculture and processed food sectors, while manufacturing becomes comparatively less attractive following EU-SADC liberalization. Interestingly, multilateral liberalization would instead foster some of the manufacturing sectors (textile and clothing and light manufacturing). Results also show the need for the SACU tariff pooling formula to be adjusted to reflect new import patterns as tariffs are removed...|$|R
