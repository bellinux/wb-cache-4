In the 2000 race, Rove is credited with masterminding the push poll that initiated the [...] "John McCain has a black love child" [...] whisper campaign in South Carolina. [...] Anonymous telephone pollsters, upon determining that a voter was pro-McCain, asked the question, [...] "Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain if you knew he had fathered a black child out of wedlock?" [...] The question was not overt slander, but it prompted the president of Bob Jones University to launch his own internet campaign against McCain, and succeeded in crippling the trust of voters McCain had attracted. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>camp</b> knew, as the general public did not, that in reality, John McCain is the adoptive father of a dark-skinned Bangladeshi refugee who was rescued by his wife Cindi.|$|E

[...] His parents, Marjorie Wagamese and Stanley Raven, had been among the many native children who, under Canadian law, were removed from their families and forced to attend certain government-run residential schools, the primary purpose of which was to separate them from their native culture.|$|E

5000|$|In November 1990 the Leyland Brothers {{opened the}} theme park Leyland Brothers World (...) , on a 40 ha {{property}} at North Arm Cove on the Pacific Highway north of Newcastle, New South Wales.

In a 1997 article in the Sunday Age, Mike Leyland said that the initial A$1 million loan blew out due to rain during construction and a 27% interest rate. In July 1992 Chris Palmer of BDO Nelson was appointed receiver and manager of the park when the Leyland Brothers company failed to meet its loan commitment to the Commonwealth Bank.

5000|$|Many argued that, since Iraq had no {{connection}} to the September 11, 2001 attacks, going to war against Iraq {{as part of a}} broader war on terror was illegitimate. Others opposed to US military action argued that insufficient and, as in the case of the uranium Niger deal, even falsified documents might have been produced in order to show Iraq as [...] "an immediate threat". Accordingly, any such exaggeration would have been contrary to international law. They also claimed that the issue of weapons of mass destruction (if indeed there were any left in Iraq by 2003) could have been solved through continued inspections and diplomacy, and insisted that the weapons issue was merely an attempt to hide American desires to seize oil wells, further a military presence in the Middle East, and frighten other OPEC nations into submission. This position was later supported by Bush's former Secretary of the Treasury Paul Henry O'Neill who stated that the administration had sought for a reason to invade Iraq ever since Bush took office, with potential oil spoils charted in early documents. <b>The</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>camp</b> denies these allegations as ludicrous, though they have admitted that the Niger uranium documents were given to them by a source of questionable credibility and it was simply a mistake on their part to have assumed that the documents told the truth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This article reports {{research}} that critically examined our teacher education outdoor education pedagogy. The {{purpose was to}} use visual ethnography to critique our teaching over twenty years of annual five-day bush-based residential <b>camps.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bush</b> <b>camps</b> were situated in an outdoor education programme contributing to a four-year undergraduate teacher education Bachelor of Physical Education in Aotearoa New Zealand. The research method involved photo-elicitation of selected photographs representing students’ experiences and our practices. We each wrote about the photographs using introspection and recall to create a layered narrative analysis reflecting on the educative focus of the images. We responded to one another’s narratives, challenging and/or supporting the reflexivity, to interpret our joint perspectives about the learning context, pedagogic rationale and outcomes. The research highlights our teacher educator perspectives about experiential learning. Some of this learning was directly attributed to our intentional pedagogy and some to the unpredictable, incidental, situated experience made possible by engagement in the outdoor environment...|$|R
