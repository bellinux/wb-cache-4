5|$|Bhunivelze's {{physical}} form for Lightning Returns {{was designed by}} Toshitaka Matsuda. Matsuda made his design elaborate and detailed as a representation of both Nova Chrysalia and <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>universe.</b> This design motif carried over to him being fused to the arena floor during the final battle. The character is voiced by Daniel Riordan in English and Yūki Kaji in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The ages of {{globular}} clusters place a bound {{on the age}} limit of <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>universe.</b> This lower limit {{has been a significant}} constraint in cosmology. Historically, astronomers were faced with age estimates of {{globular clusters}} that appeared older than cosmological models would allow. However, better measurements of cosmological parameters through deep sky surveys and satellites such as the Hubble Space Telescope appear to have resolved this issue.|$|E
5|$|According to Procopius, the Slavs {{believed}} in one god, {{the creator of}} lightning and master of <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>universe,</b> to whom all sacrificial animals (and sometimes people) were offered. The highest god was called Svarog throughout the Slavic area, but other gods were also worshiped in different regions at different times, often with local names. Natural objects such as rivers, groves or mountains were also celebrated, as well as nymphs, demons, ancestral and other spirits, who were all venerated and bought off with offering rituals, which also involved augury. Such beliefs and practices were later developed and individualized by the many Slavic tribes.|$|E

5|$|The Universe is all {{of space}} and time (spacetime) and its contents, which {{includes}} planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space and all matter and energy. While the size of <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>Universe</b> is still unknown, it is possible to measure the observable universe. Halpern and Tomasello calculated the observable universe using data from European Space Agency's Planck satellite, estimating it to be 90.68 billion light-years across, 0.7% smaller then previously thought.|$|E
5|$|The saga of StarCraft is {{ultimately}} completed with , which {{was released on}} November 10, 2015. StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void is a stand-alone game in which new units are added to all three races as well as changing existing units, and also makes groundbreaking changes to the economy-aspect of the game. The story of Starcraft is concluded by following the Protoss Race {{in their quest to}} reclaim their homeworld and for Kerrigan to ultimately slay the greatest threat to <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>universe.</b> The game is divided into a 3-mission prologue, a 19-mission main story campaign, and a 3-mission epilogue which wraps everything up.|$|E
5|$|After Keen finds Molly tied up at {{the back}} of the Bloog Control Center on the space station, she {{explains}} to him that she was kidnapped on the orders of her younger brother, who Keen knows to be his nemesis Mortimer McMire. Mortimer convinced the Bloogs to kidnap her by offering them the Stupendous Sandwich of Chungella IV. Keen is surprised, as he thought Mortimer was dead (he was apparently killed at the end of the Vorticon trilogy), and is dismayed to find out that Mortimer plans to blow up <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>universe.</b> This conclusion is also revealed in an encoded note at the end of the Galaxy. The game ends by asking the player to play the next installment, where Keen would again fight Mortimer.|$|E

5|$|In {{classical}} times, {{rather than}} making distant figures smaller with linear perspective, painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used reverse perspective for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his Book of Optics in 1021, but never applied it to art. The Renaissance saw a rebirth of Classical Greek and Roman culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand nature and the arts. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed {{to figure out how}} to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>universe,</b> including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening scene}} is a three-minute computer-generated sequence, {{beginning}} {{with a view of}} Earth from high in the exosphere and listening in on numerous radio waves of modern programming emitting from the planet. The camera then starts zooming backward, passing the Moon, Mars, and other features of the solar system, then to the Oort cloud, interstellar space, the Local Bubble, the Milky Way, other galaxies of the Local Group, and eventually into deep space. As this occurs, the radio signals start to drop out and reflect older programming, representing the distance these signals would have traveled at the speed of light, eventually becoming silent as the distance becomes much greater. The sequence eventually resolves into the iris of young Ellie's eye as she is listening on her amateur radio set. This scale view shot of <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>universe</b> was inspired by the short documentary film Powers of Ten (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated effect for a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening sequence from The Day After Tomorrow (2004).|$|E
5|$|Upon {{collecting}} enough Power Stars, the Comet Observatory regains {{the power}} to transform into a comet, and flies to {{the centre of the}} universe, where Bowser is holding Peach captive. Confronting Bowser, Mario learns that his plan is to rule <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>universe</b> with Peach at his side, using a newly constructed sun of his own via the power of the Grand Stars. Mario manages to defeat Bowser and free Peach, but Bowser's sun collapses into itself, becoming a supermassive black hole that begins consuming everything nearby. All of Rosalina's Lumas jump into the black hole to destroy it, but sacrifice themselves in the process. The black hole collapses into a singularity and explodes in a supernova. Rosalina appears to Mario as a giantess, revealing that dying stars are later reborn as new stars. Mario awakens in the restored Mushroom Kingdom, full with all of the creatures he had met in the galaxies, alongside Peach and Bowser, celebrating the new galaxy that has emerged in the skies.|$|E

50|$|Universalizing formal {{education}} {{has been one of}} the foundation's key objectives. It seeks to address the rights of <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>universes</b> of children- both in school and out of school - in the 5-14 age group and its area of operation. It sees children who are deprived of education opportunities as intrinsically hazardous to their growth and well-being. The MV Foundation also ensures that every child attending school does so without any disruption until she reaches class 10 since there is no guarantee that the child does not get pushed out of school to join the labour force again.|$|R
5|$|The Doctor and Clara {{attend the}} ceremony, where the Doctor {{explains}} {{that since the}} Rings were settled {{there has been a}} constant song sung to keep an angry god asleep. The people fear that the god, which they call Grandfather, will awaken and consume <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>universe</b> if the song is ever interrupted. Merry begins singing, joined by a chorister at the pyramid. During the song, a mummy in a glass case at the pyramid begins to awaken. Merry panics, believing she got the song wrong. A beam of light from the pyramid envelops her, and she is pulled toward the pyramid and the mummy. The Doctor and Clara find Dor'een and rent the space bike using Clara's mother's ring as payment. They ride the bike to the pyramid where they find the mummy struggling to escape the case and consume Merry's soul. The Doctor promises Merry that she does not have to sacrifice herself and that he will stop Grandfather. As they attempt to leave, a group of creatures called the Vigil arrive and attempt to force Merry to sacrifice herself. The Doctor holds the Vigil at bay long enough to let Clara and Merry escape from the throne room, but then the case shatters and the mummy breaks free. A ray of light strikes the planet, revealing that Grandfather is Akhaten itself, a planet-sized parasitic creature.|$|E
