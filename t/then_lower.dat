25|$|This new pro-house {{initiative}} was unofficially {{launched in the}} Summer term 2006, by a house events day for years 7 and 8.

25|$|To {{properly}} fly {{the flag}} at half-staff, one should first briefly hoist it {{top of the}} staff, <b>then</b> <b>lower</b> it to the half-staff position, halfway between {{the top and bottom}} of the staff.

25|$|Bleaching {{improves}} whiteness {{by removing}} natural coloration and remaining trace impurities from the cotton; {{the degree of}} bleaching necessary {{is determined by the}} required whiteness and absorbency. Cotton being a vegetable fibre will be bleached using an oxidizing agent, such as dilute sodium hypochlorite or dilute hydrogen peroxide. If the fabric is to be dyed a deep shade, <b>then</b> <b>lower</b> levels of bleaching are acceptable, for example. However, for white bed sheetings and medical applications, the highest levels of whiteness and absorbency are essential.|$|E
25|$|Bitrate is {{the product}} of the sample rate and number of bits per sample used to encode the music. CD audio is 44100 samples per second. The number of bits per sample also depends on the number of audio channels. CD is stereo and 16 bits per channel. So, {{multiplying}} 44100 by 32 gives 1411200—the bitrate of uncompressed CD digital audio. MP3 was designed to encode this 1411kbit/s data at 320kbit/s or less. As less complex passages are detected by MP3 algorithms <b>then</b> <b>lower</b> bitrates may be employed. When using MPEG-2 instead of MPEG-1, MP3 supports only lower sampling rates (16000, 22050 or 24000 samples per second) and offers choices of bitrate as low as 8kbit/s but no higher than 160kbit/s. By lowering the sampling rate, MPEG-2 layer III removes all frequencies above half the new sampling rate that may have been present in the source audio.|$|E
25|$|New to Soulblighter {{were moving}} 3D models within the gaming world, {{something}} none of Bungie staff had ever created before. For example, the opening level features a fully functional windmill, and a later level features a drawbridge that closes as the level begins, {{and which the}} player must <b>then</b> <b>lower</b> so their army can gain access to a castle. Although the original game featured {{the same kind of}} 3D polygonal models, none of them moved, and implementing this feature proved {{to be one of the}} biggest challenges the team encountered in making the game. Another challenge also involved something not seen in the first game; a level set indoors. For this level, which is set in a large castle, the AI had to be rewritten as two enemy units could be right beside one another but not be able to see each other because of a wall between them. Previously, two units standing beside one another would automatically attack. Writing this new code into the AI scripting language proved especially difficult for the programmers.|$|E

25|$|The actual {{ratios of}} fusion to Bremsstrahlung power {{will likely be}} {{significantly}} lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that {{the energy of the}} fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will <b>then</b> <b>lower</b> the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves must remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and will remain some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.|$|E
500|$|A {{population}} of high inclination trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axes less than 100 AU may be {{generated by the}} combined effects of Planet Nine and the other giant planets. Extreme trans-Neptunian objects that reach high inclination orbits while in the higher order secular resonance can have their perihelia lowered sufficiently for their orbits to intersect that of Neptune or the other giant planets. Encounters {{with one of these}} planets can <b>then</b> <b>lower</b> their semi-major axes to below 100 AU where their evolution would no longer be controlled by Planet Nine, leaving them on orbits like [...] The orbital distribution of the longest lived of these objects is nonuniform. Most objects have orbits with perihelia ranging from 5 AU to 35 AU and inclinations below 110 degree, beyond a gap with few objects are others with inclinations near 150 degrees and perihelia near 10 AU.|$|E
500|$|In Central Europe, wolves were {{dramatically}} {{reduced in}} number {{during the early}} nineteenth century, because of organized hunts and reductions in ungulate populations. In Bavaria, the last wolf was killed in 1847, and had disappeared from the Rhine regions by 1899 In Switzerland, wolves were extinct in the twentieth century; they are naturally coming back from Italy since the 1990s. In 1934, Nazi Germany became the first state in modern history to place the wolf under protection, though the species was already extirpated in Germany at this point. The last free-living wolf to be killed on the soil of present-day Germany before 1945 was the so-called [...] "Tiger of Sabrodt", which was shot near Hoyerswerda, Lusatia (<b>then</b> <b>Lower</b> Silesia) in 1904. Today, wolves {{have returned to the}} area. Wolf hunting in France was first institutionalized by Charlemagne between 800–813, when he established the louveterie, a special corps of wolf hunters. The louveterie was abolished after the French Revolution in 1789, but was re-established in 1814. In 1883, up to 1,386 wolves were killed, with many more by poison.|$|E

2500|$|The Panama Canal (...) is an {{artificial}} 77 km (48 mi) waterway in Panama {{that connects the}} Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of Panama and is a key conduit for international maritime trade. There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake, {{an artificial}} lake created {{to reduce the amount}} of excavation work required for the canal, 26 m (85 ft) above sea level, and <b>then</b> <b>lower</b> the ships at the other end. The original locks are 34 m (110 ft) wide. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded canal began commercial operation on June 26, 2016. The new locks allow transit of larger, Post-Panamax ships, capable of handling more cargo.|$|E
