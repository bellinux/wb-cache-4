Citing Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and Mahler as influences, Wainwright stated the string arrangements were his first attempt at writing chamber music. [...] "Between My Legs", which Wainwright wrote about a [...] "boy [...] was infatuated with named Tommy Hotpants", is a [...] "fantasy about being able <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>your</b> object of desire when the apocalypse comes, and bring him to some sort of hidden paradise." [...] The last 30 seconds of the song contains the opening notes of the title song from Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical The Phantom of the Opera, along with a dramatic spoken word part by Siân Phillips. According to Wainwright, [...] "Rules and Regulations" [...] was originally written as a slow ballad for Robert Wilson, and is about the perspective of [...] "someone who looks at athletes, but who is not an athlete".

2500|$|The Overland Campaign, Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's {{offensive}} against Lee {{in the spring}} of 1864, began at the Battle of the Wilderness, where Stuart aggressively pushed Thomas L. Rosser's Laurel Brigade into a fight against George Custer's better-armed Michigan Brigade, resulting in significant losses. General Lee sent a message to Stuart: [...] "It is very important <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>your</b> Cavalry & not wear it out. ... You must use your good judgment to make any attack which may offer advantages." [...] As the armies maneuvered toward their next confrontation at Spotsylvania Court House, Stuart's cavalry fought delaying actions against the Union cavalry. His defense at Laurel Hill, also directing the infantry of Brig. Gen. Joseph B. Kershaw, skillfully delayed the advance of the Federal army for nearly 5 critical hours.|$|E

2500|$|Of the {{decision}} to have Lexa betray Clarke, a significant moment for the series that allowed the writers to strain the characters' relationship, Rothenberg said Lexa {{was under the impression}} Clarke would likely die in the battle and Mount Weather would possibly remain to keep her people united. [...] "She was probably—master strategist that she is—thinking several moves ahead. Thinking she could keep her alliance together, the 12 clans, because they would still have this evil empire out there to unite them," [...] he stated. Lexa was not expecting Clarke to win, and to subsequently become a legend. [...] "Everywhere she goes it's like, 'I heard it was 5,000 people! No, I heard it was 10,000 people!' Everywhere she goes, [...] a legend now," [...] said Rothenberg. [...] "Certainly it means that her alliance now no longer has a real reason to be held together. [...] I'm really excited to play out the ramifications of all of that." [...] Rothenberg said Clarke would eventually {{come to terms with the}} likelihood that, if she had been in a similar position as Lexa, she would have done the same thing: Protect her own people at all costs. He said she did as much in the season 2 finale. [...] "That was kind of the theme of the entire season, which was how far can you go and still be the good guy in order <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>your</b> people. Lexa had that choice in [...] 15. Obviously, it landed very emotionally for both of them, but especially on Clarke," [...] he stated. [...] "In [...] 16, Clarke had a similar choice and I hope that over the course of the first part of , Clarke will eventually come to see it that way. If she can't, then they'll never figure out a way to make peace with each other".|$|E
