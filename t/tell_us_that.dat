25|$|Chronicles <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> {{together}} with Daniil Cherni he painted the Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir in 1408 {{as well as}} the Trinity Cathedral in the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius between 1425 and 1427. After Daniil's death, Andrei came to Moscow's Andronikov Monastery where he painted his last work, the frescoes of the Saviour Cathedral. He is also believed to have painted {{at least one of the}} miniatures in the Khitrovo Gospels.|$|E
25|$|Traditional biographies, {{including}} the Vita Iuvenalis, {{give us the}} writer's full name and also <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> he was either the son, or adopted son, of a rich freedman. He {{is supposed to have}} been a pupil of Quintilian, and to have practised rhetoric until he was middle-aged, both as amusement and for legal purposes. The Satires do make frequent and accurate references to the operation of the Roman legal system. His career as a satirist is supposed to have begun at a fairly late stage in his life.|$|E

No {{reason for this is}} given, but the logical thing is to conclude that his successor, his nephew Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti, {{had something to do with}} it. Indeed, the Annals of Tigernach <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the sons of Máel Brigte were responsible; the only sons we know of are Máel Coluim and Gille Coemgáin, both of whom evidently benefited from the killing, as both succeeded to the throne.|$|E

50|$|We {{compute the}} cohomology of CPn using the fibration:Now, on the E2 page, in the 0,0 {{coordinate}} {{we have the}} identity of the ring. In the 0,1 coordinate, we have an element i that generates Z. However, we know that by the limit page, there can only be nontrivial generators in degree 2n+1 <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the generator i must transgress to some element x in the 2,0 coordinate. Now, this <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> there must be an element ix in the 2,1 coordinate. We then see that d(ix) = x2 by the Leibniz rule <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the 4,0 coordinate must be x2 since there can be no nontrivial homology until degree 2n+1. Repeating this argument inductively until 2n+1 gives ixn in coordinate 2n,1 which must then be the only generator of Z in <b>that</b> degree thus <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the 2n+1,0 coordinate must be 0. Reading off the horizontal bottom row of the spectral sequence gives us the cohomology ring of CPn and it <b>tells</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the answer is Zx/xn+1.|$|R
25|$|Already in 1603, {{the sources}} <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> harpsichords {{were used in}} the Spanish and Portuguese synagogues in Hamburg. Particularly in the Amsterdam community, but to some degree also in Hamburg and elsewhere, there was a flourishing of Classical music in the synagogues in the 18th century. There was {{formerly}} a custom in Amsterdam, inspired by a hint in the Zohar, of holding an instrumental concert on Friday afternoon prior to the coming in of the Shabbat, as a means of getting the congregants in the right mood for the Friday night service. An important Jewish composer was Abraham Caceres; music was also commissioned from non-Jewish composers such as Cristiano Giuseppe Lidarti, some of which is still used.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s {{pioneering}} work of Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza and others, scientists have developed techniques {{that attempt to}} use genetic markers to indicate the ethnic background and history of individual people. The data developed by these mainstream scientists <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> the Native Americans have very distinctive DNA markers, {{and that some of}} them are most similar, among old world populations, to the DNA of people anciently associated with the Altay Mountains area of central Asia. This conclusion from a genetic perspective supports a large amount of archaeological, anthropological, and linguistic evidence that Native American peoples' ancestors migrated from Asia at the latest 16,500–13,000 years ago. (See Settlement of the Americas and Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas).|$|E
25|$|In 1644, Aurangzeb's sister, Jahanara, {{was burned}} when the {{chemicals}} in her perfume were ignited by a nearby lamp while in Agra. This event precipitated a family crisis with political consequences. Aurangzeb suffered his father's displeasure by not returning to Agra immediately but rather three weeks later. Shah Jahan had been nursing Jahanara {{back to health}} in that time and thousands of vassals had arrived in Agra to pay their respects. Shah Jahan was outraged to see Aurangzeb enter the interior palace compound in military attire and immediately dismissed him from his position of viceroy of the Deccan; Aurangzeb was also no longer allowed to use red tents or to associate himself with the official military standard of the Mughal emperor. Other sources <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> Aurangzeb was dismissed from his position because Aurangzeb left the life of luxury and became a Faqir.|$|E

25|$|Chad then {{proceeded}} to carry out much missionary and pastoral work within the kingdom. Bede tells us that Chad governed the bishopric of the Mercians and {{of the people of}} Lindsey 'in the manner of the ancient fathers and in great perfection of life'. However, Bede gives little concrete information about the work of Chad in Mercia, implying that in style and substance it was a continuation of what he had done in Northumbria. The area he covered was very large, stretching across England from coast to coast. It was also, in many places, difficult terrain, with woodland, heath and mountain over much of the centre and large areas of marshland to the east. Bede does <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> Chad built for himself a small house at Lichfield, a short distance from the church, sufficient to hold his core of seven or eight disciples, who gathered to pray and study with him there when he was not out on business.|$|E
25|$|Ancient biographies often {{represent}} famous poets {{as going}} into exile to escape their ungrateful fellow citizens. Thus for example Homer {{was said to}} have left Cyme because the government there would not support him at public expense (Vit. Herod. 13-14), Aeschylus left Athens for Sicily because Athenians valued him less than some other poets (Vit. Aesch.), while Euripides fled to Macedonia because of humiliation by comic poets (Vit. Eur.). Similarly Vitae A and B <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> Apollonius moved to Rhodes because his work was not well received in Alexandria. According to B, he redrafted the Argonautica in such fine style at Rhodes {{that he was able to}} return to Alexandria in triumph, where he was rewarded with a post in the library and finally a place in the cemetery next to Callimachus. These stories were probably invented to account for the existence of a second edition of Argonautica, indicated by variant readings in ancient manuscripts.|$|E
25|$|The Wingo quarter farm {{dates from}} 1790-1812 at Poplar Forest and was {{operational}} when Jefferson owned Poplar Forest; {{he gave the}} land on which it was located to Martha and Thomas Mann Randolph as a wedding present. Jefferson's surviving notes <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> three carpenters were able to construct a slave cabin in three days and that the slaves most often lived next to their field or shop work sites. Documentary {{evidence suggests that the}} slave housing structures at Poplar Forest were made of logs and that each house had two rooms that each measured 12.5 x 15 feet; this is corroborated by archaeological evidence suggesting that the slave structures contained root cellars designed by the occupants, which were used to store clothing, tools, and iron hardware. Archaeologists used soil stains to discover storage pits, burned tree roots, and postoles; this analysis also yielded fragments of glass, ceramics, and iron which were discovered to have been parts of plates, bottles, and cooking pots. One other structure discovered is believed to have functioned as a smokehouse as well as a residence, while a third {{is believed to have been}} built later than the other two, and used primarily as housing. Soil analysis also suggests that there were fences in the slave quarters.|$|E

25|$|Concerning {{the social}} {{position}} and the personal history of Rav we were not informed. That he was rich seems probable; for {{he appears to have}} occupied himself for a time with commerce and afterward with agriculture (Hullin 105a). He {{is referred to as the}} son of noblemen (Shabbat 29a) but it is not clear if this is an affectionate term or a true description of his status. Rashi does <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> he is being described as the son of great men. That he was highly respected by the Gentiles as well as by the Jews of Babylonia is proved by the friendship which existed between him and the last Parthian king, Artaban (Avodah Zarah 10b). He was deeply affected by the death of Artaban (226) and the downfall of the Arsacid dynasty, and does not appear to have sought the friendship of Ardeshir, founder of the Sassanian dynasty, although Samuel of Nehardea probably did so. Rav became closely related, through the marriage of one of his daughters, to the family of the exilarch. Her sons, Mar Ukba and Nehemiah, were considered types of the highest aristocracy. Rav had many sons, several of whom are mentioned in the Talmud, the most distinguished being the eldest, Chiyya. The latter did not, however, succeed his father as head of the academy: this post fell to Rav's disciple Rav Huna. Two of his grandsons occupied in succession the office of exilarch (resh galuta) (Hullin 92a).|$|E
25|$|The same {{criticism}} {{is even more}} emphatically applicable {{to the influence of}} a not-self, or world of forces, corresponding to our sensations, and the cause of them. Starting from sensation as our basis, causality could never give us this, even though it be allowed that sensation is impersonal to the extent of being independent of our volition. Causality might <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>that</b> a cause there is of sensation somewhere and of some sort; but that this cause is a force or sum of forces, existing in space, independently of us, and corresponding to our sensations, it could never tell us, {{for the simple reason that}} such a notion is not supposed to exist in our consciousness. Causality cannot add to the number of our notions,--cannot add to the number of realities we know. All it can do is to necessitate us to think that a cause there is of a given change, but what that cause is it cannot of itself inform us, or even suggest to us, beyond implying that it must be to the effect. Sensation might arise, for aught we know, so far as causality leads us, not from a world of forces at all, but from a will like our own, though infinitely more powerful, acting upon us, partly furthering and partly thwarting us. And indeed such a supposition is, with the principle of causality at work, within the limits of probability, as we are already supposed to know such a reality—a will—in our own consciousness. When Cousin thus set himself to vindicate those points by reflection, he gave up the obvious advantage of his other position that the realities in question are given us in immediate and spontaneous apprehension. The same criticism applies equally to the inference of an absolute cause from the two limited forces which he names self and not-self. Immediate spontaneous apperception may seize this supreme reality; but to vindicate it by reflection as an inference on the principle of causality is impossible. This is a mere paralogism; we can never infer either absolute or infinite from relative or finite.|$|E
