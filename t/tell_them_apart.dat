25|$|Hemipepsis ustulata {{generally}} have matte black bodies with rust-orange wings. They {{are among the}} largest of Hymenoptera, growing up to 5cm in length. It is difficult to distinguish Hemipepsis from their Pepsis relatives. However, Pepsis {{tend to be a}} more metallic black with a deep blue striped patterning. Since their biology and appearance is so similar, the only reliable way to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>apart</b> is by their wing venation patterns.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} {{conveyed by}} a single cone is limited: by itself, the cell cannot tell the brain which wavelength of light caused its excitation. A visual pigment may absorb two wavelengths equally, but even though their photons are of different energies, the cone cannot <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>apart,</b> because they both cause the retinal to change shape and thus trigger the same impulse. For the brain to see colour, it must compare the responses {{of two or more}} classes of cones containing different visual pigments, so the four pigments in birds give increased discrimination.|$|E

25|$|The {{scene is}} laid {{in a vast}} forest sacred to Diana, where Adonis (soprano en travesti), as a {{follower}} of the chaste goddess, abhors love as a terrible monster jeopardizing humans’ peace of mind, {{but at the same}} time complains about no longer feeling the lure of sylvan life. Cupid himself (soprano en travesti) descends into the forest and approaches Adonis in order to tear him from Diana and to hand him over to Venus, who is in love with him. When Venus (soprano) arrives upon the scene, she easily succeeds in getting the better of Adonis’ scruples and, supported by Cupid, they resolve to flee in order to shun Diana’s dreadful wrath. When Diana (soprano) enters the scene, she charges Cupid with the abduction of credulous Adonis and entreats vengeance of heaven and hell. Mercury (haute-contre) then descends onto the scene assuring the enraged goddess that Venus will return Adonis to her, and the goddess of love re-enters over a cloud accompanied by Cupid and Adonis disguised as Cupid, so that Diana cannot <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>apart.</b> Since Adonis refuses to reveal himself, Diana decides to withdraw for fear of possibly choosing Cupid, her bitterest enemy. The entrée goes on firstly to a ballet celebrating the coming wedding of Venus and Adonis, as in the distance Diana herself (ballerina) is shown to be falling in love with a sleeping Endymion (male dancer), and then to further more elaborate ballets representing Diana and Cupid’s(ballerina en travesti) meeting, Cupid's wakening Endymion and eventually Endymon's making love to Diana and his admission onto her cart. The entrée ends in a festive chorus accompanied by a general dance.|$|E

Soderbergh refused and proposed the script to other major Hollywood studios, but it was rejected because of the three-hour running time and the subject matter—Traffic {{is more of a}} political film than most Hollywood productions. USA Films, however, liked the project from the start and offered the filmmakers more money than Fox.

[...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times thought that Cruise gave [...] "a fine, typically energetic performance in a film that requires nothing more of him than a profile and vigor" [...] but that von Stauffenberg was too complex a character to adequately portray in a film designed as a thriller. Dargis also wrote of the director's excess, [...] "Though Mr. Singer's old-fashioned movie habits, his attention to the gloss, gleam and glamour of the image, can be agreeably pleasurable, he tends to gild every lily," [...] citing as an example the [...] "spooky music" [...] and [...] "low camera angles" [...] in the meeting between Hitler and von Stauffenberg. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times also found Cruise [...] "perfectly satisfactory, if not electrifying, in the leading role", believing that the portrayal fit the [...] "veterans of officer rank" [...] that would not panic under fire; Ebert recognizes that [...] "Singer ... works heroically to introduce us to the major figures in the plot, to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>apart,</b> to explain their roles and to suggest their differences." ...|$|E

[...] Castiel refuses to help as he doesn't want to fight and after he disappears to retrieve a board game, Meg explains that since Castiel had the Leviathans within him, he is able to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>apart</b> even in their human forms and can pick out the real Dick Roman. [...] Castiel watches as Sam and Dean burn Bobby's flask and put him at rest and later takes Dean to where he has stored the Impala and agrees to help. [...] Castiel, Sam and Dean infiltrate Sucrocorp thanks to a distraction from Meg and he and Dean confront Dick Roman in the labs. [...] Dick throws Castiel across the room when he tries to attack, but after Dean fails to kill Dick, Castiel holds his head in place from behind allowing Dean to stab Dick through the neck with the weapon, killing him. As a result of this, Castiel and Dean are sucked into Purgatory with Dick's soul and after letting Dean know this and that {{they are more likely to}} die than get out, Castiel disappears, leaving Dean alone.|$|E

2500|$|From January 1953, {{owing to}} the Federal number plate system, Victorian plates {{switched}} to the three-letter, three-number standard: GAA-000 to HZZ-999, and JAA-000 to LZZ-999, coloured white lettering on a black background, and a [...] "Vic" [...] insert {{on the top of}} the plate. The first three-lettered plate, GAA-000 was issued on 27 January 1953. The letters [...] "I" [...] and [...] "Q" [...] were not issued in any combinations, due to these being easily mistaken for [...] "1" [...] and [...] "O" [...] or [...] "0". For the same reason, In 1964, Victoria skipped the I-prefix series and went straight from HZZ-999 to JAA-000.

5000|$|Beginning in the 1970s new {{insights}} into the socialist calculation debate emerged from mechanism design theory. According to mechanism design theorists, the debate between Hayek and Lange became a stalemate that lasted for forty years because neither side was speaking the same language as the other - partially because the appropriate language for discussing socialist calculation had not yet been invented. According to these theorists, what was needed was {{a better understanding of the}} informational problems that prevent coordination between people. By fusing game theory with information economics, mechanism design provided the language and framework in which both socialists and advocates of capitalism could compare the merits of their arguments. As Palda (2013) writes in his summary of the contributions of mechanism design to the socialist calculation debate, “It seemed that socialism and capitalism were good at different things. Socialism suffered from cheating, or 'moral hazard', more than capitalism because it did not allow company managers to own shares in their own companies... The flip side of the cheating problem in socialism is the lying or 'adverse selection' problem in capitalism. If potential firm managers are either good or bad, but <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>apart</b> is difficult, bad prospects will lie to become a part of the firm.” ...|$|R
