[...] The TUEL attempted to create an “amalgamation of the trade unions” by forging alliances, organizing unity conferences, winning control of different local unions as well as city and state labor federations. [...] The TUEL aimed to provide leadership for numerous local, as well as regional, industry-wide strikes. In 1928, the Communist International finally encouraged League members to abandon their “boring from within” strategy. In 1929, the TUEL {{gave way to the}} Trade Union Unity League (TUUL) and began to establish new unions. The TUUL founded about a dozen industrial unions in various economic sectors including textiles, marine labor, mining, shoe and leather manufacturing, and agricultural labor. Soon after the founding of the TUUL, approximately 50, 000 workers were organized by TUUL affiliates.|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{the number}} of {{industrial}} disputes fell, while inflation was brought under control. In the lead up to the 1984 budget, unions agreed to a wage/tax trade-off in which they forewent an indexed wage increase {{in return for a}} tax cut geared towards low and middle-income earners. Job protection, family leave, and a standard 38-hour workweek had been extended to most workers, whose living standards were protected via superannuation, social wage improvements, and tax cuts. Union members (and indeed, non-union members who were nonetheless covered by union-negotiated collective agreements) and their families benefited from lower inflation, more jobs, maternity allowances, family leave, <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>education,</b> improved access to education, Medicare, superannuation, higher pensions, occupational health and safety improvements, family income supplements, and regular real wage increases from 1991 onwards (after having fallen under Hawke). Collective bargaining rights were enhanced, while an effective minimum wages system was sustained. By 1991, the lowest paid workers received additional increases through the mechanism of supplementary payments. It is arguable that most Australians were a little better off materially {{on the eve of the}} 1991 recession than in 1983.

Free tertiary education was introduced, together with a universal health care system and a sole parent pension. Laws were also passed providing for equal pay for women and national land rights, divorce laws were made more liberal, and legislation against racial discrimination was introduced. In addition, the principle of equal pay was extended, {{occupational health and safety}} was improved, annual leave loading was introduced, <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>education</b> was established, four weeks of annual leave was achieved as a national standard, military conscription was abolished and Australian troops were withdrawn from Vietnam, a separate ministry responsible for Aboriginal affairs was established, controls on foreign ownership of Australian resources were put in place, laws against sexual discrimination were passed, maternity leave and benefits for single mothers were extended, an attempt was made to democratise the electoral system through the introduction of one-vote-one-value, and a Community Health Program was introduced. The social services were also significantly expanded, with big improvements in the real value of social security payments, spending on housing quadrupled, education outlays doubled, and federal health expenditure rising by 20% A Department of Aboriginal Affairs was also established, while Australia’s first federal legislation on human rights, the environment and heritage was initiated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The survey of students attending day-release in Autumn 1977 (Study number 1234) lacked any explanatory power of why individuals in the target audience who {{were aware of the}} Trade Union Studies Project and/or had seen some publicity decided not to become involved. This sort of problem became more relevant as it became increasingly obvious that the Project was not attracting the numbers of students that its originators had envisaged. The research project had, at the beginning of 1978, only surveyed representatives who were currently experiencing a particular kind of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>education</b> and were thus, presumably, already effectively tied in to the publicity network. This not only left out representatives who had not experienced <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>education</b> but also branch officials and other active trade unionists who do not actually hold representative posts entitling them to paid educational leave for T. U. C. courses. Reaching this group became even more imperative as time wore on and growing contacts with lay representatives made it more obvious that their attitudes to <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>education</b> in general and 'own-time' study in particular would be significant in evaluating the 'penetration' of the Project. The 'penetration' survey, then, was used both to get such basic information and to structure a discussion at branch and other trade union representative meetings. Main Topics : The questionnaire asked whether people had any experience of <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>education</b> and, if so, what kind, i. e. postal course, day release, in plant etc., and their general attitudes to <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>education.</b> It sought their knowledge of and involvement in the Project; asked which kinds of courses they preferred to attend, and checked how far they would be prepared to study in the way demanded by 'Trade Union Studies'...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] The Education Advisory Committee, {{the longest}} {{standing}} {{committee of the}} Canadian Labor Congress, met in 1994 to deliberate on issues of vital importance {{to the future of}} <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>education</b> within the Canadian labor movement. At the time, the participants did not realize that their deliberations would determine our movement 2 ̆ 7 s direction in education until the year 2000. Discussions ranged from how we can coordinate the development and sharing of education materials, offer more schools and educational activities, use new technology in the area of distance education, and build more resources to further our education work. In the course of the discussions, the question of who we were reaching emerged as the major theme. The discussion document entitled, Why We Educate summed up the discussions this way: 2 ̆ 2 [...] . <b>Trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>education</b> has historically targeted the local union leadership and activists through a myriad of educational institutes and schools. Once back in the workplace it was anticipated that this group would share its knowledge and skills. After years of trade union institute training, {{the time has come to}} broaden the target group and take labor 2 ̆ 7 s message beyond our traditional arenas for education. 2 ̆ 2 Union leaders and activists must take responsibility for undertaking the <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> <b>education</b> of the non-activist members in the local. This will require the education community of the labor movement to gear some of its resources toward coordination with other trade union services such as communications and research, but also to change some of the focus at its institutional schools to providing participants with the tools for education in the local union and workplace. 2 ̆...|$|E
