5|$|In 1938 Los Angeles, two gangsters in Eddie Valentine's gang steal {{a rocket}} pack from Howard Hughes. During their escape, they find {{themselves}} on an airfield, where they hide <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> pack, ending in an auto-airplane accident while escaping, with the police in hot pursuit. Stunt pilot Cliff Secord's Gee Bee racer is totaled during the accident; he and airplane mechanic Peevy later find <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> pack hidden in a biplane cockpit. Movie star Neville Sinclair had hired Valentine's gang to steal <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> pack, and he sends his monstrous henchman Lothar to question the injured getaway driver, who tells him that <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> pack is at the airfield.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} level, <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> stays {{assembled}} and just requires refuelling. However, every four levels, <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> resets (giving the player an extra life) and the replacement {{has to be}} built {{before it can be}} re-fuelled for take off. Each new model has a new design with a higher number written on it, although the gameplay remains unchanged. The enemies change forms each level (cycling back to the first after eight levels) and each alien has a different pattern of movement which means they can be dealt with in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consultant}} to American Science and Engineering, Inc., Rossi initiated <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> experiments that discovered the first extra-solar source of X-rays, Scorpius X-1. Rossi was made Institute Professor at MIT in 1966.|$|E

5|$|At Sinclair's home, Jenny {{discovers that}} he is a Nazi secret agent and knocks him out. She is later {{detained}} and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Hughes and Peevy, Cliff hides <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> pack. Hughes explains that his rocket pack is a prototype, similar to one that Nazi scientists have, up to now, been unsuccessful in developing, and shows them a horrifying propaganda film that reveals the scope of the Nazis' plans, depicting an army of flying soldiers invading the United States. The FBI agents mention that they are tracking a Nazi spy in Hollywood, whom Cliff realizes to be Sinclair. When Hughes demands the return of <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> pack, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes, inadvertently leaving behind a clue to where he is headed.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Chiswick {{was bombed}} repeatedly, with both {{incendiary}} and high explosive bombs. Falling anti-aircraft shells and shrapnel also caused damage. The first V-2 rocket to hit London fell on Staveley Road, Chiswick, at 6.43pm on 8 September 1944, killing three people, injuring 22 others and causing extensive damage to surrounding trees and buildings. Six houses were demolished by <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> {{and many more}} suffered damage.

25|$|He {{ultimately}} {{opted not}} {{to play in the}} NFL, instead playing for <b>the</b> Chicago <b>Rockets</b> of <b>the</b> All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Hirsch chose <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> because they were coached by Dick Hanley, who had been Hirsch's coach with the El Toro Marines team. Hirsch played three seasons with <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> from 1946 to 1948. During those three years, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> compiled a 7–32 record and won only one game in each of the 1947 and 1948 seasons. Hirsch later said the decision to sign with <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> was <b>the</b> worst decision he ever made.|$|R
50|$|In 1971 {{the army}} {{comprised}} <b>the</b> 36th Guards <b>Rocket</b> Division (Krasnoyarsk, Krasnoyarsk Kray); <b>the</b> 39th Guards <b>Rocket</b> Division (Pashino, Novosibirsk Oblast); <b>the</b> 41st Guards <b>Rocket</b> Division (Aleysk, Altai Kray); <b>the</b> 57th <b>Rocket</b> Division (Zhangiz Tobe, Semipalatinsk Oblast); <b>the</b> 62nd <b>Rocket</b> Division (Uzhur, Krasnoyarsk Kray); <b>the</b> 93rd <b>Rocket</b> Brigade (Tyumen, Tyumen Oblast); <b>the</b> 97th <b>Rocket</b> Brigade (Itatka, Tomsk Oblast); and <b>the</b> 290th Independent <b>Rocket</b> Regiment (Omsk, Omsk Oblast). <b>The</b> 290th Independent <b>Rocket</b> Regiment and <b>the</b> 93rd <b>Rocket</b> Brigade were disbanded in 1976.|$|R

5|$|Leo {{intends to}} kill Quatermass {{to prevent the}} {{destruction}} of the asteroid, and also to allow the ammonids to travel back to Earth en masse in the Quatermass II. He tries to kill Quatermass with a gun, but the recoil sends him floating helplessly off into space. Quatermass returns to <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> and jettisons the nuclear motor, then flies <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> back to earth as the motor blows up the asteroid, killing the remaining ammonids and relinquishing control over Dillon and all the 'marked' humans, returning mankind to its former freedom.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{bright spots}} in this stretch was Iginla, who {{captured}} <b>the</b> <b>Rocket</b> Richard and Art Ross Trophies in 2001–02 as NHL goal- and point-scoring champion after scoring 52 goals and 96 points. Iginla again won <b>the</b> <b>Rocket</b> Richard Trophy, tied with Rick Nash and Ilya Kovalchuk, with 41 goals in 2003–04. Another bright spot for the team during this time was defenceman Robyn Regehr who became the youngest nominee ever for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, which recognizes perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey. Regehr had suffered two broken legs {{in a car accident}} the summer of 1999, but recovered in time to play 57 games at the age of 19.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} three seasons, <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> were {{eliminated}} three straight times {{in the first round}} of the playoffs, with the first of those in 1988, the Dallas Mavericks defeating <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> in four games, leading to Fitch's dismissal. Don Chaney was hired to replace him and lead <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> to <b>the</b> playoffs in his first season in Houston, losing to the Seattle SuperSonics in four games thanks to a buzzer-beater that ended <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> season.|$|R
50|$|Amstutz's tenure {{started with}} a bang, with <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> winning at least eight games in each of Amstutz's first five seasons. <b>The</b> <b>Rockets</b> made <b>the</b> Motor City Bowl in Amstutz's first two seasons, winning the first then losing the second. The 2006, 2007 and 2008 seasons were different, though, as <b>the</b> <b>rockets</b> slid to records of 5-7, 5-7 and 3-9 in those years. However, in 2008, <b>The</b> <b>Rockets</b> upset Michigan in Ann Arbor by a score of 13-10. <b>The</b> <b>Rockets</b> are <b>the</b> first and only MAC Team to beat Michigan. Amstutz {{resigned}} as head coach following the 2008 season. His final record was 58-41.|$|R

5|$|Sinclair sends Lothar to Cliff and Peevy's {{home to find}} <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> pack. The FBI arrives, but Cliff and Peevy escape, while Lothar steals its {{detailed}} schematics {{drawn up}} by Peevy. Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy are trapped by several Valentine mobsters; they learn that Jenny had a date with Sinclair, and of the actor's involvement {{in the hunt for}} <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> pack. The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, while a bullet ricochet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum. Cliff proceeds to the South Seas Club, where he tells Jenny about his new alter ego. The Valentine gang arrives, and Jenny is kidnapped by Sinclair in the ensuing melée.|$|E
5|$|The Dnepr rocket {{assigned}} to launch CryoSat-2 {{arrived at the}} Baikonur Cosmodrome by train on 29 December 2009. On 12 January 2010, the first two stages of <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> were loaded into the launch canister, and the canister was prepared for transportation to the launch site. On 14 January, it was rolled out to Site 109/95, where it was installed into its silo. The next day saw the third stage transported to the silo, and installed atop <b>the</b> <b>rocket.</b>|$|E
5|$|The nose cone, which {{contained}} the ordnance that would impact the target, would separate from <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> booster. This made <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> lighter as only the nose cone and its ordnance {{had to be}} able to survive re-entry, rather than <b>the</b> <b>rocket.</b> The unique innovations of the Hiroc missiles, such as the gimballed engines, and the internally supported frame, would go on to inspire the Atlas rockets. Several things changed however, such as the aluminum used for the missiles skin of the Hiroc, was switched out for stainless steel in the Atlas, because stainless steel had a higher melting point. The engines of the Atlas missiles were also much stronger, generating a total of 150,000 pounds-force (667,000 Newtons), compared to the Hiroc's total of 8,000 pounds-force (35,585 Newtons).|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rockets</b> rode at <b>the</b> stadium until 1973 {{when it was}} {{announced}} that the stadium had been sold to developers and <b>the</b> <b>Rockets</b> would need to find a new home.

5|$|When Quatermass and {{his team}} reach the crash area and succeed in opening <b>the</b> <b>rocket,</b> they {{discover}} that {{only one of the}} three crewmen, Victor Carroon, remains inside. Quatermass and his chief assistant Paterson (Hugh Kelly) investigate the interior of <b>the</b> <b>rocket,</b> and are baffled by what they find: the space suits of the others are present, and the instruments on board indicate that the door was never opened in flight, but {{there is no sign of}} the other two crewmen.|$|E
5|$|While {{watching}} a 1950s science fiction movie, Bart and Lisa see {{a commercial for}} a model rocket kit and Bart orders it by using Homer's credit card number. Homer helps Bart and Milhouse build it, but it blows up before launching. Jealous that Ned Flanders built a superior rocket, Homer enlists {{the help of his}} former nerdy college roommates, Gary, Doug, and Benjamin, to build a rocket piloted by the hamster Nibbles. <b>The</b> <b>rocket</b> lifts off successfully, but it develops complications and Nibbles bails out. However, Homer makes an attempt to shoot down <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> with a 12 gauge shotgun, but <b>the</b> <b>rocket</b> crashes into the church. The church council meets up to decide how to come up with money to fund the repairs to the church, and with no other aid available they accept help from Mr. Burns and Lindsay Naegle who wish to run the church as a business. The two rebuild the church as a commercial monstrosity, complete with advertising signs, a Lard Lad statue, and a Jumbotron. Lisa is appalled at this and abandons the church, feeling her religion has lost its soul.|$|E
