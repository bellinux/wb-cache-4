However, since {{only the top}} two scores from each category count towards the team's total score, a team can compete with as few as six students without any point deduction.

5000|$|The Instructions of Shuruppak (or, Instructions of Šuruppak son of Ubara-tutu) are a {{significant}} example of Sumerian wisdom literature. Wisdom literature, intended to teach proper piety, inculcate virtue, and preserve community standards, was common throughout the ancient Near East. The text is set in great antiquity by its incipit: [...] "In <b>those</b> days, <b>in</b> <b>those</b> far remote times, <b>in</b> <b>those</b> nights, <b>in</b> <b>those</b> faraway nights, <b>in</b> <b>those</b> years, <b>in</b> <b>those</b> far remote years."

Ubara-Tutu is recorded in most extant copies of the Sumerian king list as being the final king of Sumer prior to the deluge. Grouped with the other cuneiform tablets from Abu Salabikh, the Instructions date to the early third millennium BC, being among the oldest surviving literature.|$|R
