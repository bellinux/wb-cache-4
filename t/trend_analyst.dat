40|$|In 1997, {{business}} <b>trend</b> <b>analyst</b> Linda Stone {{proposed the}} term "continuous partial attention" to characterise the contemporary experience {{of wanting to}} be ‘a live node on the network’. She argued that while {{it can be a}} positive and functional behaviour, it also {{has the potential to be}} disabling, compromising reflective and creative thought. Subsequent studies have explored the ways in which technology has slowly disrupted the idea and experience of a "centred" and "bounded" self. Studies of ‘Gen Y’ show the ease with which young people accommodate this multiplying of the self as they negotiate their partial friendships and networks of interest with family and work. In teaching and learning circles in tertiary education we talk a lot about problems of student ‘disengagement’. In characterising our challenge this way, are we undermining our potential to understand the tendencies of contemporary learners? This paper begins a consideration of how traditional models, frameworks and practices might oppose these partially engaged but continuously connected and interpersonal "dividuals". What questions does this provoke for learning environments towards harnessing yet counterpointing the crisis students might experience; to recognise but also integrate their multiple selves towards what they aim to become through the process of learning...|$|E

40|$|The brief was {{to produce}} a range of {{affordable}} and functional products for everyday use. Research undertaken {{in response to the}} brief significantly addressed the needs of the consumer. The range was designed so that it could be manufactured across a number of factories: Greece, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Vietnam and China, thus, allowing the volumes to be achieved without completely overrunning one factory with one range. The designing of each article considered the most effective production method. Also stacking of each product was a necessary part of the design brief, this facilitates ease of storage and transportation. Stacking of objects is particularly challenging but necessary for economic and environmental policies. The range also offers the same design in a number of materials: stoneware, earthenware, and glass and a number of glaze and/or glass colours and patterns. This provides different price points and also a variety of aesthetics and consumer choice. The overall aesthetic is clean-cut, which provides simplicity and easy accessibility for the consumer but also a plain surface for the addition of pattern. A workshop with Kevin Gould, the chef, food critic and food <b>trend</b> <b>analyst,</b> enabled design teams to assess current food trends helpful to designing products appropriate to the food customers are buying. Research showed that although traditional and cultural dishes remained a mainstay in consumers’ eating habits, there was a predominant demand for pasta, pizza, rice and noodle dishes particularly Indian and Thai curry. Consumers were also seeking tableware to reflect the trans-cultural character of these dishes: large 30 cm flat pizza plates, generous pasta bowls, deep bowls for noodles, and square and rectangular dishes to mimic Oriental styles. Further research into market and product availability at major international trade fairs allowed us to assess the gaps in the current market.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} trend {{analysis}} and trends in general {{as a means}} of helping organizations to get insight of futures. Trends are looked at from a client’s point of view as well as {{the point of view of}} a professional <b>trend</b> <b>analyst.</b> Having worked with trends for years in many fields from fashion designer to a journalist and a lecturer specializing in futures trends, I have had the opportunity to observe the field from many different angles. The field of trend research and analysis is vast and overflowing with information. A trend can be anything from a fashion trend to a social trend or a megatrend. The work for this thesis has been conducted using several methods; discussions with the management of organizations, trend professionals, students and others interested in trends. I have interviewed trend analysts and participated in trend seminars and design fairs around the world. Theoretical literature and relevant articles have been looked into. Finally, students have been questioned to gain more information needed for this study. Furthermore, I have observed and scanned for changes, the crucial elements of emerging trends. The research questions of this study are: 1. What is the current understanding of trends? 2. Why is it difficult to understand trends and utilize them? 3. How could trends be translated into a more concrete form so that they would be of better use for people/ organizations? Can visuality be of help here? My conclusions are that the field of trends is very broad, context bound, heterogeneous and vague. Even theoretical books and articles use different terminology when they are referring to same matters and vice versa. It has been a surprise to notice how difficult it is even for the management in the design field to understand trends, what they are and where they come from. The contextual review pointed out how highly fragmented and controversial the field is. Trend analysis professionals and strategists are aware of that and therefore actions have been taken to clarify the language, as well as methods of trend research and analysis via networking. There are hunches and tacit knowledge always involved in analyzing trends, obviously solid data from the futures cannot exist, that probably adds to the confusion and adds suspicions towards the subject. Trends need systemic translating by a professional to be understood, not everyone can be or even become a trendspotter. Explaining trends with a broader context to other fields i. e. social, political and financial, helps to gain insight to the matter. Giving existing benchmarks from various fields backing an idea of a useful trend is also a good tool to make trends concrete and more comprehensive. Using visuality; moodboards, pictures and infographics linked with the articulated trend is a crucial element of understanding and making use of them. Last but not least, for an organization to utilize trends, trust is what is needed from the management. Intangible and tacit knowledge are an inseparable part of dealing with the futures, as there is no data available. There is always an element of risk involved when dealing with the possible futures...|$|E

Not only is the “national security community” a massive, complicated, and heterogeneous set of institutions, but its members are responsible for providing timely and trustworthy assessments of significant <b>trends.</b> <b>Analysts</b> are taught to think critically about the data and information they are examining, as well as the cognitive biases they bring to its interpretation. Critical thinking and skepticism often extend to innovative and exotic technologies, such as new informatics tools, particularly those developed outside the analytic workplace.

5000|$|Mainly {{it is used}} as a {{proppant}} transport / proppant {{suspending agent}} in hydraulic fracturing. In 2012 guar prices increased by 900-1000%. At its peak it reached to $28000 per ton. however later stabilised to $8000 per ton. The main reason for this large scale price rise was the inventory build up by companies like Halliburton and Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, Calfrac Well Services, amidst the fear of shortage of guar gum for drilling due to ongoing drought in Rajasthan. 2013 was a strong year for guar sowing and production in India. The total sowing area rose by 21 percent in 2013 to reach 10.6 million acres. Rajasthan, Haryana, and Gujarat - the three key guar-producing states - exceeded the sowing area target set by their respective agriculture departments. Non-traditional guar cultivators in other Indian states also showed keen interest in the crop in 2013.Calgary-based Trican Well Services Ltd. touts its trademarked guar substitutes TriFrac-C and Novum.

For the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) to perform research with the world's largest and most complex machine, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), Grid computing was developed to handle the information created. In accordance with the mandate of CERN Technology Transfer (TT) group, this thesis {{is a part of}} CERN's dissemination of the Grid technology. The thesis gives a brief overview of the use of the Grid technology and where it is heading. IT <b>trend</b> <b>analysts</b> and large-scale IT vendors see this technology as key in transforming the world of IT. They predict that in a matter of years, IT will be bought as a service, instead of a good. Commoditization of IT, delivered as a service, is a paradigm shift that will have a broad impact on all parts of the IT market, {{as well as on the}} society as a whole. Political, economic and physical factors advocate a market for standardized computing resources supplied by multiple professional providers, benefiting from economies of scale. We argue for the trade of Virtual Servers as the standardized bundle of computer resources. Continuous trade of homogeneous resources allows for scheduling market efficiency and liquidity, but may entail a risk of erratic, unpredictable prices. We therefor e construct a complete, coherent Grid economy, consisting of both a spot market and a derivatives market. While the spot market is the trading place for the computer resources, the derivatives market aims to disperse the risk among those who are willing to invest in it. Because the Virtual Servers are non-storable assets, normal arbitrage theory cannot be used to price derivatives contracts. We propose to solve this issue by creating storable swap contracts priced by an auction-based market, where we argue that the price process follows a geometric Brownian motion. Taking into account the absence of arbitrage in the swap market and the requirement for a complete market, we offer a theoretical framework for martingale pricing and hedging of derivatives written on swaps...|$|R

40|$|As {{opposed to}} {{fundamental}} analysis, financial chartism (or technical analysis) {{is based on}} the assumption that future movements of a traded asset can be inferred from past regularities. In spite, or maybe by virtue of its lack of scientific grounds, it enjoys an ever-growing popularity among amateur traders, as countless websites provide free, simple and powerful tools for making professional-looking charts and even automate the detection of <b>trends.</b> Though technical <b>analysts</b> account for the validity of chart patterns in terms of market psychology, constructivist explanations also abound among trading communities: it is all as if economic agents reflexively used technical analysis as a means of coordination on the market. Markers like moving averages and trend lines serve as self-referent indicators whose efficacy only gets reinforced as more agents use it as pivotal points. Performativity is the technical analyst’s most natural language: explicit mentions to mechanisms such as the self-fulfilling prophecy or the Keynesian beauty contest are the only justifications s/he needs. Some chartists even claim their discipline does not contradict the efficient-market hypothesis: if prices already reflect all past publicly available information, one may skip the hassle of dissecting balance sheets or mastering pricing models, focusing instead on candlestick or diagram patterns which, by conjecture, contain all the necessary information to explain price movements. Drawing on the comparative analysis of nonprofessional trading blogs, our paper examines how these major epistemic modes of justification of technical analysis have come to support each other, in a context of proliferation of charting tools...|$|R
