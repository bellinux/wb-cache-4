5|$|Helicoverpa zea {{has a wide}} host range, attacking {{vegetables}} that include corn, tomato, artichoke, asparagus, cabbage, cantaloupe, collards, cowpea, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, lima bean, melon, okra, pea, pepper, potato, pumpkin, snap bean, spinach, squash, sweet potato, and watermelon. However, {{not all of these}} are good hosts. While corn and lettuce are shown to be great hosts, <b>tomatoes</b> <b>are</b> less beneficial, and broccoli and cantaloupe are poor hosts. Corn and sorghum are most favored by corn earworms. Various signs reveal the presence of these moths. Young maize crops have holes in their leaves, following whorl-feeding on the apical leaf. Eggs can be found on silks on larger plants, and silks display grazing evidence. The soft, milky grains in the top few centimeters of corn cobs are eaten as the corn ears develop. One larva per cob can be observed. Bore holes are observed in cabbage and lettuce hearts, flower heads, cotton bolls, and tomato fruits. Sorghum heads are grazed, and legume pod seeds are eaten.|$|E

The crops now are rice in rainy season and butter beans otherwise, though with a more diverse population a few vegetables such as eggplant and <b>tomatoes</b> <b>are</b> grown. Farmers here have to protect their crops from wild elephants, gaur, wild boar, deer and sometimes peacocks.

500|$|In {{everyday}} language, {{the words}} [...] "fruit" [...] and [...] "vegetable" [...] are mutually exclusive. [...] "Fruit" [...] has a precise botanical meaning, {{being a part}} that developed from the ovary of a flowering plant. This is considerably different from the word's culinary meaning. While peaches, plums, and oranges are [...] "fruit" [...] in both senses, many items commonly called [...] "vegetables", such as eggplants, bell peppers, and <b>tomatoes,</b> <b>are</b> botanically fruits. The {{question of whether the}} tomato is a fruit or a vegetable found its way into the United States Supreme Court in 1893. The court ruled unanimously in Nix v. Hedden that a tomato is correctly identified as, and thus taxed as, a vegetable, {{for the purposes of the}} Tariff of 1883 on imported produce. The court did acknowledge, however, that, botanically speaking, a tomato is a fruit.|$|E
500|$|Gumbo can be {{made with}} or without okra or filé powder. The {{preferred}} method in the historical New Orleans variation is with a French dark roux. The flavor of the dish has its origins in many cultures. [...] Creole gumbo generally contains shellfish, and a dark roux, filé, or both. <b>Tomatoes</b> <b>are</b> not traditionally found in Creole gumbo, but do appear in New Orleans cuisine. Cajun gumbo is generally based on a dark roux and is made with shellfish or fowl. Sausage or ham is often added to gumbos of either variety. After the base is prepared, vegetables are cooked down, and then meat is added. The dish simmers for a minimum of three hours, with shellfish and some spices added near the end. If desired, filé powder is added after the pot is removed from heat. Gumbo is traditionally served over rice. A third, lesser-known variety, the meatless gumbo z'herbes, is essentially a gumbo of slow-cooked greens.|$|E

In Chinese cuisine, a soup known as , or [...] "Russian soup", is based on red cabbage and tomatoes, and lacks beetroots altogether; also known as [...] "Chinese borscht", it originated in Harbin, close to the Russian border in northeast China, and has spread as far as Hong Kong.

Gerard knew the <b>tomato</b> <b>was</b> eaten in Spain and Italy. Nonetheless, he believed it was poisonous (in fact, the plant and raw fruit do have low levels of tomatine, but are not generally dangerous; see below).

2500|$|Justice Gray, citing several Supreme Court cases (Brown v. Piper, , , and Jones v.

In this case dictionaries cannot be admitted as evidence, but only as aids to the memory and understanding of the court. Gray acknowledged that botanically, <b>tomatoes</b> <b>are</b> classified as a [...] "fruit of the vine"; nevertheless, they are seen as vegetables because they were usually eaten as a main course instead of being eaten as a dessert. In making his decision, Justice Gray mentioned another case where it had been claimed that beans were seeds [...] Justice Bradley, in Robertson v. Salomon, 130 U.S. 412, 414, similarly found that though a bean is botanically a seed, in common parlance a bean is seen as a vegetable. While on the subject, Gray clarified the status of the cucumber, squash, pea, and bean.|$|E
