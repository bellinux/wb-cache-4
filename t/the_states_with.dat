5|$|A further {{distinction}} {{is the number}} of chambers in the national legislature; unicameral systems with one chamber or bicameral ones with a lower house and an upper house. Federations and countries with strong regional differences or regional identities are normally bicameral, to reflect the regions' interests in national bills. <b>The</b> <b>states</b> <b>with</b> the larger populations, from the Netherlands upwards, all have a bicameral system. Although there is a greater mix among the smaller states (some influenced by their federalist structure), the smallest states are on the whole unicameral.|$|E
5|$|Each {{state has}} a unicameral State Legislative Assembly whose members are elected from {{single-member}} constituencies. State governments are led by Chief Ministers, who are state assembly members from the majority party in the assembly. In each of <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>with</b> a hereditary ruler, the Chief Minister is normally required to be a Malay, appointed by the ruler upon {{the recommendation of the}} Prime Minister. Parliamentary elections are held at least once every five years, the most recent of which took place in May 2013. Registered voters of age 21 and above may vote for the members of the House of Representatives and, in most of the states, for the state legislative chamber. Voting is not mandatory. Except for state elections in Sarawak, by convention state elections are held concurrently with the federal election.|$|E

The Atlas lists the United States membership of the OCA as 84,900, 33,800 of which it says are regular church attendees.

5|$|Though never {{believed}} to be common, pallid sturgeon populations rapidly declined during the late 20th century and the species was listed as endangered on September 6, 1990. The U.S. government and most of <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>with</b> pallid sturgeon populations have commenced restoration efforts to save the species from extinction. Wild reproduction of pallid sturgeon is rare to nonexistent in most areas; therefore, human intervention is needed to ensure {{the survival of the}} species. Pallid sturgeon were previously considered a prized trophy game fish species, until their numbers declined and they were placed on the endangered species list. All captured pallid sturgeon must now be released back to the wild. The species was known for being very palatable and the roe from females was used as caviar.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{description of the}} phase dynamics and its corresponding electrodynamics in a stack of inductively coupled intrinsic Josephson junctions of layered high-$T_c$ superconductors {{in the absence of}} an external magnetic field. Depending on the spatial structure of the gauge invariant phase difference, <b>the</b> dynamic <b>state</b> is classified into: <b>state</b> <b>with</b> kink, <b>state</b> without kink, and <b>state</b> <b>with</b> solitons. It is revealed that in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>with</b> phase kink, <b>the</b> plasma is coupled to the cavity and the plasma oscillation is enhanced. In contrast, in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> without kink, <b>the</b> plasma oscillation is weak. It points a way to enhance the radiation of electromagnetic from high-$T_c$ superconductors. We also perform numerical simulations to check the theory and a good agreement is achieved. The radiation pattern of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>with</b> and without kink is calculated, which may serve as a fingerprint of <b>the</b> dynamic <b>state</b> realized by <b>the</b> system.
