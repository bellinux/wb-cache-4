5|$|A {{variation}} on <b>this</b> <b>theme</b> were oil-lamp clocks. These early timekeeping devices {{consisted of a}} graduated glass reservoir to hold oil — usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly — supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp. As the level in the reservoir dropped, it provided a rough measure of the passage of time.|$|E

5|$|Alongside {{the idea}} of the greater Elves, Tolkien also {{developed}} {{the idea of}} children visiting Valinor, the island-homeland of the Elves in their sleep. Elves would also visit children at night and comfort them if they had been chided or were upset. <b>This</b> <b>theme,</b> linking elves with children's dreams and nocturnal travelling was largely abandoned in Tolkien's later writing.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} have described rationalisation {{and the question}} of individual freedom in an increasingly rational society, as the main theme of Weber's work. <b>This</b> <b>theme</b> was situated in the larger context of the relationship between psychological motivations, cultural values and beliefs (primarily, religion) and the structure of the society (usually determined by the economy).|$|E
5|$|Nor is <b>this</b> <b>theme</b> of {{cutthroat}} competition {{limited to}} prestidigitation: the script incorporates the popular notion that Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison were directly {{engaged in the}} War of Currents, a rivalry over electrical standards, which appears in the film in parallel to Angier and Borden's competition for magical supremacy. In the book, Tesla and Edison serve as foils for Angier and Borden, respectively.|$|E
40|$|<b>This</b> <b>themed</b> {{issue of}} the New Review of Academic Librarianship is documenting the {{extended}} role of academic libraries (and their staff) in developing and supporting students across the entire student lifecycle – from pre-entry, to post qualification. The resulting innovative approaches mean working with a much wider range of stakeholders than previously, internally and externally and involving students more pro-actively.

The papers presented here provide {{a wide range of}} new evidence on homelessness including theoretical, methodological and empirical contributions. They draw on a range of national experiences in Europe and beyond, and addressing the issue of social inclusion and social exclusion of homeless or previously homeless people from a range of perspectives and approaches.

50|$|It {{is in this}} {{conclusion}} that Liszt reintroduces each theme from the piece, beginning with the funeral march <b>theme,</b> <b>this</b> time more powerful and emphatic. He then briefly reiterates parts of the A♭-major theme before bringing back the left-hand octave-driven warrior march. However, rather than allowing <b>this</b> <b>theme's</b> intensity to take control again, he limits its duration and ends the piece with a sudden drop into quiet, open staccatissimo chords.|$|R
5|$|The {{series has}} also {{produced}} some special editions featuring contestants from a preexisting rivalry. These episodes have included competitions between USC and UCLA graduates, {{as well as}} an Election Day special between pairs of Democrats and Republicans. <b>This</b> <b>theme</b> was revived with a special episode entitled Political Idiotest, which both taped and aired April 20, 2016, and featured brain teasers referring to political subjects.|$|E
5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” <b>This</b> <b>theme</b> is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may be related to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E
5|$|Clark Gregg reprises {{his role}} as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. The episode adapts the {{character}} of Hall from the comics, portrayed by guest star Ian Hart, and introduces his gravitational technology based on the fictional element gravitonium, which was created by visual effects vendor FuseFX. The episode also introduces David Conrad as recurring villain Ian Quinn, with his own villainous musical theme; a variation of <b>this</b> <b>theme</b> is played on ethnic instruments to support the episode's Malta setting.|$|E
50|$|The ride's current queue {{bypasses}} most of <b>this</b> <b>theming.</b> It {{is located}} in the pathway between the original Lethal Weapon - The Ride entrance and Superman Escape. This results in a considerably shorter queue which originally made up just the last portion of the queue.|$|R

40|$|<b>This</b> <b>themed</b> {{issue of}} Land Use Policy builds mainly on papers {{presented}} {{at an international}} conference on 'Land Use Issues and Policy in China under Rapid Rural and Urban Transformation', convened by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China, in October 2012. The conference set out to share and promote new scientific findings {{from a range of}} disciplines that advance research on land use policy in China. The contributions to <b>this</b> <b>themed</b> issue provide conceptual-theoretical and empirical takes on the topic, around four main areas of interest to both researchers and policymakers: nation-wide land use issues, the Sloping Land Conversion Program, land engineering and land use, and land use transitions. Various land use issues have been associated with rapid urban-rural transformations in China, giving rise to formulation of new policies directly affecting land use. However, these have contributed to new land use problems {{due to the nature of}} the policies and the difficulties in policy implementation constrained by the special 'dual-track' structure of urban-rural development in China. In view of <b>this,</b> <b>this</b> <b>themed</b> edition makes a compelling call for more systematic research into the making and implementation of China's land use policy. It also emphasizes the challenges for further research on land use policy in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|I'll {{say that}} the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but {{pleasant}} because it brought satisfaction... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on <b>this</b> <b>theme,</b> but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the residential colleges, housing {{is available at the}} Village on the lower quarry, populated by continuing and transfer students (in 2016-17, this will be restricted to only continuing students); the Redwood Grove Apartments, which is available to continuing student applicants from all colleges; and the University Town Center, located downtown, that serves both continuing and transfer students. The Transfer Community is located in sections of both the A and B Buildings at Porter College and over 500 residents live within <b>this</b> <b>theme</b> housing. Graduate Student Housing is available near Science Hill, and UCSC also offers Family Student Housing units as well as a Camper Park for student-owned trailers and RVs.|$|E
5|$|The Region Cadet Leadership Schools (RCLS) provide {{training}} to increase knowledge, skills, and attitudes as they pertain to leadership and management. To {{be eligible to}} attend, cadets must be serving in, or preparing to enter, cadet leadership positions within their squadron. RCLSs are conducted at region level, or at wing level with region approval. The RCLS programs {{are more or less}} modeled on USAFA upper classmen programs, the college Air Force ROTC Professional Officer Course (POC) and latter stages of OTS. One variation on <b>this</b> <b>theme</b> are CAP Cadet Non-Commissioned Officer Schools and Academies, which are cadet NCO schools designed to teach basic leadership and principles to cadet leaders during their earlier duty positions in the cadet program.|$|E
40|$|Hospital-acquired {{infection}} (HAI) is {{an important}} public health issue with unacceptable levels of morbidity and mortality, over the last 5 years. Disease can be transmitted by air (over large distances), by direct/indirect contact {{or a combination of}} both routes. While contact transmission of disease forms the majority of HAI cases, transmission through the air is harder to control, but one where the engineering sciences can {{play an important role in}} limiting the spread. This forms the focus of <b>this</b> <b>themed</b> volume. In <b>this</b> paper, we describe the current hospital environment and review the contributions from microbiologists, mechanical and civil engineers, and mathematicians to <b>this</b> <b>themed</b> volume on the airborne transmission of infection in hospitals. The review also points out some of the outstanding scientific questions and possible approaches to mitigating transmission. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|The {{director}} filmed exterior {{scenes in}} Illinois {{in the winter}} and the spring of 2001, using real weather conditions such as snow, rain, and mud for the scenes. Mendes considered the usage of bleak weather conditions and the intended coldness of Gassner's exterior locations to define the characters' emotional states. Pullman became a key location to reflect <b>this</b> <b>theme,</b> having several settings, including the town's historic Florence Hotel, easily redressed by the crew for the film. Filming concluded in June 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} {{opens with}} the first violins stating the theme over a string and wind accompaniment. <b>This</b> <b>theme</b> consists of two eight-measure phrases, each repeated: the first phrase modulates from C minor to the dominant, G minor; the second phrase modulates back to C minor. The soloist does not play any part in the statement of the theme, entering only in Variation I. Here, the piano ornaments the theme over an austere string accompaniment.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} {{confusion}} appears through the transplantation of characters from one world to another, for example from the characters' childhood culture {{to the one}} imposed upon them as occurs in The Kingdom of This World. Often, the characters find that reality does not lie entirely in either world. It is possible that <b>this</b> <b>theme</b> is well-developed in Alejo Carpentier's work because of the author's own personal experience with cultural transplantation (Carpentier grew up in Havana but later moved to France for six years and travelled extensively).|$|E
