40|$|International audienceThe {{goal of the}} {{presented}} work {{is to use a}} low-dimensional {{control interface}} to control the high-DOF whole-body locomotion motion of a humanoid robot, for instance using a 2 D keyboard or joystick interface (up-down, left-right) to control a 30 DOF acyclic locomotion task (reaching a goal position by climbing on a stair). This work is motivated by the use of non-invasive BCI, which offers only such low-dimensional control signals, for low-level motion control of humanoids or exoskeletons in the assistive robotics domain of applications. The methodology is the following: given the target complex locomotion task, the humanoid autonomously plans the high-DOF motion and then executes it allowing the user to control on-line some low-dimensional features of the motion, namely way-points of the moving end-links. The approach is based on the two-stage contact-before-motion planning paradigm, which autonomously plans a sequence of <b>transition</b> <b>contacts</b> in its first stage, then executes the collision-free dynamics-consistent motion in the second stage, keeping dynamics balance of the motion.

40|$|A central {{quantity}} {{of importance for}} ultracold atoms is contact, which measures two-body correlations at short distances in dilute systems. It appears in universal relations among thermodynamic quantities, such as large momentum tails, energy, and dynamic structure factors, through the renowned Tan relations. However, a conceptual question remains open {{as to whether or}} not contact can signify phase transitions that are insensitive to short-range physics. Here we show that, near a continuous classical or quantum phase <b>transition,</b> <b>contact</b> exhibits a variety of critical behaviors, including scaling laws and critical exponents that are uniquely determined by the universality class of the phase transition and a constant contact per particle. We also use a prototypical exactly solvable model to demonstrate these critical behaviors in one-dimensional strongly interacting fermions.

By using a classical planning setup of A * together with a l 2 -norm heuristic, we demonstrate how the prior knowledge about object geometries can achieve near real-time performance in highly-cluttered environments, thereby not only outperforming the state-of-the-art algorithm, but also having a significantly lower model sparsity.

Single molecules {{are likely to}} be the smallest entities to conduct electricity and thus {{molecular wire}}s present many interesting challenges to fundamental science as well as enormous potential for nanoelectronic technological applications.

Spin-dependent transport mechanisms and device characteristics are explored for molecular wires with ferromagnetic iron contacts, systems that have not been considered previously, either theoretically or experimentally. Electron transport between iron point contacts bridged by iron atoms is also investigated. Spin-dependent transport is also studied for molecules bridging nickel contacts and a possible explanation of some experimentally observed phenomena is proposed.

Hertz's theory is recovered from their formulation if the adhesion of the materials is assumed to be zero. Similar to this theory, however using different assumptions, B. V. Derjaguin, V. M.
