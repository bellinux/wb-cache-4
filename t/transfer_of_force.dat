This results in a less abrupt <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> when a new pair of teeth come into play. With straight bevel gears, the abrupt tooth engagement causes noise, especially at high speeds, and impact stress on the teeth which makes them unable to take heavy loads at high speeds without breaking.

Force transmission across the cell-glial fiber interface sums over many individual N-cadherin/glial-fiber interactions, allowing required levels of traction force essential for migration. It {{has also been shown}} that these adhesive cadherin molecules are internalized, and recycled by the migratory neuron. This cadherin recycling mechanism is thought to be substantial in the neural adhesion-based migratory pathway.

40|$|We {{examined}} whether unilateral exercise creates perception {{bias in the}} non-exercised {{limb and}} ascertained whether rTMS applied to the primary motor cortex (M 1) interferes with this perception. All participants completed 4 interventions: 1) 15 - min learning period of intermittent isometric contractions at 35 % MVC with the trained hand (EX), 2) 15 -min learning period of intermittent isometric contractions at 35 % MVC with the trained hand whilst receiving rTMS over the contralateral M 1 (rTMS+EX); 3) 15 -min of rTMS over the ‘trained’ M 1 (rTMS) and 4) 15 -min rest (Rest). Pre and post-interventions, the error of force output production, the perception of effort (RPE), motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were measured in both hands. EX did not alter the error of force output production in the trained hand (D 3 %; P. 0. 05); however, the error of force output production was reduced in the untrained hand (D 12 %; P, 0. 05). rTMS+EX and rTMS alone did not show an attenuation in the error of force output production in either hand. EX increased RPE in the trained hand (9. 160. 5 vs. 11. 360. 7; P, 0. 01) but not the untrained hand (8. 860. 6 vs. 9. 260. 6; P. 0. 05). RPE was significantly higher after rTMS+EX in the trained hand (9. 260. 5 vs. 10. 760. 7; P, 0. 01) but ratings were unchanged in the untrained hand (8. 560. 6 vs. 9. 260. 5; P. 0. 05).

In order to determine the efficiency of oar blades in rowing, the fluid forces generated by the blade must be determined. Presented here is a new measurement system for the determination of these forces using quarter scale model oar blades in the controlled environment of a water flume. A quasi-static approach is employed, with the oar blade being held static at a range of angles relative to the fluid flow direction. The measured data were shown to be highly repeatable, and initial data suggested the importance of blade curvature in the generation of both lift and drag forces throughout the stroke...|$|E

Further improvement and development of geohodss of new generation are constrained for lack of design solutions as well as the methods for determination their main parameters, therefore this is an urgent task to carry out research in this field. As a result of research undertaken lay-out design solutions have been developed for the transmission of geohod on the basis of hydraulic cylinders operating in different phases [1, 2].

40|$|Abstract. Power {{supplies}} {{are often the}} limiting factor for operation of many portable electronic devices. Batteries contribute significantly to their weight and impose limitations on operational longevity. Harvesting vibratory energy from the environment for conversion to electrical energy has been proposed {{as a means to}} address these problems. Previously, DRDC Atlantic has shown that single crystals of nickel-manganese-gallium (NiMnGa) can produce large reversible stress-induced and magnetic field-induced strains of up to 10 %. It has been proposed that NiMnGa magnetic shape memory alloys may be an ideal alloy to harvest mechanical energy. The drawback to monolithic NiMnGa crystals is that they are susceptible to intergranular fracture. To address this issue, a composite of the alloy in a polymer matrix has been examined in the hopes of improving toughness and formability. Good bonding between the polymer and the powder is needed to facilitate optimum <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> between the two components. The objective {{of this study was to}} understand and optimize the polymer-alloy interactions. The polymer matrix chosen was Dow Corning Sylgard 186.

Developing synthetic materials with these properties {{is a significant}} challenge. Hydrogel composites made from high stiffness fabrics is a strategy to develop such unique materials; however, the ability to produce these materials has proven difficult, since common hydrogels swell in water and interact poorly with solid components, limiting the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>force</b> from the fabric to the hydrogel matrix. In this work, for the first time, we successfully produce extraordinarily tough hydrogel composites by strategically selecting a recently developed tough hydrogel that de-swells in water. The new composites, consisting of polyampholyte hydrogels and glass fiber woven fabrics, exhibit extremely high effective toughness (250 000 J m(- 2)), high tear strength (similar to 65 N mm(- 1)), high tensile modulus (606 MPa), and low bending modulus (4. 7 MPa). Even though these composites are composed of water-containing, biocompatible materials, their mechanical properties are comparable to high toughness Kevlar/polyurethane blends and fiber-reinforced polymers. Importantly, the mechanical properties of these composites greatly outperform the properties of either individual component. A mechanism is proposed based on established fabric tearing theory, which will enable {{the development of a}} new generation of mechanically robust composites based on fabrics. These results will be important towards developing soft biological prosthetics, and more generally for commercial applications such as tear-resistant gloves and bulletproof vests...|$|E

We hypothesized that intramuscular collagen content, collagen cross-linking and formation of advanced glycation endproducts of old individuals would be greater than young, and that intramuscular collagen content would be elevated following prolonged periods of unloading spanning 35, 60 and 90 days. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies revealed that intramuscular collagen (Young: 9. 6 ± 1. 1, Old: 10. 2 ± 1. 2 ug•mg muscle wet wf-') and collagen cross-links (hydroxylysylpyridinoline, HP) (Young: 395 ± 65, Old: 351 ± 45 mmol HP•mol collagen- 1) were unchanged (p> 0. 05) with aging. The advanced glycation endproduct, pentosidine, was increased (p 0. 05) following all time periods but was found to be elevated (p< 0. 05) in the soleus following 90 days of unloading. Furthermore, baseline collagen content was found to greater (p< 0. 05) in the soleus compared to the vastus lateralis. These results suggest the age related decline in whole muscle function is not related to increases in intramuscular collagen content or cross-linking but {{may be related to the}} accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts.

Elucidating how ECs sense flow is important for understanding both normal vascular function and disease. EC responses to FSS are mediated {{in part by a}} junctional mechanosensory complex consisting of VE-cadherin, PECAM- 1, and VEGFR 2 [2]. Previous work suggested that flow increases force on PECAM- 1, which initiates signaling [2 – 4]. Deletion of PECAM- 1 blocks responses to flow in vitro and flow-dependent vascular remodeling in vivo [2, 5]. To understand this process, we developed and validated FRET-based tension sensors for VE-cadherin and PECAM- 1 using our previously developed FRET tension biosensor [6]. FRET measurements showed that in static culture, VE-cadherin in cell-cell junctions bears significant myosin-dependent tension, whereas there was no detectable tension on VE-cadherin outside of junctions. Onset of shear stress triggered a rapid (< 30 s) decrease in tension across VE-cadherin, which paralleled a decrease in total cell-cell junctional tension. Flow triggered a simultaneous increase in tension across junctional PECAM- 1, while nonjunctional PECAM- 1 was unaffected. Tension on PECAM- 1 was mediated by flow-stimulated association with vimentin. These data confirm the prediction that shear increases force on PECAM- 1.
