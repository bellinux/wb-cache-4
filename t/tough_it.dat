25|$|The {{amount of}} time that a private equity firm spends raising capital varies {{depending}} on the level of interest among investors, which is defined by current market conditions and also the track record of previous funds raised by the firm in question. Firms can spend as little as one or two months raising capital when they are able to reach the target that they set for their funds relatively easily, often through gaining commitments from existing investors in their previous funds, or where strong past performance leads to strong levels of investor interest. Other managers may find fundraising taking considerably longer, with managers of less popular fund types (such as US and European venture fund managers in the current climate) finding the fundraising process more <b>tough.</b> <b>It</b> is not unheard of for funds to spend as long as two years on the road seeking capital, although the majority of fund managers will complete fundraising within nine months to fifteen months.|$|E

[...] He ultimately gave the release an eight out of ten, however, stating [...] "while this set is certainly well rated" [...] in its content, he could not [...] "find a reason to recommend it". Noel Murray of The A.V. Club expressed confusion over the selection of material, suggesting to the network to release a [...] "straight-up Adult Swim best-of set with rarities". DVD Verdict's Mac McEntire felt the set was not [...] "good enough to warrant you re-buying them all", should buyers already own all six season volume releases. He gave the release an 85 out of 100, remarking the pilots as showing [...] "just how <b>tough</b> <b>it</b> must be to create a pilot, one that not only introduces characters and settings, but also promises a potential for weeks and perhaps years of additional stories." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though enamel is {{described}} as <b>tough,</b> <b>it</b> has a similar brittleness to glass, [...] making it, unlike other natural crack-resistant laminate structures such as shell and nacre, potentially vulnerable to fracture. In spite of this it can withstand bite forces as high as 1,000 N many times a day during chewing. This resistance {{is due in part}} to the microstructure of enamel which contains processes, enamel tufts, that stabilize the growth of such fractures at the dentinoenamel junction. The configuration of the tooth also acts to reduce the tensile stresses that cause fractures during biting.|$|E

[...] He concluded [...] "Haven: Call of the King is quite an ambitious title. At certain points it's great, but at others it can be either frustrating or very boring.
