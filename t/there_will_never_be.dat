25|$|Progressive {{revelation is}} a core {{teaching}} in the Bahá'í Faith that suggests that religious truth is revealed by God progressively and cyclically over time {{through a series of}} divine Messengers, and that the teachings are tailored to suit the needs of the time and place of their appearance. Thus, the Bahá'í teachings recognize the divine origin of several world religions as different stages in the history of one religion, while believing that the revelation of Bahá'u'lláh is the most recent (though not the last—that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> a last), and therefore the most relevant to modern society.|$|E

25|$|Philosopher Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), who {{regularly}} cited De la Court's works, described in his unfinished Tractatus Politicus (1677) how the ideal state, a democratic republic, should function. According to Spinoza, kings {{have a natural}} tendency to pursue their own personal interests, and entrust large portions of power to confidants (who lack any official mandate, but often de facto run the country if the king is a weakling). These confidants are often noblemen, making it an aristocracy instead of a monarchy in practice. The best monarchy is a quasi-monarchy, a crowned republic in which princes have as little power as possible. Spinoza proposes a council of state, elected by citizens, to take the most important decisions, and replace the murderous and pillaging royal mercenary armies by an unpaid draft army of citizens that defends its own country for self-preservation. If this council of state is large and representative enough, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> a majority in favour of war, {{because of all the}} suffering, destruction and high taxes it will cause.|$|E

I should have thought that there must be a pretty large number there." [...] High replies that it is true there are a pretty large number of men there, adding many more have yet to arrive, yet that [...] "there will seem too few when the wolf comes." [...] However, High adds that food is not a problem because <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> too many people in Valhalla that the meat of Sæhrímnir (which he calls a boar) cannot sufficiently feed. High says that Sæhrímnir is cooked every day by the cook Andhrímnir in the pot Eldhrimnir, and is again whole every evening. High then quotes the stanza of Grímnismál mentioning the cook, meal, and container in reference.|$|E
500|$|Sinatra's {{split with}} Gardner {{in the fall}} of 1953 had a {{profound}} impact on the types of songs he sang and his voice. He began to console himself in songs with a [...] "brooding melancholy", such as [...] "I'm a Fool to Want You", [...] "Don't Worry 'Bout Me", [...] "My One and Only Love" [...] and <b>There</b> <b>Will</b> <b>Never</b> <b>Be</b> Another You", which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner. Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was [...] "not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt". Author Granata considered Sinatra to have been a [...] "master of the art of recording", noting that his work in the studio [...] "set him apart from other gifted vocalists". During his career he made over 1000 recordings. Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for it by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound. During his Columbia years Sinatra would use an RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as [...] "the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s", though when performing on talk shows later he would use a bullet-shaped RCA 77. At Capitol he used a Neumann U47, an [...] "ultra-sensitive" [...] microphone which better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.|$|E
500|$|Before Chamberlain, {{the most}} {{dominant}} big man in the NBA was [...] George Mikan. In November 1950, the Fort Wayne Pistons held the ball for {{minutes at a time}} without shooting to limit the impact of the Minneapolis Lakers' Mikan. The Pistons attempted 13 shots in the game, and won 19–18. NBA President Maurice Podoloff said, [...] "In our game, with the number of stars we have, we of necessity run up big scores." [...] In the , teams averaged just above 80 points per game. The NBA introduced the 24-second shot clock in 1954, and league scoring and attendance increased. By the , teams were averaging 119points each game. Chamberlain that season was one of 37black players in the league, the NBA having started integration of blacks in 1950. With their emergence, the NBA game was stylistically being played faster and above the rim. Many of the league's great players were black, and blacks believed they were limited by a league quota of four black players per team. Critics suggested that basketball was becoming uninteresting with taller players dominating. Warriors teammate Joe Ruklick thought that [...] "the attitude [...] was, in my opinion, ' is a freak who will come and go. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> a black guy doing this again.'" [...] Chamberlain, nicknamed Dipper, was revolutionizing the sport with his slam dunks, nicknamed the Dipper Dunk. Traditionalists considered dunking poor sportsmanship, and their occurrence was rare. As the league's second tallest player, Chamberlain began dunking more regularly. He was still more of a finesse player, preferring fadeaway shots and finger rolls. He rarely dunked forcefully. Teammate Paul Arizin believed Chamberlain {{did not want to be}} perceived as great merely from being tall.|$|E

2500|$|The castle {{is today}} entered from the south, via a modern portal {{complete}} with a portcullis.

Above this is carved the coat of arms of John Macrae-Gilstrap. The portal gives access to the courtyard, the level of which has been lowered exposing the bedrock around the tower house. The present buildings at the south-east of the castle reflect the form of the earlier structures, including the circular stair tower, but are larger in extent. To the south-west only the southern portion of the L-shaped block was reconstructed, as a plain three-storey house, while in place of the northern wing is an open platform giving views over the loch. [...] A small tower occupies the north-west angle. The keep itself follows the original dimensions, though the formerly subdivided ground floor is now a single room: the tunnel-vaulted Billeting Hall. Above on the first floor is the Banqueting Hall with an oak ceiling, and decorated with coats of arms and 15th-century style fireplace. The main ceiling beams in the Banqueting Hall are of Douglas Fir and were shipped from British Columbia, Canada as a gift from the Macraes of Canada.
