5|$|Philitas was {{the first}} major Greek writer who was both a scholar and a poet. His {{reputation}} continued for centuries, based on both his pioneering study of words and his verse in elegiac meter. His vocabulary Disorderly Words described <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> of rare literary words, including those used by Homer. His poetry, notably his elegiac poem Demeter, was highly respected by later ancient poets. However, almost all his work has since been lost.|$|E
5|$|The Epistles are {{admired for}} the way that their poetry and music fit so well together.

This {{may also have been}} intended to provide historical depth to his work; he sometimes devoted considerable energy to adapting melodies to fit an Epistle's needs.|$|E

40|$|Translation {{is a kind}} of process. It is not {{regarded}} as the product. The process of translation is decoding the source language text to find <b>the</b> <b>meaning.</b> After that, encoding <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> in <b>the</b> target language text. The process of decoding and encoding <b>meaning</b> in <b>the</b> translation process is not a simple activity. there are many considerations that have to be taken into account. Meaning equivalence has to be maintained well. Because of that, decoding and encoding <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> must be done properly. In finding <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of <b>the</b> source language text, {{it is not enough to}} pay attention merely on <b>the</b> referential <b>meaning.</b> <b>the</b> connotative <b>meaning</b> plays important role in gaining <b>the</b> right <b>meaning.</b> After getting <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of <b>the</b> source language text, maintaining meaning equivalence in target language can be difficult. There are problems that might rise the difficulty in finding <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> equivalence. <b>The</b> problems are the difference of language system, the difference of culture, <b>the</b> various <b>meanings</b> embedded by a word, and the lack of generic-spesific word relationship...|$|R

5|$|Historiographical {{studies of}} the May Revolution do not face many doubts or unknown details. Most of the {{information}} was properly recorded {{at the time and}} was made available to the public by the Primera Junta as patriotic propaganda. Because of this, historical views on the topic differ in their interpretations of <b>the</b> <b>meanings,</b> causes and consequences of the events, rather than in the accuracy of their depiction of the events themselves. The modern version of events does not differ significantly from the contemporary one.|$|E
5|$|Social pragmatic theories, also in {{contrast}} to the constraints view, focus on the social context in which the infant is embedded. According to this approach, environmental input removes the ambiguity of the word learning situation. Cues such as the caregiver's gaze, body language, gesture, and smile help infants to understand <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> of words. Social pragmatic theories stress the role of the caregiver in talking about objects, actions, or events that the infant is already focused-in upon.|$|E

5|$|The {{meaning of}} a reconstructed root is {{conventionally}} that of a verb; the terms root and verbal root are almost synonymous in PIE grammar. This is because, apart from {{a limited number of}} so-called root nouns, PIE roots overwhelmingly participate in verbal inflection through well-established morphological and phonological mechanisms. Their meanings are not always directly reconstructible, due to semantic shifts that led to discrepancies in <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> of reflexes in the attested daughter languages. Many nouns and adjectives are derived from verbal roots via suffixes and ablaut.|$|E
5|$|British {{archaeologist}} and anthropologist Katherine Routledge {{undertook a}} 1914–1915 scientific expedition to Rapa Nui {{with her husband}} to catalog the art, customs, and writing of the island. She was able to interview two elderly informants, Kapiera and a leper named Tomenika, who allegedly had some knowledge of rongorongo. The sessions were not very fruitful, as the two often contradicted each other. From them Routledge concluded that rongorongo was an idiosyncratic mnemonic device that did not directly represent language, in other words, proto-writing, and that <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> of the glyphs were reformulated by each scribe, so that the kohau rongorongo could not be read by someone not trained in that specific text. The texts themselves she believed to be litanies for priest-scribes, kept apart in special houses and strictly tapu, that recorded the island's history and mythology. By the time of later ethnographic accounts, such as Métraux (1940), much of what Routledge recorded in her notes had been forgotten, and the oral history showed a strong external influence from popular published accounts.|$|E
5|$|This pyramid was {{the last}} pyramid ever built {{as part of a}} {{mortuary}} complex in Egypt. The pyramid would be abandoned by subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom, for both practical and religious reasons. The Giza plateau offered plenty of room for building pyramids; but {{this was not the case}} with the confined, cliff-bound geography of Thebes and any burials in the surrounding desert were vulnerable to flooding. The pyramid form was associated with the sun god Re, who had been overshadowed by Amun in importance. One of <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> of Amun's name was the hidden one, which meant that it was now theologically permissible to hide the Pharaoh's tomb by fully separating the mortuary template from the actual burial place. This provided the added advantage that the resting place of the pharaoh could be kept hidden from necropolis robbers. All subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom would be buried in rock-cut shaft tombs in the Valley of the Kings.|$|E
