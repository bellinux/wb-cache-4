Hawaiian women learned <b>to</b> <b>quilt</b> from the wives of missionaries from New England in the 1820s. Though they learned both pieced work and applique, by the 1870s they had adapted applique techniques to create a uniquely Hawaiian mode of expression. The classic Hawaiian quilt design is a large, bold, curvilinear appliqué pattern that covers much of the surface of the quilt, with the symmetrical design cut from only one piece of fabric." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Brown {{begged to}} be allowed <b>to</b> <b>quilt</b> it when the patches were all nicely put together, and Patty {{was glad to have}} her, for that part of the work was beyond her skill.

60|$|These doubts she {{expressed}} to Dorcas Networthy, {{who was a}} small, plump woman, with a solemn face, who had lived with the widow {{for many years and}} who had become her devoted disciple. Whatever the widow did, that also did Dorcas--not so well, for her heart told her she could never expect to do that, but with a yearning anxiety to do everything as well as she could. She rose at five minutes past six, and in a subsidiary way she helped to get the breakfast, to eat it, to wash up the dishes, to work in the garden, <b>to</b> <b>quilt,</b> to sew, to visit and receive, and no one could have tried harder than she did to keep awake when the widow read aloud in the evening.|$|E

60|$|And here it may, perhaps, {{divert the}} curious reader, {{to give some}} account of my domestics, and my manner of living in this country, during a {{residence}} of nine months, and thirteen days. Having a head mechanically turned, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had made for myself a table and chair convenient enough, out of the largest trees in the royal park. Two hundred sempstresses were employed to make me shirts, and linen for my bed and table, all of the strongest and coarsest kind they could get; which, however, they were forced <b>to</b> <b>quilt</b> together in several folds, for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn. Their linen is usually three inches wide, and three feet make a piece. The sempstresses took my measure as I lay on the ground, one standing at my neck, and another at my mid-leg, with a strong cord extended, that each held by the end, while a third measured {{the length of the}} cord with a rule of an inch long. Then they measured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a mathematical computation, that twice round the thumb is once round the wrist, and so on to the neck and the waist, and by the help of my old shirt, which I displayed on the ground before them for a pattern, they fitted me exactly. Three hundred tailors were employed in the same manner to make me clothes; but they had another contrivance for taking my measure. I kneeled down, and they raised a ladder from the ground to my neck; upon this ladder one of them mounted, and let fall a plumb-line from my collar to the floor, which just answered the length of my coat: but my waist and arms I measured myself. When my clothes were finished, which was done in my house (for the largest of theirs {{would not have been able}} to hold them), they looked like the patch-work made by the ladies in England, only that mine were all of a colour.|$|E
