Many global companies, including IBM, Dell, Lenovo, AT, SAP, and Accenture, have built outsourcing and service centres here or {{plan to do}} so soon. Reasons for <b>the</b> <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> multi-national corporations include proximity to Western Europe, skilled labour force and the high density of universities and research facilities.|$|E

5|$|The Panic of 1893 {{caused the}} price of silver to crash; the gold price, however, {{remained}} fixed, as the United States was on the gold standard. <b>The</b> <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> silver miners into the gold mines caused a lowering of wages. Mine owners demanded longer hours for less pay.|$|E
5|$|The {{revitalization}} of {{businesses in the}} former village was credited to <b>the</b> <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> artists. Prior to the 1980s, store owners in Rosendale Village had either retired or died, and their shops had become residential or simply abandoned. Newcomers purchased these properties, restored them, and returned them to commercial service.|$|E

5|$|As a seaside resort, {{the economy}} is mainly based around tourism; there are several hotels and guest houses near the seafront, to {{accommodate}} <b>the</b> <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> visitors during the summer. The High Street {{has a variety of}} shops and services, and there are a small number of factories. The elderly population has led to many health and social care jobs at local care homes. At the 2001 UK census, 6.9% of the population resided in a medical or care establishment, compared with the national average of only 0.8%.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s, the {{population}} of Berlin was growing rapidly with <b>the</b> <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> around 50,000 people a year, creating a large administrative burden. When construction began on the Rotes Rathaus, the city had around half a million inhabitants, but this grew to 800,000 {{by the time of}} its completion in 1869. By the 1880s, the city had offices in ten additional buildings near the Rotes Rathaus and since it could not be extended, it was clear that a second administration building was required.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Hong Kong {{became the}} first of the Four Asian Tiger economies under rapid {{industrialisation}} driven by textile exports, manufacturing industries and re-exports of goods to China. As the population grew, with labour costs remaining low, living standards began to rise steadily. The construction of the Shek Kip Mei Estate in 1953 {{marked the beginning of the}} public housing estate programme to provide shelter for the less privileged and to cope with <b>the</b> <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> immigrants.|$|E

50|$|Lodgings {{available}} {{to the general public}} at festivals ranged from crude huts or tents to elaborate inns reserved for the Greek and Roman elite. Traders and those with connections in other cities often stayed in private homes. <b>The</b> <b>influxes</b> <b>of</b> tourists, particularly in Athens, created temporary economies, with vendors, prostitutes, and guides providing goods and services to the visitors.|$|R
5|$|In {{the month}} {{following}} {{the opening of}} the three new stations 6,000 additional commuters used the northwest service. The Cumberland station became particularly attractive to suburban commuters from Des Plaines and Park Ridge; a study commissioned shortly after the station's opening found that only 12.4% of commuters parking in the Cumberland and Rosemont stations were Chicagoans. <b>The</b> <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> suburban commuters to the new Blue Line stops led to a fall in ridership on the Chicago & Northwestern's Northwest Line, which traditionally served the northwest suburbs near the new stops.|$|E
5|$|India's {{geography}} and geology are climatically pivotal: the Thar Desert {{in the northwest}} and the Himalayas in the north work in tandem to effect a culturally and economically important monsoonal regime. As Earth's highest and most massive mountain range, the Himalayas bar <b>the</b> <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> frigid katabatic winds from the icy Tibetan Plateau and northerly Central Asia. Most of North India is thus kept warm or is only mildly chilly or cold during winter; the same thermal dam keeps most regions in India hot in summer.|$|E

5|$|Potassium ions are {{necessary}} for the function of all living cells. The transfer of potassium ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous abnormalities, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium. The body responds to <b>the</b> <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> dietary potassium, which raises serum potassium levels, with a shift of potassium from outside to inside cells {{and an increase in}} potassium excretion by the kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Since {{opening its}} first store in 1998, the NBA has seen {{increasing}} business opportunities in foreign markets mainly due to <b>the</b> <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> new international players. The biggest {{growth has been}} in China, where players Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian, combined with the interest generated by the 2008 Summer Olympics, created enough demand to open two new stores. The NBA has also expanded into games like Second Life where it created a virtual NBA Store in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Soviet-oriented parties, {{backed by}} the Soviet Red Army and {{in control of the}} {{security}} forces, held most of the power, concentrated especially in the Polish Workers' Party under Władysław Gomułka and Bolesław Bierut. Bierut represented <b>the</b> <b>influx</b> <b>of</b> appointees to the Polish party coming (during and after the war) from the Soviet Union and imposed by the Soviets, a process accelerated {{at the time of the}} PPR Congress of December 1945. The party's membership dramatically increased from perhaps a few thousand in early 1945 to over one million in 1948.|$|E

In 1979, the University of Alaska built the Patty Center, the first full indoor ice arena in Interior Alaska. The same year, the school started a NCAA Division I hockey team.|$|E
