5|$|American forces boarded Diana {{and rapidly}} removed {{everything}} of value, including guns, rigging, sails, clothing, and money. They laid hay under the stern {{to serve as}} kindling, and the vessel was set on fire at about 3 am <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> from falling back into British hands. The guns recovered were probably used in the American positions during the Battle of Bunker Hill.|$|E
5|$|Contracts {{were signed}} at Spring's tavern {{and it was}} {{arranged}} for the fight to take place at Hanslope, Buckinghamshire. But as a vast crowd of spectators began pouring into Hanslope the venue was switched {{at the last minute}} to Salcey Green, just inside Northamptonshire, thus rendering the Buckinghamshire constables powerless <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|In August 1513, James IV of Scotland invaded England {{with a large}} army; {{equipped}} with modern artillery, he took the border castles of Norham and Wark, and then moved south against Etal Castle. Etal surrendered quickly {{in the hope of}} avoiding being pillaged by James' army, but nonetheless it was at least partially slighted - deliberately damaged <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> being used as a defence.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the capture of all the wild individuals of the California condor, in 1988 the US Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in California. Only females were released <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> becoming an invasive species. The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America before the reintroduction of the California condors took place.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the war, Indiana was run by a Democratic and southern sympathetic majority in the state legislature. It was by the actions of Governor Oliver Morton, who illegally borrowed millions of dollars to finance the army, that Indiana could contribute so greatly to the war effort. Morton suppressed the state legislature {{with the help of the}} Republican minority <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> from assembling during 1861 and 1862.

5|$|At this point, the Muslims divided their forces: {{the bulk}} of the army, under Abbas, {{remained}} at Kamacha to continue the siege, while the remainder (an obviously exaggerated force of 50,000 according to the Zuqnin chronicler) was sent to raid further into Byzantine territory and pillage. The siege continued through the autumn, and the Arabs, who customarily did not take along many provisions, began suffering from lack of supplies. To solve their supply problems, they established a market for merchants from Mesopotamia and elsewhere. In the end, with winter approaching, Abbas was forced to raise the siege and retreat south, burning the large market-place <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> from falling into Byzantine hands.|$|E
5|$|Cadw {{carried out}} a major {{restoration}} project on the house over the next 42 months, combining large scale conservation with detailed surveying and archaeological analysis. The 19th-century Victoria Galley was demolished in 1995, and the bare, external stonework was re-rendered and lime washed. Large parts of the property were restored as they might have appeared in 1665, assisted by the record of Robert Wynn the younger's will, {{with the exception of}} the attic, which was restored to its probable 19th-century appearance. The intention of this was to emphasize the colour and comfort of the original building, <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> appearing inauthentically bleak and austere. Other sections of the house were redeveloped to hold exhibition displays and other visitor facilities.|$|E
5|$|Civil {{war broke}} out across England in 1642 between the {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament. Fortifications and artillery {{played an important role}} in the conflict, and most of the Device Forts saw service. The south and east of England were soon largely controlled by Parliament. The blockhouses at Gravesend and Tilbury were garrisoned by Parliament and used to control access to London. The castles along the Sussex and Kentish coastline were seized by Parliament in the opening phase of the war, Camber Castle then being decommissioned <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> being used by the enemy, the remainder continuing to be garrisoned. The royal fleet, which had been positioned in the Downs anchorage, sided with Parliament.|$|E

5|$|During the Battle of Britain, Hitler {{gave the}} German armed forces (Wehrmacht) a {{directive}} (Directive No. 16) that ordered provisional preparations for invasion of Britain.

The Luftwaffe was to destroy the RAF in order <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> from attacking the invasion fleet or providing protection for the Royal Navy's Home Fleet which might attempt to prevent a landing by sea. On 1 August Hitler gave the Luftwaffes commander-in-chief, Reichsmarschall (Empire Marshal) Hermann Göring and the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force) a (Directive No. 17) to launch the air assault.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War of the 1640s, Henry, {{a younger}} {{son in the}} Hastings family, became a Royalist {{commander}} in the Midlands. He based {{himself out of the}} castle until he was forced to surrender it after a long siege. A fresh rebellion occurred in 1648, leading Parliament to slight the castle in order <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>it</b> being used militarily: the two towers were badly damaged with gunpowder and undermining. Parts of the remaining castle were turned into a new house and continued to be used by members of the Hastings family for many years, although they moved their main residence to Donington Hall.|$|E
25|$|Limits {{vary with}} {{temperature}} and pressure, but are normally {{expressed in terms}} of volume percentage at 25°C and atmospheric pressure.
