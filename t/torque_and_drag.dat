Therefore, understanding the friction in the wellbore and how it affects hook load and torque is essential for well path design in planning phase as well as for real time monitoring analysis and post analysis. In planning phase the offset well <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> profiles will be used to better well planning.

40|$|Increasing {{temperature}} and pressure with depth, affects {{the properties of}} drilling fluid. The effect of {{temperature and}} pressure on the density and viscosity of drilling fluid is of great importance. This is because, among several reasons, it affects the calculation of downhole pressure and the buoyancy factor for the well. Correct pressure estimation, could pose a great concern regarding well integrity. The buoyancy factor would affect the effective weight of the drillstring, which again would be a property of calculation of <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> force in a well. In the work of evaluating the downhole temperature and pressure, modelling is important. In this thesis, models to do so, is investigated. Simulation of downhole conditions have been carried out. Sensitivity analysis, regarding the most critical parameters of the temperature, is performed. The effect of different sized pipes and equipment’s on the temperature and pressure will be investigated. If the result of changed size of a pipe is higher or lower temperature and/or pressure, this would again affect the density and viscosity of drilling fluid. <b>Torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> force is, as mentioned, connected to the calculation of the buoyancy factor. <b>Torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> control is {{an important aspect of}} well design.

The wellbore friction being a main limiting factor in extended reach well needs to be studied with the new developed models. This master thesis presents an application of the new 3 -dimentional analytical model developed by Bernt S. Aadn&# 248;y in the synthetic test and four real wells. Quite diverse wellbore trajectory and depth has been chosen for a better evaluation and comparison of the model with the measured data. In order to investigate the potential and limitation of the model, <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> analysis during the different operations such as tripping in, tripping out, rotating off bottom, combined up/down were investigated. An application of the analytical model for wellbore friction analysis in the actual wells is very time consuming and requires a lot data/input manipulation. As a part of the thesis assignment, it was required to create simplified means for application and testing the analytical model. With visual basic application in Excel a simple <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> simulator was created purely based on the analytical model simple solution. Along with the analytical model the master thesis includes Wellplan software for <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> analysis in all the included test and actual wells. Along with this, the project has a brief literature study of 3 D analytical model and <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> concept in general. The analytical model gives a reasonable <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> results. Based on comparison between the model and actual measurement, it has been observed that the analytical model simple solution in some cases may not precisely describe wellbore friction analysis. The discrepancy between Wellplan and the analytical model prediction occurs during the tripping in operations. Being a strong function of tension/compression in the drill string the analytical model for more accurate <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> prediction requires an application of the complete solution. The main challenge for this model is the complexity of its full application. There is an uncertainty regarding the model application in conjunction with drillstring effective tension.

Three aspects of coulomb clusters are studied using a modified box tree algorithm for particle dynamics: (1) The energy per particle for different sized clusters, (2) cluster rotation via external <b>torque,</b> <b>and</b> (3) single particle injection into an 18 particle cluster. The energy per particle for different particle numbers is demonstrated to be consistent with previous work modeling classically charged particles in parabolic potentials.

The magic clusters — those clusters whose shells do not differentially rotate — are shown to be stable under laser excitation, reaching an equilibrium between laser <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> gas <b>drag.</b> Differential rotation between cluster shells is also exhibited, and a future model deriving the inter-shell torque transfer under external torques will be developed.

This addition also has its impact on the rheological properties of drilling fluid which can affect its other function. By keeping this agenda in mind, different nanoparticles were added to drilling fluids at different concentrations and the impact on friction factor and viscosity was studied through tribometer and rheometer respectively. Graphene, carbon nanotubes, silica, alumina, cobalt and nickel nanoparticles were selected as potential particles and their effects were studied in three different base fluids.

Particularly in unconventional reservoirs such as gas shales or tight formations, horizontal wellbores provide a larger exposure to the formation, which enhances the production from such tight formations. The increase in <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> forces downhole in deviated borehole trajectories is one of the technical challenges that needs to be carefully studied during the design phase. There have been a number of different approaches to the way that <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> has been modelled in the industry. These include the soft string and stiff string approach and accounting for the effects of viscous fluid flow. The soft string model treats the drill string as a cable and assumes that it lies against the low side of the wellbore, meaning that the stiffness of the drill string is not accounted for. On the other hand, stiff string models take into account the stiffness and bending moment in the drill string and the radial clearance in the wellbore. Fluid flow during drilling results in the loss of the normal component of fluid pressure on the drill string as the flowing condition becomes dynamic. There is also an additional tangential component caused by viscous drag on the drill string due to the fluid flow. In this paper we will present the findings of a study aimed at determining the most appropriate type of <b>torque</b> <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> modelling approach that should be applied for Norwest Energy’s Redhill South- 1 well and future wells of similar nature. Redhill South- 1 was directionally drilled to test the gas potential of the Permian sands in a fault dependent structural closure. Both soft and stiff string approaches will be studied. The necessity to account for viscous drag effects will also be analysed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{propose a}} four-quadrant {{propeller}} model suitable for energy-efficient motion planning of autonomous marine vehicles. The {{model can be}} used to capture the main features of experimental thrust <b>and</b> <b>torque</b> curves by using a small number of parameters. We explore the connection between the propeller thrust, <b>torque,</b> <b>and</b> efficiency curves and the lift <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> curves of the propeller blades. The model originates from a well-known four-quadrant model, based on a sinusoidal approximation of the propeller curves, nontrivially modified in this paper to account for the typical drop off in the efficiency curve in correspondence to thrust inversion. Connections with the standard first-quadrant open-water model are drawn...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an analysis for predicting the <b>torque,</b> thrust, <b>and</b> bending moments {{at the root}} of rotor blades in a horizontal axis marine current turbine using the blade element-momentum theory combined with linear wave theory. The measured current velocities taken near the core of the Florida Current offshore Fort- Lauderdale, Florida are used in the evaluation of the loads on the rotor blades. The periodic loading on the blade due to the steady spatial variation of current speeds over the rotor swept area is determined by a limited number of parameters, including tip-speed ratio, Reynolds number, lift <b>and</b> <b>drag</b> coefficients, thrust <b>and</b> <b>torque</b> coefficients, <b>and</b> power coefficient. In the simulation modeling, numerical calculations are carried out for every time step on the assumption of quasi...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a brief overview}} on the results obtained during the scale model landing gear test in the Acoustic Wind Tunnel Braunschweig 1. Noise tests were conducted on different 4 -wheel landing gear configurations with (i) deceleration plates and (ii) splitter plates. The results presented in this report indicate that deceleration plates when attached between the rear wheels downstream of the axle tend to reduce the farfield radiated landing gear noise by up to 4 dB. In {{the course of this}} test best results were obtained by means of an inner wheel deceleration plate in combination with a short lower leg deceleration plate. The installation of an upper leg deceleration plate was not effective in terms of noise reduction. For splitter plates when applied to several gear components different results were obtained. While the wheel splitter plates tend to increase noise levels nearly no effect was measured for splitter plates located at the main strut and the side stay. A slight noise reduction of about 1 dB was documented for both the <b>torque</b> link <b>and</b> the <b>drag</b> stay splitter plate configuration. The noise test on a 2 -wheel landing gear again proved the beneficial effect of an inner wheel deceleration plate on farfield radiated noise. ...|$|R
