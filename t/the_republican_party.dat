5|$|As President of the United States, Rutherford B. Hayes {{had caused}} heated {{tensions}} within <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party.</b> Hayes had {{moved away from}} party patronage by offering government jobs to Southern Democrats instead of Northern Republicans. His actions drew heavy criticism from those inside his party, such as Roscoe Conkling of New York and James G. Blaine of Maine. Hayes had known since the dispute over the 1876 election that he was unlikely to win in 1880, and had announced at his 1877 inauguration {{that he would not}} run for a second term. Without an incumbent president in the race, the rival factions within <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> the Stalwarts and the Half-Breeds, eagerly anticipated the 1880 presidential election.|$|E

On March 27, 2008, Keyes's campaign website began displaying the Constitution Party's logo, along with a parody of the trademarked GOP logo {{in the form of a}} dead elephant.

5|$|Of the 14 men in {{contention}} for the Republican nomination, the three strongest candidates {{leading up to}} the convention were Ulysses S. Grant, James G. Blaine, and John Sherman.

He was backed by the Stalwart faction of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party,</b> which supported political machines and patronage.

5|$|A towering {{figure in}} <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>party</b> of his day, Blaine fell into obscurity fairly {{soon after his}} death. A 1905 {{biography}} by his wife’s cousin, Edward Stanwood, was written when the question was still in doubt, {{but by the time}} David Saville Muzzey published his biography of Blaine in 1934, the subtitle “A Political Idol of Other Days” already spoke to its subject’s fading place in the popular mind, perhaps because of the nine men <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>Party</b> nominated for the Presidency from 1860 to 1912, Blaine {{is the only one who}} never became President. Although several authors studied Blaine’s foreign policy career, including Edward P. Crapol’s 2000 work, Muzzey’s was the last full-scale biography of the man until Neil Rolde’s 2006 book. Historian R. Hal Williams was working on a new biography of Blaine, tentatively titled James G. Blaine: A Life in Politics, until his death in 2016.|$|E
