40|$|To {{test whether}} novel and {{previously}} hypothesized biogeogaphic barriers in the Australian <b>Tropics</b> represent significant disjunction points or hard barriers, or both, to {{the distribution of}} plants. Australian tropics: Australian Monsoon <b>Tropics</b> and Australian Wet <b>Tropics.</b> The {{presence or absence of}} 6, 861 plant species was scored across 13 putative biogeographic barriers in the Australian <b>Tropics,</b> including two that have not previously been recognised. Randomizations of these data were used to test whether more species showed disjunctions (gaps in distribution) or likely barriers (range limits) at these points than expected by chance. Two novel disjunctions in the Australian <b>Tropics</b> flora are identified in addition to eleven putative barriers previously recognized for animals. Of these, eleven disjunction points (all within the Australian Monsoon <b>Tropics)</b> were found to correspond to range-ending barriers to a significant number of species, while neither of the two disjunctions found within the Australian Wet <b>Tropics</b> limited a significant number of species' ranges. Biogeographic barriers present significant distributional limits to native plant species in the Australian Monsoon <b>Tropics</b> but not in the Australian Wet <b>Tropics...</b>|$|R

50|$|Biotic {{hypotheses}} claim ecological species interactions such as competition, predation, mutualism, and parasitism {{are stronger}} in the <b>tropics</b> and these interactions promote species coexistence and specialization of species, leading to greater speciation in the <b>tropics.</b> These hypotheses are problematic because they cannot be the proximate {{cause of the}} latitudinal diversity gradient as they fail to explain why species interactions might be stronger in the <b>tropics.</b> An example of one such hypothesis is the greater intensity of predation and more specialized predators in the <b>tropics</b> {{has contributed to the}} increase of diversity in the <b>tropics</b> (Pianka 1966). This intense predation could reduce the importance of competition (see competitive exclusion) and permit greater niche overlap and promote higher richness of prey.

50|$|Since the <b>tropics</b> {{represent}} 36 {{percent of}} the earth's surface and 20 percent of its land surface, the potential of tropical horticulture is huge. In contrast to temperate regions, environmental conditions in the <b>tropics</b> are defined less by seasonal temperature fluctuations and more by seasonality of precipitation. Thus the climate in {{the greater part of}} the <b>tropics</b> is characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons, although such variation is reduced in locations closer to the equator (±5° latitude). Temperature conditions in the <b>tropics</b> are affected by elevation, in which contrasting warmer and colder climate areas in the <b>tropics</b> can be differentiated, and highland areas in the <b>tropics</b> can consequently be more favourable for production of temperate plant species than are lowland areas.|$|R

5|$|Middle {{latitude}} glaciers {{are located}} either between the <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer and the Arctic Circle, or between the <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle. Both areas support glacier ice from mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and even smaller icecaps, {{which are usually}} located in higher mountainous regions. All are located in mountain ranges, notably the Himalayas; the Alps; the Pyrenees; Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges of North America; the Patagonian Andes in South America; and mountain ranges in New Zealand. Glaciers in these latitudes are more widespread and tend to be greater in mass the closer they are to the polar regions. They are the most widely studied over the past 150 years. As with examples located in the tropical zone, virtually all the glaciers in the mid-latitudes {{are in a state}} of negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E

5|$|The ACLU lost an {{important}} press censorship case when, in 1957, the Supreme Court upheld the obscenity conviction of publisher Samuel Roth for distributing adult magazines. As late as 1953, {{books such as}} <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer and From Here to Eternity were still banned.

5|$|The axial tilt of the Earth is {{approximately}} 23.439281° with {{the axis of}} its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies {{over the course of}} the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the <b>Tropic</b> of Cancer is facing the Sun, and winter taking place when the <b>Tropic</b> of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.|$|E

40|$|Acute kidney injury (AKI) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} problems faced by clinicians in the <b>tropics</b> owing to its fast-changing burden. AKI in the <b>tropics</b> is strikingly different from that in the developed world in terms of etiology and presentation. In addition, there is a stark contrast between well-developed and poor areas in the <b>tropics.</b> The true epidemiological picture of AKI in the <b>tropics</b> is not well understood due to the late presentation of patients to tertiary centers. Infections remain the major culprit in most cases of AKI, with high mortality rates in the <b>tropics.</b> Human immunodeficiency virus–related AKI, related to nephrotoxicity due to antiretroviral therapy, is on the rise. Acute tubular necrosis and thrombotic microangiopathy are the most common mechanisms of AKI. A notable problem in the <b>tropics</b> is the scarcity of resources in health centers to support patients who require critical care due to AKI.

40|$|Extract] Is {{life in the}} <b>Tropics</b> getting better? The {{landmark}} State of the <b>Tropics</b> 2014 Report addresses this nominally simple question.

Drawing on the knowledge, experience and diverse backgrounds of leading institutions across the <b>Tropics</b> the report assesses {{the state of the}} region and examines the implications of the immense changes the region is experiencing. The assessment demonstrates that nations in the <b>Tropics</b> have made extraordinary progress across a wide range of environmental, social and economic indicators in recent decades. Rapid population and economic growth mean its influence is set to rise dramatically in coming decades. The nature of this influence will depend on how the region addresses its many challenges, and whether it realises its potential and opportunities. The report provides a basis from which to work towards a prosperous, sustainable and equitable future for the <b>Tropics</b> and will be a valuable resource for policy makers, geopolitical analysts, researchers, students and other stakeholders interested in the <b>Tropics...</b>|$|R
