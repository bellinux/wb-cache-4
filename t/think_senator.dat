2500|$|Former Senator Phil Gramm was a {{co-chairman}} of the McCain campaign, and McCain's chief economic adviser. He {{stepped down from the}} campaign on July 18, 2008, about a week after he made remarks to The Washington Times about the nation's economic conditions. Gramm had said, [...] "You've heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession," [...] and [...] "We have sort of become a nation of whiners. You just hear this constant whining." [...] McCain had quickly repudiated Gramm's remarks, saying [...] "Phil Gramm doesn't speak for me, I speak for me. I strongly disagree." [...] When asked if Gramm was still in contention for the U.S. Treasury Secretary position as previously speculated, McCain had said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>Senator</b> Gramm would be in serious consideration for ambassador of Belarus, though I'm not sure the citizens of Minsk would welcome that." [...] Gramm said upon leaving that he had become a distraction to the campaign.|$|E

[...] "I can't imagine what you've done, my dear," [...] she said pleasantly, [...] "but I believe that you are capable of taking care of yourself, and I like you." ...|$|E
60|$|My friend went {{on summer}} {{vacation}} {{up into the}} fishing regions of our northern British neighbors, and carried this sermon with him, since he might possibly chance to need a sermon. He was asked to preach, one day. The little church was full. Among the people present were the late Dr. J. G. Holland, the late Mr. Seymour of the 'New York Times,' Mr. Page, the philanthropist and temperance advocate, and, I <b>think,</b> <b>Senator</b> Frye, of Maine. The marvelous letter did its wonted work; all the people were moved, all the people wept; the tears flowed in a steady stream down Dr. Holland's cheeks, and nearly {{the same can be}} said with regard to all who were there. Mr. Page was so full of enthusiasm over the letter that he said he would not rest until he made pilgrimage to that prison, and had speech with the man who had been able to inspire a fellow-unfortunate to write so priceless a tract.|$|E
5000|$|Mondale: [...] "I <b>think</b> uh - <b>Senator</b> Dole has richly {{earned his}} {{reputation}} as a hatchet man tonight, by implying, and stating, that World War II and the Korean War were Democratic wars. Does he really mean to suggest to the American people that there was a partisan difference over our involvement in the war to fight Nazi Germany? I don't think any reasonable American would accept that. Does he really mean to suggest that it was only partisanship that got us into the war in Korea?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it didn't {{amount to}} {{anything}} much," [...] {{he said with a}} chuckle as of satisfaction, pulling himself up with a start such as he might have given at the moment he made the unpleasant discovery that Mr. Towser was on his track. [...] "Of course it wasn't very great fun for me to run for my life at a time when I was scared nearly to death; but before the thing was ended I had a heap of fun. Say, what do you <b>think</b> of the <b>Senator,</b> anyway? ...|$|R
40|$|In {{looking out}} over all the many guests who fill the Senate Chamber today, I feel {{compelled}} to say, {{it looks like a}} wonderful homecoming in here today. It is delightful to <b>think</b> of <b>Senator</b> Bill Raggio who was such a great friend to all of us. Let us pray. Lord, we are ashamed that money and position speak to us more loudly than does the simple compassion of the human heart. Help us to care, as You care, for the little people who have no lobbyists and for the minority groups who sorely need justice. May it be the glory of our government that not only the strong are heard but also the weak; not only the powerful but the helpless; not only those with influence but also those who have nothing but a case and an appeal. May we put our hearts into our work and that our work may get into our hearts. AMEN...|$|R

5000|$|New Jersey Governor Chris Christie:Governor Chris Christie: “I {{just want}} to make clear that I have been working on this issue in my role on the {{executive}} committee of the National Governors Association because it is an important issue to all the nation’s governors. And I too - along with governors like Governor Daniels and others - urge {{the federal government and the}} Congress in particular to get behind Senator Lamar Alexander’s legislation to allow states to be able to make these choices for themselves. And I <b>think</b> <b>Senator</b> Alexander’s legislation would be a great step forward in that regard. It would give states options to decide how they want to deal with this and not have to any longer deal with the federal prohibition on dealing with it. So, it would allow us to do it in a much more uniform and broader way. So, I’m with Governor Daniels on this and other Republican governors - Governor Snyder of Michigan and others who feel strongly about it. And we’ve been working on it at the National Governors Association and I know we will continue to and hope to get some type of resolution to it by the end of this year.” ...|$|E
40|$|The five Supreme Court {{nominations}} between 2005 and 2010 brought renewed {{attention to}} the Senate’s role in the confirmation process. This Note explores {{the debate over the}} Senate’s proper role in that process. First, this Note summarizes and clarifies the two traditional views of the Senate’s role, classifying them as the 2 ̆ 2 assertive view 2 ̆ 2 and the 2 ̆ 2 deferential view, 2 ̆ 2 and offers a new framework for understanding these views. This Note then traces the traditional arguments made by proponents of these views. It first examines the historical arguments, both from original understanding and historical practice; it then turns to pragmatic arguments about which view better accomplishes the purposes of the Senate’s participation in the confirmation process. Neither the historical arguments nor the pragmatic arguments resolve the issue of which approach to the confirmation process is better. By recounting these arguments, however, this Note reveals the underlying—and unspoken—difference between adherents of the assertive view and adherents of the deferential view: their conceptions of the relationship between law and politics differ widely. Adherents of the assertive view can fall on either end of a spectrum in understanding the relationship between law and politics. For some adherents of the assertive view, law is completely distinct from politics, so they believe senators should carefully ensure that judicial nominees understand this distinction and should vote only for those nominees who do and will respect it. For other adherents of the assertive view, law and politics are {{two sides of the same}} coin, so they <b>think</b> <b>senators</b> should aggressively inquire into the views of judicial nominees and should vote only for those nominees whose views comport with their own. Either way, the assertive view results in the same role for the Senate in the confirmation process. Adherents of the deferential view, by contrast, fall somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, believing that law is underdetermined and is shaped, but not totally controlled, by politics. Adherents of this view make certain that nominees have reasonable legal views, but they are more willing to vote to confirm nominees whose views differ from their own. This Note brings this important difference to the forefront in hopes of promoting more meaningful discussions about the Senate’s role in the confirmation process...|$|R
50|$|When I <b>think</b> of the <b>Senator</b> of the Third District {{during the}} time he was occupying his seat - now veiled with crepes of {{mourning}} - in this august Senate, he seated beside me and was the most committed supporter of certain issues I sucitated in the parliamentary debates. I, like the whole Archipelago, cannot help but lament at his loss. His death assumes the total sorrowful meaning of a national loss. And I say national loss, because his dynamism, his vigor and his patriotism channeled to serve the country in these historical moments will be of great and undisputed value; will be positive contributions in the task of nation building whose completion we anxiously hope for.|$|R
40|$|Almighty God, we pause at the {{beginning}} of this Session to acknowledge you as the source of wisdom and understanding. We acknowledge that you have created us in Your image and given us gifts and talents with which we can use to serve each other. We thank You again for these who have chosen to live lives of service. I pray that they will feel the reward that comes by serving, especially in the affairs of government. We <b>think</b> today of <b>Senator</b> Denis and his family and ask for your grace to be extended to them. In the days ahead, many and important bills will be considered and voted upon here. I pray that You will give wisdom from above, and may each member have the courage to vote according to their own values. I pray that the laws enacted will benefit the people of this great State. In the name of Him who gives us wisdom and courage...|$|R
5000|$|In June 2009, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington D.C. based <b>think</b> tank, and <b>Senator</b> James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma) {{claimed that}} the EPA had {{suppressed}} a report authored by Alan Carlin, that {{cast doubt on the}} existence of global warming and the need to regulate CO2 emissions. Senator Inhofe {{wrote a letter to the}} EPA Administrator, Lisa Jackson, requesting that the agency reopen this matter and called for a congressional investigation of the suppression.The EPA Press Secretary Adora Andy, responded: [...] "Claims that this individual’s opinions were not considered or studied are entirely false[...] [...] [...] The individual in question is not a scientist and was not part of the working group dealing with this issue. Nevertheless the document he submitted was reviewed by his peers and agency scientists, and information from that report was submitted by his manager to those responsible for developing the proposed endangerment finding. In fact, some ideas from that document are included and addressed in the endangerment finding. Additionally, his manager has allowed his general views on the subject of climate change to be heard and considered inside and outside the EPA and presented at conferences and at an agency seminar. And this individual was granted a request to join a committee that organizes an ongoing climate seminar series, open to both agency and outside experts, where he has been able to invite speakers with a full range of views on climate science." ...|$|R
