5|$|Above {{the layer}} of {{metallic}} hydrogen lies a transparent interior atmosphere of hydrogen. At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above hydrogen's critical pressure of 1.2858 MPa and critical temperature of only 32.938K. In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas phases—hydrogen {{is said to be}} in a supercritical fluid state. It is convenient to treat hydrogen as gas in the upper layer extending downward from the cloud layer <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> about 1,000km, and as liquid in deeper layers. Physically, there is no clear boundary—the gas smoothly becomes hotter and denser as one descends.|$|E
5|$|As an extratropical cyclone, Charley brought heavy {{rainfall}} and strong winds to Ireland and the United Kingdom, causing at least 11deaths. In Ireland, the rainfall set records for 24-hour totals, including {{an accumulation of}} more than 7.8in (200mm) which set {{the record for the}} greatest daily rainfall total in the country. In the country, the rainfall caused widespread flooding, causing two rivers to exceed their banks. In the Dublin area, 451buildings were flooded, some up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 8ft (2.4m). In the United Kingdom, the storm flooded rivers and brought down trees and power lines.|$|E

5|$|Some {{of these}} lava flows blocked rivers and streams, {{impounding}} small lakes and ephemeral ponds in the process. About 100,000years ago, basalt from the largest cinder cone in the park, Crater Hill, flowed over the area.

5|$|Although {{some of its}} {{stones were}} plundered for use elsewhere, the Pont du Gard {{remained}} largely intact. Its survival was due to its use as a toll bridge across the valley. In the 13th century the French king granted the seigneurs of Uzès the right to levy tolls on those using the bridge. The right later passed to the Bishops of Uzès. In return, they were responsible for maintaining the bridge in good repair. However, it suffered serious damage during the 1620s when Henri, Duke of Rohan made use of the bridge to transport his artillery during the wars between the French royalists and the Huguenots, whom he led. To make space for his artillery to cross the bridge, the duke had {{one side of the}} second row of arches cut away <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> about one-third of their original thickness. This left a gap on the lowest deck wide enough to accommodate carts and cannons, but severely weakened the bridge in the process.|$|E
5|$|Any {{astatine}} {{present at}} {{the formation of the}} Earth has long since disappeared; the four naturally occurring isotopes (astatine-215, -217, -218 and -219) are instead continuously produced {{as a result of the}} decay of radioactive thorium and uranium ores, and trace quantities of neptunium-237. The landmass of North and South America combined, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 16 kilometers (10 miles), contains only about one trillion astatine-215 atoms at any given time (around 3.5 × 10−10 grams). Astatine-217 is produced via the radioactive decay of neptunium-237. Primordial remnants of the latter isotope—due to its relatively short half-life of 2.14 million years—are no longer present on Earth. However, trace amounts occur naturally as a product of transmutation reactions in uranium ores. Astatine-218 was the first astatine isotope discovered in nature. Astatine-219, with a half-life of 56 seconds, is the longest lived of the naturally occurring isotopes.|$|E

5|$|First passing {{just south}} of Ireland on August25, the storm dropped heavy {{rainfall}} and brought strong winds, significantly affecting the coastline where winds of 65mph (105km/h) were reported. Rainfall spread across the entire country, peaking at 11.0in (280mm) in Kippure. There, a station reported more than 7.8in (200mm) in 24hours, which set {{the record for the}} greatest daily rainfall total in the country. Several 24-hour rainfall records were set during the storm, and new six-hour and twelve-hour record totals at Casement Aerodrome were set with 1.63in (41.5mm) and 2.61in (66.2mm), respectively. The rainfall left some areas flooded, particularly in the Dublin area where 451buildings were inundated, some up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 8ft (2.4m). Preliminarily, it was described as the worst flooding in the history of Dublin. Two small rivers, the Dodder and the Dargle, overflowed their banks due to the rainfall. The River Dargle overflowed in Bray, flooding some areas up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 5ft (1.5m) and forcing about 1,000people to evacuate; several special-needs people were evacuated by boat. The flood, which originated about one mile north of the town, damaged over 500houses and brought down several trees. Despite local politicians promising for flood protection after the flood, the town remained vulnerable to such flooding at least 20years after the storm. The River Dodder, which also overflowed, nearly exceeded the reservoir dam in Bohernabreena in South Dublin. Additional spillways were later added in the event of another similar flood. In the Wicklow Mountains, the rainfall resulted in significant runoff, which caused erosion along the Cloghoge River. The passage of the storm left heavy crop damage, part of a larger period of poor agriculture in the country. Throughout the country, the storm caused at least thirteen deaths, four of which were drownings in flooded rivers; one death was caused by a heart attack while being evacuated from flooding. Two months after the storm struck, the government of Ireland allocated IR£6,449,000 (1986IEP, $8,650,000 1986USD) to repair roads and bridges damaged by the weather system.|$|E
5|$|Occurring {{close to}} shore from the surf zone <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> , the milk shark favors turbid water off sandy beaches and {{occasionally}} enters estuaries. In Shark Bay, Western Australia, juvenile milk sharks inhabit seagrass meadows composed of Amphibolis antarctica and Posidonia australis. Although some sources state this species avoids low salinities, {{it has been}} reported several times from fresh water in Cambodia, as far upstream as the Tonlé Sap. Milk sharks may be found anywhere in the water column from the surface to the bottom. Off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, its numbers fluctuate annually with a peak in summer, suggesting some form of seasonal movement.|$|E

5|$|Pilot whales {{generally}} {{take several}} breaths before diving {{for a few}} minutes. Feeding dives may last over ten minutes. They are capable of diving to depths of 600 meters, but most dives are <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 30–60 m. Shallow dives tend to take place during the day, while deeper ones take place at night. When making deep dives, pilot whales often make fast sprints to catch fast-moving prey such as squid. Compared to sperm whales and beaked whales, foraging short-finned pilot whales are more energetic at the same depth. When they {{reach the end of}} their dives, pilot whales will sprint, possibly to catch prey, and then make a few buzzes. This is unusual considering deep-diving, breath-holding animals would be expected to swim slowly to conserve oxygen. The animal's high metabolism possibly allows it to sprint at deep depths, which would also give it shorter diving periods than some other marine mammals. This may also be the case for long-finned pilot whales.|$|E
5|$|The dog conch {{lives on}} muddy sand bottoms among algae and {{seagrass}} beds on insular and continental shores. It usually prefers major islands and continental coasts {{rather than the}} shores of small islands, although {{this is not an}} absolute rule. L.canarium prefers areas of mixed seagrasses (with a predominance of Halophila), and also prefers sediment with high levels of organic matter. This conch avoids environments with a high density of Enhalus acoroides, a large seagrass native to coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific. The dog conch can be found in littoral and sublittoral zones, from shallow water <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 55m (180ft). It is normally found in large colonies, and is usually abundant wherever it occurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{euphotic}} zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as {{extending from the}} surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1–1% of surface sunlight irradiance, depending on season, latitude and degree of water turbidity. In the clearest ocean water, the {{euphotic zone}} may extend <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> about 150metres, or rarely, up to 200metres. Dissolved substances and solid particles absorb and scatter light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of these substances causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. In such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or less. The dysphotic zone, where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface irradiance, extends {{from the base of}} the euphotic zone to about 1000metres. Extending from the bottom of the photic zone down to the seabed is the aphotic zone, a region of perpetual darkness.|$|E

This was in concert with artillery strikes starting at 14:05 from nearly 2,000 pieces against the Bar-Lev line, and against armor concentration areas and artillery positions, using field guns, howitzers, mortars, tank guns, B-10 and B-11 recoilless rifles. The self-propelled 152 mm howitzers and 130 mm field guns were assigned counter-battery fire missions against Israeli artillery. The 53-minute-long fire preparation, {{one of the largest}} in history, was divided into four barrages. The first, fifteen minutes long, was aimed at enemy targets on the eastern bank up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> 1.5kilometers.
