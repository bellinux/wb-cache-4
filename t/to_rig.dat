They {{were expected}} to have learned already, as able seamen and volunteers, <b>to</b> <b>rig</b> sails, other duties included keeping watch, relaying messages between decks, supervising gun batteries, commanding small boats, and taking command of a sub-division of the ship's company under the supervision of one of the lieutenants. On smaller ships, midshipmen were instructed by a senior master's mate, often a passed midshipman, who taught them mathematics, navigation, and sailing lore. Larger ships would carry a schoolmaster, who was rated as a midshipman but usually was a civilian like the chaplain. Midshipmen {{were expected to}} keep detailed navigational logs, which were shown to the captain to assess their progress.|$|E

5|$|On 1 October 1944, Alejandro Cordova, {{the editor}} of El Imparcial, the main {{opposition}} newspaper, was assassinated. This led to the military coup plotters {{reaching out to the}} leaders of the protests, in an attempt to turn the coup into a popular uprising. Ponce Vaides announced elections, but the pro-democracy forces denounced them as a fraud, citing his attempts <b>to</b> <b>rig</b> them. Ponce Vaides sought to stabilize his regime by playing on inter-racial tension within the Guatemalan population. The most vocal support for the revolution had come from the Ladinos, or people of mixed racial or Spanish descent. Ponce Vaides sought to exploit their fear of the Indians by paying thousands of indigenous peasants to march in Guatemala City in his support, and promising them land if they supported the Liberal party that Ubico had begun as a front for the dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|Sharpe James, who {{defeated}} Gibson in 1986 {{and declined}} {{to run for}} a sixth term in 2006, was indicted on 33 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, and wire fraud by {{a federal grand jury}} sitting in Newark. The grand jury charged James with spending $58,000 on city-owned credit cards for personal gain and orchestrating a scheme to sell city-owned land at below-market prices to his companion, who immediately re-sold the land to developers and gained a profit of over $500,000. James pleaded not guilty on 25 counts at his initial court appearance on July 12, 2007. On April 17, 2008, James was found guilty {{for his role in the}} conspiring <b>to</b> <b>rig</b> land sales at nine city-owned properties for personal gain. The former mayor was sentenced to serve up to 27 months in prison, and was released on April 6, 2010, for good behavior.|$|E
5|$|The {{visit to}} the US was the high point in Diệm's {{relations}} with his primary sponsor. The Americans began to place increasing pressure on Diệm to carry out democratic reforms and liberalize the political system, particularly during ambassadorship of Elbridge Durbrow. Diệm resisted the calls to broaden {{the base of his}} government and continued <b>to</b> <b>rig</b> elections. Meanwhile in the US, his support among the AFV also declined, in part due to his ongoing authoritarianism, and also because of his persistent complaints to them about negative media depictions of his regime; many Vietnamese leaders of various persuasions did not understand that western governments did not control their own media. Pressure also increased on Diệm at home, as the communists intensified their insurgency against him. In November 1960, discontent in his own army prompted a failed coup attempt by paratroopers. Although Diệm eventually organized for loyalists to put down the coup, he was angered by Durbrow's calls for him to try to negotiate a settlement, regarding the lack of support for his zero tolerance policy as a betrayal.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fifth}} episode, {{president}} Teikun Ō is found dead, and Bansai attempts <b>to</b> <b>rig</b> Miwa's trial in her favor by manipulating Mikagami through {{the kidnapping of}} her adopted son, Shimon Aizawa. Edgeworth prevents this, and investigates the murder, learning that Teikun Ō has been dead for twelve years: the person previously {{thought to be the}} president was a body double, who had hired Hōinbō to kill the president to take his place, and was helped by Miwa and Bansai to cover up the crime. Sarushiro is revealed to be Kazami's long lost son; as a child, he was abducted by Hyōdō to prevent Kazami from winning the cooking contest. Hyōdō forced his own son, Naito, to dispose of Sarushiro, hence why Sarushiro had Naito killed. Hōinbō found Sarushiro and brought him to an orphanage; Sarushiro later saw Hōinbō kill Teikun Ō on behalf of the body double, Miwa and Bansai. They betrayed Hōinbō, but Sarushiro helped him escape; he later enacted his revenge on them, manipulating them into killing Naitō and Kagome, and killing the body double. In addition, {{he was the one who}} attacked and framed Kay to ensure that Edgeworth got involved and exposed Bansai. Sarushiro is imprisoned, and Edgeworth regains his position as a prosecutor.|$|E
5|$|Other {{scientists}} {{working for}} Davros, now {{aware of his}} plans, free the Doctor and give him enough time <b>to</b> <b>rig</b> the Dalek incubation room with explosives which would end {{the threat of the}} Daleks. As he is about to touch the two exposed wire ends to set them off, the Doctor questions if he has the right to make that decision and forgoes setting the explosions off. Just then, he learns that Davros has agreed to stop and allow the Kaled leaders to vote on the continuation of the project. As the leaders gather for this vote, the Doctor is able to recover the Time Ring and destroy the recordings he made, while learning that the Thals and Mutos have prepared the means to destroy the bunker. As the vote is called, Davros reveals this was all a decoy, giving the Daleks he sent to the Thal time to return to the bunker and exterminate the remaining Kaleds. Harry and Sarah escape the chaos, while the Doctor returns to set off the incubator room's explosives, but a Dalek inadvertently completes the circuit and sets it off itself. The Doctor escapes in time before the Thal and Mutos' bomb caves in the bunker, trapping Davros and the Daleks. Inside, Davros realises the Daleks have gained a will of their own, and attempts to stop the production line, but a Dalek incapacitates him.|$|E

TGS cast member Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) learns that the auditions are taking place and worries that her position on the show will be lessened with the arrival of a new actor. Although Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), the star of the show, reassures Jenna that the two have nothing to worry about, she remains uneasy. Later, Jenna discovers that Liz and Pete want Jayden to be cast, but she pleads with Liz to pull Jayden out of his audition. Jenna hates him for humiliating her after working together on a play, but Liz does not change her mind about Jayden.
