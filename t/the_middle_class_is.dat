25|$|<b>The</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> {{perhaps the}} most vaguely defined of the social classes. The term can be used either to {{describe}} a relative elite of professionals and managers – also called the upper middle class – {{or it can be}} used to describe those in-between the extremes of wealth, disregarding considerable differences in income, culture, educational attainment, influence, and occupation.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Brookings Institution in June 2006 {{revealed}} that Middle-income neighborhoods as {{a proportion of}} all metropolitan neighborhoods declined from 58 percent in 1970 to 41 percent in 2000. As housing costs increase, <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> squeezed and forced to live in less desirable areas making upward mobility more difficult. Safety, school systems, and even jobs are all linked to neighborhood types.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} social {{classes in the}} United States, there are no {{definite}} answers {{as to what is}} and what is not middle class. Sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert, James Henslin, William Thompson, and Joseph Hickey have brought forth class models in which <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> divided into two sections that combined constitute 47% to 49% of the population. The upper middle or professional class constitutes {{the upper end of the}} middle class which consists of highly educated, well-paid professionals with considerable work autonomy. The lower end of the middle class – called either lower middle class or just middle class – consists of semi-professionals, craftsmen, office staff, and sales employees who often have college degrees and are very loosely supervised.|$|E

25|$|The most {{prominent}} academic models split {{the middle class}} into two sections. Yet, it remains common for the term middle class to be applied for anyone in between either extreme of the socio-economic strata. <b>The</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> then often sub-divided into an upper-middle, middle-middle, and lower-middle class. In colloquial descriptions of the class system the middle-middle class may be described as consisting {{of those in the}} middle of the social strata. Politicians and television personalities such as Lou Dobbs can be seen using the term middle class in this manner, especially when discussing the middle-class squeeze. The wide discrepancy between the academic models and public opinions that lump highly educated professionals together in the same class with secretaries may lead to the conclusion that public opinion on the subject has become largely ambiguous.|$|E
25|$|Some modern {{theories}} of political economy consider a large middle class to be a beneficial, stabilizing influence on society, {{because it has}} neither the possibly explosive revolutionary tendencies of the lower class, nor the absolutist tendencies of an entrenched upper class. Most sociological definitions of middle class follow Max Weber. Here <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> defined as consisting of professionals or business owners who share a culture of domesticity and sub-urbanity and a level of relative security against social crisis, {{in the form of}} socially desired skill or wealth. Thus the theory on the middle class by Max Weber can be cited as one that supports the notion of the middle class being composed of a quasi-elite of professionals and managers, who are largely immune to economic downturns and trends such as out-sourcing which affect the statistical middle class.|$|E

2500|$|The {{influence}} {{of the middle class}} depends on which theory one utilizes. If <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> defined as a modern bourgeoisie, the [...] "middle class" [...] has great influence. If middle class is used in a manner that includes all persons who are at neither extreme of the social strata, it might still be influential, as such definition may include the [...] "professional middle class", which is then commonly referred to as the [...] "upper middle class". Despite the fact that the professional (upper) middle class is a privileged minority, it is the perhaps the most influential class in the United States.|$|E

To succeed and thrive in the global, high-tech economy, we need America to be a place with the highest-skilled, highest-educated workers; the most advanced transportation and communication networks; and the strongest commitment to research and technology in the world. This Budget makes investments that can help America win this race, create good jobs, and lead in the world economy." ...|$|E

Don't you see your position, gentlemen? <b>The</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> a wobbly little lamb between a lion and a tiger. If one doesn't get you, the other will.

They don't want the machines destroyed. And greater than the trusts, and more powerful, is labor. It will not let you destroy the machines. The ownership of the world, along with the machines, lies between the trusts and labor. That is the battle alignment. Neither side wants the destruction of the machines. But each side wants to possess the machines. In this battle the middle class has no place. <b>The</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> a pygmy between two giants.

60|$|The {{scene in}} the harbour {{is by no means}} lively, {{although}} the three or four dismantled merchant-craft, dreary as the settlement, have now disappeared. A little white-painted colonial steamer, a dwarf paddle-wheeler, the Prince of Wales, lies moping and solitary off foul Krutown Bay. At times a single gunboat puts in an appearance. There may be a French steamer with a blue anchor on a white flag bound for Sherbro, or the Isles de Los; and a queer Noah's Ark kind of craft, belonging to Mr. Broadhurst, a partner in Randall and Fisher's, runs to the river Scarcies and others. These are the grandees of the waters. <b>The</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> composed of Porto Loko [Footnote: Porto Loko--not Locco--derives its name from a locust-tree, whose fruit is an ingredient in 'palaver sauce;' and Winterbottom (I.4), who calls it Logo, derives the word from the land of that name.] boats, which affect the streams and estuaries. Originally canoes, they were improved to the felucca-type of the Portuguese, and the hulls reminded Cameron and myself of the Zanzibarian 'Mtepe.' A strong standing-awning of wood occupies the sternward third; the masts number two or three, with a short jib, and there are six oars on each side, worked by men on foot, who alternately push and pull--a thoroughly novel process in rowing. The Sá Leone boats which carry passengers on shore are carefully named, but apparently never washed: they want the sunshades of the Bathurst craft. The commonalty of the sea is the host of dug-outs, in which the sable fisherman, indolently thrown back, props his feet upon the gunwales and attaches a line to each big toe. These men land little more than enough for their own subsistence, and the market-supply is infinitesimal compared with what industry and proper appliances might produce.|$|E

Bernstein noted that the working <b>class</b> <b>was</b> not homogeneous but heterogeneous, with divisions and factions within it, including socialist and non-socialist trade unions. Marx himself later in his life acknowledged that <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> not disappearing, in his work Theories of Surplus Value.
