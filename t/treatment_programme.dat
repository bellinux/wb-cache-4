25|$|At {{the same}} time, Seacliff was {{groundbreaking}} {{in some parts}} of its <b>treatment</b> <b>programme,</b> with noted medical reformer Truby King appointed Medical Superintendent in 1889, a position he held for 30 years. Patients were 'prescribed' fresh air, exercise, good nutrition and productive work (for example, in on-site laundries, gardens, and a forge) as part of their therapeutic regime. King is credited as having turned what was essentially conceived as a prison into an efficient working farm. Another of King's innovations, was his implementation of small dormitories housed in buildings adjacent to the larger asylum. This style of accommodation has been considered the forerunner to the villa system later adopted by all mental health institutions in New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|Scheduled {{to appear}} in Eastern Magistrates' Court on 7 April, Acting Principal Magistrate Bina Chainrai recused herself due to her {{familiarity}} with Bokhary; the defence was granted a further delay, to permit preparation of a medical assessment. She pleaded guilty on 7 July, advancing mental illness in mitigation. On 2 August, she was sentenced to 12 months' probation and a fine of HK$8,000; her driving licence was suspended for 12 months. As a condition of her probation, she would also enter a <b>treatment</b> <b>programme</b> at the Betty Ford Center in the United States. Passing sentence, magistrate Anthony Yuen Wai-ming stated that her offences would normally result in prison time, but he decided to be lenient because of her mental disorder. Yuen's comment in his judgment that Bokhary has an [...] "unblemished background and {{was born into a}} good family with caring parents [...] an outstanding academic record" [...] caused an uproar locally. Her resulting probation was criticised in certain quarters, notably by the police, for its leniency. Between 6 and 7 August, Magistrate Yuen reviewed the case, but did not change his ruling.|$|E

40|$|This meta-synthesis explores individuals' {{experiences}} {{of engaging in}} psychotherapeutic interventions for sexual offending. The findings of ten qualitative studies were integrated and five over-arching concepts emerged: (1) incentives and inhibitions: to engage or not to engage?; (2) help or hindrance: the impact of others in therapy; (3) the abused and the abuser: perspectives for transformation; (4) struggling and striving: dealing with distress and difficulties and (5) what works: inside and outside. A line of argument derived from these concepts is proposed {{as a framework for}} understanding sex offenders' {{experiences of}} therapy and highlights aspects of <b>treatment</b> <b>programmes</b> that need further exploration or emphasis. Using qualitative accounts can improve the responsiveness of <b>treatment</b> <b>programmes,</b> but such research is currently limited.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{offenders}} with intellectual disabilities have {{substance use}} issues. Offending behaviour {{may be associated}} with substance use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prisoners with and without intellectual disabilities were compared in terms of their substance use prior to imprisonment, the influence of substance use on offending, and their participation in alcohol and drug <b>treatment</b> <b>programmes.</b> RESULTS: Substance use was similar in prisoners with and without intellectual disabilities in the year prior to their current prison terms. Prisoners with intellectual disabilities were much less likely to report that substance use was an antecedent to the offences leading to their imprisonment. The completion rate of alcohol and drug <b>treatment</b> <b>programmes</b> was much lower for those with intellectual disabilities. CONCLUSIONS: Substance use may be as common in prisoners with intellectual disabilities as those without this condition. Services may need to reflect on whether their <b>treatment</b> <b>programmes</b> are meeting the needs of all prisoners...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND More {{and more}} {{evidence-based}} treatments for severe personality disorders are becoming available. Nevertheless, {{there are problems}} with the implementation of these treatments and it is proving difficult to keep the <b>treatment</b> <b>programmes</b> running. However, teams which offer dialectical behavior therapy (dbt) seem to survive. AIM To find out which factors enable dbt teams to survive. METHOD Twenty-five Dutch dbt teams received a questionnaire about factors that could be influencing the continuation of the dbt <b>treatment</b> <b>programmes.</b> The questionnaire consisted of 9 open questions, 2 multiple-choice questions and 26 closed questions. RESULTS The results show that the continued existence of the <b>treatment</b> <b>programmes</b> is due largely to the commitment of both the team and its managers. They all feel embedded in the organisation as a whole, feel connected with one another and are supportive of the method. CONCLUSION A well-functioning consultation team seems to be of crucial importance for the continued existence of the dbt programme. We believe that independent external supervision is essential to keep the dbt teams alert and aware of current trends and developments. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Theoretical suppositions {{suggest a}} {{potential}} vulnerability in some individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASCs) to displaying offending behaviours. Additionally, it is recognised that {{the features of}} ASCs may result in possible barriers to treatment. A systematic review was undertaken to identify empirical evidence examining the effectiveness of <b>treatment</b> <b>programmes</b> for offenders with ASCs and to explore {{the potential impact of}} ASC symptoms on treatment outcomes. The studies identified consisted of a small number of case series and a collection of case reports with little or no direct comparisons to offenders without ASCs. A synthesis of the findings highlighted variability in treatment approach and impact. Effectiveness was primarily defined by reduction in further offending behaviours and was found to be variable across the data. The potential relationship between the symptoms of ASCs and treatment outcome was explored with all case reports identifying the need for adaptations to <b>treatment</b> <b>programmes,</b> necessitated by the symptoms of ASCs. This systematic review joins an existing body of literature emphasising need for more controlled research into the effectiveness of offending behaviour <b>treatment</b> <b>programmes</b> for individuals with ASCs, and for further investigation into the impact of the clinical features of ASCs on treatment outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss the {{implementation}} and evaluation of interventions for women firesetters in high secure mental healthcare at the UK’s National Women’s Service. Design/methodology/approach Two types of Arson <b>treatment</b> <b>programmes</b> for women, one delivered to individuals, the other within a group context, were developed, delivered and evaluated. The evaluation incorporated qualitative and quantitative data, including psychometric measures. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings The evaluation evidenced very high engagement with and attendance at <b>treatment</b> <b>programmes,</b> and several post-treatment gains. Participants’ ratings of programmes and qualitative feedback were similarly very positive. The study demonstrated that engaging women firesetters in their treatment is paramount and can be facilitated by consistent boundaries around therapy provision balanced with sensitivity, empathy and flexibility; providing interactive and varied teaching methods; ongoing service user involvement and recognising participants’ achievements; employing a mixed cognitive analytic therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy therapeutic approach; having input from fire service staff; and maintaining organisational support for firesetting interventions. Practical implications In all, 12 key recommendations are made for clinicians considering offering <b>treatment</b> <b>programmes</b> for women firesetters.
