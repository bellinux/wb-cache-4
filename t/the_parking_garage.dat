In between these scenes, the video shows a Step Up-type dance-off in <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>garage.</b> When Brown raps his verse, he is seen standing next to Rhymes, wearing horn-rimmed glasses, a red Brooklyn cap, and a white baseball jersey, which was the signature look of Mars Blackmon from the 1986 film, She's Gotta Have It. Rhymes then raps his verse after Brown's, standing beside him and later on the stairs in <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>garage.</b> Wayne's verse soon follows after, with scenes of him rapping {{in front of the}} DeLorean DMC-12 sports car, and also on top of an ambulance car. The video also features cameo appearance from Kevin McCall, Diplo, Birdman and Mack Maine. Birdman and Maine appear when Lil Wayne is performing his verse.|$|E

Black informs the FBI that the bomber is smart {{enough to be able}} to tap into their phonecalls, and volunteers to bait him into eavesdropping on his mobile phone. Black's deduction is correct, and as he attempts to stall Dees on the phone while the FBI trace the call, he realises from Dees' language that the bomber is seeking to become famous through his actions. Dees informs the FBI that he has planned another bombing for the next morning.|$|E

5|$|Filming moved {{once again}} in January 2011 to the Druid Hills {{quadrant}} of Atlanta, which contains {{the headquarters of the}} Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The restricted nature of the CDC campus meant that producers were only allowed to shoot exterior scenes of the area, as well as within <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> and reception area for the CDC's museum onsite. Principal photography then proceeded into Atlanta's central business district and Decatur, before advancing to London, Geneva, and lastly San Francisco, California, in the ensuing month. The San Francisco Film Commission charged filmmakers $300 per day for production within the city limits. In the North Beach and Potrero Hill sections of the city, production designer Howard Cummings scattered trash and discarded clothing on the ground to depict the rapid decline of civilization. For the Civic Center set, over 2,000 extras were sought for in background roles; actors who were a part of the Screen Actors Guild were paid $139 per day, while nonunion workers received $64 per day for their work. Other filming locations were established at Golden Gate Park, Chinatown, and Candlestick Park; it cost $60,000 to rent the football stadium for six days.|$|E
5|$|The Inquirers {{circulation}} {{has been}} dropping since the 1980s, {{and except for}} briefly seeing a rise in weekday circulation in 2007, The Philadelphia Inquirers weekday and Sunday circulation has continued to steadily drop since Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper. Loss of circulation combined with an unexpected drop in advertising revenue have forced more than 400 job cuts at The Inquirer and Daily News since they were bought by Philadelphia Media Holdings. As Philadelphia Media Holdings financial situation worsened in 2008 employees began complaining about how management has been monitoring things such as bathroom breaks and the coffee they drink, and that Tierney has been patrolling <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> seeing what time employees arrive for work. Despite efforts to manage the financial strain, on February 21, 2009, Philadelphia Newspapers LLC, the subsidiary of Philadelphia Media Holdings that owns the paper, filled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company hoped to restructure the US$390 million in debt it borrowed to buy the newspapers, but the end result was that the papers were auctioned off to the company's lenders. The beginning of 2009 also saw the filing of a lawsuit that accused The Philadelphia Inquirer of writing critical stories about Chester Community Charter School's use of public funds after business negotiations between school operator Vahan H. Gureghian and Tierney failed.|$|E
5|$|Voter {{approval}} of the referendum created a public‚Äìprivate partnership. The Washington State Public Stadium Authority was created to oversee public ownership of the stadium, exhibition center, and parking garage complex. Allen purchased the Seahawks and formed First & Goal Inc. to build and operate the facility. The budget for the project was $430million. Of this cost, $44million was allotted to build the Event Center, $26million for <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>garage,</b> and $360million for the stadium. First & Goal was to cover cost overruns and pay up to $130million of the project while the contribution from the public was capped at $300million. The public funding package included new sports-related state lottery games, taxes on the facility's admissions and parking, sales tax credits and deferrals, and an eight-year extension of the 2% tax on hotel rooms in King County. The taxes on admissions and parking are set at 2% {{to pay off the}} project's tax-exempt bonds. Those taxes will be kept below the authorized 10% to preserve the tax-exempt status, but the percentage will be increased to the full amount when the bonds are completely paid in 2021. At such time, they will become dedicated funding sources for maintenance and modernization of the facilities.|$|E

25|$|Parking at {{the station}} was {{originally}} difficult to find, but availability has improved over time. By July 1997, <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> at the Anacostia station was usually full by 9 A.M. on a weekday. But after the Green Line's final five stations opened in January 2001, <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> at the Anacostia station became underused. Ten years into its operation, <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> required refurbishing, but Metro put the project off for a year to pay for other projects. <b>The</b> <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> was one of 13 in the Metro system which had no waiting list for long-term parking as of February 2004. Its parking garage still did not fill up on workdays as of March 2005.|$|E
25|$|A major {{controversy}} over parking at the Anacostia station occurred as well. In 1981, Metro had proposed building 1,000 parking spaces in a three-level parking garage and 300 spaces at a ground-level {{parking lot at}} the station and using interstate highway funds to pay for them. Metro officials argued the facility was highway-related, since it provided parking, but the Federal Highway Administration refused to allow the District of Columbia use its funds to pay for <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>garage.</b> Local citizens also opposed <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> in favor of ground-level-only parking at the station, and demanded that Metro provide more connecting bus routes at the proposed station. These disagreements were put off as Metro officials and others focused on getting the Green Line built, but by 1985 <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> remained part of the station's overall transportation and construction plan. Metro solicited bids for an $11 million contract to build <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> in early 1985, but rejected all bids when the lowest bidder failed to meet minority-contracting standards. In May 1985, Metro officials still maintained that construction on <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> would begin in June.|$|E
