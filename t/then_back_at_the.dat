5|$|White House Astronomy Night (and {{alternatively}} Astronomy Night on the National Mall) is {{an event}} first organized by the White House {{in conjunction with the}} Office of Science and Technology Policy to motivate interest in astronomy and science education. The original White House Astronomy Night was held in 2009 on the South Lawn. In 2010 the White House and the Office of Science and Technology Policy organized a similar event with help from Hofstra University, this time held on the National Mall. Between 2010 and 2014 annual events took place at the National Mall with coordination between Hofstra University and federal agencies including: the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, NASA, and the National Science Foundation. In 2015 an event took place in June at the National Mall, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> White House again on October 19.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1933 monthly talks by Ford {{began with}} a {{regional}} conference of five communities held in Yonkers, New York. In February she spoke at the Bahá'í Center, March at a chapter of the Women's International League for Peace, April to the All-Gandhi World Fellowship, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bahá'í Center, May at the [...] "World's Good Will Day" [...] observance, June back at the Bahá'í Center, and in July, before going on to give talks at Green Acre later in July, and a Race Amity conference there in August, which is her last known appearance there. It was in July that she published recollections of her pilgrimage, and this race amity conference was noted in the Baha'i News as well. In August/September attended the 1933 World Parliament of Religions. In October Ford was at the Chicago Century of Progress Exposition {{as one of the}} representatives of the national community, as well as at a local community meeting in Toledo, Ohio. In November she helped celebrate the Bahá'í Holy Day of the Birth of Bahá'u'lláh at the Bahá'í Center, and then gave a talk another day. In December she gave talks in Binghamton, New York a few nights December also saw her publish an article on a portrait of `Abdu'l-Baha in Star of the West, which was echoed in Bahá'í World vol 5.|$|E
60|$|The miner glanced {{round at}} the heap of ore which betrayed his craft, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dark, bearded, impassive face.|$|E

50|$|A British {{merchant}} ship is torpedoed by a German U-Boat and takes shelter {{in a neutral}} port. <b>The</b> Captain <b>then</b> strikes <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> German enemy.|$|R
60|$|Sitka Charley {{looked at}} me in swift surprise, <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> picture. It was evident {{that he had not}} {{reasoned}} the impression.|$|E
60|$|The woman {{opened the}} door curiously, stared over Father's head at Mother, <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little man with his pink, cheery face and whiff of {{delicate}} silver hair.|$|E
6000|$|They {{looked at}} each other, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> closed door. “That man can {{scarcely}} hobble, and his hands are tied,” said one. “Go back and rattle at the lock, and he will {{think it is the}} key. Then if you are quick you may find Tomasa while I tell the Alcalde.” ...|$|E
60|$|Addressed thus directly, {{the manager}} allowed {{his gaze to}} wander from the ceiling. He eyed Psmith for a moment like an elderly basilisk, <b>then</b> looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ceiling again.|$|R
60|$|He laughed. It was {{absurd to}} admit it, but nothing had pleased {{him so much}} since the coming of his misfortune! She was {{thoughtful}} for some time, every now and <b>then</b> glancing <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> newspaper. Over their coffee she broke into a little reminiscent laugh.|$|R
60|$|James Van Teyl glanced curiously <b>at</b> <b>the</b> small, dark figure {{standing}} patiently before him, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> again <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wireless cable {{which he}} {{held in his}} fingers. He was just back from a tiring day in Wall Street, and was reclining in the most comfortable easy-chair of his Hotel Plaza sitting-room.|$|R
60|$|His friend {{stared at}} him aghast, but made no movement. He looked at the {{unconscious}} Poppy, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mouthing figure seated on the scuttle. His brain was numbed. Then a little performance on Charlie’s part {{a week or two}} before, which had cost that gentleman his berth, occurred to him, and he moved slowly forward.|$|E
60|$|Next {{they turned}} to the {{business}} table. On the desk, among the neat array of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the doctor's hand, the name of Mr. Utterson. The lawyer unsealed it, and several enclosures fell to the floor. The first was a will, drawn in the same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months before, {{to serve as a}} testament in case of death and as a deed of gift in case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the lawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John Utterson. He looked at Poole, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> paper, and last of all at the dead malefactor stretched upon the carpet.|$|E
60|$|Her {{husband was}} pleased that she should remain so long before them. And for a while, as she stood lost in contemplation, he did not speak. Once she glanced at him, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stern face of the General,--stern, yet kindly. The eyes, deep-set under bushy brows, like Hugh's, were full of fire; and yet the artist had made them human, too. A dark, reddish brown, close-trimmed {{mustache}} and beard hid the mouth and chin. Hugh had inherited the nose, but the father's forehead was wider and fuller. Hugh was at once a newer type, and an older. The face and figure of the General were characteristic of the mid-century American of the northern states, a mixture of boldness and caution and Puritanism, who had won his battles in war and commerce by a certain native quality of mind.|$|E
50|$|He foils this plot, <b>then</b> arrives <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> saloon, {{to arrest}} Charlie, {{but also because}} he {{is in love with}} her. Prince sneaks up {{intending}} to shoot Haven, but his bullet hits Charlie instead. Haven kills Prince and rushes to Charlie's side. She tells Haven she loves him before dying, and he that he loves her.|$|R
5000|$|The tour {{began on}} 1 July 2017 in Germany, with an {{individual}} time trial that started and finished in Düsseldorf. The flat course started alongside the Messe Düsseldorf and followed the right bank of the Rhine, southwards, before crossing <b>the</b> river <b>at</b> <b>the</b> [...] and <b>then</b> crossing <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> [...] After the intermediate time check <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Königsallee, the route headed back towards the Messe Düsseldorf.|$|R
60|$|A {{week later}} Frank and Harry and Jake sailed {{out in the}} sloop to {{intercept}} the south-bound steamer. She came up, with side-wheels churning a broad track of foam and her smoke trail streaming astern. When her engines stopped, Frank and Harry dropped into the canoe {{and in a few}} minutes they were alongside. Frank swung himself up on board and <b>then</b> looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> canoe.|$|R
60|$|Momaya {{threw herself}} at Tarzan's feet, raising supplicating hands {{toward him and}} pouring forth from her {{mutilated}} lips a perfect cataract of words, not one of which the ape-man comprehended. For a moment he looked down upon the upturned, frightful face of the woman. He had come to slay, but that overwhelming torrent of speech filled him with consternation and with awe. He glanced about him apprehensively, <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> woman. A revulsion of feeling seized him. He could not kill little Tibo's mother, nor could he stand and face this verbal geyser. With a quick gesture of impatience at the spoiling of his evening's entertainment, he wheeled and leaped away into the darkness. A moment later he was swinging through the black jungle night, the cries and lamentations of Momaya growing fainter in the distance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Then,</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> concert, {{the clock}} has struck midnight, {{and as the}} second set begins, Bill Graham can briefly be seen, riding in over the {{audience}} on {{a replica of the}} Golden Gate Bridge.|$|E
50|$|As a young man, Marsh {{developed}} {{a pattern of}} traveling and working for various employers. Marsh ran away at age 14 to Chester, Vermont, {{and worked as a}} farmer for three months. Then he left for Albany, New York, working as a waiter for 18 months. He spent two years working at the New York City Hotel, then returned to Albany for a year, and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> New York hotel for two more years. He also spent 18 months working as a groom for Edward Griswold on Long Island, New York.|$|E
50|$|Danby's {{atmospheric}} work An Enchanted Island, successfully {{exhibited in}} 1825 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> British Institution and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> in Bristol <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bristol Institution, was in turn particularly influential on other Bristol School artists.|$|R
50|$|An {{illusion}} turn (or simply illusion) {{is performed}} {{by keeping the}} working leg aligned with the torso while, simultaneously, a 360 degree spin is executed while the torso pivots down and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> up <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hip. An illusion can be performed by turning toward or away from the working leg; the latter {{is known as a}} reverse illusion. Illusions are commonly performed in jazz dance and rhythmic gymnastics.|$|R
50|$|Also in East Rutherford, Frank Krmel and Tom Meents {{performed}} a dual freestyle, with Frank Krmel driving the redesigned Inferno truck, and Tom Meents driving an FDNY tribute truck. Meents <b>then</b> came <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} show in Maximum Destruction and made an attempt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first ever double backflip. The attempt was unsuccessful, and the truck only made it about 1 and a quarter rotations before twisting and rolling over.|$|R
50|$|Lugg then {{appeared}} in small roles in three Arthur Wing Pinero plays at the Royal Court Theatre: The Magistrate, The Schoolmistress and Dandy Dick. He sang {{the role of}} Sergeant Bouncer in Cox & Box by F.C. Burnand and Arthur Sullivan, when it was revived at the Royal Court Theatre in 1888. Also in 1888, he appeared at the Olympic Theatre in Christina and at the Strand Theatre in Run Wild, Kleptomania and Aladdin. In 1889 at the Comedy Theatre, he played in Aesop's Fables, The Pink Dominos, Queen's Counsel and Domestic Economy. He was <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Strand as Nathaniel Glover in Our Flat. In 1891, he appeared at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in A Sailor's Knot.|$|E
5000|$|Bergling stayed as an UNTSO {{observer}} {{another year}} in the Middle East and returned home in January 1975, and was <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Security Service and the so-called [...] "Russian Division" [...] (Ryssroteln) where he previously worked. Bergling's contact, Alexander Nikiforov, had realized that as a newly acquired Soviet agent, Bergling {{would be able to}} do more good in Sweden. Back at Säpo, Bergling was instructed by the Soviets to investigate what the Soviet intelligence men did wrong. The errors were reported by Bergling to Moscow who called them back home. To get in touch with the Soviets he wrote letters with [...] "invisible writing", which was done with the help of carbon paper. The writings were then presented with a special liquid. He got messages back using a shortwave radio.|$|E

50|$|Skoropadenko’s Intellectual landscapes {{series has}} its roots in impressionism, with the oil {{paintings}} depicting minimalistic views that the artist sees on her travels. First sketched in situ and <b>then</b> painted <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> artist’s studio, lots of white ‘flesh’ is left on the canvas so that viewer can fill in the gaps. The Intellectual landscapes series got its first public viewing as a pop up exhibition <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Ukrainian Embassy in Brussels to celebrate Europe Day in 2016.|$|R
50|$|As {{required}} by Miranda v. Arizona, Spring was advised of his fifth amendment rights to protection against self-incrimination, an attorney, and silence when interrogated. Spring was actually reminded twice of his rights: {{first on the}} scene of <b>the</b> arrest, <b>then</b> again <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ATF office in Kansas City. However, Spring opted to waive them through written signature. He then voluntarily made a statement and answered questions regarding the ongoing investigation surrounding his involvement in illegal interstate firearms trafficking.|$|R
50|$|Ehrlinger {{was the son}} of {{the mayor}} of Giengen an der Brenz, a small town in southwestern Germany, in what is now the state of Baden-Württemberg. In 1928 he {{completed}} high school (Abitur) in Heidenheim, then studied law in Tübingen, Kiel, Berlin (where in 1931 he joined <b>the</b> SA) and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Tübingen. <b>The</b> nationalist and xenophobic atmosphere <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Tübingen (already by 1931 there were no longer any Jewish professors there) fit in well with his later legal career in the SD, the RSHA, and the Einsatzgruppen.|$|R
50|$|Hering then studied eye movements. He {{developed}} the Hering's law of equal innervation {{to describe the}} conjugacy of eye movements in animals. According to this law eye movements are always equal in intensity in the two eyes but not in direction. Eye movements can therefore be either conjugate (in the same direction such as saccades or smooth pursuit) or disjunctive (such as vergence eye movements). Hering's law of equal innervation is best described by Müller's stimulus where the fixation point changes position in 1 eye but not the other eye. Simplicity conducts that only the misaligned eye should move to refoveate. Hering's law predicts that because the eyes must always move by equal amounts, both eyes should move in the new binocular direction of the target (see Hering's law of visual direction above), then move in opposite direction to adjust vergence {{to that of the}} target. In other words, the eye in which the target did not move will move away and <b>then</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> target. This prediction was experimentally confirmed by Yarbus in his seminal work on eye movements. However it is now known that strong deviations from Hering's law exist.|$|E
50|$|Theodosia Throckmorton, {{a clever}} and shrewd girl of sorts, has the {{harrowing}} and busy work of nullifying curses in her father's museum, where the darkest spells abound. However, it is delicate work, {{and time is}} running out for her to set things right. A crate arrives from Theo's mother in Egypt, which contains a cursed statue of Bastet. While transferring the curse from the statue to a wax figure, she becomes distracted and redirects it into her cat, Isis. Her hands are full enough when her mother returns from the tombs of Egypt, bringing countless cursed valuables and antiquities with her. While picking her mother up at the train station, Theodosia catches a street urchin named Sticky Will trying to pick her father's pocket. He informs her that someone is following her mother. Theo tells him she will be at the station tomorrow and he can tell her more about the man <b>then.</b> <b>Back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> museum, they unload Theo's mother's trunks.Theo senses the curses on the artifacts. The most powerful is a gem called the Heart of Egypt, with the power to topple the whole of Great Britain and the entire British Empire.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Morris Townsend." [...] And as she {{pronounced}} her lover's name, Catherine {{looked at}} him. What she saw was her father's still grey eye and his clear-cut, definite smile.

50|$|Despite {{the pain}} and fatigue from injuries, a further {{competitive}} gear was found for Klassen {{as part of the}} women's team pursuit. She became a part of the team that first won gold <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2011 World Championships and <b>then</b> came <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2012 Worlds to win a silver as repeat medalists.

60|$|He took a reef in the counterpane {{and with}} {{a fair amount of}} dignity, {{considering}} his appearance, stalked upstairs again and stood gloomily considering affairs in his bedroom. Ever since Gladys and Dorothy had been big enough to be objects of interest to the young men of the neighbourhood the clothes nuisance had been rampant. He peeped through <b>the</b> window-blind <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bright sunshine outside, and <b>then</b> looked <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tumbled bed. A murmur of voices downstairs apprised him that the conspirators were awaiting the result.|$|R
