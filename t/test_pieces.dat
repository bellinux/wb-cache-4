5|$|Early in 1794, {{engraver}} Robert Scot began preparing {{designs for}} the silver dollar. Scot's initial design depicted a bust of Liberty, while his reverse featured an eagle, both required by the 1792 Coinage Act. Scot's design closely followed his design for the cent, but with the Phrygian cap removed. Government officials later instructed Scot to include a wreath around the eagle and to move the denomination from the reverse face {{to the edge of}} the coin. After receiving approval, Scot began engraving the hubs for the new silver dollar. Extra care was taken during the engraving of this denomination, because the dollar would be the largest American coin, and would thus receive the most scrutiny from foreign nations. The lettering was executed by Frederick Geiger, who had worked as a typographer for various books and newspapers. After the dies were created, several copper <b>test</b> <b>pieces</b> were struck. Officials decided to add fifteen stars around the periphery, representing the fifteen states that had ratified the Constitution to that point, to the right-facing Liberty on the obverse.|$|E

The <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> was cut to a width of 15.0  ±  0.1  mm and length of 250  ±  1  mm. The maximum load at failure of the <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> was measured with a tensile tester at a chuck interval of 180  ±  1  mm and tension speed of 20  mm/min. The elongation when the test sample broke owing to tension was measured, and the tensile elongation ratio was calculated. In both tests, the measurement {{was carried out in}} the longitudinal direction only. In addition, the <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> was swollen with water for 1  h.

40|$|The present {{invention}} is {{a method}} and system for detecting a physical feature of a <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> by detecting a pattern in a signal representing data from inspection of the <b>test</b> <b>piece.</b> The pattern is detected by automated additive decomposition of a digital point-ordered signal which represents the data. The present invention can properly handle a non-periodic signal. A physical parameter of the <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> is measured. A digital point-ordered signal representative of the measured physical parameter is generated. The digital point-ordered signal is decomposed into a baseline signal, a background noise signal, and a peaks/troughs signal. The peaks/troughs from the peaks/troughs signal are located and peaks/troughs information indicating the physical feature of the <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> is output...|$|R

30|$|The Clark {{stiffness}} {{of the paper}} was measured in compliance with JIS-P 8143 [14]. A <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> with a width of 30  mm and length of 80  mm was sandwiched between two rollers that can be rotated in the clockwise and counterclockwise directions. The critical length of the <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> was measured; the critical length is {{the length of the}} <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> when it bends at an angle (critical turning angle) of 90 °, caused by its empty weight, with the rotation of the rollers.

40|$|AbstractThe micro rebound {{hardness}} test is characterized by using a small and hard ball as an impact element and measuring the restitution coefficient of the ball against the <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> as a hardness property of the <b>test</b> <b>piece.</b> In this study, {{in order to determine}} the specifications for the prototype tester presently under development, the features of the restitution coefficient measured by the test were investigated by computer simulation.

An exception to this is when determining the suitability of a <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> for use in Class 1 cleanrooms in accordance with DIN EN ISO 14644-1: such tests have to be carried out in a Class 1 cleanroom because no other cleanroom classes are defined which are better than this. The test cleanroom must have a low-turbulence airflow (often known as laminar in this context) in order to prove high air cleanliness classes and also accurately locate particle sources.|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{deals with}} the effect of novel {{gripping}} systems developed for tensile testing on the stress distribution inside the <b>test</b> <b>piece.</b> The uniformity of the stress distribution plays a decisive role in measuring the upper yield strength and creep behavior of materials. In this study two modified versions of a recently developed gripping system are introduced and tested together with the original version. The tests consist of measuring the bending stress/axial stress ration during elastic loading of the <b>test</b> <b>piece.</b> The bending stress/average stress ratio was measured using a special strain gauge mounted <b>test</b> <b>piece,</b> which was loaded by elastic tension. The {{results show that the}} gripping systems provide the self-alignment of the <b>test</b> <b>piece</b> {{at the beginning of the}} loading; therefore they can ensure almost true uniaxial conditions for tensile testing. The average bending stress/axial stress ratio is found to be just 1 - 2 %, so, the gripping systems can provide the accurate measurement of upper yield strength and creep curves of materials...|$|R
