Some 250 of <b>these</b> <b>genes</b> are more specifically expressed in the thyroid with about 20 genes being highly thyroid specific. The corresponding specific proteins are mainly involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, such as thyroglobulin, TPO and IYD, and expressed in follicular cells.

5|$|Classic {{genome-wide}} {{linkage analysis}} has identified nine loci on different chromosomes associated with psoriasis. They are called psoriasis susceptibility 1 through 9 (PSORS1 through PSORS9). Within those loci are genes on pathways {{that lead to}} inflammation. Certain variations (mutations) of those genes are commonly found in psoriasis. Genome-wide association scans have identified other genes that are altered to characteristic variants in psoriasis. Some of <b>these</b> <b>genes</b> express inflammatory signal proteins, which affect cells in the immune system that are also involved in psoriasis.

5|$|The {{field is}} characterised by some key concepts, which took {{biologists}} by surprise. One is deep homology, {{the finding that}} dissimilar organs such as the eyes of insects, vertebrates and cephalopod molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as pax-6, from the evo-devo gene toolkit. <b>These</b> <b>genes</b> are ancient, being highly conserved among phyla; they generate the patterns {{in time and space}} which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes; what does differ is the way that gene expression is regulated by the toolkit genes. <b>These</b> <b>genes</b> are reused, unchanged, many times {{in different parts of the}} embryo and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple pleiotropic reuse explains why <b>these</b> <b>genes</b> are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which natural selection would oppose.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{diagnosis}} in HHT is difficult, as mutations {{occur in}} numerous different {{locations in the}} linked genes, without particular mutations being highly frequent (as opposed to, for instance, the ΔF508 mutation in cystic fibrosis). Sequence analysis of the involved genes is therefore the most useful approach (sensitivity 75%), followed by additional testing to detect large deletions and duplications (additional 10%). Not all mutations in <b>these</b> <b>genes</b> have been linked with disease.|$|E

In the genome of Mnemiopsis leidyi ten genes encode photoproteins. <b>These</b> <b>genes</b> are co-expressed with opsin genes in the developing photocytes of Mnemiopsis leidyi, raising the possibility that light production and light detection may be working together in these animals.|$|E
5|$|In {{some species}} of RNA virus, the genes {{are not on}} a {{continuous}} molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA.

The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E
5|$|Genes with a {{most recent}} common ancestor, {{and thus a}} shared {{evolutionary}} ancestry, are known as homologs. <b>These</b> <b>genes</b> appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where they are known as paralogous genes, or {{are the result of}} divergence of the genes after a speciation event, where they are known as orthologous genes, and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms.

40|$|Reproductive {{senescence}} is {{a hallmark}} of aging. The molecular mechanisms regulating reproductive senescence and its association with the aging of somatic cells remain poorly understood. From a full genome RNA interference (RNAi) screen, we identified 32 Caenorhabditis elegans gene inactivations that delay reproductive senescence and extend reproductive lifespan. We found that many of <b>these</b> <b>gene</b> inactivations interact with insulin/IGF- 1 and/or TGF-b endocrine signaling pathways to regulate reproductive senescence, except nhx- 2 and sgk- 1 that modulate sodium reabsorption. Of <b>these</b> 32 <b>gene</b> inactivations, {{we also found that}} 19 increase reproductive lifespan through their effects on oocyte activities, 8 of them coordinate oocyte and sperm functions to extend reproductive lifespan, and 5 of them can induce sperm humoral response to promote reproductive longevity. Furthermore, we examined the effects of these reproductive aging regulators on somatic aging. We found that 5 of <b>these</b> <b>gene</b> inactivations prolong organismal lifespan, and 20 of them increase healthy life expectancy of an organism without altering total life span.

40|$|GSK- 3 InsulinIGFBP- 1 gene transcriptionTIRECHIR 99021 Background: Hepatic {{expression}} of several gene products involved in glucose metabolism, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), glucose- 6 -phosphatase (G 6 Pase) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 1 (IGFBP- 1), is rapidly and completely inhibited by insulin. This inhibition is mediated through {{the regulation of}} a DNA element present in each of <b>these</b> <b>gene</b> promoters, that we call the Thymine-rich Insulin Response Element (TIRE). The insulin signalling pathway that results in the inhibition of <b>these</b> <b>gene</b> promoters requires the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase). However, the molecules that connect PI 3 -kinase to <b>these</b> <b>gene</b> promoters are not yet fully defined. Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK- 3) is inhibited following activation of PI 3 -kinase. We have shown previously that inhibitors of GSK- 3 reduce the activity of two TIRE-containing gene promoters (PEPCK and G 6 Pase), whose products are required for gluconeogenesis. Results: In this report we demonstrate that in H 4 IIE-C 3 cells, four distinct classes of GSK- 3 inhibitor mimic the effect of insulin on a third TIRE-containing gene, IGFBP- 1.

5|$|Homologous {{sequences}} are paralogous if {{they were}} created by a duplication event within the genome. For gene duplication events, if a gene in an organism is duplicated to occupy two different positions in the same genome, then the two copies are paralogous. Paralogous genes often {{belong to the same}} species. They can shape the structure of whole genomes and thus explain genome evolution to a large extent. Examples include the Homeobox (Hox) genes in animals. <b>These</b> <b>genes</b> not only underwent gene duplications within chromosomes but also whole genome duplications. As a result, Hox genes in most vertebrates are clustered across multiple chromosomes with the HoxA-D clusters being the best studied.|$|E
5|$|In the {{so-called}} modern {{synthesis of the}} early 20th century, Ronald Fisher brought together Darwin's theory of evolution, with its insistence on natural selection, heredity, and variation, and Gregor Mendel's laws of genetics into a coherent structure for evolutionary biology. Biologists assumed that an organism was a straightforward reflection of its component genes: the genes coded for proteins, which built the organism's body. Biochemical pathways (and, they supposed, new species) evolved through mutations in <b>these</b> <b>genes.</b> It was a simple, clear and nearly comprehensive picture: {{but it did not}} explain embryology.|$|E
5|$|MS is not {{considered}} a hereditary disease; however, a number of genetic variations {{have been shown to}} increase the risk. Some of <b>these</b> <b>genes</b> appear to have higher levels of expression in microglial cells than expected by chance.

In identical twins both are affected about 30% of the time, while around 5% for non-identical twins and 2.5% of siblings are affected with a lower percentage of half-siblings. If both parents are affected the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population. MS is also more common in some ethnic groups than others.|$|E
