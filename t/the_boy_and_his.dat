5|$|The duo finally {{returns to}} Omnitopia and finds Ruffleberg, who {{explains}} everything. He and his butler Carltron once engaged in chess matches. Ruffleberg outfitted {{him with an}} intelligence chip {{to make him a}} more challenging opponent, but the upgrade backfired by making Carltron more malevolent. He sabotaged the transporter to Evermore and designed the hostile beasts roaming the game. With Ruffleberg's help, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> canine companion break into Carltron's room. The area is guarded by android clones of <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> dog, along with a giant mecha version of Carltron. At the last moment, Ruffleberg appears and deactivates Carltron, who promptly freezes in place.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Provost {{declined}} to renew his contract. Producers decided {{to broaden the}} show's demographics to appeal to older viewers, and, to that end, dropped <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> dog theme for a plot featuring a Forest Service Ranger. Robert Bray, a former Marine and Gary Cooper look-alike was cast as Corey Stuart. During Bray's first year, the show transitioned to color filming and spectacular scenic locations across America were exploited as settings for the show. Eventually, Bray's alcoholism forced him from the show, and Jack De Mave and Jed Allan were hired to replace him.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Secret of Evermore follows {{a boy and}} his pet dog as they are {{inadvertently}} transported to a fantasy world created by an eccentric inventor. The player guides both <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> shapeshifting dog through Evermore, {{a world that is}} composed of separate realms, each resembling a different period of real-world history. The gameplay shares many similarities with Secret of Mana, such as real-time battles, a ring-shaped menu system, and the ability to switch control between the two characters. Despite similar game mechanics and a similar title, it is not an entry in the Mana series.|$|E

5|$|From 1210 on, Michael I Komnenos Doukas {{was engaged}} in a {{campaign}} of expansion, chiefly {{at the expense of}} the Latin Kingdom of Thessalonica to his east; after initial reverses, much of Thessaly was conquered. By 1214, Dyrrhachium and Corfu had been recovered from the Latins as well. The traditional view of historians is that these events marked Michael I's repudiation of the allegiance he had sworn to the Latin Empire, but historian Philip Van Tricht argues that both Michael and later Theodore remained, at least in theory, vassals of the Latin Empire until 1217. Michael was assassinated by a servant in late 1214 or in 1215. As Michael II was illegitimate and too young, Theodore had no trouble in sidelining the boy. According to the hagiography of St. Theodora of Arta, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> mother spent the duration of his reign exiled in the Peloponnese.|$|E
5|$|In each of {{the four}} realms, the boy {{encounters}} a citizen of Podunk involved in the original experiment gone awry 30 years ago. Professor Sidney Ruffleberg and his three companions were transported to Evermore, but are unable to leave. The boy quickly learns that the regions are manifestations of those citizens' personal utopias. Each of the three companions act as the ruler of his or her world: Elizabeth, the Professor's niece, is the tribal chief of Prehistoria; Horace Highwater, curator of the Podunk Museum, oversees Antiqua; Camellia Bluegarden, a portly librarian, is the Queen of Gothica; and Professor Ruffleberg monitors everything from Omnitopia, with his android butler, Carltron, alongside him. Within Prehistoria, Antiqua, and Gothica, <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> canine companion aid Elizabeth, Horace, and Camellia in thwarting attempts by robotic clones of the Podunk citizens from ruling their respective areas.|$|E
5|$|Richard's reign {{began in}} 1483. At {{the request of}} his brother Edward IV, Richard was acting as Lord Protector for his son Edward V. Richard had Parliament declare Edward V illegitimate and ineligible for the throne, and took it for himself. Richard lost {{popularity}} when <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> younger brother disappeared after he incarcerated them in the Tower of London, and his support was further eroded by the popular belief that he was implicated {{in the death of}} his wife. Across the English Channel in Brittany, Henry Tudor, a descendant of the greatly diminished House of Lancaster, seized on Richard's difficulties so that he could challenge his claim to the throne. Henry's first attempt to invade England was frustrated by a storm in 1483, but on his second attempt he arrived unopposed on 7 August 1485 on the southwest coast of Wales. Marching inland, Henry gathered support as he made for London. Richard mustered his troops and intercepted Henry's army south of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire. Thomas, Lord Stanley, and Sir William Stanley brought a force to the battlefield, but held back while they decided which side it would be more advantageous to support.|$|E

5|$|The game's plot {{describes}} {{a journey through}} a child's emotions and anxieties. After befriending the monster, the boy leaves Earth on the creature's back to look for life elsewhere in the galaxy. He hopes {{to find someone to}} relate to. The hollow planet Gravida's surface is patrolled by a creature that complains of stomach pains. This larger creature is followed by several tiny creatures, some of which ride on its back. One of these smaller inhabitants has fallen into the core of Gravida. Though it is isolated and lonely, the creature consoles itself that nobody can harm it. The planet Malaisus is composed of water, with a monster identical to the player's swimming around with a shoal of fish. The monster tells the player to leave. Planet Bibulon has two faces on opposite sides, one angry and one happy. A two-faced creature travels across the surface; one is happy and the other morose. Bibulon is orbited by four moons, each of which has differing opinions on an unnamed man or boy. When players find the planet Debasa, they discover that it is surrounded by a green fog. Gravity is very intense within the fog. Four orbiting satellites produce the fog, which has trapped two boys. Earth shrinks slightly after each planet has been completed. After restoring color to all the surrounding planets, the game is completed by returning to Earth. The Earth has shrunk until it is only slightly larger than the monster; it is destroyed when <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> monster land. Both fly upwards and land on the moon, where the boy is free to craft a future of his choosing.|$|E

Gore initially supported Republican legislation to give <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> father permanent residence status, but later supported the administration position.

25|$|Several {{structured}} camping {{activities are}} available in the Cub Scout program. The pack overnighter is a pack-organized camping activity that provides Cub Scouts with positive outdoor experiences. Cub Scout day camp or twilight camp is an accredited, organized, one- to five-day program for Cub Scouts using trained leadership at an approved site, and is usually held during daylight or early evening hours, but not overnight. Cub Scout resident camp is an organized, accredited overnight camping program covering at least two nights and conducted under trained leadership in an established Scout camp operated by the council. The Webelos den overnight camp introduces <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> parent to the camping program, under the leadership of the Webelos den leader.

500|$|In 1957, Jack Wrather, {{owner of}} the hit {{television}} series The Lone Ranger and Sergeant Preston of the Yukon purchased all rights to the Lassie television show for $3.25 million, and guided the show through its next several seasons. [...] As 1964 and the show's eleventh season approached, {{the decision was made}} to completely rework the show; <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> dog theme was dropped and Lassie was teamed with a succession of United States Forest Service workers. The show focused on conservation and environmentalism, but its relevance in a time of social change was questioned. The show began a steady decline in ratings. In 1971, new rulings regarding network prime time scheduling were handed down from the Federal Communications Commission, and CBS canceled the show. Lassie then entered first-run syndication for two seasons before televising its last new episode on Sunday March 25, 1973.|$|E
500|$|Further {{accusations of}} child sexual abuse were made in 2003, by 13-year-old Gavin Arvizo. The {{allegations}} came after Jackson and the boy appeared in the documentary Living with Michael Jackson, in which the entertainer stated that he shared his bed with children in a non-sexual fashion. The musician was subsequently indicted on four counts of molesting a minor, four counts of intoxicating a minor, one count of abduction, and one count of conspiring to hold <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family captive at Neverland Ranch. During the five-month trial, Jackson faced allegations of child molestation and assertions that he had attempted to abduct the Arvizo family in a hot air balloon. He denied all the charges and family members proclaimed that he was the victim of an extortion attempt. One friend, Firpo Carr, expressed amazement at the allegations leveled against the singer, who at the time was living at Neverland Ranch. [...] "I'm surprised they haven't accused him of bestiality because he also has a zoo there. I mean, it gets ridiculous after a while." [...] On June 13, 2005, the jury found Jackson not guilty on all charges.|$|E
500|$|Secret of Evermore {{takes many}} of its {{interface}} and gameplay aspects from Secret of Mana. The game mostly consists of an aerial view setting, in which <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> dog negotiate the terrain and fend off hostile creatures. [...] If the boy is currently selected as the player character, his dog will be controlled by the artificial intelligence, and vice versa. Both characters can find refuge in caves or a town, where they can regain their hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, either character can increase in level with improved stats such as strength and evasion. Options including changing equipment, casting alchemy spells, or checking status can be quickly performed by rotating through the game's Action Ring system. Combat takes place in real-time. Located below the players hit points is a percentage gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy, {{as well as how}} far the player can run. Swinging a weapon or running causes the gauge to fall to 0% and then quickly recharges, allowing the character to attack at full strength or to run at full sprint once it is full. The gauge may also fill up to allowing the player to use charged attacks with equipped weapons.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from July 16, 1910. It states: [...] "A shot that found a fortune! Jack Hunt, {{the son of a}} wealthy woman, falls in love with Nell Horsley, who is in the chorus of a musical comedy. They are married, but when Jack's mother is informed she declares she'll {{have nothing to do with}} Nell, although she is willing to forgive her son. But Jack sticks to his wife, and for a time they are very happy. Then Jack, who is in the militia, is called out on strike duty, and meets his death during a fight with strikers. The widow takes the news to her mother-in-law, who nevertheless retains her hatred for Nell, despite the tragedy. As time passes, Mrs. Hunt becomes a miser. She disposes of all of her property, receiving in exchange money and jewels which she hides in a secret place in her room. In the meantime Nell has a hard time to get along and keep a roof over her head and that of her little boy. So desperate are her circumstances that she finally sinks her pride and appeals to her mother-in-law. The old woman repulses her again; her fit of rage brings on a stroke of apoplexy and she drops dead after Nell leaves. All her property goes to little George, as the woman left no will, but search fails to locate anything except the family homestead. Nell is about to sell that, when she makes a discovery. Playing 'Indian' with her boy, she shoots arrows aimlessly about the room. One of them hits the secret spring of the treasure vault, and the accident puts <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> mother beyond want for the rest of their lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Walton {{was born}} into a musical family in Oldham, Lancashire, the second son in a family of three boys and a girl. His father, Charles Alexander Walton, was a {{musician}} who had trained at the Royal Manchester College of Music under Charles Hallé, and made a living as a singing teacher and church organist. Charles's wife, Louisa Maria (née Turner), had been a singer before their marriage. William Walton's musical talents were spotted when he was still a young boy, and he took piano and violin lessons, though he never mastered either instrument. He was more successful as a singer: he and his elder brother sang in their father's choir, taking part in performances of large-scale works by Handel, Haydn, Mendelssohn and others. Walton was sent to a local school, but in 1912 his father saw a newspaper advertisement for probationer choristers at Christ Church Cathedral School in Oxford and applied for William to be admitted. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> mother missed their intended train from Manchester to Oxford because Walton's father had spent the money for the fare in a local public house. Louisa Walton had to borrow the fares from a greengrocer. Although they arrived in Oxford after the entrance trials were over, Mrs Walton successfully pleaded for her son to be heard, and he was accepted. He remained at the choir school for the next six years. The Dean of Christ Church, Dr Thomas Strong, noted the young Walton's musical potential and was encouraged in this view by Sir Hubert Parry, who saw the manuscripts of some of Walton's early compositions and said to Strong, [...] "There's a lot in this chap; you must keep your eye on him." ...|$|E
