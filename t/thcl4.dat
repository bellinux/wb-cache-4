25|$|Commercial {{samples of}} zinc {{chloride}} typically contain water and products from hydrolysis as impurities. Such samples may be purified by recrystallization from hot dioxane. Anhydrous samples can be purified by sublimation {{in a stream}} of hydrogen chloride gas, followed by heating the sublimate to 400°C in a stream of dry nitrogen gas. Finally, the simplest method relies on treating the zinc chloride with thionyl chloride., ZnCl2, CdCl2, <b>ThCl4,</b> CrCl3, FeCl3, CoCl2, and NiCl2 from the corresponding hydrates.|$|E
25|$|Thorium {{tetrachloride}} (<b>ThCl4,</b> white, m.p.770°C) {{is produced}} by heating thoria in an organochloride compound such as carbon tetrachloride. The usual method of purification is crystallisation from an aqueous solution and then heating the product above 100°C to dehydrate it. Further purification {{can be achieved by}} subliming it. Its melting and boiling points are respectively 770°C and 921°C. It undergoes a phase transition at 405°C, with a low-temperature α phase and high-temperature β phase. Nevertheless, the β phase usually persists below the transition temperature. Both phases crystallise in the tetragonal crystal system and the structural differences are small. Below −203°C, a low-temperature form exists with a complex structure.|$|E
5000|$|Thorium(IV) {{chloride}} (<b>ThCl4)</b> is an {{inorganic chemical}} compound. In {{addition to the}} anhydrous <b>ThCl4,</b> two hydrates have been reported: ThCl4(H2O)4 and ThCl4(H2O)8. [...] These hydroscopic salts are water-soluble and white, at room temperature. Similar to other thorium complexes thorium(IV) chloride has a high melting point 770 °C (1,418 °F) and a boiling point of 921 °C (1,690 °F). Like all the other actinides, thorium is radioactive and has sometimes {{been used in the}} production of nuclear energy. Thorium(IV) chloride does not appear naturally but instead is derived from Thorite, Thorianite, or Monazite which are naturally occurring formations.|$|E
50|$|Another {{less common}} method of {{synthesis}} relies on heating thorium metal with NH4Cl at 300 °C for 30 h making a (NH4)2ThCl6. This product is then heated at 350 °C under a high vacuum to produce <b>ThCl4.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{reaction}} <b>ThCl₄</b> with 4 equivalents {{of sodium}} N,N-dimethylaminodiboranate, Na(H₃BNMe₂BH₃), in tetrahydrofuran produces the new complex Th(H₃BNMe₂BH₃) ₄. The thorium center forms bonds with fifteen hydrogen atoms; accordingly, {{this is the}} first example of a fifteen-coordinate atom of any kind. As determined by both single crystal X-ray and single crystal neutron diffraction studies, the eight boron atoms describe an approximate D₂d dodecahedral structure in which seven of the Th•••B distances lie between 2. 88 and 2. 95 Å, but the eighth is significantly longer at 3. 19 Å. Two hydrogen atoms on each boron atom bridge each of the short Th•••B contacts, but only one bridges the long Th•••B contact. Quantum chemical calculations suggest that Th(H₃BNMe₂BH₃) ₄ is 16 -coordinate in the gas phase and that the 15 -coordinate solid-state structure can be attributed to packing effects. Compound 1 reacts at elevated temperatures (80 – 110 °C) to produce (NMe₂BH₂) ₂ and the mixed aminodiboranate/tetrahydroborate complex Th(H₃BNMe₂BH₃) ₂(BH₄) ₂; the reaction proceeds through the Th(H₃BNMe₂BH₃) ₃(BH₄) intermediate. The structure of the fifteen-coordinate Th(H₃BNMe₂BH₃) ₂(BH₄) ₂(thf) is also described...|$|E
