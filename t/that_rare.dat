5|$|Rare's Blast Corps began a run {{of seven}} highly lauded and {{respected}} Nintendo 64 games, including GoldenEye 007, Banjo-Kazooie, Perfect Dark, and Jet Force Gemini. Retro Gamer wrote <b>that</b> <b>Rare</b> had doubled the number of classic Nintendo 64 games and was an important alliance for Nintendo. Microsoft acquired Rare in 2002 for a record price of $377 million. The industry had changed, Blast Corps designer Martin Wakeley reflected {{a decade after the}} game's 1997 release. In 2009, Wakeley said, a studio would rarely entrust the scope of a project like Blast Corps to a team of four recent graduates.|$|E
5|$|Star Fox Adventures is an action-adventure video game, {{developed}} by Rare {{and published by}} Nintendo. Although the game's original concept was intended for the Nintendo 64, Shigeru Miyamoto convinced Rare to re-design the game to be both {{a part of the}} Star Fox series and as a launch title for the GameCube. The game was released on 23 September 2002, and was the final Nintendo game <b>that</b> <b>Rare</b> developed, before it was acquired by Microsoft {{to be a part of}} its Xbox division the day after the game's release in North America. The game's story takes place after the events of Star Fox 64, in which players take control of Fox McCloud who is sent on a mission to visit a planet in the Lylat System and save it from destruction.|$|E
5|$|With {{two outs}} in the 9th inning {{of a game}} against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 28, 1998, Bonds became only the fifth player in {{baseball}} history to be given an intentional walk with the bases loaded. Nap Lajoie (1901), Del Bissonette (1928) and Bill Nicholson (1944) were three others in the 20th century who received <b>that</b> <b>rare</b> honor. The first to receive one was Abner Dalrymple in 1881. During {{a game against the}} Philadelphia Phillies on August 2, Bonds was hit by a pitch thrown by Ricky Bottalico, leading to Bonds charging the mound and triggering a bench-clearing brawl.|$|E

5|$|In November 2011, Kaye {{announced}} that particles of pure (unalloyed) titanium {{had also been}} found on the tie. He explained that titanium, which was much rarer in the 1970s than it is today, {{was at that time}} found only in metal fabrication or production facilities, or at chemical companies using it (combined with aluminum) to store extremely corrosive substances. The findings suggested that Cooper may have been a chemist or a metallurgist, or possibly an engineer or manager (the only employees who wore ties in such facilities at that time) in a metal or chemical manufacturing plant, or at a company that recovered scrap metal from those types of factories. In January 2017, Kaye reported <b>that</b> <b>rare</b> earth minerals such as cerium and strontium sulfide had also been identified among particles from the tie. One of the rare applications for such elements in the 1970s was Boeing's supersonic transport development project, suggesting the possibility that Cooper was a Boeing employee. Other possible sources of the material included plants that manufactured cathode ray tubes, such as the Portland firms Teledyne and Tektronix.|$|E

25|$|The {{rediscovery of}} the takahē in 1948 after none {{had been seen}} since 1898 showed <b>that</b> <b>rare</b> birds can exist undiscovered for a long time.

Besides being his first book, The Immense Journey was also Eiseley's most well known book and established him as a writer with the ability to combine science and humanity in a poetic way. This book was originally published in 1946. Then, it was published again in 1957, a few years after the Piltdown Man hoax discovery.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Rare created Diddy Kong's {{model with}} the intent that it be their update of Donkey Kong Jr. Nintendo felt that the model was too great a {{departure}} from Donkey Kong Jr.'s original look, and insisted <b>that</b> <b>Rare</b> either re-work it to match Donkey Kong Jr.'s original appearance or present it as a new character entirely.

Following a supporting role in the independent film Without Evidence (1995), she starred in her first Hollywood picture, Hackers (1995). The New York Times critic Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Kate stands out.

500|$|The {{gameplay}} was highlighted for {{the size}} of the game's worlds.

Similarly, GamePro remarked that the game is so large that players might lose their way and forget what they are supposed to do. GameSpot's Shane Satterfield praised the game's level design and progression for constantly requiring players to collect Jiggies. Despite the praise, Edge concluded <b>that</b> <b>Rare</b> should have innovated more instead of simply copying the formula of Super Mario 64. At the 2000 GameSpot Game of the Year awards, Banjo-Tooie was awarded Best Platform Game.|$|E
