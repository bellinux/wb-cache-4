40|$|Alendronate {{is one of}} {{the best}} and most {{extensively}} studied bisphosphonates in the treatment of osteoporosis. This review considers in detail the major pivotal study, the fracture intervention <b>trial</b> (<b>FIT),</b> upon which the use of alendronate is based and which was a landmark study in terms of design, size and clinical impact. The role of alendronate has subsequently been underscored by a range of studies extending the clinical indications for its use and consolidating the effect on reducing both vertebral and non-vertebral fracture risk. Although the emphasis of these studies has predominantly been on the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis, data is also available in primary prevention, men, and glucocorticoids-induced osteoporosis. Direct comparison between the different drugs used to treat osteoporosis with fracture end points are needed for patients and doctors to make informed choices, but the size of such studies are prohibitive. Clinical trials using surrogate markers such as bone mineral density and biochemical markers of bone turnover have been performed which provide some helpful information but the limitations of this approach need to be recognized...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a system for}} estimating the epicardial surface of the heart using data obtained from biplane coronary cin&ngiograms. The 3 -dimensional(3 D) geometry of the left coronary arterial tree at an instant in time is interactively reconstructed as an ensemble of 3 D Btzier cubits. This provides a compact representation of the tree structure, incorporating the 3 D location of the bifurcation points and their connectivity {{as well as the}} locii of the connecting vessels. A finite element model for the surface is defined using bicubic Hermite basis functions to interpolate prolate spheroidal geometric parameters. As the arteries are not uniformly distributed around the left ventricular epicardium, weighted spline-type smoothness con-straints are incorporated into the error function along with the least squares error estimate. A <b>trial</b> <b>fit</b> to data describing the superticisl arteries of an isolated dog heart was compared to a uniform and dense data set covering the entire epicardial surface obtained from the same heart. Good agreement was found in elements containing coronary data, with the error increasing in a controlled manner in the remaining elements.

This study of minimal residual disease was undertaken in parallel, to determine the rate of conversion from bcl- 2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -detectable to -undetectable status and the corresponding effect on progression-free survival (PFS). PATIENTS AND METHODS Blood samples from 414 patients ((90) Y-ibritumomab, n = 208; control, n = 206) were evaluated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR); 186 {{were found to have}} the bcl- 2 rearrangement and were thus eligible for inclusion in the RQ-PCR analysis. Results Overall, 90 % of treated patients converted from bcl- 2 PCR-detectable to -undetectable disease status, compared with 36 % in the control group.

40|$|Background: The Fracture Intervention <b>Trial</b> (<b>FIT)</b> {{showed that}} the bisphosphonate alendronate {{reduces the risk of}} {{fractures}} in women with low bone mass in the United States. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness (cost per life-year gained and cost per quality-adjusted life-year, QALY, gained) of treating osteoporotic women in Denmark with alendronate, compared with no treatment. Design: A Markov model earlier used in the economic evaluation for Sweden was adapted using epidemiological and cost data for Denmark. In the base-case alendronate was assumed to have a fracture-risk reducing effect for ten years; a treatment duration period of 5 years followed by a 5 -year period where the effect declined linearly to zero. Results: Treating a 71 -year old (the mean age in the vertebral arm of the FIT) osteoporotic woman with one prior vertebral fracture with alendronate was found to be associated with a cost of DKK 52, 311 per QALY gained. The cost-effectiveness ratio when treating a 69 -year old woman with low bone mass and without previous vertebral fractures was higher (DKK 205, 816) but still within the limits of what can be considered good value for money.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} an incentive-based {{intervention to}} increase time spent outdoors among {{children in a}} 9 -month cluster randomised controlled trial. Methods: Two hundred and eighty-five children aged 6 - 12 years of age were randomised to the intervention (n = 147) or control arm (n = 138) in the Family incentive <b>trial</b> (<b>FIT).</b> The FIT intervention comprised of targeted education on myopia and good eye care habits, structured weekend outdoor activities and incentives for children to increase their daily steps via pedometers. The main outcome measure was outdoor time, measured by the WHO questionnaire and a 1 -week diary. Results: Interim analysis at 6 months showed {{a significant increase in}} mean outdoor time per week in the intervention arm (14. 75 h week- 1) compared to the control arm (12. 40 h week- 1) as measured by the questionnaire (p = 0. 04). However, greater outdoor time was not statistically significant {{at the end of the}} trial (15. 95 h week- 1 vs 14. 34 h in the control group (p = 0. 29). Conclusions: There was an increase in outdoor time for children in the incentive-based physical activity outdoor program after 6 months but not at the end of the trial. Further larger school trials with better compliance with the intervention and longer duration could be conducted to evaluate clinical outcomes such as myopic shifts. © 2014 The College of Optometrists.

40|$|Background. Tools {{chosen to}} measure poststroke upper-extremity {{rehabilitation}} outcomes must match contemporary theoretical expectations of motor deficit and recovery because an assessment’s theoretical underpinning forms the conceptual basis for interpreting its score. Objective. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the theoretical framework of the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) by (1) determining whether all items measured a single underlying trait and (2) examining the congruency between the hypothesized and the empirically determined item difficulty orders. Methods. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Rasch analysis were applied to existing WMFT Functional Ability Rating Scale data from 189 participants in the EXCITE (Extremity Constraint-Induced Therapy Evaluation) <b>trial.</b> <b>Fit</b> of a 1 -factor CFA model (all items) was compared with the fit of a 2 -factor CFA model (factors defined according to item object-grasp requirements) with fit indices, model comparison test, and interfactor correlations. Results. One item was missing sufficient data and therefore removed from analysis. CFA fit indices and the model-comparison test suggested that both models fit equally well. The 2 -factor model yielded a strong interfactor correlation, and 13 of 14 items fit the Rasch model. The Rasch item difficulty order was consistent with the hypothesized item difficulty order. Conclusion. The results suggest that WMFT items measure a single construct. Furthermore, the results depict an item difficulty hierarchy that may advance the theoretical discussion of the person ability versus task difficulty interaction during stroke recovery...|$|E

30|$|The largest {{study was}} by Black et al. [7], who {{performed}} secondary analyses of three large randomised controlled trials of bisphosphonates. Two trials {{were based on}} alendronate therapy: the Fracture Intervention <b>Trial</b> (<b>FIT)</b> [5] and FIT Long-Term Extension (FLEX) [47]; a third trial was based on zoledronic acid: the Health Outcomes and Reduced Incidence with Zoledronic Acid Once Yearly—Pivotal Fracture Trial (HORIZON–PFT) [20]. In the FIT trial, 6, 549 women {{over the age of}} 65  years were randomised to either receive alendronate or placebo for 3 – 4.5  years. The FLEX continued follow-up in 1, 099 of the 6, 549 women in the FIT trial over the subsequent 10  years. In the HORIZON–PFT trial, 7, 736 women were randomised to either receive zoledronate or placebo over 3  years. Between the three trials, 284 hip fractures were found, and only 12 were subtrochanteric or midshaft femoral fractures. Due to the low incidence of these insufficiency fractures, Black et al. concluded that there was no increased risk associated with prolonged bisphosphonate therapy. Despite the large numbers of patients on alendronate therapy, the authors themselves eluded to the fact that their study was underpowered for definitive conclusions. Further weaknesses include the short duration of bisphosphonate therapy in most cases. Only 1, 000 of 15, 384 patients took bisphosphonates for > 4  years. Another limitation in the process was the lack of radiographs, and therefore the inability to assess for signs of atypia. The diagnosis of insufficiency fracture was again based on fracture site as per radiological report and history of a low-energy fracture.|$|E

We evaluated the hypothesis that compliance with placebo is associated inversely with bone loss and fractures among women participating in the Fracture Intervention <b>Trial</b> (<b>FIT).</b> Compliance with placebo and alendronate was evaluated using daily medication diaries. Women were defined as having high compliance if they took 80 % or more of dispensed study medication. Change in bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed using mixed models comparing women with high versus lower compliance with placebo. Cox proportional-hazards models analyzed the association between placebo compliance and various types of fractures. Among 3169 women randomized to placebo, 82 % had high compliance. Compared with women with lower placebo compliance, bone loss at the total hip was lower in compliant placebo-treated women (− 0. 43 %/year versus − 0. 58 %/year, p =. 04). Among placebo-treated women, there were 46 hip, 110 wrist, 77 clinical vertebral, and 492 total clinical fractures. Compared with women with lower placebo compliance, women with high placebo compliance had a nonsignificant reduced risk for hip fracture [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 0. 67, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 30 – 1. 45]. This trend was not observed for other fractures. Medication compliance {{may be a}} proxy for factors that confers benefit on reducing hip fracture (but not other types of fractures) independent of the effect of the medication itself.

Methods We performed a post hoc analysis of the Fracture Intervention <b>Trial</b> (<b>FIT),</b> a randomized, controlled trial that investigated the effect of alendronate versus placebo on fracture risk in postmenopausal women. We used SPC, a statistical method used for monitoring processes for quality control, to determine if and when the intervention group benefited significantly more than the control group. SPC discriminated between the normal variations over time in the numbers of fractures in both groups and the variations that were attributable to alendronate. The TTB was defined as the time point from which the cumulative difference in the number of clinical fractures remained greater than the upper control limit on the SPC chart. Results For the total group, the TTB was defined as 11 months. For patients aged ≥ 70  years, the TTB was 8 months [absolute risk reduction (ARR)  =  1. 4  %]; for patients aged < 70  years, it was 19  months (ARR =  0. 7  %). Conclusion SPC is a clear and understandable graphical method to determine the TTB. Its main advantage is that there is no need to define a prespecified time point, as is the case in traditional survival analyses.

40|$|Background: A {{number of}} recent case reports and series have {{identified}} a subgroup of atypical fractures of the femoral shaft associated with bisphosphonate use. A population-based study did not support this association. Such a relationship has not been examined in randomized trials. Methods: We performed secondary analyses using the results of three large, randomized bisphosphonate trials: the Fracture Intervention <b>Trial</b> (<b>FIT),</b> the FIT Long-Term Extension (FLEX) trial, and the Health Outcomes and Reduce d Incidence with Zoledronic Acid Once Yearly (HORIZON) Pivotal Fracture Trial (PFT). We reviewed fracture records and radiographs (when available) from all hip and femur fractures to identify those below the lesser trochanter and above the distal metaphyseal flare (subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femur fractures) and to assess atypical features. We calculated the relative hazards for subtrochanteric and diaphyseal fractures for each study. Results: We reviewed 284 records for hip or femur fractures among 14, 195 women in these trials. A total of 12 fractures in 10 patients were classified as occurring in the subtrochanteric or diaphyseal femur, a combined rate of 2. 3 per 10, 000 patient-years. As compared with placebo, the relative hazard was 1. 03 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 06 to 16. 46) for alendronate use in the FIT trial, 1. 50 (95 % CI, 0. 25 to 9. 00) for zoledronic acid use in the HORIZON-PFT trial, and 1. 33 (95 % CI, 0. 12 to 14. 67) for continued alendronate use in the FLEX trial. Although increases in risk were not significant, confidence intervals were wide. Conclusions: The occurrence of fracture of the subtrochanteric or diaphyseal femur was very rare, even among {{women who had been}} treated with bisphosphonates for as long as 10 years.

40|$|Background: The Fracture Intervention <b>Trial</b> (<b>FIT)</b> {{demonstrated}} that the bisphosphonate alendronate {{reduces the risk of}} hip, spine and wrist fracture in osteoporotic women by approximately one half. Objective: To use data from FIT to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of alendronate. Design: A Markov model was developed for a cohort of Swedish women, comparable in relative fracture risk to the women enrolled in the FIT vertebral fracture arm (i. e. age 71 years with low bone mass plus at least one prior spine fracture). The women in the model (with low bone mass and a previous spine fracture) were exposed to alendronate therapy and transitioned over time from a `well' health state to health states of `hip fracture', `spine fracture', `wrist fracture' or `death'. All costs were calculated in 2000 Swedish kronors (SEK). Time horizon: In the Markov model our base-case treatment duration was 5 years followed by a 5 -year period where the benefit declined linearly to 0. Results: We found that treating 71 -year-old osteoporotic women with a prior spine fracture with alendronate resulted in a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of SEK 76 000, which is well below the threshold for cost effectiveness of SEK 300 000. For women aged 65 years, the cost-effectiveness ratio increased to SEK 173 000 and for women aged 77 years, the cost-effectiveness ratio decreased to SEK 52 000. Conclusions: Treating older osteoporotic women with alendronate was more cost effective than treating younger women with osteoporosis, and treating osteoporotic women with prior spine fracture was more cost effective than treating osteoporotic women without prior spine fracture. However, the costs per QALY gained for all populations studied were below generally accepted thresholds for cost effectiveness.

40|$|In the Fracture Intervention <b>Trial</b> (<b>FIT)</b> Long Term Extension (FLEX) Trial, 10 {{years of}} alendronate (ALN) did not {{significantly}} {{reduce the risk of}} nonvertebral fractures (NVFs) compared with 5 years of ALN. Continuing ALN reduced the risk of clinical but not morphometric vertebral fractures regardless of baseline vertebral fracture status. In previous studies, ALN efficacy for NVF prevention in women without prevalent vertebral fracture was limited to those with femoral neck (FN) T-scores of - 2. 5 or less. To determine whether the effect of longterm ALN on fracture differs by vertebral fracture status and femoral neck (FN) T-score, we performed a post hoc analysis using FLEX data, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial among 1099 postmenopausal women originally randomized to ALN in the FIT with mean ALN use of 5 years. In the FLEX Trial, women were randomized to placebo (40 %) or ALN 5 mg/day (30 %) or ALN 10 mg/day (30 %) for an additional 5 years. Among women without vertebral fracture at FLEX baseline (n= 720), continuation of ALN reduced NVF in women with FLEX baseline FN T-scores of - 2. 5 or less [relative risk (RR) = 0. 50, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 26 - 0. 96] but not with T-scores of greater than - 2. 5 and - 2 or less (RR 0. 79, 95 % CI 0. 37 - 1. 66) or with T-scores of greater than - 2 (RR 1. 41, 95 % CI 0. 75 - 2. 66; p for interaction =. 019). Continuing ALN for 10 years instead of stopping after 5 years reduces NVF risk in women without prevalent vertebral fracture whose FN T-scores, achieved after 5 years of ALN, are - 2. 5 or less but does not reduce risk of NVF in women whose T-scores are greater than - 2. © 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research...|$|E

40|$|In Europe, bespoke {{orthopaedic}} {{shoes are}} usually sent {{for a trial}} fitting in order to check the fit and indicate any modifications required before final finishing. The use of shell shoes at the fit assessment stage, rather than the traditional alternative of partially or fully finished shoes, can offer service advantages, and is widely used for example in the Netherlands. However the comparability of shell fit assessment with the traditional method of <b>trial</b> shoe <b>fit</b> assessment has not been evaluated, either to assess its sensitivity or to elucidate any difference in assessment technique required of the orthotist. In this work, the results of fit assessments by both methods are compared. The trial involved a group of normal subjects wearing high street shoes of styles {{similar to those used}} for orthopaedic footwear. The results indicate that the shell fit assessments were in the main comparable to those for <b>trial</b> shoe <b>fit.</b> The only consistent area of deviation noted, in the heel at the topline, is attributable to a construction factor in shoe making. Apart from this area, the orthotist need not adjust his technique {{to make use of the}} shell method...|$|R
