5|$|Fighters Uncaged is a {{fighting}} video {{game for the}} Xbox 360 Kinect system. It was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft in November 2010. Fighters Uncaged {{was one of the}} first twelve games released for the Kinect. The game has the player control Simon, a man who is attempting to win an illegal fighting tournament to help get his father out of trouble with a crime lord. It has one game mode and features many different fighting moves and different settings and opponents. Simon is able to go up in leagues by obtaining certain numbers of points, which in turn unlock more scenarios and opponents. Following its release, Zuffa filed a lawsuit against Ubisoft for the usage of a trademarked term. Fighters Uncaged received poor reviews from critics, with many criticizing the tutorial and visuals, and citing its motion control system as <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> they had with the game, which many considered to be broken.|$|E
5|$|The main {{creative}} {{force behind}} the overall 3D presentation was Kazuyuki Hashimoto, the general supervisor for these sequences. Being experienced in the new technology the team had brought on board, he accepted the post at Square as the team aligned with his own creative spirit. One of the major events in development was when the real-time graphics were synchronized to computer-generated full motion video (FMV) cutscenes for some story sequences, notably an early sequence where a real-time model of Cloud jumps onto an FMV-rendered moving train. The backgrounds were created by overlaying two 2D graphic layers and changing the motion speed of each to simulate depth perception. While {{this was not a}} new technique, the increased power of the PlayStation enabled a more elaborate version of this effect. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> with the 3D graphics was the large memory storage gap between the development hardware and the console: while the early 3D tech demo had been developed on a machine with over 400 megabytes of total memory, the PlayStation only had two megabytes of system memory and 500 kilobytes for texture memory. The team needed {{to figure out how to}} shrink the amount of data while preserving the desired effects. This was aided with reluctant help from Sony, who had hoped to keep Square's direct involvement limited to a standard API package, but they eventually relented and allowed the team direct access to the hardware specifications.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} multi-faceted {{problems}} in Occidental Mindoro's economy. In rice farming, <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> confronting the producers {{is the high}} cost of production. This is attributed mainly to the spiraling prices of farm inputs. A study concluded that from 1997 to 2003, the cost of production rose by 47 percent, while the income derived from marketing rice maintained 1997 levels. There are also confused reports that the average production rate has declined due to the reduced application of necessary farm chemicals. In street language, this means that the farmers simply cut the amount of inputs because they cannot afford the high capital requirements of following all the recommended inputs in the farming calendar.|$|E
25|$|On December 30, 1996, Chavous {{was elected}} {{chairman}} of the Council's Committee on Education, Libraries and Recreation. Ward 3 council member Kathy Patterson, a veteran education activist, also fought for the chairmanship. Patterson strongly criticized Chavous' commitment to educational reform, but Council Chairman David A. Clarke awarded the post to Chavous after he publicly declared education reform to be <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> facing the sity. Patterson, however, won an agreement that stripped jurisdiction over labor issues from Chavous' committee {{and gave it to}} the Committee on Government Operations (chaired by Patterson). During his first year in office, the District of Columbia Public Schools undertook an emergency $50 million project to repair leaking and structurally unsound roofs at several public schools. The project was significantly mismanaged, and forced a delay in the opening of the school year. Chavous ordered a hearing on the issue in September 1997, but a significant number of parents of schoolchildren complained he had not provided enough oversight and acted too late. In March 1997, Chavous sponsored another significant piece of legislation, a resolution disapproving a construction contract for the highly controversial Barney Circle Freeway.|$|E

The decision to locate most of the events and accommodation at the showgrounds reduced [...] many of the issues.

500|$|A new {{committee}} was created, the Committee on Postponed Parts, to address other questions {{that had been}} postponed. Its members, such as Madison, were delegates who had shown a greater desire for compromise and were chosen for this reason as most in the Convention wanted to finish their work and go home. The committee dealt with questions related to the taxes, war making, patents and copyrights, relations with Indian tribes, and Franklin's compromise to require money bills to originate in the House. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> they addressed was the presidency, and the final compromise was written by Madison with the committee's input. They adopted Wilson's earlier plan for choosing the president by an electoral college, and settled on the method of choosing the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, which many such as Madison thought would be [...] "nineteen times out of twenty".|$|E
500|$|Xenosaga Episode I was {{developed}} by a core team of between 60 and 80 people, expanding to over 100 people at its most active development period. Among the staff, twenty of them had previously worked on Xenogears. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> faced when building the team {{was that they were}} developing for the PlayStation 2, a console with far more power than any previous console they had worked on. A major improvement in Takahashi's view over his work on Xenogears was {{that he was able to}} make the entire game using 3D graphics, something he had been unable to do with Xenogears. Due to the amount of preparatory work and getting accustomed to the new hardware, actual development did not start until 2000, lasting approximately a year. Namco provided development support with the motion capture technology. Takahashi later noted that the sheer number of young and inexperienced developers in Monolith Soft negative impacted development, with the graphics engine being completed only six months before the game's release. Prior to its announcement, the game {{was developed}} under the working title [...] "Project X".|$|E
500|$|Square had {{announced}} that Xenogears {{may not have}} {{come out in the}} United States due to [...] "sensitive religious issues". The English translation of Xenogears was the first instance in which an English localization team worked directly with Square developers. It also was the first major project of Square translator Richard Honeywood. According to Honeywood, translating the game was a particularly difficult task due to it containing numerous scientific concepts and philosophies. He came into contact with it because its previously assigned translators quit or asked for reassignment due to its challenge. In a later interview, Honeywood stated that <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> was with the multiple religious references, and the concept at the end of [...] "killing God", which needed to be adjusted so that it remained faithful to the original premise while stepping around some content that might offend. Honeywood unintentionally had a hand in the Japanese naming of Deus: the staff were originally going to call it Yahweh, and during his argument against it he said [...] "yabeh-o", a Japanese phrase meaning something dangerous. Seeing it as a good pun, the staff used Yabeh as the name.|$|E

500|$|While the {{original}} game was first designed for Microsoft Windows personal computers (PC) before being ported to PS2, a console version of Invisible War was decided upon {{from the beginning}} of development. The team used their experience porting Deus Ex to PS2 when creating the console version. The team wanted to bring {{the original}} PC-based experience to consoles rather than making the game for consoles, so the team chose the Xbox as it had the largest memory capacity out of available consoles at the time. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> faced by the team when moving from PC to console was the smaller processing power and RAM. Due to the limited hardware of the Xbox, the environment sizes needed to be scaled down compared to the first game, but the team tried to make the smaller areas denser, with more interactive elements. When creating the game, the team rebuilt all the systems from scratch from the engine to the render and sound system. The game used a combination of the Unreal Engine and the Havok physics software. The choice of Unreal was governed by several factors including familiarity with the engine and the wish to develop for both PC and console environments; while the basic structure of the Unreal Engine was used, the team replaced the renderer, artificial intelligence (AI) programming and physics engine. Integrating Havok allowed for [...] "richer" [...] simulation of real-time physics. The AI was designed to exhibit a wider range of responses than the original game, noticing disturbances, searching environments and being able to call in reinforcements.|$|E

2500|$|Later, an instanton liquid {{model was}} studied. This model starts from the {{assumption}} that an ensemble of instantons cannot be described by a mere sum of separate instantons.

2500|$|During the campaign, <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> {{was whether}} the 12-year {{governorship}} of Itō should continue, {{or whether it was}} time for change in Mitazono.

Itō accepted the national agency's position to allow the plant to operate for up to 60 years from the date the reactors were commissioned.

In the weeks leading up to March 6, both Gingrich and Santorum experienced ballot problems. <b>The</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> was failing to appear on the Virginia primary ballot, leaving that race to Romney and Paul.

500|$|Controversy {{surrounding}} <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue,</b> <b>the</b> world's {{most widely}} circulated street newspaper, {{is a good}} example of these two schools of thought. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> is mostly a tabloid covering celebrity news; while it is sold by the homeless and generates a profit that is used to benefit the homeless, the content is not written by them and there is little coverage of social issues that are relevant to them. [...] In the late 1990s when the London-based paper began making plans to enter markets in the United States, many American street newspaper publishers reacted defensively, saying they could not compete with the production values and mainstream appeal of the professionally produced <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> or that <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> did not do enough to provide a voice to the homeless. The reaction to <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> raised what is now an ongoing conflict between commercialized, professional papers and more grassroots-style ones, with papers such as <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Issue</b> emulating mainstream papers and magazines in order to generate a large profit to invest in homeless issues and others focusing on political and social issues rather than on content that will generate money. [...] Some street newspaper proponents believe that the primary aim of the papers should be to give homeless individuals a voice and to [...] "fill the void" [...] in mainstream media coverage, whereas others believe it should be to provide homeless individuals with jobs and an income.|$|R

2500|$|Other {{researchers}} {{maintain that}} people only engage in survival sex {{when they have}} no other options. Psychologist and anti-prostitution activist Melissa Farley, writing in the New York Times, says that prostitution is nearly always coercive and lacking in full consent. She says this is <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>issue,</b> not simple inequalities between buyers and sellers, nor health and safety risks. Farley says women rarely have viable alternative means of paying for the basic needs {{of themselves and their}} loved ones. Farley argues that even having the [...] "job option" [...] is immoral because it will most likely hurt women who are very vulnerable (psychologically, economically, or otherwise). Farley says for women looking to survive, the experience can be traumatizing, and she describes it as [...] "Becoming objects for masturbation". She also warns that the men who pay for prostitution the most are usually the most violent towards women.|$|E
2500|$|Lanz {{was brought}} to trial in 1947 in the {{so-called}} [...] "Southeast Case" [...] of the Nuremberg Trials, along with other Wehrmacht generals active in the Balkans. The trial was concerned with the atrocities carried out against civilians and POWs in the area. In Lanz's case, <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>issue</b> was the Cephalonia massacre. However, his defence team was able to {{cast doubt on the}} allegations concerning these events, and as the Italians did not present any evidence against him, Lanz was able to convince the court that he had in fact resisted Hitler's directives and that the massacre did not happen. He claimed that the report to Army Group E reporting the execution of 5,000 soldiers had been a ruse employed to deceive the Army command, in order {{to hide the fact that}} he had disobeyed the Führer’s orders. He added that fewer than a dozen officers were shot and the rest of the Acqui Division was transported to Piraeus through Patras. His defence also falsely claimed that the Italians were under no orders to fight from the War Office in Brindisi, and would therefore have to be regarded as mutineers or franc-tireurs who had no right to be treated as POWs under the Geneva conventions.|$|E
