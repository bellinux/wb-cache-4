On July 4, Republican lawmakers affirmed their commitment to not agree to a budget of over $34 billion. Documents leaked after June 30 stated that the Republican leadership included anti-abortion provisions, a voter ID requirement, and a ban on stem cell research during the budget negotiations. Both the Republican legislative leaders and Dayton (along with DFL legislative leaders) toured Minnesota {{to make their case}} to Minnesotans. The government shutdown ended after Governor Dayton announced on July 14 that he would accept the last Republican offer before the shutdown, albeit with certain conditions.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, the Bears began a {{voluntary}} offseason program, {{and because they}} had a new head coach, the Bears were given a two-week earlier start than teams that did not hire a new head coach. For the first <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program, the only activities allowed were strength and conditioning and rehabilitation, and only strength and conditioning coaches are allowed to be on the field with the players. On the third week, {{a voluntary}} minicamp was held, and all coaches were permitted to work. From April 16–18, the Bears held two-hour non-contact drills, and held ten organized team activities (OTAs) during May 13 – June 6, followed by a mandatory minicamp from June 11–13.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's {{coaching}} staff drew media attention {{when it was}} announced that Virginia Tech head football coach Frank Beamer was being actively recruited by Clemson to assume that school's vacant head coaching job. Beamer was first contacted about the job during the regular season, and he was mentioned in connection with Clemson's search throughout the final <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regular season. He also was mentioned as a possibility for South Carolina's vacant head-coaching job. Three days after Virginia Tech was selected for the Music City Bowl, Beamer ended speculation by publicly turning down Clemson and South Carolina. In exchange for publicly rebuffing the offers, Virginia Tech rewarded Beamer with financial additions to his contract and a contract extension through 2005.|$|E

QPR manager Gerry Francis {{wanted to make the}} signing a permanent one, but the club were unable to afford the £800,000 fee Spurs had asked for. After returning to Spurs he again punched someone in the face, this time a supporter who had shouted abuse to Walsh on the pitch after a game against Norwich City. He ended the campaign with three goals in 22 starts and 15 substitute appearances.|$|E

5|$|Plasmapheresis and {{intravenous}} immunoglobulins (IVIG) are the {{two main}} immunotherapy treatments for GBS. Plasmapheresis attempts to reduce the body's attack on the nervous system by filtering antibodies out of the bloodstream. Similarly, administration of IVIG neutralizes harmful antibodies and inflammation. These two treatments are equally effective, but {{a combination of the}} two is not significantly better than either alone. Plasmapheresis speeds recovery when used within four weeks of the onset of symptoms. IVIG works as well as plasmapheresis when started within <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> onset of symptoms, and has fewer complications. IVIG is usually used first because of its ease of administration and safety. Its use is not without risk; occasionally it causes liver inflammation, or in rare cases, kidney failure. Glucocorticoids alone have not been found to be effective in speeding recovery and could potentially delay recovery.|$|E
5|$|Shelters {{closed by}} September1 and {{residents}} {{returned to their}} homes, although Hatteras Island remained off-limits to everyone but emergency workers for several days. Unemployment across Hatteras rose {{in the wake of}} the damage to local businesses, and many restaurants lost product when their refrigerators failed during the power outages. Residents piled debris from their damaged homes on roads, primarily Highway 12, and workers responded by clearing the debris. The highway was speedily reopened and repaired at a cost of around $1million. Within <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> storm, businesses resumed as cleaning work was under way, and the island was reopened to tourists. Clean-up operations in the region lasted weeks to months. In the three months after the storm, saltwater intrusion into the Cape Hatteras water supply boosted chlorine levels from 40milligrams (0.0014ounces) to 280milligrams (0.01ounces) per liter; it took another three months for the chlorine to decrease to normal concentrations. Around 50homeowners affected by Emily raised their houses to prevent a recurrence, partially funded by flood insurance payments.|$|E
5|$|A month {{into the}} 2008–09 season, Luongo began a shutout streak that lasted three {{games against the}} Nashville Predators, Phoenix Coyotes, and the Minnesota Wild, akin to the feat he {{accomplished}} in the same month of November the previous year. His overall shutout streak was snapped at 242:36 minutes, in a 2–1 shootout loss against the Colorado Avalanche, surpassing the Canucks record he set the previous season. Later that month, on November 22, Luongo left a game versus the Pittsburgh Penguins after suffering an adductor strain in his groin. Initially listed as week-to-week, he attempted what was considered an early comeback within <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> injury, but suffered a setback during a team practice on December 10, leaving early in discomfort. After missing 24 games, Luongo made his return on January 15, 2009, in a 4–1 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes. While injured, Luongo was chosen {{for the fourth time}} to the NHL All-Star Game in 2009 as the lone Canucks representative. Despite speculation he would have to miss his second straight All-Star Game, Luongo recovered in time and took part in a 12–11 shootout loss to the Eastern Conference. He finished the season with back-to-back shutouts in the final two games against the Los Angeles Kings and Colorado Avalanche to establish a new career-high of nine shutouts on the season, breaking Dan Cloutier's previous franchise single-season shutout record of seven, set in 2001–02.|$|E

5|$|During the war Hirst, {{along with}} Rhodes and their team-mate Schofield Haigh, {{worked in a}} munitions factory in Huddersfield. Hirst and Rhodes were paid by Yorkshire to play in war-time cricket matches on {{a certain number of}} Saturdays. Hirst played in the Bradford League, and became known among cricketers for {{accepting}} minimal fees from financially struggling clubs. When first-class cricket restarted in 1919, Hirst resumed playing for Yorkshire. In the first match of the season he hit an aggressive unbeaten 180 against MCC, to secure a draw for the county; he followed this with two more centuries in the first <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season. Although his form later faltered, he played some substantial innings in difficult circumstances and ended the season with 1,441 runs at an average of 38.94. He bowled infrequently, taking 18 wickets at 29.27. During this season, Hirst accepted the position of coach at Eton College. In the last match of the season, at Scarborough, he was given a warm reception by the crowd, who did not expect to see him playing for Yorkshire again. However, he appeared on occasions during the school holidays in the next two seasons, although he did not score any centuries, did not average more than 24 with the bat and took only 21 wickets in total. At the end of the 1921 season Hirst retired as a Yorkshire player, and made what was expected to be his final first-class appearance in a Scarborough Festival match, in which he captained the Players against the Gentlemen. On {{the last day of the}} match, Hirst's 50th birthday, he took the final two wickets to secure victory for his side. The crowd gathered outside the pavilion and demanded to see him; he gave a farewell speech, and was moved by the reception given to him.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the eastern}} portion of West Virginia was {{declared}} a federal disaster area on November 7, 1985. Within <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> declaration, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) began clearing debris across the state, which was completed by July 1986. Widespread areas were under a boil-water advisory due to damage to water facilities, prompting officials to deliver trucks with bottled water through disaster areas. The state's highway department worked with FEMA and the USACE to clear destroyed buildings. Workers also buried killed animals, cleared blocked streams, and helped farmers regrow lost crops. FEMA opened 20disaster centers across the state to coordinate residents' requests for federal aid, and used 290 full or part-time employees. Overall federal assistance totaled $285million, including $171million for debris removal and repairing infrastructure, $90million for loans and temporary housing, and $24million through payments from the National Flood Insurance Program. This followed a six-week period when applications for such assistance were processed. After receiving complaints about inadequate funding, FEMA increased payments to 869people. FEMA also built 647temporary mobile homes, {{only about half of}} which were utilized. Residents complained that the money spent on the homes was misdirected and instead should have been given directly to victims. Many residents in Albright moved away after the main industry - river rafting - was washed away. In the city of Parsons, most businesses relied on small business loans to continue operating, although 18stores never reopened following the floods. Officials held a telethon on state television and radio on December7, 1985, that ultimately raised $1.7million for storm victims in the state. In the years after the flood, residents rebuilt houses farther away from flood plains, while officials rebuilt roads, bridges, and public buildings.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Hornets saw {{combat in}} several roles during the Iraq War. Following the {{outbreak}} of war on 20 March, No.75 Squadron was initially used to escort high-value Coalition aircraft, such as tankers and airborne early warning and control aircraft. As it rapidly {{became clear that the}} Iraqi Air Force posed no threat, from 21 March No.75 Squadron also began to also conduct air interdiction sorties against Iraqi forces. These sorties were initially flown in support of the United States Army's V Corps, but the squadron was rarely assigned any targets to attack. As a result, the Australian commanders in the Middle East had No.75 Squadron reassigned to support the United States Marine Corps' I Marine Expeditionary Force. At this time the squadron also began flying close air support sorties. During the first <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war the squadron typically flew 12 sorties per day. To avoid pilot fatigue, additional aircrew were posted to the Middle East from Australia. The number of sorties dropped to between six and ten per day from 5 April onwards as the American forces closed on Baghdad and few targets remained in southern Iraq. On 12 April, No.75 Squadron supported elements of the Special Air Service Regiment and 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, which occupied Al Asad Airbase. During the last weeks of the war the squadron continued to fly sorties across western, central and southern Iraq to support British and American forces. In several of the squadron's operations in the final week of the war, the Hornets made low altitude and high speed passes over Iraqi positions to encourage their defenders to surrender. No.75 Squadron conducted its final combat sorties on 27 April. During the war the squadron flew 350 combat missions (including 670 individual sorties) and dropped 122 laser-guided bombs. No.75 Squadron did not suffer any casualties, and all 14 Hornets returned to Tindal on 14 May 2003.|$|E
