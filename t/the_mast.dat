5|$|A crew {{of three}} sailed from Little River (Horry County, South Carolina) {{en route to}} Rhode Island. The {{hurricane}} destroyed <b>the</b> <b>mast,</b> leaving the crew stranded over the open ocean in shark-infested waters. After 12days, the United States Coast Guard rescued the three.|$|E

5|$|The storm {{increases}} in force, breaking <b>the</b> <b>mast,</b> tearing the sails and flooding the hold. All four manage to survive by lashing {{themselves to the}} hull. As the storm abates, they find themselves safe for the moment, but without provisions. Over the following days, the men face death by starvation and thirst.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a couple}} of ways to put a small model ship inside of a bottle. The {{simplest}} way is to rig <b>the</b> <b>masts</b> of <b>the</b> ship and raise it up when the ship is inside <b>the</b> bottle. <b>Masts,</b> spars, and sails are built separately and then attached to the hull of the ship with strings and hinges so <b>the</b> <b>masts</b> can lie flat against the deck. The ship is then placed inside the bottle and <b>the</b> <b>masts</b> are pulled up using the strings attached to <b>the</b> <b>masts.</b> <b>The</b> hull of the ship must still be able to fit through the opening. Bottles with minor distortions and soft tints are often chosen to hide the small details of the ship such as hinges on <b>the</b> <b>masts.</b>|$|R

50|$|In the {{neighbourhood}} of <b>the</b> <b>masts,</b> in <b>the</b> 1970s a 110-metre-tall mast radiator was built. Today, the basements of <b>the</b> <b>masts</b> and <b>the</b> guy anchors remain there.|$|R
5|$|A {{dedicated}} two-way {{bicycle path}} {{exists on the}} northern side of the roadway between Santo Road and Mast Boulevard, with access possible from both terminii. East of <b>the</b> <b>Mast</b> Boulevard interchange, SR52 crosses and begins to parallel the San Diego River. The freeway enters the city of Santee, where SR52 was built alongside Mission Gorge Road. SR52 intersects {{the northern end of}} SR125, where SR52 traffic can exit south onto SR125. The freeway continues east through Santee, with interchanges at Fanita Drive, Cuyamaca Street, and Magnolia Avenue, before it comes to an end at SR67.|$|E
5|$|German {{astronomer}} Johann Bode {{defined the}} constellation Lochium Funis, the Log and Line—a nautical device once used for measuring speed and distance travelled at sea—around Pyxis in his 1801 star atlas, but the depiction did not survive. In 1844 John Herschel attempted to resurrect the classical configuration of Argo Navis by renaming it Malus <b>the</b> <b>Mast,</b> a suggestion followed by Francis Baily, but Benjamin Gould restored Lacaille's nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|Norrington escapes {{with the}} heart amid a battle with Jones's crew, and Jones summons the Kraken. Realizing Sparrow is the target, Elizabeth traps him aboard the Black Pearl as the crew {{abandons}} the ship, and kisses him while she handcuffs him to <b>the</b> <b>mast.</b> Then, the monster devours Sparrow and drags the ship and his soul to Davy Jones's Locker. The surviving crew seeks refuge with Tia Dalma who produces a captain she says can rescue Sparrow: it was her doing that brought Barbossa back to life.|$|E
50|$|The bridge {{features}} two A-Frame <b>masts,</b> which support <b>the</b> {{bridge from}} the west bank. <b>The</b> <b>masts</b> are positioned on a shared foundation and anchored at ground level by two 4+3/4 in diameter cables that are connected the tips of <b>the</b> <b>masts.</b> <b>The</b> forward <b>mast</b> is 262 ft long and <b>the</b> back <b>mast</b> is 226 ft long. Because of the angle at which <b>the</b> <b>masts</b> are positioned, <b>the</b> bridge stands at 229 ft above ground. The deck is 16 ft wide and 13+1/2 ft above water at high tide. The bridge has a clear span of 476 ft.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> tallest <b>mast</b> {{radiator}} {{ever built}} was <b>the</b> Warsaw radio <b>mast</b> at Konstantynow, Poland. The antenna was 648.38 m high but collapsed in 1991. Currently <b>the</b> <b>masts</b> of <b>the</b> Lualualei VLF transmitter, at 458.11 m, are <b>the</b> tallest <b>mast</b> radiators insulated against ground. In contrast to <b>the</b> Warsaw Radio <b>Mast,</b> <b>the</b> Lualualei antenna uses extensive electrical lengthening measures. <b>The</b> tallest <b>mast</b> radiator not using electrical lengthening {{may be the}} Hellissandur longwave radio mast at 411.48 m high.|$|R

5|$|On November 12, 2013, the Height Committee of the Chicago-based Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) {{made the}} {{controversial}} announcement that One World Trade Center was the tallest {{building in the}} United States at 1,776 feet, declaring that <b>the</b> <b>mast</b> {{on top of the}} building is a spire since it is a permanent part of the building's architecture. By the same reasoning, the building was also the tallest in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat of}} the U-boats in May 1943 did not signal {{the end of the}} Battle of the Atlantic. Some 60 vessels remained, and posed a threat to convoys. In later months, the Schnorchel, a device {{originated}} by the Dutch and later adopted by the Kriegsmarine after the Germans invaded the Netherlands were capable of allowing a U-boat to replace its air supply and vent its diesel exhaust without surfacing became available. However, it was sensitive to the weather, and put immense pressure and strain on crews who had to remain submerged for long period in hostile waters. Further, Coastal's Mark III radar could detect <b>the</b> <b>mast.</b> The smoke emitted was visible from 1,000 feet. In some cases <b>the</b> <b>mast</b> itself could be seen, some one foot in diameter, projecting two feet and moving at 12–15 knots. The technological response was to use High Tea, a series of sonobuoys dropped by aircraft onto the surface of the sea to detect U-boats. By late 1943, the U-bootwaffe was losing 20 percent of its strength per month. Some 70 percent that did return were seriously damaged.|$|E
5|$|The flag of Pakistan symbolizes Pakistan's {{commitment}} to Islam and equal rights of religious minorities where the larger portion (3:2 ratio) of flag is dark green representing Muslim majority (98% of total population) while a white vertical bar (3:1 ratio) at <b>the</b> <b>mast</b> representing {{equal rights for}} religious minorities and minority religions in country. The crescent and star symbolizes progress and bright future respectively.|$|E
50|$|At this point, even a hard-driving clipper {{captain had}} to {{acknowledge}} that his exciting new vessel was somewhat oversparred. Land had three feet cut off <b>the</b> <b>masts.</b> <b>The</b> decision to reduce the height of <b>the</b> <b>masts</b> seemed to work out well, without negative impact on performance.|$|R

50|$|The {{antenna system}} {{consists}} of thirteen masts, each 227 m tall, which {{are arranged in}} two rings around <b>the</b> central <b>mast.</b> <b>The</b> VLF antenna consists of four rhombic antennas hung on large insulators on <b>the</b> <b>masts,</b> which are all grounded.|$|R
5|$|The flag {{should be}} flown at half-mast {{as a sign}} of mourning. The {{decision}} to do so lies with the President of India, who also decides the period of such mourning. When the flag is to be flown at half mast, it must first be raised to the top of <b>the</b> <b>mast</b> and then slowly lowered. Only the Indian flag is flown half mast; all other flags remain at normal height.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear affects sailboats {{in motion}} by {{presenting}} a different wind speed and direction at different heights along <b>the</b> <b>mast.</b> The effect of low level wind shear can be factored into {{the selection of}} sail twist in the sail design, but this {{can be difficult to}} predict since wind shear may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for low level wind shear, for example using a boom vang.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 29 March 1945, Kommandøren was docked at the remains of Søndre Nykirkekai in Bergen. At around 01:00 the ship was struck by one of two torpedoes accidentally fired by a German torpedo boat {{anchored}} {{on the opposite side}} of Vågen bay. The torpedo explosion threw debris from Kommandøren over a wide area, and left the ship lying on the harbour bed. Only <b>the</b> <b>mast</b> and a section of the bow remained above water. The midship and aft sections of the ship were completely destroyed by the torpedo. The only crew member on board at the time, Able Seaman Alf Larsen, was killed in the incident.|$|E

5|$|Elphinstone rapidly took {{advantage}} of the confusion Harriers attack had created, passing Aalbers' bow and raking his ship. Elphinstone then threw his sails back, halting his ship and allowing Greyhound to maintain a position across Pallas bow from which he could inflict severe damage on the Dutch frigate without coming under fire himself. As the damage and casualties mounted on Pallas, Harrier joined the attack. Gunfire from the Dutch ship gradually slackened, and finally stopped at 06:10, the Dutch flag was struck from <b>the</b> <b>mast</b> and Pallas surrendered with over 40 casualties from a crew of 250 (including 50 local recruits). Throughout the engagement, Victoria and Batavier had kept up a constant but inefficient fire on Harrier, Troubridge waiting until the Dutch flagship surrendered before counterattacking.|$|E
5|$|For {{mourning}} activities, {{the flag}} can be flown {{in either of}} the following ways. The first method, commonly known as half-staffing, is performed when the flag is hoisted {{to the top of}} the flagpole, then lowered to the pole's one-third position. The other method is to attach a black ribbon to a flag that is permanently affixed to a staff. The ribbon itself is ten centimetres wide and it is attached to <b>the</b> <b>mast</b> so that the ends of the ribbon reach the bottom of the flag. During a funeral ceremony, the flag may be used to cover the coffins of government officials, soldiers, signatories of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, and persons designated by an act of the President; these flags are later folded and presented to the next of kin before interment.|$|E
5|$|Jack {{orders the}} {{survivors}} to abandon ship, but Elizabeth, realizing the Kraken only wants Jack, tricks him and chains him to <b>the</b> <b>mast</b> {{so that the}} crew can escape. The Kraken drags Jack and the Pearl to Davy Jones' Locker. Jones opens the chest to discover the heart is gone. In Port Royal, Norrington gives Beckett {{the heart and the}} Letters of Marque meant for Jack, allowing him back into the navy as well as allowing Beckett to gain control of Davy Jones and the seas. The Pearls crew take shelter with Tia Dalma, where they all agree to rescue Jack. Tia Dalma introduces the captain that will guide them: the resurrected Captain Barbossa.|$|E

5|$|Now {{under the}} command of Hill, and {{accompanied}} by two German prisoners acting as interpreters, the Australians proceeded down the road under a flag of truce and persuaded the garrisons of two more trenches to surrender, but not before another skirmish in which the Germans counter-attacked, wounding three more Australians, one fatally. During the firefight one of the unarmed German interpreters was killed by the Australians, as were several of the Melanesians. The advance continued and another group of defenders was encountered and disarmed by nightfall. By 19:00the Australians reached the radio station which was found abandoned; <b>the</b> <b>mast</b> had been dismantled, although the instruments and machinery remained intact. The surviving defenders had abandoned the defences and withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|The Manor of Deptford or West Greenwich was {{bestowed}} by William the Conqueror upon Gilbert de Magminot or Maminot, {{bishop of}} Lisieux, {{one of the}} eight barons associated with John de Fiennes for the defence of Dover Castle. Maminot held the head of his barony at Deptford and according to John Lyon writing in 1814, he built himself a castle, or castellated mansion at Deptford, of which all traces had by then long since been buried in their ruins, but from the remains of some ancient foundations which had been discovered the site was probably on the brow of Broomfield, near <b>the</b> <b>Mast</b> Dock and adjacent to Sayes Court.|$|E
5|$|With the Orca slowly sinking, {{the trio}} attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on scuba gear {{and enters the}} water in a shark-proof cage, {{intending}} to lethally inject the shark with strychnine using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly, killing Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody stuffs a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing <b>the</b> <b>mast,</b> shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, destroying it. The resulting explosion kills the shark. Hooper resurfaces, and he and Brody paddle to Amity Island clinging to boat wreckage.|$|E
