Males, {{on the other}} hand, favor using the glands on their neck, muzzle, and chest, by embracing horizontal and vertical surfaces and rubbing themselves over them. Both sexes will occasionally scent mark in ways characteristic of the opposite sex.|$|E
5|$|Another legend narrated {{is linked}} to the six Khmer bronze statues (three lions–with heads {{substituted}} later in Burmese style, a three-headed elephant known as Airavata, and two warriors in the form of Shiva), which are installed in the temple in the northern end of the courtyard.

5|$|Both {{the males}} and females become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year-and-a-half old. However, males {{actually}} mate after the age of four to five years. Males and females are most reproductive till the age of 14 and 14–18 years, respectively, with the maximum age of successful lactation in females being 13–14 years. With no fixed breeding season; births may occur at any time of the year. A study at Dvůr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic) showed that 55% of the births occurred between September and December. A rutting male tests the urine of any female he encounters, to which the female responds by urinating. Having located a female in estrus, the male follows her closely, trying <b>to</b> <b>rub</b> his cheek on her rump, head, neck, and chest. He performs gasping movements with his lips. Finally, the male mounts the female, resting his head and neck on her back, in a similar way as other tragelaphines.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2008, the Steelers {{played the}} Jacksonville Jaguars at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. At {{that point of}} their season, the Jaguars were 2-2-0, and feeling very hopeful for the season {{following}} a defeat at home of their division rival Indianapolis Colts. The game was very close going into the second half, and the Steelers were still stinging from a Mathis interception and runback for a touchdown. Shortly {{after the start of}} the third quarter, Jaguars mascot Jaxson de Ville stood alongside some cheerleaders, and produced a Terrible Towel, which he used <b>to</b> <b>rub</b> his armpits and buttocks. Shortly after that, the Steelers ran away with the game and the Jaguars lost 26-21. The Jaguars went on to lose eight of their remaining eleven games in the season.|$|E
5|$|The skull was {{structured}} {{in such a}} way that as it closed, the bones holding the teeth in the upper jaw would bow out. This would cause the lower surfaces of the upper jaw teeth <b>to</b> <b>rub</b> against the upper surface of the lower jaw's teeth, grinding anything caught in between and providing an action that is the rough equivalent of mammalian chewing. Because the teeth were always replaced, the animal could have used this mechanism throughout its life, and could eat tough plant material. Additionally, the front ends of the animal's jaws were toothless and tipped with bony nodes, both upper and lower, providing a rough margin that was likely covered and lengthened by a keratinous material to form a cropping beak for biting off twigs and shoots. Its food gathering would have been aided by its flexible little finger, which could have been used to manipulate objects, unlike the other fingers.|$|E

5|$|When resting, lion {{socialisation}} occurs {{through a}} number of behaviours, and the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking, which have been compared with grooming in primates. Head rubbing – nuzzling one's forehead, face and neck against another lion – appears to be a form of greeting, as it is seen often after an animal has been apart from others, or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend <b>to</b> <b>rub</b> other males, while cubs and females rub females. Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked, which may have arisen out of utility, as a lion cannot lick these areas individually.|$|E
5|$|During the fall, elk grow a thicker coat of hair, {{which helps}} to {{insulate}} {{them during the}} winter. Males, females and calves of Siberian and North American elk all grow thin neck manes; female and young Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis do not. By early summer, the heavy winter coat has been shed, and elk are known <b>to</b> <b>rub</b> against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies. All elk have small and clearly defined rump patches with short tails. They have different coloration based on the seasons and types of habitats, with gray or lighter coloration prevalent {{in the winter and}} a more reddish, darker coat in the summer. Subspecies living in arid climates tend to have lighter colored coats than do those living in forests. Most have lighter yellow-brown to orange-brown coats in contrast to dark brown hair on the head, neck, and legs during the summer. Forest-adapted Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis have darker reddish-brown coats with less contrast between the body coat {{and the rest of the}} body during the summer months. Calves are born spotted, as is common with many deer species, and they lose their spots by the end of summer. Adult Manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older. This characteristic has also been observed in the forest-adapted European red deer.|$|E
5|$|Patching was one {{of several}} backstrokers who had slipped on the {{starting}} area earlier in the meet, so Kerry decided <b>to</b> <b>rub</b> a sticky red substance onto the soles of his feet. The Soviet organisers had provided a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best. He finished his leg in 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place. Kuznetsov gave the Soviets the lead after posting a time of 56.81s, with Hungary and Great Britain in second and third place. France was the last to reach the 100m mark, recording a time of 58.84s. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, the fastest split among the breaststrokers by 0.63s. His leg moved Australia into second place at the halfway mark, just 0.45s behind the hosts and roughly half a second ahead of the British and the Hungarians. The four leading teams had broken away, leaving a two-second gap back to the fifth-placed East Germans.|$|E

30|$|Fabrics {{are often}} rubbed against other surfaces, and color change during the {{abrasion}} process should be minimized. In the present study, the color fastness <b>to</b> <b>rubbing</b> {{of the samples}} GS- 04 and GS- 06 was tested. The dry rubbing color fastness of the gold NP-treated silk fabrics was rated as 5 for both GS- 04 and GS- 06. And the rating of the wet color fastness of the fabrics with gold NPs was assessed to be 5. The staining of the cotton cloths was assessed to be 4 – 5 for both GS- 04 and GS- 06 under wet and dry conditions. The results demonstrate that the silk fabrics colored with gold NPs exhibited good color fastness <b>to</b> <b>rubbing</b> (dry or wet).|$|R
5|$|As Patching {{had slipped}} {{earlier in the}} meet, Kerry decided <b>to</b> <b>rub</b> a sticky red {{substance}} onto {{the soles of his}} feet. The Soviet hosts had installed a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, drawing Australia almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than he had done over the distance. Tonelli did so with an uneven arm technique due to the uneven strength in his arms. He began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the end of his leg. Brooks then executed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. He had drawn level by the halfway mark and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his teammates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. The team then made a celebratory dive into the pool and were interviewed poolside. In 2000, Kerry and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.|$|E
