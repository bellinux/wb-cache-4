In desperation, many of <b>these</b> <b>poor</b> laborers migrated east, seeking their own land near the rain forest. In 1968, the World Health Organization found that polluted water led to 17% of all Nicaraguan deaths.|$|E
25|$|There is less robust {{evidence}} of good outcomes {{for patients with}} borderline personality disorder, with some studies showing only small to moderate effect sizes. The authors comment that <b>these</b> <b>poor</b> outcomes might reflect a need for additional support for some patients, {{in addition to the}} group therapy. This is borne out by the impressive results obtained using mentalization-based treatment, a model that combines dynamic group psychotherapy with individual psychotherapy and case management.|$|E
25|$|In 1647 Mirza Raja Jai Singh {{joined in}} Shah Jahan's {{invasion}} of Balkh and Badakshan in Central Asia. The conquest was easily {{achieved by the}} Mughals but the occupation of <b>these</b> <b>poor</b> regions could not be sustained—not one Mughal officer would agree to be posted permanently in that desolate land {{and away from the}} wealth and luxury of India, which was ironic since many of them had originated from these parts! This insane project thus ended in financial failure.|$|E

The money that we spend on an evening’s entertainment might instead save some poor person from death, blindness, or chronic and severe pain. If we believe that, in our treatment of <b>these</b> <b>poorest</b> people, we are not acting wrongly, we are like those who believed that they were justified in having slaves. Some of us ask how much of our wealth we rich people ought to give to <b>these</b> <b>poorest</b> people. But that question wrongly assumes that our wealth is ours to give. This wealth is legally ours. But <b>these</b> <b>poorest</b> people have much stronger moral claims to some of this wealth. We ought to transfer to these people (...) at least ten per cent of what we earn." ...|$|R

On their way to Berlin, the Brazilian swim team made this stopover to train with the French national team, and to adapt to the new time zone.|$|E
25|$|Skinnand was {{a village}} of just 12 people in 1801, {{according}} to the Census returns. The population did rise slightly over the next 100 years, to 30 in 1901, but by 1921 numbers were once again decreasing and the figure stood at 25. Census returns also reveal {{that most of the}} village men worked on the land as unskilled labourers. The children of <b>these</b> <b>poor</b> labourers attended school at Wellingore, just south of Navenby, and at Carlton-le-Moorland and Bassingham - each village several miles walk away.|$|E

The old Inquisition had its rack and its {{thumbscrews}} and its instruments of torture with iron teeth. We know what these things are today; the iron teeth are our necessities, the thumbscrews are the high-powered and swift machinery close to which we must work, and the rack is here in the firetrap structures that will destroy us the minute they catch on fire.|$|E

50|$|Some of <b>these</b> <b>poorer</b> merchants became {{successful}} {{enough to}} compete with chartered merchants for city administration positions, but many supported themselves by making and selling low cost goods, such as umbrellas and straw sandals, for mass consumption. This signifies that the commoner population of Kanazawa began to generate its own consumption demands, thus stimulating even more growth. Suddenly, samurai aside, merchants and artisans were needed to support the townspeople alone. Some even began selling explicitly to the chōnin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{quality of}} Lorenz rifles during the Civil War was not consistent. Some were {{considered}} to be of the finest quality, and were sometimes praised as being superior to the Enfield. Others, especially those in later purchases, were described as horrible in both design and condition. The bored out versions were not consistent in caliber, ranging from [...]57 to [...]59. Many of <b>these</b> <b>poorer</b> quality weapons were swapped out on the battlefield for Enfield rifle-muskets whenever one became available.|$|R
25|$|In 1935, as anti-Semitism {{was growing}} in Germany, Vishniac was {{commissioned}} by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) in Central Europe to photograph Jewish communities in Eastern Europe {{as part of a}} fund-raising drive to help support <b>these</b> <b>poor</b> communities. Vishniac developed and printed these pictures in his dark room in his Berlin apartment. Further trips to Eastern Europe were undertaken between 1935 and 1938, again {{at the behest of the}} JDC. Vishniac used both a Leica and a Rolleiflex camera in his photography. In 1939, his wife and children moved to Sweden to stay with Luta's parents, away from hostile Germany. He met his parents in Nice that summer.|$|E
25|$|Regarding health care, Ron Paul {{said that}} “managed care isn’t working” and that “drug {{companies}} lobby for managed care”. Paul said, “We {{could take care}} of <b>these</b> <b>poor</b> people if we weren’t trying to maintain an empire overseas”. Ron Paul hit continued to discuss the issue of military non-interventionism, “70% of Americans want war over with and {{are sick and tired of}} big government at home and overseas”. They want their “civil liberties and not allow government to spend endlessly and bankrupt us”. Paul also answered questions related to his experience with Medicaid and endorsed allowing civil unions for same-sex couples country-wide, with marriage itself handled solely by religious institutions.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrary}} to economic reasons described by India and Pakistan, common fishermen {{of both countries}} get trapped in conflict and their economic rights of earning get affected. It has seen that government of India and Pakistan regularly arrest fishermen of each other for crossing the boundary, however for a common fisherman, {{it is always a}} wonder to know where the boundary starts and ends in sea. This unawareness are added with wind flow, waves and turbulence that push the boat in sea. While UN law advocates for minimum penalty for this offence and release of boats, but government of India and Pakistan catch these prisoners and keep them in prisons for long time. It is more unfortunate that their release happens through land boundary of India and Pakistan (Wagha border) and <b>these</b> <b>poor</b> fishermen come to their home country without their boats.|$|E

50|$|In a book {{published}} by the United Nations University Press on sustainable development of Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) basins, several authors present their scientific studies on floods and the environment and social impact of flood control and other infrastructure projects in GBM basins. Shah claims the GBM region supports about 10% of the world population, even though it represents just 0.12% of the world's total geographical area. The GBM basin, which includes the state of Uttar Pradesh, contains the largest concentration of the poorest in the world. GBM basin is prone to floods, which causes recurring flood damage, affecting <b>these</b> <b>poorest.</b>|$|R
25|$|Following his wife's death, {{he began}} discerning a {{vocation}} {{to join a}} monastery, perhaps in France. One day, while discussing his vocation with the sister of Thomas Hussey, the Bishop of Waterford, a band of ragged boys passed by. She pointed to them, and cried:"What! Would you bury yourself in a cell on the continent rather than devote your wealth and your life to the spiritual and material interest of <b>these</b> <b>poor</b> youths?"After settling his business affairs in 1802, Rice {{devoted his life to}} prayer and charitable work, particularly with the poor and marginalised of Waterford. In 1802, when he established a makeshift school in a converted stable in New Street, Waterford, he found the children were so difficult to manage that the teachers resigned. This prompted him to sell his thriving business to another prominent Roman Catholic merchant, a Mr. Quan, and devote himself to training teachers who would dedicate their lives to prayers and to teaching the children free of charge. Despite the difficulties involved, Edmund's classes were so popular that another temporary school had to be set up on another of his properties, this time in nearby Stephen Street.|$|E
500|$|Gleeson further {{distinguished}} himself {{later that}} year by assisting in the defence of a trench against enemy attack. [...] He had {{a strong commitment to}} the idea of freeing Belgium from German occupation but was known to be critical of what he considered anti-clerical views held by the French authorities. [...] Gleeson was familiar with the realities of war and, in December 1914, wrote that [...] "if ... advocates of war were made to be soaked and caked and crusted with cold, wet trench mud, like <b>these</b> <b>poor</b> soldiers, and to wear those mud-weighted coats they would not be so glib with their treatises on the art of war. These militants should be made undergo a few nights in cheerless billets [...] mud-river trenches to teach them a lesson. What is it all for at all?".|$|E
500|$|The year 1902 saw {{a steady}} stream of {{high-quality}} Dooley pieces written by Dunne, with the barkeeper philosopher commenting on the events of the day, including King Edward's coronation, Arthur Conan Doyle's tales of Sherlock Holmes, and Arctic exploration. But most were on American politics. That Dunne was often a guest of Roosevelt at the White House did not spare the president from being skewered by Dooley, nor was the former Rough Rider's aggressive foreign policy spared. Dunne disliked imperialism, and was outraged by the actions of U.S. forces in the Philippine insurrection against American rule; he satirized Governor William Howard Taft's glowing report on progress there, [...] "We are giving hundreds of <b>these</b> <b>poor</b> benighted heathen the well-known old-fashioned American water cure... Everywhere, happiness, content, love of the step-mother country, except in places where there are people." ...|$|E
5000|$|McPhee {{notes that}} one of the central {{challenges}} to addressing sex tourism is the differing laws and norms regarding normal sexual behavior in sending and receiving countries. Because sex tourism is a transnational issue, it must be addressed beyond the domestic level. Sex tourism also has economic implications for all nations involved. [...] Sex tourism is encouraged by the tourist sector of destination countries, because it draws individuals from wealthier nations with greater amounts of disposable income into poorer nations. This stimulates the economy of <b>these</b> <b>poorer</b> nations. <b>These</b> economic reinforcements are part of the reason sex tourism continues to exist.|$|R

500|$|Acne usually {{improves}} {{around the}} age of 20, but may persist into adulthood. Permanent physical scarring may occur. There is good {{evidence to support the}} idea that acne and associated scarring negatively impact a person's psychological state, worsen mood, lower self-esteem, and are associated with a higher risk of anxiety disorders, depression, and suicidal thoughts. Another psychological complication of acne vulgaris is acne excoriée, which occurs when a person persistently picks and scratches pimples, irrespective of the severity of their acne. This can lead to significant scarring, changes in the affected person's skin pigmentation, and a cyclic worsening of the affected person's anxiety about their appearance. [...] Rare complications from acne or its treatment include the formation of pyogenic granulomas, osteoma cutis, and solid facial edema. [...] Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to reduce the chances of <b>these</b> <b>poor</b> outcomes.|$|E
500|$|Gleeson was an {{advisor to}} men {{of all faiths}} in the {{regiment}} and kept careful records of their names and addresses {{so that he could}} write to the families of those that died. He ended each letter with the words [...] "They paid a great sacrifice", which was later used as the title of a book published in 2010 that details the wartime service records of men from Cork. [...] Much of his time was spent answering letters from families in Ireland concerned about the wellbeing of their sons and husbands. [...] At times the task almost overwhelmed him and this is evident in his personal diary when he wrote, in June 1915, [...] "I got 12 letters today; just after reading them. What answering they will take tomorrow. I like to give <b>these</b> <b>poor</b> people all the solace I can, anyhow, but still there’s no limit to the sorrowing inquiries. The tragedy of these letters".|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} and enduring success of Cold Comfort Farm dominated {{the rest of}} Gibbons's career. Neville thought that after so singular a success {{at the start of}} her career, the rest was [...] something of an anticlimax, despite her considerable [...] industry and undoubted skills. [...] The 1985 edition of The Oxford Companion to English Literature [...] defines Gibbons solely in terms of Cold Comfort Farm; it mentions none of her other works—while providing her bêtes noires Morgan and Mary Webb with full entries. To Gibbons, Cold Comfort Farm became [...] "That Book" [...] or [...] "You-Know-What", its title never mentioned. Despite her growing irritation and expressed distaste for it, the book continued to be lauded by successive generations of critics, Boston described it as [...] "one of those rare books of comic genius that imprints itself on the brain and can never afterwards be eradicated". A more negative view of the book has been expressed by the literary critic Mary Beard, who considers it [...] "a rather controlling victory of modern order, cleanliness, contraception and medicine [...] over these messy, different, rural types... I found myself screaming for the rights of <b>these</b> <b>poor</b> country folk NOT to {{fall into the hands of}} people like Flora".|$|E

30|$|Localisation of {{temperature}} estimates was attempted through simple adiabatic adjustments of NIWA’s data and also adjustments that use elevation above sea level, latitude and {{distance from the}} sea. The latter adjustment {{was found to be}} slightly better than simple adiabatic adjustment. Results showed that useable local estimates can be obtained from absolute global solar radiation and adjusted mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures although there were small amounts of bias. Rainfall and relative humidity were not as well estimated for local points as the other variables and <b>these</b> <b>poorer</b> estimates may constrain our ability to model forest productivity in drier regions of New Zealand.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a differentiated products model of school competition that distinguishes among different dimensions that {{matter in the}} skill acquisition process. The model predicts that when identical schools compete for students, specialization may arise as a competition strategy. This serves rich students' education goals well. Poorer students, however, may attend schools with specializations that do not cater to their relative strengths. By doing so, <b>these</b> <b>poorer</b> students complement the weaknesses of the richer students through peer effects and receive financial aid in return. The empirical analysis provides {{strong support for the}} model's predictions about within-school implications of specialization.

500|$|The song's title phrase {{originated}} from Bono asking his brother how his struggling business was going, and the brother responding, [...] "It's like running to stand still." [...] Bono {{had not heard}} the phrase before, and he thought it expressed what heroin addiction {{and the effects of}} the drug on the body were like; a writer later described the title as a [...] "perfect distillation of the dynamic of feeding on addiction." [...] Bono had heard a real story about a pair of heroin addicts, a man and a woman, who lived in the Ballymun towers. [...] Out of money and unable to pay the rent due to their habit, the man became a heroin smuggler, operating between Dublin and Amsterdam and taking enormous risks for a big payday. Bono felt the man was decent at heart but was constrained by his squalid living conditions, as well as poor choices, and Bono wanted to illustrate how <b>these</b> <b>poor</b> conditions affected their lives. [...] The resulting lyric does not describe any of this explicitly, but instead [...] the emotional atmosphere that the couple live in. [...] In doing so, the song is not judgmental and shows sympathy for the woman. [...] A character monologue from Wim Wenders' 1984 film Paris, Texas, was also a significant influence on Bono's writing of the song.|$|E
500|$|The {{spoliation}} of Bavaria led to entreaties {{from the}} Elector's wife, Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska, {{for him to}} divest himself of the French alliance. Although the Elector wavered somewhat in his allegiance to Louis XIV, his resolve to continue fighting against Leopold I and the Grand Alliance was stiffened when news arrived that Tallard's reinforcements– some 35,000 men– would soon be in Bavaria. Marlborough now intensified the policy of devastating the Elector's territory. On 16 July the Duke wrote to his friend Heinsius, the Grand Pensionary of Holland, [...] "We are advancing {{into the heart of}} Bavaria to destroy the country and oblige the Elector {{one way or the other}} to a compliance". The policy compelled the Elector to send 8,000 troops from Augsburg to defend his own property, reserving only a fraction of his army to join the French under Marsin and Tallard. But although Marlborough thought it a necessary strategy to secure success, it was of doubtful morality. The Duke himself confessed his reservations to his wife, Sarah, [...] "This is so uneasy to my nature that nothing but an absolute necessity would have obliged me to consent to it. For <b>these</b> <b>poor</b> people suffer only for their master's ambition." [...] Accounts differ as to the actual amounts of damage done. De La Colonie thought that reports of the devastation were perhaps exaggerated for propaganda purposes; yet Christian Davies serving with Hay's Dragoons wrote, [...] "The allies sent parties on every hand to ravage the country... We spared nothing, killing, burning or otherwise destroying whatever we could not carry off." [...] To Historian David Chandler, Marlborough must bear the full responsibility for the destruction, for although he undoubtedly found it hard to stomach it was taken under Baden's, and the Emperor's protests.|$|E

There are some observations of attacks on Fuscous honeyeater but the two species tend to avoid each other where occurring sympatrically.
