40|$|This study {{examines}} tour guide performance {{and its relationship}} with tourist satisfaction {{in the context of}} package tours in Shanghai. A multilayer framework of tourist satisfaction in the package tour context is proposed. Tourist satisfaction was conceptualized to include three aspects/layers: satisfaction with <b>guiding</b> <b>service,</b> satisfaction with tour services, and satisfaction with the overall tour experience. Tour guide performance was found to have a significant direct effect on <b>tourist</b> satisfaction with <b>guiding</b> <b>service</b> and an indirect effect on satisfaction with tour services and with tour experience. Satisfaction with <b>guiding</b> <b>service</b> positively affected satisfaction with tour services but showed no direct effect on satisfaction with the overall tour experience. However, indirect effect of satisfaction with <b>guiding</b> <b>service</b> on satisfaction with tour experience mediated by satisfaction with tour services was significant.

To implement such a dynamic service-based applications, in this paper, we propose a framework for personal <b>tourist</b> <b>guide</b> (PTG) system based on service oriented architecture (SOA). In our proposed framework, PTG send a request based on the context of user to a catalogue.

At the last step, tourist may utilize the provided services. To evaluate this framework, a simple case study was developed.

However, despite the prominent role that <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> play in the system of tourism, fairly scant scientific {{attention has been paid}} to them to date. <b>Tourist</b> <b>Guides</b> create a link between the visitor and the host country. Yet, of the small amount of literature devoted to them, very few studies have asked <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> their views and opinions, and have built up a profile of the <b>tourist</b> <b>guide.</b> This paper is an attempt to redress the balance.

However, of {{the small amount of}} literature published, very few studies have asked <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> their views and opinions, or have built up a profile of the <b>tourist</b> <b>guide.</b> This paper attempts to redress the balance. This study, concentrating on professional <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> in Dublin, Ireland. Potential threats and challenges {{to the future of the}} industry are explored, particularly threats from unqualified guides and from the introduction of information technology (IT). Primary research was carried out with the <b>Tourist</b> <b>Guides</b> of Dublin, Ireland as this destination contains the largest number of <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> on the island of Ireland. The employers of <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> were asked their opinions on issues related to <b>tourist</b> <b>guiding</b> in a series of in-depth interviews. Many of the conditions of the role characterised universally in the existing literature as negative, suit Dublin <b>tourist</b> <b>guides.</b> They like the challenge; the seasonality; and the freelance and part-time nature of the job. Key issues to emerge from the study include the demand from <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> to have their industry licensed and regulated, and that the practice of driving-guiding is outlawed. A key recommendation for the sustainability of the profession is to establish a system of on-going training and assessment for guides to ensure that high standards of performance by professional <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> are maintained. The findings of this research make a significant contribution to the knowledge in the field of <b>tourist</b> <b>guiding,</b> as well as making a number of unique contributions to the understanding of that industry in Ireland.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the Continuing Tourism Related Education (CTRE) in career as <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> in Malaysia. CTRE training is given to <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> as a compulsory requirement to renew the guiding license and as part of their professional developments. Most of the previous research emphasised on the training for <b>tourist</b> <b>guides,</b> however this research focuses on the effectiveness of CTRE itself on <b>tourist</b> <b>guides.</b> In order to discover the effectiveness of this enhancement course, this research is done by applying a quantitative research. This study has outlined three important research questions. Firstly, do a <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> understand the knowledge obtained from CTRE course and secondly, do the <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> practice the knowledge and experience from CTRE course when performing their duties. Lastly, the research question deals on how CTRE course could be effective to <b>tourist</b> <b>guides.</b> The results of this study illustrate the effectiveness of this course to <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> based on their experience attending the CTRE throughout their period of <b>service</b> as licensed <b>tourist</b> <b>guides.</b> The findings indicate that <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> have understood the knowledge gained from CTRE in terms of product/tourist attraction/destination history and the concept and challenges in tour <b>guiding.</b> Furthermore, <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> also practice the knowledge and experience gained from CTRE into their everyday guiding tasks with fresh knowledge, good communication skills, self-confidence and others.

40|$|Not only is tourism {{becoming}} {{one of the fastest growing}} industries of both the developed and developing countries, it is also the point of entry into a country and its culture. The movement of people between countries and the burgeoning size of the tourism industry has created the need for the professionalisation of <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> within countries. Furthermore, there has also developed a need for implementing <b>tourist</b> <b>guiding</b> legislation to better regulate the tourism sector. The <b>tourist</b> <b>guide</b> has become one of the key industry players, because he or she is usually the first point of contact between the tourist and the country. As such, this study will focus on the development and implementation of <b>tourist</b> <b>guiding</b> legislation in three destinations: South Africa, Canada and Australia. It will compare the different regulatory measures each country has implemented and also look at the relationship between the <b>tourist</b> <b>guide</b> and government, as well as the relationship of the <b>tourist</b> <b>guide</b> and the <b>tourist.</b> The importance of the <b>tourist</b> <b>guide</b> as mediator or interpreter will also be focused on. Lastly the concept of cross-border tourism will also be considered, this is because people usually visit more than one country when they go on holiday and <b>tourist</b> <b>guides</b> will often have to operate between the two countries and take part in cross-border tourism. In short, this study will be a comparative one primarily concerned with <b>tourist</b> <b>guiding</b> legislation within South Africa, Canada and Australia. It will consider the place of the <b>tourist</b> <b>guide</b> within the historical and practical context. Dissertation (MHSC) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.
