25|$|Horseshoes {{have long}} been {{considered}} lucky. They were originally made of iron, a material which was believed to ward off evil spirits, and traditionally were held in place with seven nails, seven being the luckiest number. The superstition acquired a further Christian twist due to a legend surrounding the 10th century saint Dunstan, {{who worked as a}} blacksmith before becoming Archbishop of Canterbury. The legend recounts that, one day, the Devil walked into Dunstan's shop and asked him to shoe his horse. Dunstan pretended not to recognize him, and agreed to the request; but rather than nailing the shoe to the horse's hoof, he nailed it to the Devil's own foot, causing him great pain. Dunstan eventually agreed <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe,</b> but only after extracting a promise that the Devil would never enter a household with a horseshoe nailed to the door.|$|E

5000|$|To {{improve the}} {{performance}} of the quill pedal toe clips were added. The toe clip is a thin metal or plastic attachment to the front cage of the pedal. The toe clip is shaped like the toe of a shoe and its function is to prevent a cyclist's shoe from slipping off the pedal during the forward pedaling motion. A further enhancement of the quill pedal was modifying the toe clip to allow a strap and buckle to go around or through both the pedal and the toe clip to encircle the cyclist's foot {{on the top of the}} pedal. This strap is generally made of leather or nylon.To further improve the quill pedal's efficiency a [...] "cleat" [...] was developed. This cleat consists of a small metal or plastic attachment to the cyclist's shoe. The cleat is slotted and is adapted to engage a quill section of the bicycle pedal. The use of the slotted cleat enhances a cyclist's ability over that provided by toe clips and strap, enabling for greater pedaling efficiency. Although quill pedals can be used with smoothed-soled cycling shoes or ordinary shoes, they were designed to be used with cycling shoes which had a slotted shoeplate attached to its sole. The disadvantage with this system is that <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> from the pedal a rider had to reach down and loosen the strap by hand or leave the toe strap loose and thus give up some efficiency. This type of pedal and pedal setup was common for racing cyclists until the mid to late 1980s.|$|E

40|$|The goal on this {{investigation}} {{was to develop a}} detachable high heel shoe construction that could enter the current high heel market. The impact of high heel shoes on women's fashion is enormous but there are associated issues of comfort and health with these shoes. This work aims to maintain the appealing aspects of a high heel shoe while adding a concealed mechanism to enable the heel <b>to</b> be easily <b>removed</b> <b>to</b> convert <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> into a flat at the discretion of the user. The current solutions and products in the nearly 7 billion dollar a year women's shoe market are minimal. The prior arts of detachable heels fail to develop a simple comprehensive detachable high heel that can enter the market. A feasible and complete design that takes into account arch stiffness, heel removal, styling, and manufacturability is the goal of this work. This investigation deconstructed high heel shoes to learn and leverage the current high heel shoe infrastructure as a basis for adapting <b>the</b> <b>shoe</b> into a detachable high heel shoe construction. Three prototypes of the detachable high heel shoe were developed with a shoe assembly that consisted of a modified insole and a detachable heel that consisted of a dovetailed aluminum shank fastened to a high heel. (cont.) The prototypes were able to display the ability for the detachable high heel to maintain high heel stability, styling that is consistent with the industry, ease of use, a flat shoe and other critical functional requirements identified in the work. The construction was consistent with the current industry high heel infrastructure. The development of the detachable high heel construction displays the feasibility of such a product in a market where none exist. The detachable high heel construction needs further refinement and optimization to complete a design that is ready to enter this exciting market. by Alfredo Louis Morales. Thesis (S. B.)
