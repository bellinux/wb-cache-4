The biological significance of an increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia is questionable, because of a lack of statistical significance in the amosite group when evaluated using life table analysis, lack of significance when compared to the tremolite control group, and the fact that no toxic or neoplastic lesions were observed in the target organs, i. e., gastrointestinal tract and mesothelium.

No evidence was found that Occupational exposure to man-made mineral fibres led to any ferruginous body formation. Asbestos body counts appeared to differentiate between mesothelioma cases and controls and between levels of radiological asbestosis, but in both comparisons, based on small numbers, the power of discrimination was low.

40|$|Asbestos is {{a generic}} name given to six fibrous {{minerals}} (chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, anthophyllite, <b>tremolite</b> and actinolite <b>asbestos),</b> {{widely used in}} commercial products. Asbestos fibers are characterized by high tensile strength, flexibility, resistance to chemical attack and thermal degradation, large surface area and ability to be woven. These properties made the asbestos {{one of the most}} important material for cement, thermal insulation, sound proofing and anti-fire products. It has been produced also for use in textiles, gaskets, ropes, laminates with resins. The fibrous nature of asbestos minerals is dangerous: the light and thin fibers can spread in air and be respired, causing cancer, due to their chemical and physical properties. The use of asbestos fibers in coupling with complex materials make difficult its recognition. In airborne analysis, asbestos fibers can be confused with organic fibers such as cotton and wool. The aim of this work is to characterize asbestos fibers using image analysis as in previous work (Inoue et al., 1999), it is carried out in four steps: (i) image acquisition from airborne fibers samples; (ii) fibers identification by image segmentation; (iii) fibers analysis and features extraction, by dimension, shape, color and texture measurements; (iv) fibers classification...|$|R
40|$|The {{differences}} between chrysotile asbestos, a serpentine mineral, and amphibole asbestos have been debated extensively.

40|$|Non-occupational, {{environmental}} and unintentional exposure to fibrous tremolite, {{one of the}} most widespread naturally occurring asbestos, represents a potentially significant geological risk in several parts of the world. The toxicity of amphibole asbestos is commonly related to iron content and oxidation state, but information available on surface iron topochemistry and amphibole alteration mechanism is still rather poor. With the aim to shed a light on this mechanism, two tremolite samples, one from Italy (Castelluccio) and one from USA (Maryland), immersed in a buffer solution (pH 7. 4) with H 2 O 2 were characterized by a multi-technique approach. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) were used to investigate the surface chemistry of the incubated samples and to detect structural modifications of the fibres, while inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to determine the concentration of dissolved elements. An original four-step model for amphibole alteration pathway is proposed. The alteration process starts with an incongruent dissolution of the amphiboles that produces an amorphous, altered surface layer and that is followed by iron oxidation and formation of FeOOH species. Then the congruent dissolution of the altered layer starts and, subsequently, the residual Fe oxi-hydroxides aggregates and insoluble, Fe-rich, amorphous nanoparticles on top of the fibres are formed. The results are compared to those obtained on crocidolite, a highly toxic amphibole asbestos with a 10 to 20 times higher iron content than tremolite. The high chemical reactivity observed in the literature for tremolite appears to be related not only to its iron content and oxidation state, but also to the low nuclearity of iron on the altered surfaces, in contrast to pronounced Fe clusterization at crocidolite surfaces. This is a significant step toward a conceivable explanation of why <b>asbestos</b> <b>tremolite</b> is potentially as toxic as crocidolite...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Deposits of {{carbonate}} rock like limestone and dolomite {{may contain}} <b>tremolite</b> <b>asbestos.</b> This study assessed {{the exposure to}} <b>tremolite</b> <b>asbestos</b> and the respiratory health of Swedish dolomite workers.  METHODS— 95 % of 137  eligible workers at two dolomite producing companies completed a self administered questionnaire that included questions on respiratory symptoms and were examined with spirometry as well as chest radiography. Total exposure to dust was gravimetrically measured and the <b>tremolite</b> <b>asbestos</b> content of the dust was assessed with polarisation and phase contrast microscopy.  RESULTS—Dolomite dust concentrations were moderate (median 2. 8  mg/m 3) and <b>tremolite</b> <b>asbestos</b> concentrations were generally below the limit of detection (< 0. 03 fibres/ml). Somewhat higher values, around 0. 1  fibres/ml, were obtained in manual stone sorting and bagging. Respiratory symptoms suggestive of chronic bronchitis were more related to smoking than to estimates of individual exposure to dust. The mean vital capacity was 0. 2  l lower than expected after adjustment for sex, age, height, and smoking but the decline in lung function {{was not associated with}} current or cumulative exposure to dust in a clear cut way. Two definite cases of pleural plaques and one possible case of simple pneumoconiosis were noted, but the plaques could not be attributed exclusively to exposure to <b>tremolite</b> <b>asbestos.</b>  CONCLUSIONS—Dolomite mining and milling may indeed entail low levels of exposure to <b>tremolite</b> <b>asbestos,</b> but this exposure was not a strong determinant of respiratory symptoms, lung function, or pneumoconiosis in exposed Swedish workers. This was true also for dolomite dust. The hazards of exposure to <b>tremolite</b> <b>asbestos</b> may vary across deposits, however, and additional studies at other sites of carbonate rock exploitation are warranted.    Keywords: asbestos tremolite; dolomite; lung functio...|$|E
