Humans have the ability <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> behaviours to determine if their actions are moral. In situations of trauma, humans can choose to self-forgive by allowing themselves to change and live a moral life. Self-forgiveness may be required in situations where the individual hurt themselves or in situations where they hurt others.|$|E
25|$|On one level, {{the show}} is a {{conventional}} family drama, dealing with such issues as interpersonal relationships, infidelity, and religion. At the same time, {{the show is}} distinguished by its unblinking focus {{on the topic of}} death, which it explores on multiple levels (personal, religious, and philosophical). Each episode begins with a death – the cause of which ranges from heart attack or murder to sudden infant death syndrome – and that death usually sets the thematic tone for each episode, allowing the characters <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> current fortunes and misfortunes {{in a way that is}} illuminated by the death and its aftermath. The show also utilises dark humor and surrealism running throughout.|$|E

The authors introduced how an e-learning system has supported teachers engaged in a secondary education action research project <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> how <b>their</b> collaborative efforts have impacted student motivation and autonomy.

25|$|The temple {{ceremony}} involves {{entering into}} solemn covenants. Critics {{have expressed concern}} that a person may be denied access to the specific details of these covenants until that person is faced with making them in the temple, making it impossible <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> meaning or ramifications. The LDS Church does offer a temple preparation seminar and freely publishes both the student booklet, Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple, and the teacher's manual, Endowed from on High: Temple Preparation Seminar, on its website. These books and the seminar which may be held {{are designed to help}} prepare members for the temple; attendance at the seminar is often required before a bishop will issue a temple recommend {{for the first time to}} a member. In the seminar, it is taught that all of the covenants entered into during the endowment have a basis in Latter-day Saint scripture; however, the specifics of the covenants are not revealed.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{it is very}} difficult, and {{at times}} arguably impossible, to adopt {{the point of view}} of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know {{everything}} about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with what they know about the situation. However, if this approach is naïvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.|$|E
25|$|Others such as Francis Collins, Kenneth R. Miller, George Coyne and Francisco J. Ayala {{argue for}} {{compatibility}} {{since they do}} not agree that science is incompatible with religion and vice versa. They argue that science provides many opportunities to look for and find God in nature and <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> beliefs. According to Kenneth Miller, he disagrees with Jerry Coyne's assessment and argues that since significant portions of scientists are religious {{and the proportion of}} Americans believing in evolution is much higher, it implies that both are indeed compatible. Elsewhere, Miller has argued that when scientists make claims on science and theism or atheism, they are not arguing scientifically at all and are stepping beyond the scope of science into discourses of meaning and purpose. What he finds particularly odd and unjustified is in how atheists often come to invoke scientific authority on their non-scientific philosophical conclusions like there being no point or no meaning to the universe as the only viable option when the scientific method and science never have had any way of addressing questions of meaning or God in the first place. Furthermore, he notes that since evolution made the brain and since the brain can handle both religion and science, there is no natural incompatibility between the concepts at the biological level.|$|E

2500|$|Obregón {{also sought}} to shape public {{perceptions}} of the Revolution and its place in history by staging elaborate celebrations in 1921 on the centenary of Mexico's independence from Spain. [...] There had been such celebrations in 1910 by the Díaz regime, commemorating {{the start of the}} insurgency by Miguel Hidalgo. The political fact of independence was achieved by former royalist officer Agustín de Iturbide, who was more celebrated by conservatives in post-independence Mexico than liberals. However, 1921 provided a date for Obregon's government to shape historical memory of independence and the Revolution. After a decade of violence during the Revolution, the centennial celebrations provided an opportunity for Mexicans <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> history and identity, as well as to enjoy diversions in peacetime. For Obregón, the centennial was a way to emphasize that revolutionary initiatives had historical roots and that like independence, the Revolution presented new opportunities for Mexicans. Obregón [...] "intended to use the occasion to shore-up popular support for the government, and, by extension, the revolution itself." [...] Unlike the centennial celebrations in 1910, the one of 1921 had no monumental architecture to inaugurate.|$|E

2500|$|An ordained {{minister}} {{is called to}} the [...] "office of public ministry" [...] of [...] "Word and sacrament" [...] and considered a [...] "steward of the mysteries" [...] of the Church (i.e., the means of grace). Pastors primarily serve congregations, but this role has been expanded to include other forms of ministry as well (e.g., hospital and military chaplains). Pastors are ordinarily trained at one of eight ELCA seminaries located throughout the United States, although there are alternative paths for ordination to serve particular communities {{in which it is}} difficult to provide trained leaders or to allow rostering of clergy transferred from other denominations. Pastors generally hold a Bachelor of Arts degree or its equivalent, as well as a four-year master of divinity degree, are required to learn biblical Hebrew and Greek, spent at least a summer doing clinical pastoral education—an intensive program that gives them time <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> pastoral craft, usually in a hospital setting, and are required to complete a one-year internship of full-time service in pastoral ministry. A bishop is a pastor called to serve either a synod or as presiding bishop of the ELCA. The Agreement with the Episcopal Church is that bishops be ordained in the Apostolic Succession and remain in that office after retiremen (Called to Common Ministry 2000) whereas before a man or woman servee in that office and returned to being known simply as a pastor when service as a bishop ends.|$|E
2500|$|After other interventions, for {{and against}} the OdG, Mussolini spoke again, and told the {{participants}} <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> decision, since the approval of Grandi's OdG would imply the end of Fascism. He also cautioned against the illusion that the Anglo-Americans would be content with that, whereas what they really wanted {{was the end of}} Italy, which under his rule had become too strong. For him, he said, this was not about his own person: at sixty, he could have ended that “beautiful adventure” that his life had been so far. But he was sure that the war could be won: in fact, he had a [...] "key" [...] to accomplish that, but he could not disclose it. He was not willing to let his throat be cut by the King. If, on the other hand, the King would re-confirm his trust in him, the consequences for the supporters of Grandi’s OdG would be dire. At the end of his speech many of the gerarchi were visibly shaken. Grandi, jumping again from his chair, screamed that the Duce with his last words was blackmailing all of them; but, he added, if one must choose between fidelity to him and loyalty to the homeland, the choice was clear. At this point Mussolini gave the word to Scorza, who caught everyone by surprise by presenting his own OdG. This envisaged the nomination of the three war and interior ministers, all under Mussolini, and the concentration of {{power in the hands of}} the Fascist Party.|$|E
