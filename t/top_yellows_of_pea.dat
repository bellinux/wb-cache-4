40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to show the {{relationship}} between the <b>yellow</b> pigments <b>of</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum L.) seeds and climatic conditions, and to identify effective selection methods for improving seed colour quality. Three dry pea cultivars with different <b>yellow</b> hues <b>of</b> seeds and leaves and their progenies were grown in non-irrigated field experiments. A colour scale from 1 to 9 was created to measure seed colour. Drought during seed development caused a significant decrease in the xanthophyll content <b>of</b> <b>pea</b> seeds. Based on heritability estimates, the potential for selection for increased xanthophyll content in seeds (h 2 = 0. 78) was greater than for carotene (h 2 = 0. 32). The “yellow index,” defined as the ratio of carotene and xanthophylls, expressed the intensity <b>of</b> <b>yellow</b> colour <b>of</b> the seeds. The weak relation between seed colour values and yellow index (R 2 = 0. 445) should allow simultaneous selection for seeds with deep-yellow colour and higher carotene content...|$|R

Its purpose was to evaluate the antagonistic ability of the fungi Trichoderma spp. to F. oxysporum. Isolation of F. oxysporum was made from diseased tissue; Trichoderma strains were obtained from the rhizosphere of healthy plants (collected in the towns of Potosi, Córdoba, Gualmatán, Ipiales and Puerres in the state of Nariño, Colombia), and a commercial strain from laboratory Perkins Ltda. In laboratory, unrestrictedly randomized design with 21 treatments (strains) was used. Mycelial growth and inhibition zone were evaluated in dual plantings, which served as selection criteria for greenhouse test where plant height, root length, root dry matter and percentage of incidence were evaluated. In the field, a randomized block design was used to evaluate yield components, plant height and root length with the best strains. In the laboratory, C 2 (Córdoba 2), C 7 (Gualmatán 3), C 14 (Puerres 2), C 20 (Potosi 4) and C 21 (Perkins Lab.) showed antagonistic activity in the greenhouse, C 7, C 14 and C 21 were the best; in field, significant differences between C 14 and C 21, compared to C 7 and the control, were obtained.

Twelve genotypes <b>of</b> <b>pea</b> were used (Asgrow, Jumbo, Lincoln, Merveille de Kelvedon, Purser, Rajai Torpe, Snajor Kosep, Korai,Wando, Rondo, local genotype, Major Kosep Korai and Surgevil). They were cultivated on peat during 5. 5 months (from October to April). Some agronomical parameters were studied: resistance to diseases, (Powdery-mildew, mildew, <b>top</b> <b>yellow</b> virus, anthracnose, browning), fresh matter, number of branches/plant, number of flowers/plant, number of pods/ plant and the yield of grains /plant. Results showed {{that only the}} genotype Purser is resistant to all diseases and Surgevil is sensitive only to the <b>Top</b> <b>Yellow</b> virus. The local genotype is sensitive to three frequent diseases (Powdery-mildew, mildew and Anthracnose). With regard to vegetative growth, the highest yield of fresh matter do not contribute towards a high fertility rate. In fact, only the genotypes having a weak yield of fresh matter (Snajor Kosep Korai, Asgrow, Major Kosep Korai, Rajai Torpe and Purser) have the most important rate of fertility (> 30 %).

40|$|Lessons {{from nature}} call for supramolecular n/p-heterojunctions with {{oriented}} multicolored antiparallel redox gradients (OMARG-SHJs) as “ideal” photosystems. Their design combines advantages of bilayer and bulk n/p-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells for the directional separation of photogenerated charges before recombination can occur.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the suitability of a new variety <b>of</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum L., var.

Two-hundred twenty-five I S A Vedette dwarf broiler breeder pullets were fed either a corn-soy (CS) or corn-pea (CP) diet from day of age to 46 weeks of age. Diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous and isocaloric and were supplemented with D,L-methionine. Treatment groups were reared in adjacent floor pens from day of age to 22 WOA. Following selection based upon uniformity of body weight, Thirty-two pullets from each dietary treatment were placed in individual cages and photostimulated. With the initiation of lay, the following variables were measured: hen-day egg production, egg weight, fertility and hatchability of fertilized eggs. Body weight gain was controlled by restricted feeding, as had been done prior to initiation of lay. No differences were observed (p>. 05) in the reproductive parameters measured. Mortality was negligible in either treatment group.

In general, heat-moisture treatment of blends reduced pasting viscosities, swelling and degree of syneresis as compared to respective native starch blends. Compared to <b>pea</b> starch, combinations <b>of</b> <b>pea</b> starch and galactomannans (guar gum and locust bean gum) exhibited increased viscosities during pasting, whereas combinations <b>of</b> <b>pea</b> starch and anionic hydrocolloids (xanthan gum and carboxymethylcellulose) exhibited increased viscosities at lower inclusion rates only.

40|$|Many {{transcription}} {{factors are}} controlled through SUMO modification, {{and in the}} majority of cases this modification results in enhancements in their repressive properties. In some instances, SUMO modification and its associated repressive activities can be reversed by the action of intracellular signaling pathways, leading to enhanced transcriptional capacities of transcription factors. Here we have investigated sumoylation of the ETS domain transcription factor PEA 3 and its interplay with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway. PEA 3 is modified by SUMO in vitro and in vivo on multiple sites in its N-terminal region. Activation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway promotes sumoylation <b>of</b> <b>PEA</b> 3. Importantly, sumoylation <b>of</b> <b>PEA</b> 3 is required for maximal activation of target gene promoters, including MMP- 1 and COX- 2. Molecularly, sumoylation is selectively required for synergistic activation of target gene expression with the coactivator CBP. Moreover, sumoylation <b>of</b> <b>PEA</b> 3 is required for ubiquitination <b>of</b> <b>PEA</b> 3 and promotes its degradation, suggesting that SUMO-mediated recycling <b>of</b> <b>PEA</b> 3 plays a role in PEA 3 -mediated promoter activation. Thus, in contrast to the majority of other transcription factors studied, sumoylation <b>of</b> <b>PEA</b> 3 plays a positive role in PEA 3 -mediated transcriptional activation and the ERK MAP kinase pathway cooperates with rather than antagonizes this process...|$|R
