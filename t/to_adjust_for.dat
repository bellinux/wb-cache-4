5|$|Contrary to {{the flat}} {{appearance}} of the loudspeaker, all three panels are slightly curved along the vertical axis to improve quality. The panels themselves are flat, but obtain their curvature by being slightly bent to a curved backing. With the bipolar nature of the speaker emitting sound from both front and back surfaces as it does, {{the application of a}} felt sheet {{to the rear of the}} panels damps and absorbs high frequencies radiating from the back. A crossover network, set at 500Hz, remains necessary <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> back-to-front interference causing loss in output at low frequencies. In addition, the speaker should stand in free space to achieve optimum sound. The instructions book contains advice against placement of the speaker in corners or positions close to or parallel with walls, and further explains that a corner placement will adversely affect bass response and be detrimental to the midrange because of standing waves generated.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{the minimum}} wage promulgated by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

25|$|<b>To</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> a large {{sampling}} fraction, the fpc {{factored into}} {{the calculation of}} the margin of error, which {{has the effect of}} narrowing the margin of error. It holds that the fpc approaches zero as the sample size (n) approaches the population size (N), which has the effect of eliminating the margin of error entirely. This makes intuitive sense because when N = n, the sample becomes a census and sampling error becomes moot.|$|E

In survey sampling, weights {{can be applied to}} the data <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> the sample design, particularly stratified sampling. Results from probability theory and statistical theory are employed to guide the practice. In business and medical research, sampling is widely used for gathering information about a population. Acceptance sampling is used to determine if a production lot of material meets the governing specifications.|$|E
25|$|The {{rotation}} of the beam inside the cavity alters the polarization state of the beam. To compensate for this, a single pass delay line is also needed, made of either a three or two mirrors in a 3d respective 2d retro-reflection configuration {{on top of a}} linear stage. <b>To</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> beam divergence a second car on the linear stage with two lenses can be used.

25|$|Statistical {{methods such as}} {{regression}} analysis are common. Practitioners use such methods to estimate the size, economic significance, and statistical significance ("signal strength") of the hypothesized relation(s) and <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> noise from other variables. By such means, a hypothesis may gain acceptance, although in a probabilistic, rather than certain, sense. Acceptance is dependent upon the falsifiable hypothesis surviving tests. Use of commonly accepted methods need not produce a final conclusion or even a consensus on a particular question, given different tests, data sets, and prior beliefs.|$|E

25|$|Ophthalmoplegia or the {{inability}} or difficulty {{to move the}} eye is usually symmetrical. As such, double vision is sometimes a complaint of these patients. The progressive ophthalmoplegia is often unnoticed till decreased ocular motility limits peripheral vision. Often someone else will point out the ocular disturbance to the patient. Patients will move their heads <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> the loss of peripheral vision caused by inability to abduct or adduct the eye. All directions of gaze are affected; however, downward gaze appears to be best spared. This {{is in contrast to}} progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), which typically affects vertical gaze and spares horizontal gaze.|$|E
25|$|CPEO is a slowly {{progressing}} disease. It {{may begin}} {{at any age}} and progresses {{over a period of}} 5â€“15 years. The first presenting symptom of ptosis is often unnoticed by the patient until the lids droop to the point of producing a visual field defect. Often, patients will tilt the head backwards <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> the slowly progressing ptosis of the lids. In addition, as the ptosis becomes complete, the patients will use the frontalis (forehead) muscle to help elevate the lids. The ptosis is typically bilateral, but may be unilateral for a period of months to years before the fellow lid becomes involved.|$|E
25|$|The Thai Chulasakarat {{calendar}} uses {{a slightly}} different method to place the intercalary day. Instead {{of it in a}} leap year as in the Burmese system, the Thai system places it in a separate year. Thus, the Thai small leap year has 355 days while the Thai great leap year has 384 days. Both systems arrive at the same number of days in a 19-year cycle however. Furthermore, in contrast to Indian calendars, the Burmese calendar follows a Metonic cycle in which intercalary months are inserted on a set schedule. However, because the Burmese calendar has <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> the use of Indian-calendar-derived sidereal years with the Metonic cycle's tropical years, maintaining a set Metonic cycle has been a challenge.|$|E

25|$|Fidget spinners are toys {{not unlike}} yo-yo or other skill toys, {{designed}} to spin with little effort. A basic fidget spinner {{consists of a}} two- or three-pronged design with a bearing in its center circular pad. A person holds the center pad while the toy spins. They are made from various materials including brass, stainless steel, titanium, copper, aluminium, and plastic. The bearings are generally ceramic, metal (stainless steel or chrome), and some are hybridssuch as ceramic balls with stainless races and cages. Each fidget spinner also has two or more weights on the outside that make it spin faster and stay balanced. Bearings can vary <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> the design's spin time, vibration, and noise, causing unique sensory feedback.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the college}} ranks or other states, the regions and districts are not {{permanently}} set, but are redrawn biennially by the UIL {{behind closed doors}} {{in an attempt to}} keep schools of similar sizes within a certain distance of their geographic area when attending competitions, and <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> the changing enrollments of schools (moving schools with increased attendance up in classification and those with decreased attendance down) and new schools opening. The main redrawing of regions and districts takes place on February 1 of even-numbered years (and the final allocation, especially relating to high school football, is the subject of much pre-announcement anticipation and speculation as to which schools move up or down and the final composition of the districts), but as new schools open or smaller schools close or disband programs, interim adjustments can be made.|$|E
500|$|Paine begins The Age of Reason {{by attacking}} revelation. Revelation, he maintains, {{can only be}} {{verified}} by the individual receivers of the message and is therefore weak evidence for God's existence. Paine rejects prophecies and miracles, writing: [...] "it is revelation to the first person only, and hearsay to every other, and consequently they are not obliged to believe it". He {{also points out that}} the Christian revelations appear to have altered over time <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>for</b> changing political circumstances. Urging his readers to employ reason rather than to rely on revelation, Paine argues that the only reliable, unchanging and universal evidence of God's existence is the natural world. [...] "The Bible of the Deist", he contends, should not be a human invention such as the Bible, but rather a divine inventionâ€”it should be [...] "creation". Paine takes this argument even further, maintaining that the same rules of logic and standards of evidence that govern the analysis of secular texts should be applied to the Bible. In Part II of The Age of Reason, he will do just this, pointing out numerous contradictions in the Bible. For example Thomas Paine notes, [...] " [...] The most extraordinary of all the things called miracles, related in the New Testament, is that of the devil flying away with Jesus Christ, and carrying him {{to the top of a}} high mountain, and to the top of the highest pinnacle of the temple, and showing him and promising to him all the kingdoms of the World. How happened it that he did not discover America, or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any interest? [...] " ...|$|E
