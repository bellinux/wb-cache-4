25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} you or defend you, {{we have to}} say that we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E

500|$|The {{second season}} also {{received}} positive reviews, particularly the episodes following the winter finale when Quantico {{switched to a}} single timeline and began focusing on character development. Kelsey McKinney of New York magazine noted that the show had finally found its groove, writing [...] "For {{the first time since}} its first season, Quantico actually seems to know where it is headed. It’s quite a welcome development, and the newfound confidence ... makes Quantico a much more enjoyable show to watch." [...] In a five-star review of the sixteenth episode, Kelsey McKinney of New York wrote that [...] "the show is grappling more and more with the emotions <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> all human, not just the ones that drive the story forward." [...] The series' plot lines, involving current political situations, were also praised.|$|E

[...] For his own website, he further {{wrote that the}} clip is [...] "filled with summer sounds and gorgeous visuals that excite [...] for summer" [...] and that [...] "Inna is stylishly sexy". Currinn awarded it {{four out of five}} stars, concluding that [...] "this video totally works, although it's a shame there wasn't a romantic element in the visual". Urban.ro said that the music video is [...] "full of colorful frameworks <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> think about summer", while Russian website Zircular pointed out the absence of a plot and stated that Inna [...] "focuses on the male audience". ZU TV wrote that [...] " [...] and her dancers warm up the atmosphere and make you want to have fun". The music video received notable airplay on Romanian television, peaking at number eight on Media Forest's TV Airplay Chart in April 2017.|$|E
500|$|Eva Bella and Spencer Lacey Ganus {{were cast}} to portray Elsa {{as a young}} child and as a teenager, respectively. Actress and singer Megan Mullally was {{originally}} cast to voice an adult Elsa. but was replaced by Idina Menzel, a Broadway actress and singer best known for performing as Elphaba in Wicked. Menzel already knew Kristen Bell, who voiced Anna, and had previously auditioned for a lead role in the 2010 Disney film Tangled. She was not cast for the part, but the casting director recorded her singing and later showed the recording to Frozens film executives. Menzel was surprised when she was subsequently asked to audition, and she received the role after reading the script out loud. In interviews, she acknowledged similarities between Elsa, her then-current role, and Elphaba, her previous role. Namely, she said, they were both very powerful and very misunderstood individuals. She further said that she related to the characters, having hidden her singing talent from her peers at school. [...] "I didn't want to alienate anyone," [...] she explained. [...] "If everyone was singing along in the car to a Madonna song, I didn't join in because when we're younger we're afraid of sticking out or showing off, when in fact we should own those things <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> really unique." ...|$|E

40|$|Modern genetic {{research}} {{holds out the}} promise of a bold new future in which humanity has identified and conquered the genetic roots of many diseases. Genetic science also promises to shed light on who we are, what it is <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> tick, what it is <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> the way we are — in short, what it is <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>us</b> human. Yet while genetics are a potential saviour (saving us from disease), it also appears as a threat that at the extremes appears to be the stuff of our worst nightmares, such as the prospect, probably more imagined than real, of rows of cloned individuals. The new genetics hold out the promise that through genetics {{we will be able to}} determine what we are, a promise that is simultaneously appealing and terrifying. This chapter discusses the cloning of people and parts, the law’s response to cloning, genetics and diversity, a framework for law reform...|$|R
2500|$|On 16 November 2015 {{the first}} act of Canada's newly {{appointed}} Minister of Justice and Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould was to assure women who chose to wear the niqāb during the Oath of Allegiance {{of their right to}} do so. In December 2011 then-Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney announced a policy directive from the Federal Government under then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper that Muslim women must remove niqābs throughout the citizenship ceremony where they declare their Oath of Allegiance. Zunera Ishaq, a Sunni Muslim woman living in Mississauga, Ontario, challenged and won the niqāb ban in the case of Canada v Ishaq on 05 October 2015. The Federal Court of Appeal decision in her favour was seen by some as [...] "an opportunity to revisit the rules governing the somewhat difficult relationship between law and policy." [...] In October 2015 Harper had appealed the Supreme Court of Canada to take up the case. With the election of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on 19 October 2015, the niqāb debate was settled as the Liberal government chose to not [...] "politicize the issue any further." [...] Minister Wilson-Raybould, who is the first Indigenous person to be named as Justice Minister, explained as she withdrew Harper's appeal to the Supreme Court, [...] "In all of our policy as a government we will ensure that we respect the values <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> Canadians, those of diversity, inclusion and respect for those fundamental values." [...] The Justice Minister spoke with Zunera by telephone to tell her the news prior to making her official announcement.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout Lorde's career she {{included}} {{the idea of}} a collective identity in many of her poems and books. Audre Lorde did not just identify with one category but she wanted to celebrate all parts of herself equally. She was known to describe herself as African-American, black, dyke, feminist, poet, mother, etc. In her novel [...] Lorde focuses on how her many different identities shape her life and the different experiences she has because of them. She shows us that personal identity is found within the connections between seemingly different parts of life. Personal identity is often associated with the visual aspect of a person, but as Lies Xhonneux theorizes when identity is singled down to just to what you see, some people, even within minority groups, can become invisible. In her late book The Cancer Journals she said [...] "If I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive." [...] This is important because an identity is more than just what people see or think of a person, it is something that must be defined by the individual. [...] "The House of Difference" [...] is a phrase that has stuck with Lorde's identity theories. Her idea was that everyone is different from each other and it is the collective differences <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> who we are, instead of one little thing. Focusing on all of the aspects of identity brings people together more than choosing one piece of an identity.|$|E
2500|$|Lexa, and her {{relationship}} with Clarke, have been well received by critics and fans. Maureen Ryan, writing for The Huffington Post, stated, [...] "In a show packed with morally compromised characters, Lexa stood out; she led a tribe of Earth inhabitants named Grounders {{with a combination of}} deftness, intelligence and unhesitating ferocity." [...] Ryan felt Lexa [...] "does not suffer fools gladly, yet Debnam-Carey made Lexa's vulnerability and her attraction to Clarke Griffin (Eliza Taylor) not just believable, but engrossing." [...] Linda Ge of TheWrap referred to her as a fan-favorite, while Eric Goldman of IGN called her [...] "a standout, highly popular character". The staff for SheWired stated that she [...] "had the best character introduction ever and never stopped being great" [...] and [...] "has proven to be endlessly engaging, even when she's making choices <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> want to crawl into a ball and cry." [...] Dana Piccoli of AfterEllen.com characterized Lexa as a [...] "mysterious queer character" [...] that has caught the audience's attention, and complimented the [...] "chemistry and increasing bond between Lexa and Clarke," [...] adding, [...] "Both are smart, and somehow manage to see the bigger picture. [...] Here are two young women, leading their people to salvation or at least as close to salvation as they can get." [...] The A.V. Clubs Kyle Fowle reasoned that Lexa's resolve while facing the reality of protecting the Sky People, the 13th clan, while risking an uprising from the other clans and her own people [...] "is exactly what makes her one of the better characters on TV." [...] Hypable.com's Selina Wilken said that she was [...] "one of the best and, yes, most divisive characters in recent TV history." ...|$|E
