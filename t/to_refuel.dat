5|$|For {{some species}} of waders, {{migration}} success {{depends on the}} availability of certain key food resources at stopover points along the migration route. This gives the migrants an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>refuel</b> for the next leg of the voyage. Some examples of important stopover locations are the Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay.|$|E
5|$|In the autumn, species {{arrive from}} the north, some, such as black-tailed godwits, curlew {{sandpipers}} and little stints just passing through, pausing {{for a few}} days <b>to</b> <b>refuel,</b> others staying for the winter. This is also a good time to see bearded reedlings. Offshore, great and Arctic skuas, northern gannets and black-legged kittiwakes may pass close by in favourable winds.|$|E
5|$|AJ tankers {{were used}} <b>to</b> <b>refuel</b> John Glenn's Vought F8U-1P Crusader during the Project Bullet transcontinental speed record flight in July 1957; AJ-2s from VAH-6 on the West Coast and AJ-1s from VAH-11 on the East Coast. Beginning in 1957 the Douglas A3D Skywarrior began {{to replace the}} Savages in the VAH Squadrons. Their {{refueling}} role was continued by the formation in January 1958 of VAH-15 on East Coast and VAH-16 on the West Coast. Both squadrons were equipped with AJ-2s, but both were short-lived and disbanded early the following year.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Marschall {{organized}} {{a mission to}} seize Harstad in early June 1940; Admiral Hipper, the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, and four destroyers were tasked with the operation. The ships departed on 4 June, and while en route, Admiral Hipper encountered and sank the empty troopship Orama on 9 June. Before they reached Harstad, the Germans learned that the Allies had already abandoned the port. Marschall's squadron was then tasked with intercepting an Allied convoy that {{was reported to be}} in the area. The ships failed to find the convoy, and returned to Trondheim <b>to</b> <b>refuel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the wide}} range of tasks which have been {{assigned}} to the aircraft, the RAAF is currently not operating its Globemasters in all the roles of which the type is capable. For instance, in February 2013 the Air Force was reported to be investigating using C-17s to drop special forces boats as well as supplies to warships. Trials to develop the capacity <b>to</b> <b>refuel</b> RAAF Globemasters in flight from the force's Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports began in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|In May 1944, Nos.1, 18 and 31 Squadrons {{attacked}} Japanese {{positions in}} Timor, while No.2 Squadron was withdrawn from combat to re-equip with Mitchells. No.79 Wing's light and medium bombers {{suffered from a}} lack of suitable targets as they had few airfields in forward areas from which <b>to</b> <b>refuel.</b> No.2 Squadron returned to operations with Mitchells in June. That month, No.18 Squadron flew 149 sorties, damaging Japanese airfields and shipping in the Timor area, but lost its commanding officer to anti-aircraft fire during a raid.|$|E

5|$|Of the 108 Japanese {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} this attack, 11 were destroyed, 14 were heavily damaged, and 29 were damaged to some degree. The initial Japanese attack {{did not succeed in}} neutralizing Midway: American bombers could still use the airbase <b>to</b> <b>refuel</b> and attack the Japanese invasion force, and most of Midway's land-based defenses were intact. Japanese pilots reported to Nagumo that a second aerial attack on Midway's defenses would be necessary if troops were to go ashore by 7 June.|$|E

As they neared land Braham and Walsh noticed a slight whine in the aircraft's radio speakers meaning the Mosquito was being tracked by radar.|$|E

50|$|With the {{acquisition}} of KC-97 Stratotankers from SAC, the 106th gaining command returned to Tactical Air Command in September 1969 and the it became the 106th Air Refueling Wing. Its mission was <b>to</b> provide air <b>refueling</b> <b>to</b> tactical fighter and reconnaissance aircraft. The KC-97 was {{a variant of the}} C-97 Stratofreighter and the conversion of the unit from transports <b>to</b> <b>refueling</b> aircraft was easily accomplished. The wing's KC-97Ls had added jet engine pods mounted on their outboard wings. It rotated personnel and aircraft to West Germany as part of Operation Creek Party, a continuous rotational mission flying from Rhein Main Air Base, West Germany, providing air <b>refueling</b> <b>to</b> United States Air Forces in Europe tactical aircraft. The success of this operation, which would continue until 1972, demonstrated the ability of the Air National Guard to perform significant day-to-day missions without being mobilized.|$|R
5|$|On the {{previous}} day, the three airmen from the squadron had scouted the target area south of Tchepone in a two engine CIA aircraft piloted by a civilian employee. The pilot {{had failed to}} load enough fuel on the reconnaissance aircraft and had <b>to</b> <b>refuel</b> at a Laotian base on the return trip to Udorn. Since United States armed forces personnel were never officially acknowledged as being in Laos, the United States Ambassador to Laos became enraged that U.S. personnel had been spotted in uniform at the remote refueling field in Laos.|$|E
5|$|The Tornado is {{cleared to}} carry the {{majority}} of air-launched weapons in the NATO inventory, including various unguided and laser-guided bombs, anti-ship and anti-radiation missiles, as well as specialised weapons such as anti-personnel mines and anti-runway munitions. To improve survivability in combat, the Tornado is equipped with onboard countermeasures, ranging from flare and chaff dispensers to electronic countermeasure pods that can be mounted under the wings. Underwing fuel tanks and a buddy store aerial refuelling system that allows one Tornado <b>to</b> <b>refuel</b> another are available to extend the aircraft's range.|$|E
5|$|The convoy {{arrived at}} Addu Atoll {{on the evening}} of 9 February, and {{anchored}} there <b>to</b> <b>refuel</b> and take on supplies. This atoll served as a secret supply base for Allied vessels in the Indian Ocean, and the Australian soldiers were not told where they were while the refuelling took place. The troops were also not permitted to go ashore, but regarded the sight of the tropical atoll as a welcome change from the arid Middle East. After the ships were refuelled, the convoy sailed on the afternoon of 10 February.|$|E

5|$|The oil {{terminal}} supplied 30% of Heathrow Airport's fuel, {{and because}} of the fire, the airport had to start rationing fuel. Some long-haul flights to Australia, the Far East, and South Africa had to make an intermediate stop at Stansted Airport or other European airports <b>to</b> <b>refuel,</b> while short-haul operators were asked to fuel their aircraft for the round trip before flying to Heathrow. Some aircraft were only allowed 40% of the fuel they would normally take on board. Fuel shortages continued for months after the explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{qualifying}} {{session on}} Saturday afternoon was split into threeparts. The first part ran for 20minutes and eliminated the cars from qualifying that finished the session 16th or lower. The {{second part of}} qualifying lasted 15minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions11 to 15. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth, and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final session of qualifying were not allowed <b>to</b> <b>refuel</b> before the race, and as such carried more fuel {{than in the previous}} sessions.|$|E
5|$|The {{squadron}} operates five Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports, {{the first}} of which entered service in June 2011. Two more are due for delivery in 2018. The aircraft are crewed by pilots, refuelling operators and flight attendants. Air-to-air refuelling is considered a force multiplier, permitting the RAAF to increase the range and loiter time of its aircraft. The ability <b>to</b> <b>refuel</b> in flight also enables aircraft to take off with more ordnance than they might otherwise.|$|E
