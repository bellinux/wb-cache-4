5|$|Al-Rahba {{came under}} Hamdanid rule {{a few years}} later, {{becoming}} part of <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> district (tariq al-Furat) of the Mosul-based emirate. At the time, the town was described by the Persian geographer al-Istakhri, as being larger than the ancient Circesium {{on the opposite side}} of <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates.</b> The lord of al-Rahba, Jaman, rebelled against the Hamdanid emir of Mosul, Nasir al-Dawla (r. 929–967). Jaman fled the town and drowned in <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> but not before al-Rahba was heavily damaged in the rebellion's suppression. Nasir al-Dawla granted his favored son, Abu'l Muzzafar Hamdan, control of al-Rahba, its district of Diyar Mudar, and the district's revenues.|$|E
5|$|Research {{indicates}} that the salinity of <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> water in Iraq has increased considerably since the nearly simultaneous construction of the Keban Dam in Turkey and the Tabqa Dam in Syria. This increase can, among other things, {{be related to the}} lower discharge of <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> {{as a result of the}} construction of the Keban Dam and the dams of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) in Turkey, and to a lesser degree of the Tabqa Dam in Syria. High-salinity water is less useful for domestic and irrigation purposes.|$|E
5|$|Since Palmyra {{was not on}} {{the main}} trading route (which {{followed}} <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates),</b> the Palmyrenes secured the desert route passing their city. They connected it to <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> valley, providing water and shelter. The Palmyrene route connected the Silk Road with the Mediterranean, and was used almost exclusively by the city's merchants, who maintained a presence in many cities, including Dura-Europos in 33 BC, Babylon by AD 19, Seleucia by AD 24, Dendera, Coptos, Bahrain, the Indus River Delta, Merv and Rome.|$|E

5|$|Mari is not {{considered}} a small settlement that later grew, but rather a new city that was purposely founded during the Mesopotamian Early Dynastic period I c. 2900 BC, to control the waterways of <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> trade routes that connect the Levant with the Sumerian south. The city was built about 1 to 2 kilometers away from <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> river {{to protect it from}} floods, and was connected to the river by an artificial canal that was between 7 and 10 kilometers long depending on which old meander it used to be attached with, which is hard to identify today.|$|E
5|$|Salih {{launched}} {{his career in}} 1008/09 when he seized al-Rahba on <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> River. In 1012, he was imprisoned and tortured by the emir of Aleppo, Mansur ibn Lu'lu; two years later, he escaped, captured Mansur in battle and released him in return for numerous concessions, including half of Aleppo's revenues. This action cemented Salih as the paramount emir of his Banu Kilab tribe, many of whose chieftains had died in Mansur's dungeons. With his Bedouin warriors, Salih captured a string of fortresses along <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates,</b> including Manbij and Raqqa, by 1022. He later formed an alliance with the Banu Kalb and Banu Tayy and militarily supported their struggle against the Fatimids. During this tribal rebellion, Salih annexed the central Syrian towns of Hims, Ba'albak and Sidon before finally conquering Fatimid-held Aleppo in 1025.|$|E

5|$|The exact route {{taken by}} Odaenathus from Palmyra to Ctesiphon remains uncertain; it is {{probably}} similar to the route emperor Julian took in 363 during his campaign against Persia. Using this route, Odaenathus would have crossed <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> at Zeugma then moved east to Edessa followed by Carrhae then Nisibis; here, he would have descended south along the Khabur River to <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> valley and marched alongside the river's left bank to Nehardea. After taking the city, he penetrated the Sassanian province of Asōristān and marched along the royal canal Naarmalcha towards the Tigris where the Persian capital stood.|$|E
5|$|The two Roman forces met on {{the banks}} of <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> near Melitene, amidst scenes of mutual grief; while Corbulo lamented the undoing of his achievements, Paetus tried to {{convince}} him to attempt to reverse the situation by invading Armenia. Corbulo however refused, claiming {{that he did not have}} the authority to do so, and that either way the army was too worn out to be able to campaign effectively. In the end, Paetus retired to Cappadocia and Corbulo to Syria, where he received envoys from Vologases, who demanded that he evacuate his bridgehead over <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates.</b> In turn, Corbulo demanded the Parthian evacuation of Armenia. Vologases agreed to this, and both sides withdrew their forces, leaving Armenia once again masterless but de facto under Parthian control, until a Parthian delegation could travel to Rome.|$|E

5|$|Halab's {{location}} {{has always}} been a factor in its prominence as an economic center.

5|$|In 1264, the Mamluk sultan Baybars (r. 1260–1277) {{replaced}} the Ayyubid governor of al-Rahba {{with one of}} his mamluk officers from Egypt. Al-Rahba's garrison and its commander held a high place in the Mamluk military hierarchy. The fortress, along with and al-Bira to the north, emerged as the principal Mamluk bulwark against Mongol invasions of Syria's eastern frontier. It was the Mamluks' most important fortress along <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates,</b> supplanting Raqqa, which had been the traditional Muslim center in <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> valley since the 10th century. A large population of refugees from areas ruled by the Mongols settled in al-Rahba as did many people from the adjacent, unfortified town of Mashhad al-Rahba (former site of Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk, modern-day Mayadin). It was also the terminal stop of the Mamluk barid (postal route) and an administrative center.|$|E

5|$|In 903, the Qarmatian leader al-Husayn ibn Zikrawayh {{was imprisoned}} in al-Rahba before being {{transferred}} to Caliph al-Mustakfi's custody in Raqqa. At the time, al-Rahba {{was the center}} of <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> province and headquarters of its governor, Ibn Sima. Al-Husayn was executed, prompting his partisans from the Banu Ullays tribe to submit to Ibn Sima in al-Rahba in early 904. However, shortly after, they turned against Ibn Sima, whose forces routed them in an ambush in al-Rahba's environs in August. Following further battles, Ibn Sima received another round of surrenders by Qarmatian chieftains and da'is (Ismaili religious leaders). In March 928, the Qarmatians under Abu Tahir al-Jannabi conquered al-Rahba and massacred scores of its inhabitants. Its residents faced hardships for several more years due to civil strife in the surrounding region. Peace was established in 942 with the arrival of a certain Abbasid commander named Adl who was dispatched by Bajkam, the strongman of the Baghdad-based caliphate. Adl subsequently became governor of <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> and Khabur valley regions.|$|E
5|$|Paetus {{nonetheless}} appeared {{confident of}} victory, {{and followed the}} Parthian declaration of war and capture of Tigranocerta with his own invasion of Armenia, while Corbulo remained at Syria, further strengthening the fortifications in <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> frontier.

A few minor forts were taken, but a lack of supplies forced him to withdraw westwards for the winter.|$|E

5|$|The {{invasion}} of Egypt is sometimes explained by Zenobia's desire to secure an alternative trade route to <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates,</b> which was cut {{because of the}} war with Persia; This theory ignores the fact that <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> route was only partially disrupted, and overlooks Zenobia's ambition. The date of the campaign is uncertain; Zosimus placed it after the Battle of Naissus and before Claudius' death, which sets it in the summer of 270. Watson, emphasizing the works of Zonaras and Syncellus and dismissing Zosimus' account, places the invasion in October 270 (after Claudius' death). According to Watson, the occupation of Egypt was an opportunistic move by Zenobia (who was encouraged by the news of Claudius' death in August). The appearance of the Palmyrenes on Egypt's eastern frontier would have contributed to unrest in the province, whose society was fractured; Zenobia had supporters and opponents among local Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|Using {{his newfound}} power, Salih {{captured}} <b>the</b> <b>Euphrates</b> towns of Manbij and Balis, located east and southeast of Aleppo, respectively.
