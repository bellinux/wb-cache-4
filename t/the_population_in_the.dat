However, some areas of Algeria had high concentrations of Pieds-Noirs, such as the regions of Bône (now Annaba), Algiers, and above all the area from Oran to Sidi-Bel-Abbès. Oran had been under European rule since the 17th century, and <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Oran metropolitan area was 49.3% European and Jewish in 1959. In the Algiers metropolitan area, Europeans and Jewish people accounted for 35.7% of <b>the</b> <b>population.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> metropolitan area of Bône they accounted for 40.5% of the population. The département of Oran, a rich European-developed agricultural land of 16,520km² (6,378 sq. miles) stretching between the cities of Oran and Sidi-Bel-Abbès, and including them, was the area of highest Pied-Noir density outside of the cities, with the Pieds-Noirs accounting for 33.6% {{of the population of the}} département in 1959.|$|E

5|$|Abir re-established their {{headquarters}} at Basankusu in 1893 and its {{position at the}} confluence of the Maringa and Lopori allowed Abir to expand along the rivers and their tributaries, establishing new posts along the way.

The company's first post on the Lopori River had to be relocated because of threats from locals and rubber collection at Befori began only after a series of bloody conflicts between the villagers and Abir's men.|$|E

Nowadays, in an area known locally as Church Paddock, there are Anglican, Catholic and Adventist churches, the religious affiliations on the island being 30% Anglican, 22% no religion, 18% Catholic and 12% Seventh Day Adventist.

5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} are not endangered. Their {{future is}} stable {{because of their}} abundance and adaptability. However, specific populations are threatened due to various environmental changes. <b>The</b> <b>population</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Moray Firth in Scotland is estimated to consist of around 190 individuals, and are under threat from harassment, traumatic injury, water pollution and reduction in food availability. Likewise, an isolated population in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand, is in decline due to calf loss coincident {{to an increase in}} warm freshwater discharge into the fjord. Less local climate change, such as increasing water temperature may also play a role but has never been shown to be the case. One of the largest coastal populations of bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia was forecast to be stable with little variation in mortality over time (Manlik et al. 2016).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{reproducing}} readily {{in captivity}} {{and being the}} most populous lemur in zoos worldwide, numbering more than 2,000 individuals, the ring-tailed lemur is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List due to habitat destruction and hunting for bush meat and the exotic pet trade.

5|$|Despite the {{disbanding}} of the camps, {{the defeated}} {{forces of the}} former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu.

In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime's military into the RPF-dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency. These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, <b>the</b> <b>population</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north west had stopped supporting the insurgency and the insurgents were mostly defeated.|$|E

The total population of Asian elephants {{is estimated to be}} around 40,000–50,000, although this may be a loose estimate. It is likely that around half of the population is in India.

5|$|In a dissenting opinion, a {{systematic}} review of four head-to-head comparative trials of metformin and clomifene found them equally effective for infertility.

Metformin should {{be used as a}} second-line drug if clomifene treatment fails. Another review recommended metformin unreservedly as a first-line treatment option because it has positive effects not only on anovulation, but also on insulin resistance, hirsutism and obesity often associated with PCOS. A Cochrane Collaboration review found metformin improves ovulation and pregnancy rates, particularly when combined with clomifene, but is not associated with {{an increase in the number}} of live births.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, common {{starlings}} {{are exempt}} from the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which prohibits the taking or killing of migratory birds. No permit is required to remove nests and eggs or kill juveniles or adults. Research was undertaken in 1966 to identify a suitable avicide that would both kill common starlings and would readily be eaten by them. It also needed to be of low toxicity to mammals and not likely to cause the death of pets that ate dead birds. The chemical that best fitted these criteria was DRC-1339, now marketed as Starlicide. In 2008, the United States government poisoned, shot or trapped 1.7million birds, {{the largest number of}} any nuisance species to be destroyed.
