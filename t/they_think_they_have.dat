5|$|Mozart had a pet common {{starling}} {{which could}} sing {{part of his}} Piano Concerto in G Major (KV. 453). He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously, which {{had not yet been}} performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his A Musical Joke (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's vocalisation. Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions. The words have no meaning for the starling, so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> just heard speak.|$|E
500|$|... "Son of a Gun" [...] {{was also}} the first of five Homicide: Life on the Street episodes {{featuring}} Mel Proctor, then the home team sports announcer for the Washington Bullets, as recurring reporter character Grant Besser. Actor Walt MacPherson made a brief appearance as a uniformed police officer who finds an earring at the Adena Watson crime scene and offers it to Bayliss as possible evidence. MacPherson would return in the [...] as the recurring character Detective Roger Gaffney, but there is no indication whether or not the beat cop he played in [...] "Son of a Gun" [...] was the same character. The line spoken by Lewis, [...] "Murderers lie because they have to, witnesses lie because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to, and everyone else lies for the sheer joy of it", is almost a verbatim line from Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. The line represents a three-rule theorem about police work Simon created after following a Baltimore Police Department homicide unit for one year while writing his book.|$|E

5000|$|Communicating high {{expectations}} has {{shown to be}} very successful. Expectations that teachers implement give students a gage for how much potential <b>they</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have.</b>|$|R

6000|$|So you {{see that}} even a princess is not always happy--especially if she forgets to keep her word; and the {{greatest}} misfortunes often happen to people just as <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> obtained their heart's desires!(1) ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘And because I {{am happy}} and dance and sing, <b>They</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> done me no injury, And are gone to praise God and His priest and king, Who {{made up a}} heaven of our misery.’ ...|$|E
5000|$|Our foes {{are strong}} and wise and wary; but, strong and wise and wary as they are, they cannot undo the miracles of God who ripens {{in the hearts}} of young men the seeds sown by the young men of a former generation. And the seeds sown by the young men of '65 and '67 are coming to their miraculous {{ripening}} today. Rulers and Defenders of the Realm had need to be wary if they would guard against such processes. Life springs from death; and from the graves of patriot men and women spring living nations. The Defenders of this Realm have worked well in secret and in the open. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> pacified Ireland. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> purchased half of us and intimidated the other half. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> foreseen everything, <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> provided against everything; but, the fools, the fools, the fools! - <b>They</b> <b>have</b> left us our Fenian dead, and while Ireland holds these graves, Ireland unfree shall never be at peace.

50|$|Aadesh told {{both of his}} {{students}} that {{he wants them to}} win only if they deserve it, and if at any point <b>they</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> picked up the song and are given green cards, they should not take it, and on the other hand, if <b>they</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> sung better than the others, don't say that the other one deserved it. Keka said that this is the reason why she, when asked yesterday, had said that she deserved yellow. Aadesh did point out that her voice is not ok and she is sick but he is not saying this as excuse.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose, sir, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{the same}} right to sail on the ocean that others have. Seals and whales are the gifts of God, and one person has no more right to them than another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, dear Duncan," [...] she said, [...] "that, {{although}} I {{believe you}} to be quite innocent, most of the half-breeds are of the opposite opinion, {{and some of them}} are very revengeful, especially when <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been deceived or unjustly treated." ...|$|E
60|$|Then, I have no doubt, he repented fully of all {{the said}} naughty things which he had done, and promised to mend his life, as too many do when <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> no life left to mend. Whereby, as they fancy, they make a very cheap bargain. But the old fairy with the birch rod soon undeceives them.|$|E
6000|$|DON JUAN. [impatiently] Oh, I beg you not {{to begin}} talking about love. Here they talk of nothing else but love--its beauty, its holiness, its spirituality, its devil knows what!--excuse me; but it does so bore me. They don't know what they're talking about. I do. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{achieved}} the perfection of love {{because they have no}} bodies. Sheer imaginative debauchery! Faugh! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The time is just at hand now, cap. The redskins {{are tired}} of waiting. At least, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> better not put it off any longer. They know, {{as well as we}} do, that it won't do to wait till it gets dark.|$|R

5000|$|FlyLady {{asserts that}} the most {{frequent}} reason for procrastination and inefficacy is perfectionism, as people won't start a task if <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> don't <b>have</b> the time {{or the ability to}} do it perfectly. Some frequently repeated sayings in this respect are [...] "good enough is good enough" [...] or [...] "housework done incorrectly still blesses your family".|$|R
6000|$|... "Evidently <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{some sort}} of claim on the Spell land," [...] {{answered}} Dick Rover. [...] "And {{it is possible that}} such is a fact, because, as I said before, the title to Spell's land seemed to be clouded. Of course, I don't know what is in the documents in the safe-deposit vault at Wichita Falls. Those documents may clear the matter up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would not}} be worth while, Allan," [...] his father said. [...] "They will all make stout men-at-arms some day, {{and will have to}} fight under my banner. I care as little as any man what my vassals think of me, seeing that {{whatsoever}} <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> to do mine orders. But it needs not to set them against one needlessly; so let the varlets go on with their play undisturbed." ...|$|E
6000|$|The teacher smiled. [...] "Well, then, the savages {{could not}} {{conceive}} {{it possible that}} {{for the sake of}} a girl you would voluntarily lose your fine vessel; therefore, as long as she lies here, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> you all safe. So I suggest that we get a quantity of stores conveyed to a sequestered part of the shore, provide a small canoe, put Avatea on board, and you three would paddle to the Christian island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One cannot {{say what}} may be possible," [...] she {{answered}} slowly. [...] "I suppose they would not go on with it if <b>they</b> did not <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> some chance of success." ...|$|R

25|$|Carmen Carlson (Allyn Ann McLerie) is Mr. Carlson's sweet-natured wife. Though happily married, {{they are}} so anxious to avoid hurting each other's {{feelings}} that they rarely tell each other what <b>they</b> really <b>think.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> a son, Arthur Carlson, Jr., whom they've sent off to military school. During the second season Carmen has a surprise pregnancy and during the third season gives birth to a daughter, Melanie.|$|R
60|$|The {{last man}} being gone, Mr Gregsbury {{rubbed his hands}} and chuckled, as merry fellows will, when <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> said or done a more than {{commonly}} good thing; he was so engrossed in this self-congratulation, {{that he did not}} observe that Nicholas had been left behind {{in the shadow of the}} window-curtains, until that young gentleman, fearing he might otherwise overhear some soliloquy intended to have no listeners, coughed twice or thrice, to attract the member's notice.|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord Hurachi, I {{have heard}} from my {{daughter}} how she found you in the sea, a story indeed. I have also heard, or guessed, it matters not which, that her heart has turned towards you, as is not strange, seeing the manner of man you are, if indeed you be not more than man, and that women are ever prone to love those whom <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> saved. Is this true, my lord Hurachi?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{that every}} {{imagination}} of the thoughts of his heart, was only evil continually." [...] If <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not sinned; {{if they think they}} promote religion; if they think to find out a medium to make peace between the seed of the woman, and the wicked seed of Cain; all is alike ungodly, they have forsaken the right way, they have dissembled the known truth, they have rejected the word of the Lord: And what wisdom or goodness is in them? ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{woman in}} the shop {{answered}} me without hesitation that {{it was to be}} at eight o'clock in the morning. [...] "You see, Watson, no mystery; everything above-board! In some way the legal forms have undoubtedly been complied with, and <b>they</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> little to fear. Well, there's nothing for it now but a direct frontal attack. Are you armed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are {{ripe for}} mischief," [...] said Labienus. [...] "And who can wonder, {{when it is}} we {{soldiers}} who uphold the Empire upon our spears, while the lazy citizens at Rome reap all of our sowing. Why cannot a soldier have what a soldier gains? So long as they throw us our denarius a day, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> done with us." ...|$|R
5000|$|Following the interment, Pearse {{delivered}} his oration. He spoke [...] "on {{behalf of a}} new generation that has been re-baptised in the Fenian faith" [...] and called on the Irish people to stand together for the achievement of the freedom of Ireland. And, he said, [...] "we know only one definition of freedom: it is Tone's definition, it is Mitchel's definition, it is Rossa's definition" [...] (that is, an Irish Republic). The tone of the oration {{made it very clear that}} an attempt would soon be made to establish an Irish Republic by force of arms. The oration concluded with a challenge to the [...] "Defenders of this Realm":They <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> pacified Ireland. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> purchased half of us and intimidated the other half. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> foreseen everything, <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> provided against everything; but the fools, the fools, the fools! - <b>they</b> <b>have</b> left us our Fenian dead, and while Ireland holds these graves, Ireland unfree shall never be at peace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind. We'll see {{you through}} among us. I only wonder {{the doctor has}} not heard, for it's {{all over the country}} that you are to fight the Croxley Champion. We've had Armitage up about it already. He's the Master's backer, you know. He wasn't sure that you were {{eligible}}. The Master said he wanted you whether you were eligible or not. Armitage has money on, and would have made trouble if he could. But I showed him that you came within the conditions of the challenge, and he agreed that it was all right. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a soft thing on." ...|$|E
60|$|The wood-cutters and peasants {{take off}} their coats, their throats are bare. They dance with strange intentness, {{particularly}} if they have for partner an English Signora. Their feet in thick boots are curiously swift and significant. And it is strange to see the Englishwomen, as they dance with the peasants transfigured {{with a kind of}} brilliant surprise. All the while the peasants are very courteous, but quiet. They see the women dilate and flash, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> found a footing, they are certain. So the male dancers are quiet, but even grandiloquent, their feet nimble, their bodies wild and confident.|$|E
6000|$|... "How can you ask such a question?" [...] Pierre said, indignantly. [...] "Of course, {{if you go}} I go, too. There is {{not much}} danger in the affair; and if there were, what then? We have gone through plenty of it, together. It will not be, now, as when we made our escape. Then they were hunting down the Huguenots like mad dogs. Now <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> exterminated them in Paris, and {{will no longer be}} on the lookout for them. It will be easy enough to come and go, without being observed; and if we find Monsieur Francois, we will bring him out with us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pah!" [...] Bagheera grunted. [...] "This {{place is}} rank with Man, {{but here is}} just such a bed as they gave me to lie upon in the King's cages at Oodeypore. Now I lie down." [...] Mowgli heard the strings of the cot crack under the great brute's weight. [...] "By the Broken Lock that freed me, <b>they</b> will <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> caught big game! Come and sit beside me, Little Brother; we will give them 'good hunting' together!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my fair lord, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{learned their}} lesson," [...] said Chandos. [...] "Because {{we have had}} good fortune upon our feet at Crecy and {{elsewhere}} <b>they</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> found the trick of it. But it is {{in my mind that}} it is very different to stand when you are assailed, as we have done, and to assail others when you must drag your harness for a mile and come weary to the fray." ...|$|R
60|$|Lord John Russell has {{informed}} us of an understanding between the British and French governments {{that they will}} act together in regard to our affairs. This communication, however, loses something of its value from the circumstance that the communication was withheld until after knowledge of the fact had been acquired by us from other sources. We know also another fact {{that has not yet}} been officially communicated to us--namely, that other European States are apprised by France and England of their agreement, and are expected to concur with or follow them in whatever measures they adopt on the subject of recognition. The United States have been impartial and just in all their conduct toward the several nations of Europe. They will not complain, however, of the combination now announced by the two leading powers, although <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a right to expect a more independent, if not a more friendly, course from each of them. You will take no notice of that or any other alliance. Whenever the European governments shall see fit to communicate directly with us, we shall be, as heretofore, frank and explicit in our reply.|$|R
