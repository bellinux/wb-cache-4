The objectives of this study were to compare the results from a culture-based mastitis pathogen detection <b>test</b> <b>kit</b> (‘VetoRapid’, Vétoquinol) with standard laboratory culture and to evaluate the potential suitability of the <b>test</b> <b>kit</b> to inform a selective treatment programme. Overall 231 quarter milk samples from five UK dairy farms were collected.

Several occurrences of misidentification are reported, including S. aureus being misidentified as coagulase-negative staphylococci and vice versa.

40|$|The {{resistance}} <b>testing</b> <b>kit</b> is an assay {{to receive}} very quickly {{detailed information about}} the behaviour of adult insects in a phosphine atmosphere. The used concentration of 3, 000 ppm has a narcotic effect on non-resistant insects within a few minutes. Insects with a low phosphine susceptibility are still active after this time period. Using the resistance <b>testing</b> <b>kit</b> we succeed {{to distinguish between the}} tolerance of different insect species, the tolerance of one species at different concentrations and of different temperature regimes. The evaluation of different concentrations of phosphine, of their effectiveness against resistant strains of Lasioderma serricorne shows that at usual fumigation conditions resistant beetles can not be controlled with phosphine whereas at higher concentration 100 %-mortality of all development stages is achieved. Furthermore, longer exposure times have also a positive effect on the mortality of all development stages. The results confirm that the resistance <b>testing</b> <b>kit</b> is an effective device to recognize the resistance in an early stage, to fight against the development of resistance and to fight against the spreading of resistance. In future the resistance <b>testing</b> <b>kit</b> should be part of an integrated pest management system and a requirement for a good fumigation practice.

Over-the-counter urine <b>test</b> <b>kits</b> only test for date rape drugs that are benzodiazepines, and GHB is not a benzodiazepine. To detect GHB in urine, the sample must be taken within four hours of GHB ingestion, and cannot be tested at home. GHB {{can be detected}} in hair for months after GHB ingestion. Other drugs, such as muscle relaxers (Carisoprodol for example), are sometimes mixed with GHB. Therefore, it can be beneficial to request that the hair sample be tested for multiple drugs.|$|E

2500|$|Radon is an invisible, {{radioactive}} atomic {{gas that}} results from the radioactive decay of radium, which {{may be found in}} rock formations beneath buildings or in certain building materials themselves. [...] Radon is probably the most pervasive serious hazard for indoor air in the United States and Europe, probably responsible {{for tens of thousands of}} deaths from lung cancer each year. There are relatively simple <b>test</b> <b>kits</b> for do-it-yourself radon gas testing, but if a home is for sale the testing must be done by licensed person in some U.S. states. Radon gas enters buildings as a soil gas and is a heavy gas and thus will tend to accumulate at the lowest level. Radon may also be introduced into a building through drinking water particularly from bathroom showers. Building materials can be a rare source of radon, but little testing is carried out for stone, rock or tile products brought into building sites; radon accumulation is greatest for well insulated homes. The half life for radon is 3.8 days, indicating that once the source is removed, the hazard will be greatly reduced within a few weeks. Radon mitigation methods include sealing concrete slab floors, basement foundations, water drainage systems, or by increasing ventilation. They are usually cost effective and can greatly reduce or even eliminate the contamination and the associated health risks.|$|E
