5|$|Hafnium is a shiny, silvery, {{ductile metal}} that is {{corrosion-resistant}} and chemically similar to zirconium (due to its {{having the same}} number of valence electrons, being in the same group, but also to relativistic effects; the expected expansion of atomic radii from period 5 to 6 is almost exactly cancelled out by the lanthanide contraction). The physical properties of hafnium metal samples are markedly affected by zirconium impurities, especially the nuclear properties, as these two elements are among <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> separate because of their chemical similarity.|$|E

5|$|These organisms {{appear to}} form two groups: the fractal rangeomorphs and the simpler erniettomorphs. Including such fossils as the iconic Charnia and Swartpuntia, {{the group is}} both the most iconic of the Ediacaran biota and <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> place within the {{existing}} tree of life. Lacking any mouth, gut, reproductive organs, or indeed any evidence of internal anatomy, their lifestyle was somewhat peculiar by modern standards; the most widely accepted hypothesis holds that they sucked nutrients out of the surrounding seawater by osmotrophy or osmosis. However, others argue against this.|$|E
5|$|According to {{production}} staff, scenes involving the alien queen were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> film. A life-sized mock-up {{was created by}} Stan Winston's company in the United States {{to see how it}} would operate. Once the testing was complete, the crew working on the queen flew to England and began work creating the final version. Standing at 14 feet (4.3 m) tall, it was operated using a mixture of puppeteers, control rods, hydraulics, cables, and a crane above to support it. Two puppeteers were inside the suit operating its arms, and 16 were required to move it. All sequences involving the full size queen were filmed in-camera with no post-production manipulation. Additionally, a miniature alien queen was used for certain shots.|$|E
5|$|The 400-year period {{following}} {{the collapse of}} Roman rule is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> interpret {{in the history of}} Wales. After the Roman departure from Britain in AD 410, much of the lowlands of Britain to the east and south-east was overrun by various Germanic peoples. Before extensive studies of the distribution of R1b Y-DNA subclades, some previously maintained that native Britons were displaced by the invaders. This idea has been discarded in the face of evidence that much of the population has, at the latest, Hallstatt era origins, but probably late Neolithic, or at earliest Mesolithic origins with little contribution from Anglo-Saxon source areas.|$|E

5|$|After Trespass was recorded, {{ill health}} and {{developing}} stage fright caused Phillips to leave Genesis. His last show {{with the band}} took place in Haywards Heath on 18 July 1970. He felt the increased number of gigs affected the group's creativity and that several songs he wrote were not recorded or performed live. He had contracted bronchial pneumonia and became isolated {{from the rest of}} the band, feeling that it had too many songwriters in it. Banks, Gabriel, and Rutherford saw Phillips as an important member, being the most instrumental in encouraging them to turn professional. They regarded his exit as the band's greatest threat and <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> overcome. Gabriel and Rutherford decided they would continue; Banks agreed on the condition that they find a new drummer that was of equal stature to the rest of the group. Mayhew was therefore fired, though Phillips later thought Mayhew's working-class background clashed with the rest of the band which affected his confidence.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his work}} on the Smithsonian, but before the Scott Building {{finished}} construction, Alexander traveled to New England, where he was assigned to a project at the entrance of Boston harbor. That project, the rebuilding of Minot's Ledge Lighthouse, was widely considered to be one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> be attempted by the U.S. Government up to that time. Designed by Brigadier General Joseph Totten, head of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the lighthouse was intended to replace a structure that had been destroyed in an 1851 storm. With multiple ships wrecking on the ledge annually, the need for a lighthouse was crucial. Appointed superintendent of the lighthouse construction in April 1855, newly promoted Captain Alexander modified Totten's design in accordance with conditions at the site. Because the site of the lighthouse was continually awash, except at low tide and calm seas, the work of preparing the interlocking granite blocks and iron framework of the lighthouse was done at nearby Government Island, adjacent to Cohasset, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{surfaces}} {{are decorated with}} scenes in basse-taille enamel with translucent colours that reflect light from the gold beneath; many areas of gold both underneath the enamel and in the background have engraved and pointillé decoration worked in the gold. In particular the decoration features large areas of translucent red, which have survived in excellent condition. This colour, known as rouge clair, was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> achieve technically, and highly prized for this and {{the brilliance of the}} colour when it was done successfully. Scenes from the life of Saint Agnes run round the top of the cover and the sloping underside of the main body. The symbols of the Four Evangelists run round the foot of the cup, and there are enamel medallions at the centre of the inside of both the cup and the cover. The lower of the two added bands contains enamel Tudor roses on a diapered pointillé background; this was apparently added under HenryVIII. The upper band has an engraved inscription filled in with black enamel, with a barrier of laurel branches in green to mark off the end of the inscription from its beginning.|$|E

5|$|The stage {{premiere of}} She Has a Name was {{directed}} by Waldschmidt, who was also the scenic designer. Aaron Krogman was selected to portray Jason and the unnamed pimp, Sienna Howell-Holden to portray Mama, Glenda Warkentin to portray Marta, Denise Wong to portray Number 18, and Cari Russell to portray Ali. Waldschmidt suggested that Warkentin audition for the play after seeing her perform at Rosebud Theatre in Rosebud, Alberta. Wong, Krogman, and Kooman spoke highly of Waldschmidt's directing, and Kooman praised Waldschmidt's work as scenic designer. Waldschmidt praised the cast's acting. He said he found the play's opening scene, in which a rape occurs, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> stage, despite having previously performed a similar rape scene as an actor. The premiere of She Has a Name was produced by Burnt Thicket Theatre in partnership with Raise Their Voice. The office of Joy Smith, MP for Kildonan—St. Paul, released a statement advertising the premiere of She Has a Name.|$|E
