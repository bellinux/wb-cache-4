5|$|Even before Diarmait's demise, the Uí Chennselaig {{began to}} fight amongst {{themselves}} in a struggle <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> certainly an after-effect of Diarmait's sons' untimely deaths. Specifically, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters, and the eleventhfourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen reveal that Domnall battled {{against the forces of}} his own first cousin once removed, Donnchad mac Domnaill Remair (died 1089), before Diarmait's ally, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1086), was able to intervene and restore order in the Kingdom of Leinster.|$|E
5|$|Advertising for the {{permanent}} reintroduction of Chicken Fries in early 2015 was again shaped {{around a large}} digital-media push headed by its new advertising firm David. However, unlike the 2014 promotion <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> exclusively digitally-oriented, the 2015 promotion was accompanied with a sizable television and media tie-in to the annual NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship tournament. In the host city of Indianapolis, Burger King sponsored Chicken Fries-branded SUVs that would give free rides to visitors. A series of advertisements for the product and the company's 2 for $5 sandwich promotion ran during the tournament featuring the hash tag WatchLikeaKing, along {{with a series of}} NCAA co-branded kid's meals.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} intake, by 1937 there were 201 undergraduates; {{it was a}} uniform {{selection}} <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> completely middle class, {{like the rest of}} the University. Over 60% of entrants came from independent schools, perhaps because of the £250 a year cost of reading towards a degree. It had, unlike some other college, students from several other nations: Muhammad Aslam Khan Khattak and Abbas Khaleeli from British India among them. Students were varied: Baptist Thomas George Cowling became an astronomer and member of the Royal Society, in contrast, Jew Paul Dehn went on to become a film critic and screenwriter. Other alumni of this period include Charles Langbridge Morgan, Edward Atiyah and William Golding.|$|E

5|$|They were unpopular with sportsmen as {{the dark}} colours of the breed {{did not show}} up in hunting conditions, and the {{elongated}} and short shape of the early breed was not very practical for moving easily through cover. The low-slung variety of Field Spaniel were developed by Phineas Bullock from dogs previously owned by Sir Francis Burdett, the secretary of the Birmingham Dog Show. Burdett was said to have owned a variety of black Cocker Spaniels. Bullock crossed the Field Spaniel with the Sussex Spaniel and the English Water Spaniel. In the 1870s he was very successful in the show ring with his variety of Field Spaniel; however, it resulted in a dog <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> exactly like a Sussex Spaniel {{with the exception of the}} head itself.|$|E
5|$|Ice {{hockey is}} {{a sport that}} is contested at the Winter Olympic Games. A men's ice hockey tournament has been held every Winter Olympics (starting in 1924); an ice hockey tournament was also held at the 1920 Summer Olympics. From 1920 to 1968, the Olympics also acted as the Ice Hockey World Championships, and the two events {{occurred}} concurrently. From 1920 until 1984, only amateur athletes were allowed {{to compete in the}} tournament, and players from the National Hockey League (NHL) were not allowed to compete. However, Soviets and Czechoslovakia had state-sponsored teams <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> always on par with the talent coming out of Canada. In 1970, after a disagreement over the definition of amateur players, Canada withdrew from the tournament and did not send a team to the 1972 or 1976 Winter Olympics. In 1987, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to allow professional athletes to compete in the Olympics, and starting in 1998, the NHL allowed its players to participate. Women's ice hockey was added in 1992 and the first tournament was held at the 1998 Winter Olympics. Both events have been held at every Olympic Games since.|$|E
5|$|The Chronicle of Melrose reports Clement's death {{under the}} year 1258. Clement's legacy {{was to be}} remembered as the restorer of the diocese of Dunblane and the builder of its cathedral. Thus for future generations, Clement became the father-figure of the see. Clement was later commemorated as a saint, though there is no record of formal canonisation. He was commemorated on 19 March, meaning <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> {{certainly}} believed to have been the date of his death. Clement's death was also noted by Walter Bower, a Lowland Scottish historian writing in the 1440s, who included the following obituary: Clement bishop of Dunblane died, that outstanding member of the Order of Preachers, a man most eloquent in translating various tongues, powerful in speech and action in the sight of God and of men. He found the cathedral church of his diocese reduced by the neglect of his predecessors to such a state of decay that the divine offices were celebrated in it scarcely three times a week, as if it were some rural chapel. He built it up to be a hallowed sanctuary, enriched it with lands and possessions, and increased its prestige by adding prebends and canonries. Such flattering sentiments had even been expressed during Clement's lifetime. In 1250, the General Chapter of the Dominican Order met in London, and decreed that: we grant to Friar Clement of our Order, a bishop of Scotland, after his death, one mass throughout the Order by every friar whomsoever is a priest. Although there survives a sermon almost certainly written by him, Clement was also credited with being a prolific translator and writing four books (including a hagiography of St Dominic), all of which are now lost.|$|E

5|$|When Charles {{attempted}} to impose his religious policies in Scotland he faced numerous difficulties. Although born in Scotland, Charles had become estranged from his northern kingdom; {{his first visit}} since early childhood was for his Scottish coronation in 1633. To the dismay of the Scots, who had removed many traditional rituals from their liturgical practice, Charles insisted that the coronation be conducted in the Anglican rite. In 1637, the king ordered {{the use of a}} new prayer book in Scotland <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> identical to the English Book of Common Prayer, without consulting either the Scottish Parliament or the Kirk. Although written, under Charles's direction, by Scottish bishops, many Scots resisted it, seeing the new prayer book as a vehicle for introducing Anglicanism to Scotland. On 23 July, riots erupted in Edinburgh upon the first Sunday of the prayer book's usage, and unrest spread throughout the Kirk. The public began to mobilise around a reaffirmation of the National Covenant, whose signatories pledged to uphold the reformed religion of Scotland and reject any innovations that were not authorised by Kirk and Parliament. When the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland met in November 1638, it condemned the new prayer book, abolished episcopal church government by bishops, and adopted Presbyterian government by elders and deacons.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of Japanese immigrants intended to work a few years in Brazil, make some money, and go home. However, “getting rich quick” was a dream <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> impossible to achieve. The immigrants were paid a very low salary and worked long hours of exhausting work. Also, everything that the immigrants consumed had to be purchased from the landowner (see truck system). Soon, their debts became very high.|$|E

25|$|Amid the {{emergence}} of increasingly virulent and hostile sectional ideologies in national politics, {{the collapse of the}} old Second Party System in the 1850s hampered politicians' efforts to reach yet another compromise.

25|$|The party still {{failed to}} present a true {{challenge}} to the Liberal government, since its agenda was seen as too extreme for the liking {{of central and eastern}} Canada.

However, due to massive vote splitting with the PCs, this support only translated into one seat in Ontario during its 1993 breakthrough--the only seat that the party ever won east of Manitoba.

25|$|German {{defenders}} repulsed two division {{attacks in}} the most violent fighting {{in the history of}} the division, during 8 to 10 January and 16 to 17 January 1945.

Poor tactics were compounded by terrain <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> tabletop-flat, offering the German defenders excellent fields of fire. However, enemy counterattacks failed also, in part because of the firm leadership of the commander of Combat Command B, Colonel Charles Bromley, who declared his headquarters expendable and ordered all personnel in the headquarters to prepare a hasty defense.|$|E

Uncooperative indigenous peoples, who had forced the Spanish to leave Valdivia in 1604 contributed to get the expedition to leave after some months of occupation. This occupation triggered the return of the Spanish to Valdivia and the building of one of the largest defensive complexes of colonial America.|$|E

Like that shock, the 2010 Damghan event took place in a rural area that exposed relatively few villages to strong shaking. It occurred at 11:53 local time in the north-central desert region of Iran on a fault that dipped 78° to the northwest. Fault motion occurred on a NE-SW striking fault <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> pure left-lateral strike-slip. A Mercalli intensity of VII (Very strong) was observed in Kuh Zar and the nearby villages of Tuchahi, Kelu, and Shimi. In Hoseynian, Moalleman, Satveh, and Torud, the intensity was VI (Strong). Some surface cracks and fissures were present near Tuchahi and Kelu villages, but no significant surface faulting occurred.|$|E
25|$|Iran, {{the state}} in which the {{movement}} of establishing the new Sasanian government began, had lost its fame by third century A.D. Since old times, a new city named Istakhr had risen beside the ruins of Takht-e Jamshid, an Achaemenid capital which was burnt by troops of Alexander III of Macedon.

They considered the Parthians primordial usurpers who had taken the formers' right by force.|$|E
