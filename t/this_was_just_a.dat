5|$|The {{passage of}} the Mayflower across the North Atlantic lasted more than two months, with 102 {{passengers}} crowded onto the cargo ship's gun deck and about 30 crew members. The seas were not severe during {{the first month of}} the voyage but, by the second month, the ship was being hit by strong autumn gales, causing it to be badly shaken with water leaks from structural damage. There were two deaths, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> precursor to what happened after their Cape Cod arrival, when almost half the company died in the first winter.|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships were}} laid down on 16 June 1909, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> {{ceremonial}} event as actual work {{did not begin}} until September–October. One major complication was that the design for the turrets and their magazines was not completed when construction began so their weights and dimensions had to be estimated. The machinery for these ships was built by either the Baltic Works or the Franco-Russian Works as the New Admiralty Shipyard lacked its own engine shop. Construction was initially very slow because the Duma did not allocate any money for these ships until May 1911. Initial funding was taken from other budget items or the emperor's discretionary fund and the shipyards had {{to use their own}} money to keep the work going. They were enormously expensive with their cost estimated at 29.4 million rubles each, including armament. By way of comparison the preceding class of pre-dreadnoughts had only cost 11 million rubles each. Once the Duma provided the funding the pace of work accelerated and the ships were launched later that year, although delays in the delivery of engines and turrets hindered their completion. All of the ships completed abbreviated trials by the end of 1914 and reached the fleet in December 1914 – January 1915.|$|E

25|$|Resistance {{against the}} German {{occupiers}} of Belgium {{can be seen}} at all levels and from all quarters of the political spectrum, but was highly fragmented. The Government in Exile dealt with resistance collectively under the name Armée Secrète, however <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> broad name for the many resistance organisations which existed. Some organisations were very left-wing, like the Communist Front de l'Indépendance, {{but there was also a}} far-right resistance movement, the Légion Belge which comprised dissident Rexists. However, there were also other groups like Groupe G which had no obvious political affiliation.|$|E
25|$|Bell's budget {{shows that}} the city was {{generating}} increased income from fees and taxes over several years. Bell's records show that the city made nearly a million dollars just in impound fees in fiscal year 2008-09, which works out to be about $10 per citizen in this small town. Bell was charging $300 for unlicensed motorists to recover their cars, three times what Los Angeles County and neighboring cities charge."All of <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> means by Rizzo to nickel and dime the community to death to get more money out of them", Christina Garcia, a community activist, said.|$|E

25|$|On 8 December 1941 the Japanese 25th Army {{under the}} command of Lieutenant-General Tomoyuki Yamashita {{launched}} an amphibious assault on the Malay Peninsula (one hour before the attack on Pearl Harbor; the difference in date was because the two places lie {{on opposite sides of the}} international date line). That night the first Japanese invasion force arrived at Kota Bharu on Malaya's east coast. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> diversionary force, and the main landings took place the next day at Singora and Pattani on the south-eastern coast of Thailand, with troops rapidly deploying over the border into northern Malaya.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 5–6 November, the Marines drove off two {{preliminary}} attacks from the Japanese 23rd Infantry Regiment. Colonel Edward A. Craig, commander of the 9th Marines to which 2nd Raider Battalion was attached, surmised that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> preparatory action and brought up more Raiders to reinforce the roadblock. When the Japanese attacked the following afternoon (7 November), the Marines were ready and drove the Japanese back to Piva village. Early {{on the morning of}} 8 November, Major General Shun Iwasa, commander of the Japanese 6th Division's infantry group (the Iwasa Detachment), renewed the attack with two full battalions. The Americans brought up men of the 3rd Raider Battalion to protect the flanks of the Marines already engaged, as well as some light tanks. Frontal attacks by the Japanese were repulsed.|$|E

500|$|The Incredibles as {{a concept}} dates back to 1993 when Bird sketched the family during {{a period in which}} he tried to break into film. Personal issues had percolated into the story as they weighed on him in life. During this time, Bird had inked a {{production}} deal with Warner Bros. Animation and {{was in the process of}} directing his first feature, The Iron Giant. Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking, Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life. He stated, [...] "Consciously, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> funny movie about superheroes. But I think that what was going on in my life definitely filtered into the movie." [...] After the box office failure of The Iron Giant, Bird gravitated toward his superhero story.|$|E
500|$|In {{a session}} of Prime Minister's Questions some weeks later, David Cameron {{challenged}} Brown to concede on record that [...] "no deals were done" [...] in ensuring {{the bill was}} passed. Brown stood before the House and said, [...] "yes". Cameron quoted from a letter written by Labour's Chief Whip Geoff Hoon to Keith Vazthe Chairman of the Home Affairs Committeein which Hoon expressed deep thanks for Vaz's support and closed the letter with the line, [...] "I trust {{that you will be}} appropriately rewarded". Hoon said that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> joke between friends but others, such as Conservative leader David Cameron and Shadow Home Secretary David Davis viewed this letter as proof that deals were indeed done behind the scenes and that Brown lied on the record when he said there had been none. The House of Lords defeated the bill, which Lords said was [...] "fatally flawed, ill thought through and unnecessary", stating that [...] "it seeks to further erode...fundamental legal and civil rights".|$|E
500|$|A Canadian reprint edition, with {{identical}} {{contents and}} dates, began in February 1948, from All Fiction Field, Inc.; in October 1951 the publisher became Popular Publications, Toronto, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> name change {{rather than a}} change of ownership. [...] The final Canadian issue was dated August 1952; these issues were half an inch longer than the U.S. versions. [...] In addition, the Canadian edition of Super Science Stories, which had initially reprinted from its U.S. namesake and from the U.S. edition of Astonishing Stories, began to reprint almost entirely from Famous Fantastic Mysteries beginning with the August 1944 Canadian issue. [...] As {{a nod to the}} change in source material, the title of the Canadian edition was changed to Super Science and Fantastic Stories starting with the December 1944 issue. [...] A Mexican magazine, Los Cuentos Fantasticos, which published 44 issues between 1948 and 1953, reprinted stories from both Famous Fantastic Mysteries and Astounding Science Fiction, mostly (though not entirely) without obtaining permission first.|$|E

500|$|Ian McDiarmid {{required}} little make-up in The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. He recalled, [...] "I'm ... slightly aged [...] In {{the last}} film, I had a fairly standard make-up on, but now, they're starting to crinkle my face." [...] Transforming McDiarmid into Emperor Palpatine in Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith, however, required extensive make-up. McDiarmid remarked {{in an interview}} with Star Wars Insider magazine, [...] "Yes—that was a four-hour job, initially, although we got it down to about two-and-a-half in the end. But <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> little bit of latex here and there, a little bit of skin-scrunching." [...] He told the Homing Beacon newsletter, [...] "When my face changes in the film, my mind went back to the early silent movie of The Phantom of the Opera with Lon Chaney, Sr.." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert wrote that he [...] "looks uncannily like Death in The Seventh Seal" [...] (1957) and film historian Robin Wood compares him to the hag from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937).|$|E
500|$|Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya {{was built}} by the ONZiV Shipyard at Nikolayev. She was laid down on 30 October 1911 as Ekaterina II, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> {{ceremonial}} event as the design {{had not yet been}} finalized or the contract signed. ONZiV decided, on advice from Vickers, to increase her dimensions over those of her sisters to prevent her from being overweight. This added over two million gold rubles to her cost and delayed the start of her construction three months past her sisters. She suffered from a number of other delays during construction. First the method of fastening the armor to its supports was changed and the armor plates were locked together by a type of mortise and tenon joint to better distribute the shock of an impact. This was based on the full-scale armor trials conducted using the hulk of the old pre-dreadnought battleship [...] in 1913 and added almost [...] of weight to the ship. She was launched on 6 June 1914, renamed on 27 June 1915, and completed on 18 October 1915. She ran her trials during the remainder of the year.|$|E
500|$|All three {{ships were}} laid down on 30 October 1911, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> {{ceremonial}} event as the design {{had not yet}} been finalized nor the contracts signed. A contract was finally signed on 13 April 1912 with Russud that specified delivery dates of 2 September 1915 for both Imperatritsa Mariya and Imperator Aleksander III. Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya was built to a larger design that added over two million gold rubles to her cost and delayed the start of her construction three months after her half-sisters. Despite the demanding schedule the ships suffered from a number of delays during construction. On 10 February 1914 changes were ordered by the Naval Ministry to incorporate the lessons learned from the full-scale armor trials conducted using the Chesma. This added almost [...] of weight to the ships and raised their cost by 220,000–250,000 rubles. Other delays were incurred after the war began as imported components took longer to reach the shipyards and factories switched over to war production. The construction of Imperator Aleksander III was deliberately delayed in order to accelerate the completion of her two sisters and some of her turrets were transferred to Imperatritsa Mariya as well.|$|E

Then her priority was reduced after the start of World War I to concentrate efforts on her more advanced sister ships to complete them more quickly. She was not expected to be finished before 1916, but her British-built turbines were also delayed. Imperator Aleksandr III was launched on 15 April 1914, but did not arrive at Sevastopol for fitting out until 17 July 1917, by which time the ship had been renamed Volia (Freedom). She conducted her sea trials over the next several months. By this time the Black Sea Fleet was totally ineffective {{as a result of the}} political situation after the February Revolution and Volia did not see any combat.|$|E
