30|$|In {{the context}} of {{site-specific}} management, forest-productivity maps are a useful resource to quantify and qualify variations across forested areas.

40|$|The {{status and}} {{prospects}} of urban trees in Hong Kong are evaluated with information gathered from questionnaires and a <b>tree</b> <b>survey.</b> Planting and maintenance responsibilities fall to four government departments plus the private sector. Species composition is unevenly distributed, with five popular species constituting {{over half of}} the trees sampled. The numbers of introduced and cultivated trees far exceed those of native and voluntary ones. Species-selection without an evaluation programme is generally conservative, but gradual shifts in preference are discernible. The multifarious physical constraints in both the above-ground and subterranean environments that pose stringent limits on the number of potential planting sites and the growth of existing trees are elaborated. Typhoons, which could periodically cause widespread damage, often regardless of species and location, could only be partially mitigated by more comprehensive preventive measures. Pests and diseases which have not received detailed study are apparently mild. Vandalism, which damages roughly 10 - 15 % of trees planted, could be alleviated by planting more heavy standard trees, but their supply is limited because of inadequate nursery space. The chronic shortage of tree staff aggravated by a high job mobility, due mainly to comparatively low remuneration and poor promotion prospects, creates a bottleneck in the tree programme. For the future, a city-wide <b>tree</b> <b>survey</b> together with a computer database are essential for efficient management, maintenance and research. The existing, rather lax statutory control should be consolidated and tightened, with authority being given to a single department which should be adequately supported by supervisory staff. Land could be zoned specifically, like other land-uses, for tree planting, and this could be more generous and spatially more evenly distributed to allow penetration of greenery into wider parts of the city. The potential in urban renewal areas where land could be released and reserved for planting should be realized as far as possible. Overall, rising aspirations for better environmental quality could be achieved by a combination of high-density vertical developments and strategically situated open spaces liberally adorned by landscape planting. © 1987. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

This thesis {{is divided into two}} topics focused on the use of freely available geospatial data to improve natural {{resource management}}. For the first topic, freely available street level imagery and benefits modeling software are utilized to conduct a virtual street <b>tree</b> <b>survey.</b> This new methodology has the potential to provide time effective and inexpensive access to benefits modeling while still providing a baseline understanding of associated street tree benefits. This study produced results that were statistically similar on a tree by tree basis between field and virtual surveys, but had lower modeled benefits due to underestimation of tree diameters in the virtual survey. In the second topic, wetlands detection was explored using freely available high resolution data products. LiDAR (light detection and ranging) and NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) imagery were utilized to create two different products which may aid in wetlands detection. The first product used NAIP aerial photographs to separate pixels which had high probability of being vegetation based on their spectral reflectance in red and infrared, and combined these with LiDAR to show the heights of the vegetative surfaces. The second product utilized LiDAR data to generate contour lines and locate concentric depression centers that may be indicative of wetlands. While these products may not specifically identify wetland areas, they may be helpful for focusing conservation efforts. Thesis (M. S. ...|$|E
40|$|As {{urbanisation}} {{continues to}} fragment and degrade habitats {{there is a}} need to ensure that cities are managed to sustain ecosystem function and high biodiversity. Ecological theories suggest that areas with higher levels of functional connectivity sustain a more diverse avian population. By identifying the key habitat features that dictate the distribution and abundance of avian populations it is possible to inform planning policy to maximise biodiversity. Bird species presence and abundance across an urban gradient in Birmingham (UK) was surveyed at 70 sites over three sampling periods (between 2009 and 2010), in combination with a <b>tree</b> <b>survey</b> and digital analysis of land use. Functional connectivity was shown to increase the abundance of bird species and to ameliorate the impacts of urban development. Bird species were found to vary with their associations with vegetation structure and a proxy for invertebrate productivity. There was clear evidence for increasing native tree species in the urban matrix to support more bird species. Ringing data collected between 2008 and 2011 were used to examine bird movements through the city and the influence of habitat factors such as connectivity and built space in the matrix. Bird movements between ringing sites demonstrated the permeability of the city and the importance of connectivity in the landscape. This work showed that the composition of the matrix influences bird occupancy and turnover of sites. The novel findings presented in this thesis on the influence of the urban landscape on urban avian ecology should make an important contribution to urban conservation methods...|$|E
40|$|Forest {{composed}} of many trees {{has an important}} role in maintaining environmental conditions suitable for life on the earth. There are many research which incorporate <b>tree</b> <b>survey</b> data into geographical information system, but those are not represented individual tree objects. A {{purpose of this study is}} to build the three dimensional forest map of individual tree level, by fusion of field measured data, satellite image, and omni-directional fish-eye photos. First, to obtain the field measured data, we have collected several kind of tree data in the test site. This area is 140 meter from west to east and 60 meter from north to south. In this site, the grid of 10 meter mesh is constructed using piles labeled alphabet and numeric characters. In this study, about 100 trees with height of 16 to 18 meter were selected in order to measure. The measured data are the tree stand locations, the eight distances between the tree trunk and outermost branches in eight directions, and the diameter at breast height. Second, we create the three dimensional forest space using OpenGL graphics library. By using the field measured data, each octagonal crown object which has the location and outermost shape of individual tree is created. The method of image-to-map rectification to identify tree crown from satellite image is performed for registration of high corresponding. The each registered region in IKONOS satellite image is rendering on the corresponding crown object. Next, using omni-directional fish-eye photos taken at the four viewpoints on the corners of the each grid, the rectangle trunk objects of four different directions are created. Finally, it became possible to visualize the three dimensional forest map of individual tree objects with attribute data. By using omni-directional fish-eye photos taken at different seasons, it is possible to show seasonal change of individual tree in forest. This system is useful for forest management and monitoring. ...|$|E

Design constraints are as follows: environmental, economic, building codes, AASHTO Guide Specifications for Design of Pedestrian Bridges, site access restrictions, constructibility, and client criteria. The procedure used to site the bridge is presented along with relevant codes, and procedures involved including an abbreviated McHarg Method for Site Inventory and Analysis and large <b>tree</b> <b>survey</b> of the area. A discussion of pedestrian bridge solutions and considerations is also provided. This paper offers a discussion of cables, cable behavior, analysis and design procedures before presenting the reader {{with a description of}} the bridge design and discussion. The bridge design presented herein is a two-span cable truss solution, which is a common structural system employed in long span roofs but is rarely used in pedestrian bridge design. The primary reasons for its use here are its small and light structural members, ease of constructibility, and lightness of fonn. A handrail system composed of cable components, glass fiber reinforced polymer decking, and small steel W-section joists add to the structure's small dead weight. Tensioning the primary cables during construction provides the stiffness of the cable structure. This cable tension requires anchorages at either end that can carry a tensile load into the ground. This tensile load is resisted by a total of 24 rock anchors at each end. The central pier of the bridge is a portal frame composed of large W-sections, the heaviest components in the bridge. The foundation of this central pier consists of a simple spread footing designed against overturning and bearing failure. Finally, structural drawings of the bridge are provided in Appendix A and design calculations are provided in subsequent appendices...|$|E
40|$|Urban {{surfaces}} are usually net sources of CO 2. Vegetation can potentially {{have an important}} role in reducing the CO 2 emitted by anthropogenic activities in cities, particularly when vegetation is extensive and/or evergreen. A direct and accurate estimation of carbon uptake by urban vegetation is difficult due to the particular characteristics of the urban ecosystem and high variability in tree distribution and species. Here, we investigate the role of urban vegetation in the CO 2 flux from a residential neighbourhood in Singapore using two different approaches. CO 2 fluxes measured directly by eddy covariance are compared with emissions estimated from emissions factors and activity data. The latter includes contributions from vehicular traffic, household combustion, soil respiration and human breathing. The difference between estimated emissions and measured fluxes should approximate the flux associated with the aboveground vegetation. In addition, a <b>tree</b> <b>survey</b> was conducted to estimate the annual CO 2 sequestration using allometric equations and an alternative model of the metabolic theory of ecology for tropical forests. Palm trees, banana plants and turfgrass were also included in the survey with their annual CO 2 uptake obtained from published growth rates. Both approaches agree within 2 % and suggest that vegetation sequesters 8 % of the total emitted CO 2 in the residential neighbourhood studied. An uptake of 1. 4 ton km − 2 day − 1 (510 ton km − 2 yr − 1) was estimated as the difference between assimilation by photosynthesis minus the aboveground biomass respiration during daytime (4. 0 ton km − 2 day − 1) and release by plant respiration at night (2. 6 ton km − 2 day − 1). However, when soil respiration is added to the daily aboveground flux, the biogenic component becomes a net source amounting to 4 % of the total CO 2 flux and represents the total contribution of urban vegetation to the carbon flux to the atmosphere...|$|E
30|$|A {{necessity}} for yielding unbiased estimates when applying propensity score matching is a thoroughly considered model based {{on which the}} propensity scores are estimated (see Shadish and Steiner [2010]; Bryson et al. [2002]; Smith and Todd [2005])f. Since the <b>TREE</b> <b>survey</b> has been designed {{particularly with respect to}} the investigation of school-to-work transitions, it offers a rich source of data to estimate the propensity scores and balance samples. The following variables are included in the estimation of propensity scores based on which we then match a control group: We include social categories such as gender (coding is 1 [*]=[*]male and 0 [*]=[*]female) and migrant status modelled in terms of the language spoken at home (coding is 1 [*]=[*]national language vs. 0 [*]=[*]foreign language) as well as the country of birth (coding is 1 [*]=[*]Switzerland, Luxembourg vs. 0 [*]=[*]other country). As educational qualifications further {{play an important role in}} terms of labour market integration and future job prospects we include measures of competencies (PISA literacy scores and mark in math) and the type of track at lower secondary education (coding is 1 [*]=[*]basic requirements, 2 [*]=[*]extended requirements/pre-gym and 3 [*]=[*]no formal tracking). As vocational education and training should not be seen as a uniform level track in Switzerland (Stalder [2011]), the level of vocational education and training is furthermore taken into account (coding is 1 [*]=[*]low-skill VET, 2 [*]=[*]medium-skill VET, 3 [*]=[*]high-skill VET and 4 [*]=[*]vocational maturity). The coding of the level of demand of the vocational education is based on a coding scheme proposed by Stalder ([2011]). As a successful transition and career advancement are also influenced by family background (see e.g., Buchmann [2011]; Neuenschwander and Kracke [2011]) we include socio-economic status (Isei), familial possessions of poetry literature (coding is 1 [*]=[*]poetry at home vs. 0 [*]=[*]no poetry at home), a PISA index for social communication within the family (Soccom), family structure (coding is 0 [*]=[*]nuclear family, 1 [*]=[*]single parent and 2 [*]=[*]mixed/other) and the number of siblings (coding is 0 [*]=[*]no siblings, 1 [*]=[*]one sibling, 2 [*]=[*]two siblings and 3 [*]=[*]three or more siblings). Important individual resources that determine labour market integration of the young (see Rüfenacht and Neuenschwander [2013]; Neuenschwander [2012]; Neuenschwander and Kracke [2011]; Gerber-Schenk et al. [2010]) are also taken into account by the inclusion of measures for self-efficacy, persistency and a positive attitude towards life (measured prior to labour market entry in order to avoid bias due to reversed causality). The dummy-variables are coded 1 if the individual resource is available vs. 0 if it is not. Attendance and punctuality are important behavioural resources with regard to a successful entry into an apprenticeship (see Hupka et al. [2006]) and thus they may also be regarded as indicators for transitional outcomes and success in later work life. Therefore we include measures for behaviour at lower secondary level such as skipping classes (coding is 1 [*]=[*]yes vs. 0 [*]=[*]no) and finishing homework on time (coding is 1 [*]=[*]yes vs. 0 [*]=[*]no) in the estimation of propensity scores. As the demand for newcomers varies according to the field trained in (see Sacchi and Salvisberg [2012]), we also include measures for the field of vocational education and training. The classification of educational fields is based on an international ISCED-coding scheme proposed by Andersson and Olsson ([1999]). Overall, different traditions concerning the orientation of educational systems across linguistic regions in Switzerland exist (Seibert et al. [2009]; Meyer [2009]). Thus, we further include the region of residence (coding is 1 [*]=[*]German speaking part, 2 [*]=[*]French speaking part and 3 [*]=[*]Italian speaking part) as well as average cantonal youth unemployment rates between 2003 – 2007, which is for the main entry period we look at.|$|E
40|$|During summer 1996 / 97, a Pinus radiata D. Don {{plantation}} (9000 ha) near Whangamata, New Zealand, was sampled {{to assess}} how intensity and distribution of brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula Kerr) damage were related to stand maturity. Based on a review of previous surveys, a new damage-scoring system was developed. Using this system, the overall proportion of pine trees greater than 3 years of age with possum damage {{was found to be}} very low (3. 6 % of 1244 <b>trees</b> <b>surveyed)</b> despite possums being present in substantial numbers (mean catch of 28. 1 possums per 100 trapnights; range 12. 0 - 54. 9). Damage levels varied markedly (0 %- 30 %) between 36 plantation blocks. The majority of possum damage involved needle clipping and damage to lateral branches. All damage types showed negative correlations with tree maturity. Given the low damage levels recorded, the cost-effectiveness of current possum-control efforts in pine plantations of this type is uncertain and would benefit from further economic analysis...|$|R
40|$|Picea rubens (red spruce) and P. mariana (black spruce) {{are closely}} related species which are {{difficult}} to differentiate morphologically. They are sympatric with P. glauca (white spruce) in the northern portion of their ranges. In order to identify potential interspecific polymorphisms, the chloroplast trnK intron and rpl 33 -psaJ-trnP region were sequenced, and the nuclear-encoded ITS region of the rDNA repeat was partially sequenced. Thirteen chloroplast and 12 nuclear candidate interspecific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. The species-specificity of several SNPs was determined by surveying DNAs amplified from trees representing range-wide provenance tests; these included 46 red spruce from 11 provenances, 84 black spruce from 30 provenances and 90 white spruce from 22 provenances. Two SNPs (1 chloroplast and 1 nuclear), which distinguish black spruce from red and white spruce, were consistent among 96 – 100 % of the <b>trees</b> <b>surveyed.</b> Five SNPs (4 chloroplast and 1 nuclear), which distinguish white spruce from red and black spruce, were consistent among 100 % of <b>surveyed</b> <b>trees.</b> These species-specific SNPs were used to identify anonymous spruce samples in a blind test, and their utility for small amounts of tissue, as little as single needles, was demonstrated. Scoring these SNPs is much less labor intensive than previous molecular methods for taxa differentiation (restriction fragment length polymorphisms or random amplified polymorphic DNAs), therefore they {{can be applied to}} large population studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{invasive}} rust Puccinia psidii (myrtle rust) {{was detected}} in Australia in 2010 {{and is now}} established along the east coast from southern New South Wales to far north Queensland. Prior to reaching Australia, severe damage from P. psidii was mainly restricted to exotic eucalypt plantations in South America, guava plantations in Brazil, allspice plantations in Jamaica, and exotic Myrtaceous tree species in the USA; the only previous record of widespread damage in native environments is of endangered Eugenia koolauensis in Hawai’i. Using two rainforest tree species as indicators {{of the impact of}} P. psidii, we report for the first time severe damage to endemic Myrtaceae in native forests in Australia, after only 4 years’ exposure to P. psidii. A 3 -year disease exclusion trial in a natural stand of Rhodamnia rubescens unequivocally showed that repeated, severe infection leads to gradual crown loss and ultimately tree mortality; trees were killed in less than 4 years. Significant (p < 0. 001) correlations were found between both incidence (r = 0. 36) and severity (r = 0. 38) of P. psidii and subsequent crown loss (crown transparency). This provided supporting evidence to conclude a causal association between P. psidii and crown loss and tree mortality in our field assessments of R. rubescens and Rhodomyrtus psidioides across their native range. Assessments revealed high levels of damage by P. psidii to immature leaves, shoots and tree crowns—averaging 76 % (R. rubescens) and 95 % (R. psidioides) crown transparency—as well as tree mortality. For R. psidioides, we saw exceptionally high levels of tree mortality, with over half the <b>trees</b> <b>surveyed</b> dead and 40 % of stands with greater than 50 % tree mortality, including two stands where all trees were dead. Tree mortality was less prevalent for R. rubescens, with only 12 % of <b>trees</b> <b>surveyed</b> dead and two sites with greater than 50 % mortality. Any alternative causal agents for this tree mortality have been discounted. The ecological implications of this are unclear, but our work clearly illustrates the potential for P. psidii to negatively affect Australia’s biodiversity. © 2015 The Author(s...|$|R
