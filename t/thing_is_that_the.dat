5|$|One {{aspect of}} the Carolinian method of {{estimating}} longitude on inter-island sailings is to visualize the target island relative to a second reference island's alignment with a succession of selected stars, points of the star compass. It is a refined system of dead reckoning whereby the navigator constantly synthesizes his position relative to the reference island's location in his mental model. The most remarkable <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reference island (lu pongank) may be over the horizon, unseen, even imaginary.|$|E
5|$|With {{the opening}} of the New York – Pennsylvania Joint Bridge Commission, a {{predecessor}} of the current Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, in the 1920s to buy out these bridges from private ownership, the tolls along the bridges of the Delaware were beginning to come to an end. The Commission offered the Bridge Company an offer of $19,542.22 (1920s USD). The company took the offer and under new ownership, the tolls were eliminated. The bridge had more activity after the elimination of tolls and business continued to prosper. With the new owners, the bridge was kept under routine maintenance, and the bridge has continued to maintain a strong structure. Even with the floods from Hurricanes Connie and Diane of 1955 and the 1960s, the bridge survived with little to no structural damage. From May to October 1986, the commission closed the bridge to do some renovations. The wooden deck was replaced, the entire bridge was painted, and new guide rails were constructed. The only <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 3 ton (6000lb) weight limit remained after the revamping. On November 14, 1988, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

25|$|Appeal in {{a cartoon}} {{character}} corresponds {{to what would}} be called charisma in an actor. A character who is appealing is not necessarily sympathetic – villains or monsters can also be appealing – the important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> viewer feels the character is real and interesting. There are several tricks for making a character connect better with the audience; for likable characters a symmetrical or particularly baby-like face tends to be effective. A complicated or hard to read face will lack appeal, it may more accurately be described as 'captivation' {{in the composition of}} the pose, or the character design.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there was}} a lot of {{damaging}} effects to having the Europeans settle in the highlands, there were a lot of positive things that came out of this. One of <b>the</b> positive <b>things</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Europeans discovered copper in the bioregion which later became a place for cooper mining. They also found gold, silver, antimony and zinc which really helped their economy going. Miners who would mine in the area would grow crops such as apple, cherry and plum trees.

Although Ginsburg has consistently supported abortion rights and joined in the Court's opinion striking down Nebraska's partial-birth abortion law in Stenberg v.

Wade , she criticized the decision in Roe as terminating a nascent democratic movement to liberalize abortion laws which might have built a more durable consensus in support of abortion rights.|$|E

[...] Springsteen fans instantly discussed and analyzed setlists as shows happened on the Backstreets.com BTX website, associated with which Twitter and other sources were used to post, {{or in some cases}} crudely broadcast, shows as they happened. [...] E Street bassist Garry Tallent and guitarist Nils Lofgren found themselves amused that fans had complained on the previous Magic Tour of too much new material being played, and were now complaining of too little.

This episode is nearly everything a Fringe fan could have asked for... Besides the awesomeness with the Bishops, Olivia finally returns to taking an active role in an episode... But the most important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> overarching Fringe plot finally progressed, and it's going in a pretty damn good direction". Jane Boursaw from TV Squad enjoyed the episode because it had a [...] "few reveals and a nice cliffhanger." [...] She liked the interactions between Walter and Peter, and also praised the scene between Olivia and Newton. Josh Wigler of MTV was pleased that the [...] "mystery of the week" [...] also tied into the ongoing plot, and that answers were provided to certain mysteries, such as why Walter's behavior and personality is [...] "a little...off.

The op art graphics and laughable opening theme are delightfully retro now. The most important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> characters are genuinely likeable and their motivations fathomable." [...] Sevakis praised the story as having [...] "purity", as [...] "There are no manufactured obstacles to overcome." [...] He also declared, [...] "Despite being Western-looking and ostensibly about universally accessible sport of tennis, it's a fascinating look at Japanese personal motivation, interaction and decorum," [...] playing [...] "like a catalog of Japan's most interesting cultural quirks." [...] Art-wise it was compared to Dear Brother and The Rose of Versailles by Anime News Network's Lynzee Lamb, who said it [...] "reinforces {{a lot of the}} dangerous work ethic that permeates sports series, like battling through a serious injury or abandoning emotional 'dalliances' like romance." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the shooting, Democrats and Republicans both called for a cooling of {{political}} rhetoric and a return to bipartisanship. On the eve of the shooting, Giffords had written to a Republican friend, Trey Grayson, Secretary of State of Kentucky, saying, [...] "we need {{to figure out how to}} tone our rhetoric and partisanship down." [...] In March 2010, Giffords had expressed concern about the use of crosshairs on a national midterm election map on Sarah Palin's campaign webpage denoting targeted congressional seats, including Giffords's, in Arizona's 8th district. Shortly after the map's posting and the subsequent vandalizing of her office that month, Giffords said, [...] "We're in Sarah Palin's 'targeted' list, but the <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> way she has it depicted, we're in the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they've got to realize that there are consequences to that action." [...] At that point in the interview, however, the interviewer said, [...] "campaign rhetoric and war rhetoric have been interchangeable for years." [...] The image was removed from Palin's [...] "takebackthe20" [...] website following the January shootings. Palin responded to her critics in a January 12 video, rejecting the notion that anyone other than the gunman could bear any responsibility for the Tucson shooting, and accusing the press of manufacturing a [...] "blood libel" [...] to blame her and the right wing for the attacks.|$|E

Ultimately, the most important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> audience remain removed from the show by three or four decades. You can't do what Paramount did and update it and make the language modern. The whole thing doesn't make sense, because the tonal idiom doesn't play in the modern world.

25|$|Just {{after the}} station of Bolzano the track {{branched}} {{off from the}} Brennerbahn and ran along the Eisack river.

After a long bridge over the Adige river, the line got steeper and after two short tunnels reached the Überetsch plateau. Here the trains only stopped in Eppan, Kaltern and Sankt Anton, near the Mendel Funicular station. <b>The</b> strange <b>thing</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> track to the Sankt Anton station left the mainline before it arrived to the Kaltern station, so the trains had to run to Kaltern station, drive back to the switch, change driving direction again and then go further to the Sankt Anton station.|$|R

[...] However, a Disney spokesperson later told Time <b>that</b> DiSalvo's quote <b>was</b> widely misinterpreted, stating <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> [...] "describing some technical aspects of CG animation and not making a general comment on animating females versus males or other characters."

In an August 2014 interview, DiSalvo re-emphasized what he had been trying to explain all along when his statements were taken out of context– the difficulty with turning any kind of animated character from a series of sketches on a 2D emotion model sheet into a properly rigged 3D character model: [...] "Translating that emotional range onto a CG character {{is one of the most}} difficult parts of the process.
