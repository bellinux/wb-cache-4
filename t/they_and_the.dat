5|$|At the September 11 Battle of Brandywine, the 4th Virginia Brigade stubbornly {{resisted}} {{the advance of}} General Charles Cornwallis, but was ultimately forced to retreat. Following the British victory, Howe marched toward Philadelphia, stopping briefly at Germantown. Scott persistently advocated for an attack on Howe's position at Germantown, and although he was initially in the minority among Washington's generals, he ultimately prevailed upon Washington to conduct the attack. On October 4, 1777, the 4th Virginia attacked the British in the Battle of Germantown. Because of their circuitous route to the battle, however, the field was already covered by heavy smoke from muskets and a fire set by the British in a dry buckwheat field when they arrived; eventually, <b>they</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other colonial forces {{were lost in the}} smoke and retreated.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{started in}} March 2008, and later {{finished}} on August {{in the same}} year. Before principal photography commenced, director Colm McCarthy participated in helicopter shots over London. In each block of episodes, {{the cast and crew}} would often film all scenes held in certain locations at once, for instance all scenes set on the Grid, although taking place in different parts of each episodes, would all be filmed together before moving on to another set. However, the cast had trouble following the storylines with this method. A different Director of Photography was hired in each episode. Because of this, the filming style inside the Grid set changed in every episode. To film public shots, a small filming crew were used as to not attract too much attention from passers by. However, by using the small crew, <b>they</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> actors generally film the scenes unnoticed by the public, which the producers felt gave the characters such gravitas.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 1840, that the Salukis were first brought to England. Referred to as Slughis, <b>they</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> modern Sloughi were treated as the same breed; however, recent genetic tests {{have shown that the}} two breeds are genetically separate. The first {{successful}} modern breeding line of Salukis began in 1895, with Florence Amherst (daughter of the 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney). Having seen Salukis on a Nile tour in that year, she imported a breeding pair from the Al Salihah area of Lower Egypt. A champion of breed purity, she struggled alone for nearly three decades, and real Saluki popularity did not take hold until the early 1920s, when officers returning from the war in the Middle East and the Arab Revolt brought their pet Salukis home with them.|$|E

5|$|Scientific jury selection, often {{abbreviated}} SJS, {{is the use}} {{of social}} science techniques and expertise to choose favorable juries during a criminal or civil trial.

It almost always entails an expert's assistance in the attorney's use of peremptory challenges—the right to reject a certain number of potential jurors without stating a reason—during jury selection.

5|$|The Ustaše {{gathered}} {{them in a}} field alongside 5,000 other Chetnik {{prisoners and}} arranged for Drljević and his followers to select 150 Chetnik officers and non-combatant intellectuals for execution. Đurišić, Baćović, Vasić and Ostojić were amongst those selected. <b>They</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> others were loaded onto boats by the Ustaše and taken across the Sava River, where they were killed either in the Jasenovac concentration camp itself or in a nearby marsh. Both the NDH forces and Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić. The NDH forces were motivated by the mass terror committed by Đurišić on the Muslim population in Sandžak and southeastern Bosnia while Drljević was opposed to Đurišić's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro which ran counter to Drljević's separatism. Left without a leader, the majority of Đurišić's men were integrated into Drljević's Montenegrin National Army and withdrew with him towards the Austrian border.|$|E
5|$|The Woolwich Rotunda Artillery Museum and the States of Jersey lent {{examples}} of Warriors original primary guns, the muzzle-loading 68-pounder and the breech-loading 110-pounder, which {{were used as}} moulds for fibreglass replicas. The Armstrong guns were built with working breeches; <b>they,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> muzzles of all the guns, had to be sealed to prevent people leaving rubbish in them. Little information was available on the wooden gun carriages despite extensive research, and a prototype had to be developed and tested before they could be built.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid is a small, soft-bodied insect that has {{specialised}} {{piercing and sucking}} mouthparts which are used to suck the juice from plants. This aphid is usually seen in large numbers and is a tiny, plump insect about two millimetres long with a small head and bulbous abdomen. The body is blackish or dark green in colour. Many adults are devoid of wings, a state known as aptery. Winged forms, known as alates, are longer and more slender than aptates and have shiny black heads and thoraxes. The membranous wings of the alates are held angled over the body. The antennae are less {{than two-thirds of the}} length of the body and both <b>they</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> legs are pale yellow in colour with black tips. The tibiae of the hind legs are swollen in egg-laying females. Near the rear of the abdomen are a pair of slender, elongated tubes known as cornicles or siphunculi. Their function is the production of a defensive waxy secretion. They are twice as long as the finger-like tail and both are brownish-black.|$|E

5|$|The {{iconography}} of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti {{was influenced by}} Gandhara architectural tradition, which impacted the iconographic depictions of sculptures of Northwest India, particularly those made in Kashmir. Keeping with the Gandhara style, the body and legs are depicted as strong and sturdy. The muscular body {{is considered to be}} inflated with prana (life-breath), an Indian concept. The bow arched eyebrows and lotus shaped eyes are also characteristic of the Indian school of sculpture. The presence of the earth goddess at the feet also reflects Central Asian influence. The ayudhapurushas in the icon may be inspired by those in the Vishnu {{iconography of}} Gupta art. <b>They</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> earth goddess are also part of traditional Vishnu iconography, even when he is depicted as one-headed.|$|E
5|$|The medley relay was {{scheduled}} for Thursday, 24 July, the fifth day of swimming competition, with heats {{in the morning and}} the final in the evening. Australia's prospects improved when Sweden was disqualified in the first heat. Australia and the Soviet Union swam in the second heat. With their superior depth, the home team was able to rest their entire first-choice quartet in the heats. On the other hand, Australia was only willing to rest KerryGlenn Patching swam the backstroke leg in his place. The hosts led the Australians from the start and extended their margin over each of the first three legs. Brooks reclaimed 1.34s on the freestyle leg, but the Australians fell 0.13s short to come second in their heat. Nevertheless, the Australians still qualified in second place overall, as <b>they</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Soviets were more than 1.5s faster than the third-placed Hungarians. In any case, despite resting all of their first-choice quartet, the home team were still faster than the Australians, who had fielded all but one of their full-strength team.|$|E
5|$|By early November 1776, the {{majority}} of the regiment's officers and enlisted men had joined Washington's Main Army while it was engaged in the battle for New York City during the New York and New Jersey campaign. They were initially stationed at Fort Washington on Manhattan Island and nearby Fort Lee {{on the opposite side of}} the Hudson River. On November 16, most of the regiment was captured or killed during the Battle of Fort Washington. The riflemen were defending the northern end of the American position from a much larger force of several thousand Hessian troops. After heavy fighting that lasted most of the day and during which the Hessians suffered many casualties, the riflemen were eventually driven from the outer works into the fort where <b>they</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest of the outnumbered American garrison surrendered to the combined British and German attack force. Lieutenant Colonel Rawlings was commanding the regiment during the battle because Colonel Stephenson had died of illness in August or September and had not been replaced. About 140 of the regiment's officers and enlisted men—one-third of the unit's total complement of about 420 men—were not present at the battle, however, because they were still completing organization and recruiting. A few enlisted men of the regiment who escaped from their captors within the short chaotic period following the battle augmented this remaining active force, which continued to serve with the Main Army. On December 1, the first day of the army's next regular reporting period following the fall of Fort Washington, Washington provisionally grouped these remnants of the diminished regiment into two composite rifle companies commanded by the unit's highest ranking officers still free—Capts. Alexander Lawson Smith and Gabriel Long. Smith's company comprised all the remaining Marylanders in the regiment, whereas the Virginians of the unit were placed under Long's command.|$|E

According to Tomasevich, exactly what occurred after his capture is not clear, but Baćović, Đurišić, Vasić and Ostojić were subsequently killed, along with some Serbian Orthodox priests and others.

Fantasy author Neil Gaiman overhears the team talking and offers his help writing the novel; although they allow him to join, he is only given the task of bringing food for them while they are writing. The group members quickly finish the novel, which they name The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy, and meet up with a book publishing executive for TweenLit Inc. at a book fair. Although he likes the novel, he dismisses it because it lacks a fake author with an inspirational back story. Meanwhile, Lisa is having a hard time making progress on her book because of constant distractions and quickly becomes saddened after realizing that she will never have her name on a novel. However, Homer approaches her and offers her to be the fake author of The Troll Twins of Underbridge Academy.
