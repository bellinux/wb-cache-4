5|$|A {{participant}} in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs, Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1962. He made his first space flight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> space. He performed the first docking of two spacecraft, with pilot David Scott. This mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster, in the first in-flight space emergency.|$|E
5|$|Agreements between Norwegian and Russian {{authorities}} {{were made on}} 31 August, where Norway resumed full responsibility for the recovery and investigation, but Russian help was accepted. To allow the Russian workers access from the morning of 1 September, the crew was allowed <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> and establish a base camp, but no work was to be done until Norwegian supervisors arrived in the morning. However, two people were observed at the wreck at about 20:00 CEST, who {{were brought to the}} Governor's offices for questioning. As they were both members of the Russian team, it was decided that the base would be disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Born in Andrews, South Carolina, Overton took {{an early}} {{interest}} in flying, and attended The Citadel {{for a year}} before enlisting in the United States Navy briefly during World War II. Afterward, Overton graduated from West Point and began a career flying the F-84 Thunderjet. In 1952, Overton volunteered <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> the Korean War and flew 102 missions in an F-84 before transferring to the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and flying the F-86 Sabre. During a four-day time period in early 1953, Overton claimed five MiG-15 victories in MiG alley, certifying him as a flying ace. However, he was subsequently returned to the United States in shame after commanders charged him with insubordination for crossing the Yalu River into Manchuria for his victories.|$|E

5|$|Born to a {{military}} family, Newall studied at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before taking a commission as a junior officer in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in 1905. After transferring to the 2nd Gurkha Rifles in the Indian Army, he saw active service on the North West Frontier, but after learning <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> 1911 turned towards a career in military aviation. During the First World War he rose from flying instructor to command of 41st Wing RFC, the main strategic bombing force, and was awarded the Albert Medal for putting out a fire in an explosives store.|$|E
5|$|Flies tend <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> a {{straight}} line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|From 1925 {{until early}} 1928, the Bells lived in Britain while John {{attended}} RAF Staff College, Andover and acted as RAAF liaison officer to the Royal Air Force.

Returning to Australia, {{she was the}} first female to gain a pilot's licence in Victoria, on 20March 1928.

Jenkins from the Sixth Army Group. The plan, codenamed Operation Effective, called for the 13th Airborne Division to occupy the area to prevent its capture by the French, and seize an airfield that could be used <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> an Alsos Mission team, and later to fly it out, along with captured German scientists. Operation Effective was scheduled for 22 April. Meanwhile, Devers took steps to delay the French advance.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, New York hotel owner Raymond Orteig {{offered a}} USD $25,000 prize, the Orteig Prize, {{to the first}} aviators to make a {{non-stop}} transatlantic flight between New York and Paris during the next five years. With no takers, he renewed the offer in 1924, when aviation technology had advanced enough {{at that point that}} many people tried for the prize. Most were attempting to fly from New York to Paris, but a number of French aviators planned an attempt <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction, from Paris to New York.|$|E
5|$|In late May 1988, amid rising {{nationalist}} tensions from glasnost and perestroika, Armenia's new Communist {{party leader}} allowed the banned tricolour of the DRA <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> Yerevan {{for the first}} time in over sixty years. A year later, following a Nagorno-Karabakh-themed mass demonstration where the tricolour was flown, he urged its official recognition. This came on August 24, 1990, a day after the Armenian Supreme Soviet declared the republic's sovereignty and renamed the country the Republic of Armenia. At that point, just over a year before Armenia declared its formal independence from the USSR, the tricolour replaced the 1952 flag.|$|E

He later passed a formal course at the Central Flying School, Upavon in 1913, and began working as a pilot trainer there from 17 November 1913; it was intended that he would form part of a flight training school to be established in India, {{but he had not}} yet left England when the First World War broke out.|$|E
5|$|On April 12, 1961, Soviet {{cosmonaut}} Yuri Gagarin {{became the}} first person <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union.

Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news, refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|Pellerin was {{originally}} scheduled <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> this mission, {{as he had}} done on the 17 June flight.

Due to the short notice of his assignment to the mission, Wolff did not participate in the pre-flight briefing and boarded the aircraft after the engines were started. Thus, Wolff was not aware of the planned mission profile and did not have an opportunity to raise any objections before take-off.|$|E
