5|$|<b>The</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> beetle morphology, in {{particular}} their possession of elytra, has long suggested that Coleoptera is monophyletic, though {{there have been}} doubts about {{the arrangement of the}} suborders, namely the Adephaga, Archostemata, Myxophaga and Polyphaga within that clade. The twisted-wing parasites, Strepsiptera, are thought to be a sister group to the beetles, having split from them in the Early Permian.|$|E
5|$|FreeBSD {{has several}} unique {{features}} related to storage. Soft updates can protect <b>the</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the UFS filesystem (widely {{used on the}} BSDs) {{in the event of}} a system crash. Filesystem snapshots allow an image of a UFS filesystem at an instant in time to be efficiently created. Snapshots allow reliable backup of a live filesystem. GEOM is a modular framework that provides RAID (levels 0, 1, 3 currently), full disk encryption, journaling, concatenation, caching, and access to network-backed storage. GEOM allows building of complex storage solutions combining ("chaining") these mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species are}} oviparous {{like most other}} fish, laying their eggs in the water. In most oviparous shark species, an egg case with <b>the</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> leather protects the {{developing}} embryo(s). These cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection. Once empty, the egg case {{is known as a}} mermaid's purse, and can wash up on shore. Oviparous sharks include the horn shark, catshark, Port Jackson shark, and swellshark.|$|E

5|$|The Emperor faced {{significant}} {{opposition from}} the Samaritans, who resisted conversion to Christianity and were repeatedly in insurrection. He persecuted them with rigorous edicts, but yet could not prevent reprisals towards Christians from taking place in Samaria toward the close of his reign. <b>The</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> Justinian's policy meant that the Manicheans too suffered persecution, experiencing both exile and threat of capital punishment. At Constantinople, on one occasion, not a few Manicheans, after strict inquisition, were executed in the emperor's very presence: some by burning, others by drowning.|$|E
5|$|The agaricoid {{species in}} Lactarius, Lactifluus, Multifurca, and Russula are readily {{distinguished}} from other gilled mushrooms by <b>the</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> their flesh, which is granular, brittle and breaks easily, somewhat {{like a piece}} of chalk. Russulaceae never have a volva, but a partial veil can be found in some tropical species. Gills are adnate to decurrent, and the colour of the spore print ranges from white to ochre or orange (with the brown-spored Lactarius chromospermus as an exception).|$|E
5|$|The maximum spacing {{estimator}} is {{a consistent}} estimator {{in that it}} converges in probability to the true value of the parameter, θ0, as the sample size increases to infinity. <b>The</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> maximum spacing estimation holds under much more general conditions than for maximum likelihood estimators. In particular, {{in cases where the}} underlying distribution is J-shaped, maximum likelihood will fail where MSE succeeds. An example of a J-shaped density is the Weibull distribution, specifically a shifted Weibull, with a shape parameter less than 1. The density will tend to infinity as x approaches the location parameter rendering estimates of the other parameters inconsistent.|$|E

5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The animal's sense organ is altered when it detects an object. This causes a perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not as we now think the brain. This in turn causes {{a change in the}} heart's heat, which causes a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration {{in the heat of the}} heart also causes a change in <b>the</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|E
5|$|An emaki of Murasaki Shikibu's diary is {{mentioned}} in the Meigetsuki ("Record of the clean moon"), the diary of the poet and scholar Fujiwara no Teika. According to this document, in 1233 several aristocrats close to cloistered Emperor Go-Horikawa planned {{to create a new}} emaki of The Tale of Genji (after the 12th century Genji Monogatari Emaki, the best known of these works), accompanied by another of Murasaki's diary. However, there is no conclusive evidence that the extant scrolls correspond to those mentioned by Fujiwara no Teika, even though <b>the</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> manufacturing dates suggests that this is the case. The paintings of the emaki have been attributed to the painter Fujiwara Nobuzane and the captions to the excellent calligrapher Gokyōgoku (後京極良経, 1169–1206), despite definitive evidence.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{lamented the}} effects of his drug use and noted the irony that the drugs did not do much to improve <b>the</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> his performances. On his return to {{international}} competition his times were significantly worse than he achieved prior to drug use: in the 100m final at the 2006 European Championships, Chambers ran a sub-par 10.24s and finished in fifth place. He {{was part of the}} gold medal-winning British 4×100m team, but Darren Campbell, who was angry about losing his 2002 and 2003 relay medals due to Chambers' ban, refused to join the team in a celebratory lap. After the competition, Chambers again expressed an interest in switching to American football and completed a week-long NFL Europa training camp in Cologne that November.|$|E

40|$|ISO/IEC 15504 is an {{emerging}} international standard for software process assessment. It has recently undergone {{a major change}} in the rating scale used to measure the capability of processes. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a follow up evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internal <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> this process capability scale. Internal consistency is a form of reliability of a subjective measurement instrument. A previous study evaluated <b>the</b> internal <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first version of the ISO/IEC 15504 document set (also known as SPICE version 1). In the current study we evaluate <b>the</b> internal <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second version (also known as ISO/IEC PDTR 15504). Our results indicate that <b>the</b> internal <b>consistency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capability dimension did not deteriorate, and that it is still sufficiently high for practical purposes. Furthermore, we identify that the capability scale has two dimensions that we termed "Process Implementation" and "Quantitative Process Management". 1. Introduction Over the l [...] ...|$|R
