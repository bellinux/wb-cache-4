5|$|The pygmy {{blue whale}} formed from a founder group of Antarctic blue whales about 20,000 years ago, around the Last Glacial Maximum. This is likely because blue whales were driven north by {{expanding}} ice, {{and some have}} stayed <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> since. The pygmy blue whale's evolutionarily recent origins cause it to have a relatively low genetic diversity.|$|E

5|$|A second {{reservoir}} {{was built}} around 1860 in Brown Cove, between Swirral Edge and Lower Man, {{along with one}} further down the valley in Keppel Cove. These provided water to generate hydroelectric power for the lead mine. The dam in Keppel Cove is still in place, but water now leaks through its base. The remains of the dam in Brown Cove can be seen, but again water leaks freely through it. It is unclear whether <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> was a natural tarn in Brown Cove. Guidebook writers before 1860 refer only to Keppel Cove Tarn {{to the north of}} Swirral Edge.|$|E
5|$|Between 1878 and 1884, Ipswich Town {{played at}} two grounds in the town, Broom Hill and Brook's Hall, but in 1884, the club moved to Portman Road and have played <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> since. At their new home, Ipswich {{became one of}} the first clubs to {{implement}} the use of goal nets, in 1890, but the more substantial elements of ground development did not begin until, in 1901, a tobacco processing plant was built along the south edge of the ground.|$|E
5|$|Rovers were {{admitted}} to the Football League in 1920 and have played <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> since, apart from spending the 2014–15 season in the Conference Premier. They previously came close to losing their league status in 1939, when they were re-elected after finishing bottom of Division Three (South), and in 2002 when the team finished one league position away from relegation to the Football Conference. Their highest finishing positions were in 1956 and 1959, on both occasions ending the season in 6th place in Division Two, then the second tier of English football. Rovers were Football League Trophy finalists in 1990 and 2007.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently {{recognised}} as {{the design}} {{from which all}} later locomotives are derived, Rocket eventually came to be {{considered one of the}} most important symbols of the Industrial Revolution. It was returned to Robert Stephenson and Company in 1851 with the intention of displaying it at The Great Exhibition, but this did not take place. It was loaned to the Patent Office for display in 1862. Moved to the Science Collection of the South Kensington Museum in 1876 (renamed the Science Museum in 1885), it has remained <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> since other than a brief display at the National Railway Museum.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Kells {{remained}} in Kells until 1654. In that year, Cromwell's cavalry was quartered {{in the church}} at Kells, and {{the governor of the}} town sent the book to Dublin for safekeeping. Henry Jones, who later became bishop of Meath after the Restoration, presented the manuscript to Trinity College in Dublin in 1661, and it has remained <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> since, except for brief loans to other libraries and museums. It has been on display to the public in the Old Library at Trinity since the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale {{returned}} to Bucharest: in summer 1912, {{with help from}} journalist Rudolf Uhrinowsky, the young writer was employed by a French-language gazette, L'Indépendence Roumaine, informing his readers that he had also become the sole legitimate Caragiale family representative in Romania. In October, he became {{the chief of staff}} in the Ministry of Public Works in the second Titu Maiorescu executive, under Minister Alexandru Bădărău. He had manifested a relative interest in politics around 1908, after his father rallied with Take Ionescu and his Conservative-Democratic Party; at the time, he criticized Ion Luca's political choices, but nonetheless noted that it could serve as a means for his own advancement ("From now on I'll have political lode , something certain, if <b>there</b> <b>ever</b> was certainty on Earth.") Four years after this comment, soon after making his literary debut, he clashed with his father over having considered a cabinet appointment in Ionescu's executive.|$|E
