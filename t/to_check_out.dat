5|$|Now {{known as}} Billy Talent, their sound {{began to move}} in a more aggressive, punk rock direction. During this time, Kowalewicz ran into Jen Hirst, at 102.1 the edge, the Toronto radio station he worked at. She had seen the band perform as Pezz, and he asked her <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> the band's {{performance}} at a club. This would prove to pay off, as Hirst was later hired by Warner Music Canada to work in A. This connection would get the band their producer Gavin Brown, and a demo deal with the label. Before the demos were recorded, a local manager called Atlantic Records A executives, who were already in Toronto, to see the band perform in its tiny rehearsal space.|$|E

As Fassl holds up a piece of paper to show it to the family who called for the repair, blood spatter splashes across the paper. He looks up and sees the house's occupants with slit throats in pools of blood. Abruptly, two police officers burst into the house and apprehend Fassl. One of the officers who goes <b>to</b> <b>check</b> <b>out</b> the kitchen turns to reveal he is John Doggett (Robert Patrick) as a young NYPD officer.|$|E

Going to an amusement park to buy some concert tickers at Kumiko's request, the protagonist is attacked by demons and saved by Kyouji Kuzunoha, a Summoner belonging to an ancient clan dedicated to protecting Japan from supernatural threats. Shortly after leaving him, Kuzunoha dies under mysterious circumstances. Shortly after this, the protagonist is attacked by a Dark Summoner named Sid Davis.

25|$|Someone {{has played}} a reprehensible joke on a grieving mother.

There was an investigation concerning that picture, made by the Hillsborough County (FL) Sheriff's Office. No charges were filed, and no wrongdoing was established.

25|$|Just as the {{signature}} of the metric is differently defined in the literature, this quantity is not consistently named.

When signature and interval are fixed, ambiguity still remains as which coordinate is the time coordinate. It may be the fourth, or it may be the zeroth.

With the absolute independence he was known for, he said, “No thank you. I have been at sea since 1934, I’d like a stateside tour, then I’ll be happy to take her to sea.” Turning down a command is never good; turning down command of a carrier, particularly Boxer, the newest of the best, is the end of a career.|$|E

25|$|In May 1942, the 8th {{was without}} any aircraft, {{and the men}} of the {{squadron}} settled down to enjoy the rumor that eventually it would receive A-20 Havocs. Capt.

Hopes were high that the squadron would be re-equipped and everyone was expecting action in the not-too distant future. Their expectations would soon turn to disillusionment as the planes did not arrive—with a negative impact to morale. The crews flew with the 89th in their two borrowed A-20s flying missions, but the unit remained without aircraft until March 1943. Despite this the 8th's crews distinguished themselves flying with the 89th Squadron.|$|E
