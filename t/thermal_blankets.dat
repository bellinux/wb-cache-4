5|$|Soyuz TM-9 {{launched}} EO-6 {{crew members}} Anatoly Solovyev and Aleksandr Balandin on 11 February 1990. While docking, the EO-5 crew noted that three <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> on the ferry were loose, potentially creating problems on reentry, {{but it was}} decided that they would be manageable. Their stay on board Mir saw the addition of the Kristall module, launched 31 May 1990. The first docking attempt on 6 June was aborted due to an attitude control thruster failure. Kristall arrived at the front port on 10 June and was relocated to the lateral port opposite Kvant-2 the next day, restoring the equilibrium of the complex. Due to the delay in the docking of Kristall, EO-6 was extended by 10 days to permit the activation of the module’s systems and to accommodate an EVA to repair the loose <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> on Soyuz TM-9.|$|E
25|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{is covered}} in gold-plated aluminium-tin alloy <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> to maintain a temperature of 10–20°C inside the spacecraft. The instruments that operate at low temperatures to be kept cold are thermally insulated from this relatively high internal temperature, and emit excess heat into space using attached radiators.|$|E
25|$|During the free-flight phase, some shell heaters {{were more}} active than anticipated, {{but because the}} thermal and power {{situation}} remained acceptable, this {{did not affect the}} mission. Visual inspection from the space station later confirmed that some <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> had partially detached. Air trapped under the blankets during launch rapidly expanded as the ATV's altitude increased; more holes were added to future craft to fix this problem.|$|E
50|$|A further {{in-flight}} repair {{was considered}} to remove or clip a damaged <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> located beneath the commander's window {{on the port side}} of the orbiter. Wind tunnel testing by NASA determined that the <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> was safe for re-entry, and plans for a fourth spacewalk were cancelled.|$|R

50|$|A <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> is {{a device}} used in thermal {{desorption}} to clean soil contamination. The primary {{function of a}} <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> is to heat the soil to the boiling point of the contaminants (usually 100 to 325 °C). The contaminants break down. A vacuum pulls the resulting gas (along with some contaminants) into a separate air cleaner that may use various methods, such as carbon filters and high-heat ovens, to completely destroy the contaminants.|$|R
25|$|Much of {{the risk}} {{assessment}} hinged on damage predictions to the thermal protection system. These fall into two categories: damage to the silica tile on the wing lower surface, and damage to the reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) leading-edge panels. The TPS includes a third category of components, thermal insulating blankets, but damage predictions are not typically performed on them. Damage assessments on the <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> can be performed after an anomaly has been observed, {{and this has been}} done at least once after the return to flight following Columbia's loss.|$|E
25|$|During {{the mission}} status briefing, LeRoy Cain {{stated that the}} image {{analysis}} team was still evaluating the ascent imagery, but that the vehicle looked very clean, and the only event that was seen on launch, the area under the left OMS pod, {{appeared to have been}} ice. The images taken during the flight day two survey showed that all of the <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> in that area were intact, as were the tiles. Cain stated that the item did not strike the orbiter, it was the only event that the Mission Management Team was still evaluating, and that the orbiter was in good shape. Mike Sarafin confirmed that the Ku band antenna performed properly in radar mode, and docking was carried out without any problems with the antenna.|$|E
2500|$|The second EVA of STS-134 was {{conducted}} on flight day 7 by Drew Feustel and Mike Fincke. The spacewalk, the sixth-longest {{in the history of}} spaceflight thus far, lasted 8 hours and 7 minutes, significantly longer than the planned 6 hours and 30 minutes. The excursion also marked the second-longest spacewalk conducted from the ISS. During the spacewalk, Fincke and Feustel hooked up a jumper to transfer [...] of ammonia to the Port 6 Photovoltaic Thermal Control System (PVTCS), lubricated the Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ) and one of the [...] "hands" [...] on Dextre, and installed a stowage beam on the Starboard 1 (S1) truss. During the lubrication task on the Port SARJ, some of the bolts on one of the <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> came free, and one was lost. Commander Mark Kelly documented the spacewalk with still and video cameras, while mission specialist Greg Chamitoff assisted Feustel and Fincke. The spacewalk was the seventh for Fincke and the fifth for Feustel. Fincke had conducted his previous six spacewalks in Russian Orlan suits.|$|E

40|$|The {{results are}} {{described}} {{of a series}} of current conduction tests with a <b>thermal</b> control <b>blanket</b> to which grounding straps have been attached. The material and the ground strap attachment procedure are described. The current conduction tests consisted of a surge current examination of the ground strap and a dilute flow, energetic electron deposition and transport through the bulk of the insulating film of this <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> material. Both of these test procedures were used previously with <b>thermal</b> control <b>blanket</b> materials...|$|R

2500|$|The {{second of}} three spacewalks was {{completed}} on flight day 7. Bob Behnken and Nick Patrick {{were able to}} complete all their planned tasks in 5 hours and 54 minutes. The tasks included installing ammonia coolant loops, <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> to protect the ammonia hoses, outfitting the earth facing port of Tranquility for the Cupola, install handrails and a non-propulsive vent valve (NPV). During the connection {{of one of the}} ammonia hoses, a small amount of ammonia leaked out of a quick disconnect valve and floated towards Nick Patrick. Procedures called for a [...] "bake-out" [...] while Patrick worked during the sunlit portion of the orbit, and a contamination test in the airlock. The bake-out happened {{at the end of the}} spacewalk. While the spacewalk was happening, Terry Virts and Kay Hire along with ISS commander Jeff Williams, Soichi Noguchi and T.J. Creamer, continued outfitting the Tranquility module. This included setting up the ventilation system, connecting electrical and computer cables and configuring racks. They confirmed lights and computers were on in the node once the ammonia cooling system had been activated. The crew also received word the mission had been extended by one day in the morning.|$|E

The most recent omnidirectional peak Jovian electron flux at 5 Jupiter radii is applied, the electron current penetrating the <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> is calculated and allowed to impinge on a typical 20 mil polyethylene insulator surrounding a wire. The radiation dose rate to the insulator is then calculated and the electrical conductivity found. The results demonstrate that the increased electronic mobility is sufficient to keep the maximum induced electric field two orders of magnitude below the critical breakdown strength...|$|R

50|$|Kapton is a {{polyimide}} film {{developed by}} DuPont {{in the late}} 1960s that remains stable across {{a wide range of}} temperatures, from −269 to +400 °C (−452 to 752 °F; 4-673 K). Kapton is used in, among other things, flexible printed circuits (flexible electronics) and <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> used on spacecraft, satellites, and various space instruments.|$|E
40|$|Experiments are {{described}} which were {{conducted at the}} JPL Advanced Teleoperator Lab to demonstrate and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} various teleoperator control modes in the performance of a simulated Solar Max Satellite Repair (SMSR) task. THe SMSR was selected as a test because it is very rich in performance capability requirements and it actually has been performed by two EVA astronauts in the Space Shuttle Bay in 1984. The main subtasks are: <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> removal; installation of a hinge attachment for electrical panel opening; opening of electrical panel; removal of electrical connectors; relining of cable bundles; replacement of electrical panel; securing parts and cables; re-mate electrical connectors; closing of electrical panel; and reinstating <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket.</b> The current performance experiments are limited to <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> cutting, electrical panel unbolting and handling electrical bundles and connectors. In one formal experiment even different control modes were applied to the unbolting and reinsertion of electrical panel screws subtasks. The seven control modes are alternative combinations of manual position and rate control with force feedback and remote compliance referenced to force-torque sensor information. Force-torque sensor and end effector position data and task completion times were recorded for analysis and quantification of operator performance...|$|R
50|$|There is {{a concern}} that as a {{contaminant}} becomes heated, it may leak outside of {{the area of the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket.</b> Therefore, the blanket must completely cover the contaminated area and have a strong enough vacuum to prohibit the spread of contaminations.|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} a {{multilayer}} <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> in eliminating arcing is discussed. Arcing is eliminated by limiting the surface potential to well below the threshold level for discharge. This is achieved by enhancing the leakage current which results in conduction of the excess charge to the spacecraft structure. The <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> consists of several layers of thermal control (space approved) materials, bonded together, with Kapton on the outside, arranged {{in such a way}} that when the outer surface is charged by electron irradiation, a strong electric field is set up on the Kapton layer resulting in a greatly improved conductivity. The basic properties of matter utilized in designing this blanket method of charge removal, and optimum thermo-optical properties are summarized...|$|R
50|$|Before Kirchhoff's law was recognized, it {{had been}} {{experimentally}} established that a good absorber is a good emitter, and a poor absorber is a poor emitter. Naturally, a good reflector must be a poor absorber. This is why, for example, lightweight emergency <b>thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> are based on reflective metallic coatings: they lose little heat by radiation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>blankets</b> {{slow the}} rate of heat {{emission}} and camouflage nets use a mix of materials with differing thermal properties to operate in the infra-red as well as the visible spectrum. Camouflage attempts to break up the distinctive appearance and silhouette of a tank. Adopting a turret-down or hull-down position reduces the visible silhouette of a tank as well as providing the added protection of a position in defilade.|$|E
40|$|The problem studied is the {{comparison}} of selected window treatments or coverings and the heat loss that occurs in a given area when all other elements remain constant. Included {{in this study are}} the following window treatments: Venetian blinds, lined draperies, a <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket</b> and an untreated or uncovered window. The uncovered window was employed as the control element in this research. Systematic observations of heat losses of the several different window treatments measured during a twelve hour period of darkness, to eliminate solar heat gain, were used to obtain readings of temperature fluctuation related to insulating properties of the selected materials. The data indicated that the lined draperies retain room temperature more effectively than either the Venetian blinds or the <b>thermal</b> <b>blanket.</b> Advisor: Christine F. Salmon...|$|R
