500|$|Several {{gameplay}} {{elements were}} scrapped or {{removed from the}} final game. One {{of the features of}} its predecessors, artificial intelligence-controlled squadmates, were removed from single-player missions. This decision was made because the team wanted players <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> squad controlled by actual players rather than computers. The team once considered adding a map editor so that players could design their own maps, but this plan never came to fruition. Hit markers, which would indicate an injury inflicted on an opponent, were removed because the team feared that players would abuse the system by [...] "peppering the walls with gunfire" [...] and use hit markers to locate enemies. Players cannot jump in the game, as real-life counter-terrorist unit operators do not jump while carrying out their missions.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{returned}} for the 1993 season enticed by the chance <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> new coach (Dan Reeves), and {{determined not to}} end his career due to an injury. The Giants had a resurgent season in 1993. They finished 11–5, and competed for the top NFC playoff seed. Taylor finished with 6 sacks, and the Giants defense led the NFL in fewest points allowed. They defeated the Vikings 17–10 in the opening round of the playoffs. The next week on January 15, 1994 in what would be Taylor's final game, the Giants were beaten 44–3 by the 49ers. As the game came to a conclusion, television cameras drew in close on Taylor who was crying. He announced his retirement at the post-game press conference saying, [...] "I think it's {{time for me to}} retire. I've done everything I can do. I've been to Super Bowls. I've been to playoffs.

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2008 Mayhem Festival, drummer Joey Jordison {{broke his}} ankle.

Despite the injury, Jordison could still walk and subsequently played the next night.

500|$|Sunshine offered open fields, and {{the three}} Miller boys quickly took a liking to sport during their childhood, playing Australian rules {{football}} in winter and cricket in summer. Their father had played cricket for Warracknabeal, winning a premiership in the local league in 1900. Les taught the boys <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> side-on stance and underlined the importance of orthodox batting technique, reminding his sons to maintain a high leading elbow when hitting the ball. They were taught {{to rely on a}} solid defence, concentration, and self-control in the mould of the leading Victorian and Australian Test batsman of the era, Bill Ponsford. Miller began his schooling in Sunshine, where he quickly became known for his diminutive height; {{he was one of the}} smallest children in the school. At the age of seven, Miller moved to the inner-eastern middle-class Melbourne suburb of Elsternwick, where his parents had purchased a two-storey house with a spacious garden that allowed the children to play sport. By this time, his elder brothers had given him the derisive nickname Weedy. Miller's small size and age deficit meant that he conceded a strength advantage to his brothers in backyard cricket matches. This forced him to develop his technique rather than rely on power, which held him in good stead for his future career. Whenever Miller managed to dismiss his brothers and earn himself some batting time, he typically played with a straight bat in a watchful manner, as it was difficult for him to remove his brothers, meaning that his opportunities with the bat were rare. Miller and his friends would loiter outside Ponsford's home, just [...] away, in the hope of catching a glimpse of their hero.Perry, p. 13. Like Miller in his backyard, Ponsford was known for his powers of concentration and was the first person to score two quadruple centuries in first-class cricket.Perry, p. 14. Miller often practised for hours by himself; he put a tennis ball inside a stocking, before suspending it from a clothes line and hitting it back and forth. Indoors, Miller developed a lifelong love of classical music through a cousin who liked to play Mozart. He played flute in the Elsternwick school band but could not read music.|$|E
