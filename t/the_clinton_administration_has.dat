[...] "The United States is {{the only member of the}} Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to pass legislation — the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act — criminalizing the payment of a bribe to a foreign official. The legislation arose out of the American bribery scandals of the 1970s. These restraints, which are extraterritorial in scope, have proven a constant irritant to Americans doing business abroad. According to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the legislation costs American companies [...] "hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts every year".

40|$|In {{the first}} section of this paper, I will discuss the {{promotion}} of democracy as part of U. S. grand strategy in the Post-Cold War era. I will present different and conflicting scholarly opinions regarding the role of democracy promotion and the sort of priority that it should hold for U. S. foreign policy. In the last eight years, <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> adopted a strategy that most closely resembles the model of Cooperative Security, although turning in the direction of Primacy, a direction that the Bush administration is likely to follow. I will use the frame that I have developed about the priority of democracy promotion for U. S. grand strategy, to consider U. S. -Cuban relations. Prior to the fall of the Soviet bloc, U. S. policy on Cuba was directly related to containing the threat of communism. After the Cuban revolution of 1959, the rise of Fidel Castro and his ensuing decision to declare the revolution socialist to receive Soviet [aid] were extremely threatening to the United States because it gave the Soviets a very close geographical location to the U. S. and a charismatic leader who was interested in liberating other small nations from their imperialistic governments. Therefore, the Cuban revolution was not only an ideological loss, but it became a national security threat for the United States...|$|E

Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has already presented a bold program for skill enhancement drawing on a new consensus in certain circles of the social science and policy communities {{about the need to}} upgrade the nation's skills. An apparently new approach to training and education has been proposed and Secretary Reich is now busy selling it to the Congress and the Nation. This paper provides background on the problems in the labor market that motivate the new Clinton-Reich initiatives on training and schooling. It briefly summarizes the proposed strategies and the background philosophy for the Clinton-Reich agenda. It then considers the evidence that supports or contradicts assumptions of their plan. There is a lot of evidence about many of the 'new' proposals because some are reworked versions of old programs that have been carefully evaluated. Other proposals borrow ideas from Germany. I compare the rhetoric that accompanies these proposals {{in the context of the}} U. S. labor market. Still other proposals have been evaluated in demonstration projects but the lessons from these evaluations have not yet influenced administration thinking. This is unfortunate because many current plans are based on assumptions that have been discredited in careful empirical studies.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> {{made much}} of its record on {{employment}} and economic growth. The 1999 Economic Report of the President, for example, claims, citing a host of recent statistics, that "gains from the ongoing economic expansion [have been] distributed throughout the population, reaching groups {{that had previously been}} left out " (Council of Economic Advisers 1999, 116). However, although the gains of the past seven years are certainly not insignificant, the story told by the White House, government agencies, and the media is far from complete. Behind the healthy numbers lurks a disturbing fact. Despite a strong economic expansion, more than 28 million persons aged 25 to 64 (20 percent of that age group) were classified by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) as out of the labor force (OLF) in 1998. These are people who are neither employed nor classified by the BLS as unemployed. If we look at the entire 25 and over population, we see almost 56 million persons out of the labor force in 1998, and this is in addition to those classified as unemployed. A large proportion of the OLF adults have a low income and low educational attainment. In an earlier brief (Pigeon and Wray 1998), we found that {{over the course of the}} Clinton expansion, fewer than 500, 000 jobs were created for the half of the population that have a high school degree or less.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> been {{characterized}} by numerous efforts to {{encourage the use of}} technology in public education, rooted in the conviction that such activities are a prerequisite for improvements in the econonomy, the environment, and the overall quality of life. Urban public schools face particularly difficult challenges to such technology implementation. The challenges include aged physical plants, extreme fund-ing difficulties, high levels of administrative turnover, and inadequate professional development programs. This article examines the implications of attempting to integrate extensive technology into such environments and considers the perspective that technology is best viewed as part of, rather than a competitor to, the implementation of a school reform model. When Bill Clinton and Al Gore came to Washington as the first baby boomer administration, they made a point of presenting themselves as &dquo;high tech. &dquo; As a senator, Gore had introduced the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, and in an early presidential address, Clinton (1993 b) made a point of describing how, on his arrival at the White House, he found and immediately replaced Jimmy Carter’s telephone sys-tem and Lyndon Johnson’s basement switchboard. This 1993 address was used as a launching point for the Clinton administration’s technology policy initiative. In this initiative, the president articulated the neces-sity for technology to &dquo;grow&dquo; the economy, improve environmental quality, ensure U. S. leadership in world markets, and improve the quality of life. He also ex-pressed the intention to create &dquo;an educational system where every student is challenged,&dquo; where support is available for &dquo;disadvantaged groups in the U.
