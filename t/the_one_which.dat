A Network Rail spokesman confirmed that lessons learned from the previous project had been applied to the Borders project, such as better coordination between the different teams by having them together in one office in Newtongrange. In June 2013, the design contract for the line was awarded to URS which agreed to design new bridges, stations and roads, as well as the refurbishment of existing bridges and the provision of engineering support, for £3.5 million.|$|E

5|$|Two-level utilitarianism is {{virtually}} {{a synthesis of}} the opposing doctrines of act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism states that in all cases the morally right action is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>which</b> produces the most pleasure, whereas rule utilitarianism states that the morally right action {{is the one that}} is in accordance with a moral rule whose general observance would create the most happiness. In terms of two-level utilitarianism, act utilitarianism can be likened to the 'critical' level of moral thinking, and rule utilitarianism to the 'intuitive' level.|$|E
5|$|While the MacBook Pro largely {{followed}} the industrial design standard {{set by the}} PowerBook G4, the MacBook was Apple's first notebook to use features now standard in its notebooks – the glossy display, the sunken keyboard design and the non-mechanical magnetic latch.

5|$|Alamo Force was {{responsible}} for coordinating plans for the invasion of western New Britain. The Arawe landing was scheduled for 15December as this was the earliest date by which the air bases around Nadzab in New Guinea, which were needed to support the landing, could be made operational. This date also gave the landing force time to conduct essential training and rehearsals. As Arawe {{was believed to be}} only weakly defended, Krueger decided to use a smaller force than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>which</b> had been intended for the landing at Gasmata. This force, designated the Director Task Force, was concentrated at Goodenough Island where it was stripped of all equipment not needed for combat operations. Logistical plans called for the assault echelon to carry 30 days worth of general supplies and enough ammunition for three days of intensive combat. After the landing, holdings would be expanded to 60 days worth of general supplies and six days worth of all categories of ammunition other than anti-aircraft ammunition, for which a 10-day supply was thought necessary. The assault force and its supplies were to be carried in fast ships which could rapidly unload their cargo.|$|E

5|$|Another study corroborated {{the latter}} study's results but found {{the growth rate}} to be much faster, finding it to be around 1800 {{kilograms}} (4000lbs). Although these results were much higher than previous estimations, the authors noted that these results significantly lowered the great difference between its actual growth rate and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>which</b> would be expected of an animal of its size. The sudden change in growth rate {{at the end of}} the growth spurt may indicate physical maturity, a hypothesis which is supported by the discovery of medullary tissue in the femur of a 16 to 20-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex from Montana (MOR 1125, also known as B-rex). Medullary tissue is found only in female birds during ovulation, indicating that B-rex was of reproductive age. Further study indicates an age of 18 for this specimen. In 2016, it was finally confirmed by Mary Higby Schweitzer and Lindsay Zanno et al that the soft tissue within the femur of MOR 1125 was medullary tissue. This also confirmed the identity of the specimen as a female. The discovery of medullary bone tissue within Tyrannosaurus may prove valuable in determining the sex of other dinosaur species in future examinations, as the chemical makeup of medullary tissue is unmistakable. Other tyrannosaurids exhibit extremely similar growth curves, although with lower growth rates corresponding to their lower adult sizes.|$|E
5|$|By 1976, a twinjet layout, {{similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>which</b> had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the {{baseline}} configuration. The {{decision to use}} two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous, the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets. As such, {{it was intended to}} transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7. Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757. Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.|$|E

However, Vivien soon got a letter from her lover Baroness Hélène van Zuylen and went to Constantinople thinking she would break up with her in person. Vivien planned to meet Barney in Paris afterward but instead stayed with the Baroness and this time, the breakup was permanent.|$|E

5|$|Notosusanto {{was made}} {{a member of the}} Fourth Development Cabinet when it was formed on 16 March 1983, {{replacing}} outgoing minister Daud Jusuf and taking office three days later. During his two years as minister he worked on several programmes, including compulsory education and student selection systems. He also instituted a new curriculum, replacing <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>which</b> had been in use since 1975 and promoting the humanities. Concurrently with his work as Minister of Education and Culture, Notosusanto served as rector of UI; students were disapproving of his selection, considering him a military official sent to limit their freedom. He died at his Jakarta home on 3 June 1985 after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage and was buried at Kalibata Heroes' Cemetery. At {{the time he was a}} brigadier general, the highest rank then available for civilians in military service.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{identified}} the contributions from Driessen, Flanders and Boyer as of particular interest, though challenged {{the inclusion of}} chapters focussed on the environment. They also criticised the book's failure to include contributions from, or sufficiently engage with the work of, the key voices in the politically focused animal ethics literature, such as Robert Garner, Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka, Alasdair Cochrane, Kimberly Smith or Siobhan O'Sullivan. Wissenburg's chapter was identified as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>which</b> engaged most directly with this literature; his approach, however, was a negative one. Garner has written that Political Animals and Animal Politics should be praised for its trailblazing, but predicted {{that it would be}} superseded by stronger collections on the same theme.|$|E
5|$|Shelley {{uses the}} {{historical}} novel {{to comment on}} gender relations; for example, Valperga is a feminist version of Scott's masculinist genre. Introducing women into the story who {{are not part of}} the historical record, Shelley uses their narratives to question established theological and political institutions. Shelley sets the male protagonist's compulsive greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative: reason and sensibility. In Perkin Warbeck, Shelley's other historical novel, Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship, domesticity, and equality. Through her, Shelley offers a feminine alternative to the masculine power politics that destroy the male characters. The novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>which</b> usually relates only masculine events.|$|E

5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted {{portions of the}} background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on {{the location of the}} cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>which</b> will save the character.|$|E
5|$|While {{there were}} several changed to the playing staff, {{the core of the}} team that had played in the Second Division {{remained}} intact. Centre forward Joe Eddleston, Nelson's top goalscorer in each of the previous three seasons, was retained along with captain Clem Rigg, Welsh half-back Jack Newnes and goalkeeper Harry Abbott. The two most senior squad members, David Wilson and goalkeeper Joseph Birds, retired from professional football aged 40 and 36 respectively. Inside forward Dick Crawshaw, who had been the team's second-highest scorer in 1923–24 with five goals, moved to Stalybridge Celtic. Scottish forward Mike McCulloch ended his two-year association with the club by joining Chesterfield on a free transfer, while half-back Leigh Collins signed for New Brighton. Other players, including William Lammus and Ernest Gillibrand, left Nelson having failed to establish themselves in the first-team during their time with the club. Manager Wilson spent a total of £750 (£ as of 2011) on new players in the summer of 1924. Billy Bottrill and Bill Ellerington arrived from Middlesbrough, while Barrow full-back James Phizacklea was signed to bolster the defensive line. Several young players were acquired from local non-League football during the close season, including Ambrose Harris from Briercliffe and Billy Harper, formerly of Feniscowles. The Nelson squad was considered by the local newspaper to be stronger than <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>which</b> had won the Third Division North two seasons earlier.|$|E
