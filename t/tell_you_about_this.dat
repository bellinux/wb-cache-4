I've no doubt {{it was really a}} more tragical case. They looked dreadfully poor and squalid. Why couldn't I have amused my idle fancy with their fortunes--the sort of husband and father they had, their shabby home, the struggle of their life? That is the appeal that a genuine person listens to. Nothing does more to stamp me a poseur than the fact that I preferred to bemoan myself for a sulky girl who seemed not to be having a good time." ...|$|R

But I will go off upon no more side tracks; for when I think of all that is coming, I can see very well that I shall have more than enough to do before I have finished. For when a man has only his own little private tale to tell, it often takes him all his time; but when he gets mixed up in such great matters as I shall have to speak about, then it is hard on him, if he has not been brought up to it, to get it all set down to his liking. But my memory is as good as ever, thank God, and I shall try to get it all straight before I finish.|$|R
6000|$|She resolutely {{took him}} to her {{favorite}} white and green cottages and Georgian houses. He admitted that fanlights, and white shutters against rosy brick, were more homelike than a painty wooden box. He volunteered, [...] "I see how you mean. They make me think of these pictures of an old-fashioned Christmas. Oh, if you keep at it long enough you'll have Sam and me reading poetry and everything.

This property is called elasticity. It is sometimes called the expansive force of the air. For it is a force tending to expand the air, that is, to swell it out into its original dimensions. This is another great difference between air and water.|$|E
60|$|If I take up my pen to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> {{you must}} not look for any story at my hands, for I was only in my {{earliest}} manhood when these things befell; and although I saw something of the stories of other lives, I could scarce claim one of my own. It is {{the love of a}} woman that makes the story of a man, and many a year was to pass before I first looked into the eyes of the mother of my children. To us it seems but an affair of yesterday, and yet those children can now reach the plums in the garden whilst we are seeking for a ladder, and where we once walked with their little hands in ours, we are glad now to lean upon their arms. But I shall speak of a time when the love of a mother was the only love I knew, and if you seek for something more, then it is not for you that I write. But if you would come out with me into that forgotten world; if you would know Boy Jim and Champion Harrison; if you would meet my father, one of Nelson's own men; if you would catch a glimpse of that great seaman himself, and of George, afterwards the unworthy King of England; if, above all, you would see my famous uncle, Sir Charles Tregellis, the King of the Bucks, and the great fighting men whose names are still household words amongst you, then give me your hand and let us start.|$|E

40|$|We {{are fascinated}} by disentanglement puzzles. Why? Probably, {{at least in}} part, because, unlike put-together puzzles (pieces-in-box), take-apart puzzles (puzzle boxes), or {{interlocking}} solid puzzles (burrs), {{there seems to be}} little theory to support the design and solution of disentanglement puzzles. We have been intrigued by (our lack of understanding) how disentanglement puzzles are designed and what it takes to solve them. Nevertheless, it also appears that you can do some systematic thinking about these puzzles. In this article we present a project to develop open-source software to assist in the solution and design of (a limited class of) disentanglement puzzles. It is a follow-up on the presentation <b>about</b> <b>this</b> topic at the Dutch Cube Day in October 2008. For other puzzle types there is plenty of computer assistance. Computers are powerful enough to offer a good graphical user interface, and to do extensive complicated searches. So, we think the time is right to start working on disentanglement puzzles now. The project already has a presence at SourceForge: [URL] We are looking for people who are crazy about disentanglement puzzles and who would like to participate in the project. <b>This</b> article <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> effort...|$|R

[...] He spoke off the cuff for 15 minutes without a script, and the producers were enthralled. Since then he has been working without a script. The series was titled Homicide Hunter: Lt Joe Kenda, first aired in September 2011 on Investigation Discovery network, becoming a top viewer ratings performer.|$|E

5000|$|Earlier today, {{executives}} from CBS {{reached out to}} me and advised me that their legal team strongly suggested {{that we do not}} move forward with plans to create a sequel to Horizon. While this is a sign of the current climate that we find ourselves in with Star Trek fan films, I want to personally thank CBS for reaching out to me, rather than including us in their ongoing lawsuit against Axanar.It was conveyed that the reason CBS was reaching out to me was due to the legal troubles stemming from the Axanar case. Again, CBS did not have to reach out personally. The message I received felt more like they were giving me a heads up before we got too involved in another project, rather than a group of angry executives swinging a hammer.On behalf of myself and Ryan Webber, my co-writer and co-producer on Federation Rising, we appreciate your initial support and are saddened that we cannot bring you what we believe was a fantastic feature film. However, rest assured that Ryan and I are committed to continuing our storytelling partnership with an original project. We also welcome other fan productions and fan film lovers to join us on this new venture.While we initially planned to debut our Kickstarter for Federation Rising this Saturday, we hope that you will instead stand with us as we announce an original sci-fi project that Ryan and I have been co-developing in addition to Federation Rising. We’re incredibly excited to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> completely original story that follows the ideals set forth by Star Trek that Ryan and I have been such huge fans and admirers of our entire lives.|$|E

40|$|Transcription begins] UNITED STATES NAVY 3 Oct. 43 Dear friends Just {{recently}} I received {{your letter}} of May 30 th. Naturally I {{was glad to}} hear from you all. I must apologize for not writing sooner but I have been very busy. Since coming up here to Dutch Harbor I have received some cigarettes which you sent me. Let me thank you right now for thinking of me. I must admit that I never kept in touch with the Bryant Service Club but I have moved around quite a bit since coming in service. There isn’t much I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> place for we are subject to censorship. I am going on my forth month up here and it isn’t so bad. We have bowling alleys, gym, and movies up here. Hence we are really living. I write often to my ex roommate Larry Barbeau, he is still in Virginia. I was glad to hear Ben Scuda was found alive. I knew him very well. Often I think of the swell times I had back at Bryant and wished that I was there once again. I think of all the friends I made there and wonder where they are. I have no idea when I will get back to the states again. Most likely not for a long time. We must all have faith and know that victory will soon be ours. Please remember me to the Faculty and to everyone else. I will be anxious to hear form you in the near future. Until we meet again Yours trulyRichard C. Walrath Richard C. Walrath SK 3 /cCo.

[...] For the wheat-plant is in reality {{the same thing as}} the wheat-seed, and its life the same life, {{different}} as the outside of it may look. Dig it up just at this time of year, and you will find the seed-corn all gone, sucked dry; the life of the wheat-seed has formed it into a wheat-plant--yet it is the same individual thing. The substance of the seed has gone into the root and the young blade; but it is the same individual substance. You know it is, and though <b>you</b> cannot <b>tell</b> why, yet <b>you</b> say [...] "What a fine plant that seed has grown into," [...] because you feel it is so, that the seed is the very same thing as the plant which springs up from it, though its shape is changed, and its size, and its colour, and the very stuff of which it was made is changed, since it was a mere seed. And yet it is at bottom the same individual thing as the seed was, with a new body and shape.|$|R

40|$|We {{recognized}} this bird damage problem from an agricultural standpoint around 1950. It seemingly was growing {{and when we}} looked into it; it later appeared {{that this was the}} case. The problem was quickly resolved to be primarily red-winged blackbirds in corn. We also have problems of damage to fruit crops such as apples, or peaches by starling and other birds, in grapes probably by warblers and most certainly star¬lings in certain seasons. But, this isn 2 ̆ 7 t as consistent and persistent at the corn damage by red-winged blackbirds. We began about 8 years ago to make a survey and we got the blessing of everybody concerned to run an ecological project. In this ecological project we were going to determine the life history and the eco¬logy, the interrelationships, the behavior of the blackbirds, and we did this and came up with many of the same results that you 2 ̆ 7 ve heard about today. That is, the previous speakers have practically summed up our findings. They 2 ̆ 7 re the same; they 2 ̆ 7 re uniform. In some cases we used their findings to come to some of our conclusions. We also formed an interregional agricultural group to determine what could be done. Because the north central agricultural research experiment station directors were not in accord with operating this program in the north-central region, Ohio joined the northeast region and the chairman, Dr. Philip Granett of Rutgers University, of the northeast region is present at this meeting, and I 2 ̆ 7 ll probably have him <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> a little bit later. I 2 ̆ 7 m a member of the technical committee of the northeast region experiment station groups in which the experiment station people co¬operate with the fish and wildlife people, in this common problem of preventing crop depredations by birds. We can sum up rather quickly {{the things that we have}} done under two headings: one under Evaluation and the other under Ecology. First we 2 ̆ 7 ve evaluated things. We 2 ̆ 7 ve evaluated exploders in preventing damage. We 2 ̆ 7 ve evaluated varieties of corn. We 2 ̆ 7 ve evaluated insects [...] insect sprays to keep birds out. We 2 ̆ 7 ve evaluated diversion crops. Evaluated types of soil. Evaluated different habitats. We 2 ̆ 7 ve evaluated exploders and alarm cries, shocking devices and chemicals...|$|E

5000|$|The reason I'm <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> is {{to explain}} what I know about Sloan's lake. The stage line was from Denver to Golden and Central City. The road was the {{southern}} route to Golden and we crossed the Platte river where Larimer street crosses it now, and the road went on out over the hill and into that wide sag, or swale, where Sloan's lake is now. The road was good right down {{through the middle of}} what would now be the bed of the lake. In June, 1861, when I went down into Kansas territory to keep a stage station, there wasn't any lake there. When I came back {{in the early part of}} 1863, less than two years later, there was the lake just as it is now, and it never has changed a bit that ever I could see. There was some talk years afterward about a man having dug a well there and it overflowed, forming the lake, but I was along there about as much as anybody and I never saw any well. However, it may have started from a well. All I know is that it came there in a good deal less than two year, to my certain knowledge. When I came back from the lower country, the road I used to travel was changed. The lake had covered up the old right of way.|$|R
