5|$|In later centuries Narihira {{has been}} {{considered}} <b>the</b> <b>epitome</b> <b>of</b> the amorous bel homme, and his romantic escapades {{have given rise to}} many later legends. He and his contemporary Ono no Komachi were considered the archetypes of the beautiful man and woman of the Heian court, and appear as such in many later literary works, particularly in Noh theatre.|$|E
5|$|KRS-One {{considered}} Run-D.M.C. <b>the</b> <b>epitome</b> <b>of</b> {{rap music}} in 1984 and {{had begun to}} rap following their lead.

5|$|There {{were rumors}} of plots {{and even of}} his escape, but in reality no serious {{attempts}} were made. For English poet Lord Byron, Napoleon was <b>the</b> <b>epitome</b> <b>of</b> the Romantic hero, the persecuted, lonely, and flawed genius.|$|E
50|$|Technically, all volume renderings become {{projections}} {{when viewed}} on a 2-dimensional display, making {{the distinction between}} projections and volume renderings a bit vague.

5|$|The faction {{was created}} to feud with wrestlers {{who had been a}} part of the {{original}} Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion in the 1990s. WWE revived ECW as a third brand in 2006, and hired several former ECW wrestlers – the ECW Originals – to compete on the brand. In early 2007, the New Breed was created when Vince McMahon, the WWE chairman, touted Burke and Cor Von as <b>the</b> <b>epitome</b> <b>of</b> the new ECW, while insulting the ECW Originals. Striker, Thorn, and Ariel joined the following week.|$|E
5|$|South Indian {{music and}} dances {{such as the}} Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam styles are popular in the Deccan region. As {{a result of their}} culture policies, North Indian music and dance gained {{popularity}} during the rule of the Mughals and Nizams, and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with tawaif (courtesans). These courtesans were revered as <b>the</b> <b>epitome</b> <b>of</b> etiquette and culture, and were appointed to teach singing, poetry and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy. This gave rise to certain styles of court music, dance and poetry. Besides western and Indian popular music genres such as filmi music, the residents of Hyderabad play city-based marfa music, dholak ke geet (household songs based on local Folklore), and qawwali, especially at weddings, festivals and other celebratory events. The state government organises the Golconda Music and Dance Festival, the Taramati Music Festival and the Premavathi Dance Festival to further encourage the development of music.|$|E
5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber {{became an}} easy target for other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as <b>the</b> <b>epitome</b> <b>of</b> morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely for the sins of his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it was not merely the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.|$|E
50|$|Volume {{rendering}} {{is distinguished}} from thin slice tomography presentations, {{and is also}} generally distinguished from projections of 3D models, including maximum intensity projection. Still, technically, all volume renderings become projections when viewed on a 2-dimensional display, making the distinction between projections and volume renderings a bit vague. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>epitomes</b> <b>of</b> volume rendering models feature a mix of for example coloring and shading {{in order to create}} realistic and/or observable representations.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>epitomes</b> <b>of</b> Aurelius Victor (De Caesaribus), Eutropius (Breviarium), Festus (Breviarium), and the {{anonymous}} author <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Epitome</b> de Caesaribus offer compressed secular {{political and military}} histories of the period. Although not Christian, <b>the</b> <b>epitomes</b> paint a favorable image of Constantine, but omit reference to Constantine's religious policies. The Panegyrici Latini, a collection of panegyrics from the late third and early fourth centuries, provide valuable information on the politics and ideology of the tetrarchic period and the early life of Constantine. Contemporary architecture, such as the Arch of Constantine in Rome and palaces in Gamzigrad and Córdoba, epigraphic remains, and the coinage of the era complement the literary sources.|$|R

5000|$|Lambert was the prototypical {{middle linebacker}} for {{what became the}} Tampa Two defense. Bud Carson, in his [...] "Double-Rotating Zone" [...] defense where safeties played back in a two-deep zone and the corner-backs played in two shallow zones or in bump-and-run coverage, instead of having the middle linebacker close to the line in run support, had the middle linebacker drop back into a middle zone to cover the seam between the safeties. Middle linebackers had not been tasked {{in such a way}} {{previously}} (Dick Butkus and Ray Nitschke being <b>the</b> <b>epitomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> run-support middle linebacker), but Lambert's size, speed, and talents facilitated the new role.|$|R
40|$|Studies from {{neuroscience}} {{show that}} part-mapping computations are employed by human visual {{system in the}} process of object recognition. In this paper, we present an approach for analyzing semantic-part characteristics of object category representations. For our experiments, we use category epitome, a recently proposed sketch-based spatial representation for objects. To enable part-importance analysis, we first obtain semantic-part annotations of hand-drawn sketches originally used to construct <b>the</b> <b>epitomes.</b> We then examine {{the extent to which the}} semantic-parts are present in <b>the</b> <b>epitomes</b> <b>of</b> a category and visualize the relative importance of parts as a word cloud. Finally, we show how such word cloud visualizations provide an intuitive understanding of category-level structural trends that exist in <b>the</b> category <b>epitome</b> object representations. Our method is general in applicability and can also be used to analyze part-based visual object representations for other depiction methods such as photographic images...|$|R
50|$|In 1973, most Americans {{commonly}} viewed gay men as effeminate narcissists too disturbed to be respectable {{members of}} society. Brown helped change that image.

50|$|The Periodos to Nicomedes {{was first}} {{published}} at Augsburg in 1600.

It continued to pass under his name until 1846 when Augustus Meineke, in republishing the extant fragments, showed clearly that there were no grounds for ascribing them to that writer. The real work of Scymnus of Chios appears to have been in prose and the few statements cited from him are not in accordance with those of Pseudo-Scymnus.|$|R
40|$|Al-Fārābī’s Book of Letters (Kitāb al-Ḥurūf) and the {{analyses}} devoted {{in this text}} to the terminology of ‘Being’ are authoritative references for Averroes from <b>the</b> <b>epitomes</b> <b>of</b> his youth to his mature treatises. Also the Farabian doctrine of the conventionality of the natural language {{plays a role in}} Averroes' thought. This paper discusses the Tahāfut al-Tahāfut, 371. 5 - 372. 12 Bouyges, where Averroes has recourse to the Book of Letters in criticizing Avicenna’s distinction between essence and existence. Averroes explicitly mentions the title of the work and recalls a passage from the fifteenth chapter. This passage had already inspired him in <b>the</b> <b>Epitome</b> on Metaphysics, where Averroes did not mention explicitly his source, but followed in al-Fārābī's footsteps as for the analysis of the uses of ‘being’. This was one of the points in Averroes' critique against Avicenna. Averroes uses tacitly the same passage also in his Commentary on Metaphysics Delta 7...|$|R
