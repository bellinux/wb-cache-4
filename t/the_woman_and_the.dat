25|$|Conventionally, {{caesarean}} sections {{are classified}} as being either an elective surgery or an emergency operation.

500|$|Helen McCullough {{describes}} Murasaki's {{writing as}} of universal appeal and believes The Tale of Genji [...] "transcends both its genre and age. Its basic {{subject matter and}} setting—love at the Heian court—{{are those of the}} romance, and its cultural assumptions are those of the mid-Heian period, but Murasaki Shikibu's unique genius has made the work for many a powerful statement of human relationships, the impossibility of permanent happiness in love... and the vital importance, in a world of sorrows, of sensitivity to the feelings of others." [...] Prince Genji recognizes in each of his lovers the inner beauty of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fragility of life, which according to Keene, makes him heroic. The story was popular: Emperor Ichijō had it read to him, even though it was written in Japanese.

[...] Although he did not think that most women want to be raped or are drawn to violence, he said that viewers [...] "are responding to the intensity of passion and an actor who lets you inside the torment. Some [...] believe they can be swept up in that passion and still turn it good. They think, 'With me, he'd be different. [...] The author of the article, Michael Logan, supported Malone's statements, and commented, [...] "Let's call a spade a spade. There is a large contingent of American female soap viewers who find something very attractive about rapists". [...] Hayward reported that many female viewers were furious that Logan had described them this way, and stated that their attraction to Todd was due to the skill of the actor portraying him.|$|E
