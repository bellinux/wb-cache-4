The first objective {{of this study was}} to determine if yellow endosperm lines derived from adapted x exotic backcrosses contain exotic alleles that are superior to the recurrent adapted parental line for yield and other agronomic traits in tropical environments. Thirteen exotic yellow maize inbred lines were crossed to an adapted orange line (KUSR) and the F 1 s were backcrossed to KUSR to generate the first backcrosses. Fifty BC 1 F 4 lines derived from these backcrosses and the recurrent parent were crossed to a common inbred tester (L 4001) to form <b>testcrosses,</b> which were evaluated at eight environments in Nigeria. <b>Testcrosses</b> of the BC-derived lines differed significantly for grain yield and other agronomic traits. Only two <b>testcrosses</b> yielded significantly less than L 4001 x KUSR, with the best 15 <b>testcrosses</b> producing between 289 and 1, 056 kg/ha more grain yield than L 4001 x KUSR. The best <b>testcrosses</b> were similar to or better than L 4001 x KUSR for other agronomic traits. The second objective {{of this study was to}} assess the extent of genetic diversity present among the BC-derived lines. We genotyped 46 BC-derived lines including KUSR and L 4001 with 10 AFLP primer pairs and found 491 polymorphic fragments. The average allelic diversity of the lines was 0. 30 +/- 0. 01. The genetic distance of each BC-derived line from KUSR ranged between 0. 49 and 0. 91. The average genetic distance for all pairs of the BC-derived lines was 0. 68 +/- 0. 004, varying from 0. 34 to 0. 92. The increased grain yield and genetic diversity observed in these studies provide evidence that exotic germplasm can contribute new alleles to expand the genetic base of tropical maize and develop high-yielding hybrids...|$|R

A total of 39 QTLs for six yield traits were detected, of which three were detected in all the datasets, ten were common to the RIL and <b>testcross</b> populations, six were common to the <b>testcross</b> and HMP, and 17, 2, and 1 were detected for RILs, testcrosses, and HMP, respectively. When a QTL was detected in both the RIL and <b>testcross</b> populations, the difference between TQ and IR 24 and that between Zh 9 A/TQ and Zh 9 A/IR 24 were always in the same direction, providing the potential to increase the yield of hybrids by increasing the yield of parental lines. Genetic action mode of the 39 QTLs was inferred by comparing their performances in RILs, testcrosses, and HMP. The genetic modes were additive for 17 QTLs, dominance for 12 QTLs, and overdominance for 10 QTLs.

40|$|Maize (Zea mays L.) {{is grown}} {{in a wide}} range of environments and altitudes worldwide. Maize has transitioned from open pollinated {{varieties}} to single cross hybrids over the last century. While maize production and genetic gain has increased, genetic diversity among U. S. maize hybrids has narrowed. Problems, such as insect pressure, diseases, and mycotoxins, present obstacles for breeders. One approach is to use exotic germplasm in breeding programs to provide useful, novel alleles for productivity, grain quality, and disease resistance. Little exotic germplasm has been used, because of lack of agronomic adaptation and problems with lodging, earliness, and tall plants in more temperate areas. Using exotic elite materials and evaluating them in targeted regions might increase success. Objectives of this research were: to characterize and evaluate agronomic adaptation and performance of Argentine commercial hybrids in the U. S., to evaluate semi-exotic <b>testcrosses</b> developed from semi adapted 100 % tropical lines and elite U. S. inbred LH 195, and to estimate response to aflatoxin contamination of Argentine hybrids and semi-exotic <b>testcrosses</b> under inoculation with Aspergillus flavus. Agronomic data was collected during 2004 in eleven Texas environments for Argentine hybrids, and eight Texas environments for semi-exotic <b>testcrosses.</b> Response to aflatoxin was measured in three southern Texas environments. U. S. commercial hybrids were used as checks. Significant differences among hybrids were observed for most environments and traits. In general, Argentine hybrids yielded lower, had lower 1000 kernel weights, and greater test weights than U. S. hybrids. Hybrids AX 889, AX 882 MG, and AX 890 MG were competitive with U. S. hybrids for grain yield and were stable across environments. Semi-exotic <b>testcrosses</b> had similar lodging and grain moisture percentages, heavier test weights and competitive grain yields compared with U. S. hybrids. Hybrid TX-LAMA 2002 - 9 - 2 -B/lH 195 had the highest overall grain yield mean for semi-exotic <b>testcrosses</b> and yielded better than two U. S. hybrids. Argentine hybrids had lower aflatoxin concentration than U. S. hybrids; several hybrids had less than 50 ng g- 1 aflatoxin. Semi-exotic <b>testcrosses</b> had reduced aflatoxin compared to U. S. hybrids, with several hybrids under 35 ng g- 1. These elite, exotic materials show promise for breeding programs, with competitiveness for grain yield, kernel traits, and reduced aflatoxin levels...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was to}} compare DH lines versus selfing lines for <b>testcross</b> performance. DH and single-seed descent (SSD) lines were produced from random S- 1 progenies of a broad-base population. For grain yield, kernel moisture, plant height, ear height and leaf length, the three population means were similar. Except for kernel moisture, the genetic variance of DH lines was nearly twice as high as the genetic variance of S- 1 families, as expected. On the other hand, genetic variance among SSD lines was only 1. 5 times higher than the genetic variance of S- 1 families. This lower variance could be due to a selection bias in the method of production of SSD lines. However, for all traits, heritability of SSD or DH lines was higher than heritability of S- 1 families. Epistasis effects in DH progenies were not significant. The consequence was a high correlation between S- 1 <b>testcross</b> progenies and DH or SSD <b>testcross</b> progenies, meaning that the S- 1 <b>testcross</b> value can be used to select the best families from which DH lines will be extracted. As a whole, the observed variation in DH lines appeared to be more in accordance with the observed variation among S- 1 families than with the observed variation among SSD lines...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDespite {{the great}} success {{achieved}} by the exploitation of heterosis in rice, the genetic basis of heterosis is still not well understood. We adopted an advanced-backcross breeding strategy to dissect the genetic basis of heterosis for yield and eight related traits. Four <b>testcross</b> (TC) populations with 228 <b>testcross</b> F 1 combinations were developed by crossing 57 introgression lines with four types of widely used male sterile lines using a North Carolina II mating design. Analysis of variance indicated {{that the effects of}} <b>testcross</b> F 1 combinations and their parents were significant or highly significant for most of the traits in both years, and all interaction effects with year were significant for most of the traits. Positive midparent heterosis (HMP) was observed for most traits in the four TC populations in the two years. The relative HMP levels for most traits varied from highly negative to highly positive. Sixty-two dominant-effect QTL were identified for HMP of the nine traits in the four TC populations in the two years. Of these, 22 QTL were also identified for the performance of <b>testcross</b> F 1. Most dominant-effect QTL could individually explain more than 10 % of the phenotypic variation. Four QTL clusters were observed including the region surrounding the RM 9 –RM 297 region on chromosome 1, the RM 110 –RM 279 –RM 8 –RM 5699 –RM 452 region on chromosome 2, the RM 5463 locus on chromosome 6 and the RM 1146 –RM 147 region on chromosome 10.

Reciprocal interstrain crosses show full fertility and viability. However, <b>testcrosses</b> to a third cytoplasmic type show highly significant, reproducible differences in the cytoplasmic systems of the selected strains. A direct relationship between teratological growth patterns {{and the degree of}} heterozygosity of cytoplasmic factors was observed.

Heterozygosity in the cytoplasmic system in <b>testcrosses</b> produced a broad spectrum of teratological growth patterns related to the degree of heterozygosity of the multiple factors present in the cytoplasm. Formal genetic crosses involving the selected strains show that teratological growth and cytoplasmic sterility, both partial and complete, are inherited through the germ plasm of the maternal parent.

A total of 475 genetically diverse spring-type canola pollinator lines were genotyped at 24, 403 single-copy, genome-wide SNP loci. In parallel, the 950 F 1 <b>testcross</b> combinations between the pollinators and two representative testers were evaluated {{for a number of}} important agronomic traits including seedling emergence, days to flowering, lodging, oil yield and seed yield along with essential seed quality characters including seed oil content and seed glucosinolate content.

Subpopulations were determined using multidimensional scaling and K-means clustering. Genomic prediction accuracy across the whole population was highest for seed oil content (0. 81) followed by oil yield (0. 75) and lowest for seedling emergence (0. 29).

The mapping populations included 254 F(10) recombinant inbred lines {{derived from a}} cross between Lemont (japonica) and Teqing (indica) and two BC and two <b>testcross</b> hybrid populations derived from crosses between the RILs and their parents plus two testers (Zhong 413 and IR 64). For both BY and GY, there was significant inbreeding depression detected in the RI population and {{a high level of}} heterosis in each of the BC and <b>testcross</b> hybrid populations. The mean performance of the BC or <b>testcross</b> hybrids was largely determined by their heterosis measurements. The hybrid breakdown (part of inbreeding depression) values of individual RILs were negatively associated with the heterosis measurements of their BC or <b>testcross</b> hybrids, indicating the partial genetic overlap of genes causing hybrid breakdown and heterosis in rice. A large number of epistatic QTL pairs and a few main-effect QTL were identified, which were responsible for > 65 % of the phenotypic variation of BY and GY in each of the populations with the former explaining a much greater portion of the variation. Two conclusions concerning the loci associated with inbreeding depression and heterosis in rice were reached from our results. First, most QTL associated with inbreeding depression and heterosis in rice appeared to be involved in epistasis. Second, most (approximately 90 %) QTL contributing to heterosis appeared to be overdominant. These observations tend to implicate epistasis and overdominance, rather than dominance, as the major genetic basis of heterosis in rice. The implications of our results in rice evolution and improvement are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Chorion {{genes of}} the inbred stock Ascoli have been {{localized}} to three linked clusters by analysis of <b>testcross</b> progeny. Electrophoretic variants screened by isoelectric focusing served as markers. The clusters are designated Ch 1, Ch 2, and Ch 3. The gene order is Ch 1 –Ch 2 –Ch 3 –Y, with relative map distances of approximately 0. 4 m. u. for Ch 1 – 2, 3. 3 ± 0. 9 m. u. for Ch 2 – 3, and 21 m. u. for Ch 3 -Y.

40|$|The general {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the potential for selection of maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes that produce grain resistant to physical injury. The materials evaluated were S 1 and S 2 lines derived from BS 17 and BS 1 (HS) C 1 and S 2 lines derived from BS 1 (HS) C 1 in hybrid combinations with B 73 and MO 17. Eight plant and grain traits (kernel shear strength, visual endosperm rating, date of anthesis, harvest moisture, grain breakage, 300 -kernel weight, 300 -kernel volume, and kernel density) were evaluated for the S 1 and S 2 lines from BS 17 and BS 1 (HS) C 1. Also, five plant and grain traits (root lodging, stalk lodging, grain breakage, harvest moisture, and grain yield) of BS 1 (HS) C 1 S 2 lines and S 2 line <b>testcross</b> hybrids were evaluated. All materials were grown at two locations, one year for each generation (visual endosperm rating and date of anthesis were evaluated only at Ames);Statistical analyses revealed significant genetic variability in BS 17 and BS 1 (HS) C 1 for all traits. Estimated genotype-by-environment variance components for physical grain quality traits were 0 to 66 % as large as the estimated genotypic variance components. Heritability estimates (entry mean basis) for grain breakage ranged from 0. 48 to 0. 67. Nonadditive gene action for grain breakage was indicated by a highly significant S 2 line-by-tester interaction. Because the means of S 2 lines and S 2 line <b>testcross</b> hybrids for grain breakage were similar in magnitude, the presence of nonadditive gene action may be the consequence of bi-directional dominance;The optimum harvest moisture range for physical grain quality preservation was 19 to 26 %. Increasing deviations from this optimum range resulted in increasing grain breakage. Grain resistant to breakage tended to be smaller, denser, and higher in shear strength. Correlations of the same traits between generations indicated that S 1 and S 2 line means would have predictive value for S 2 line and S 2 line <b>testcross</b> hybrid means, respectively. The data indicated that selection of S 1 lines with breakage-resistant grain would result in earlier flowering S 2 lines with smaller kernels. A small, positive correlation between S 2 line grain breakage and S 2 line <b>testcross</b> hybrid yield revealed that selection of S 2 lines with superior physical grain quality could result in lower yielding S 2 line <b>testcross</b> hybrids...|$|E
40|$|Combining ability {{estimation}} {{are important}} genetic attributes for maize breeders in anticipating improvement in productivity via hybridization and selection. Maize exhibits heterosis for all traits {{and the extent}} of heterosis is significantly variable depending on the choice of parents and the trait(s) measured. We developed hundreds of S 2 lines in 2009 and out of these S 2 lines, several selected lines were crossed with three different testers in three isolations to generate <b>testcrosses</b> (spring 2010). The <b>testcrosses</b> were evaluated in a partial lattice square design with two replications to divulge combining ability and heterosis for particular traits of economic importance (summer- 2010). Phenotypic data were recorded for flowering time, morphological traits and total yield to calculate total variability, combining abilities and mid parent (MPH) and better parent (BPH) heterosis. The 87 <b>testcrosses</b> possessed highly significant differences (P ≤ 0. 01) for the investigated traits. Proportional contribution of lines, tester and their interaction to the total variability for anthesis silking interval (ASI) was 38. 33, 2. 34 and 59. 33 %, respectively. Means yield ranged from 2547. 45 to 9842. 02 kg ha- 1. Maximum yield was observed for CMI- 76, using OPV Jalal as a tester, while minimum yield was detected for CMI- 190 - 2, using WD 3 x 6 as a tester. In general, tester parent OPV Jalal showed better heterotic effect with each line as compared to other testers. Based on these results we conclude that maize unveiled excessive ability for heterotic expression, even several inbred line...|$|R
40|$|Numerous open-pollinated maize (Zea mays L.) accessions are {{maintained}} {{in the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s gene banks. These accessions need to be evaluated, particularly for quantitative traits, {{but they tend to}} be adapted only to specific environments. Temperate maize accessions may contain new alleles {{that can be used for}} maize improvement in the U. S. Corn Belt. <b>Testcrossing</b> unadapted populations to a series of testers has been proposed as an evaluation method. This study compared the ranking of temperate unadapted populations via <b>testcrosses</b> with eight testers consisting of broad-based populations, single crosses, and inbred lines. Also, the accessions were evaluated per se. Agronomic performance of the testers is important in their use. Testers B 14 xB 37, B 14, Oh 43, and Mo 17 had non-significant environmental interactions for grain yield. Inbred line tester B 37 was a poor pollen producer. Broad-based testers BS 13 and BS 26 had the highest root lodging while testers B 14 xB 37 and B 14 had the lowest stalk lodging. Similarities were observed in ranking of some accessions by the testers for grain yield but extreme differences occurred in the ranks of other accessions. Inbred lines Oh 43 and Mo 17 and single crosses B 14 xB 37 and Oh 43 xMo 17 ranked several accessions in the opposite order for grain yield. Accession per se evaluation also showed extreme differences in ranking when compared to the <b>testcrosses.</b> Less extreme differences in ranking the accessions were evident for root and stalk lodging. Factor analysis was used on the rank correlation matrices in an attempt to further explain the differences in ranking among the testers and accession per se evaluation. One approach was to use factor analysis to compare testers and accessions per se for a single trait. Another approach analyzed each set of <b>testcrosses</b> or accessions per se for all traits and then compared factor loadings across all sets. Neither of these methods were effective in determining which tester or group of testers ranked the accessions differentially. Differences observed in ranking the populations were not extreme enough for factor analysis to detect...|$|R
40|$|Quality Protein Maize (QPM) {{with the}} mutant gene opaque- 2 (o 2), has higher lysine and {{tryptophan}} content and hard endosperm {{which is less}} susceptible to mechanical and biological damage. Three experiments were conducted to characterize the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of high lysine maize. In the first experiment two separate diallels including 7 white and 9 yellow QPM inbreds were evaluated in five southern USA environments to estimate the general (GCA) and specific combining abilities (SCA) for grain yield and to identify potential heterotic relationships among them. QPM hybrids yielded less than commercial checks. GCA effects across environments were non-significant for grain yield but highly significant for secondary traits. Best yielding hybrids resulted from crosses among inbreds from different programs (CIMMYT, Mexico; University of Natal, South Africa and TAMU, USA). In the second experiment <b>testcrosses</b> between QPM inbreds and Tx 804, were evaluated for agronomic performance, aflatoxin resistance and quality. QPM inbreds in <b>testcrosses</b> have similar flowering dates, plant height, ear height and test weights but lower grain yield than normal checks. Population 69 inbreds and their <b>testcrosses</b> were least susceptible to aflatoxin. Aflatoxin in <b>testcrosses</b> {{was positively correlated with}} endosperm texture (0. 67) and kernel integrity (0. 60) but negatively correlated with grain yield (- 0. 30) and silking date (- 0. 50). Tryptophan content was negatively correlated with endosperm modification. Amino acid levels of inbred lines were significantly correlated with those of hybrids, but with low predictive value. In the third experiment 92 high lysine maize inbreds with different origins [Stiff Stalk, Non Stiff Stalk, Pop 69, temperate (Tx 802, Tx 804, Tx 806, B 97, B 104) and exotic subtropical lines (CML 161, Do 940 y and Ko 326 y) ] were haplotyped on a cM scale utilizing 43 mapped SSR markers to characterize genetic diversity on chromosome 7, estimate linkage disequilibrium around opaque- 2 locus and determine the parental contribution in some inbreds. Dendrograms of genetic similarity showed clusters in agreement with the different origin of inbreds. A total of 200 alleles were detected with an average of 4. 7 alleles/locus. Significant linkage disequilibrium was detected around opaque- 2 locus. Parental contributions of haplotypes showed segments of chromosome 7 exclusively contributed by one or the other parent...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- Successful {{prediction}} of hybrid performance (HP) {{is an attractive}} alternative to expensive field testing for identification of superior hybrids and can greatly accel-erate hybrid breeding programs. In combination with the doubled-haploid technology, which has greatly facilitated the development of maize lines, HP prediction based on molecular markers has gained importance in recent years. Here, we review the methods for HP {{prediction of}} single-crosses between heterotic groups. These methods are based on line per se performance, general combining abili-ty, best linear unbiased prediction, genetic distances, and genetic effects estimated from molecular markers. We con-sider marker-based HP prediction {{with a focus on}} the use of doubled-haploid lines and discuss its application for three stages in hybrid breeding programs: (1) after field evaluation of experimental hybrids, (2) after field evalua-tion of <b>testcross</b> performance, and (3) before field evalua-tion of <b>testcross</b> performance. Types of hybrids, whose performance is to be predicted, are those having two (Type 2), one (Type 1), or no (Type 0) parental lines that are already evaluated for <b>testcross</b> performance. Various studies in maize indicate that efficiency of HP prediction depends not only on the prediction approach and the ac-tual experimental data, but also on the type of hybrids. Fi-nally, we present an outlook on the future of HP predic-tion, with a focus on the integration of high-throughput genotyping platforms in hybrid breeding programs...|$|E

40|$|Aflatoxins are potent {{carcinogens}} {{produced by}} the fungus Aspergillus flavus Link:Fr and are a significant preharvest problem in maize production in Texas, the southern US, and subtropical climates. Several sources of maize germplasm are available which reduce preharvest aflatoxin accumulation, {{but many of these}} sources lack agronomic performance for direct use as a parent in commercial hybrids. Tropical germplasm is a source of both resistance to aflatoxin accumulation resistance and agronomic performance traits. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate germplasm for traits to reduce preharvest aflatoxin accumulation. The specific objectives of this research were: 1) to validate QTL estimates previously identified in lines per se and estimate new QTL associated with reduced aflatoxin accumulations and agronomic traits; 2) to evaluate agronomic characteristics of selections from a RIL population in testcrosses at multiple locations across Texas; and (3) to release agronomically desirable germplasm sources with reduced risk to preharvest aflatoxin accumulation. A total of 96 QTLs were detected across fourteen measured traits using an RIL population of 130 individuals in <b>testcross</b> hybrids evaluated in five environments. Three QTL detected in per se analyses were also detected in hybrid testcrosses. Previously unreported QTL were detected on chromosomes 3, 4, 8 and 9. Within each of the two years, neither subset of the RIL <b>testcross</b> hybrids produced grain yields equal to commercial hybrid checks in these trials, but one <b>testcross</b> in 2008 produced grain yield within 10 percent of commercial check hybrids and in 2009, five RIL testcrosses produced grain yield within 17 percent of the commercial check hybrids. Although RIL testcrosses did not yield more than the commercial checks, they will be a source of germplasm for reduced aflatoxin. Improved sources of maize germplasm lines Tx 736, Tx 739, and Tx 740 have been selected for adaptation to southern US and Texas growing environments with traits that reduce aflatoxin accumulation. Each of the lines in <b>testcross</b> accumulated significantly fewer aflatoxins than commercial hybrids in the trial...|$|E

The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop a theory to compare {{the efficiency of}} segregating generations and <b>testcrosses</b> from the cross of two inbred lines differing in value for a quantitative trait (P(1) X P(2)) for estimating additive, dominance and heterotic effects of QTLs by stepwise regression. An equation that predicts the smallest gene effect in genetic standard deviation units that can be detected with 50 % chance at a significance level as a function of the heritability (h(2)) and the recombination frequency (r) of markers was developed for the segregating generations and <b>testcrosses.</b> For estimating additive effects, the most efficient generation was the doubled-haploid (DH) lines; the most inefficient was the North Carolina Design III (NCD III), followed by selfed backcrosses (SB); the selfed families from F(2) individual plants (F(2 : 3) lines) are inferior to the recombinant inbreds (RI) for low r, but are better than RI for high h(2) and r. Dominance effects are less efficiently estimated than additive effects. The NCD III is better than the SB and the F(2 : 3) lines for detecting dominance effects. The RI and DH do not estimate dominance effects. The differential heterotic QTL effects of lines P(1) and P(2) when crossed with tester T can be estimated by evaluating <b>testcrosses</b> of individual F(2) plants (F 2 T), recombinant inbreds (RIT) and double-haploid lines (DHT).

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{effectively}} use population identification methods to improve elite single crosses would allow breeders to concentrate resources on populations known to carry new favorable alleles, thus enhancing breeding success. The {{value of a}} population for improvement of a single cross {{is determined by the}} relative number of dominant alleles contained in the population at loci that are homozygous recessive in the single cross (Class ℯ loci). This study was conducted to compare population identification methods for their ability to rank maize (Zea mays L.) populations for number of dominant alleles at Class ℯ loci. The methods were evaluated by using populations of known genetic composition. The methods evaluated included,, upper bound (UBND), <b>testcrossing</b> to a single cross (TCSC), <b>testcrossing</b> to an inbred line, and performance per se. Estimates provided by and UBND had the largest correlations with the genetic structure of the populations for grain yield, ear height, and silking date. Rank correlation coefficients between estimates of and UBND pooled across single crosses were 0. 98 for grain yield, 0. 99 for ear height, and 0. 99 for silking date. The pooled rank correlation coefficients between and percentage favorable parent were negative for grain yield and silking date. Pooled rank correlations between and and between and UBND also were negative. In some instances, the population expected to be most favorable was identified by <b>testcrosses</b> to an inbred parent of the single cross.
