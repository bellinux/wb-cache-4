Fritz, a film based on a character created by artist and illustrator Robert Crumb, was the first animated movie to receive an X rating in the United States. Charles Swenson developed Down and Dirty Duck as a project for former The Mothers of Invention band members Kaylan and Volman under <b>the</b> <b>title</b> Cheap! Had the film been released under this title, as director Mick Garris notes, <b>the</b> <b>title</b> would have been Roger Corman's Cheap! However, Roger Corman observed <b>the</b> <b>title</b> as a shot at his production techniques, and asked that <b>the</b> <b>title</b> be changed. The film's production budget was $110,000. According to Swenson, he created {{almost all of the}} animation himself, although publicity attributed the animation work to the Murakami-Wolf Production Company, with Academy Award Winning animator Fred Wolf, credited as his son's name, Bill Wolf, helped animate parts of the film personally. Although the film was promoted as an X-rated animated film, New World Pictures had not actually submitted it to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). The film was also promoted as Dirty Duck, although <b>the</b> <b>title</b> on the film itself reads Down and Dirty Duck.|$|E
