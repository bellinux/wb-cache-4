40|$|Induction motor {{manufacturers}} {{have long known}} that substitution of copper for diecast aluminum in the rotor squirrel cage would significantly reduce motor losses and improve the electrical energy efficiency. Aluminum is readily die-cast to produce the complex squirrel cage within and around the iron laminations of the rotor. Copper is much more difficult <b>to</b> <b>die-cast</b> due to its high melting temperature which leads to premature die failure. The work reported here addresses the die life problem in die casting electrical grade copper. A number of candidate high temperature die materials were surveyed. Computer simulation of the cyclic thermal and stress gradients in dies provided insight into the “heat checking ” failure mechanism and how it could be minimized or avoided. A nickel-base alloy die system preheated to and operated at ~ 625 °C has been developed and shown to greatly extend die life compared to die steels operated conventionally. A die insert heating and insulation system was developed to make extended runs possible. Copper motor rotors were die cast over a range of machine operating parameters in joint effort with several motor manufacturers. Motor test result...|$|E

40|$|Laser Shock Processing (LSP) is {{a process}} of laser {{treatment}} with a pulsed beam of high-power density. The process generates locally limited mechanical waves that increase the through-depth density of dislocations. This entails a change in mechanical properties, particularly at the workpiece surface. The treatment with laser-induced shock waves is suitable for structural parts and machine elements subjected to high thermo-dynamical loads. LSP can substantially improve the wear resistance, which is of exceptional significance <b>to</b> <b>die-casting</b> tools made of maraging steel. The paper describes the effects of LSP on chosen 12 % Ni maraging steel, which is suitable also for the manufacture of tools for die casting of aluminium alloys.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effect of}} renitriding for hot work die steel. We noticed a decrease of compressive residual stress on the nitrided die surface during thermal fatigue process. X-ray stress measurement was used to detect the decomposition of nitride layer on hot work die steel (H 13). As a result, compressive residual stress decreased gradually during the thermal fatigue test, almost restoring to the pre-test level by renitriding. The number of cracks decreased with the frequency of test by surface removal effect of shot peening while renitriding. Comparing the renitrided specimen with non renitrided specimen (single nitride), the number of cracks had decreased. On the surface of hot work die, such as die-casting die, heat cycles are applied during the operation. Then, the cracks occurred due to thermal stresses caused by thermal cycles. <b>To</b> extend <b>die-casting</b> die life, nitriding is often applied to the die surface 1).

40|$|In {{die-casting}} molds, heat-checking is {{the typical}} failure mechanism. Optimizing the parameters that decrease this failure venture {{should be considered}} when designing and heat treating steels. The quality of die steels and their treatment continue to improve. This research investigated properties of the traditional materials 1. 2343 and 1. 2344 and the new steels (Dievar and TOOLOX 44) when applied <b>to</b> the <b>die-casting</b> mold specimens, after different experimental cycles. Also microstructures of the mentioned materials were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) test. Chrome-molybdenum-silicon-vanadium steels have good hardening ability in oil and in air.

40|$|Magnesium and its alloys exhibit {{not only}} elastic and plastic {{behaviour}} but also anelastic behaviour upon loading. The presence of anelastic strain poses {{a challenge to}} the measurement of proof stress using conventional methods. As such, the proof stress measurement methods specified by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and International Standards Organization (ISO) are reviewed and applied <b>to</b> three common <b>die-cast</b> magnesium alloys including AE 44, AM 60 and AZ 91. The methods in the standards give inconsistent results due largely to the inherent anelastic behaviour of these alloys. The widely used 0. 2 % offset strain method tends to underestimate proof stress while the 0. 2 % permanent plastic strain method requires repeated loading and unloading. In {{view of the fact that}} the non-equivalence between the offset strain and the residual plastic strain for magnesium alloys is a key obstacle to the accurate proof stress measurement, a conversion chart is constructed to enable the determination of the appropriate offset strain for a desired residual plastic strain for a range of magnesium alloys.

Scatter behavior of pore size observed at fracture nucleation site on the fracture surface was comparable to that observed on the specimen cross-section and also to that of fatigue life. Therefore, the dominant factor for large scatter of fatigue life in die-cast alloys would be the large scatter of pore size.

40|$|Defects and {{imperfections}} are intrinsically {{generated by}} casting processes, due to several reasons. The final properties and in-service behaviour of castings are always related to microstructural features and to defects and imperfections: both microstructure and defects/imperfections {{are the results}} of process stages, alloys properties and dies & tools design. As an example, it should be considered that in HPDC filling stage extreme conditions are established: complexity of components leads to complex dies, and the high production rates required (up to 120 shots/h) lead to very high filling velocities for the molten alloy (up to 40 m/s) with strong generation of turbulence in the flow. Solidification takes place in few seconds, and the die is first in contact with a molten alloy at more than 700 °C and, after 30 - 40 seconds, with a sprayed lubricant at room temperature. For these reasons HPDC (as well as other Aluminium alloys casting processes, such as permanent mould casting process) {{can be considered a}} “defect generating process”. Not only an average 5 - 10 % scrap is typically produced, but the type, size and severity of defects and imperfections are varying. From these considerations, it seems that the potential of high-pressure die-casting and permanent mould casting processes will be completely exploited only when the quality level will be perfectly optimised. In this regard, the analysis of defects and imperfections allows the foundry to monitor the products quality respect to a quality standard. Further, the analysis of defects and imperfections provide to the foundry useful correlations between their type/distribution and their origin, so that it could be possible to define process modification for improving the quality. One of the current targets of the StaCast project is the compilation and dissemination of common tools to allow foundries to define a proper, comparable, quality standard. The first tool to be proposed is a common basis of language, i. e. a terminology and classification of defects and imperfections in order <b>to</b> help <b>die-casting</b> foundries <b>to</b> face with increased confidence and ability the defect-related issues, to assure quality and reliability of their products...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The main {{objective}} of the paper {{was to investigate the}} structure and corrosion properties of amorphous and crystalline Mg-based alloys for biodegradable implants. This paper presents a preparation method and the structure, microhardness and corrosion properties characterization of Mg 70 Zn 30 and Mg 66 Zn 30 Ca 4 alloys in the form of plates. Design/methodology/approach: The studied samples were prepared by the pressure <b>die-casting</b> <b>to</b> copper mould. The structure of the both alloys was examined by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The thermal properties of the samples were examined using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). In addition, corrosion properties research (immersion tests) were performed in a physiological fluid. Microhardness was measured using the Vickers microtester. Findings: The results of X-ray diffraction investigations confirmed that the sample of Mg 66 Zn 30 Ca 4 alloy is amorphous and sample of Mg 70 Zn 30 alloy has crystalline structure. Immersion tests of both samples have shown homogeneous progress of corrosion. The changes of a structure caused by calcium addition resulted in an increase of microhardness for sample Mg 66 Zn 30 Ca 4 compared with the sample of Mg 70 Zn 30 alloy. Research limitations/implications: Results of immersion tests are dependent of used fluid. In this paper used physiological (multielectrolyte) fluid to corrosion studies, which composition is similar to the electrolyte composition of the blood plasma. Chemical composition of fluid used in corrosion studies could be affected to results of studies. Therefore it is appropriate to carry out comparative studies such as electrochemical corrosion studies. Practical implications: Mg-based alloys can be applied as the medical implants. The chemical composition of the samples Mg 66 Zn 30 Ca 4 and Mg 70 Zn 30 was chosen, because they meet the requirements of a biodegradable material, that is, material, which after completing their stability function will dissolve {{in the body of the}} patient without the harmful effects on health.
