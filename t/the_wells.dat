5|$|Balch was {{a founder}} member of <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> Natural History and Archaeological Society, using his {{connections}} at Wells Cathedral to organise lectures. It {{was through the}} society and with help of Thomas Jex-Blake, Dean of Wells, that Balch managed to set up <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> Museum in 1893, displaying his own artefacts in the cathedral's cloister. The museum had grown significantly by 1928 so Balch persuaded William Wyndham to purchase a property for the museum on the cathedral green. In 1932, the museum was relocated to the cathedral green, eventually becoming <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> and Mendip Museum. He remained honorary curator of <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> Museum throughout his life.|$|E
5|$|Balch became {{interested}} in stratigraphy and cave archaeology after attending a talk by William Boyd Dawkins. Balch led much of the exploration through the caves near Wookey Hole village, discovering and mapping many caves. He also made discoveries of artefacts used {{by the people who}} lived in the caves during the Iron Age. Balch was a founder member of <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> Natural History and Archaeology Society and through the society he founded <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> Museum, largely including his own collection of artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Exploratory {{drilling}} for geothermal power occurred near the Mono Craters {{on the south}} shore of Mono Lake in 1971. <b>The</b> <b>wells</b> did not show promising results, so the effort was abandoned.|$|E
30|$|After normal shut in of <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> {{asphaltene}} {{deposition in}} the porous media near <b>the</b> <b>well</b> bore is possible.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>well</b> {{was built}} in 1459 by the {{followers}} of Hang Li Poh as the main water source in the town. After conquering Malacca in 1511, the Portuguese secured <b>the</b> <b>well</b> and used it as their main water source supply. After conquering Malacca in 1677, the Dutch surrounded <b>the</b> <b>well</b> with solid brick walls to protect <b>the</b> <b>well.</b> However, during <b>the</b> British period, they neglected <b>the</b> <b>well</b> and let it fall into despair.|$|R

5|$|In 1987, Canadian {{volcanologist}} Catherine Hickson {{revealed that}} <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> Gray-Clearwater volcanic field {{is not part}} of the Anahim Volcanic Belt, but rather a separate centre that most likely represents an area of lithospheric decompression melting caused by rifting along pre-existing crustal fractures. <b>The</b> <b>Wells</b> Gray-Clearwater volcanic field has since not been considered part of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and the Anahim hotspot is now believed to be in the area of Nazko Cone.|$|E
5|$|In {{those with}} {{suspected}} DVT, a clinical assessment of probability {{can be useful}} to determine which tests to perform. The most studied clinical prediction rule is <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> score.|$|E
30|$|When <b>the</b> <b>well</b> is {{operated}} with BPR on the casing, {{the decision making}} process, {{in an attempt to}} optimize <b>the</b> <b>well</b> production, is more intense than the situation without BPR. Especially if the history of <b>the</b> <b>well</b> shows downhole sand problems, a close study of <b>the</b> <b>well</b> and reservoir behavior is required.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>well</b> had a visitor's center {{detailing}} {{the history of}} <b>the</b> <b>well's</b> construction. On May 4, 2007, a tornado hit Greensburg, destroying the center. [...] <b>The</b> <b>well</b> reopened on May 26, 2012.|$|R
50|$|Drilled at a {{site called}} Pelican Portage, <b>the</b> <b>well</b> blew out at 235 metres after encountering a {{high-pressure}} gas zone. According to drilling contractor A.W. Fraser,Fraser's crew unsuccessfully tried to kill <b>the</b> <b>well</b> by casing it, then abandoned <b>the</b> <b>well</b> for that year. They returned in 1898 to finish the job, but again they failed. In the end, they simply left <b>the</b> <b>well</b> blowing wild. Natural gas flowed from <b>the</b> <b>well</b> {{at a rate of}} some 250,000 cubic metres per day until 1918. In that year a crew led by geologist S.E. Slipper and C.W. Dingman finally shut in <b>the</b> <b>well.</b>|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, the {{building}} {{became known as}} the Wachovia Building. Wachovia became the building's largest tenant after merging with First Union Corporation early in the decade. In 2006, Wachovia re-negotiated its lease, which was set to expire in 2010. After exploring other potential new office space in Center City, Wachovia made a deal to stay in the Wachovia Building along with the neighboring Witherspoon Building, the nearby One South Broad, and the Widener Building until the 2020s. The building became known as <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> Fargo Building after Wells Fargo, which bought Wachovia in 2008, re-branded Wachovia area banks in April 2011. Wells Fargo marketed the change by having a stagecoach carrying Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter and others ride from Philadelphia City Hall to <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> Fargo Building.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the US Bank Stadium began construction. It is to cost {{over one}} {{billion dollars in}} construction, and will be {{completed}} in 2016.

50|$|According to {{the legend}} of Cormac mac Art, <b>the</b> <b>well</b> stands in <b>the</b> hall of the fairy king Manannán mac Lir. In one legend, <b>the</b> <b>well</b> was home to the one Salmon of Wisdom until it was caught by the poet Finn Eces. Nine sacred hazels of wisdom {{surround}} <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> blooming and fruiting in the same hour. Eating the hazelnuts that fell into <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> drinking <b>the</b> <b>well</b> water when <b>the</b> hazelnuts fell in, or eating the salmon that ate the hazelnuts granted knowledge and poetic inspiration. <b>The</b> <b>well</b> was accordingly sought out by many poets and philosophers.|$|R

50|$|As {{the water}} flows into <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> <b>the</b> water levels or {{pressure}} in the aquifer around <b>the</b> <b>well</b> decrease. <b>The</b> amount of this decline becomes less with distance from <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> resulting in a cone-shaped depression radiating away from <b>the</b> <b>well.</b> This, in appearance, {{is similar to the}} effect one sees when the plug is pulled from a bathtub. This conical-shaped feature is the cone of depression.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>well</b> {{has been}} <b>the</b> {{subject of a}} popular pilgrimage {{since at least the}} 1830s, when {{following}} a personal cure which he attributed to the waters of <b>the</b> <b>well,</b> Cornelius O'Brien had <b>the</b> <b>well</b> house built.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Wells</b> Gray-Clearwater {{volcanic}} {{field is}} one of the 10 volcanic areas in Canada associated with recent seismic activity; the others are Castle Rock, Mount Edziza, Mount Cayley, Hoodoo Mountain, The Volcano, Crow Lagoon, Mount Meager, Mount Garibaldi and Nazko Cone. Seismic data suggests that these volcanoes still contain living magma plumbing systems, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data does not allow a clear conclusion, these observations are further indications that some of Canada's volcanoes are potentially active, and that their associated hazards may be significant. Beneath areas of monogenetic cinder cone activity, such as <b>the</b> <b>Wells</b> Gray-Clearwater volcanic field, the seismicity appears to be more dispersed. In a few cases earthquakes are clustered in time and space, suggestive of volcanic earthquake swarms.|$|E
50|$|A well is {{initially}} drilled and completed {{under the control}} of the drilling and completions department operating under the request of the asset. Once <b>the</b> <b>well</b> is completed, control is transferred to the asset's production team, who will operate <b>the</b> <b>well</b> as appropriate for their purposes. Should any issues of well integrity or any requirement for <b>well</b> work arise, <b>the</b> asset will refer the issue to <b>the</b> <b>well</b> services. During interventions, control of affected well is handed over from production to <b>the</b> <b>well</b> services crew at <b>the</b> <b>well</b> site, a practical action involving transferring control lines from the production control panel to <b>the</b> <b>well</b> services control panel.|$|R
5000|$|On September 10, Allen {{said the}} bottom kill could start sooner than {{expected}} because a [...] "locking sleeve" [...] {{could be used}} on top of <b>the</b> <b>well</b> to prevent excessive pressure from causing problems. BP said <b>the</b> relief <b>well</b> was about 50 ft from the intersection, and finishing the boring would take four more days. [...] On September 16, <b>the</b> relief <b>well</b> reached its destination and pumping of cement to seal <b>the</b> <b>well</b> began. Officials said on September 18 that the cement pumped in {{from the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>well</b> had completed <b>the</b> sealing of <b>the</b> <b>well.</b> On September 19, after pressure testing, Allen declared <b>the</b> <b>well</b> [...] "officially dead".|$|R
50|$|Aquifers {{are also}} an {{important}} source for the groundwater that feeds into <b>wells.</b> <b>The</b> groundwater must go through these aquifers to get to <b>the</b> <b>well.</b> However, <b>the</b> <b>well</b> {{has an effect on}} <b>the</b> aquifers as <b>well.</b> Pumping through much water through these wells can cause a cone of depression around <b>the</b> <b>well.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Wells</b> {{ideas and}} attitudes now strike many readers as dated, and few critics praise its {{literary}} quality.
