5|$|Chess is a two-player {{board game}} {{utilizing}} a chessboard and sixteen pieces of six types for each player. Each type of piece moves in a distinct way. The {{goal of the}} game is to checkmate (threaten with unescapable capture) the opponent's king. Games do not necessarily end with checkmate; players often resign if <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> will lose. A game can also end in a draw in several ways.|$|E
5|$|After Jacob's death, the Monster tells Ben {{to fetch}} Richard, {{as he wants}} to speak to him. However, when Ben exits the statue, Richard throws him down beside the corpse of the real John Locke, which has {{been brought to the}} statue by {{survivors}} of the Ajira flight, led by Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson). Ben is forced by Ilana's group to bring them to the imposter Locke. They start shooting at the Monster, but he disappears, then returns in its black smoke form, killing Ilana's group. The Monster returns to Locke's form and mockingly informs Ben of the real Locke's last thoughts, while being strangled by Ben. Afterwards, Ben comforts Ilana when he finds her crying in Jacob's chamber and sets off with her, Sun, and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) to bury Locke before going to the Temple, where <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> will be safe from the Monster. At Locke's funeral, Ben provides the eulogy, and expresses his sincere apologies for killing Locke. When they arrive at the Temple, the Monster is destroying the place. They return to the beach as a temporary shelter, and Ben attempts to make amends with everyone for killing Jacob. Ilana then forces him to dig a grave and explains she will kill Ben for murdering her father figure. Later, the Monster visits Ben, telling him to join him and then magically frees Ben. After Ben escapes, Ilana chases after him, and the two come face-to-face at the jungle when Ben points a rifle at her. Ben explains to her why he really killed Jacob, particularly grieving his daughter. Ilana understands and allows him to rejoin their group, which he does. Hurley, Jack, and Richard show up and join their group, then have a meeting, deciding what to do next. Richard suggests they should stop the Monster escaping by blowing up the Ajira plane. After Hurley destroys the available dynamite from the shipwrecked Black Rock, Richard insists he will find other explosives. Ben and Miles join Richard, while the rest decide to go talk to the Monster. When Ben, Richard and Miles arrive at the Barracks, Widmore is there, and is soon joined by the Monster. Ben murders Widmore before he is able to make a deal with the Monster to spare his daughter. The Monster and Ben find Desmond and the Monster forces him to go destroy the Island. They run into Jack's group and they both go {{to the heart of the}} Island, where Desmond removes the cork of the Island, causing the Island to begin collapsing. After Jack kills the Monster, Ben and Hurley volunteer to stay behind on the Island with Jack to assist him relighting the Island. Jack tells them he will die doing this and Jack gives Hurley the new position of being protector of the Island. Ben advises him to approach his Island duties with his kindness and helpful attitude. Hurley asks Ben to become his advisor, to which he is honored. After an undisclosed period of time, Ben, on orders from Hurley, arrives at the Dharma Logistics Warehouse in Guam. He speaks to the two workers there and instructs them that the facility is being shut down. Afterward, Ben arrives at the Santa Rosa Mental Hospital and visits Walt. Ben tells him that he is still special and that he can help his father, Michael, even though he is dead, and offers Walt a job to return to the island.|$|E

25|$|Cosmetic {{reasons for}} {{modification}} of the female genitalia {{may be due to}} FGM, voluntary cosmetic operations, or surgery for intersex conditions. There are two main categories of women seeking cosmetic genital surgery: those with congenital conditions (such as an intersex condition), and those with no underlying condition who experience physical discomfort or wish to alter the appearance of their genitals because <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> do not fall within a normal range.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{interested}} in exploring adolescent sexuality using this perspective typically investigates how gender, race, culture, socioeconomic status {{and sexual orientation}} affect how adolescent understand their own sexuality. An example of how gender affects sexuality is when young adolescent girls state that they believe sex is a method used to maintain relationships when boys are emotionally unavailable. Because they are girls, <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> ought to engage in sexual behavior in order to please their boyfriends.|$|E

25|$|Labiaplasty (also {{known as}} labioplasty, labia minora reduction, and labial reduction) is a plastic surgery {{procedure}} for altering the labia minora (inner labia) and the labia majora (outer labia), {{the folds of}} skin surrounding the human vulva. There are two main categories of women seeking cosmetic genital surgery: those with congenital conditions such as intersex, and those with no underlying condition who experience physical discomfort or wish to alter the appearance of their genitals because <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> do not fall within a normal range.|$|E
25|$|A {{couple and}} their adult son and two adult daughters {{live in a}} fenced compound. The {{children}} {{have no knowledge of}} the outside world; their parents say they will be ready to leave once they lose a dogtooth, and that one can only leave safely by car. The children entertain themselves with endurance games, such as holding their hands under hot water. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> have a brother {{on the other side of}} the fence to whom they throw supplies.

25|$|People {{tend to be}} more optimistically biased when <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> {{have more}} control over events than others. For example, {{people are more likely to}} think that they will not be harmed in a car {{accident}} if they are driving the vehicle. Another example is that if someone believes that they have a lot of control over becoming infected with HIV, they are more likely to view their risk of contracting the disease to be low. Studies have suggested that the greater perceived control someone has, the greater their optimistic bias. Stemming from this, control is a stronger factor when it comes to personal risk assessments, but not when assessing others.|$|E

25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> are better off than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be. This also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E

500|$|Although physical, {{psychological}} and emotional factors militate {{to reduce the}} frequency of sex after injury, it increases after time. As years go by, the odds that a person will become involved in a sexual relationship increase. Difficulties adjusting to a changed appearance and physical limitations contribute to reduced frequency of sexual acts, and improved body image is associated with an increase. Like frequency, sexual desire and sexual satisfaction often decrease after SCI. The reduction in women's sexual desire and frequency may be in part because <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> can no longer enjoy sex, or because their independence or social opportunities are reduced. As time goes by people usually adjust sexually, adapting to their changed bodies. Some 80% of women return to being sexually active, ...|$|E

The creation and evolution of the universe is observed and recorded, and the Typhon will not tolerate this telling.
