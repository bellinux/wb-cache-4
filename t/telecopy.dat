40|$|Conditions on the {{perimeter}} of a forest fire {{can be obtained by}} use of airborne remote sensing techniques demonstrated by Ames Research Center. An Ames U- 2 high-altitude survey aircraft served as an aerial fire observation system. Equipped with two types of sensors, the U- 2 produces real-time infrared images of fireground scenes. Information acquired by the U- 2 's scanners defines the fire boundary and aids fire management decisions by showing the size, shape and direction of burn and the locations of hot spots in the fire zone. U- 2 sends sensor date in digital form to an antenna at Ames Research Center. There the data is computer processed into images which are overlaid on U. S. Geological Survey topographical maps of the fire area. Maps are then transmitted by <b>telecopy</b> machine directly to fire control center. Whole process takes less than 10 minutes and the U- 2 can provide information for up to five hours. Ames antenna can pick up signals from the U- 2 anywhere within a 300 mile radius from Ames...|$|E
40|$|Airborne system rapidly {{delivers}} {{hard copy}} to firefighters. Sensors in airplane send data to ground station for image processing. Imagery immediately transferred to U. S. Geologic Survey (USGS) maps by photo interpreter. Maps transmitted by <b>telecopies</b> directly to fire-control camps. Receipt by fire camp less than 10 minutes. Information aids in decisions involving deployment of firefighters and equipment, flood control, monitoring oilspills, observing thermal currents, and pollutions monitoring...|$|R
50|$|Fax (short for facsimile), {{sometimes}} called <b>telecopying</b> or telefax (the latter short for telefacsimile), is the telephonic transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images), normally to a telephone number {{connected to a}} printer or other output device. The original document is scanned with a fax machine (or a telecopier), which processes the contents (text or images) as a single fixed graphic image, converting it into a bitmap, and then transmitting it through the telephone system {{in the form of}} audio-frequency tones. The receiving fax machine interprets the tones and reconstructs the image, printing a paper copy. Early systems used direct conversions of image darkness to audio tone in a continuous or analog manner. Since the 1980s, most machines modulate the transmitted audio frequencies using a digital representation of the page which is compressed to quickly transmit areas which are all-white or all-black.|$|R
