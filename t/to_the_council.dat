5|$|After Dorgon's {{death on}} the last day of 1650, the Shunzhi Emperor started his {{personal}} rule: he ordered the members of the Council to memorialize to him directly on important matters of state. After Dorgon's supporters had been purged from the court (by March 1651), his former co-regent Jirgalang made a number of special appointments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> to foster loyalty among the Manchu elite. Between 1651 and 1653, he added thirty new members who lacked official positions in the Banners or the metropolitan bureaucracy. Two of the new appointees were Chinese Bannermen Fan Wencheng 范文程 (1597–1666) and Ning Wanwo 寗完我 (d. 1665), two of only three Chinese who were ever appointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council.</b> All four of the future regents for the Kangxi Emperor (Oboi, Suksaha, Ebilun, and Soni) were also appointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> at that time. In 1656, the emperor issued an edict abolishing the automatic appointment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> of Manchu and Mongol Grand Secretaries, yet by the end of his reign in 1661, the Council still counted more than fifty members. During the Shunzhi reign, the Council was often convened to investigate important officials who had been accused of corruption or malfeasance.|$|E

Abaqa's Latin secretary Rychaldus delivered a report <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> which outlined previous European-Ilkhanid relations under Abaqa's father, Hulagu, affirming that after Hulagu had welcomed Christian ambassadors to his court, he had agreed to exempt Latin Christians from taxes and charges, {{in exchange for their}} prayers for the Khan. According to Rychaldus, Hulagu had also prohibited the molestation of Frank establishments, and had committed to return Jerusalem to the Franks. Rychaldus assured the assembly that even after Hulagu's death, his son Abaqa was still determined to drive the Mamluks from Syria.|$|E

5|$|In 1543, several {{conservative}} clergymen in Kent {{banded together}} to attack and denounce two reformers, Richard Turner and John Bland, before the Privy Council. They prepared articles to present <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council,</b> {{but at the last}} moment, additional denunciations were added by Stephen Gardiner's nephew, Germain Gardiner. These new articles attacked Cranmer and listed his misdeeds back to 1541. This document and the actions that followed were the basis of the so-called Prebendaries' Plot. The articles were delivered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> in London and were probably read on 22 April 1543. The king most likely saw the articles against Cranmer that night. The archbishop, however, appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made. His commissioners in Lambeth dealt specifically with Turner's case where he was acquitted, much to the fury of the conservatives.|$|E

In May, Hutchinson even approved Hancock's election <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Council,</b> the upper chamber of the General Court, whose members were elected by the House but subject to veto by the governor.
