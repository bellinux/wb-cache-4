40|$|The {{effect of}} Emblica officinalis fruit extract (EFE) against alcohol-induced hepatic damage in rats was {{investigated}} in the present study. In vitro studies showed that EFE possesses antioxidant as well nitric oxide (NO) scavenging activity. In vivo administration of alcohol (5  g/kg b. wt/day) for 60  days resulted increased liver lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyls, nitrite plus nitrate levels. Alcohol administration also significantly lowers the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase and reduced glutathione as compared with control rats. Administration of EFE (250  mg/kg body weight) to alcoholic rats significantly brought the plasma enzymes towards near normal level and also significantly reduced the levels of lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyls and restored the enzymic and non-enzymatic antioxidants level. This observation was supplemented by histopathological examination in liver. Our data indicate that the <b>tannoid,</b> flavonoid and NO scavenging compounds present in EFE may offer protection against free radical mediated oxidative stress in rat hepatocytes of animals with alcohol-induced liver injury...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} {{and use of}} herbal remedies (turmeric, tulsi, amla and aloe vera etc.) has been reviewed systematically. Turmeric (curcumin), acts as an antioxidant, antimutagenic, antiinflamatory and antimicrobial agent and protect liver against a variety of toxicants. Tulsi (eugenol) have anticancer properties, reduced blood glucose levels, total cholesterol levels and promotes immune system function. Amla, richest source of vitamin-c and it's active <b>tannoid</b> principles have antimicrobial, antidiabetics, anticarcinogenic properties and enhances immune property. Aloe vera contains phytochemicals (Saponins, flavonoids, alkaloids and phenols), which {{is an indication of}} cosmetic and medicinal value. Turmeric, tulsi, amla and aloe vera preparations increased the body weight gain, feed efficiency and decreased the feed intake. These preparations decreased the mortality rates and the cost of feed has been decreased from 6. 2 % to 13. 5 %. They have reduced the fat accumulation, increased dressing percentage, liver weight, spleen weight and whole giblet weights. Significant reduction of serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides and increased the humoral response against RD vaccine...|$|E
30|$|Biochemical and {{hormonal}} estimations {{of various}} parameters {{indicated that the}} values of Emblica officinalis treated groups were near the control values. Emblica officinalis extract {{has been shown to}} have antioxidant and antiperoxidant properties due to the presence of tanoids, mainly emblicanin-A, emblicanin-B, punigluconin, pedunculogin gallic acid (Bhattacharya et al. 1999)and also steroid (Gupta et al. 2013). The in vitro antioxidant activity of <b>tannoids</b> was demonstrated by Ghosal et al. (1996). Some of the plants like Glycyrrhiza Glabra (liqurice), Rubia Cordifolia (Family-Rubiaceae) and Phyllanthus, Emblica have also been reported to possess antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities (Jose and Kuttan 1995; Tripathi et al. 1997; Korina and Afanasav 1997). The emblicanin are probable to the major antioxidant principles and it also reported that the antioxidant action present in vitro (Ghosal et al. 1996) and in vivo (Bhattacharya et al. 1999; Bhattacharya et al. 2000). Emblica officinalis is the rich sources of vitamin C, minerals and amino acids and also contains a wide variety of phenolic compounds (Rajkumar et al. 2011), those are the excellent scavengers of oxygen free radicals within the cells where reactive metabolites are produced (Uzunhisarcikli et al. 2007) by chlorpyrifos toxicity. Steroids are present in water soluble Emblica officinalis extract (Gupta et al. 2013), that may mimic the normal function of testosterone which {{plays an important role in}} reproductive development in mammals. But any of the other constituents of aqueous extract of Emblica officinalis may inhibit the secretion of testosterones when administrated singly amla.|$|R
40|$|Ochratoxins are {{secondary}} toxic fungal metabolites {{produced by}} Aspergillus ochraceus (1). The presence of ochratoxins in staple foods, bever-ages, milk and milk products {{have been reported}} from {{various parts of the}} world (2). Experimental studies have shown that ochratoxins are nephrotox-ic, hepatotoxic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, cytotoxic and immunotoxic in nature (3). Male reproductive health has been deteriorated in many countries dur-ing the last few decades. A number of toxins in envi-ronment have been suspected to affect reproductive system in male, and ochratoxin is one of them. Ochratoxin A is a reproductive toxicant and prolong intake of it may bring abnormalities in the morphology of sperm cells (4). The presence of ochratoxin-DNA adducts in the testis of rats indi-cates spermatotoxic effect of ochratoxin (5). LPO and oxidative stress are also believed {{to play an important role}} in ochratoxin-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity (6). Oxidative stress can cause mutagenecity, cytotoxicity and stimulate changes in gene expression in the development of cancer (7). Emblica officinalis normally known as amla, has been used extensively in ancient Indian Ayurveda. It is a member of small genus Emblica (family Euphorbiacae) which is commonly found in India and South-East Asian countries (8). The fruit contains an array of bioactive components mainly quercetin, phyllambic compound, gallic acid, tan-nins, flavonoids, pectin and vitamin C (9). These are the major group of phenolics exhibiting marked pharmacological activity (10). Several studies have shown that Emblica officinalis possesses antioxida-tive activity. This may be because of the presence of high concentration of flavonoids, <b>tannoids,</b> and vita-min C which show effective results against oxida-tive damage (11). Emblica officinalis extract also have been shown to possess powerful antidiabetic, lipid-lowering, antisclerotic, hepatoprotective and anticancer activities (12). The present study was undertaken to evaluate the possible ameliorative effect of Emblica offici-nalis aqueous extract on ochratoxin-induced lipid peroxidation and its antioxidative defense mecha-nism in the testis of mice...|$|R
40|$|Weekly {{observations}} over a 7 -year period {{show that}} the phytoplankton of Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, is alternately dominated, from May through October, by brief blooms of the diatom Skeletonema costatum and the flagellate OZtihodiscus Zuteus. The two species are almost never abundant simultaneously. When grown together in culture, {{one or the other}} dominates, the outcome of competition depending on the relative ages and concentrations of the inocula. Culture experiments in which each species was grown in medium conditioned by growth of the same or the other species, with nutrients restored, showed that 1) each species somewhat inhibits its own growth, 2) Skeletonema does not inhibit OZisthodiwus, and 3) Skeletonema is inhibited by high concentrations of OZ&&odis~s-conditoned medium, but is stimulated by low concentrations. It is pro-posed that OZtihodticus achieves dominance by production of large amounts of an ectocrine (of suggested <b>tannoid</b> nature) that inhibits Skeletonema and that Skeletonema achieves dominance primarily by virtue of its superior reproductive rate, but that in addition, in small competing populations, its growth is accelerated by the OZisthodiscus ectocrine-a stimulant in low concentrations. These mechanisms are shown to explain satisfactorily events observed in bialgal culture and are believed to be operative in nature...|$|E
