The ST has an incentive to collaborate with the best PT for the sake of minimizing the ST’s transmit power under the constraint of its QoS requirement, whilst simultaneously winning a transmission opportunity for its own traffic. Moreover, based on the matching theory and queueing theory, we analyse the algorithmic stability and the queueing stability of the cooperative spectrum leasing system exploiting our DWWRS-MAS, respectively.

30|$|Most of {{the current}} studies on {{friendly}} jammer are carried out within relay [18 – 21] and cognitive scenarios [22 – 24]. Article [19] studies a two-way relay system with an untrusted relay node. The <b>transmission</b> <b>pair</b> improves its secrecy rate by buying proper jamming power from the friendly jammers. In [20], a coalition formation game is formulated to investigate the cooperation between relays and friendly jammers in order to assist data transmission. The drawback of those schemes is the requirement for installation and maintenance of the dedicated jammers, resulting in a significant cost to the operator. A friendly jamming paradigm using spectrum leasing is developed in [22], where the jammers are unsubscribed nodes that also have data to transmit. The subscribed user attracts the jammers’ cooperation {{by allowing them to}} use a fraction of its frame for their own data transmissions. In [23], a new cooperative scheme is introduced in a cognitive network with several relay nodes. The secondary users (SUs) are allowed to transmit simultaneously with the primary user (PU). In the first hop, the SU transmitter sends its information to the relay while the SU receiver acts as a friendly jammer. In the second hop, the relay passes the information to the SU receiver and the transmitter, in turn, takes the role of disturbing the eavesdropper. Nonetheless, most existing work on friendly jammer is based on a relatively simple network topology, which considers only one <b>transmission</b> <b>pair</b> (i.e., a source and a destination). Studies in [25 – 27] investigate the power allocation of the friendly jammer in a network with multiple source-destination links, but there is only one jammer in the system. All those abovementioned approaches and scenarios are not suitable for UDNs. In UDNs, several macro base station (MBS)-MUE links need to keep their messages secret. Furthermore, the densely distributed SBSs can be employed as friendly jammers to help MUEs with secure communication, which avoids deploying dedicated jammers. Hence, friendly jammer via SBSs is an appropriate method to enhance the security of UDNs.|$|E

40|$|Most human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) transmissions in sub-Saharan Africa are believed to occur between married adults who are discordant for their HIV- 1 infection status; however, no studies to date have investigated the molecular epidemiology of such transmission events. Here we report the genetic characterization of HIV- 1 strains from 149 <b>transmission</b> <b>pairs</b> that were identified prospectively in a cohort of discordant couples in Lusaka, Zambia. Subgenomic gag, gp 120, gp 41, and/or long terminal repeat regions were amplified by PCR analysis of uncultured blood samples from both partners and sequenced without interim cloning. Pairwise genetic distances were calculated for the regions analyzed and compared to those of subtype-specific reference sequences {{as well as local}} controls. Sequence relationships were also examined by phylogenetic tree analysis. By these approaches, epidemiological linkage was established for the majority of <b>transmission</b> <b>pairs.</b> Viruses from 129 of the 149 couples (87 %) were very closely related and clustered together in phylogenetic trees in a statistically highly significant manner. In contrast, viruses from 20 of the 149 couples (13 %) were only distantly related in two independent genomic regions, thus ruling out transmission between the two partners.

To what extent HIV- 1 transmission is a stochastic process or driven by selective forces that allow T/F viruses best to overcome bottlenecks in transmission has not been conclusively resolved. Building on prior investigations that suggest HIV- 1 envelope (Env) features to contribute in the selection process during transmission, we compared phenotypic virus characteristics of nine HIV- 1 subtype B <b>transmission</b> <b>pairs,</b> six {{men who have sex}} with men and three male-to-female <b>transmission</b> <b>pairs.</b> RESULTS All recipients were identified early in acute infection and harbored based on extensive sequencing analysis a single T/F virus allowing a controlled analysis of virus properties in matched <b>transmission</b> <b>pairs.</b> Recipient and transmitter viruses from the closest time point to transmission showed no signs of selection for specific Env modifications such as variable loop length and glycosylation. Recipient viruses were resistant to circulating plasma antibodies of the transmitter and also showed no altered sensitivity to a large panel of entry inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies. The recipient virus did not consistently differ from the transmitter virus in terms of entry kinetics, cell-cell transmission and replicative capacity in primary cells. Our paired analysis revealed a higher sensitivity of several recipient virus isolates to interferon-α (IFNα) which suggests that resistance to IFNα cannot be a general driving force in T/F establishment.

METHODS: A phylogenetic tree was constructed with 19 604 Swiss sequences and 90 994 non-Swiss background sequences. Swiss <b>transmission</b> <b>pairs</b> were identified using 104 combinations of genetic distance (1 %- 2. 5 %) and bootstrap (50 %- 100 %) thresholds, to examine the effect of those criteria. Monophyletic pairs were classified as recent or chronic transmission based on the time interval between estimated seroconversion dates. Logistic regression with adjustment for clinical and demographic characteristics was used to identify risk factors associated with transmission during recent or chronic infection. FINDINGS: Seroconversion dates were estimated for 4079 patients on the phylogeny, and comprised between 71 (distance, 1 %; bootstrap, 100 %) to 378 <b>transmission</b> <b>pairs</b> (distance, 2. 5 %; bootstrap, 50 %). We found that 43. 7 % (range, 41 %- 56 %) of the transmissions occurred {{during the first year of}} infection. Stricter phylogenetic definition of <b>transmission</b> <b>pairs</b> was associated with higher recent-phase transmission fraction. Chronic-phase viral load area under the curve (adjusted odds ratio, 3; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 64 - 5. 48) and time to antiretroviral therapy (ART) start (adjusted odds ratio 1. 4 /y; 1. 11 - 1. 77) were associated with chronic-phase transmission as opposed to recent transmission. Importantly, at least 14 % of the chronic-phase transmission events occurred after the transmitter had interrupted ART. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a high fraction of transmission during recent HIV infection but also chronic transmissions after interruption of ART in Switzerland. Both represent key issues for treatment as prevention and underline the importance of early diagnosis and of early and continuous treatment...|$|R

In order to satisfy the QoS requirements such as required bandwidth and end-to-end delay for different source-destination <b>transmission</b> <b>pairs,</b> it requires a QoS routing protocol to discover routes with QoS guarantees. The proposed QoS routing protocol discovers routes for source-destination <b>transmission</b> <b>pairs</b> with bandwidth and end-to-end delay guarantees.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} previously, existing approaches do {{not apply}} directly to UDNs {{due to the fact}} that both the users and jammers have more than one candidate servers or clients. When there is only one source-destination link, the jammers do not need to consider which pair to choose, nor do the <b>transmission</b> <b>pair</b> in the situation where exists only one jammer. Nevertheless, in UDNs, the MUEs compete for the most effective jammers from multiple SBSs for themselves, while the SBSs carefully estimate the revenue from different MUEs and choose the one that brings the maximum benefits as a client user. This generates a two-way selection problem, making it more difficult to form the cooperative structure between the users and jammers. Therefore, extensions and modifications are needed to model the two-way selection among the multiple MUEs and jammers. Furthermore, jammers in previous studies have no resource to transmit data. They obtain the transmission opportunity as the resource reward for providing jamming service to the <b>transmission</b> <b>pair,</b> as in [22, 23]. More specifically, the jammers in the previous studies do not have any chance to serve their own traffic unless if they provide jamming service. Hence, the jammers in existing articles have strong motivation to perform cooperative jamming, which is not the case in UDNs. The SBSs have their own users and limited resource. Providing friendly jamming means a loss of performance for SBSs since they allocate part of their power to jamming and concentrate less on their own users. Consequently, the SBSs need to weigh the income against the performance loss and may not be so willing to help. A more powerful mechanism of reimbursement is required to encourage the SBSs to cooperate as well as to enhance their performance when they provide the jamming service. In addition, interference has always been a problem in UDNs. Though friendly jammer takes advantage of interference to protect privacy, a careful balance among all kinds of interferences is also required to guarantee the overall performance of the network. Therefore, the introduction of friendly jammer to UDNs is a more intricate problem. To our best knowledge, it is the first work to apply friendly jammer to UDNs.|$|E

In [3], a variety of low complexity cooperative protocols are considered information theoretically under the framework of diversity-multiplexing tradeoffs, with an extension to multiple RSs studied in [4]. In [5], the outage behavior of general cooperative diversity systems is analyzed. However, as pointed out in [6], the design of distributed space-time coding algorithms for exploiting cooperative diversity {{is very different from the}} link level space-time codes. The number of virtual antenna elements (i.e., relay nodes) may differ from time to time, and information is input to the virtual antenna elements through a possibly noisy channel. Besides, the formation of a virtual antenna array requires significant amounts of coordination for both signaling and synchronization.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Cooperative {{communication}} {{techniques have}} been proposed {{in order to improve}} the quality of the received signals at the receivers by using the diversity added by duplication of signals sent by relay terminals situating between each <b>transmission</b> <b>pair.</b> This paper proposes an adaptive cooperation technique for frame transmissions in Ad Hoc networks that is compatible to both of the basic access mode and the optional access mode of IEEE 802. 11 Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol. The transmission mode for each data frame is adaptively switched between a cooperative mode and a non-cooperative mode based on the absence of acknowledge (ACK) frame. Simulations show that transmission performance is improved by decreasing the number of re-transmissions due to frame errors; thus, chances of multi-hop mode transitions that are costly in time and bandwidth are alleviated. The analysis of the proposition performance indicates the interest of the adaptation paradigm. It puts forward that, in addition to the channel quality parameter, the channel availability parameter must be concerned in the adaptation process.

40|$|The HIV- 1 {{epidemic}} in sub-Saharan Africa is driven largely by heterosexual transmission of non-subtype B viruses, of which subtypes C and A are predominant. Previous studies of subtype B and subtype C <b>transmission</b> <b>pairs</b> {{have suggested that}} a single variant from the chronically infected partner can establish infection in their newly infected partner. However, in subtype A infected individuals from a sex worker cohort and subtype B individuals from STD clinics, infection was frequently established by multiple variants. This study examined over 1750 single-genome amplified viral sequences derived from epidemiologically linked subtype C and subtype A <b>transmission</b> <b>pairs</b> very early after infection. In 90 % (18 / 20) of the pairs, HIV- 1 infection is initiated by a single viral variant that {{is derived from the}} quasispecies of the transmitting partner. In addition, the virus initiating infection in individuals who were infected by someone other than their spouse was characterized to determine if genital infections mitigated the severe genetic bottleneck observed in a majority of epidemiologically linked heterosexual HIV- 1 transmission events. In nearly 50 % (3 / 7) of individuals infected by someone other than their spouse, multiple genetic variants from a single individual established infection. A statistically significan...|$|R
