A relatively simple abseil can be set up to get down from the shoulder.|$|E

Oversized loads, such as a survival shack hauled by Dufresne, sometimes require his help <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> edge of town to the freight yard.

25|$|Giovanni Brusca was {{tasked with}} killing Falcone. Riina wanted the murder {{carried out in}} Sicily in a {{demonstration}} of Mafia power; he instructed that the attack should be on Highway A29, which Falcone had to use <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> airport to his home on his weekly visits. 400 kilograms of explosives were placed in a culvert under the highway between Palermo International Airport {{and the city of}} Palermo, near the town of Capaci. Brusca's men carried out test drives, using flashbulbs to simulate detonating the blast on a speeding car, and a concrete structure was specially created and destroyed in an experimental explosion to see if the bomb would be powerful enough. Leoluca Bagarella assisted at the scene during preparations.|$|E

25|$|India won the toss and captain Rahul Dravid {{elected to}} field first, after five overs {{were cut off}} each side's innings due to heavy {{overnight}} rain. West Indies hit 251 runs for 6 wickets, with Chris Gayle contributing nearly half the total, 123, before he was out with five overs remaining to Ajit Agarkar, who got the most wickets for India, claiming two for 38. However, India also had an opener contributing a century, with Rahul Dravid bringing up his hundred in 99 balls, eventually ending with 105 off 102. Dravid paired up with Mohammad Kaif to add 123 for the fourth wicket, before Dwayne Bravo had Dravid caught, leaving India with 43 <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last 37 balls; with two fours and a six from Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and Kaif hitting 16 off his last 16 deliveries, India {{made it to the}} target with a ball to spare.|$|E
25|$|Pune started {{positively}} {{in their}} runchase, despite losing Rahul Tripathi {{early in the}} innings. After being dropped on 14, Ajinkya Rahane made 44 from 38 deliveries, putting up a 54-run partnership with Smith which ended with Rahane's dismissal in the 12th over. Economical bowling from Mumbai bowlers restricted Pune to 83 for 2 after 15 overs, leaving them 47 <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last 5 overs. Pune struck 14 runs in the 16th over to tilt the match in their favour, before Jasprit Bumrah dismissed MS Dhoni in the next over in which he conceded only 3 runs. Pune reached 119 for 3 {{at the end of}} 19 overs with a six from Smith off the penultimate ball of the penultimate over, and the equation read 11 runs to get in the final over to be bowled by Johnson. Manoj Tiwary struck a four off the first ball, before he and Smith were dismissed caught in the deep in the next two deliveries. A drop catch off the penultimate ball allowed Pune to get two runs and come within four runs of the target with one ball to go. On the final ball of the innings, Dan Christian ran two and Washington Sundar was run out attempting a third run, resulting in a one-run victory for Mumbai.|$|E
25|$|The {{track work}} is quite complex there, {{allowing}} trains {{to enter the}} Pitkin Yard from both the express and local tracks (where C trains relay <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> southbound to the northbound local track), and with connections to the two-track Grant Avenue station from both the express and local tracks; the Grant Avenue spur then veers northeast towards Liberty Avenue. All four mainline tracks continue below the Grant Avenue connection, used only to store trains, east under Pitkin Avenue until approximately Eldert Lane (just south of the Grant Avenue station). It was planned that these tracks would continue under Pitkin Avenue to Cross Bay Boulevard, {{as part of a}} never-built system expansion which would have extended the Fulton Street Subway to the Rockaways and to Cambria Heights near the Queens-Nassau County border. On the electric light signal board in the control room at Euclid Avenue, there is a taped-over section of the board that hides the 76th Street station. There are also two tracks coming from the Pitkin Yard heading towards the planned 76th Street station site. These tracks would have merged with the mainline tracks just before 76th Street station. When Pitkin Yard originally opened, the yard leads toward 76th Street were usable to relay short trains on. Today, those two tracks are no longer connected via switches. Parts of the trackways still exist, but the switches were removed and the tunnel ends in a cinderblock wall.|$|E

500|$|Trial on the 1,903counts {{that survived}} pretrial motions began on March 4, 1907. [...] The fact that rebates {{had been given}} was not contested; what was at issue was whether Standard Oil knew the railroad's posted rates, and if it had a duty to enquire if it did not. [...] Landis charged the jury that it [...] "was {{the duty of the}} {{defendant}} diligently in good faith <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Chicago & Alton... the lawful rate".

500|$|A {{flashback}} during [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] {{reveals that}} {{they manage to}} return to New York City, where Michael hands Walt over to Walt's grandmother. Michael then attempts suicide, unable {{to cope with the}} guilt of his murders. Tom (M. C. Gainey), one of the Others, arrives, and tells Michael he can redeem himself by saving the other survivors from an imminent threat. Tom gives Michael a passport with the new name of [...] "Kevin Johnson" [...] in order to infiltrate a freighter that is trying to find the Island. On the freighter he receives a call from Ben, who instructs him to send him information on all the crew, then to sabotage the radio room and the boat engines. In his first season four appearance, Michael meets Sayid (Naveen Andrews) and Desmond (Henry Ian Cusick), who have managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Island to the freighter. They tell the freighter's captain of Michael's true identity, who orders him to repair the engines. During the season finale, Michael and Jin attempt to disarm a bomb planted on the freighter. Michael slows the bomb's detonation with liquid nitrogen, then tells Jin to leave, when he is almost out of nitrogen. When the supply of nitrogen runs out, Christian Shephard (John Terry) appears to Michael and tells him he can go now. The bomb detonates, and Michael is killed in the explosion, having achieved the redemption he had been seeking. Michael reappears halfway through the sixth season as a ghost that only Hurley can see. He explains that the whispers on the island are the voices of those who have died on the island. As Hurley turns to depart, Michael stops him and apologizes for the pain he caused for both him and Libby.|$|E

2500|$|Johnson {{anticipated}} court {{challenges to}} his legislative measures in 1965, {{and thought it}} advantageous to have a [...] "mole" [...] in the Supreme Court who he thought could provide him with inside information, as he was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> legislative branch. Abe Fortas in particular was the individual that Johnson thought could fill the bill. The opportunity arose when an opening occurred for Ambassador to the UN, with Adlai Stevenson's death; Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg accepted Johnson's offer to transfer to the UN position. Johnson [...] insisted on Fortas assuming Goldberg's seat, over Fortas's wife's objection {{that it was too}} early in his career. Mrs. Fortas expressed disapproval to Johnson personally afterwards. When Earl Warren announced his retirement in 1968, Johnson nominated Fortas to succeed him as Chief Justice of the United States, and nominated Homer Thornberry to succeed Fortas as Associate Justice. However, Fortas's nomination was filibustered by senators, and neither nominee was voted upon by the full Senate.|$|E
2500|$|The Loire Valley {{has been}} {{inhabited}} since the Middle Palaeolithic period from 40–90ka. Neanderthal man used stone tools to fashion boats out of tree trunks and navigated the river. Modern man inhabited the Loire valley around 30ka. By around 5000 to 4000BC, they began clearing forests {{along the river}} edges and cultivating the lands and rearing livestock. They built megaliths to worship the dead, especially from around 3500BC. The Gauls arrived in the valley between 1500 and 500BC, and the Carnutes settled in Cenabum {{in what is now}} Orléans and built a bridge over the river. By 600BC the Loire had already become a very important trading route between the Celts and the Greeks.
