5|$|With Sebastian's assistance, Ariel {{finds her}} mother's music box, and they decide <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to Triton. On {{their way back}} to Atlantica, they {{encounter}} Marina, and a struggle ensues in which Ariel is knocked unconscious, witnessed by Triton. Ariel makes a full recovery, and a remorseful Triton allows music back into Atlantica.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Licence to Kill, legal wrangling {{over control of the}} series and the James Bond {{character}} resulted in a six-year delay before production of the next Bond film which resulted in Dalton deciding not <b>to</b> <b>return.</b> <b>It</b> is also the final Bond film for actors Robert Brown (as M) and Caroline Bliss (as Moneypenny), screenwriter Richard Maibaum, title designer Maurice Binder, editor John Grover, cinematographer Alec Mills, director and former Bond film editor John Glen, and producer Albert R. Broccoli, although he would later act as a consulting producer for GoldenEye before his death.|$|E

50|$|The 46 ft vessel, most {{recently}} berthed in Northern Ireland after {{being used as}} a leisure craft, was recently purchased by a local dignitary in Peterhead with a view <b>to</b> <b>returning</b> <b>it</b> as an exhibition piece to the town.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 12th century, {{the castle}} become closely {{associated}} with King John, who had been granted the town by Richard I in 1189. John seized the castle as well during his revolt in 1191, and although he was forced <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>it,</b> he reclaimed it when he became king himself in 1199. John made extensive use of Wallingford Castle during the First Barons' War between 1215 and 1216, reinforcing the fortifications and mobilising a substantial garrison to protect it.|$|E
5|$|In January 2006, Flying Scotsman duly {{entered the}} National Railway Museum's {{workshops}} {{for a major}} overhaul <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to Gresley's original specification and to renew its boiler certificate. It was initially estimated that this would only take one year, and cost around £750,000. The bay in which the locomotive was being refurbished was on view to visitors to the NRM but the engine was rapidly dismantled {{to such an extent}} that the running plate was the only component recognisable to the casual observer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, the Parliamentary {{authorities}} undertook a three-week conservation project to repair and restore the statue. It consisted of removing accumulated dirt and an old coating of black wax, repatinating the bronze surface <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to its original colour and treating it with a clear wax as protection from pollution and the elements. The bas reliefs on the pedestal were also cleaned and treated, as was the pedestal itself.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{three out}} of the serial's twelve episodes have been recovered. 16mm copies of episodes 5 and 10 were {{returned}} in the early 1980s, under unclear circumstances (with rumour claiming they {{were found in the}} basement of a Mormon church). Episode 2 was returned in 2004 by former BBC engineer Francis Watson. He had come across the film in the 1970s, while clearing a projector testing room at the BBC's Ealing Studios. Instead of disposing of the film as instructed, he brought it home – eventually <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to the Corporation when he realised the value of the material.|$|E
5|$|Since the Separatists are {{secretly}} {{building a}} battle droid army, Palpatine uses {{the situation to}} have himself granted emergency powers. Palpatine feigns reluctance to accept this authority, promising <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to the Senate once the crisis has ended. His first act is to allow {{the creation of a}} clone army to counter the Separatist threat; this results in the opening salvo of the Clone Wars. With the galaxy now at war as Sidious planned, Dooku brings him the secret plans for a new superweapon.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} air {{activity}} over German-held territory. RAF Bomber Command flew 92 sorties against German invasion targets at Boulogne, Calais, Ostend, Dunkirk, and Antwerp. The remaining sorties were directed at Brussels marshalling yards, Hamm and Krefeld. One Armstrong Whitworth Whitley failed <b>to</b> <b>return.</b> <b>It</b> {{was lost to}} ground fire over the Netherlands. A total of 157 sorties were flown overall. By the September 1940, some 10–13% of invasion barges had been sunk.|$|E

[...] In a 2011 interview with The Comics Journal, however, he admitted that, while he had entertained the idea of <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> Underwater, perhaps giving it the annotation treatment he had given to Ed the Happy Clown in 2004, his [...] "heart just wasn’t in it" [...] anymore.|$|R
50|$|Auziņš {{played with}} Riga Vanderers until 1939, then retired from active {{football}} only <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> during World War II. In 1941 during the German occupation of Latvia {{he played with}} the Students football club, and from 1942 to 1944 - with US Riga.|$|R

5|$|At Moe's Tavern, Moe informs Homer and {{his friends}} {{that one of them}} must be a {{designated}} driver, and Barney loses the choosing draw. After Barney drives the drunken men home in Homer's car, Homer allows him to use it to drive himself home, expecting Barney <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> the following morning. In his distressed state, Barney disappears with the car. Two months later, Barney returns to Moe's Tavern, unable to recall where he left the car. Homer later receives a letter from the New York City government, which informs him that his car has been found parked in the World Trade Center plaza. Homer reveals to the family that he had once been to New York before when he was 17 years old and had a horrible experience. Marge and the children persuade Homer to go retrieve the car and he reluctantly agrees.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the {{protective}} lacquer covering Knife Edge Two Piece degraded and exposed the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining protective lacquer and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, and take the surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of graffiti the sculpture was repatinated <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a weatherproof surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working in consultation with the Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|E
50|$|Stable limit cycles are {{examples}} of attractors. They imply self-sustained oscillations: the closed trajectory describes perfect periodic behavior of the system, and any small perturbation from this closed trajectory causes the system <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> making the system stick to the limit cycle.|$|R

5|$|Fischer and Cristina {{often did}} outdoor {{activities}} together, but Fischer's stepmother {{thought they were}} only friends. She said that she never saw them hold hands or behave {{in a way that}} suggested intimacy. According to his friends, Fischer went with Cristina to South Padre Island, Texas, during spring break and had sex with her in her parents' condominium. They said that he did not brag about it, and in fact seemed to regret his decision. Cristina denied this ever happened. Later that year they attended St. Joe's prom together. In June 1992, Fischer broke up with Cristina; he told one of his friends that their relationship was only physical, and he did not feel an emotional attachment to her. Fischer had given Cristina his ring while they were dating, and once they broke up he asked her <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>it.</b> Cristina refused.|$|E
5|$|Following the report, the NRM {{commissioned}} First Class Partnerships (FCP) to independently {{review the}} remaining work identified as necessary by the NRM, and make recommendations {{on how to}} proceed. In March 2013, the museum announced FCP had determined the locomotive would {{not return to the}} main line until 2015, and believed the outstanding work should be put out to external tender. On 29 October 2013 the museum announced Riley & Son in Bury as the winning contractor, and the same day the locomotive was moved to their workshop in order <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to running condition no earlier than summer 2015. On 29 April 2015, Flying Scotsmans boiler left the National Railway Museum to be reunited {{with the rest of the}} locomotive at Riley & Son in Bury.|$|E
5|$|In 1191 Leo {{captured}} and rebuilt Bagras, a strategically important fortress that Saladin had seized from the Knights Templar and then destroyed before abandoning it. Bohemond ordered Leo <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to the Templars, but Leo refused, stating that his right of recent conquest was stronger that {{the claim of}} the Templars who had lost their property. After Bohemond failed include Cilicia in his truce with Saladin in 1192, Leo invited him to Bagras to start negotiations. Bohemond accepted the offer, but Leo had him captured, forcing him to surrender Antioch. Although the noblemen (who were closely related to Armenian nobles) were willing to accept Leo's rule, the mainly Greek and Latin townspeople formed a commune and prevented the Armenian soldiers from occupying Antioch.|$|E

50|$|Louisbourg was an {{important}} bargaining chip in the peace negotiations to end the war, since it represented a major British success. Factions within the British government were opposed <b>to</b> <b>returning</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the French as part of any peace agreement, but these were eventually overruled, and Louisbourg was returned, {{over the objections of}} the victorious British North Americans, to French control after the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.|$|R
5|$|Looking to do {{a family}} film, Johnny Depp visited the Walt Disney Studios in 2001 {{when he heard}} of plans to adapt the Pirates of the Caribbean ride into a film. Depp was excited by the {{possibility}} of reviving an old Hollywood genre, and found the script met his quirky sensibilities: the crew of the Black Pearl were not in search of treasure but trying <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to lift a curse on them, and the traditional mutiny had already occurred. Depp was cast on June 10, 2002. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer felt Depp would give the film an edge that could draw teenage and adult audiences despite Disney's reputation for soft children's fare.|$|E
5|$|Stevenson {{was elected}} a bencher of the Inner Temple in 1950, and {{appointed}} Recorder of Cambridge, a part-time judge, in 1952; {{he had previously}} served as Recorder for Rye from 1944 to 1951. In 1954 he represented the government of British Kenya during Jomo Kenyatta's unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel Mau Mau; Kenyatta was a moderate, and is now considered unlikely {{to have been a}} member of the organisation. He was imprisoned until 1959, lived under house arrest until 1961, and became the first president of the newly independent Kenya in 1964. Also in 1954 Stevenson represented the Marten family in the Crichel Down affair. The Air Ministry had compulsorily purchased land for bombing practice before the war, promising <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> after the end of hostilities. When they did not honour this promise, the Martens successfully campaigned to be allowed to buy the land back. The case led to a public enquiry, changes in the law on compulsory purchase, and the first resignation of a government minister since 1917.|$|E
5|$|That the gun had a {{silencer}} on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With the silencer, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned the gun on herself. According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed {{to have been made}} during a fight for the gun. That the silencer was found in the gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason <b>to</b> <b>return</b> <b>it</b> to the cupboard before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E
