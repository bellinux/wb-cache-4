5|$|The second torpedo struck Bismarck in her stern on {{the port}} side, near the port rudder shaft. The {{coupling}} {{on the port}} rudder assembly was badly damaged and the rudder became locked in a 12° <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>port.</b> The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by Lütjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless. At 21:15, Lütjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Navy, {{which had}} {{recently}} received the German code books captured from the beached cruiser , {{was aware that}} an operation was taking place, but uncertain as to where the Germans would strike. Therefore, the Admiralty ordered David Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, the six battleships of the 2nd Battle Squadron, {{and a number of}} cruisers and destroyers to attempt to intercept the German battlecruisers. However, Beatty's task force nearly ran headlong into the entire High Seas Fleet. At 6:20, Beatty's destroyer screen came into contact with the German torpedo boat V155. This began a confused 2-hour battle between the British destroyers and the German cruiser and destroyer screen, frequently at very close range. At {{the time of the first}} encounter, the Kaiser-class battleships were less than 10 miles away from the 6 British dreadnoughts; this was well within firing range, but in the darkness, neither British nor German admiral were aware of the composition of their opponents' fleets. Admiral Ingenohl, loathe to disobey the Kaiser's order to not risk the battlefleet without his express approval, concluded that his forces were engaging the screen of the entire Grand Fleet, and so 10 minutes after the first contact, he ordered a <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> on a south-east course. Continued attacks delayed the turn, but by 6:42, it had been carried out. For about 40minutes, the two fleets were steaming on a parallel course. At 7:20, Ingenohl ordered a further <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>port,</b> which put his ships on a course for German waters.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) and was in a <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>port.</b> The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally the rudder is controlled electrically from the bridge to the motors forward of the Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, forward of the rudder. In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering, but orders from the bridge to the rudder may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The speed of the torpedo was known and set, but {{the speed of the}} target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E
5|$|Shortly before 16:00 the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group {{encountered}} the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron {{under the command}} of Vice Admiral Sir David Beatty.

2500|$|At 20:52, Voyager {{was ordered}} to resume her plane guard station. Voyager {{acknowledged}} the order and began turning a minute later. It was expected that Voyager would turn away from Melbourne, make a large circle, cross the carrier's stern, then advance towards Melbourne on her port side. Voyager did <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> starboard, away from Melbourne, but then unexpectedly <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>port.</b> It was initially assumed by Melbournes bridge crew that Voyager was [...] "fishtailing", conducting a series of zig-zag <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> slow the ship before swinging behind Melbourne, but Voyager did not alter course again.|$|R
2500|$|At 8:55pm, with Voyager still <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>port,</b> Melbournes {{navigator}} {{ordered the}} carrier's engines to half astern speed, with Robertson ordering an increase to full astern {{a few seconds}} later. At the same time, Stevens, returning to Voyagers bridge from the nearby chart table, gave the order [...] "Full ahead both engines. Hard a-starboard.", before instructing the destroyer's Quartermaster to announce that a collision was imminent. Both ships' measures were too late to avoid a collision; Melbourne hit Voyager at 8:56pm.|$|R
5|$|The ship's crew {{consisted}} of ten officers and 122 enlisted men. She carried {{a number of}} smaller boats, including two pinnaces, two cutters, and one dinghy. Arminius was not a particularly successful design; she suffered from severe, fast rolling, especially in heavier seas. She also shipped {{a great deal of}} water over the bow and was unbalanced in steering. The ship <b>turned</b> rapidly <b>to</b> starboard but was sluggish in <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>port.</b> Indeed, the ship was required to have the rudder at 15degrees <b>to</b> <b>port</b> in order <b>to</b> remain on a straight course. It was also impossible to control the ship with only sail power.|$|R
5|$|Shortly before 16:00, the battlecruisers of I Scouting Group {{encountered}} the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron {{under the command}} of Vice Admiral David Beatty.

At 16:19, Kaiserin was forced to temporarily stop the turbine on the center shaft, as the condenser had started leaking. The crew were able to restart the engine before Kaiserin came into action. By this time, the German battlecruisers were steaming south to draw the British ships toward {{the main body of the}} High Seas Fleet. At 17:30, the crew of the leading German battleship, , spotted both the IScouting Group and the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron approaching.

At 17:45, Scheer ordered a two-point <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> to bring his ships closer to the British battlecruisers. Shortly thereafter the order was given to commence firing; the Kaiser-class ships, with the exception of Prinzregent Luitpold, were not yet within range to engage the British battlecruisers. Prinzregent Luitpold managed to fire eight salvos at 22,300–21,300yards (20,400–19,500m) before the range again widened sufficiently to prevent further firing. In the meantime, Kaiser and Friedrich der Grosse, along with the battleships of II Battle Squadron, were within range of the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron. However, the massed fire from the ten battleships interfered with accurate spotting, and after only a few salvos fire was largely ceased.|$|E
25|$|At around 23.40 large {{ships were}} again sighted and Allen {{attempted}} to challenge. Before {{he could do}} so, the German battleship SMS Westfalen sent her own recognition signal and then turned on searchlights. Broke attempted to fire torpedoes, but the range was very short, {{in the region of}} 150 yards, and the German ship opened fire first. The effect was devastating so that within a couple of minutes 50 crew were killed and another 30 injured, disabling the guns and preventing any effective activity on deck. The helmsman was killed at the wheel, and as he died his body turned the wheel causing the ship to <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> and ram Sparrowhawk. Both ships had already turned to port from line ahead to line abreast to fire torpedoes.|$|E
50|$|On 12 July, Apogon and her wolf pack consorts {{spotted a}} nine-ship Japanese convoy sailing with {{approximately}} six escorts. The submarines immediately began preparing an attack. The leading Japanese ship {{of the center}} column of the formation apparently sighted the wake of Apogons periscope and <b>turned</b> back <b>to</b> ram the submarine. As Apogon was <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> <b>to</b> bring her stern tubes to bear, she was struck on the starboard side by the freighter. About eight feet of the main periscope and periscope shears were torn off, and the radar masts were bent and put out of commission. As a result, Apogon prematurely ended her patrol to return for repairs. She arrived at Midway on 22 July, where crews installed additional bracing on the periscope shears before the submarine proceeded on to Pearl Harbor.|$|R
50|$|On 4 April 1956, Akka left Oxelosund with a {{cargo of}} iron ore bound for Glasgow. The ship entered the Clyde on 9 April 1956 and that evening ran onto the rocks.

Minutes after running aground Akka <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> side and collapsed, hitting a number of {{lifeboats}} which were attempting {{to move away from}} the ship. Three crewmen were killed on site, with a further three dying in hospital.|$|R
50|$|Day {{dispatched}} a launch containing a boarding party of {{an officer and}} five men to investigate the apparent merchant vessel. Laffert realised {{that he was about}} to be discovered, detained the party, and after about an hour fired two torpedoes at Dundee. Dundee manoeuvred out of the way just in time and the torpedoes missed by 20 yd. Day ordered his gun crews to open fire and shells hit Leopard from the stern at such close range that every shot was a hit, smoke and steam rising from Leopard. Leopard <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> starboard but Dundee <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> <b>to</b> avoid a broadside. By this time Leopard had been hit forty times.|$|R
25|$|At around 17:45, Sydney fired two torpedoes {{from her}} {{starboard}} tubes (although some Germans reported more). Prior to the torpedo launch, Detmers {{had decided to}} destroy Sydney completely and ordered the raider to <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> so four-gun salvoes could be fired: this manoeuvre caused the torpedoes to pass astern of Kormoran. After completing the turn, battle damage caused Kormorans engines to fail completely, leaving the raider {{dead in the water}} while Sydney continued to sail southwards at low speed. Kormoran maintained a high rate of fire despite being immobilised—some sailors claimed that up to 450 shells were used during {{the second phase of the}} battle—and scored hits on the cruiser, although many shells missed as the range increased. The raider fired her guns for the last time around 17:50, with the range at , and a torpedo was launched at 18:00, but missed Sydney.|$|E
25|$|By 1418 hours {{both of the}} German flotillas were {{involved}} in the fight. The 4th Torpedo Boat Flotilla attempted to attack with torpedoes a number of times but was frustrated by the heavy seas. Z32 and Z37 turned towards the cruisers, and closing to 12,800 metres, launched six and four torpedoes respectively as the cruisers continued to give heavy and accurate fire. The torpedo attack forced Glasgow to make an emergency <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> as the track of one torpedo passed no more than thirty metres from her port quarter and two more near the port side. Enterprise had by this time separated from Glasgow and both acted independently. After the torpedo attack, the destroyers laid smoke and then retired back towards the flotilla line. The formation was as follows: Z32, Z24, Z37, T23, T27, T26, T22, T25, Z27 and Z25 while Z32 and Z37 being off to port {{in the course of their}} torpedo attack.|$|E
500|$|The British ships {{approached}} the Germans head on, which permitted {{them to use}} only their forward guns, while Bismarck and Prinz Eugen could fire full broadsides. Several minutes after opening fire, Holland ordered a 20° <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>port,</b> which would allow his ships to engage with their rear gun turrets. Both German ships concentrated their fire on Hood. About a minute after opening fire, Prinz Eugen scored a hit with a high-explosive [...] shell, detonating Unrotated Projectile ammunition and starting a large fire on Hood, which was quickly extinguished. Holland then ordered a second 20° <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>port,</b> to bring his ships on a parallel course with Bismarck and Prinz Eugen. By this time, Bismarck had found the range to Hood, so Lütjens ordered Prinz Eugen to shift fire and target Prince of Wales to keep both of his opponents under fire. Within a few minutes, Prinz Eugen scored a pair of hits on the battleship and reported that a small fire had been started.|$|E
50|$|The {{claim was}} also disputed by Hichens's great granddaughter on Channel 4 News. Sally Nilsson {{explained}} that Hichens was a well trained Quartermaster {{with years of}} experience steering large vessels. He had been responsible on his watch for steering the Titanic for four days before the collision and would not have made such a glaring error. As to the steering orders, in 1912 they were as follows: There was only one way of giving steering orders. The order was always given with reference to the tiller. <b>To</b> go <b>to</b> <b>port</b> the Officer ordered starboard. The Quartermaster <b>turned</b> the wheel <b>to</b> <b>port,</b> tiller went <b>to</b> starboard and the ship <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>port.</b> This was a hangover from the old days when ships were steered with tillers, steering oars etc. The change in steering orders did not occur until the 1930s. Sally Nilsson's biography on the life of Robert Hichens was published in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|The stand-on vessel shall {{maintain}} her course and speed, but she may {{take action to}} avoid collision if {{it becomes clear that}} the give-way vessel is not taking appropriate action, or when so close that collision can no longer be avoided by the actions of the give-way vessel alone. In a crossing situation, the stand-on vessel should avoid <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> even if the give-way vessel is not taking appropriate action. These options for the stand-on vessel do not relieve the give-way vessel of her obligations under the rules.|$|R
50|$|A Zero dived on Pirie, {{strafing}} the foredeck and {{the crew}} of the 12-pounder while the corvette's starboard Oerlikon shot back. The bomber dropped two bombs: Pirie <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>port</b> <b>to</b> avoid one, but moved directly under the other. The bomb penetrated the armoured bridge canopy, deflected off the helmsman's station, killed the gunnery officer, then struck the foredeck plating and detonating, where it killed six of the seven men on the main gun. Had it not struck the bridge first, the bomb would likely had penetrated the magazine before detonating and destroying the entire ship.|$|R

About a minute after opening fire, Prinz Eugen scored a hit with a high-explosive [...] shell; the explosion detonated unrotated projectile ammunition and started a large fire, which was quickly extinguished. After firing three four-gun salvoes, Schneider had found the range to Hood; he immediately ordered rapid-fire salvoes from Bismarcks eight 38cm guns. He also ordered the ship's 15cm secondary guns to engage Prince of Wales. Holland then ordered a second 20° <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>port,</b> to bring his ships on a parallel course with Bismarck and Prinz Eugen. Lütjens ordered Prinz Eugen to shift fire and target Prince of Wales, to keep both of his opponents under fire. Within a few minutes, Prinz Eugen scored a pair of hits on the battleship that started a small fire.|$|E
500|$|Construction was {{suspended}} after Hermes {{was launched in}} September 1919 as the Admiralty awaited the results of flight trials with Eagle and [...] Her design was modified in March 1920 with an island superstructure and funnel to starboard, and the forward catapult was removed.
