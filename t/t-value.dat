40|$|The {{performance}} of boreal winter forecasts {{made with the}} European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) System 11 Seasonal Forecasting System is investigated through analyses of ensemble hindcasts for the period 1987 - 2001. The predictability, or signal-to-noise ratio, associated with the forecasts, and the forecast skill are examined. On average, forecasts of 500 hPa geopotential height (GPH) have skill {{in most of the}} Tropics and in a few regions of the extratropics. There is broad, but not perfect, agreement between regions of high predictability and regions of high skill. However, model errors are also identified, in particular regions where the forecast ensemble spread appears too small. For individual winters the information provided by <b>t-values,</b> a simple measure of the forecast signal-to-noise ratio, is investigated. For 2 m surface air temperature (T 2 m), highest <b>t-values</b> are found in the Tropics but there is considerable interannual variability, and in the tropical Atlantic and Indian basins this variability is not directly tied to the El Nino Southern Oscillation. For GPH there is also large interannual variability in <b>t-values,</b> but these variations cannot easily be predicted from the strength of the tropical sea-surface-temperature anomalies. It is argued that the <b>t-values</b> for 500 hPa GPH can give valuable insight into the oceanic forcing of the atmosphere that generates predictable signals in the model. Consequently, <b>t-values</b> may be a useful tool for understanding, at a mechanistic level, forecast successes and failures. Lastly, the extent to which <b>t-values</b> are useful as a predictor of forecast skill is investigated. For T 2 m, <b>t-values</b> provide a useful predictor of forecast skill in both the Tropics and extratropics. Except in the equatorial east Pacific, most of the information in <b>t-values</b> is associated with interannual variability of the ensemble-mean forecast rather than interannual variability of the ensemble spread. For GPH, however, <b>t-values</b> provide a useful predictor of forecast skill only in the tropical Pacific region...|$|R

40|$|Linear {{regression}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} prevalent techniques in machine learning, however, it is also common to use linear regression for its explanatory capabilities rather than label prediction. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is often used in statistics to establish a correlation between an attribute (e. g. gender) and a label (e. g. income) in the presence of other (potentially correlated) features. OLS assumes a particular model that randomly generates the data, and derives <b>t-values</b> [...] - representing the likelihood of each real value to be the true correlation. Using <b>t-values,</b> OLS can release a confidence interval, which is an interval on the reals that is likely to contain the true correlation, and when this interval does not intersect the origin, we can reject the null hypothesis as it is likely that the true correlation is non-zero. Our work aims at achieving similar guarantees on data under differentially private estimators. First, we show that for well-spread data, the Gaussian Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform (JLT) gives a very good approximation of <b>t-values,</b> secondly, when JLT approximates Ridge regression (linear regression with l_ 2 -regularization) we derive, under certain conditions, confidence intervals using the projected data, lastly, we derive, under different conditions, confidence intervals for the "Analyze Gauss" algorithm (Dwork et al, STOC 2014) ...|$|R
