5|$|Time Gal is a FMV-based game {{which uses}} {{pre-recorded}} animation rather than sprites {{to display the}} on-screen action. Gameplay is divided into levels, referred to as time periods. The game begins in 4001 AD with the theft of a time <b>travel</b> <b>device.</b> The thief, Luda, steals the device {{to take over the}} world by changing history. Reika, the protagonist also known as Time Gal, uses her own time <b>travel</b> <b>device</b> to pursue him; she travels to different time periods, such as 70,000,000 BC, 44 BC, 1588 AD, and 2010 AD, in search of Luda. Each time period is a scenario which presents a series of threats that must be avoided or confronted. Successfully navigating the sequences allows the player to progress to another period.|$|E
5|$|This {{episode is}} the forty-ninth from the fifth season of Adventure Time. Visually, the episode is framed having the {{important}} {{events of the}} story occur in its center, bordered circularly. Small polygonal creatures appear {{in the margins of}} the outer frame. Film and television critic Eric Kohn, in IndieWire, dubbed the inner frame a time bubble, absorbing the creatures Bubblegum experiments on with the time <b>travel</b> <b>device.</b> Following Lumpy having her memory erased in the episode, Johnnie appears in the outer frame.|$|E
25|$|The DeLorean {{time machine}} is a fictional automobile-based time <b>travel</b> <b>device</b> {{featured}} in the Back to the Future franchise. In the feature film series, Dr. Emmett Brown builds a time machine based on a DeLorean DMC-12 car, to gain insights into history and the future. Instead, he ends up using it to travel over 130 years of Hill Valley history (from 1885 to 2015) with Marty McFly to change the past for the better and to undo {{the negative effects of}} time travel. One of the cars used in filming is on display at Universal Studios Hollywood.|$|E

40|$|Electronic <b>travel</b> <b>devices</b> {{are used}} to {{transform}} information about the environment that would normally be perceived through the visual sense into a form that can be perceived {{by people who are}} blind or have low vision through another sense (Blasch, Long, & Griffin-Shirley, 1989). They are divided into two broad categories: primary devices and secondary devices. A primary device is one that a person who is blind may use safely and efficiently by itself, independent of a cane or a dog guide. A secondary device is one that must be used in conjunction with a cane or a dog guide to ensure safe and efficient travel (Farmer, 1980). Electronic <b>travel</b> <b>devices</b> are further classified according to function and design. Type 1 devices (such as the Mowat, Polaron, and Sensory 6) are single-output devices for previewing the characteristics of an object ("object preview") and are commonly referred to as "go-no-go " systems. Type 2 devices (including the Laser Cane and Wheelchair Pathfinder) have multiple outputs for previewing objects and involve the use of lasers to provide a "go-no-go " source o...|$|R

Dr. Weird seems to be able to send visions of himself to other places, and can make contact with any spiritual beings. In issue #12 of the Image Comics series, Dr. Weird used his scientific knowledge of time <b>travel</b> <b>devices</b> to aid the Savage Dragon.|$|R
50|$|His current {{right arm}} is a prosthetic, stolen from Forge. A nuclear-powered battle-ready arm, {{incorporates}} in its design a time-travel device, {{the ability to}} channel his energy blasts through, and enhanced strength and resilience. It has since been destroyed after Bishop tried {{to use it to}} time travel from 6700 A.D. to 2010 to kill Cable and Hope Summers due to Cable tampering with the time <b>travelling</b> <b>device</b> within it. His real arm has apparently been re-grown after he was healed in the future by the remnants of humanity.|$|R

50|$|Spock determines from {{questioning}} Mordreaux that he {{was imprisoned}} for developing and using a time <b>travel</b> <b>device.</b> Spock concludes that the older Mordreaux who murdered Kirk was from a different timeline in which Mordreaux became insane and returned to take revenge on those he blamed for his persecution. Since Kirk's death was committed through time travel, Spock constructs a time <b>travel</b> <b>device</b> {{to go back and}} try to save Kirk, without success; this results in Scotty's earlier observations. Spock then tries to go even farther back in time to repair the damage to spacetime caused by Mordreaux's earlier time travel; the naked singularity {{was one of the first}} physical manifestations of this damage. However, Spock's efforts are complicated by the proliferation of timelines and the difficulty in modifying them. During one of these trips, Spock encounters the younger Braithewaite on Aleph Prime, explaining why the lawyer found him familiar.|$|E
50|$|Simultaneously, Joseph Adams (another Yance-man) {{is put on}} {{a special}} mission by Brose.

Jeff meets a council of the Others in this book.|$|E
50|$|Forge suffers {{an array}} of injuries, {{including}} serious head trauma, from Bishop attack during his mad quest to murder the first mutant child following M-Day. Bishop steals several time <b>travel</b> <b>devices</b> that Forge is reverse engineering. Throughout his recovery, Forge is obsessed with recreating his notes and research on these devices. Fixated to an unhealthy degree on this project, Forge shuts himself off in his home at Eagle Plaza to devote all his time to this work. But before he begins, he enhances his home’s defense systems to ensure that he never falls victim to such an attack again.|$|R
40|$|Current {{transformers}} (CTs) are precision {{devices that}} scale high currents down to values {{that can be}} easily handled by measurement equipment. To support CT applications in revenue metering, a comparison on AC current transformer calibration systems was performed among 15 European national metrology institutes using a precision CT as the <b>travelling</b> <b>device.</b> The first comparison results for the transformation ratios (4, 5, 6, 8, 10) kA/ 5 A of the travelling CT at nominal burden of 5 VA and 15 VA indicate good agreement between the participating laboratories. The main differences are found for phase displacement, at least partly caused by the instability of the traveling standard...|$|R
50|$|A thermoacoustic device {{basically}} {{consists of}} heat exchangers, a resonator, and a stack (on standing wave devices) or regenerator (on <b>travelling</b> wave <b>devices).</b> Depending {{on the type}} of engine a driver or loudspeaker might be used as well to generate sound waves.|$|R

Their plan: to corrupt and control the present {{in order to win}} the future. What they didn't plan on was me.|$|E
40|$|The warp is {{a device}} that reframes notions of time and space. It is a common {{cultural}} artefact, one that audiences have come to recognise and believe in through various media. We accept the bed in Bedknobs and Broomsticks, the Tardis in Doctor Who, the supralight speed engines of science fiction, as time/space <b>travel</b> <b>devices</b> {{in order to get}} characters from A to B, to advance their progress along the story path. The warp as a path device can also be seen in board games such as Snakes and Ladders, where both the snake and ladder sections break the linearity of moving the character piece from square to square regularly up and down the game-board. It is therefore natural that such a time/space device has continued and been reconstructed within videogames...|$|R
5000|$|The plot {{follows a}} secret {{branch of the}} United States' National Security Agency which has {{developed}} a time <b>travelling</b> <b>device</b> based upon alien technology found at Roswell. As {{the opening of the}} show says, the Chronosphere, or Backstep Sphere, sends [...] "one human being back in time seven days" [...] to avert disasters. The show's name refers {{to the fact that the}} Backstep Project can only backstep seven days because of limitations imposed by the fuel source and its reactor. As the fuel source is limited, there is a strict mandate that they only Backstep for events relating to [...] "National Security". The backstep team and the equipment are stationed in a base called Never Never Land, which is in a secret location somewhere in the desert of Nevada.|$|R
