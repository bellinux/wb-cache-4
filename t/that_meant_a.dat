To trigger a recall election, proponents of the recall must gather a certain number of signatures from registered voters within a certain time period. The number of signatures statewide must equal 12% of the number of votes cast in the previous election for that office. For the 2003 recall election, <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> minimum of 897,156 signatures, based on the November 2002 statewide elections, but 1.2 million were needed to ensure that there were enough valid signatures.|$|E
500|$|When portraying Trevor, Ogg cites Tom Hardy's {{depiction}} of English criminal Charles Bronson in the 2008 biopic Bronson {{as a strong}} stylistic influence on his portrayal of Trevor. Ogg reflected that while Trevor embodies the violent, psychopathic Grand Theft Auto anti-hero archetype, he wanted players to sympathise with Trevor's story. [...] "To elicit other emotions was tough, {{and it was the}} biggest challenge and it's something <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> lot to me," [...] Ogg said.|$|E
500|$|Since {{so little}} {{information}} was available about lesbians and lesbianism at the time, Bannon's books, through their far-reaching distribution and popularity served {{to form a}} part of a lesbian identity not only for the heterosexual population at large, but lesbians themselves. Lesbian author and historian Joan Nestle called the books [...] "survival literature", explaining: [...] "In whatever towns or cities these books were read, they were spreading the information <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> new hope for trapped and isolated women". One retrospective writer noted, [...] "ntil the late 1960s, when the sexual revolution was emerging, the pulps provided a cultural space that helped to forge a queer identity".|$|E

50|$|Upon Mongolia's {{declaration}} of independence, many Chinese became victims of atrocities, particularly in Khovd. However, after 1912, Chinese businesses {{were able to}} continue their operations, including collection of debts, largely unimpeded. It was only the establishment of communism <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> end to Chinese trade in Mongolia. Ever-increasing obstacles to commerce were created, and {{the closure of the}} border to China for imports in 1928 <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> end for Chinese enterprise in the country.|$|R
500|$|After the 2007 playoffs saw two wild-card {{teams with}} better records (Jacksonville Jaguars and {{eventual}} Super Bowl XLII champions New York Giants) {{go on the}} road to defeat division winners (Pittsburgh Steelers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, respectively) during wild-card weekend, the NFL explored another proposal to change the playoffs so that the team with the better record would host the game, even if <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> division winner went on the road. The NFL's Competition Committee withdrew the request later that offseason, with Atlanta Falcons president Rich McKay mentioning that they wanted the idea to simply get a discussion going. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was a strong opponent of the rule change, believing that [...] "if you win a division, it's good for your fans to know you will have a home game." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics thematically {{relate to}} {{a fear of}} aging and leaving behind the [...] "boldness of youth," [...] {{according}} to Sullivan. Holden considered it a story of an everyman pondering the uncertainty of life whilst navigating his high school yearbook. Rolling Stone John Mcalley too found it an everyman battling {{the fact that his}} [...] "days have become defined by their limitations and dogged ordinariness." [...] For The Rhythm of the Saints, Simon was inspired by poet Derek Walcott, and would base first-draft lyrics on his poems. Simon attempted to match the rhythmic quality of the composition with his lyrics, whether <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> lyric was meaningless or not. A lyric relating to [...] "the cross is in the ballpark," [...] for example, has no meaning; Simon said, [...] "I found [...] to be a satisfying rhythmic phrase against the drums." ...|$|E
500|$|Ogg felt Trevor's {{characterisation}} {{developed over}} time. He said, [...] "Nuances and character traits {{that began to}} appearhis walk, his manner of speech, his reactions, definitely informed his development throughout the game". Ogg cites Tom Hardy's portrayal of English criminal Charles Bronson in the 2008 biopic Bronson as a strong stylistic influence. He opined that while Trevor embodies the violent, psychopathic Grand Theft Auto anti-hero archetype, he wanted to evoke player sympathy to Trevor's story. [...] "To elicit other emotions was tough, {{and it was the}} biggest challenge and it's something <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> lot to me", Ogg explained. Fonteno felt that growing up in South Los Angeles and being exposed to drug trafficking and gang culture authenticated his portrayal of Franklin. [...] "I lived his life before...He's been surrounded by drugs, the crime, living with his auntI lived with my grandmotherso {{there was a lot of}} familiarity", Fonteno said. Having not worked as an actor since portraying Face in the 2001 film The Wash, he sought counsel from Luke and Ogg to refine his acting skills.|$|E
30|$|The {{outer shell}} was {{referred}} to as the ‘background region’ on the reporting form, and there was some confusion as to what part of the phantom <b>that</b> <b>meant.</b> <b>As</b> a result, H 6 reported the background region as a VOI located in a non-active region of the phantom rather than the outer shell.

500|$|Also in 2000, she {{appeared}} in Waking the Dead, a film based on the 1986 novel of the same name, playing Sarah Williams, an activist killed by a car bomb in Minneapolis while she was driving Chilean refugees (Strangely, Sarah Williams was also the name of Connelly's character in Labyrinth). Initially, director Keith Gordon was reluctant to cast Connelly in this role as he did not consider her a serious actress. Her agent Risa Shapiro persuaded him to watch Connelly's performance in Far Harbor. Gordon later said: [...] "There was a subtlety and depth even to her gaze that captured more of the relationship than I ever could have hoped for." [...] About her role, Connelly said, [...] "Waking the Dead was the first film I worked on where whatever I did felt like my own thing. I was really trying {{to make something of}} the part and threw myself into it, so <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> lot to me". The New York Times described her performance, [...] "As Sarah, Ms. Connelly captures a burning ethereality and willfulness that are very much of the period. And she and Mr. Crudup connect powerfully in love scenes that convey the fierce tenderness of a relationship whose passion carries a tinge of religious fervor." ...|$|E
2500|$|More so, Forbes Scott Mendelson {{said that}} the film didn't need to be [...] "whitewashed" [...] and stated that [...] "Even if we accept the {{argument}} that Moses had to be played by a world-renowned movie star and that in all likelihood <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> white actor, I do not accept {{the idea that the}} rest of the main cast needed to be filled out with Caucasian actors of varying recognizability." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1950–1956 – A player needed 2.6 at-bats per team game {{originally}} scheduled. (With the 154-game {{schedule of}} the time, <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> rounded-off 400 at-bats.) From 1951–1954, if the {{player with the}} highest average in a league {{failed to meet the}} minimum at-bat requirement, the remaining at-bats until qualification (e.g., 5, if the player finished the season with 395 ABs) were hypothetically considered hitless at-bats; if his recalculated batting average still topped the league, he was awarded the title. This standard applied in the AL from 1936–1956.|$|E

However, his INC party had reached an electoral agreement with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>an</b> AIADMK candidate would be fielded and he was not allowed to contest the seat. Ponnuranga then decided to stand as a candidate of the small Puthiya Needhi Katchi party, which was allied with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. He came a close second.|$|R

[...] Seeing their potential, he hired them [...] "to give 'em a chance", though <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> seven-member band.

[...] He began to think of the possibilities of a Sydney–Canberra–Melbourne journey of firstly six hours, then progressively shorter. [...] Eventually he fixed on the notion of completing the journey in three hours, which would be highly competitive with air travel. [...] <b>That</b> <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> speed of 350 kilometres an hour – although the world's fastest train at that time, the French TGV, only travelled at 270km/h. (Later he was to set his sights on a symbolic speed, just as 60 miles per hour had been the target in his youth: 360 kilometres an hour, because it represented 100 metres per second.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Yamaguchi wrote new {{lyrics to}} the song, {{and felt like}} the song mixed his past self with his present self. He {{inserted}} many lyrical gimmicks into the song's lyrics, such as hiding the album's title Kikuuiki in the lyric [...] This gimmick was the reason that Yamaguchi decided to capitalize the two central letters of the album title (kikUUiki). Yamaguchi felt that the lyrics he wrote were like a first-person novel, using lyrical techniques {{that he had not}} personally experimented with before. He wrote the lyrics abstractly, using words <b>that</b> <b>meant</b> <b>a</b> lot to Yamaguchi personally that would not mean anything to outside listeners. He hoped that this technique would move listeners, however without fully understanding why they felt moved.|$|E
