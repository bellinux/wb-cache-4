5|$|According to {{a legend}} King Indradyumma was {{directed}} by Lord Jagannath in a dream to build a temple for him which he did as directed. However, according to historical records the temple was started some time during the 12th century by King Chodaganga of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. It was completed by his descendant, Anangabhima Deva, in the 12th century. The wooden images of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were then deified here. The temple was under <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hindu rulers up to 1558. Then, when Orissa was occupied by the Afghan Nawab of Bengal, it was brought under <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Afghan General Kalapahad. Following {{the defeat of the}} Afghan king by Raja Mansingh, the General of Mughal emperor Akbar, the temple became part of the Mughal empire till 1751. Subsequently, it was under <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marathas till 1803. During the British Raj, the Puri Raja was entrusted with its management until 1947.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} between {{the death of}} Cnut the Great in 1035 {{and the death of}} Edward the Confessor in early 1066, the {{independent}} Kingdom of Cornwall was annexed by the neighbouring Kingdom of Wessex, a part of the Kingdom of England. In late 1066 Cornwall, {{along with the rest of}} the lands under <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English king, was conquered by the Normans and came under the control of William the Conqueror. By the late 12thcentury the metal mines were brought under <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crown; operation of the tin mines was devolved to the Lord Warden of the Stannaries, and mining of other metals was directly controlled by the Crown as Mines Royal.|$|E

5|$|Vietnamese {{settlers}} {{began to}} settle in modern-day Cochinchina and Ho Chi Minh City from the 1620s onwards. To the Cambodians, these lands were known as Kampuchea Krom and traditionally under <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Khmer Empire. From the era of Chey Chettha II onwards, they came under <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nguyễn lords. In 1813, Emperor Gia Long sent 10,000 Vietnamese troops into Phnom Penh and {{some members of the}} Cambodian royal family came under <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vietnamese court. The Nguyen court imposed Vietnamese customs upon the Cambodian populace, and names of towns and provinces were changed to Vietnamese ones. Vietnamese settlers were encouraged {{to settle in}} Cambodia and official documents from the Vietnamese court recorded an average of 5,000 Vietnamese settlers coming into Cambodia in the 1830s. The policies imposed by the Nguyen court stirred resentment among the Cambodian populace and provoked occasional rebellions.|$|E

5|$|A 1905 {{review of}} the Falmouth defences {{concluded}} that the naval artillery at St Mawes had become superfluous, as the necessary guns could be mounted at combination of Pendennis and the recently re-established battery at St Anthony's instead. Disarmed, St Mawes was then used as a barracks in the First World War. In 1920 the castle was transferred to <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government's Office of Works, and was opened to visitors, being promoted as a tourist destination by the Great Western Railway company who hoped to profit by increased numbers of visitors to Falmouth.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{conflicts}} occurred between the Empire and its neighbors. Brazil experienced no serious conflicts {{with its neighbors}} {{to the north and}} west, due to the buffer of the nearly impenetrable and sparsely populated Amazonian rainforest. In the south, however, the colonial disputes inherited from Portugal and Spain over <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> navigable rivers and plains which formed the frontiers continued after independence. The lack of mutually agreed borders in this area led to several international conflicts, from the Cisplatine War to the Paraguayan War.|$|E

In 1548, the manor was sold to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, but reverted to <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bishops after his execution.
