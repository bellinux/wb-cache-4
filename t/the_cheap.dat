5|$|Support for the dam project {{came from}} a variety of sources, but {{supporters}} tended to use three primary arguments in favor of its construction: the electricity generated by the project would be cheap and plentiful, industries would be attracted to Alaska by <b>the</b> <b>cheap</b> electricity, and the dam's construction would have minimal impact on the environment and human populations.|$|E
50|$|To {{determine}} <b>the</b> <b>cheapest</b> bond in {{a basket}} of deliverable bonds against a futures contract, implied repo rate is computed for each bond; the bond with the highest repo rate is <b>the</b> <b>cheapest.</b> It is <b>the</b> <b>cheapest</b> because it has the lowest initial value to yield a higher return provided it is delivered with the stated futures price.|$|R

5|$|Supporters of {{the project}} {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> <b>cheap</b> electricity provided by the dam would be a strong enticement for electricity-intensive industries, such as aluminum smelting, to move to Alaska. They were encouraged by a 1962 economic feasibility study by the Development and Resources Corporation, which stated that the electricity generated would attract aluminum, magnesium and titanium industries to the region and help process locally produced minerals. The report also stated that the dam would attract a wood pulp mill on at least a temporary basis to process {{the hundreds of millions}} of board feet of timber that would otherwise be lost as the dam's reservoir flooded. The authors of the DRC report were specific enough to predict that 19,746 jobs would be created by the dam's construction—not including jobs opened during the construction process. Both the 1962 study, and another report by University of Michigan researcher Michael Brewer in 1966, stated that tens of thousands of jobs would be created by the construction process alone, even if <b>the</b> <b>cheap</b> electricity generated by the dam failed to attract any additional industries to Alaska.|$|E

5|$|Ohio River ports {{had been}} stifled by an embargo on the Confederate South and never fully {{recovered}} their economic prominence, leading the south into an economic decline. By contrast, northern Indiana experienced an economic boom when natural gas {{was discovered in}} the 1880s, which directly contributed to {{the rapid growth of}} cities such as Gas City, Hartford City, and Muncie where a glass industry developed to utilize <b>the</b> <b>cheap</b> fuel. The Indiana gas field was then the largest known in the world. The boom lasted until the early 20th century, when the gas supplies ran low. This began northern Indiana's industrialization.|$|E

A news report showcased the omnipresent piracy in the Telugu film {{industry}} by quoting <b>the</b> <b>cheap</b> prices at which the film was being sold. The film's lead actor, Siddharth even went on to request the audiences to buy the original audio CD. The film's producer, Dil Raju, ensured a special code on each distributed print to track piracy with a warning for copyright violation which would incur a fine or a jail term.|$|E
5|$|The film's musical score, {{written by}} cellist Fred Katz, was {{originally}} written for A Bucket of Blood. According to Mark Thomas McGee, author of Roger Corman: The Best of <b>the</b> <b>Cheap</b> Acts, each time Katz was {{called upon to}} write music for Corman, Katz sold the same score {{as if it were}} new music. The score was used in a total of seven films, including The Wasp Woman and Creature from the Haunted Sea. Katz explained that his music for the film was created by a music editor piecing together selections from other soundtracks that he had produced for Corman.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) {{was formed}} as a joint venture by British Petroleum and Gulf. Both British Petroleum and Gulf held equal shares in the venture. KOC pioneered the {{exploration}} for oil in Kuwait during the late 1930s. Oil was discovered at Burgan in 1938 {{but it was not}} until 1946 that the first crude oil was shipped. Oil production started from Rawdhatain in 1955 and Minagish in 1959. KOC started gas production in 1964. It was <b>the</b> <b>cheap</b> oil and gas being shipped from Kuwait that formed the economic basis for Gulf's diverse petroleum sector operations in Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. These last operations were coordinated by Gulf Oil Company, Eastern Hemisphere Ltd (GOCEH) from their offices at 2 Portman Street in London W1.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is often}} {{confusion}} between puppet bids and relays. A puppet bid requests partner to make <b>the</b> <b>cheapest</b> bid {{regardless of his}} hand. A relay bid requests partner to make a descriptive bid in response. The descriptive response can be natural (as in Stayman) or coded (as in Blackwood). A [...] "marionette" [...] bid {{is similar to a}} puppet bid except that it allows responses other than <b>the</b> <b>cheapest</b> bid with certain uncommon hand types. Thus technically it's a relay but with <b>the</b> <b>cheapest</b> bid expected most of the time.|$|R

5|$|Though the Mellotron was not {{extensively}} {{used in the}} 1980s, {{a number}} of bands featured it as a prominent instrument. One of the few UK post-punk bands to do so was Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, who featured it heavily on their platinum-selling 1981 album Architecture & Morality. Andy McCluskey has stated they used the Mellotron because they were starting to run into limitations of <b>the</b> <b>cheap</b> monophonic synthesizers they had used up to that point. He bought a second-hand M400 and was immediately impressed with the strings and choir sounds. XTC's Dave Gregory recalls seeing bands using Mellotrons when {{growing up in the}} 1970s, and thought it would be an interesting addition to the group's sound. He bought a second-hand model in 1982 for £165, and first used it on the album Mummer (1983). IQ's Martin Orford bought a second-hand M400 and used it primarily for visual appeal rather than musical quality or convenience.|$|E
