5|$|Dynastic rulership {{among the}} lowland Maya is most deeply rooted at Tikal. According to later hieroglyphic records, the dynasty {{was founded by}} Yax Ehb Xook, perhaps in the 1st century AD.

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> thick {{filaments}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, arising predominantly {{from the}} body-wall muscles, contain two myosin isoforms and paramyosin as their major proteins.

Tubular structures constitute <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polar regions, and electron-dense material is present in <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central regions (Epstein, H.
