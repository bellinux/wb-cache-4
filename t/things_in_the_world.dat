25|$|Neutral monists {{adhere to}} the {{position}} that perceived <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> {{can be regarded as}} either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> or their relationship to the perceiver. For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.|$|E

25|$|Presence-at-hand {{is not the}} way <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> {{are usually}} encountered, and it is only {{revealed}} as a deficient or secondary mode, e.g., when a hammer breaks it loses its usefulness and appears as merely there, present-at-hand. When a thing is revealed as present-at-hand, it stands apart from any useful set of equipment but soon loses this mode of being present-at-hand and becomes something, for example, that which must be repaired or replaced.|$|E
25|$|Thought is {{a mental}} act that allows humans {{to make sense}} of <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> and to {{represent}} and interpret them in ways that are significant, or which accord with their needs, attachments, goals, commitments, plans, ends, desires, etc. Thinking involves the symbolic or semiotic mediation of ideas or data, as when we form concepts, engage in problem solving, reasoning, and making decisions. Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include deliberation, cognition, ideation, discourse and imagination.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to expert systems, other researchers developed {{the concept of}} frame based languages in the mid 1980s. A frame is similar to an object class: It is an abstract description of a category describing <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> problems, and potential solutions. Frames were originally used on systems geared toward human interaction, e.g. understanding natural language and the social settings in which various default expectations such as ordering food in a restaurant narrow the search space and allow the system to choose appropriate responses to dynamic situations.|$|E

25|$|Rapping {{grew up in}} Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. At a young age, Rapping went to {{demonstrations and}} protests with his mother, Elayne Rapping, a {{community}} organizer, activist and professor in Pittsburgh. Rapping's mother was particularly involved in the anti-war and women’s movements. The experience of working with his activist mother taught Rapping about social justice, and trying to change <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> that aren't fair or right. Friends of Rapping's family were even arrested and he admired the lawyers who worked {{to keep them out}} of jail. After witnessing social justice activism as a young person, Rapping aspired to be a criminal defense attorney at a young age.|$|E

25|$|While {{the term}} magical realism first {{appeared}} in 1955, the term Magischer Realismus, translated as magic realism, was first used by German art critic Franz Roh in 1925 {{to refer to a}} painterly style also known as Neue Sachlichkeit (the New Objectivity), an alternative to expressionism championed by fellow German museum director Gustav Hartlaub. Roh identified magic realism's accurate detail, smooth photographic clarity, and portrayal of the 'magical' nature of the rational world. It reflects the uncanniness of people and our modern technological environment. Roh believed that magic realism was related to, but distinct from, surrealism, due to magic realism's focus on the material object and the actual existence of <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> as opposed to surrealism's more cerebral, psychological and subconscious reality. Magic realism was later used to describe the uncanny realism by American painters such as Ivan Albright, Paul Cadmus, George Tooker and Viennese-born Henry Koerner, along other artists during the 1940s and 1950s. However, in contrast with its use in literature, magic realist art does not often include overtly fantastic or magical content, but rather looks at the mundane through a hyper-realistic and often mysterious lens.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Nigel Cawthorne {{published}} Outraged of Tunbridge Wells, {{a compilation}} of letters to the Tunbridge Wells Advertiser that were viewed as being {{in the style of}} [...] "Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells" [...] from the British Library archives.

500|$|For Fodor, {{significant}} {{parts of}} the mind, such as perceptual and linguistic processes, are structured in terms of modules, or [...] "organs", which he defines by their causal and functional roles. These modules are relatively independent {{of each other and}} of the [...] "central processing" [...] part of the mind, which has a more global and less [...] "domain specific" [...] character. Fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects. This, in turn, makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> The central processing part, on the other hand, takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputs.|$|E

500|$|Aristotle's {{biology is}} {{constructed}} {{on the basis}} of his theory of form, which is derived from Plato's theory of Forms, but significantly different from it. Plato's Forms were eternal and fixed, being [...] "blueprints in the mind of God". Real <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> could, in Plato's view, at best be approximations to these perfect Forms. Aristotle heard Plato's view and developed it into a set of three biological concepts. He uses the same Greek word, [...] (eidos), to mean first of all the set of visible features that uniquely characterised a kind of animal. Aristotle used the word γένος (génos) to mean a kind. For example, the kind of animal called a bird has feathers, a beak, wings, a hard-shelled egg, and warm blood.|$|E
500|$|During the two Zaca expeditions Beebe was {{accompanied}} by his longtime assistant John Tee-Van as well as Jocelyn Crane, a young carcinologist who had first worked for Beebe at Nonsuch Island in 1932, and who would subsequently be among Beebe's most cherished associates {{for the rest of}} his life. Like Hollister before her, Crane would eventually become Beebe's lover during the long expeditions that Beebe made without Elswyth's companionship. During this time Beebe was also forming a close friendship with Winnie-the-Pooh's creator A. A. Milne, who wrote of Half Mile Down [...] "I don't know which I envy you most: all those moral and physical qualities which you have and I lack, or all that wonder of a new world. [...] One of the few <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of which I am really proud is that I know Will Beebe." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{literature}} concerning artificial intelligence, Searle's essay has been {{second only to}} Turing's in the volume of debate it has generated. [...] Searle himself was vague about what extra ingredients {{it would take to}} make a machine conscious: all he proposed was that what was needed was [...] "causal powers" [...] of the sort that the brain has and that computers lack. But other thinkers sympathetic to his basic argument have suggested that the necessary (though perhaps still not sufficient) extra conditions may include the ability to pass not just the verbal version of the Turing test, but the robotic version, which requires grounding the robot's words in the robot's sensorimotor capacity to categorize and interact with the <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> that its words are about, Turing-indistinguishably from a real person. Turing-scale robotics is an empirical branch of research on embodied cognition and situated cognition.|$|E

500|$|It {{was long}} {{suspected}} by several of Britten's close associates {{that there was}} something exceptional about his attraction to teenage boys: Auden referred to Britten's [...] "attraction to thin-as-a-board juveniles... to the sexless and innocent", and Pears once wrote to Britten: [...] "remember there are lovely <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> still– children, boys, sunshine, the sea, Mozart, you and me". In public, the matter was little discussed during Britten's lifetime and much discussed after it. Carpenter's 1992 biography closely examined the evidence, as do later studies of Britten, most particularly John Bridcut's Britten's Children (2006), which concentrates on Britten’s friendships and relationships with various children and adolescents. Some commentators have continued to question Britten's conduct, sometimes very sharply. Carpenter and Bridcut conclude that he held any sexual impulses under firm control and kept the relationships affectionate – including bed-sharing, kissing and skinny dipping – but strictly platonic.|$|E
500|$|Other Coward works {{produced}} in the mid-to-late 1920s included the plays Easy Virtue (1926), a drama about a divorcée's clash with her snobbish in-laws; The Queen Was in the Parlour, a Ruritanian romance; This Was a Man (1926), a comedy about adulterous aristocrats; The Marquise (1927), an eighteenth-century costume drama; Home Chat (1927), a comedy about a married woman's fidelity; and the revues On with the Dance (1925) and This Year of Grace (1928). None of these shows has entered the regular repertoire, but the last introduced one of Coward's best-known songs, [...] "A Room with a View". His biggest failure in this period was the play Sirocco (1927), which concerns free love among the wealthy. It starred Ivor Novello, of whom Coward said, [...] "the two most beautiful <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> are Ivor's profile and my mind". Theatregoers hated the play, showing violent disapproval at the curtain calls and spitting at Coward {{as he left the}} theatre. Coward later said of this flop, [...] "My first instinct was to leave England immediately, but this seemed too craven a move, and also too gratifying to my enemies, whose numbers had by then swollen in our minds to practically the entire population of the British Isles." ...|$|E
