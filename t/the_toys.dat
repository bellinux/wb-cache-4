5|$|Andy's {{toys are}} welcomed {{by the other}} toys at Sunnyside, and are given a tour by Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear ("Lotso"), Big Baby, and Ken. <b>The</b> <b>toys</b> choose to stay, except Woody, who {{attempts}} to return to Andy, but is instead found by Bonnie, one of the Sunnyside students. She brings Woody home and plays with him along with her other toys, which are well-treated. Meanwhile, at Sunnyside, a group of toddlers play rough with Andy's toys. Buzz seeks out Lotso to request to have <b>the</b> <b>toys</b> moved to the older children's room, but Lotso declines. At the same time, Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she inadvertently left in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for <b>the</b> <b>toys.</b> However, before they can leave, Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's gang, guarded by Buzz, whom Lotso switched to Demo Mode (which caused him to believe he is a real space ranger, therefore turning against the other toys). At Bonnie's house, Woody meets a toy clown named Chuckles, who explains to Woody that he, Lotso, and Big Baby once had a beloved owner named Daisy. When <b>the</b> <b>toys</b> were accidentally left behind by Daisy's family during a trip, {{they made their way}} back to her house, where Lotso found that he had been replaced. Lotso lied to Big Baby, saying Daisy had replaced all of them. When they found Sunnyside, Lotso took it over, with Chuckles only getting out because Bonnie took him home, after he was broken, and fixed him.|$|E
5|$|Gimmick! is a {{platform}} game that places the player {{in control of}} a small green blob named Yumetaro. The story begins during an unnamed young girl's birthday. Her father is normally busy with work but {{he is able to}} spend time with his family for the special occasion. Earlier, he had went to the store to purchase a new toy for his daughter. Yumetaro had been wandering the toy store and became confused when the father came in. He hid with stuffed toys that looked like him, but was picked up by the girl's father. When the girl opens the Yumetaro gift, she is delighted. Yumetaro becomes the girl's favorite, and so her other toys no longer feel loved. One night, <b>the</b> <b>toys</b> come alive and take the girl to another dimension. The only one left is Yumetaro, who follows <b>the</b> <b>toys</b> in search of the girl.|$|E

50|$|Baking powder {{is placed}} into a {{compartment}} {{in the bottom}} of <b>the</b> <b>toy</b> which is sealed except for a small hole (or holes). <b>The</b> <b>toy</b> sinks when placed into water, but after a few seconds, enough water leaks in to react with the baking powder and produce carbon dioxide bubbles. The resulting foam creates just enough buoyancy in <b>the</b> <b>toy</b> for it to rise towards the surface of the water. When <b>the</b> <b>toy</b> surfaces, it capsizes, releasing the gas into <b>the</b> air. <b>The</b> <b>toy</b> sinks, beginning <b>the</b> reaction again and repeating the entire process.|$|R
5|$|On December 2, 2014, ABC aired Toy Story That Time Forgot. In the story, <b>the</b> <b>toys</b> {{are trapped}} in room {{with a group of}} {{humanoid}} dinosaur warrior toys called Battlesaurs who do not know that they are toys and must escape.|$|E
5|$|Woody {{returns to}} Sunnyside and learns from a Chatter Telephone toy {{that there is}} only one way out of the daycare: the trash. Woody and Andy's other toys execute their plan, but accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Buzz {{promptly}} allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. <b>The</b> <b>toys</b> reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso and shows proof of Daisy's ownership tag, which Chuckles had kept, to Big Baby. Lotso destroys the tag and says that toys are meant to be discarded, but an enraged Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. As <b>the</b> <b>toys</b> try to leave, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the back of the truck while trying to rescue him, and a falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and normal personality. The truck deposits <b>the</b> <b>toys</b> at a landfill, where they find themselves on a conveyor belt, leading to an incinerator. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. <b>The</b> <b>toys</b> resign themselves to their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens operating an industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who straps him to his truck's radiator grill, and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.|$|E

It will be directed by John Lasseter, and will focus on <b>the</b> <b>toys</b> going to find Bo Peep, who was given away before the third film. Most of the cast of the previous will again reprise their character roles. However Mr. Potato Head will likely be recast for the film because of Don Rickles' death in 2017.|$|E

5|$|Seventeen-year-old Andy {{is about}} to leave for college, and his toys have not been played with for years. He intends to take Woody with him, and puts Buzz Lightyear, Jessie, and the other toys in a trash bag to be stored in the attic. Andy's mother mistakenly takes the bag to the curb for garbage pickup. <b>The</b> <b>toys</b> escape and, believing Andy {{intended}} to throw them away, decide to climb into a donation box with Molly's discarded toy, Barbie, bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody follows them, but is unable to convince them of the mistake.|$|E
5|$|Soon after this, Hasbro {{hosted a}} meeting with Hama, Jim Shooter, Tom DeFalco, Archie Goodwin, and Nelson Yomtov to discuss {{the future of the}} property. It was at this meeting that Goodwin {{suggested}} the idea of Cobra Command as a recurring enemy for G.I. Joe to fight (similar to the HYDRA terrorist organization - recurring enemies to the aforementioned S.H.I.E.L.D. organization). Prior to this, Hasbro had not considered giving G.I. Joe an enemy. Based on the results of this meeting, Hasbro contracted Marvel to produce a comic book series featuring <b>the</b> <b>toys.</b>|$|E
5|$|When I {{would look}} at the films as a whole, I would search for story reasons to use 3-D in {{different}} ways. In Toy Story, for instance, when <b>the</b> <b>toys</b> were alone in their world, I wanted it to feel consistent to a safer world. And when they went out to the human world, that's when I really blew out the 3-D to make it feel dangerous and deep and overwhelming.|$|E

50|$|Lacquering {{may also}} be done on a lathe. For slender and {{delicate}} items, hand-lathe is preferred. A lac stick is pressed against <b>the</b> <b>toy</b> which is fixed to the lathe.

5|$|Andy's toys pursue Al, but {{are caught}} by Zurg, who battles the New Buzz, until Rex {{inadvertently}} knocks {{him off the}} elevator. The new Buzz then chooses to remain behind with Zurg, who has revealed himself as Buzz's father. Accompanied by three toy Aliens, Andy's toys steal a pizza planet delivery truck, and follow Al to the airport, where they enter the baggage handling system. Stinky Pete rips Woody's arm during a struggle, but Andy's toys overthrow Pete, where he ends up into a little girl's backpack. They free Bullseye, only for Jessie to {{end up on the}} plane bound for Japan. Assisted by Buzz and Bullseye, Woody frees Jessie, and <b>the</b> <b>toys</b> find their way home.|$|E
5|$|Bob {{receives}} a package containing his childhood toys, which consist of {{nothing more than}} a scouring pad, a rusted spatula, and a dog-shaped soap bar. <b>The</b> <b>toys</b> make Bob recall memories of constantly working at his father's restaurant, and he realizes that his job deprived him of a normal childhood. Worried that he is doing the same to his own children, he fires Tina, Gene and Louise and encourages them to enjoy their summer vacation. In their place, he hires newly released bank robber Mickey, whom the family had previously befriended, to do various jobs around the restaurant, in exchange for free meals and shelter in the basement.|$|E
5|$|In Andy's room, Woody {{climbs into}} the box with Andy's college supplies, while the other toys ready {{themselves}} for the attic. Woody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, takes <b>the</b> <b>toys</b> to Bonnie's house, and introduces her to them. Bonnie recognizes Woody, who, to Andy's surprise, {{is at the bottom}} of the box. Though hesitant at first, Andy passes Woody on to Bonnie, and then plays with her before leaving. Woody and the other toys witness Andy's departure as they begin their new lives with Bonnie. Meanwhile, Barbie, Ken, and Big Baby have made vast improvements to Sunnyside, and maintain contact with Woody and his friends through letters.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo studies {{examined}} {{the specificity of}} effects of explanation on learning by prompting 3 - to 6 -year-old children to explain a mechanical toy and comparing what they learned about <b>the</b> <b>toy’s</b> causal and non-causal properties with children who only observed <b>the</b> <b>toy,</b> both with and without accompanying verbalization. In Study 1, children were experimentally assigned to either explain or observe <b>the</b> mechanical <b>toy.</b> In Study 2, children were classified according to whether {{the content of their}} response to an undirected prompt involved explanation. Dependent measures included whether children understood <b>the</b> <b>toy’s</b> functional–mechanical relationships, remembered perceptual features of <b>the</b> <b>toy,</b> effectively reconstructed <b>the</b> <b>toy,</b> and (for Study 2) generalized the function of <b>the</b> <b>toy</b> when constructing a new one. Results demonstrate that across age groups, explanation promotes causal learning and generalization but does not improve (and in younger children can even impair) memory for causally irrelevant perceptual details...|$|R
50|$|The {{voice behind}} <b>the</b> popular <b>toy</b> {{was done by}} 23-year-old E. Shapiro. <b>The</b> phrases <b>the</b> <b>toy</b> speaks consist of basic American English words that are {{repeated}} from the child and a pre-set vocabulary of words. Vocabulary is limited on Squawkers McCaw <b>toy</b> birds because <b>the</b> <b>toy</b> is intended for a juvenile audience. As of 2008, all television advertising was pulled from <b>the</b> Squawkers McCaw <b>toy.</b> <b>The</b> <b>toy</b> line was disestablished in 2008.|$|R

5|$|In a {{world where}} toys are living things who pretend to be lifeless when humans are present, a group of toys, owned by six-year-old Andy Davis, are caught off-guard when Andy's {{birthday}} party is moved up a week, as Andy, his mother, and infant sister Molly, are preparing to move the following week. The toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy, a pull-string cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody, organizes the other toys, including Bo Peep the shepherdess, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Slinky Dog, into a scouting mission. Green army men, led by Sarge, spy on the party, and report the results to the others via baby monitors. <b>The</b> <b>toys</b> are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them having been replaced, but then Andy receives a surprise gift – an electronic toy space ranger action figure named Buzz Lightyear, who thinks he is an actual space ranger.|$|E

Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee and Starscream were the only characters present in each version of the script. Arcee was a female Transformer introduced by Orci and Kurtzman, but she was cut because they found it difficult to explain robotic gender; Bay also disliked her motorcycle form, which he found too small. An early idea to have the Decepticons simultaneously strike multiple places around the world was also dropped.|$|E
