5|$|On September 24, 2014, Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), {{launched}} by the Indian Space Research Organisation, reached Mars orbit. ISRO launched MOM on November 5, 2013, {{with the aim of}} analyzing the Martian atmosphere and topography. The Mars Orbiter Mission used a Hohmann transfer orbit to escape Earth's gravitational influence and catapult into a nine-month-long voyage to Mars. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> the first successful Asian interplanetary mission.|$|E
5|$|Planned for May 2018 is {{the launch}} of NASA's InSight lander, along with the twin MarCO CubeSats that will fly by Mars and provide a {{telemetry}} relay for the landing. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> expected to arrive at Mars in November 2018. NASA plans to launch its Mars 2020 astrobiology rover in July or August 2020.|$|E
5|$|The Evangelical Missionary Church of Besançon (French: Église évangélique missionnaire de Besançon), {{formerly}} known as the Evangelical Pentecostal Church of Besançon and <b>The</b> <b>Mission,</b> <b>is</b> a Christian movement established in Besançon, France, in December1963. In close communion with the Protestant Federation of France, this church belongs to the Pentecostal movement and in 1969 founded the Evangelical Missionary Federation (Fédération Évangélique Missionnaire, or FEM) to gather the various Pentecostal churches it created. The assemblies, which developed very quickly throughout eastern and northern France, numbered well over 2,000 members.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> fourth <b>mission</b> in <b>the</b> World Heritage Site, <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> of Concepción, <b>was</b> {{initially}} {{founded in}} 1699 by the Jesuit priests Fr. Francisco Lucas Caballero and Fr. Francisco Hervás. A nearby mission, San Ignacio de Boococas, was incorporated in 1708. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> moved three times: in 1707, 1708 and 1722. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> inhabited by <b>the</b> Chiquitanos, the largest tribe in <b>the</b> region. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> church <b>was</b> constructed between 1752 and 1756, by Fr. Martin Schmid and Fr. Johann Messner. From 1975 to 1996 <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> reconstructed {{as part of}} Hans Roth's restoration project.|$|R
5000|$|The Second Japanese Embassy to Europe (第２回遣欧使節, also [...] ), {{also called}} <b>the</b> Ikeda <b>Mission,</b> <b>was</b> sent on December 29, 1863 by the Tokugawa shogunate. The head of <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> Ikeda Nagaoki, {{governor}} of small villages of Ibara, Bitchū Province (Okayama Prefecture). The assistant head of <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> Kawazu Sukekuni.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> {{burned down}} in 1855 during the Yakima Indian War by US army {{soldiers}} suspicious that the priests had been collaborating with <b>the</b> Yakama's. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> re-established in September 1867 and, {{a few months}} later, was rebuilt {{with the help of}} the Yakama people. <b>The</b> rebuilt <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> finished in 1870.|$|R
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} news footage from 1977, showing the {{discovery}} of water on Mars and a face sculpted into the planet's landscape. Lt. Col. Marcus Aurelius Belt (Ed Lauter), the commander of <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> <b>is</b> plagued by flashbacks of an encounter with the disembodied face during a spacewalk.|$|E
5|$|The shuttle {{has moved}} into direct {{sunlight}} and Mission Control is unable to rotate it into a safe position, putting the astronauts' lives in danger. Generoo believes that the uplink is being sabotaged. Belt orders the uplink to be cut, allowing the astronauts to rotate the craft manually. Over the objections of Generoo and the agents, Belt orders the mission to proceed and lies to the press about its progress. Belt tells Mulder that the shuttle program may be cancelled if <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> not completed successfully.|$|E
5|$|The unlockable vortigaunt mission {{provides}} {{background information}} explaining how the orange crystals {{used by the}} rift-sealing machine in Half Life: Decay are acquired and used by the Nihilanth during the final boss battle in Half Life. The two player-controlled vortigaunts battle through Marines and Black Ops in the underground Black Mesa complex to find the orange crystals {{in the back of}} a military van. At this point the screen fades and <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> declared a success; it is presumed that the Nihilanth warps them back to Xen and installs the crystals in his cave.|$|E
50|$|On {{the way to}} France, <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> visited Egypt, {{where the}} members of <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>were</b> photographed posing before the Sphinx by Antonio Beato, brother of the famous {{photographer}} Felice Beato. The members of <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>were</b> abundantly photographed in Paris by Nadar.|$|R
50|$|Misión Santa Rosa de las Palmas, {{also known}} as Todos Santos <b>Mission,</b> <b>was</b> founded by <b>the</b> Roman Catholic Jesuits in 1733. After 1748, <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> known as Nuestra Señora del Pilar de la Paz. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first European {{settlement}} {{at the site of}} what is now the city of Todos Santos, Baja California Sur. <b>The</b> Santa Rosa <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> located {{in one of the few}} areas of Baja California suitable for agriculture. The residents of <b>the</b> <b>Mission</b> <b>were</b> primarily Guaycura Native Americans (American Indians) whom the Jesuits and their successors, the Franciscans and Dominicans, attempted to convert to Christianity and to make into sedentary farm workers. Recurrent epidemics of introduced European diseases reduced the Indian population to only a handful by the 19th century and in 1825 <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> closed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> not {{reestablished}} until 1605, {{when it was}} rebuilt in the Native American {{village of}} Espogache {{under the direction of}} Friar Diego Delgado. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> modified several times between 1605 and 1680, including the addition of several new structural elements.|$|R
5|$|Crisis Core is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} {{game in which}} the player controls Zack Fair. The player moves Zack through and between open areas, allowing him to talk with non-player characters, interact with the environment, and engage monsters in battle. At save points, the player may opt {{to take one of}} the available side missions, and if so, Zack is moved to a special area to complete the mission, which usually involves defeating one or more monsters. If <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> successfully completed, the player is rewarded with beneficial items, and often new missions become available. Whether the player is successful in the side mission or not, upon completion, Zack is returned to the save point in the main game.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored {{features}} role-playing game elements, such as {{the ability}} to upgrade powers and to make moral choices with a focus on non-linear consequences. The game is designed to allow the player to complete it without killing any non-player characters (NPC), including boss characters and mission targets. An example of a non-lethal situation given by co-creative designer Harvey Smith involved the player completing a side mission for a character, and in return that character had two of Corvo's targets kidnapped and enslaved. Each mission contains multiple ways to explore and reach targets. Movement through and exploration of levels is designed to support the player character's abilities, rather than specific paths that are aimed at a particular gameplay style, such as hacking or sneaking. Specific elements of missions, such as changes to the color of a target's clothing and mask in one mission are randomized, requiring the player to explore the game area to find the target each time <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> played.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2 {{has many}} helpful {{features}} available. The player can target enemies attacking a protected objective or match speeds with them. Power can be shunted between shields, engines, and weapons, thereby allowing faster recharge of shields, afterburners, and weapons {{at the expense}} of other subsystems. These features can be ignored without any detrimental effects on gameplay. The mission parameters are not rigidly fixed, as there is an allowance for the failures of some primary objectives. When <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> concluded, a post-mission briefing will be conducted to discuss the mission, and the performance of the player, before the next mission can be taken on.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, <b>the</b> Middle States <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> {{created with}} Ben E. Rich as {{president}}. However, in 1903, Ephraim H. Nye, president of <b>the</b> Southern States <b>mission,</b> died. He <b>was</b> replaced by Ben E. Rich and {{the boundaries of}} <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> <b>were</b> realigned. In 1904, <b>the</b> Southwestern States <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> renamed <b>the</b> Central States <b>Mission.</b> After <b>the</b> San Francisco earthquake and fire in 1906, <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> headquarters <b>was</b> relocated to Los Angeles from San Francisco. In {{the next few years}} the headquarters of <b>the</b> Central States <b>Mission</b> <b>were</b> moved to Independence, Missouri, and the headquarters of <b>the</b> Northwestern States <b>Mission</b> <b>were</b> moved to Portland, Oregon. By 1907, <b>the</b> Colorado <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> renamed <b>the</b> Western States <b>Mission.</b> Also in these years, the headquarters of <b>the</b> Southern States <b>Mission</b> moved from Chattanooga to Atlanta, Georgia.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> not {{suitably}} prepared.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> longest <b>mission</b> in Space Shuttle history.|$|R
5|$|In the Roman Senate, Cato the Younger {{moves that}} Caesar be {{stripped}} of his command and recalled to Rome to answer charges of misusing his office and illegal warmongering. Pompey, as sole Consul present, vetoes the motion, insisting in trusting Caesar. At the theater that night, Scipio introduces his daughter Cornelia Metella to Pompey as a prospective wife, while Cato warns him that he must ally against Caesar {{before it is too}} late. Pompey again asserts that Caesar means no harm, although privately, he is troubled by Caesar's rising prestige and power and gives orders to one of his slaves who is leaving on a trip to Gaul. At night in the encampment of the 13th Legion, the Aquila (Eagle Standard) is stolen by brigands. To avoid a potentially disastrous drop in morale, Mark Antony orders Vorenus to retrieve it. As Vorenus feels <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> doomed to failure, he has the condemned Pullo released from the stockade to assist him.|$|E
5|$|Samus {{encounters}} heavy {{resistance from}} the Space Pirates, Phazon-corrupted monstrosities, and her fellow bounty hunters who have been corrupted by Dark Samus. Throughout her mission, which eventually takes her to the Space Pirate homeworld, Samus slowly becomes further Phazon-corrupted. She manages to stop the Space Pirate assault {{with the assistance of}} the Galactic Federation navy. As they gain control of a Leviathan battleship, Samus and the Federation fleet create a wormhole and warp to Phaaze—the source of all Phazon in the galaxy. Samus travels to its core, where she finally defeats Dark Samus and then the corrupted Aurora Unit 313. As a result, Dark Samus is obliterated, and Phaaze explodes, rendering all Phazon in the galaxy inert. The Federation fleet escapes Phaaze's destruction, but loses contact with Samus in the process. Eventually, Samus appears in her gunship, and reports that <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> accomplished. Samus then takes off for Elysia, where she reflects on her deceased fellow bounty hunters. If the player completes the game with all of the items collected, Samus is seen flying into hyperspace, with Sylux's spaceship following her.|$|E
5|$|Through the Etherians, Voyager learns of {{an energy}} field being {{projected}} by a gigantic space station, the Forge, which is draining power and preventing repairs from being completed. To counteract {{the effects of}} the field, chief engineer B'Elanna Torres suggests the use of a rare substance called Isodesium, and the Hazard Team is sent on a stealth mission to the scavenger base to steal their supplies of Isodesium. However, <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> a disaster: despite acquiring the Isodesium, one crewman is briefly captured and another team member is critically injured. As the team attempts to extract, Borg drones transport into the extraction point, killing another team member, capturing Lieutenant Foster and taking the Isodesium. In Foster's absence, Munro is made the team leader. Along with Seven of Nine, the team transports to the Borg cube to retrieve the Isodesium. While on the cube, Munro is given the chance to rescue Foster from assimilation by the Borg. Matters are complicated when the Borg corner the team, leveraging their freedom and the Isodesium for assistance against a number of Species 8472 on board, a race highly resistant to the Borg. Although successful, the Borg attempt to assimilate the team; anticipating a double cross, however, Munro has Chang detonate an explosive in a sensitive part of the cube and the team escapes with the Isodesium in the chaos.|$|E
50|$|In 1904 {{the name}} of <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> changed to <b>the</b> Central States <b>Mission.</b> In 1906 Samuel O. Bennion became {{president}} of <b>the</b> <b>mission.</b> In that same year <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> headquarters <b>were</b> moved to Independence, Missouri.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> second ECOMA <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} at 21:30 UTC on 7 July. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> used a Nike-Orion rocket {{launched from}} Andøya, to study Aeronomy. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> flown by ARR and DLR.|$|R
50|$|This {{feature of}} <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> has <b>been</b> {{explained}} by Christopher Anderson, {{who found that}} <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> mostly used by the Wujalwujalwarra ‘mob’ of the Bloomfield River area, on whose land <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> stood. They incorporated the resources available at <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> into their social and economic life. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> provided a reliable source of food and tobacco, and material items, such as farm tools and blankets. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> also used as a ‘caring centre’ where they could leave the elderly, ill and young.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> a non-sectarian {{organisation}} and ignores caste distinctions.|$|E
25|$|The {{engagement}} {{that ended}} <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> {{the only known}} instance in history of one submerged submarine sinking another submerged submarine.|$|E
25|$|Recent reports {{indicate}} that human spaceflight will occur after 2017, on a GSLV-Mk III, as <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> {{not included in the}} government's 12th five-year plan (2012–2017).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> tried {{once more}} on August 5, 1721 as San Francisco de los Neches. As the Nabedache {{were no longer}} {{interested}} in <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> and France had abandoned effort to lay claim in <b>the</b> area, <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> temporarily relocated along the Colorado River in July 1730. Mission Tejas State Park encompasses the original site of <b>the</b> <b>mission.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> {{ended on}} 30 June 2012.|$|R
50|$|C-123 {{aircraft}} <b>were</b> used on <b>the</b> <b>missions.</b> <b>The</b> <b>missions</b> <b>were</b> extensive {{enough to}} have required pre-positioning or maintaining stocks of the herbicides.|$|R
25|$|The primary {{objective}} of <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> {{to develop the}} technologies required for designing, planning, management and operations of an interplanetary mission. The secondary objective is to explore Mars' surface features, morphology, mineralogy and Martian atmosphere using indigenous scientific instruments.|$|E
25|$|Shields are rechargeable; {{they protect}} from damage but are {{depleted}} when absorbing damage. When the player's craft is unshielded, enemy fire will damage the player's hull. Hull damage can disable systems, {{such as the}} engines or targeting computer. Disabled systems will slowly be repaired; TIE Fighter allows the player to choose {{the order in which}} systems are repaired. Hull damage may also cause cockpit displays to break, rendering them useless {{for the remainder of the}} mission. Heavy hull damage will destroy the player's spacecraft. When the player's craft is destroyed before completing a mission, or <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> otherwise a failure, the player can attempt the mission again. However, <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> still successful if the player's craft is destroyed after all primary mission objectives are completed.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} family {{knows that}} the service person may be killed {{in the line of}} duty, but may accept that risk because they understand the values of duty, honor, and country. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>is</b> one in which the brat shares by extension through his military parent.|$|E
5000|$|Mission San José de Tumacácori, the {{presently}} known {{location that}} is a National Historic Park. The farming land around <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> sold at auction in 1834 and <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> abandoned by 1840. It is now a National Monument in Tumacácori National Historical Park in Southern Arizona.|$|R
5000|$|The {{area where}} <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> located is called Walker's Prairie {{to this day}} in honor of Elkanah and Mary Walker. [...] <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>was</b> on <b>the</b> main land route from Walla Walla to Colville, the Fort Walla Walla-Fort Colville Military Road ran {{right in front of}} their homes.|$|R
50|$|In 1859 <b>the</b> <b>Mission</b> <b>was</b> {{returned}} to <b>the</b> Catholic Church. But with the buildings all in ruins, no priests {{were assigned to}} <b>the</b> return <b>mission.</b> Parts <b>were</b> rented to a some small businesses.
