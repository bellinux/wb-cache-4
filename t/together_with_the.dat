5|$|Following the Constitution of May 3, 1791, the senate's competences were altered; in {{most cases}} the {{senators}} could only vote <b>together</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sejm, and the senate's veto powers were limited.

The king, who nominated senators, ministers and other officials, presided over the senate, and could propose new laws <b>together</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> executive government, over which he also presided (the newly created Straż Praw or the Guardianship of Laws).
