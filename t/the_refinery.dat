5|$|On 18 September 1996, an {{enforcement}} {{officer for the}} Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) discovered a hidden pipe, discharging toxic waste from <b>the</b> <b>refinery</b> into Long Lake, {{a tributary of the}} Mississippi River.|$|E
5|$|A church {{close to}} <b>the</b> <b>refinery</b> {{was used as}} a point for {{families}} seeking information on relatives employed at the facility. So many people turned up that police requested that each family send only one representative. At the close of the day of the explosion, six people were missing, with no confirmed deaths. Overnight, several deep-seated fires were uncovered and firefighting continued the next day.|$|E
5|$|According to the United States Geological Survey, {{the world}} mining {{production}} of bismuth in 2014 was 13,600 tonnes, {{with the major}} contributions from China (7,600 tonnes), Vietnam (4,950 tonnes) and Mexico (948 tonnes). <b>The</b> <b>refinery</b> production in 2010 was 16,000 tonnes, of which China produced 13,000, Mexico 850 and Belgium 800 tonnes. The difference reflects bismuth's status as a byproduct of extraction of other metals such as lead, copper, tin, molybdenum and tungsten.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>refinery's</b> {{presence}} {{causes a}} considerable amount of traffic to pass through the village of North Killingholme at the time of work hours commencing and ending. This has caused some disputes with <b>the</b> <b>refinery's</b> neighbouring community.|$|R

5|$|As Geralda moved ashore, the cyclone {{produced}} wind gusts {{as strong}} as , among the strongest gusts worldwide in several decades. The storm also dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides and severe flooding, mostly in Toamasina Province. About 80% {{of the city of}} Toamasina was destroyed, including the country's only petroleum refinery at the time. Damage to <b>the</b> <b>refinery</b> alone was estimated at $800,000.|$|E
5|$|Because sugars burn easily {{when exposed}} to flame, the {{handling}} of sugars risks dust explosion. The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of <b>the</b> <b>refinery,</b> {{was caused by the}} ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is exposed to a heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{journeys}} to Sanchez's {{home in the}} Republic of Isthmus and {{is taken}} onto Sanchez's staff, where he manages to raise Sanchez's suspicions against {{a number of his}} employees. When Bond is taken to Sanchez's main base and drugs refinery, he is recognised by one of Sanchez's men and captured. He escapes, destroying <b>the</b> <b>refinery</b> in the process, and pursues Sanchez, killing him.|$|E
50|$|Paraguana {{currently}} {{contains two}} large oil <b>refineries,</b> and <b>the</b> largest oil <b>refinery</b> complex, <b>the</b> Paraguaná <b>Refinery</b> Complex. Most {{of the oil}} that PDVSA acquires is processed in this complex. Many engineers that worked in <b>the</b> <b>refineries</b> have moved to the United States to work at Citgo.|$|R
50|$|Yet, the German's {{were able}} to rebuild <b>the</b> <b>refineries.</b> In {{a desperate attempt to}} destroy the heart of the German war machine, the Royal Air Force {{deployed}} 700 bombers to flatten the city. The British Empire had succeeded in finally destroying <b>the</b> <b>refineries.</b> This event took place {{a couple of days before}} the Jassy-Kishinev Offensive.|$|R
50|$|In February 2015, a {{nationwide}} strike by USW represented employees {{resulted in the}} closure of <b>the</b> Martinez <b>refinery,</b> <b>the</b> only <b>refinery</b> closure resulting from the strike.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>refinery</b> {{was large}} and old, {{featuring}} outdated construction methods, and these factors {{are believed to have}} contributed to the fire's severity. The origin of the explosion has been narrowed down {{to the center of the}} factory. It was believed to have occurred in a basement beneath storage silos. Investigations conducted by the Department of Justice ruled out deliberate criminal activity in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The sugar {{refinery}} was a four-story {{structure on}} the bank of the Savannah River. Imperial Sugar, based in Sugar Land, Texas, had bought <b>the</b> <b>refinery</b> and its brand name in 1997 from a previous local owner. Known since construction as the Dixie Crystal refinery, it was the main employer in the town of 3,500 prior to the disaster.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the disaster, new safety {{legislation}} was proposed. The local economy declined because the factory was closed down. Imperial intended to rebuild it and return to production by the end of 2008, with replacement buildings to be completed by summer the following year. Some victims filed legal suits for damages against the owner and the company hired to clean up <b>the</b> <b>refinery.</b> Imperial said that the explosion was the main reason for a major loss {{in the first quarter of}} 2008.|$|E

5|$|Cord and Chi {{infiltrate}} Nagarov's base {{to destroy}} the Super Computer. On {{the roof of a}} large tower, Cord destroys a building with a surface-to-air missile launcher to create a diversion. When he meets with Chi again, she is being threatened by Kostov, who thinks she has betrayed his men. Chi kills Kostov before he can pull the trigger. With Chi's help, Cord uses an elevator to go {{to the top of the}} tower and he activates a cable car leading to an island. Cord explores the docking area, and he finds Alexandria in a cell on the security level. Cord uses the main elevator in the complex to access the other levels. Cord creates a diversion and enters level 1, where he inserts the explosive charge into the Super Computer. A cut scene is shown that reveals that Alpha has betrayed him. In a transmission, she tells that premier Nagarov had to be certain that Cord was not acting on her orders when he attacked <b>the</b> <b>refinery.</b> She assured Nagarov that Cord had not entered the facility, but Nagarov had a recording of Cord in <b>the</b> <b>refinery.</b> It resulted in a simple policy shift and the British are now working with the Volgians. As the reactor becomes critical, Nagarov and Lukyan leave the room. Until this moment, the game has taken place in Cord's memory, as he was interrogated by Nagarov after being captured, but from this point on it takes place in real time.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these bank acquisitions, UBS also acquired an 80% stake in Argor SA, a Swiss precious metal refinery founded in 1951, through whom they started to issue UBS branded gold bars. In 1973, the bank increased the stake to full 100% ownership only to withdraw by 1999 with ownership of <b>the</b> <b>refinery</b> changing to Hereaus & Management. Nevertheless, UBS continues to issue gold bars via Argor-Heraeus which is famous for the unique kinebar holographic technology it uses to provide enhanced protection against bank gold bar counterfeiting.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosion}} {{occurred at}} 7:00p.m. local time {{in what was}} initially {{believed to be a}} room where sugar was bagged by workers. Witnesses from across the Savannah River in South Carolina reported seeing flames shoot up several stories high. There were 112 employees on-site at the time. The explosion occurred in the center of <b>the</b> <b>refinery,</b> where bagging and storage facilities were fed completed product by a network of elevators and conveyor belts. Many of the buildings here were six to eight stories high with narrow gaps in between.|$|E
50|$|At {{the height}} of this fire, the loss of <b>the</b> huge, {{sprawling}} <b>refinery</b> complex {{was regarded as a}} real possibility as a tremendous firestorm enveloped two storage tanks, piping, and <b>the</b> <b>refinery’s</b> administration building.|$|R

[...] "The continued work of <b>the</b> oil <b>refineries</b> is critical for the Israeli economy {{during a time of}} war," [...] he said. During the Second Lebanon War in 2006, a number of Katyusha rockets struck Haifa but did not hit <b>the</b> <b>refineries.</b> A direct hit on one of <b>the</b> <b>refineries</b> may cause numerous casualties as a result of leakage of dangerous chemical substances. The port is also the site of a chemical terminal that includes containers of ammonia and ethylene gas.|$|R
50|$|When oil was {{discovered}} in the Maracaibo Basin town of Mene Grande in 1914, {{the fortunes of the}} island were dramatically altered. In the early years, both Shell and Exxon held drilling concessions in Venezuela, which ensured a constant supply of crude oil to <b>the</b> <b>refineries</b> in Aruba and Curaçao. Crude oil production in Venezuela was inexpensive. The integrated companies Shell and Exxon controlled the entire industry from pumping, transporting and refining to marketing the end product. <b>The</b> <b>refineries</b> on Aruba and Curaçao operated in global markets and were profitable partly because of the margin between the production costs of crude oil and the revenues realized on products. This provided a safety net for losses incurred through inefficiency or excessive operating costs at <b>the</b> <b>refineries.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{explosion}} seriously {{weakened the}} structure of the facility, leaving it highly unstable, and there was extensive smoke damage. The packaging area was totally destroyed and in all, 12% of <b>the</b> <b>refinery</b> was demolished by the explosion. Removal of debris began the day after the accident, with assistance from structural engineers. The six missing persons were all found dead that day, three of them in tunnels running beneath the factory. The final death toll was thirteen. It was the first major shutdown of a US sugar refinery since American Sugar Refining Inc.'s Domino Sugar shut down its plant in Chalmette, Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|While other {{refineries}} {{would keep}} the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel <b>the</b> <b>refinery,</b> and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.|$|E
5|$|Abraham Waddington {{was born}} in Clayton, Bradford, on 4 February 1893, the eldest of three brothers. His family owned a fat-refining {{business}} managed by his father, Sam. When he left school, Waddington joined the family firm as a lorry driver, occasionally working in <b>the</b> <b>refinery.</b> He began playing cricket for Crossley Hall in the West Bradford League {{at the age of}} 11; as a teenager he played in the Bradford League for Lidget Green and then Laisterdyke, gaining a local reputation as a fast-medium bowler. He helped Laisterdyke win the League championship in 1913, before moving to Wakefield for the 1914 season, where he took 98 wickets at an average of 12.00. He played for Yorkshire Second XI in August 1914, alongside future First XI teammates Herbert Sutcliffe and Cec Tyson, but the outbreak of the First World War prevented him making any further appearances for the county.|$|E

5|$|On October15, the {{governor}} of the United States Virgin Islands announced the final preparations for Hurricane Omar as he signed a State of Emergency declaration for the territory. Public schools would be closed on October16. All non-essential workers would be dismissed at 10 a.m. local time. At 6 p.m. curfew was put in place for the same day. Only those with valid passes would be allowed to be out after the curfew was put in place. That same day, a Hurricane Warning and flash flood watch were put in place in anticipation of hurricane-force winds and torrential rains from Omar. The American Red Cross planned to open shelters throughout the islands before the hurricane struck. Sandbags were also being distributed in St. Croix. A large oil refinery, which produces , was shut down and only necessary workers remained at <b>the</b> <b>refinery.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Travel Inn in Tujunga, California, was repainted {{and used}} as the {{interior}} of Leonard's and Dodd's motel rooms and {{the exterior of the}} film's Discount Inn. Scenes in Sammy Jankis' house were shot in a suburban home close to Pasadena, while Natalie's house was located in Burbank. The crew planned to shoot the derelict building set (where Leonard kills Teddy and Jimmy) in a Spanish-styled brick building owned by a train company. However, one week before shooting began, the company placed several dozen train carriages outside the building, making the exterior unfilmable. Since the interior of the building had already been built as a set, a new location had to be found. An oil refinery near Long Beach was used instead, and the scene where Leonard burns his wife's possessions was filmed {{on the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>refinery.</b>|$|E
5|$|From late June the 315thBombardment Wing {{conducted}} {{a series of}} night precision bombing attacks against the Japanese oil industry, independently of the precision day and night incendiary raids. The wing's B-29s were fitted with the advanced AN/APQ-7 radar that allowed targets to be accurately located at night. Arriving in the Marianas in April 1945, the 315th underwent a period of operational training before flying its first attack against the Utsube Oil Refinery at Yokkaichi on the night of 26June. The 30 bombers (out of 38 dispatched) that struck <b>the</b> <b>refinery</b> destroyed or damaged 30percent of the facility. The unit's next attack was against a refinery at Kudamatsu three nights later, and on the night of 2July it struck another refinery at Minoshima. On the night of 6/7July the 315thBombardment Wing destroyed the Maruzen oil refinery near Osaka, and three nights later it completed the destruction of the Utsube refinery. The wing had conducted 15 operations against Japanese oil facilities {{by the end of the}} war. During these attacks it destroyed six of the nine targets attacked for the loss of four B-29s. However, as Japan had almost no crude oil to refine due to the Allied naval blockade of the home islands these raids had little impact on the country's war effort.|$|E
