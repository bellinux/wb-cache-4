5|$|The Jakarta Post was {{the brainchild}} of Information Minister Ali Murtopo and {{politician}} Jusuf Wanandi. Murtopo and Wanandi were disappointed at the perceived bias against Indonesia in foreign news sources. At the time, there were two English-language dailies, The Indonesia Times and The Indonesian Observer. However, due to negative public perception regarding the existing papers they decided to create a new one. In order to ensure credibility, the two agreed <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>a</b> group of competing newspapers (the Golkar-backed Suara Karya, the Catholic-owned Kompas, the Protestant-owned Sinar Harapan, and the weekly Tempo) to back the nascent paper. It was hoped to become a quality English-language paper, similar to The Straits Times in Singapore, the Bangkok Post in Thailand, and the New Straits Times in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of forensic {{science and the}} ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible {{at the time of the}} original examination. Combined with the removal of the double jeopardy law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>a</b> jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has occurred. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.|$|E
5|$|The first popular {{rock music}} bootleg {{resulted}} from Bob Dylan's activities between largely disappearing {{from the public}} eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966, {{and the release of}} John Wesley Harding at the end of 1967. After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially recorded and released himself, demand increased for these recordings, particularly when they started airing on local radio in Los Angeles. Through various contacts in the radio industry, a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a reel to reel tape containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers and wondered if {{it would be possible to}} manufacture them on an LP. They managed <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>a</b> local pressing plant to press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies discreetly, paying in cash and avoiding using real names or addresses. Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve, due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies, the LP was issued in a plain white cover with Great White Wonder rubber stamped on it. Subsequently, Dylan became one of the most popular artists to be bootlegged with numerous releases.|$|E

The writer John Guare was a friend of Inger McCabe Elliott and her husband Osborn Elliott. In October 1983 Hampton came to the Elliott's New York apartment and they allowed him to spend the night. The next morning Inger Elliott found Hampton in bed with another man and later called the police. The Elliotts told Guare about the story and it inspired him to write the play years later.|$|E
25|$|Peace with England and France {{implied that}} Spain could focus her {{energies}} on restoring her rule to the Dutch provinces. The Dutch, led by Maurice of Nassau, {{the son of}} William the Silent had succeeded in taking a number of border cities since 1590, including the fortress of Breda. Following the peace with England, the new Spanish commander Ambrosio Spinola pressed hard against the Dutch. Spinola, a general of abilities to match Maurice, was prevented from conquering the Netherlands only by Spain's renewed bankruptcy in 1607. Fortunately, Spanish forces had regained enough of the military initiative <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>a</b> politically divided United Provinces to sign a truce in 1609.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of his deception, Reavis managed <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>a</b> number of {{prominent}} persons to support his efforts. He obtained legal and political support from Roscoe Conkling, Robert G. Ingersoll and James Broadhead. Business leaders such as Charles Crocker and John W. Mackay in turn provided financial support. Initial exposure of the fraud occurred when an unfavorable Surveyor General report caused the claim to be summarily dismissed. In response to this action, Reavis sued the U.S. government for US$11 million in damages ($ in present-day terms). The suit in turn prompted the U.S. government to perform a detailed investigation that fully exposed the forgeries Reavis had planted in a variety of locations.|$|E

50|$|However, a false {{document}} {{is also a}} technique employed to create verisimilitude in a work of fiction. By inventing and inserting documents {{that appear to be}} factual, an author tries {{to create a sense of}} authenticity beyond the normal and expected suspension of disbelief for a work of art. The goal of a {{false document}} is <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>an</b> audience that what is being presented is factual.|$|R

Edward finds it difficult to live without Bella, and becomes severely depressed at the prospect of an infinitely long and meaningless life. After he mistakenly learns from his sister Rosalie that Bella has committed suicide, Edward attempts <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>a</b> group of Italian vampires, the Volturi, to kill him. Together with his sister Alice, Bella rushes to Italy and stops Edward before the Volturi can destroy him.|$|E
25|$|Polygyny once {{practiced by}} leaders has nearly disappeared, {{possibly}} {{from the pressure}} missionaries put on them. Most marriages are now consecrated by a Catholic priest. Divorce is not uncommon and is initiated by either spouse. A village leader may get involved and try <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>a</b> couple to stay together. The nuclear family along with a grandparent is the common arrangement in a household. Often {{a man who is}} leader will surround his large house with smaller homes for his sons' and daughters' families. As an essential part of their way of life, young children act as a companion to adults. They stay with their mothers and help with house and garden work.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{discouraged}} in {{her efforts}} to follow the instruction she had received in her visions, Alacoque was eventually able to convince her superior, Mother de Saumaise, of the authenticity of her visions. She was unable, however, <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>a</b> group of theologians {{of the validity of}} her apparitions, nor was she any more successful with many of the members of her own community, and suffered greatly at their hands. She eventually received the support of St. Claude de la Colombière, S.J., the community's confessor for a time, who declared that the visions were genuine. In 1683, opposition in the community ended when Mother Melin was elected Superior and named Margaret Mary her assistant. She later became Novice Mistress, and saw the monastery observe the Feast of the Sacred Heart privately, beginning in 1686. Two years later, a chapel was built at Paray-le-Monial to honor the Sacred Heart.|$|E
50|$|The circumstantial fallacy {{does not}} apply where the source is taking a {{position}} by using a logical argument based solely on premises that are generally accepted. Where the source seeks <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>an</b> audience of the truth of a premise by a claim of authority or by personal observation, observation of their circumstances may reduce the evidentiary weight of the claims, sometimes to zero.|$|R
50|$|In nuclear strategy, a second-strike {{capability}} is a country's assured {{ability to respond}} to a nuclear attack with powerful nuclear retaliation against the attacker. To have such <b>an</b> ability (and <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>an</b> opponent of its viability) is considered vital in nuclear deterrence, as otherwise the other side might attempt to try to win a nuclear war in one massive first strike against its opponent's own nuclear forces.|$|R
