5|$|In early 1942, the {{situation}} in the Pacific grew worse as the garrison at Singapore fell and the Japanese began to advance south towards Australia. In March, <b>they</b> <b>landed</b> Lae and Salamaua on the north coast of New Guinea, and then later in July <b>they</b> <b>landed</b> at Buna and Gona in Papua. By this time the Australian government decided to bring the units of the 2nd AIF back from the Middle East to defend against a possible Japanese invasion of Australia and although this process had begun, the only troops available to respond immediately to the Japanese landings were units from the Militia. Troops from the 30th Brigade had already been deployed around Port Moresby, however, {{over the course of a}} month in July and August the 61st Battalion, along with the rest of the 7th Brigade, was moved to Milne Bay, situated on the eastern tip of New Guinea, where the 61st took up defensive duties around the airstrip at Gili Gili alongside the 25th Battalion.|$|E
5|$|By noon, Knyphausen and his Hessians {{restarted}} their advance. As soon as {{the tide}} was high enough, Mathew and his troops, accompanied by Howe, were ferried across the Harlem River. <b>They</b> <b>landed</b> under heavy fire from the American artillery on the Manhattan shore. The British troops charged up the hillside and dispersed the Americans until they reached a redoubt defended by some Pennsylvania Volunteer companies. After brief fighting, the Americans turned and ran towards the fort.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the nine}} {{companies}} {{landing in the}} first wave, only Company A of the 116th RCT at Dog Green and the Rangers to their right landed where intended. E/116, aiming for Easy Green, ended up scattered across the two beaches of the 16th RCT area. G/116, aiming for Dog White, opened up a 1,000-yard (900m) gap between themselves and A/116 to their right when <b>they</b> <b>landed</b> at Easy Green instead. I/16 drifted so far east it did not land for another hour and a half.|$|E

5|$|On 21November, {{a conference}} between GHQ, Kenney, Carpender and Barbey {{was held in}} Brisbane at which {{it was decided to}} land a small force in the Arawe area. This {{operation}} had three goals: to divert Japanese attention from Cape Gloucester, to provide a base for PT boats, and to establish a defensive perimeter and make contact with the Marines once <b>they</b> <b>landed.</b> It was intended that PT boats operating from Arawe would disrupt Japanese barge traffic along the southern shore of New Britain and protect the Allied naval forces at Cape Gloucester from attack.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Infantry Division did {{not meet}} all their D-Day {{objectives}} at Utah, partly because they had arrived {{too far to the}} south, but <b>they</b> <b>landed</b> 21,000 troops at the cost of only 197 casualties. Airborne troops arriving by parachute and glider numbered an additional 14,000 men, with 2,500 casualties. Around 700 men were lost in engineering units, 70th Tank Battalion, and LCTs and other vessels sunk by the enemy. German losses are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Bishops Court was a {{shift in}} Brilliants focus from {{capturing}} French privateers to direct engagement with an enemy naval squadron. Between 21 and 26 February 1760 a force of three French vessels, the 44-gun Maréchal de Belle-Isle, the 36-gun Blonde and the 30-gun Terpsichore, arrived {{off the coast of}} Ireland. Under the command of privateer François Thurot, <b>they</b> <b>landed</b> 600 French troops and captured the town of Carrickfergus. Thurot held the town for five days.|$|E

5|$|The Normans {{crossed to}} England {{a few days}} after Harold's victory over the Norwegians at Stamford Bridge on 25 September, {{following}} the dispersal of Harold's naval force. <b>They</b> <b>landed</b> at Pevensey in Sussex on 28 September and erected a wooden castle at Hastings, from which they raided the surrounding area. This ensured supplies for the army, and as Harold and his family held many of the lands in the area, it weakened William's opponent and made him more likely to attack {{to put an end to}} the raiding.|$|E
5|$|The navy sailed from Chile on 20 August 1820. It was {{composed}} of eight warships, eleven gunboats, 247 cannons and a crew of 1,600, most of them Chileans. There were 12 frigates, and a brig with the 4,000 soldiers of the Army of the Andes. San Martín {{was the leader of}} the military expedition. <b>They</b> <b>landed</b> in Paracas, 200km to the south of Lima, on 7 September, and occupied the nearby city of Pisco, which was abandoned by the royalists.|$|E

5|$|Andrew {{sold and}} mortgaged royal estates to finance his campaign, which {{became part of}} the wider Fifth Crusade. He renounced his claim to Zadar in favor of the Republic of Venice so that he could secure {{shipping}} for his army. He entrusted Hungary to Archbishop John of Esztergom, and gave Croatia and Dalmatia to Pontius de Cruce, the Templar Prior of Vrana. In July 1217, Andrew departed from Zagreb, accompanied by Leopold VI of Austria and Otto I, Duke of Merania. His army was so largeat least 10,000 mounted soldiers and uncountable infantrymenthat most of it stayed behind when Andrew and his men embarked in Split two months later. The ships transported them to Acre, where <b>they</b> <b>landed</b> in October.|$|E
5|$|As the Chinese Civil War was raging at {{the time}} and Communist forces were attacking river boats {{travelling}} from Chongqing, it was judged necessary to transport the pig bristles from the city by air. The Kuomintang government agreed to allow RAAF and Royal Air Force aircraft to fly return flights between Hong Kong and Chongqing between 1 and 14 May only. After arriving in Hong Kong, the bristles would be shipped to Australia by sea. Both the Kuomintang government and the Communist forces were concerned about the presence of foreigners in China, and the Australian aircrew were warned that they would be imprisoned if <b>they</b> <b>landed</b> anywhere other than Chongqing or an emergency airstrip at Canton.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, Operation Mallard began. Mallard was {{the final}} wave of the 6th Airborne Division's {{landings}} and consisted of 220 Horsa and Hamilcar gliders, carrying the 6th Airlanding Brigade and other units. The gliders arrived at their landing-zone, coming under heavy small-arms and mortar fire from nearby German positions as <b>they</b> <b>landed.</b> Casualties were light and within ninety minutes the glider-borne troops had gathered at their rendezvous points. By 00:00 7 June, the entire 6th Airborne Division had been fully deployed on the eastern flank of the invasion beaches (with the exception of 12th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment – part of 6th Airlanding Brigade – that was due to arrive by sea on 7 June).|$|E

5|$|Blake {{arrived at}} St Helen's Pool in April 1651 {{and set about}} taking the island of Tresco, attacking the harbour of Old Grimsby and the blockhouse. Blake {{deployed}} a force of men in small boats, but <b>they</b> <b>landed</b> on the wrong island {{and had to be}} recalled to the ships. The next day the men landed on the beaches below the blockhouse; fighting ensued and the attackers were driven back. Blake's men made another landing which also saw fierce resistance, and the guns of the blockhouse were probably turned on the landing parties. Around 15 of the assault force were killed, but the guns of Blake's ships guns had a longer range than those of the blockhouse and Old Grimsby fell. Blake went on to use Tresco as a basis for taking St Mary's.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{continued}} west up the Thames Valley, reaching Gloucester between 9 and 12 October; {{he hoped}} to reach Wales and from there mobilise an army against the invaders. Mortimer and Isabella were not far behind. Proclamations condemned the Despensers' recent regime. Day-by-day they gathered new supporters Edward and the younger Despenser crossed over the border and set sail from Chepstow, probably aiming first for Lundy and then for Ireland, where the King hoped to receive refuge and raise a fresh army. Bad weather drove them back, though, and <b>they</b> <b>landed</b> at Cardiff. Edward retreated to Caerphilly Castle and attempted to rally his remaining forces.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} the 61st Battalion {{took part in the}} surrender ceremony that took place at Torokina. Later, as they were waiting for repatriation back to Australia, the battalion was employed guarding Japanese prisoners of war. In November orders arrived for the battalion to return to Australia and after embarking on the Westralia, <b>they</b> <b>landed</b> at Cairns on 19 November 1945, and moved back to Brisbane by train. As the battalion's strength dwindled {{as a result of the}} demobilisation process and men returned to civilian life, the decision was made to disband the unit. This occurred on 8 January 1946 at Victoria Barracks, Brisbane.|$|E

5|$|Guest and Knowles were {{summoned to}} the Defence Department and told to stop recruiting. The Administration had decided to raise a {{regiment}} in Rhodesia, and Guest joined the Salisbury battalion of the 1st Rhodesian Regiment with the rank of Lieutenant. The battalion was sent to South Africa to assist in suppressing the 1914 Maritz Rebellion by Boers opposed to fighting for Britain. It was not, however, deployed against the Rebellion and when it ended the battalion was sent, with the Imperial Light Horse, to reinforce the South African troops in the South-West Africa Campaign in German South-West Africa, present-day Namibia. <b>They</b> <b>landed</b> at Lambert's Bay on Christmas morning 1914, but made no contact with the enemy until they were sent to Swakopmund.|$|E
5|$|However, landing paratroopers, and {{especially}} gliders, without {{the cover of}} darkness left them exceedingly vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. The official history of the British Airborne Divisions highlights {{the cost of this}} trade-off, stating that of the 416 gliders that landed, only 88 remained undamaged by enemy fire, and that between 20–30percent of the glider pilots were casualties. Another historian argues that the gliders landing in daylight was a calamity, with the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment having two-thirds of their gliders hit by ground fire and suffering heavy casualties as <b>they</b> <b>landed.</b> The casualty rates were worsened by the slow rates of release and descent of the gliders themselves, and the fact that each aircraft towed two gliders, slowing them even further; as the time to release a glider unit was 3–4 times longer than a parachute unit, the gliders were vulnerable to flak.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, Shea and his ASPO colleagues at Houston boarded a NASA plane to the Kennedy Space Center. <b>They</b> <b>landed</b> at about 1:00a.m., only five {{hours after the}} fire had broken out.
