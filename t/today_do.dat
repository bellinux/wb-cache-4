However, there is pictorial evidence from pottery and tombs in Ancient Egypt suggesting that spotting patterns may have existed on ancestral Arabian-type horses in antiquity. Nonetheless, purebred Arabians <b>today</b> <b>do</b> not carry genes for pinto or Leopard complex ("Appaloosa") spotting patterns, except for sabino.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday 7 August, {{following}} a Monday bank holiday, prostitute Martha Tabram was murdered at about 2:30am. Her {{body was found}} at George Yard Buildings, George Yard, Whitechapel. She had been stabbed 39times with a short blade. On the basis of statements from a fellow prostitute, and PC Thomas Barrett who was patrolling nearby, Inspector Reid put soldiers at the Tower of London and Wellington Barracks on an identification parade, but without positive results. The police did not connect the murder with Smith's, but they did connect it with the later murders. Most experts <b>today</b> <b>do</b> not connect it with the other killings, as Tabram was stabbed whereas the later victims were slashed, but a connection cannot be ruled out.|$|E
25|$|The test {{measures}} {{the concentration of}} specific IgE antibodies in the blood. Quantitative IgE test results increase the possibility of ranking how different substances may affect symptoms. A {{rule of thumb is}} that the higher the IgE antibody value, the greater the likelihood of symptoms. Allergens found at low levels that <b>today</b> <b>do</b> not result in symptoms can nevertheless help predict future symptom development. The quantitative allergy blood result can help determine what a patient is allergic to, help predict and follow the disease development, estimate the risk of a severe reaction, and explain cross-reactivity.|$|E

25|$|Universal Disk Format (UDF) version 1.50 {{and above}} has {{facilities}} to support rewritable discs like sparing tables and virtual allocation tables, spreading usage {{over the entire}} surface of a disc and maximising life, but many older operating systems do not support this format. Packet-writing utilities such as DirectCD and InCD are available but produce discs that are not universally readable (although based on the UDF standard). The Mount Rainier standard addresses this shortcoming in CD-RW media by running the older file systems {{on top of it}} and performing defect management for those standards, but it requires support from both the CD/DVD burner and the operating system. Many drives made <b>today</b> <b>do</b> not support Mount Rainier, and many older operating systems such as Windows XP and below, and Linux kernels older than 2.6.2, do not support it (later versions do). Essentially CDs/DVDs are a good way to record {{a great deal of information}} cheaply and have the advantage of being readable by most standalone players, but they are poor at making ongoing small changes to a large collection of information. Flash drives' ability to do this is their major advantage over optical media.|$|E
500|$|Stone {{went with}} her {{daughter}} to Chicago in May, 1893 and gave her last public speeches at the World's Congress of Representative Women where she saw a strong international involvement in women's congresses, with almost 500 women from 27 countries speaking at 81 meetings, and attendance topping 150,000 at the week-long event. Stone's immediate focus was on state referenda under consideration in New York and Nebraska. Stone presented a speech she had prepared entitled [...] "The Progress of Fifty Years" [...] wherein she described the milestones of change, and said [...] "I think, with never-ending gratitude, that the young women of <b>today</b> <b>do</b> not and can never know at what price their {{right to free speech}} and to speak at all in public has been earned." [...] Stone met with Carrie Chapman Catt and Abigail Scott Duniway to form a plan for organizing in Colorado, and Stone attended two days of meetings about getting a woman suffrage drive restarted in Kansas.

2500|$|The {{status of}} women in Pakistan is one of {{systemic}} gender subordination even though it varies considerably across classes, regions, and the rural/urban divide due to uneven socioeconomic development and the impact of tribal, feudal, and capitalist social formations on women's lives.

The August convention chose St. Laurent as the new leader of the Liberal Party. Three months later, King retired after 22 years as prime minister. King also had the most terms (six) as Prime Minister. Sir John A. Macdonald was second-in-line, with 19 years, as the longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history (1867–1873, 1878–1891). King was not charismatic {{and did not have}} a large personal following.

2500|$|The term [...] "Chunchucmil" [...] was {{originally}} used {{to name a}} freshwater well (Ch'en Chun Chukum), the central water source for the cattle ranch that eventually grew to become the historic henequen hacienda of Chunchucmil. [...] Most wells in this region are named after animals or plants. [...] In this case, the words Ch'en Chun Chukum literally mean [...] "the well {{at the base of}} the Chukum tree" [...] (Havardia albicans). [...] Local Maya speakers still refer to the modern village of Chunchucmil as Chun Chukum when speaking in their native tongue. [...] The ancient Maya archaeological site was given the name Chunchucmil by archaeologists in the 1970s because that was the closest modern community to the site center.

2500|$|The Quinnipiac Stone Giant Twins (Hobbomock and Maushop), as {{the primary}} culture heroes, acted as the epitomes of good and bad, right and wrong, honorable deeds and mischievous behavior. The Puritans refused to {{acknowledge}} any of this. Religious conversion and cultural ethnocide operated to redefine many Quinnipiac ancient traditions and language definitions. For example, the Puritan families refused to honor Quinnipiac teachings. Hobbomock was, to the Quinnipiac, a benevolent spirit who taught the people how to hunt, fish, and survive the Ice Age, earthquakes, famines, etc., {{and he was the}} one prayed to when assistance was needed. The Puritans knew this, yet they forced the Long Water people to teach the children that Hobbomock was a “Bogeyman.” The Puritans redefined Hobbomock, Maushop, and other Quinnipiac spirit helpers as “devils.” [...] Today some believe that the Quinnipiac have vanished from the earth. As the motto of the New England Algonquian Alliance proudly proclaimed after the passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act in 1978, “WE ARE STILL HERE”; so <b>today</b> <b>do</b> the Quinnipiac.|$|E

Sima Zhao replied, [...] "Have you forgotten what you said previously? Why are you asking me not to go (to Chang'an) now? Please keep secret what we spoke about. I treat people with trust and respect. As long as they remain loyal to me, I will not doubt them. Jia Chong recently asked me, 'Are you suspicious of Zhong Hui?'

2500|$|The {{presence}} of incorporated boroughs in Connecticut and incorporated villages in Vermont has influenced {{the evolution of}} cities in those states. In Connecticut in particular, {{the historical development of}} cities was quite different from in the other New England states, and at least technically, the relationship between towns and cities is even today different from elsewhere in New England. Just as boroughs in Connecticut overlay towns, so do cities; for example, while Hartford is commonly thought of as a city, it is coextensive and consolidated with the Town of Hartford; governed by a single governmental entity with the powers and responsibilities of the Town being carried out by the entity referred to as the City of Hartford. [...] In legal theory though not in current practice Connecticut cities and boroughs could be coextensive (covering the same geography as the town) without being consolidated (a single government); also a borough or city can span more than one town. In practice, though, most cities in Connecticut <b>today</b> <b>do</b> not function any differently from their counterparts elsewhere in New England.
