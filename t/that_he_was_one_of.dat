5|$|As 2015 began, Ruf {{once again}} {{had to fight}} for playing time; there was no clear opening {{for him on the}} Phillies' roster, {{notwithstanding}} the fact <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the few players on the roster with the ability to hit for power.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{historian}} Władysław Konopczyński, {{who wrote}} a monograph on Pulaski in 1931, noted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most accomplished Polish people, grouping him with other Polish military heroes such as Tadeusz Kościuszko, Stanisław Żółkiewski, Stefan Czarniecki, and Prince Józef Poniatowski.|$|E
5|$|He came to play 15 league games {{during the}} spring season, helping the team reach the {{second place in the}} league. He was noted for six assists, which placed him third in the assist-table and which made him the defender with the most assists of the 2014–15 season – despite playing {{less than half of the}} games. Defensively Copenhagen only conceded goals in six games, with many experts {{claiming}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the best players of the spring season.|$|E

5|$|In Austria, Kepler {{left behind}} such a {{historical}} legacy <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the motifs of a silver collector's coin: the 10-euro Johannes Kepler silver coin, minted on September 10, 2002. The reverse {{side of the}} coin has a portrait of Kepler, who spent some time teaching in Graz and the surrounding areas. Kepler was acquainted with Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg personally, and he probably influenced the construction of Eggenberg Castle (the motif of the obverse of the coin). In front of him on the coin is the model of nested spheres and polyhedra from Mysterium Cosmographicum.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 472 BC, Pericles {{presented}} The Persians of Aeschylus at the Greater Dionysia as a liturgy, demonstrating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the wealthier men of Athens. Simon Hornblower has argued that Pericles' selection of this play, which presents a nostalgic picture of Themistocles' famous victory at Salamis, shows that the young politician was supporting Themistocles against his political opponent Cimon, whose faction succeeded in having Themistocles ostracized shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Statistical {{rating systems}} give Steinitz a rather low ranking among world champions, mainly because he took several long breaks from {{competitive}} play. However, an analysis {{based on one}} of these rating systems shows <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most dominant players {{in the history of the}} game. Steinitz was unbeaten in match play for 32 years, from 1862 to 1894.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, Model {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} as a capable officer with great potential. Early on in his military career, Model had written a book on the Prussian general August Neidhardt von Gneisenau. In addition, he was already known to Hans von Seeckt, head of the slimmed-down Reichswehr, from his staff postings during the war, and he was equipped with an excellent reference from Major-General Franz von Rantau, commander of the 36th Reserve Division. It was thus no surprise <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the 4,000 officers retained in the Reichswehr. Model generally kept away from politics in the chaotic period that marked the birth of the Weimar Republic, although as an army officer he was involved in the bloody suppression of the 1920 communist uprising in the Ruhr.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} Columbia University, {{where he}} received a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1945 and, eleven years later, his PhD in economics in 1956. The delay in receiving his PhD was {{due in part to}} conflict with his advisor, Joseph Dorfman, and in part to Arthur Burns rejecting his doctoral dissertation. Burns was a longtime friend of the Rothbard family and their neighbor at their Manhattan apartment building. It was only after Burns went on leave from the Columbia faculty to head President Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisors that Rothbard's thesis was accepted and he received his doctorate. Rothbard later stated that all of his fellow students there were extreme leftists and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> only two Republicans on the Columbia campus at the time.|$|E
5|$|Tintin and Haddock later realise that Calculus {{has gone}} missing, and surmise {{that he has}} been kidnapped by the same {{individual}} who placed Tarragon in a coma. The police set up road blocks, but the kidnappers switch cars and are able to evade them. Tintin visits a hospital where the seven stricken members of the Sanders-Hardiman expedition are housed; he is astonished that at a precise time of day, all awaken and scream about figures attacking them before slipping back into their comas. Haddock is dejected by Calculus' abduction, but upon learning that police have spotted the kidnapper's car at a port, he and Tintin race there, believing that the abductors seek to board a boat with Calculus and take him abroad. At the docks, they spot Alcazar boarding a ship to South America; he reveals that Chiquito has disappeared and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the last descendants of the Inca, with Tintin surmising that Chiquito must be one of Calculus' captors.|$|E

5|$|As the war progressed, Hitler's {{attention}} became {{focused on}} foreign affairs and {{the conduct of the}} war, to the exclusion of all else. Hess, not directly engaged in either of these endeavours, became increasingly sidelined from the affairs of the nation and from Hitler's attention; Bormann had successfully supplanted Hess in many of his duties and usurped his position at Hitler's side. Also concerned that Germany would face a war on two fronts as plans progressed for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union scheduled to take place in 1941, Hess boldly decided to attempt to bring Britain to the negotiating table by travelling there himself to seek meetings with the British government. He asked the advice of Albrecht Haushofer, who suggested several potential contacts in Britain. Hess settled on fellow aviator Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton, whom he had never met. On Hess's instructions, Haushofer wrote to Hamilton in September 1940, but the letter was intercepted by MI5 and Hamilton did not see it until March 1941. Hamilton was chosen in the mistaken belief <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the leaders of an opposition party opposed to war with Germany, and because he was a friend of Haushofer.|$|E

25|$|Al-Mas‘udi knew leading Mu'tazilites, {{including}} al-Jubba, al-Nawbakhti, ibn Abdak al-Jurjani and Abu'l Qasim al-Balkhi al-Ka'bi.

His reasoning, his phraseology, his expressed high esteem for Mu'tazilities could suggest <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their number. However, Shboul points out that his extant works do not specifically state that he was.|$|E

25|$|With {{the same}} tactics and strength, América de Cali went for their fourth star. With minor {{changes in the}} team, it looked to head for their third {{consecutive}} title.
