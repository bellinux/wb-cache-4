5000|$|Prior to the {{reliability}} of the printing press, the oral tradition was considered more <b>trustworthy</b> than <b>written</b> texts. The accuracy of the oral gospel tradition was insured by the community designating certain learned individuals to bear the main responsibility for retaining the gospel message of Jesus. The prominence of teachers in the earliest communities such as the Jerusalem Church is best explained by the communities' reliance on them as repositories of oral tradition. One of the most striking features to emerge from recent study is the [...] "amazing consistency" [...] {{of the history of the}} tradition [...] "which gave birth to the NT".|$|R
40|$|Before sound came, {{film was}} a disquieting medium. The pale, {{spectral}} images were unnerving to viewers in their silence.

40|$|The World Values Survey (WVS) {{question}} on trust {{has been widely}} used to study the economic effect of trust. Recent work, however, questions its validity as an accurate measure of trust by showing {{that it is not}} correlated with the sender’s behaviour in the Berg et al. trust game. What measure then should we trust to measure trust? In this article, we argue that the sender’s behaviour in a trust game is driven both by beliefs and by preferences. In contrast, WVS-like measures capture mostly the beliefbased component of a trust game. In the last 15 years, economists have increasingly paid attention to the role trust plays in economic activity. From economic growth (Knack and Keefer, 1997) to size of firms (La Porta et al., 1997; Bloom et al., 2009), from financial development (Guiso et al., 2004, 2008) to international trade and investments (Guiso et al., 2009), many economic phenomena have been related to the level of trust. But what is trust? And how do we measure it? ‘When we say we trust someone or that someone is <b>trustworthy</b> – <b>writes</b> Gambetta (2000) – we implicitly mean that the probability that he will perform an action that is beneficial (…) is high enough for us to consider in engaging in some form o...|$|R
40|$|Transformation of XML {{documents}} {{is often}} supported by special purpose languages that {{make use of}} pattern matching and replacement. Many XML programmers need to learn and understand one of these languages for transformation purposes. In this paper we contrast and compare special purpose, pattern matching solutions with transformation programs written in a general purpose, functional programming language. We use Scheme and the LAML libraries for XML transformations. Our approach is minimalistic {{in the sense that}} only a small vocabulary is needed to carry out the transformations. Overall, we have found that the Scheme/LAML solution is doing well in a direct comparison with other solutions. We have also found that the integrated validation of both the source and target documents makes it easier to <b>write</b> <b>trustworthy</b> transformations.

40|$|The {{force of}} oral transmission—its {{accuracy}} and integrity— {{is perhaps best}} demonstrated by comparing texts which have been transmitted in written form and orally transmitted texts, both sorts of transmission covering some fairly extensive period of time. One might expect that oral transmission would be far less effective, and that texts transmitted orally would contain many more errors, changes, deletions, accretions, {{and all manner of}} other divergences from the original form. Judah Goldin, however, describes the “baskets full of books, ” the “living texts ” represented by the living men who both orally transmitted and constituted, in their own persons, effective “oral publication ” of Hebrew sacred material. He adds that “to us it no doubt seems that an oral text would be less <b>trustworthy</b> than a <b>written</b> one. This was not necessarily the case with the ancients ” —and he cites the very plain passage in Plato’s Phaedrus which argues that writing, as opposed to oral transmission, tends to decrease rather than to increase understanding (Goldin 1955 : 24...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} two interrelated sections. The {{first section}} {{is a substantial}} piece of creative writing, which l have cailed 2 ̆ 7 Other People 2 ̆ 7 s Country: A Memoir, in the genre of travel memoir, and an essay. The memoir borrows techniques from fiction, drama and poetry {{to tell a story}} of a middle-aged, middle-class city nurse, who travels to a remote settlement {{at the edge of the}} Western Desert of Western Australia to provide health care for a fluctuating population of around 400 people, for whom English is a third or fourth language. Writing that includes stories about vulnerable people from another culture, whose lives have touched those of the writer, demands sensitivity to differences, as well as an ethical approach. Writing about Aboriginal people also demands an awareness of what is appropriate when writing about cultural material. To achieve the voice of a trustworthy narrator is a challenge that faces all writers of narrative non-fiction, including memoir. The truth is subjective; perception is unreliable; memory can be distorted; error slips in unwittingly; deliberate falsification is possible. In spite of all this, a writer of memoir makes a contract with the reader that the story is significant, and that it is the writer 2 ̆ 7 s truth, told as honestly as possible. The pivotal concern of this thesis is the question, 2 ̆ 7 What are some of the important considerations for a memoirist who is attempting to develop the voice of an ethical and <b>trustworthy</b> narrator <b>writing</b> about experiences encountered when living and working within an unfamiliar culture? The second part of the thesis is an essay which develops a theoretical framework in response to some of the major dilemmas I encountered in this undertaking. It embraces memory, aspects of Aboriginal vulnerability, and ethics through which to explore the concepts of truth and honesty in memoir-writing...|$|R
5000|$|Morrison was an unpretentious {{figure on}} the House floor. Weak-voiced (the shot through the lungs he {{sustained}} in the war never wholly lost its effect and his inveterate cigar smoking did not help much, either) and wholly lacking in personal magnetism, he was no orator and only a tolerable parliamentarian. A Washington correspondent likened him to [...] "a village lawyer. He has all the airs of one, and his ten years in Congress and as long {{a time in the}} Illinois Legislature, have failed to make anything else out of him as far as personal appearance goes. He is a brawny, country-looking man, and you can almost fancy that you see the hayseed in his hair. He is slouchy in his dress, his black broadcloth coat being, as a rule, anything but new in appearance, and anything but a compliment to the tailor who was its author and finisher. He delights in a soft black hat, a 'slouch,' not in the newest fashion either, though to a friend who was chaffing him on it the other day he remarked that he had a good silk one at home." [...] One onlooker complained that wherever he stood, even when he addressed the House, he kept his hands in his trouser pockets. [...] "He seems to be eternally suffering from cold," [...] he remarked. [...] "Or maybe he is looking for thoughts in his pockets instead of his head. He is the most restless man {{on the floor of the}} House. He never occupies his own seat. He is constantly moving about, dropping into this seat, then another, suggesting an incarnation of the principle of perpetual motion." [...] But members early came to find him careful, thoughtful, and a hard worker. They also declared him wholly <b>trustworthy,</b> and, <b>wrote</b> a former Illinois governor, [...] "oine of the most truthful and trustworthy men." [...] The radical Republican, Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, marked him as one of the best men on the opposition side, and, indeed, one of the best men of any party in a talented House."That man's word can be relied upon," [...] he is alleged to have said. A Republican, who had no sympathy with Morrison's tariff views, pronounced him an able, honest man. [...] "There is no trace of the demagogue about him," [...] he told a reporter. [...] "What he believes in he avows without hesitation. He is held in high esteem by the Republican side of the House." ...|$|R
500|$|However, the Expressionistic visual {{elements}} of the film are present {{not only in the}} main narrative, but also in the epilogue and prologue scenes of the frame story, which are supposed to be an objective account of reality. For example, the frame story scenes still have trees with tentacle-like branches and a high, foreboding wall in the background. Strange leaf and line patterns are seen on the bench Francis sits upon, flame-like geometric designs can be seen on the walls, and his asylum cell has the same distorted shape as in the main narrative. If the primary story were strictly the delusions of a madman, the frame story would be completely devoid of those elements, but the fact they are present makes it unclear whether that perspective can be taken as reliable either. Instead, the film offers no true normal world to oppose to that of the twisted and nightmarish world as described by Francis. As a result, after the film's closing scene, it can be seen as ambiguous whether Francis or the asylum director is truly the insane one, or whether both are insane. Likewise, the final shot of the film, with an iris that fades to a close-up on the asylum director's face, further creates doubt over whether the character is actually sane and <b>trustworthy.</b> As Brockmann <b>writes,</b> [...] "In the end, the film is not just about one unfortunate madman; it is about an entire world that is possibly out of balance". Mike Budd notes that, during the scene in which asylum doctors restrain Francis, his movements closely mimic those of Dr. Caligari from a similar scene during the main story. Budd says this suggests a [...] "dream logic of repetition" [...] that throws further confusion on which perspective is reality.|$|R
