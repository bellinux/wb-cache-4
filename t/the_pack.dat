5|$|The {{batteries}} in OR–7's Global Positioning System tracking unit expired in October 2015. Officials decided {{to replace the}} collar {{in order to keep}} track of <b>the</b> <b>pack,</b> which is protected under Oregon law and the federal Endangered Species Act. However, attempts to trap OR-7 or other members of <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> failed, and further tracking of OR-7 depended on trail cameras and live sightings. A trail camera in the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest captured an image of OR-7 and one of his offspring in early 2016. After four steers were killed by wolves in Wood River Valley in western Klamath County (immediately east of Jackson County) near where OR–7 was last seen, biologists said efforts to trap and re-collar the wolf would likely resume and that tracking could alert ranchers concerned about their livestock. On October 3, 2017, biologists caught and collared OR-54, another Rogue Pack wolf, thought to be OR-7's daughter, traveling with <b>the</b> <b>pack</b> in Wood River Valley. In lieu of another tracking device on OR-7, the collar on OR-54 will allow officials to track the movements and behaviors of <b>the</b> <b>pack.</b>|$|E

40|$|An {{application}} of statistic techniques for structure evaluation of packing of equal or distributed spherical particles is presented. <b>The</b> <b>packing</b> of particles generated by computer simulation is cut {{by a series}} of equally separated parallel planes, and the area densities of the cross-sections of particles on the cutting planes are used to analyse <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> structure. It is shown that as the number of the cutting planes increases, the mean of the area densities approaches <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> density. Then a time series analysis technique is applied to examine the randomness of <b>the</b> <b>packing.</b> <b>The</b> homogeneity of <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> is evaluated by testing the hypothesis that the particles are uniformly distributed within <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> space. <b>The</b> isotropy of <b>the</b> <b>packing</b> is evaluated both at micro-level, the distribution of projections of centre-to-centre lines between touching particles, and at macro-level, the variances of area densities on the cutting planes perpendicular to different directions.
