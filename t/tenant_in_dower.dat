40|$|The term 2 ̆ 2 {{partnership}} estates 2 ̆ 2 is used {{to designate}} a certain class of resulting trusts. These particular resulting trusts are classed with joint estates because, as a usual thing, the legal title is held by {{all the members of}} a partnership as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common, and in equity, the partners are considered as joint tenants for the purpose of administering the trust. But the legal title is not necessarily held by all the members as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common; for it may be vested in one of the partners as <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> severalty; in which case there is not only the resulting partnership trust, but an additional subordinate resulting trust to the partners as equitable <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common. The legal title may be in one or in several. As will be shown, the partners bear a two-fold relation to the beneficial interest in the property; for each has a separate and distinct lien on the property for any balance which may be found to be due him on an accounting; and as to this lien, his interest is purely potential: the balance on an accounting having been paid, the partners now own the residue of the beneficial interest as <b>tenants</b> <b>in</b> common...|$|R

5000|$|The {{concept of}} land tenure has been {{described}} as a [...] "spatial fragmentation of proprietary interests in land". No one person could claim absolute ownership of a parcel of land, except the Crown. Thus the modern concept of [...] "ownership" [...] is not helpful in explaining the complexity of the distribution of rights. In relation to a particular piece of land, a number of people had rights: first, the <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> demesne with possessory rights; second the mesne lord to whom the tenant owed services; third, a <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> chief to whom the mesne lord owed services; and finally the Crown who received services directly from the <b>tenant</b> <b>in</b> chief.|$|R
