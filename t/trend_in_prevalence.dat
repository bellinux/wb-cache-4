Although a positive family history is a highly predictive risk factor, its positive predictive value for the development of childhood asthma only ranges from 11 to 37 %. The marked increase in prevalence over a short time period suggests that multiple environmental risk factors are driving an upward <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>prevalence</b> that cannot be explained by genetic factors alone [7]. In utero or early life risk factors for asthma include maternal health and stress, mode of delivery, exposure to environmental pollutants and allergens, obesity, diet, and exposure to infections and antibiotics, among others.

Based on reports of high chloroquine (CQ) treatment fail-ure in Ghana and the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO) [1 - 3], CQ was replaced with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in 2004. Interestingly, high prevalence of CQ resistant mutants have been reported in different parts of the country by several researchers after the change in the malaria treat-ment policy [4, 5] though others have reported decreased <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>prevalence</b> and resistance in vitro [6, 7]. Substitution of adenylate with cytidylate at position 76 of Pfcrt gene which changes lysine to threonine (K 76 to T 76) is a single molecular marker that strongly correlates with CQ drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum in most malaria endemic areas [8, 9].

40|$|Trends in {{prevalence}} of cytological evidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical infection with human papilloma virus (HPV), {{as indicated by}} HPV infection and dyskeratosis, were studied in 2, 992 new attenders at a sexually transmitted diseases (STD) clinic between 1978 and 1982. Crude {{prevalence of}} CIN increased from 1. 3 % to 4. 3 % (P less than 0. 001) and crude prevalence of HPV infection increased from 2. 8 % to 9. 3 % (P less than 0. 001). Age adjustment {{had little effect on}} these trends. Review, in 1984 - 85, of samples of smears taken in 1978 and 1982 showed that recognition of koilocytosis by the laboratory had increased substantially over time while a tendency had developed to downgrade nuclear changes in the presence of koilocytosis. Correction of the 1978 and 1982 smear results to the 1984 - 85 classifications suggested that prevalence of koilocytosis had increased little (from 13. 4 % to 16. 1 %, P = 0. 20) while there had been a substantial real increase in CIN (0. 8 % to 2. 4 %, P less than 0. 001). To try to explain the trend in CIN, other characteristics of a sample of attenders at the STD clinic were studied. There were no appreciable trends in prevalence of past STD, number of sexual partners in the last 3 months, method of contraception, genital warts and culture of N. gonorrhoea, T. vaginalis, C. albicans and Chlamydia sp. from the vagina.

40|$|Non-response {{introduces}} {{uncertainty in}} the results of most epidemiological surveys and it can bias the final estimates of prevalence. In the present paper a new method is proposed {{to deal with the}} non-response problem, when the survey is performed through subsequent stages, taking non-responders at one stage as target population for the next stage. While the existing methods are based on the a priori assumption of a specific prevalence trend across following stages, the new approach starts by analysing the non-response generating process and by choosing the model which best fits to the data available from responders. Using the maximum likelihood three hierarchic models are tested: 1) the no-bias model; 2) the two parameter model, which assumes two prevalence values, one for responders to the first stage and one {{for the rest of the}} sample; 3) the regression model, which hypothesizes a monotonous <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>prevalence</b> across stages.

Methods The estimated trends in age-standardized prevalence and the YLDs rate due to VL in 22 EMR countries were {{extracted from the}} Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2015 study. The association of Socio-demographic Index (SDI) with changes in prevalence and YLDs of VL was evaluated using a multilevel mixed model. Results The age-standardized prevalence of VL in the EMR was 18. 2 % in 1990 and 15. 5 % in 2015. The total age-standardized YLDs rate attributed to all-cause VL in EMR was 536. 9 per 100, 000 population in 1990 and 482. 3 per 100, 000 population in 2015. For each 0. 1 unit increase in SDI, the age-standardized prevalence and YLDs rate of VL showed a reduction of 1. 5 % (p < 0. 001) and 23. 9 per 100, 000 population (p < 0. 001), respectively.

The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the baseline prevalence of genital infections and of a disturbed vaginal ecologic system and their relationship to urbanization. STUDY DESIGN: More than 190, 000 cervical smears were screened by 1 cytology laboratory in the context of the Dutch national screening programs. The women who were symptom free and had been registered in the statutory files of municipal units were screened by invitation. Urbanization (place of residence) was derived from the postal code. To investigate a <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>prevalence</b> in relation to urbanization, Schaafsma's method was used. RESULTS: Bacterial vaginosis had the highest score per 1000 screened women (36. 1), followed by Candida (12. 6). Higher prevalence of human papillomavirus, bacterial vaginosis, and Trichomonas was related to urbanization as was, whereas Candida was not. CONCLUSION: Human papillomavirus and Trichomonas are more frequently found in women who live in the large cities, which in The Netherlands also harbor the high-risk population for premalignant cytologic evidence.

Despite {{difficulties}} in obtaining methodologically consistent data for the region, we analyzed the results from prevalence surveys in 14 Latin American countries. Smoking prevalence among men varied from 24. 1 % (Paraguay) to 66. 3 % (Dominican Republic) and among women from 5. 5 % (Paraguay) to 26, 6 % (Uruguay). By applying point prevalence data to the stage model of the tobacco epidemic in developed countries, we concluded that the Latin American countries are in stage 2, i. e., with a clearly rising prevalence among men, a prevalence for women that is beginning to increase, and mortality attributable to smoking among men still not reflecting peak prevalence. None of the countries analyzed appeared to have reached stage 3, in which one observes a downward <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>prevalence</b> of smoking among men and peak prevalence among women, with broad impact on tobacco-related mortality.

Family history reporting has also been found to be more accurate among first-degree relatives than second-degree or more-distant relatives (Eerola et al. 2000, Ivanovich et al. 2002, Mai et al. 2011). Data are sparse on accuracy of reporting of family history in different racial/ethnic or immigrant populations. Orom et al. noted that reporting is less accurate in immigrant groups and that non-white immigrants are less likely to report a family history of cancer than their white counterparts (Orom et al. 2008).
