5|$|Born William fitzHerbert in York, William {{was the son}} of Herbert of Winchester, or Herbert fitzAlberic, {{chancellor}} and {{treasurer of}} King Henry I. Most sources say his mother was Emma, half-sister of King Stephen and Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> illegitimate daughter of Stephen II, Count of Blois, Stephen's father. New research, however, suggests that Emma might have been a daughter of Hunger fitzOdin, who held lands in Dorset in the Domesday survey. William was born sometime before the 1090s, but the exact date of birth is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Following the Games, she {{received}} death threats upon returning to Somalia, and after being confronted by Al-Shabaab, {{she began to}} deny <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> athlete. The organisation banned woman from participating in sports, and Omar eventually {{made her way to}} Ethiopia in order to pursue the hope of competing in the 2012 Summer Olympics. She attempted to make her way to Europe, travelling to Libya in September 2011. Alongside other refugees, she attempted to cross the Mediterranean by sea in 2012; she drowned while attempting to board an Italian naval vessel when the boat she was on was intercepted off the coast of Libya. Omar's life story was later dramatised as the graphic novel An Olympic Dream: The story of Samia Yusuf Omar by German artist Reinhard Kleist.|$|E
5|$|Ruggiero di Lauria {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Regio Cantiere di Castellammare di Stabia {{shipyard}} on 3 August 1881 and launched on 9 August 1884. She was not completed for another {{three and a half}} years, her construction finally being finished on 1 February 1888. Because of the rapid pace of naval technological development in the late 19th century, her lengthy construction period meant <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> obsolete design by the time she entered service. The year after she entered service, the British began building the , the first pre-dreadnought battleships, which marked a significant step forward in capital ship design. In addition, technological progress, particularly in armor production techniquesfirst Harvey armor and then Krupp armorrapidly rendered older vessels like Ruggiero di Lauria obsolete.|$|E

50|$|There is {{no direct}} {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> daughter of Gediminas, {{but because of}} her high-profile marriage, most historians have concluded <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> member of Gediminas' family. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> born probably between 1316 and 1321.|$|R
5|$|She {{was twelve}} {{at the time}} of the February Revolution of 1917, during which she favored Alexander Kerensky over Tsar Nicholas II. The {{subsequent}} October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed. Her father's business was confiscated, and the family fled to the Crimean Peninsula, which was initially under control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War. While in high school, Rand confirmed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> atheist and valued reason above any other human virtue. After graduating from high school in the Crimea in June 1921, Rand returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time), where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion nearly starving.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{evacuation}} of its citizens on 13 January, the US government stated that it recognised that Zanzibar lay within Britain's sphere of influence, and would not intervene. The US did, however, urge that Britain cooperate with other Southeast African countries to restore order. The first British military vessel on the scene was the survey ship HMS Owen, which was diverted from the Kenyan coast and arrived {{on the evening of}} 12January. Owen was joined on 15January by the frigate Rhyl and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Hebe. While the lightly armed Owen had been able to provide the revolutionaries with an unobtrusive reminder of Britain's military power, the Hebe and Rhyl were different matters. Due to inaccurate reports that the situation in Zanzibar was deteriorating, the Rhyl was carrying a company of troops of the first battalion of the Staffordshire Regiment from Kenya, the embarkation of which was widely reported in the Kenyan media, and would hinder British negotiations with Zanzibar. The Hebe had just finished removing stores from the naval depot at Mombasa and was loaded with weapons and explosives. Although the Revolutionary Council was unaware of the nature of Hebes cargo, the Royal Navy's refusal to allow a search of the ship created suspicion ashore and rumours circulated <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> amphibious assault ship.|$|E
5|$|Rotblat {{returned}} to Britain to become senior lecturer and {{acting director of}} research in nuclear physics at the University of Liverpool. Most of his family had survived the war. With {{the help of a}} Polish man, his brother-in-law Mieczysław (Mietek) Pokorny had created false Polish Catholic identities for Rotblat's sister Ewa and niece Halina. Ewa, taking advantage of the fact <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> ash blonde who, like Rotblat, spoke fluent Polish as well as Yiddish, smuggled {{the rest of the family}} out of the Warsaw Ghetto. Mietek, Rotblat's brother Mordecai (Michael) and Michael's wife Manya, Rotblat's mother Scheindel, and two Russian soldiers lived in a concealed bunker underneath a house near Otwock, in which Ewa and Halina lived with a Polish family. Displays of Polish anti-Semitism that she witnessed during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising embittered Ewa towards Poland, and she petitioned Rotblat to help the family emigrate to England. He therefore now accepted Chadwick's offer of British citizenship so he could help them escape from Poland. They lived with him in London for some time before becoming established. Halina would go on to graduate from Somerville College, Oxford and University College London, and become an editor of the Dictionary of National Biography.|$|E

5|$|The {{power of}} the Aksumite Kingdom {{declined}} after the 6th century due {{to the rise of}} other regional states in the Horn of Africa. Modern scholars continue to debate the identity and provenance of the legendary or semi-legendary figure Gudit (fl. 10th century), a queen who is traditionally believed to have overthrown the Kingdom of Aksum. The legend is found in the 13th-century chronicle of the monk Tekle Haymanot, who compiled historical writings gathered from various Ethiopian churches and monasteries. The chronicle alleges that, after being exiled from Axum, she married a Jewish king of Syria and converted to Judaism. The Scottish travel writer James Bruce (1730–1794) was incredulous about the tale and believed she was simply a Jewish queen. Carlo Conti Rossini (1872–1949) hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> ethnic Sidamo from Damot, whereas Steven Kaplan argues she was a non-Christian invader and historian Knud Tage Andersen contends she was a regular member of the Aksumite royal house who shrewdly seized the throne. The latter is more in line with another legend that claims Dil Na'od, the last king of Aksum, kept his daughter Mesobe Werq in isolation out of fear of a prophecy that her son would overthrow him, yet she eloped with the nobleman Mara Takla Haymanot from Lasta who eventually killed the Aksumite king in a duel, took the throne and founded the Zagwe dynasty. The latter {{remains one of the most}} poorly understood periods of Ethiopia's recorded history. What is known is that the early Zagwe kings were polytheistic, eventually converted to Christianity, and ruled over the northern Highlands of Ethiopia, while Islamic sultanates inhabited the coastal Ethiopian Lowlands.|$|E
25|$|In later years, Botkin {{became a}} lifelong {{advocate}} of Anna Anderson, {{who claimed to}} be the surviving Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. DNA results later proved <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> impostor called Franziska Schanzkowska.|$|E
25|$|Cott {{was then}} cross-examined by David Thompson, who {{asked about her}} {{personal}} feelings on same-sex marriage to establish <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> advocate rather than a dispassionate scholar.

25|$|Harvard scholar Karen King {{writes that}} more of the many women who contributed to the {{formation}} of Christianity in its earliest years are becoming known. Further, she concludes that for centuries in Western Christianity, Mary Magdalene has been wrongly identified as the adulteress and repentant prostitute presented in —a connection supposed by tradition but nowhere claimed in the New Testament. According to King, the Gospel of Mary shows <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> influential figure, a prominent disciple and leader of one wing of the early Christian movement that promoted women's leadership.|$|E

She teams up with Yuri (Ryang's psycho-ex) to plot to take down Fanta and Ryang, though she comments to Yuri at one point that she somewhat likes Fanta, but has to do what her 'mastuh' wants done. Her 'mastuh' is in fact Lady Oran/Oreadia.|$|E
25|$|Her rites allowed {{women the}} use of strong wine and blood-sacrifice, things {{otherwise}} forbidden them by Roman tradition. Men were barred from her mysteries and the possession of her true name. Given that male authors had limited knowledge of her rites and attributes, ancient speculations about her identity abound, among them <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> aspect of Terra, Ops, Cybele, or Ceres, or a Latin form of the Greek goddess Damia. Most often, she was identified as the wife, sister, or daughter of the god Faunus, thus an equivalent or aspect of the nature-goddess Fauna, who could prophesy the fates of women.|$|E
25|$|DIMIA {{officers}} first interviewed Solon on 3 May 2001. According to the Comrie report, {{the officers}} presumed that Solon was an illegal immigrant, {{and did not}} do proper background checks. On 12 July, Solon was transferred from the hospital to DIMIA custody, and taken to a motel in Brisbane. She told the officials <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> Australian citizen, {{and did not want}} to leave the country, however she was ignored. On 17 July, Queensland Police officially listed Solon as a missing person, several months after she had failed to collect her son from childcare. However, this information was not picked up by DIMIA.|$|E

25|$|Sometime between 836 and 839, Alexios {{was engaged}} to the princess Maria, Emperor Theophilos's {{youngest}} and favourite daughter, despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> infant. Theophilos had no male heir at the time, and this move was evidently intended as marking out Alexios as his heir apparent. He was progressively promoted to patrikios and anthypatos, then to magistros and eventually to Caesar. He {{was the only person}} known to have been promoted to the rank during Theophilos's reign, and may indeed have been raised to it as early as 831, when the presence of an unnamed Caesar is attested at an imperial triumph. Alternatively, it may be a reference to another, otherwise unknown, holder of the title, who probably died shortly after.|$|E
25|$|Nanoha and Fate {{repeatedly}} {{face off}} over each new Jewel Seed they find, and the TSAB soon interferes {{to prevent the}} collateral damage caused by their battles. Nanoha eventually manages to overpower Fate and brings her to the TSAB, prompting Precia to abandon her and attempt a dimensional jump to Al Hazard {{with the power of}} the few Jewel Seeds that Fate has managed to gather. Gathering her resolve, Fate decides to aid the TSAB and Nanoha in their fight to stop Precia. Although they minimize the destructive side-effects of using the Jewel Seeds, they fail to prevent Precia from finishing the spell, and her final whereabouts remains unknown. Fate and Nanoha decide to become friends, but Fate must first travel to the TSAB homeworld to prove <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> unwilling accessory in Precia's crimes.|$|E
25|$|In August 1998 {{taxi driver}} John Shaw, from Hyde, {{contacted}} the police, informing {{them that he}} suspected Shipman of murdering 21 of his patients. Grundy's daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when solicitor Brian Burgess informed her that a will had been made, apparently by her mother. There were doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded her and her children, but left £386,000 to Shipman. Burgess told Woodruff to report it, {{and she went to}} the police, who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed, and when examined was found to contain traces of diamorphine, often used for pain control in terminal cancer patients. Shipman claimed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> addict and showed them comments in his compuerised medical journal, but a program on his computer showed they were written after her death. Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998, and was found to own a typewriter of the kind used to make the forged will.|$|E
