40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to review <b>the</b> neural <b>adaptations</b> that occur in able-bodied humans with {{alterations}} in chronic patterns of physical activity. <b>The</b> <b>adaptations</b> are categorized as those related to cortical maps, motor command, descending drive, muscle activation, motor units, and sensory feedback. We focused on <b>the</b> <b>adaptations</b> that occur with such activities as strength training, limb immobilization, and limb unloading. For these types of interventions, <b>the</b> <b>adaptations</b> are widely distributed throughout the nervous system, but those changes that are observed with strength training are often not the converse of those found with reduced-use protocols.

40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} three modern screen <b>adaptations</b> of <b>The</b> Pardoner’s Tale as written by Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1343 - 1400) by {{focusing}} on three central questions, the selection {{of which may be}} justified by placing <b>the</b> <b>adaptations</b> within their historical, cultural and literary context: (i) how do <b>the</b> three chosen <b>adaptations</b> deal with <b>the</b> concept of “the immortal old man”, (ii) how do they deal with the cultural and religious references, as well as the allusions that are present in Geoffrey Chaucer’s tale, (iii) how do <b>the</b> <b>adaptations</b> deal with <b>the</b> pardoner himself? The conclusion will be as follows: <b>the</b> <b>adaptations</b> may be taken as evidence that certain changes with regards to religion and society, and the perception of these two elements, have taken place...|$|R

30|$|When {{this initial}} {{analysis}} did not yield meaningful results {{that we could}} relate to <b>the</b> <b>adaptations</b> we had made, we began to test ideas we saw emerging by iteratively reviewing the themes and evidence for them. We focused on themes related {{to the development of}} and changes to video-based discussions (VBD) in this round of analysis. This iterative process continued until we had checked and re-checked each line of evidence against the emergent themes and found that all the evidence had a thematic home. We realized that the nature of these adaptations was more related to district “givens” and the limited experiences TLs had in a variety of categories. As a consequence of seeing these patterns, we reorganized our data based on emergent themes that had more explanatory power regarding <b>the</b> <b>adaptations</b> that we made to the models. We then analyzed the two categories of changes to the models and the related decisions to identify patterns in <b>the</b> <b>adaptations</b> and reasons for <b>the</b> <b>adaptations.</b>|$|R
