5|$|Doby {{had participated}} in {{baseball}} clinics in 1962 {{as a member of}} a travel delegation from the U.S. Department of State. That year, Doby came out of retirement and became one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Americans</b> to play professional baseball in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball league when he and Don Newcombe, a former teammate with the Newark Eagles, signed contracts with the Chunichi Dragons. After the season, Doby returned to the U.S. in October and resumed his work as a liquor retailer.|$|E
5|$|Hatfield {{joined the}} U.S. Navy after graduation, {{taking part in}} the World War II battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa as a landing craft officer where he {{witnessed}} the carnage of the war. A lieutenant, he also witnessed the effects of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Americans</b> to see the ruins of the city (later, as Senator, Hatfield opposed arms proliferation and the Vietnam War). After Japan, he served in French Indochina, where he witnessed firsthand the wealth divide between the peasant Vietnamese and the colonial French bourgeoisie. After his discharge, he spent one year at Willamette’s law school, but decided politics or teaching better suited him.|$|E
5|$|Misperceptions of the Dixie Mission {{contributed to}} the {{nationwide}} Red Scare in the 1950s and 1960s. Thawing relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States in the 1970s opened a new chapter for the mission. For the first time, the mission and its participants {{became the subject of}} serious scholarship, and many of the mission participants were among <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Americans</b> invited to visit China in twenty years. In China, the Dixie Mission is remembered as a positive time between the two nations, and a symbol of Sino-American cooperation.|$|E

5|$|The Dixie Mission {{hosted the}} Patrick Hurley and George Marshall {{diplomatic}} missions {{to negotiate a}} unification of the Chinese Communists and Nationalists. Both diplomatic efforts failed. Later, the brief existence of the Dixie Mission served as a positive memory between the People's Republic of China and the United States during the administration of President Richard M. Nixon when official {{relations between the two}} countries were re-established. Veterans of the Dixie Mission, like John Service and Koji Ariyoshi, were among <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Americans</b> invited to visit the People's Republic of China.|$|E
5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of North America migrated from Siberia {{by way of}} the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though increasing evidence suggests an even earlier arrival. After crossing the land bridge, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Americans</b> moved southward, either along the Pacific coast or through an interior ice-free corridor between the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets. The Clovis culture appeared around 11,000 BC, and it is considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the Americas. While the Clovis culture was thought, throughout the late 20th century, to represent the first human settlement of the Americas, in recent years consensus has changed in recognition of pre-Clovis cultures.|$|E

25|$|Riis and his photographers {{were among}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Americans</b> to use flash photography. Pistol lamps were {{dangerous}} and looked threatening, and {{would soon be}} replaced by another method for which Riis lit magnesium powder on a frying pan. The process involved removing the lens cap, igniting the flash powder and replacing the lens cap; the time taken to ignite the flash powder sometimes allowed a visible image blurring created by the flash.|$|E
50|$|Pépin, born {{in what is}} now New York State, was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>American</b> to own {{and operate}} a circus in his native country. The {{theatrical}} company of Pépin and Breschard thus can be considered <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>American</b> circus.|$|R

25|$|Based on very meager information, Thomas Jefferson Wertenbaker {{suggests}} in <b>The</b> <b>First</b> <b>Americans</b> that Copernican astronomy, {{although not}} taught formally until later, started to emerge at Harvard College in 1670. In 1671 a physics class refused {{to read an}} assigned text that supported the Ptolemaic system. However, as early as 1659, one Harvard graduate, Zachariah Brigden, began to promote the new astronomy in the New England almanacs. Most astrological information came to the people by way of these almanacs.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Steinbeck {{made the}} first of many trips to the Soviet Union, this one with {{photographer}} Robert Capa. They visited Moscow, Kiev, Tbilisi, Batumi and Stalingrad, some of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Americans</b> to visit many parts of the USSR since the communist revolution. Steinbeck's 1948 book about their experiences, A Russian Journal, was illustrated with Capa's photos. In 1948, the year the book was published, Steinbeck was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.|$|E
25|$|Seldes {{claimed that}} the Battle of Saint-Mihiel never happened. In his account, General Pershing planned to capture the city, but on September 1 the Germans decided to remove their forces from Saint-Mihiel to {{reinforce}} other positions. Seldes claimed no shots were fired as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Americans,</b> he among them, entered the city on September 13 to be greeted as liberators before General Pershing, Pétain, and other high-ranking officers arrived. The thousands of German prisoners captured, he wrote, were taken as they mistakenly arrived {{at the train station}} days later to relieve the German troops that had left days earlier.|$|E

Alan Shepard was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>American</b> in space and later {{became one of the}} twelve people to walk on the Moon. John Glenn was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>American</b> to orbit <b>the</b> Earth and after his induction went on, in 1998, to become the oldest man to fly in space, aged 77. Gus Grissom was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>American</b> to fly in space twice and was the commander of the ill-fated Apollo 1, which resulted in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> astronaut deaths directly related to preparation for spaceflight.|$|R
50|$|Eugene Schuyler (Ithaca, New York, February 26, 1840 - Venice, Italy, July 16, 1890) was {{a nineteenth-century}} American scholar, writer, {{explorer}} and diplomat.

25|$|The Valdivia {{culture is}} the first culture where {{significant}} remains have been discovered. Their civilization dates back as early as 3500 BC. Living in the area near The Valdivias were <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Americans</b> to use pottery. They created bowls, jars and female statues out of clay, both for everyday life and for use in religious ceremonies. They navigated the seas on rafts with sails and established a trade network with tribes in the Andes and the Amazon. Valdivia art and artifacts have been found throughout the country. An extensive collection is {{on display at the}} Museo Fianco Banco Central in Quito and the UEES in Guayaquil.|$|E
25|$|The company, {{as it had}} planned, {{introduced}} the new formula with big marketing pushes in New York (workers renovating the Statue of Liberty were symbolically <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>Americans</b> given cans to take home) and Washington, D.C. (where thousands of free cans were given away in Lafayette Park). As soon as New Coke was introduced, the new formula was available at drink fountains in the United States {{as well as at}} McDonald's as Coca-Cola pushed this drink to market in many places. Sales figures from those cities, and other regions where it had been introduced, showed a reaction that went as the market research had predicted. In fact, Coke's sales were up 8% over the same period as the year before.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>Americans</b> {{arrived in}} Vienna {{in the end}} of July 1945, when the Soviets were {{pressing}} Renner to surrender Austrian oil fields. Americans objected and blocked the deal but ultimately the Soviets assumed control over Austrian oil in their zone. The British arrived only in September. The Allied Council of four military governors convened for its first meeting in Vienna on 12 September 1945. It refused to recognize Renner's claim of a national government but did not prevent him from extending influence into the Western zones. Renner appointed vocal anti-communist Karl Gruber as Foreign Minister and tried to reduce Communist influence. On 20 October 1945, Renner's reformed cabinet was recognized by the Western allies and received a go-ahead for the first legislative election.|$|E
