5|$|Although all of Kant's work {{develops}} his ethical theory, it is {{most clearly}} defined in Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Critique of Practical Reason and Metaphysics of Morals. As part of the Enlightenment tradition, Kant based his ethical theory {{on the belief that}} reason should be used <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> people ought to act. He did not attempt to prescribe specific action, but instructed that reason should be used <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> to behave.|$|E

5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll have been used <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and mainmast had two and three square sails respectively; the mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure mizzen {{had at least one}} lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the bowsprit flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the spars from which the sails were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E
5|$|At {{least three}} aspects of flowers {{appear to have}} coevolved between {{flowering}} plants and insects, because they involve communication between these organisms. Firstly, flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> far away a flower is, to approach it, and to identify where to land and finally to feed. Secondly, flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen, and colours such as blue and ultraviolet, to which their eyes are sensitive; in contrast, bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange. Thirdly, flowers such as some orchids mimic females of particular insects, deceiving males into pseudocopulation.|$|E

5|$|Following post-storm surveys, it was {{determined}} that most of the severely damaged schools were built improperly and the upper-floors were not designed to bear typhoon-force winds. According to building codes in Thailand, structures are mandated to be able to withstand up to 120kgf/m2 of pressure from winds. In the years following the typhoon, studies by engineers were conducted in the hardest hit regions <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> to best rebuild structures in the country. With many of the destroyed structures being constructed from wood, reinforced concrete structures were the suggested replacement. The new buildings could last up to 50 years with proper construction; however, sub-standard building would result in a need for repairs within five years.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{destruction}} of the original World Trade Center, there was debate regarding the future of the World Trade Center site. There were proposals for its reconstruction almost immediately, and by 2002, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation had organized a competition <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>how</b> to use the site. The proposals were part of a larger plan to memorialize the September 11 attacks and rebuild the complex. When the public rejected the first round of designs, a second, more open competition took place in December 2002, in which a design by Daniel Libeskind was selected as the winner. This design underwent many revisions, mainly because of disagreements with developer Larry Silverstein, who held the lease to the World Trade Center site at that time.|$|E
