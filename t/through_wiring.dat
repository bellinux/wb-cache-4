50|$|Analysis of {{telemetry}} data {{confirmed that}} the Atlas had malfunctioned due to hot exhaust gases being recirculated into the thrust section, which burned <b>through</b> <b>wiring</b> and caused loss of thrust, combined with high vibration levels. The pneumatic system also malfunctioned as tank pressure never properly transitioned to in-flight levels and along with propellant flow and pressure steadily decreased during ascent. The flight was considered a partial success because the missile had otherwise performed well. In particular, the Atlas's inflated balloon structure, which engineers doubted would even fly at all, had held together as the missile tumbled. The flight control system also worked well as it {{tried in vain to}} correct the missile's flight path.|$|E

However the cost of such a small order of locomotives was excessively high so the decision was taken to use pairs of refurbished Class 37/5 locomotives instead. Twelve were selected and refurbished for their new duties, and renumbered as the 37/6 class. The refurbishment included a full overhaul, re-gearing to allow 80 mph running, fitting with multiple working capabilities, and <b>through</b> <b>wiring</b> for electric train supply, (ETS) used for powering services in the coaches such as air conditioning.

50|$|On January 16, 1959, Missile 13B, {{which was}} the backup booster for SCORE and carried the same {{modified}} hardware, was launched from LC-14 but lost thrust slightly under a minute into launch and fell into the Atlantic Ocean. The exact cause of the failure could not be determined because just like 10B, the missile was not carrying a telemetry package due to the intended mission of flying an Atlas to its maximum range, which required stripping the missile down to as light a weight as possible. Starting at T+100 seconds, the engines began gimbaling in all three axes, resulting in complete loss of control and missile tumbling. Propulsion system performance started decaying at T+109 seconds and the engines completely shut down at T+121 seconds. The missile remained structurally intact until impact with the ocean. The failure was {{believed to have been}} caused by exhaust gases being sucked into the thrust section and burning <b>through</b> <b>wiring.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A {{few seconds}} into launch, a {{transient}} voltage caused the KORD {{to shut down}} Engine #12. After this happened, the KORD shut off Engine #24 to maintain symmetrical thrust. At T+6 seconds, pogo oscillation in the #2 engine tore several components off their mounts and started a propellant leak. At T+25 seconds, further vibrations ruptured a fuel line and caused RP-1 to spill into the aft section of the booster. When it {{came into contact with}} the leaking gas, a fire started. The fire then burned <b>through</b> <b>wiring</b> in the power supply, causing electrical arcing which was picked up by sensors and interpreted by the KORD as a pressurization problem in the turbopumps. The KORD responded by issuing a general command to shut down the entire first stage at T+68 seconds into launch. This signal was also transmitted up to the second and third stages, [...] "locking" [...] them and preventing a manual ground command from being sent to start their engines. Telemetry also showed that the power generators in the N-1 continued functioning until impact with the ground at T+183 seconds. Investigators discovered the remains of the rocket 32 miles (52 kilometers) from the launch pad. Vasily Mishin had initially blamed the generators for the failure, as he could not think of any other reason why all 30 engines would shut down at once, but this was quickly disproven by telemetry data and the recovery of the generators from the crash site. They had survived in good condition and were shipped back to the Istra plant, where they were refurbished and worked without any problems under bench testing. The investigative team did not speculate as to whether the burning first stage could have continued flying if the KORD system had not shut it down. The KORD was found to have a number of serious design flaws and poorly programmed logic. One unforeseen flaw was that its operating frequency, 1000Hz, happened to perfectly coincide with vibration generated by the propulsion system, and the shutdown of Engine #12 at liftoff was believed to have been caused by pyrotechnic devices opening a valve, which produced a high frequency oscillation that went into adjacent wiring and was assumed by the KORD to be an overspeed condition in the engine's turbopump. The wiring in Engine #12 was believed to be particularly vulnerable to this effect due to its length, however other engines had similar wiring and were unaffected. Also, the system ended up drawing 25V instead of its designed 15V due to the ruptured power lines. The control wiring was relocated and coated with asbestos for fireproofing and the operating frequency changed. [...] The launch escape system was activated and did its job properly, saving the mockup of the spacecraft. All subsequent flights had freon fire extinguishers installed next to every engine. According to Sergei Afanasiev, the logic of the command to shut down the entire cluster of 30 engines in Block A was incorrect in that instance, as the subsequent investigation revealed.|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} {{a signal}} current waveform {{by using a}} high-T c superconductor (HTS) sampler with a 1 -ps delay between every sampling point. The maximum time differential obtained in the measured waveform was 12 m mm mA/ps with 2. 5 -m mm mA current sensitivity at 25 K. This result guarantees that the sampler is able to measure current waveforms correctly when their maximum time differential is less than 12 m mm mA/ps. The superior time resolution was achieved by using high-speed single-fluxquantum pulses generated in the HTS circuit. A unique feature of the sampler is that it directly measures the current with picosecond time-resolution and microampere current- resolution.

40|$|Inductive {{charging}} {{of electronic}} devices is a newer {{technology that is}} capable of transferring electrical power without physical contact <b>through</b> <b>wiring.</b> Research is currently being done to find and improve ways to implement this technology on electric cars. If this type of technology pas implemented on a large scale throughout much of the country, electrical or hybrid cars could travel across counties and states without depleting their batteries. The current problem with electric cars is that they have a limited range of travel. Even with larger batteries with much more capacitance, the range of pure electric cars usually does not exceed 100 miles (Gigaom, 2012). This is acceptable for a daily commute, but it does not hold up for cross country travel. It would be completely infeasible to travel long distances while having to stop to let your car charge for several hours. A charging system in the road way is likely the only way to rid electric cars of this impending limitation. The main goal of this research was to design and build a suitable concrete box that can contain the necessary charging equipment, be placed underneath the road surface and maintain its structural integrity to protect the electronic equipment from crushing and moisture. Being placed a few inches below the road surface, the concrete box would {{need to be able to}} support the same loading that the roadway was designed for. The concrete box would need to uphold large compressive load while remaining durable. It should also be sturdy enough to avoid tensile cracks that could arise from handling during installation. Overall, the concrete box’s design must be easily fabricated on a mass scale, light enough for ease of installation, and tough enough to maintain structural integrity over years of cyclic loading...|$|E

40|$|IntroductionFailed {{antegrade}} endovascular recanalization of occluded mesenteric arteries {{has traditionally}} been dealt with by open mesenteric bypass or by hybrid solutions. This article describes a totally endovascular retrograde approach for recanalization of occluded mesenteric arteries through the pancreaticoduodenal arcade. Surgical techniqueA femoral or brachial approach is used {{to gain access to}} the patent visceral artery. A micro-catheter is advanced in a retrograde fashion into the distal main stem of the occluded artery through the gastroduodenal artery and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arcade. A combination of. 014 ″ and. 018 ″ wires is used to cross the occlusion in a retrograde fashion and to land into the aortic lumen. The guide wire is then snared through the brachial access, establishing a <b>through</b> and <b>through</b> <b>wire.</b> A micro-catheter is then advanced on the <b>through</b> and <b>through</b> <b>wire</b> across the occlusion from the brachial access. The distal occluded artery is then catheterized by advancing a second wire parallel to the <b>through</b> and <b>through</b> <b>wire.</b> The remaining procedure is performed as a standard antegrade approach. DiscussionThe totally endovascular retrograde approach through collaterals can be helpful for the recanalization of mesenteric artery occlusions. This technically complex procedure should be reserved for cases in which the traditional antegrade approach has failed...|$|R
40|$|As {{with most}} {{elements}} of infrastructure, electrical wiring is innocuous; usually hidden away and unnoticed until it fails. Failure of infrastructure, however, sometimes leads to serious {{health and safety}} hazards. Electrical wiring fails when the polymeric (usually rubber) insulation material that sheathes the conductor gets embrittled with age from exposure to pressure, temperature or radiation cycling or when the insulation gets removed by the chafing of wires against each other. Miles of such wiring {{can be found in}} typical aircraft, with significant lengths of the wiring immersed in aviation fuel - a recipe for an explosion if a spark were to occur. Diagnosing the health of wiring is thus an important aspect of monitoring the health of aging aircraft. Stress wave propagation <b>through</b> <b>wiring</b> affords a quick and non-invasive method for health monitoring. The extent to which a stress wave propagating through the cable core gets attenuated depends on the condition of the surrounding insulation. When the insulation is in good condition - supple and pliable, there is more damping or attenuation of the waveform. As the insulation gets embrittled and cracked, the attenuation is likely to reduce and the waveform of the propagating stress wave is likely to change. The monitoring of these changes provides a potential tool to evaluate wiring or cabling in service that is not accessible for visual inspection. This experiment has been designed for use in an introductory mechanical or materials engineering instrumentation lab. Initial setup (after procuring all the materials) should take the lab instructor about 4 hours. A single measurement can be initiated and saved to disk in less than 3 minutes, allowing for all the students in a typical lab section to take their own data rather than share a single set of data for the entire class...|$|E
40|$|Too much citrus draws in roof rats Charlotte Barnes {{lets out}} a happy “whoop! ” as she {{hangs up the phone}} with a smile. “She got the check!” Barnes exclaims, beaming from ear to ear as she high-fives ABC 15 {{reporter}} Joe Ducey. Barnes, a retired O. R. nurse from Kentucky, is one of less than a dozen volunteers who helps Ducey with his “Let Joe Know ” consumer affairs program, which airs at 6 p. m. weekdays on ABC-Channel 15. The volunteers return phone calls and e-mails and try to offer advice or referrals to those that won’t make the on-air program. It could be a landlord/tenant issue, a bad contractor problem, or someone who is about to fall for a scam and needs guidance. Barnes explains that a 96 -year-old woman was transported from a physical therapy center back to her home via ambulance in October 2014 and was given a bill by the ambulance company for $ 1, 000. She paid it, without giving a thought to {{the fact that she had}} both Medicare and private insurance. A neighbor lady who checks in on the elderly woman regularly found out about the bill and after calling the ambulance company to get it straightened out—without any luck—she left a message with “Let Joe Know. ” It was Barnes who first contacted the neighbor, and then called the ambulance company, who said The overabundance of citrus this winter and spring may seem like a happy circumstance for those who enjoy spending hours squeezing oranges and grapefruits, or making tasty desserts with lemons and limes. But for some North Central residents, the windfall of citrus marks the return of an old nemesis: the roof rat. Roof rats were first discovered in the Arcadia neighborhood in 2002. Not native to Arizona, the rats are believed to have been transported to Maricopa County from one of Arizona’s neighboring coastal states. They soon spread to different areas of the Valley, including North Central Phoenix.

40|$|The Pet Foods Manufacturers’ Association (2003) {{estimates}} 50 % of UK {{households have}} a pet. Whilst most have traditional ‘domestic’ species, {{there is an}} increasing trend for exotic species including invertebrates, snakes, parrots and raptors. Insufficient knowledge of species’ needs may result in poor animal welfare. Health and safety issues potentially compromise human welfare, such as zoonotic disease or bite injury. Escaped small mammals can chew <b>through</b> <b>wiring,</b> causing a fire hazard to all residents. These issues have become of increasing concern to the community, as reflected in legislation, and to Housing Providers. PATHWAY (the Pets and Housing Working Group) initially attempted to address these concerns with the publicaton of two advisory documents, “Guidelines for Housing Providers” and “Pets and People”. The survey aimed to {{provide an overview of}} the current state of housing provision for pet owners and the nature and content of ‘pet’ policies. A questionnaire was sent to 1193 Local Authorities and Housing Associations. 374 usable returns were received, 211 supplied policy documentation as requested. 9 % of Local Authorities estimated pet ownership in their properties at less than 20 % compared to 60 % of Housing Associations. This may reflect the more limited provision of individual Housing Associations, such as only providing sheltered accommodation for older adults. The majority of all providers supplied tenants with a written ‘pet’ policy. These ranged from a single clause in the tenancy agreement to extensive additional documentation. Content analysis was conducted on the 211 policies supplied. Based on overall content and linguistic style, policies fell into four categories: prohibitive, restrictive, permissive and supportive. 72 % were permissive, with greater variability in policy type shown amongst Housing Associations. Further analysis revealed three categories of permission required for pet ownership: Implicit, Explicit and Explicit Written. In the majority of cases it was not clear how permission was obtained, nor the consequences should it be revoked. Policies tended to be framed in terms of tenant interests and accommodation circumstances. Restrictions related to the type of dwelling; type and number of pets; and their behaviour. Ambiguity in all areas of permissions / restrictions was common. For example, 80 % of policies mentioned a general requirement to “keep pets under control”. However advice on what was meant by this term, or the consequences of not doing so was specified in only a minority of submissions. Ambiguity can lead to inconsistent adherence to the policy and issues of enforcement. This may cause deterioration of relationships between tenants and housing provider. Such circumstances will result in reduced quality of life for owners (and other tenants), with possible legal proceedings and even eviction. There is potential for compromised animal and human welfare. Areas needing further consideration when drafting pet policies and how clarity might be achieved are outlined and discussed...|$|E
