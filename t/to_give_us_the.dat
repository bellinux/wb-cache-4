25|$|I {{returned}} to a Salonika destroyed. I was hoping to find my adopted brother, but rumor told that he had died of malaria in Lublin. I already knew that my parents had been burned on their first day at the extermination camp of Auschwitz. I was alone. Other prisoners who were with me had nobody either. These days, I am with a young man that I had known in Brussels. We do not separate from each other. We were both survivors of the camps. Shortly after, we married, two refugees who had nothing, there {{was not even a}} rabbi <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> blessing. The director of one of the Jewish schools served as a rabbi and we married, and so I started a new life.|$|E
500|$|For a fight scene {{taking place}} {{on top of a}} {{speeding}} bullet train, the actors and stunt performers filmed on wires above a set piece surrounded by a greenscreen. The moving background, filmed on an elevated freeway in Tokyo, was added later. Weta Digital visual effects supervisor Martin Hill said the team adopted a [...] "Google Street View method", explaining [...] "But instead of having a big panoramic cam on top of a van, we built a rig that had eight 45 degree angle Red Epic [...] that gave us massive resolution driving down all the massive lanes of the freeway. We let a bit of air out of the tires of the van and kept a constant 60 kilometers an hour. So if we shot at 48 fps we just needed to speed up the footage by 10 times <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> 300 kilometers an hour required." ...|$|E
500|$|On 21 October, {{soldiers}} again attacked an army {{barracks in}} what the New York Times said was a coup attempt against the interim government. It also cited the arrest of an unnamed dissident army captain on 27 October as the organiser of the countercoup attempt and reported that two other unnamed government critics were assaulted and left outside Bissau. Army Chief of Staff General Antonio Indjai laughed off questions {{that he was the}} power behind the throne and responded to the criticism in saying: [...] "People say I’m a drug trafficker. Anybody who has the proof, present it! We ask the international community <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> means to fight drugs." [...] Gonzalez-Ducay then responded: [...] "I can't believe that the one who controls the drug trafficking is going to fight the drug trafficking." [...] The U.S. State Department's Foreign Service Officer for Guinea-Bissau Russell Hanks, who is not present in the country following the U.S. shutting its embassy during the Bissau-Guinean Civil War in 1998, said: [...] "You will only have an impact on this transition by engagement, not by isolation. These are the people who came in {{to pick up the pieces}} after the coup." [...] His staff pointed to photographs of newly created stretches of road in a remote rural area near the Senegal border that had space for small planes to land and they suggested was under the supervision of the armed forces. Chief of Guinea-Bissau's judicial police João Biague reported on a dubious aircraft landing months before the coup near Indjai's farm. He also added that [...] "The traffickers know [...] can't do much. The agents we have in the field want to give up because they have nothing to eat." [...] Guinea-Bissau's former prosecutor general added: [...] "A country that’s not capable of discussing its own problems — it's not a country, it's not a state." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the UK, {{the book}} {{received}} wide coverage. The Economist opined {{that it had}} a ‘frightening message: the pollsters with their state-of-the-art computers, which keep a finger on the pulse of the electorate, hope they can manipulate almost any election and have ambitions to control what the people’s choice can do in office.’ Oliver Pritchett in the London Sunday Telegraph thought the book’s main concept was ‘an alarming idea, and the author... plainly intends <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> shivers.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|Ronald Reagan, {{relying on}} Graham's report and news of Hagelstein's {{breakthrough}} in 1983, was prompted {{to deliver his}} March 23, 1983, [...] "Star Wars" [...] speech. Reagan announced, [...] "I call upon the scientific community who gave us nuclear weapons to turn their great talents {{to the cause of}} mankind and world peace: <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete." [...] This speech, along with Reagan's Evil Empire speech on March 8, 1983, in Florida, ushered in the final major escalation in rhetoric of the Cold War prior to a thawing of relations in the mid-to-late-1980s.|$|E

2500|$|Anthony {{spoke in}} all 29 {{towns and villages}} of Monroe County, New York, where her trial was to be held, asking [...] "Is it a Crime for a U.S. Citizen to Vote?" [...] She said the Fourteenth Amendment gave her that right, proclaiming, [...] "We no longer {{petition}} legislature or Congress <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> right to vote, but appeal to women everywhere to exercise their too long neglected 'citizen's right'". Anthony also proclaimed,"The only question left to be settled now is: Are women persons? And I hardly believe any of our opponents will have the hardihood {{to say they are}} not. Being persons, then, women are citizens; and no state has a right to make any law, or to enforce any old law, that shall abridge their privileges or immunities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Conté's {{funeral was}} held in Conakry on 26 December. His body was put {{on display in the}} {{parliament}} building before being taken to the national stadium, where over 20,000 people were in attendance. Leaders of neighboring countries were present for the funeral. General Mamadou Ba Toto of the CNDD said at the funeral that [...] "we pray God <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> courage to continue [...] work of tolerance and peace for the welfare of Guinea". Afterwards, his body was buried the village of Lansanaya in front of his mansion. It was taken out of its coffin and placed into the ground, then covered with handfuls of dirt tossed by mourners. The burial was marked by some disorder, as thousands of mourners tried to reach the grave and security forces formed a cordon around it.|$|E
2500|$|To {{argue in}} favor of this thesis, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a {{prominent}} German philosopher, says, [...] "The senses, although they are necessary for all our actual knowledge, are not sufficient <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> whole of it, since the senses never give anything but instances, that is to say particular or individual truths. Now all the instances which confirm a general truth, however numerous they may be, are not sufficient to establish the universal necessity of this same truth, for it does not follow that what happened before will happen in the same way again. … From which it appears that necessary truths, such as we find in pure mathematics, and particularly in arithmetic and geometry, must have principles whose proof does not depend on instances, nor consequently on the testimony of the senses, although without the senses it would never have occurred to us to think of them…" ...|$|E

30|$|An {{important}} {{consequence of}} this illustration {{is that it is}} impossible for us to know other people and in particular what they do independently from ourselves without relating to our body and its movements. “Another’s reality” cannot be known as such, but only in close relation to the subject perceiving, observing and interacting with it. From this point of view an interesting hypothesis was put forward by Gallese, {{one of the members of}} the Parma team to whom we owe the discovery of mirror neurons, who predicted “the existence of ‘somatosensory’ mirror neurons that might contribute <b>to</b> <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> <b>the</b> capacity <b>to</b> identify the different body parts of others, basing them on the same parts of our own body” (Gallese, 2003, p. 39).|$|R
