40|$|A hybrid method {{consisting}} of employing the mode matching method {{in conjunction with}} the Fourier transform technique is used to analyze the radiation of the dominant <b>TEM-wave</b> from an impedance loaded parallel-plate waveguide. The hybrid method that we adopt here reduces the related boundary value problem to a scalar modied Wiener-Hopf equation of the second kind. The solution involves in nitely many unknown constants satisfying an innite system of linear algebraic equations susceptible to a numerical treatment. Some computational results illustrating the eects of various parameters on the radiation phenomenon are also presented. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Dirichlet {{problem for}} Laplace's {{equation}} {{in an area}} between two arbitrary profiled infinitely long cylinders is rigorously solved by the Method of Regularization. The obtained solution {{is applied to the}} accurate analysis of the shielded micro-strip line with homogeneous dielectric filling and thick conductor - the structure supporting the transmission of an ideal <b>TEM-wave.</b> Capacitance and characteristic impedance are calculated for different shapes of transmission line profile with an accent on the near rectangular profile modelled by the super-quadric equation. Effect of the finite conductor thickness on characteristic impedance is comprehensively examined. 4 page(s...|$|E
40|$|An unsymmetric coupler {{has been}} {{designed}} for a pla-nar mn-wave (120 GHz) structure. Measurement results, which verify the design, are also presented. The coupler design is based on three requirements: matching to the feeding waveguide, proper phase advance (namely half the phase advance of other cells) and surface fields compara-ble {{to those of the}} inner cells (to control dark current). This design differs from conventâ€™ional coupler designs by two points. First, the structure is open and special care is necessary t,o avoid the excit. ation of <b>TEM-waves.</b> Second, because of the small size of the structure, the geometry is adapted to micro-mechanic fabricational techniques (e. g.
