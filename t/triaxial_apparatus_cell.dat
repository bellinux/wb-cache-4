40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{interpret}} the natural anisotropy of a soil using new experimental transducers called bender and extender elements in a <b>Triaxial</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>Apparatus.</b> Firstly a specimen had to be prepared with a desired relative density using a technique called Pluviation. Secondly a tricky procedure had to be overtaken in order to install and protrude the transducers in the sample properly. The third step was {{to set up the}} <b>Triaxial</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>Apparatus</b> and apply an isotropic pressure to the soil sample. That done, a good interpretation of the signal waves passing through the sample in either vertical or horizontal directions had to be well understood. The final step is to apply some wave formulae in order to asses some results. All the data obtained was then compared with recent research done by Dr Tarek Sadek (Bristol, 2007) as a PhD student at the University of Bristol. The degree of anisotropy, the elastic shear and constrained modulus in the field of very small strains were the data studied and compared in detail. One of the most important difficulties encountered was to set up properly the whole device bearing in mind that for the horizontal transducers there was no space already done so a new development needed to be invented. Some big troubles were created but thanks to some advice from my supervisors and from the technician they were overtaken. Another issue found was how to interpret wave output data because first of all its signal some times was particularly not clear and secondly because there was not an objective method to assess it without doubt. Therefore, some wave theory has been explained by the author as well as some improvements to try to achieve the best interpretation with the minimum subjectivity...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} the hydraulic properties of soils, accurate prediction of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is needed which is commonly {{derived from the}} soil water release characteristic. In fine-textured soils the modified Mualem-van Genuchten (MMVG) function has been used extensively to predict the change in relative conductivity with changes in matric potential, but this assumes that the soil is rigid with a constant porosity (CP) which is unrealistic for shrinking soils. We used a <b>triaxial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>apparatus</b> to accurately monitor soil volume changes during water release in a clay soil. From this we derived relative hydraulic conductivity functions based on either MMVG (CP), or based on geometrically-similar shrinkage (GSS) of all pore sizes by a constant factor as calculated from measured shrinking porosity (SP). The MMVG (CP) function predicted a decline in relative conductivity of up to three orders of magnitude from 0 to- 400 kPa matric potential. This was similar to published data on the response of conductivity in the same soil to consolidation of larger pores. However, based on SP, the soil remained effectively tension-saturate...|$|R

40|$|Several well {{established}} techniques of soil stabilisation and soil reinforcement {{are available to}} improve properties of geotechnical materials. However, the addition of fibre into soils has its unique potential as a reinforcing agent. This is because a friction between fibre and soil particles increases the bonding between the particles of soils and this can improve the plasticity, stress-strain behaviour and failure characteristics of both cemented and uncemented soils. It also reduces the brittleness of the cemented sand. Numerous experiments on fibre-reinforced granular materials {{have been carried out}} by several researchers. However, the behaviour of fibre-reinforced cemented granular soils has not been fully understood yet. Furthermore, most experimental studies of fibre reinforced cemented materials have been carried out at relatively low confining pressures. As a result, more experiments are still needed to understand complicated behaviour of soil-cement-fibre composite materials. The main objective of this thesis is to analyse the behaviour of fibre reinforced cemented sand under wide range of confining pressures. For this GDS high pressure <b>triaxial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>apparatus</b> and Bishop and Wesley conventional <b>triaxial</b> <b>cell</b> <b>apparatus</b> have been used to carry out the tests at wide range of confining pressures from 50 kPa to 20 MPa. Drained and undrained tests have been carried out on polypropylene fibre reinforced sand with and without the addition of cement. Samples with varying fibre and cement content were prepared by the method of undercompaction and were cured for 28 days prior to testing. The experimental results indicate that there is a significant effect from the addition of fibre and/or cement contents and confining pressures on the mechanical behaviour of Portaway sand. Particularly, these effects were noted in drained and undrained triaxial tests, particularly peak strength, strength parameters, shear banding, particle crushing, yielding, and stress-dilatancy relationships. The addition of fibres increases the peak, yield, and ultimate strengths. Increase in confining pressure also increases the strength but the individual effect of the addition of fibres was more pronounced at low confining pressures. Progressive suppression in the dilation by the gradual increase in confining pressures as well as an increase in dilation with the addition of fibres during triaxial compression was also worth noticeable. Although, no noticeable affect was observed in isotropic compression due to the addition of fibre in both cemented and uncemented sand. An extensive series of tests were carried out but due to time constraint only one type and length of fibre was used. Therefore, more research needs to be carried out at different fibre lengths and types in order to see that whether these change the behaviour observed in this research.

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} a laboratory-based experimental study into {{the rate of}} loading effect on the mechanical behaviour of an unsaturated pyroclastic soil. The study includes equipment design and laboratory testing which are addressed to analyze the rate of loading influence by means of equip-ment modification and suction controlled triaxial tests. The studied material, characterized by its very low density, {{is typical of the}} area around Naples where natural slopes are covered by loose silty sands of pyroclastic erupted by Vesuvius and by other volcanoes. The analyzed soil is a volcanic ash constituted by non plastic silty sand with pres-ence of pumices. The equipment design component of this research consists of the development of specialized de-vices: <b>triaxial</b> <b>apparatusses</b> and suctions probes. Two similar <b>triaxial</b> <b>apparatuses</b> capable of testing unsaturated samples under suction-controlled condition (USPv 2) were developed. The main new feature of the USPv 2 is the inclusion of a double drainage system to shorten the testing time. As two are the devices constructed, preliminary evaluation tests were performed on similar samples under similar stress conditions to assess the repeatability of tests independently of the apparatus used. On the other hand, two different types of high capacity tensiometers were developed. One of them is an integral strain-gauged tensiometer and the other one a commercial-transducer based ten-siometer. Both of them include solutions allowing the easy substitution of their parts. For each ten-siometer, a saturation process and a saturation system were designed; the main condition for these tasks was the application of relative low pre-pressurization pressure (800 kPa). To evaluate the per-formance of the tensiometers free evaporation tests, prolonged high suction measurements and pres-sure reversals tests were carried out. Based on the tests results, the commercial-transducer based probe was selected to be used with the USPv 2 <b>triaxial</b> <b>apparatus</b> in order to monitor pore-water pressure during suction-controlled isotropic compression tests. The laboratory-testing program of this study includes three series of tests. Isotropic compression (first serie) and deviator stage (second serie) at different stress-rate and strain-rate, respectively, were performed using the <b>triaxial</b> <b>apparatus</b> USPv 2. During isotropic compression stages the load-ing rates of 2, 8, 32, 128 kPa/h have been applied under several constant suction values (i. e. 0, 15, 45 and 300 kPa). The drained deviator stages were carried out at the same suctions levels under strain rates of 0. 25 and 2. 50 %/h. In order to study the effect of loading rate on pore-water pressure variations, a third serie of test was conducted. Suction-controlled isotropic compression tests with pore-water pressure measurement were carried out by means the USPv 2 <b>triaxial</b> <b>apparatus</b> used in combination with the commercial-transducer based tensiometer. The capacity to apply both fluid pressures to the top and the bottom of the sample significantly shortens the equalization stage. During isotropic compression stage, as the loading rate is increased the rigidity of the soil also increase, however, a loading rate value was identified from which no dif-ference was observed. The study also suggests that the excess pore-water pressure generated during isotropic loading process, that may reduce the suction value, is less significant than the creep phe-nomena for the pyroclastic soil studied. For the deformation velocities studied on deviator stage, non effect was observed on the soil behaviour. Finally, the control of pore-air pressure and pore-water pressure by both sample sides, accompanied by a short testing program addressed to deter-mine rational testing rates, reduce a lot the testing time...|$|R

However, research work {{on the behavior of}} granitic soils at small strains has not attracted much attention, despite the fact that many countries around the world are underlain by granitic saprolites. In the study reported in this paper, shear stiffness of a natural granitic saprolite from Hong Kong has been investigated in the field, using the self-boring pressuremeter and geophysical techniques such as the suspension P-wave and S-wave logging method, and in the laboratory, using a <b>triaxial</b> <b>apparatus</b> equipped with internal displacement measuring devices. The observed stiffness-strain relationships of the natural granitic saprolite are highly nonlinear at small strains. Shear stiffness decreases significantly as shear strain increases.

In laboratory, the small strain behavior is examined by different techniques including the bender element method for measuring the maximum shear modulus and local displacement transducer (LDT) for measuring Young's modulus at small strains.

It has been observed that discontinuities are known to develop when such geological materials are subject to loading.
