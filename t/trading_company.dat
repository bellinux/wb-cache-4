50|$|However, {{publicly}} <b>traded</b> <b>companies</b> {{also have}} advantages over their closely held counterparts. Publicly <b>traded</b> <b>companies</b> often have more working capital and can delegate debt throughout all shareholders. Therefore, shareholders of publicly <b>traded</b> <b>company</b> will each take {{a much smaller}} hit to their returns {{as opposed to those}} involved with a closely held corporation. Publicly <b>traded</b> <b>companies,</b> however, can suffer from that advantage. A closely held corporation can often voluntarily take a hit to profit with little to no repercussions if it is not a sustained loss. A publicly <b>traded</b> <b>company</b> often comes under extreme scrutiny if profit and growth are not evident to stock holders, thus stock holders may sell, further damaging the company. Often, that blow is enough to make a small public company fail.|$|R

Accordingly, there are new requirements and responsibilities for auditors of publicly <b>traded</b> <b>companies.</b> In effect, the emergence of separate auditing standards for publicly <b>traded</b> <b>companies</b> and for companies that are not publicly traded is creating two distinct fields of auditing. These changes require a different approach to teaching auditing to accounting students. This article proposes one approach to teaching these significant changes for entry level auditors...|$|R

Later that year, his grandfather arranged a job for him in Cape Town, South Africa, {{in the office of}} a Swedish company that sold construction material. After six months in South Africa, he took a new job at a branch office of the Holland Bank in Haifa.

However, later price standardizations by the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908 hastened Méliès's financial ruin, as his films were impractically expensive under the new standards. In addition, in the years following 1908 his films suffered from the fashions of the time, as the fanciful magic films he made were no longer in vogue.|$|E
5|$|In the films, Sparrow {{is one of}} {{the nine}} pirate lords in the Brethren Court, the Pirate Lords of the Seven Seas.

Sparrow is introduced seeking to regain his ship, the Black Pearl, from his mutinous first mate, Hector Barbossa. Later he attempts to escape his blood debt to the legendary Davy Jones while battling the East India <b>Trading</b> <b>Company.</b>|$|E

5|$|More goods became {{available}} in St. Louis during the economic recovery, {{largely as a}} result of the new steamboat power. Wholesalers, new banks, and other retail stores opened starting in the late 1820s and early 1830s. The fur trade continued as a major industry into the 1830s. In 1822, Jedediah Smith joined William H. Ashley's St. Louis fur <b>trading</b> <b>company.</b> Smith would later be known for his explorations of the West and for being the first American to travel overland to California. New fur trade companies such as the Rocky Mountain Fur Company pioneered trails west. Although beaver fur lost its popularity in the 1840s, St. Louis continued as a hub of buffalo hide and other furs.|$|E

Hess attended a German language Protestant school in Alexandria from 1900 to 1908, when he {{was sent back to}} Germany to study at a boarding school in Bad Godesberg.

In France, black-and-white prints sold for 560, and hand-colored prints for 1,000. Méliès also sold the film indirectly through Charles Urban's Warwick <b>Trading</b> <b>Company</b> in London.|$|E
