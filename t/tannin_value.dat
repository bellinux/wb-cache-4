40|$|Shrub legumes {{have been}} well {{established}} in Indonesia and some of which contain significant levels of tannin. Several methods of tannin analysis have been conducted and correlated with its biological property of tannin. Total phenolics and total tannin measured by Folin Ciocalteau have a high correlation with the biological assay of tannin using gas in vitro method. <b>Tannin</b> <b>values</b> measured by the above methods negatively correlated with protein digestibility. Several feeding experiments on tannin containing shrub legumes using Calliandra calothyrsus as a model plant have been conducted. Feeding in fresh condition or silage form {{is the best way}} of feeding tannin containing forages. Several methods were tested to deactivate tannin include PEG addition, soaking in water or alkaline solution. Starch addition is one of the alternatives to mask the effect of tannin as it improved the performance of sheep fed tannin-containing legumes. Cofeeding with other leguminous leaves is another technique to utilize tannin in shrub legumes as protein binding agent. Several experiments showed that tannin could reduce the worm burden in ruminant although its utilization as anthelminthic agent in Indonesia is still limited. In conclusion, tannin containing shrub legumes have several beneficial effects to improve small ruminant production. ...|$|R
40|$|Termite {{is used in}} {{many parts}} of the world but little is known about their {{biochemical}} properties and nutritional value as food. Protein digestibility and anti-nutrients of four castes (queen, worker, soldier and winged (alate)) of subterranean termite, Macrotermes subhyalinus were determined to evaluate the protein bioavailability and confirm nutritional value as food for human and animal consumption. Physico-chemical properties of the oil of each caste were also determined to reveal the potential uses of the oil and its stability in storage using standard analytical methods. The queen was the most easily digestible (84. 72 %) of the castes while the soldier was the least with a digestibility value 81. 10 %. The queen was significantly more digestible than the other castes. In general, all the four castes have low anti-nutrient (oxalate, phytate and <b>tannin)</b> <b>values.</b> Among the castes, worker has significantly higher anti-nutrient levels than the other castes. In general, worker and soldier have relatively higher digestibility values and significantly higher anti-nutrient contents as well as relatively higher values for most of the physico-chemical parameters tested, suggesting that they are the least edible caste. Overall, the results showed that all four castes of M. subhyalinus have very low levels of anti-nutrients tested for, are easily digested and produce edible oil. These findings confirm that all four castes of M. subhyalinus, and possibly other termite species, are safe for human and animal consumption, and therefore recommended for inclusion in human foods and livestock feeds...|$|R

Alkaloids, polyphenols, cyanogenic glycosides and saponins are among the main chemical compounds synthesized by plants but not considered essential for their basic metabolism. These compounds have different functions in plants, and have been recognized with medicinal and pharmacological properties. In this research, concentrations of the mentioned secondary metabolites were determined in the medicinal plants Artemisia absinthium, Cnidoscolus aconitifolius, Parthenium hysterophorus, Piper carpunya and Taraxacum officinale, from Ecuador, and related with cytotoxic effects against Artemia salina. Alcoholic and aqueous extracts from leaves of these selected plants were prepared at different concentrations. To assess cytotoxicity of these extracts, different bioas-says with A. salina were undertaken, and the mortality rates and LC 50 were obtained. Besides, concentrations of alkaloids, cyanogenic glycosides, phenols, tannins and saponins were determined by spectrophotometric methods, this constituted the first report of quantification of secondary metabolites in the selected plants from Ecuador.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) could be effectively used to determine the protein and tannin content of sorghum. In addition, tannin content of whole and progressively dehulled sorghum grain was predicted using NIRS. The protein content of sorghum grain grown in 1983 / 84 and 1984 / 85 was analyzed by the Kjeldahl method and ranged from 7. 4 to 16. 7 % and 8. 4 to 15. 1 %, respectively. Tannin content was analyzed using five different methods; vanillin hydrochloric acid assay with an extraction time of 24 hr (V-HCl/ 24 hr), V-HCl/ 20 min, modified vanillin hydrochloric acid assay with an extraction time of 24 hr (MV-HCl/ 24 hr), MV-HCl/ 20 min, and Prussian blue assay with an extraction time of 10 min (PB/ 10 min). The correlation coefficients between the methods for tannin analysis ranged from 0. 94 to 0. 99. Protein content of sorghum grain was predicted with reasonable accuracy using NIRS. The standard error of prediction corrected for machine bias (SEPc) 0. 43 %, ratio of range/SEPc (20. 8), and correlation coefficient (r) between the protein content analyzed by the Kjeldahl method and protein content predicted by NIRS was 0. 99 (p < 0. 01, n = 28) for the 1983 / 84 crop year; while the values for the 1984 / 85 crop year were SEPc (0. 28 %), ratio of range/SEPc (16. 5) and r = 0. 99 (p < 0. 01, n = 20). It was found that when the 1983 / 84 prediction equation was used to predict protein content in the 1984 / 85 crop year the SEPc was 0. 35 %, range/SEPc was 13. 8, and r was 0. 98 (p < 0. 01, n = 20) while when the 1984 / 85 prediction equation was applied to the sorghum lines grown in 1983 / 84 the SEPc was 0. 75 %, range/SEPc was 12. 4 and r was 0. 99 (p < 0. 01, n = 28). The SEPc and range/SEPc for the whole sorghum grain was 3. 54 % and 2. 82, respectively. The correlation coefficient (0. 66, p < 0. 01, n = 20) between the V-HCl/ 24 hr assay and the NIRS method was low but significant. The technique appears not to be suitable for tannin analysis in whole sorghum grain.

40|$|Protein-energy {{malnutrition}} {{and mineral}} deficiencies {{are two of}} the three forms of nutritional deficiencies that affect most developing countries due to inadequate access to food and diets based on a sole crop. Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the staple crop of Nicaragua and {{it has the potential to}} improve the nutritional status of the poorest group of the nation. Its high content of both protein and nonhaem iron provides many nutrients, but inhibitors also may prevent absorption of iron and zinc by the human consumer. A proper production chain must be followed to ensure the best grain quality for the consumer. To achieve food security, both production and high nutritional content must be maintained. Four nationally important accessions of common bean, with different harvesting dates, were selected to be submitted to two treatments: to evaluate the impact of storage conditions on the end quality of the grain. The duration of the study was six months with sampling every six weeks, and the two treatments were controlled one stored at 40 °C and 75 RH %, and the other was stored in in-situ conditions. Proximate and mineral composition was evaluated as well as tannin, phytate and bioavailability. Significant differences among different accessions were found, being the most significant in protein, Fe and Zn content, tannins and phytate. Protein values ranged from 21 - 23 %. Iron content was 61 - 81 mg/kg but only 3 - 4 % was bioavailable. Zinc content was 21 - 25 mg/kg and 10 - 12 % was bioavailable. The concentration of phytate ranged from 8. 6 - 9. 6 mg/g while <b>tannin</b> <b>values</b> ranged within 37. 7 - 43. 8 mg/g.

40|$|The study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} drying; methods on chemical composition of spinach, aleifo (Amaranthus aquatica) and pumpkin leaf (Telfairia occidentalis) and their soup meals. The two vegetables were purchased from local market in Unale-Ibaji Local Government Area, Kogi State, Nigeria in bulk. These two vegetables were washed, cleaned, plucked from the stalk and processed to mimic traditional methods of preserving vegetables. The vegetables were divided into three equal portions. The first portion served as the control, {{the second and third}} portions were sun and shade dried. Aliquots of the dried samples were pulverized, sieved, packaged in polythene bags and kept in cool dry place until used for various chemical analysis. The other dried portions as well as their controls (fresh) were used for preparation of soup meals. The chemical composition of the vegetables and their soup meals were determined using current standard methods. Sun and shade drying drastically reduced moisture content of the vegetables when compared to the controls (84. 47 - 7. 80 and 7. 42 %). The protein for the sun and the shade dried samples were higher than those of the controls (3. 50 and 4. 70 vs 6. 47, 5. 50 and 5. 77 and 5. 44 %, respectively) (p< 0. 05). Ash, fat and fibre content of the dried samples were also higher. Carbohydrate values for the two vegetables were slightly high and comparable (47. 36 and 48. 40 %) than those of the controls. Calcium, iron and zinc of the fresh samples were higher than those of the dried samples. Drying comparably increased energy from 131. 37 - 198 and 197 kcal, each. Drying increased iodine and decreased -carotene and ascorbate as against the controls. Drying equally decreased phytate and tannins relative to their controls. The moisture values for soup prepared with dried vegetables were lower than those prepared with fresh vegetables. The dry matter (protein, fat, ash and carbohydrate) for the soups prepared with dried vegetables were much higher than those prepared with fresh vegetables. On the other hand, calcium, iron, zinc and iodine values for soups prepared with fresh vegetables were higher than those prepared with fresh vegetables were higher than those prepared with dried vegetables. Phytate and <b>tannins</b> <b>values</b> for soups based on dried vegetables were lower than those based on fresh vegetables. Fresh vegetables had higher iron, vitamin A and ascorbate than the dried vegetables. Shade drying had an edge in increasing iron, iodine, zinc, pro-vitamin A and ascorbate over sun drying.

Compositional analysis illuminated that both garlic verities/line are good source of protein and minerals. Regarding bioactive molecules extraction, methanol exhibited highest polyphenols than that of ethanol and water. The pink garlic extracts showed higher FRAP, DPPH, flavonoids, flavonols, ABTS and <b>tannins</b> <b>values</b> in comparison with garlic white. Moreover, amount of allicin was also higher in pink garlic. On the basis of in vitro characterization with special reference to antioxidant potential, pink garlic preparations were selected for the development of functional soup and further used in bioevaluation trial. Accordingly, four types of chicken garlic soups were prepared after adding whole garlic, garlic powder and garlic oil @ 2, 2 and 1 g/ 100 mL serving, correspondingly along with control. The developed chicken garlic soups were subjected to physico-chemical analysis during storage that elucidated non-momentous effect on total soluble solids (TSS) while pH and acidity affected substantially. Likewise, color of the soups affected non-significantly with storage and treatments except for a* value. Sensory response of the functional soup remained within normal range during storage. Afterwards, efficacy study in rats was carried out through two consecutive trials I & II for the validity of results. Bioevaluation study comprised of four groups of rats feeding on whole garlic, garlic powder and garlic oil @ 250, 250 and 100 mg/kg bodyweight, respectively alongside control. The consumption of different garlic treatments imparted non-substantial effect on feed and drink intake during entire study. Likewise, cholesterol and LDL were significantly reduced by different garlic preparations however, pronounced decrease as 11. 05 & 9. 45 and 17. 21 & 15. 37 % was noticed for whole garlic in trial I & II, respectively. The significant increase in HDL was also recorded in rats rely on whole garlic from 35. 36 ï¿½ 2. 37 to 39. 73 ï¿½ 2. 54 and 33. 25 ï¿½ 2. 11 to 37. 22 ï¿½ 2. 11 mg/dL. Similarly, triglycerides were momentously reduced from 68. 52 ï¿½ 4. 65 to 61. 17 ï¿½ 4. 31 and 68. 61 ï¿½ 4. 25 to 63. 42 ï¿½ 4. 13 mg/dL in trial I & II, respectively. The attenuation in serum glucose of rats is an indicator for the positive impact of garlic treatments on this trait. In this context, garlic oil performed better than rest of the treatments and reduced glucose from 85. 40 ï¿½ 5. 12 to 81. 12 ï¿½ 5. 23 and 88. 68 ï¿½ 5. 20 to 82. 98 ï¿½ 5. 14 mg/dL in respective trials. Likewise, garlic oil consumption resulted 7. 79 & 8. 33 % increase in insulin higher than that of whole garlic and garlic powder 3. 62 & 4. 38 and 6. 03 to 6. 79 % in trial I & II. Similarly, garlic preparations especially garlic oil imparted substantial increase in bleeding time (BT), prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) with significant decrease in plasma fibrinogen (Fg) and platelet aggregation (PG) thus soothing thrombosis. The antioxidant potential of rats was also improved as evident from enhanced serum glutathione and suppressed thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), xanthine oxidase (XO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO).

40|$|Grape pomace {{provides}} {{a rich source}} of polyphenols that have the capacity to act as powerful antioxidants. An experiment was conducted to study the effect of inclusion of grape pomace concentrate (GPC) at levels of 15, 30, and 60 g/kg and α-tocopheryl acetate (200 mg/kg) in broiler chicks (21 to 42 d of age) on performance; digestive organ sizes; protein; fat; hydrolyzable polyphenol and condensed tannin digestibilities; the antioxidant activity of diet, serum, ileal content, and excreta; and the susceptibility to oxidation of breast meat during refrigerated storage. The inclusion of GPC did not affect the performance; the apparent ileal digestibility of CP; the relative abdominal fat, liver, pancreas, and spleen weight; and the relative intestinal length. Fat digestibility was reduced in birds fed control and GPC diets compared with birds fed vitamin E. Ileal and fecal digestibility of hydrolyzable polyphenols and condensed <b>tannins</b> reached <b>values</b> in a range of 56 to 73 % and 14 to 47 %, respectively. The GPC diets reduced ileal and fecal digestibility of hydrolyzable polyphenols. Antioxidant activity in GPC diet, ileal content, and excreta [2, 2 -azinobis (3 -ethilenzotiazolin) - 6 -sulfonate method] and GPC diet (ferric antioxidant power method) exhibited higher scavenging free radical capacity than control and vitamin E diets. The lipid oxidation in breast meat was lower in the birds fed the supplemented vitamin E diet than the control diet after 1, 4, and 7 d of refrigerated storage. Oxidative stability in breast meat at 1, 4, and 7 d of storage was equivalent in GPC diets compared with the vitamin E diet. In conclusion, the inclusion of GPC (up to 60 g/kg) did not impair chicken growth performance, digestive organ sizes, and protein digestibility. Hydrolyzable polyphenols were more bioavailable than condensed tannins. Antioxidant activity in diet, excreta, ileal content, and breast muscle were increased in GPC diets. The GPC supplementation was equally as effective in antioxidant potential as vitamin E. On the basis of these observations, we concluded that GPC could be a new source of antioxidant in animal nutrition. © 2008 Poultry Science Association Inc.

40|$|Tannins {{have been}} largely studied as wood {{additives}} and wood adhesives. In a perspective of a desirably increased utilization of natural raw material in the wood timber industries, this study provides further and specific information {{on the use of}} condensed tannins to improve the heat resistance of urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. The results obtained by thermomechanical and thermogravimetric analyses show that high percentage (33 and 50 %) of quebracho tannin in UF-tannin blend dramatically improves the overall UF thermal resistance, but 50 % of tannin decreases the maximum value of modulus of elasticity (MOE) of the bonded joint. The best balance between mechanical performance and decreased degradation at high temperature is obtained with 33 % of quebracho <b>tannin.</b> The MOE <b>value</b> of UF + 33 % of quebracho tannin at 260 A degrees C is seven times greater than MOE of UF control. Thermograms show that quebracho tannin has a beneficial effect on increasing the resistance of glue-mix to degradation induced by temperature. When the content of tannin in the glue-mix is increased up to 50 %, the resin degrades completely at about 670 A degrees C, i. e. more than 50 A degrees C higher than neat UF resin. This improvement is related mainly to the resorcinol-type ring structure of tannin and the alkaline pH of UF + quebracho tannin glue mix that confer a higher resistance against joint degradation to UF even at elevated temperatures...|$|R
