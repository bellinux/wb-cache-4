In the 1840s the building was reinforced with iron rods inserted between the floors. In 1854, the federal government hired West Point engineering graduate (and Louisiana native) Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard to fireproof the building, rebuild the arches supporting the basement ceiling and install masonry flooring. Beauregard completed the work in conjunction with Captain Johnson K. Duncan by 1859. During this period, the Mint's heavy machinery was converted to steam power so a smokestack (since demolished) was built at the rear of the structure to carry away the fumes.|$|E

25|$|The {{classical}} way {{of showing}} the distortion inherent in a projection is to use Tissot's indicatrix. For a given point, using the scale factor h along the meridian, the scale factor k along the parallel, and the angle θ′ between them, Nicolas Tissot described how to construct an ellipse <b>that</b> <b>characterizes</b> <b>the</b> amount and orientation {{of the components of}} distortion. By spacing the ellipses regularly along the meridians and parallels, the network of indicatrices shows how distortion varies across the map.|$|E

25|$|One way {{to prove}} would be to find a {{differential}} equation <b>that</b> <b>characterizes</b> <b>the</b> gamma function. Most special functions in applied mathematics arise as solutions to differential equations, whose solutions are unique. However, the gamma function {{does not appear to}} satisfy any simple differential equation. Otto Hölder proved in 1887 that the gamma function at least does not satisfy any algebraic differential equation by showing that a solution to such an equation could not satisfy the gamma function's recurrence formula, making it a transcendentally transcendental function. This result is known as Hölder's theorem.|$|E
25|$|Corporations {{are created}} as legal persons {{by the laws}} and {{regulations}} of a particular jurisdiction. These may vary in many respects between countries, but a corporation's legal person status is fundamental to all jurisdictions and is conferred by statute. This allows the entity to hold property {{in its own right}} without reference to any particular real person. It also results in the perpetual existence <b>that</b> <b>characterizes</b> <b>the</b> modern corporation. The statutory granting of corporate existence may arise from general purpose legislation (which is the general case) or from a statute to create a specific corporation, which was the only method prior to the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|While the {{hardware}} {{components in the}} Internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software <b>that</b> <b>characterizes</b> <b>the</b> Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting contributions and standards are published as Request for Comments (RFC) documents on the IETF web site. The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the Internet Standards. Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.|$|E
25|$|Author (and U.S. Senator) Jim Webb puts forth {{a thesis}} {{in his book}} Born Fighting (2004) {{to suggest that the}} {{character}} traits he ascribes to the Scotch-Irish such as loyalty to kin, extreme mistrust of governmental authority and legal strictures, and a propensity to bear arms and to use them, helped shape the American identity. In the same year that Webb's book was released, Barry A. Vann published his second book, entitled Rediscovering the South's Celtic Heritage. Like his earlier book, From Whence They Came (1998), Vann argues that these traits have left their imprint on the Upland South. In 2008, Vann followed up his earlier work with a book entitled In Search of Ulster Scots Land: The Birth and Geotheological Imagings of a Transatlantic People, which professes how these traits may manifest themselves in conservative voting patterns and religious affiliation <b>that</b> <b>characterizes</b> <b>the</b> Bible Belt.|$|E
25|$|Party group {{switching}} in the European Parliament is {{the phenomenon}} where parliamentarians individually or collectively switch from one party {{group to the}} other. The phenomenon of EP party group switching is a well-known contributor to the volatility of the EP party system and highlights the fluidity <b>that</b> <b>characterizes</b> <b>the</b> composition of European parliamentary groups. On average 9% of all MEPs switch during legislative terms. Party group switching is a phenomenon that gained force especially in the legislatures during the 1990s, up {{to a maximum of}} 18% for the 1989-1994 term, with strong prevalence among representatives from France and Italy, though by no means limited to those two countries. There is a clear tendency of party group switches from the ideological extremes, both left and right, toward the center. Most switching takes place at the outset of legislative terms, with another peak around the half-term moment, when responsibilities rotate within the EP hierarchy.|$|E
