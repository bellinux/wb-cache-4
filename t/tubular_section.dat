25|$|Body armour in the Macedonian {{army was}} derived from a repertiore found {{throughout}} the Greek-speaking world. The {{most common form of}} armour was the linothorax, which was a cuirass of stiff linen built up of glued or stitched layers of textile; though it is possible that linen was used as a facing material over leather. It was composed of the 'girdle' a <b>tubular</b> <b>section,</b> often of four vertical panels, that enclosed the torso. A shoulder-piece was attached to the upper rear section of the girdle, this element was split into two wings which were pulled forward over the top of each shoulder and laced to the chest-section of the girdle. Ancient representations show the shoulder pieces standing vertical when not laced down to the chest of the corselet. This suggests that the linothorax as a whole was very stiff and inflexible. Pteruges, strips of linen or leather, protected the upper arms and hips of the wearer. The linothorax could be reinforced with plate bronze or bronze scale elements. Defences of a similar appearance composed of quilted textile are also described.|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} investigations on cold-formed stainless steel <b>tubular</b> <b>sections</b> subjected to web crippling {{performed by the}} authors are summarized in this paper. The web crippling test results of cold-formed stainless steel <b>tubular</b> <b>sections</b> subjected to four loading conditions specified in the American and the Australian/New Zealand specifications are presented in this paper. Moreover, web crippling tests conducted under end and interior loading conditions to simulate a floor joist member seated on a solid foundation subjected to a concentrated load are also reported, and these loading conditions are not currently specified in the specifications. All of these test results are compared with the design strengths obtained using the American, the Australian/New Zealand and the European specifications fo cold-formed stainless steel members {{as well as the}} North American specification for oldformed carbon steel structural members. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are either unconservative or very conservative for high strength stainless steel <b>tubular</b> <b>sections.</b> Hence, a unified web crippling equation with carefully calibrated coefficients for cold-formed stainless steel <b>tubular</b> <b>sections</b> is proposed. Furthermore, tests on combined bending and web crippling are also described in this paper. The test strengths are also compared with the design strengths obtained using the American and the Australian/New Zealand specifications. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative for <b>tubular</b> <b>sections</b> subjected to combined bending and web crippling. In addition, the yield line mechanism analysis is used to investigate the web crippling behaviour of cold-formed stainless steel <b>tubular</b> <b>sections.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Strengthening of {{aluminium}} {{and stainless steel}} structural <b>tubular</b> <b>sections</b> using adhesive bonded fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) subjected to web crippling has been investigated. Aluminium and stainless steel <b>tubular</b> <b>sections</b> may experience web crippling failure due to local concentrated loads or reactions. The web crippling strength can be enhanced by strengthening the webs of the sections in localized regions. The current international specifications {{of aluminium}} and stainless steel structures do not provide web crippling design rules for strengthening of <b>tubular</b> <b>sections.</b> Therefore, {{there is a need}} to develop safe and reliable web crippling design rules for FRP strengthened aluminium and stainless steel structures. An extensive test program was performed on FRP strengthening of aluminium and cold-formed stainless steel <b>tubular</b> <b>sections</b> subjected to web crippling. The test specimens consisted of 6061 -T 6 heat-treated aluminium alloy, ferritic stainless steel type EN 1. 4003 and lean duplex type EN 1. 4162 square and rectangular hollow sections. A total of 254 web crippling tests was conducted in this study. The tests were performed on eighteen different sizes of <b>tubular</b> <b>sections</b> which covered a wide range of web slenderness (flat portion of web depth-to-thickness) ratio from 6. 2 to 62. 2. The web crippling tests were conducted under the four loading conditions according to the American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures, namely End-Two-Flange, Interior-Two-Flange, End-One-Flange and Interior-One-Flange loading conditions. The investigation was mainly focused on the effects of different adhesive, FRP, surface treatment, widths of FRP plate and web slenderness of <b>tubular</b> <b>sections</b> for strengthening against web crippling. Six different adhesives, six different FRPs, two different surface treatments, three different widths of FRP plate were considered. It was found that the web crippling capacity of aluminium <b>tubular</b> <b>sections</b> are significantly increased due to FRP strengthening, especially for those sections with large value of web slenderness. The web crippling strength can be increased up to nearly 3 times using the appropriate adhesive and FRP for aluminium <b>tubular</b> <b>sections,</b> whereas the web crippling strength can be increased up to 51 % and 76 % for ferritic and lean duplex stainless steel <b>tubular</b> <b>sections,</b> respectively. The finite element models for FRP strengthened aluminium and stainless steel tubular structural members subjected to web crippling were developed and calibrated against the experimental results. The debonding between FRP plate and aluminium or stainless steel tubes was carefully modelled using cohesive element. It is shown that the calibrated model closely predicted the web crippling strengths and failure modes of the tested specimens. An extensive parametric study included 212 web crippling specimens was carried out using the verified finite element models to examine the behaviour of strengthened aluminium and stainless steel <b>tubular</b> <b>sections</b> subjected to web crippling. Design equations are proposed to predict the web crippling strengths of FRP strengthened aluminium and stainless steel <b>tubular</b> <b>sections</b> based on the experimental and numerical results. The web crippling strengths obtained from the tests and numerical analysis were compared with the design strengths calculated using the proposed equations. The reliability of the proposed design rules was evaluated using reliability analysis. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

These reduction factors along with the factors given in the current design codes were then used in the numerical modelling of stub columns to determine their failure loads at various elevated temperatures.

The study aims to explore the hydride generation technique which is normally coupled with efficient thermal source to apply determination of heavy metals in water samples via spectrometric analysis. The arsenic hydride generation process and the atomization of the generated hydride in a quartz cell atomizer were studied analytically as model case studies. The hydride generation (HG) process was analyzed by adopting two hypotheses, the nascent hydrogen and formation of intermediate hydroboron species, where the results based on the second hypothesis are found to be more realistic for design purposes. Moreover, the release of the gener-ated hydride from the liquid phase and their transport to the gas phase is simulated in a helical <b>tubular</b> <b>section,</b> in which the actual <b>tubular</b> <b>section</b> length required for separation is deduced.

Numerical analysis of 2 -dimensional non-load carrying thin-walled cruciform joints was performed to determine the effect of weld profile and weld undercut on fatigue crack propagation life under cyclic tensile loading. The cruciform joints analysed are made up of 3 mm thick plates, joined by fillet welds. The Boundary Element Analysis System Software (BEASY) is used, which uses fracture mechanics theory to carry out crack propagation analysis. The weld profiles and weld undercuts were measured from welded connections in thin-walled fillet welded sections. The measured weld profiles and undercut were used in the analysis. The results are compared with those of a similar study to determine the comparative reduction in fatigue crack propagation life between thin-walled cruciform joints (T= 3 mm) and thicker walled cruciform joints (T= 20 mm). This paper provides an understanding of the impact which weld toe undercut has on the fatigue crack propagation life of thin-walled cruciform joints.

A {{series of tests}} was performed on fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) strengthening of aluminium tubular structural members subjected to End-Two-Flange and Interior-Two-Flange loading conditions. A total of 58 web crippling tests was conducted. The investigation was mainly focused {{on the effects of}} different adhesive and FRP for strengthening of aluminium <b>tubular</b> <b>sections</b> against web crippling. The influence of different widths of FRP plate strengthening against web crippling has been also investigated in this study. The test specimens consisted of 6061 -T 6 heat-treated aluminium alloy square and rectangular hollow sections. Six different adhesives and six different FRPs were considered in this study. The properties of adhesive and FRP have significant influence on the effectiveness of the strengthening. Most of the strengthened specimens were failed by debonding of FRP plates from the aluminium tubes. There are mainly four different failure modes observed in the tests, namely the adhesion, cohesion, combination of adhesion and cohesion, and interlaminar failure of FRP plate. The failure loads, failure modes, and the load-web deformation behaviour of the aluminium sections are presented in this study. It was found that the web crippling capacity of aluminium <b>tubular</b> <b>sections</b> is significantly increased due to FRP strengthening, especially for those sections with large value of web slenderness ratio. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
