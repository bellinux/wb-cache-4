'Twas a little, round, firm, <b>tight</b> <b>face,</b> with a seam {{here and there}} left by the smallpox, {{but not enough to}} hurt his looks in a woman's eye, though he'd had it badish when he was a boy. So very serious looking and unsmiling 'a was, that young man, that it really seemed as if he couldn't laugh at all without great pain to his conscience. He looked very hard at a small speck in your eye when talking to 'ee. And there was no more sign of a whisker or beard on Tony Kytes's face than on the palm of my hand.

[...] By loosening the fiador knot, the <b>tight</b> <b>face</b> can be pressed towards, over, and around the rest of the knot.

[...] The rationale stated is that the single loop and free end side of the knot will be subject to more spreading when it passed around the neck of the horse. By contrast, the strands on the two-loop side of the fiador knot will generally be kept together by the double hackamore knot immediately below it.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{theory and}} evidence that tighter credit constrains force firms to produce lower quality. The paper develops a quality sorting model that predicts that <b>tighter</b> credit constraints <b>faced</b> by a firm reduce its optimal prices {{due to its}} choice of lower-quality products. Conversely, when quality cannot be chosen by a firm in an efficiency sorting model, prices increase as firms <b>face</b> <b>tighter</b> credit constraints. An empirical analysis using Chinese bank loans data and a merged sample based on Chinese firm-level data and Chinese customs data strongly supports quality sorting and confirms the mechanism of quality adjustment...|$|R

The patient inhaled a mixture of vapor and air, and expired air was forced into a charcoal adsorbent via a one-way valve. Oxygen was administered simultaneously.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the credit constraints faced by a firm and the unit value prices of its exports. The paper modifies Arkolakis’s (2010) model of trade with heterogeneous firms by introducing endogenous quality and credit constraints. The model predicts that <b>tighter</b> credit constraints <b>faced</b> by a firm reduce its optimal prices as its choice of lower-quality products dominates the price distortion effect resulting from credit constraints. However, a competing theory based on the alternative assumption that quality is exogenous across firms would predict completely opposite results: Prices increase as firms <b>face</b> <b>tighter</b> credit constraints. An empirical analysis using Chinese bank loans data, Chinese firm-level data from theNational Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC), and Chinese customs data strongly supports the predictions of the endogenous-quality model. Moreover, the predictions of the exogenous-quality model are supported by using quality-adjusted prices in regression analy-sis. In addition, we confirm the mechanism of quality adjustment: firms optimally choose t...|$|R

50|$|Steiger {{was very}} popular at home. He only faced one close reelection contest, in 1974. That year, he only held onto office by 3,073 votes.

30|$|The second {{potential}} explanation are financial constraints. Displaced households could <b>face</b> <b>tighter</b> financial constraints due to {{the loss}} of their social network for credit or the lack of property they could use as collateral. Unfortunately, financial assets are not included in the survey to infer about financial constraints. Even if financial constraints are not binding now, the expectation that they will bind in the future would already induce households cut back on expenditures today (Deaton 1991).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} (i) {{the relationship}} between the credit constraints faced by a firm and the unit value prices of its exports, as well as (ii) {{the relationship between}} the export prices of a firm and its productivity. The paper extends Melitz’s (2003) model of trade with het-erogeneous firms by introducing endogenous quality, credit constraints and marketing costs. There are three key findings. First, there exists a positive relationship between firm produc-tivity and export prices because the choice of higher-quality inputs is associated with higher productivity. Second, <b>tighter</b> credit constraints <b>faced</b> by a firm reduces its optimal prices as its choice of lower-quality inputs dominates the price distortion effect resulting from credit con-straints. Third, if one adopts the alternative assumption that quality is exogenous across firms, then completely opposite results would be expected: there would be a negative relationship between prices and productivity; prices increase as firms <b>face</b> <b>tighter</b> credit constraints. An empirical analysis using Chinese bank loans data, Chinese firm-level data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC), and Chinese customs data strongly supports the predic-tions of the endogenous-quality model, and confirms the existence of the quality adjustmen...|$|R

This finding is supported by the analysis of a sample of 95 Mexican microenterprises, and by the estimation of a production optimization model. microenterprises, costs, increasing returns and economies of scale. ...|$|R
