She was joined by Guam, two light cruisers, and Destroyer Squadron 47. On the night of 2728 March, she fired forty-five 12-inch shells and three hundred and fifty-two 5-inch rounds at the island. The ships rejoined TG 58.4 at a refueling point, after which they returned to Okinawa to support the landings when they began on 1 April. On the evening of 11 April, Alaska shot down one Japanese plane, assisted {{in the destruction of}} another, and claimed what might have been an Ohka piloted rocket-bomb. On 16 April, the ship shot down another three aircraft and assisted with three others. Throughout the rest of the month, her heavy anti-aircraft fire succeeded in driving off Japanese bombers.|$|E

5|$|Other {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} detection of alcohol dependence, such as the Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire, which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE questionnaire. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use. The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses, driving under the influence being the most common. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization, is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation. The Paddington Alcohol Test (PAT) was designed <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>for</b> alcohol-related problems amongst those attending Accident and Emergency departments. It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time. Certain blood tests may also indicate possible alcoholism.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) is a {{human rights}} violation that is pervasive worldwide, and is particularly critical for women during the reproductive period. IPV includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Nurses on in-patient postpartum units are well-positioned <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> women <b>for</b> IPV, yet low screening rates suggest that barriers <b>to</b> <b>screening</b> exist. The {{purpose of this study}} was to (a) identify the frequency of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> IPV, (b) the most important barriers <b>to</b> <b>screening,</b> (c) the relationship between the barriers <b>to</b> <b>screening</b> and the frequency of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> types of abuse, and (d) to identify other factors that contribute to the frequency of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> IPV. Methods In 2008, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 96 nurses from postpartum inpatient units in three Canadian urban hospitals. The survey included the Barriers to Abuse Assessment Tool (BAAT), adapted for postpartum nurses (PPN). Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models were used to predict barriers <b>to</b> <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> each type of IPV. Results The frequency of screening varied by the type of abuse with highest <b>screening</b> rates found <b>for</b> physical and emotional abuse. According to the BAAT-PPN, lack of knowledge was the most important barrier <b>to</b> <b>screening.</b> The BAAT-PPN total score was negatively correlated with <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Using OLS regression models and after controlling for demographic characteristics, the BAAT-PPN explained 14 %, 12 %, and 11 % of the variance in <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> physical, sexual and emotional abuse, respectively. Fluency in the language of the patient was negatively correlated with <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> each type of abuse. When added as Step 3 to OLS regression models, language fluency was associated with an additional decrease in the likelihood of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> physical (beta coefficient = -. 38, P P =. 05), and emotional abuse (beta coefficient = -. 48, P Conclusions Our findings support an inverse relationship between rates of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> IPV and nurses' perceptions of barriers. Barriers <b>to</b> <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> IPV, particularly related to knowledge and language fluency, need to be addressed to increase rates of screening on postpartum units. </p...|$|R
