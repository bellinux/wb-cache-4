A comparison of calculated Mn 3 d density-of-states and experimental valence photoemission and x-ray-absorption results suggests that the monolayer is antiferromagnetic, in line with earlier predictions. A similar comparison for the Pd(100) -Mn-c(2 X 2) alloy formed after annealing to 570 K suggests a two-layer-thick alloy consisting of Pd and Mn atoms arranged in a checkerboard pattern. Core level photoemission {{results are consistent with}} this conjecture in that three different types of Pd atoms bonded to Mn atoms are found. Total energy calculations demonstrate, however, that a Pd-capped Cu 3 Au structure is energetically more favorable, but the system is not able to reach this state at the used annealing temperature. Kinetic thresholds must be overcome by heating and this is shown by the experimental trend in which the Mn atoms are situated at the surface at lower temperatures.

40|$|In this thesis, {{functionalization}} of monolayer honeycomb lattices {{and their}} allotropes is investigated, including graphene, silicene, germanene, and MoS 2, with theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) {{implemented by the}} Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) code. The atomic structure of graphene is that of an sp 2 bonded planar lattice. The band structure indicates that graphene is a semimetal with a Dirac cone at the K-point. Silicene and germanene have mixed sp 2 -sp 3 buckled hexagonal structures and display similar electronic properties to those of graphene. Single-layer MoS 2 features a hexagonal packed layer composed of Mo atoms sandwiched between two layers of S atoms {{and appears to be}} a nonmagnetic semiconductor. In order to alter the metallic properties, various adatoms are introduced on the graphene surface. A single H atom on top of a carbon atom in graphene pulls the bonded C atom out of the plane and creates a magnetic moment of 1 μ B for graphene. Single F and O adatoms on graphene are adsorbed at the top site and bridge site, respectively, without any contribution of magnetic moment. The adsorption of a single F atom on graphene was found to be metallic. Single H and O adatoms on graphene transform the system into a semiconductor. Under the inspiration of the graphene allotropes, new types of silicene allotropes, octasilicene, silicyne, and silicdiyne, are constituted and found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>buckled</b> metallic materials. To fill unsatisfied valence shells and replace the dangling bonds with valence bonds in silicene allotropes, hydrogen atoms were introduced on silicene allotropes. Consequently, all the hydrogenated silicene allotropes appear to be semiconductors. The type of adsorption in which the dangling bonds are completely replaced by valence bonds is proved to be more stable, suggesting that the Si atom favors sp 3 hybridization. Fluorinated germanene keeps the chair configuration characteristic of pure germanene, which is the most stable configuration, {{but there is also a}} metallic structure for both types of fluorinated germanene. The O atom was used to study the functionalization of single-layer MoS 2. The top of an S atom site is the most energetically favorable position, and the oxygen atom at this site results in a direct gap. The electronic structures of a series of isostructural compounds, M 2 SiO 4 (M = Mn, Co, and Ni), belonging to the olivine family, are studied by first principles calculations. The results show that the ground states of all the compounds are antiferromagnetic, which is consistent with the experimental results. The effects of the various M site ions on the crystal structure, spin states, orbitals, and electronic states, for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic magnetic states are investigated. Two- and three-dimensional Ising–like models for a triangular spin-chain lattice are proposed to study the magnetic properties of a newly discovered triangular compound, Sr 3 Co 2 O 6, using Monte Carlo simulation. Simulations based on both of the two models show a multistep curve at low T, magnetization plateaus at M = 1 / 3 MO, where MO is the saturated magnetization, at intermediate T and paramagnetic behaviour at high T. The width of the plateau becomes larger as interactions increase...|$|E
40|$|Coastal ice {{includes}} {{the parts of}} the sea ice that are stressed and deformed by tidal motion; the ice foot (the inner part that is frozen to the ground) and the hinge zone (the zone where cracking occurs due to tidal elevation of the floating ice). This thesis presents in situ measurements of first-year coastal ice conducted in a sound close {{to the head of the}} fjord Van Mijenfjorden, Sval- bard, in the period between January and May 2014. During in total 6 field trips measurements of temperature, salinity, density, thickness and freeboard were done both on the coastal ice and on the free-floating ice. The latter was done at a point 200 m offshore. Temperature oscillations with periods similar to the tides and amplitudes up to 0. 5 ◦C were found inside the ice in the hinge zone during a 10 -days period, indicating a high permeability of the ice. Since the ice there was grounded at low tide and floating at high tide, the water level was constantly varying relative to the ice and could thereby drive a column of brine/seawater up and down through the ice cover. This observation corresponded well with the calculated average permeabilities, which were much higher before the temperature oscillations occurred (2. 3 · 10 − 11 m 2) than after they had disappeared (1. 1 · 10 − 11 m 2). Freeboard and surface water measurements discovered buckling of the ice in the lower parts of the hinge zone, which varied with the tide. In May, the ice was clearly buckled at high tide and stretched out at low tide. Creation of new ice inside the tidal cracks, caused by inflow of water during the tidal cycle, and thermal expansion are factors suggested to cause elongation of the ice sheet. Since the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, the ice is more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>buckled</b> at high tide than at low tide when it is lowered in the middle of the sound. Maximum recorded amount of surface water was 18 cm, and through the season at least 20 cm of superimposed ice had been accumulating on the ice in the lower parts of the hinge zone. During cold periods, growth rates in the different parts of the ice varied; the ice foot was hardly growing at all, the free-floating ice was growing in moderate rates, whereas in the hinge zone the maximum growth was very high. The largest recorded ice thicknesses were 84 cm in the free-floating ice and 171 cm in the hinge zone. In the lower parts of the hinge zone the average ice temperatures were warmer than in the free-floating ice. Both the rapid growth and the temperature differences are expected to be caused by frequent flooding of the ice in the lower parts of the hinge zone, which often resulted in creation of a new layer of ice on top of the original layer. The release of latent heat connected to this process, in addition to direct heating by the warmer surface water, is believed to be the main reason for the warmer ice. Also along the shore, large spatial variations in ice thickness were observed; two shore- perpendicular sections going across the hinge zone, 11 m from each other, showed that the maximum ice thickness differed with 70 cm. Mean salinities in the ice foot were relatively low, varying from 0. 6 to 1. 2 ppm, whereas in the hinge zone they varied between 4. 9 and 7. 2 ppm. In the free-floating ice, average salinities between 4. 7 and 6. 6 ppm were recorded...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} a study of a {{low-cost}} structurally efficient minimum-gage shear-panel design {{that can be used}} in light helicopters are presented. The shear-panel design is based on an integrally stiffened syntactic-foam stabilized-skin with an all-bias-ply tape construction for stabilized-skin concept with an all-bias-ply tape construction for the skins. This sandwich concept is an economical way to increase the panel bending stiffness weight penalty. The panels considered in the study <b>were</b> designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>buckling</b> resistant up <b>to</b> 100 lbs/in. of shear load and to have an ultimate strength of 300 lbs/in. The panel concept uses unidirectional carbon-epoxy tape on a syntactic adhesive as a stiffener that is co-cured with the skin and is an effective concept for improving panel buckling strength. The panel concept also uses pultruded carbon-epoxy rods embedded in a syntactic adhesive and over-wrapped with a bias-ply carbon-epoxy tape to form a reinforcing beam which is an effective method for redistributing load around rectangular cutout. The buckling strength of the reinforced panels <b>is</b> 83 <b>to</b> 90 percent of the predicted buckling strength based on a linear buckling analysis.

40|$|The use of {{advanced}} carbon fibre-reinforced composites in aircraft primary structures {{has been steadily}} increasing over past two decades due to their high specific strength and stiffness, and their tailoring as per the need. The composite panels used in primary structures of aircraft <b>are</b> liable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>buckling</b> during its service periods. It is observed that structures can withstand substantial amount of loads after they have buckled. Therefore, an approach to efficiently design the postbuckled composite structures <b>is</b> required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> developed. The designers {{of the next generation}} of aircraft are looking into the aspect of postbuckling composite structures to achieve substantial improvements in aircraft structural efficiency. In this work, the postbuckling response and growth of circular delamination in flat and curved composite plates are investigated for different delamination sizes and their locations through the laminate thickness. The prediction of delamination initiation and growth is carried out using the strain energy release rates obtained from the finite element analysis and comparing them to B-K's mixed-mode fracture criterion. The failure load is thus predicted. Predicted results for onset of delamination growth compared well with experimental results. Its variation with different delamination sizes and their locations across panel thickness was also investigated. It is observed that the failure loads are influenced by the delamination sizes depending on their locations across the laminate thickness. The different delamination sizes at H/ 3 laminate thickness did not have significant effects on the variations of compressive strengths of the delaminated composite panel. But, the compressive strengths of the panels having different delamination sizes at H/ 2 laminate thickness are more than that at H/ 3 and increase linearly with increase in delamination sizes...|$|R
