As the Democratic Party assumed control of the House {{following}} the 2006 elections, Boehner served as Minority Leader from January 2007 until January 2011. When Republicans reassumed control of the House of Representatives in January 2011, Boehner was elected as Speaker, with the votes of all 241 of his fellow Republicans. In 2014, some House Republicans reached out to Ben Carson about his interest in becoming Speaker should <b>they</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to oust Boehner; Carson declined, citing his impending candidacy for president. Boehner's Republican opponents formed a congressional caucus, called the Freedom Caucus, in January 2015 to focus their opposition. Though Boehner was reelected as Speaker {{at the beginning of the}} 114th United States Congress that month, 25 conservative members of the Republican caucus did not vote for him. Daniel Webster, a Republican from Florida, received 12 votes.|$|E

Another enforced rule is that travelers can only move between machines located at different times using the same core: as such, {{it is impossible for}} the characters to travel back before the first power-up of the core, nor would <b>they</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to travel between different time machines as the cores would be different.

The story continues the adventures of the creature Gizmo (once again voiced by Howie Mandel), who spawns numerous small monsters when wet. In the first film, Gizmo's offspring rampaged through a small fictional town. In Gremlins 2, Gizmo multiplies within a skyscraper in New York City.
