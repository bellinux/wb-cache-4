5|$|Lima flourished {{during the}} 17th century as <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{extensive}} trade network which integrated the Viceroyalty of Peru with the Americas, Europe and the Far East. Its merchants channeled Peruvian silver through the nearby port of Callao and exchanged it for imported goods at the trade fair of Portobelo in modern-day Panama. This practice was sanctioned by law as all trade from the Viceroyalty {{was required to}} go through Callao {{on its way to}} and from overseas markets. The resulting economic prosperity of the city was reflected in its rapid growth, population expanded from about 25,000 in 1619 to an estimated 80,000 in 1687.|$|E

5|$|The Akkadian {{period was}} {{followed}} by period N, during which Nagar was <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> independent Hurrian dynasty, evidenced by {{the discovery of a}} seal, recording the name of king Talpus-Atili of Nagar, who ruled during or slightly after the reign of Naram-Sin's son Shar-Kali-Sharri. The view that Tell Brak came under the control of Ur III is refused, and evidence exists for a Hurrian rebuilding of Naram-Sin's palace, erroneously attributed by Max Mallowan to Ur-Nammu of Ur. Period N saw a reduction in the city's size, with public buildings being abandoned, and the lower town evacuated. Few short lived houses were built in area CH during period N, and although greatly reduced in size, archaeology provided evidence for continued occupation in the city, instead of abandonment.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Lima, {{the capital of}} Peru, began with its {{foundation}} by Francisco Pizarro on January 18, 1535. The city was established on {{the valley of the}} Rímac River in an area populated by the Ichma polity. It became the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru and site of a Real Audiencia in 1543. In the 17th century, the city prospered as <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extensive trade network despite damage from earthquakes and the threat of pirates. However, prosperity came to an end in the 18th century due to an economic downturn and the Bourbon Reforms.|$|E

5|$|Colross, (also {{historically}} {{known as}} Belle Air and Grasshopper Hall), is a Georgian mansion in Princeton, New Jersey; {{it was built}} as <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> estate in the Old Town neighborhood of Alexandria, Virginia. Colross is currently the administration building of Princeton Day School. The Colross property originally occupied the entire 1100 block of Oronoco Street; Alexandria merchant John Potts developed it as a plantation and began building the mansion in 17991800. In 1803, Jonathan Swift—also an Alexandria merchant and a city councilman—purchased the property and during his ownership continued constructing the mansion. After Swift's death in 1824, Colross was purcheased by Thomson Francis Mason (1785–1838), son of Thomson Mason (1759–1820) and grandson of Founding Father George Mason (1725–1792) of Gunston Hall. Mason served as a judge of the Criminal Court of the District of Columbia and as mayor of Alexandria. During his ownership, Mason made Colross his chief homestead; he substantially modified and added to the mansion. After successive ownerships, the area around Colross became heavily industrialized. The mansion was bought by John Munn in 1929; between that year and 1932 it was transported brick-by-brick to Princeton, where in 1958 it was sold to Princeton Day School, which uses it as a school administration building housing its admission and advancement offices.|$|E
5|$|Infamous (stylized as inFAMOUS) is an action-adventure {{video game}} {{developed}} by Sucker Punch Productions {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 3. The game was released in North America on May 26, 2009, in Europe on May 29, 2009, in Australia on June 4, 2009 and in Japan on November 5, 2009. In Infamous, the player controls the protagonist Cole MacGrath, a bike messenger caught in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explosion that devastates several city blocks of the fictional Empire City. The explosion sends the city into chaos while Cole finds himself with new electricity-based super powers.

These choices ultimately affect character growth, {{the reaction of the}} City's populace towards Cole, and finer elements of gameplay and the story.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1870, flags {{were created}} for the Japanese Emperor (then Emperor Meiji), the Empress, and for {{other members of the}} {{imperial}} family. At first, the Emperor's flag was ornate, with a sun resting in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> artistic pattern. He had flags that were used on land, at sea, and when he was in a carriage. The imperial family was also granted flags to be used at sea and while on land (one for use on foot and one carriage flag). The carriage flags were a monocolored chrysanthemum, with 16 petals, placed {{in the center of a}} monocolored background. These flags were discarded in 1889 when the Emperor decided to use the chrysanthemum on a red background as his flag. With minor changes in the color shades and proportions, the flags adopted in 1889 are still in use by the imperial family.|$|E
