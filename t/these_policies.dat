5|$|Justinian {{entered the}} arena of ecclesiastical statecraft shortly after his uncle's {{accession}} in 518, {{and put an end}} to the Acacian schism. Previous Emperors had tried to alleviate theological conflicts by declarations that deemphasized the Council of Chalcedon, which had condemned Monophysitism, which had strongholds in Egypt and Syria, and by tolerating the appointment of Monophysites to church offices. The Popes reacted by severing ties with the Patriarch of Constantinople who supported <b>these</b> <b>policies.</b> Emperors Justin I (and later Justinian himself) rescinded <b>these</b> <b>policies</b> and reestablished the union between Constantinople and Rome. After this, Justinian also felt entitled to settle disputes in papal elections, as he did when he favoured Vigilius and had his rival Silverius deported.|$|E

5|$|After {{the revolt}} had largely been suppressed, those who {{accepted}} Ottoman suzerainty were initially allowed {{to retain their}} holdings and partial autonomy. Many timars were also granted to local Albanians holding high posts of the administration, especially during the rule of Jakub Muzaka and Skanderbeg. Throughout the pacification process, various primarily rural areas were still in revolt and new rebellions erupted, like that of Teodor Korona Muzaka in 1437. As the empire further extended its area of rule in the Balkans, centralization attempts and the replacement of local timar holders with Ottoman landowners resumed. <b>These</b> <b>policies</b> would lead {{in part to the}} formation of the League of Lezhë under Skanderbeg in 1444, and a new era in the Ottoman–Albanian wars.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he was not}} {{prominently}} {{involved in}} the May Revolution that deposed Cisneros, he was appointed as secretary of war of the new government, the Primera Junta.

5|$|Though Houston is {{the largest}} city in the United States without formal zoning regulations, it has {{developed}} similarly to other Sun Belt cities because the city's land use regulations and legal covenants have played a similar role.

5|$|With {{the peace}} treaty concluded, Macrinus took {{measures}} to control the expenditures of Rome, by reversing Caracalla's changes and thus effectively reinstating the fiscal policies of Septimius Severus.

5|$|A primary {{theme of}} the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to {{socialism}} by education, not by force.

Starobin, p 207. The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that <b>these</b> <b>policies</b> superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced.

5|$|After Leonid Brezhnev assumed {{power in}} 1964, much of Khrushchev's reforms were reversed.

When the earthquake hit on the morning of December 7, 1988, the houses and apartments least able to resist collapse were those built during the Brezhnev years.
