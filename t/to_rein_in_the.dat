5|$|Emperor Gaozong {{supported}} settling a {{peace treaty}} with the Jurchens and sought <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> assertiveness of the military. The military expeditions of Yue Fei and other generals were an obstacle to peace negotiations. The government weakened the military by rewarding Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and Zhang Jun (1086–1154) with titles that relieved them of their command over the Song armies. Han Shizhong, {{a critic of the}} treaty, retired. Yue Fei also announced his resignation as an act of protest. In 1141 Qin Hui had him imprisoned for insubordination. Charged with treason, Yue Fei was poisoned in jail on Qin's orders in early 1142. Jurchen diplomatic pressure during the peace talks may have played a role, but Qin Hui's alleged collusion with the Jin has never been proven.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's speech signalled his {{intention}} <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SA, whose ranks had grown {{rapidly in the}} early 1930s. This would not prove to be simple, however, as the SA made up {{a large part of}} Nazism's most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of the Great Depression, when many German citizens lost both their jobs and their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively– or even primarily– a working class phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many unemployed workers for class solidarity and nationalist fervour. Many stormtroopers believed in the socialist promise of National Socialism and expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When the Nazi regime did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned.|$|E

Andronikos's energetic efforts <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oppressive tax collectors and officials of the empire did much to alleviate the lot of the peasantry. However, his efforts to check the power of the nobility were considerably more problematic.

Andronikos seemed almost to seek the extermination of the aristocracy as a whole. The struggle against the aristocracy turned into wholesale slaughter, as the emperor resorted to ever more ruthless measures to shore up his regime.|$|E
5|$|Óláfr's {{marriage}} to the daughter of one of Alexander the King of Scots' most trusted northern lords, and the lord's assistance rendered to Óláfr and Páll, may suggest that Óláfr had gained Alexander's approval against Rögnvaldr. In the summer following the defeat of Guðrøðr on Skye, the chronicle states that Óláfr took hostages from the Hebridean portion of the kingdom and, with a fleet of 32 ships, landed on Mann and confronted Rögnvaldr directly. It was then agreed that the kingdom would be split between the two—with Rögnvaldr keeping Mann itself along with the title of king, and Óláfr retaining the Hebridean portions. In the 1220s Alexander began to extend Scottish royal authority into what is today the western coast Scotland, making several expeditions into Argyll. A this time Ruaidrí may have been forced from his lands in Kintyre and replaced by Alexander, installing Domnall mac Ragnaill, a more palatable member of Clann Somairle, in his place. Óláfr's control of Lewis and Skye, bordering the domains of Clann Somairle, may have made him appear as a potentially valuable ally to Alexander's eyes, who wished <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more dangerous members of Clann Somairle.|$|E

The Note first shows how plaintiffs can bring a case that runs the gauntlet of procedural and justiciability challenges to actually reach a merits review. It then shows how judges should apply the international law of war to adjudicate the lawfulness of drone strikes. Adjudicating the legality of drone strikes for their compliance with the international law of war is an eminently legal task that our courts should feel compelled to carry out. Adherence to the rule of law, our constitutional separation of powers, and our national security interests all speak for ex post judicial review of drone strikes...|$|R

40|$|Two {{aspects of}} {{corruption}} are examined theoretically: {{its effect on}} macroeconomic variables, and its determination from the political environment. Corruption is defined in an occupational choice model as the extra fees or bribes that must be paid by some entrepreneurs. Even {{in an environment of}} perfect information and well-defined property rights, wages and total output decrease with the level of corruption. Inverted-U relationships of income inequality with both corruption and output are calculated. Second, two types of decentralization, regional and bureaucratic, are analyzed. The effects depend crucially on agents' mobility across regions. Under imperfect mobility assumptions, corruption decreases with regional decentralization and increases with bureaucratic decentralization. Two methods of controlling corruption are analyzed in this setting: democratic accountability and incentive payments. The same factor that makes bureaucratic decentralization more corrupt makes it more resistant <b>to</b> efforts <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> corruption; <b>the</b> reverse is true for regional decentralization. This model matches emerging stylized facts relating corruption to output, inequality, and decentralization, and reinterprets findings linking bureaucratic wage levels and corruption.

At the other end are those who place drone strikes effectively beyond judicial review by encouraging only internal executive branch procedures. This Note stakes out the middle ground between the extremes and argues that ex post judicial review by Article III courts is the most effective constitutional check on the drone program. Ex post judicial review is the best solution because it avoids the constitutional and national security problems presented by an ex ante drone court, while satisfying the separation of powers and remedial requirements sorely lacking when the executive remains unchecked by the judiciary...|$|R

500|$|The {{earliest}} medieval Poor Law was the Ordinance of Labourers {{which was}} issued by King Edward III of England on 18 June 1349, and revised <b>in</b> 1350. <b>The</b> ordinance was issued <b>in</b> response to <b>the</b> 1348–1350 outbreak of <b>the</b> Black Death <b>in</b> England, when an estimated 30–40% {{of the population}} had died. <b>The</b> decline <b>in</b> population left surviving workers in great demand <b>in</b> <b>the</b> agricultural economy of Britain.

40|$|Since {{the demise}} of {{philosophical}} foundationalism {{and that of the}} Aristotelian idea of an inner meaning of words, scholarship about international law is no longer perceived as a mining activity geared towards the extraction of pre-existing meaning. Rather, international legal scholarship {{is in a state of}} fierce competition for persuasiveness and semantic authority. This does not elevate persuasiveness into the determinant of legality, nor does it lead to a total rejection of the internal point of view. The configuration of that competition for naming is informed by the current structure (and the membership) of the interpretative community of international law. In this competition for naming, words constitute semantic weaponry. Mention is made here of uses of words in international law to create textual economy, generate semantic instability, rough out and hone scholarly ideas, enhance textual aesthetics, yield empiricism, create straw men and preserve the argumentative character of scholarly idea, gratify oneself, boost fame and careers, and intimidate peers. It is also argued that there is nothing <b>to</b> <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use of such semantic tactics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interpretative community of international law, for paradigmatic revolution is meant to be permanent.

40|$|Abstract—Reducing {{the long}} {{tail of the}} query latency dis-tribution in modern {{warehouse}} scale computers is critical for improving performance and quality of service of workloads such as Web Search and Memcached. Traditional turbo boost increases a processor’s voltage and frequency during a coarse-grain sliding window, boosting all queries that are processed during that window. However, the inability of such a technique to pinpoint tail queries for boosting limits its tail reduction benefit. In this work, we propose Adrenaline, an approach to lever-age finer granularity, 10 ’s of nanoseconds, voltage boosting <b>to</b> effectively <b>rein</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tail latency with query-level precision. Two key insights underlie this work. First, emerging finer granularity voltage/frequency boosting is an enabling mechanism for intelli-gent allocation of the power budget to precisely boost only the queries {{that contribute to the}} tail latency; and second, per-query characteristics can be used to design indicators for proactively pinpointing these queries, triggering boosting accordingly. Based on these insights, Adrenaline effectively pinpoints and boosts queries that are likely to increase the tail distribution and can reap more benefit from the voltage/frequency boost. By evaluating under various workload configurations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology. We achieve up to a 2. 50 x tail latency improvement for Memcached and up to a 3. 03 x for Web Search over coarse-grained DVFS given a fixed boosting power budget. When optimizing for energy reduction, Adrenaline achieves up to a 1. 81 x improvement for Memcached and up to a 1. 99 x for Web Search over coarse-grained DVFS. I...|$|R
