As early as 1934 or 1935 Bob Dunn electrified a Martin O-series acoustic guitar while playing with Milton Brown's Brownies. According to Jimmy Thomason, [...] "It happened when Dunn {{was working at}} Coney Island in New York...he ran into this black guy who was playing a steel guitar with a homemade pickup attached to it...hooked up to this old radio or something and was playing blues licks...and he got this guy to show him how he was doing it. I never knew this black musician's name but both Bob and Avis <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> him often." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dupri also {{demonstrated}} {{the possibility for}} a duet with Jackson and American singer Mariah Carey for the album. Carey commented in April 2006, [...] "He never <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> that, but if Jermaine has a concept, we should go and write something. I love Janet. I’ve been {{a big fan of}} Janet since 'Con-tro-ol!'". Later, Dupri said that the closer he got to Jackson and Mariah's duet, the more he knew where it should be at, elaborating that he felt it was going to happen. [...] "It depends on how quick my mind moves. We’re mixing records for [...] We’re not done yet. When I did Usher's My Way album, the last record I created was 'You Make Me Wanna...'. I'm thinking I might go back in, and I might tamper with it. [...] We gotta try to figure it out", he commented. However, the duet never came to fruition.|$|E
2500|$|Ralph Parcaut {{was born}} in Iowa on December 3, 1896. His parents, Edward and Eva Parcaut, were farmers who, in 1894, had settled {{on a farm in}} Grant Township an area near Sutherland a small town in O'Brien County, Iowa. [...] They had a family of seven children. From an early age, Parcaut took a keen {{interest}} in wrestling with other boys and began to demonstrate considerable aptitude for the sport. In 1906, at the age of 15, a local wrestling fan, impressed with Parcaut's talent and potential, gave him $100.00, a considerable sum of money at the time, to seek training from famed wrestler and instructor Martin [...] "Farmer" [...] Burns. [...] At the time, Burns operated a school for wrestlers in Omaha, Nebraska where he taught [...] "catch as catch can" [...] or modern day freestyle wrestling and physical training. [...] Parcaut traveled to Omaha, his $100.00 buying him 10 lessons, as Farmer Burns charged $10.00 an hour for one-on-one wrestling instruction with students. [...] Burns instilled in young Parcaut what would become a lifelong regimen of training and most importantly, [...] "clean living." [...] As Parcaut recalled years later, [...] "I'll never forget the first time I met him in Omaha ... All {{the way back to the}} gymnasium he <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the evils of drink and of smoking and even urged me not to partake of tea or coffee." ...|$|E
