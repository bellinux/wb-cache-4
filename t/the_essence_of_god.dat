5|$|Some have {{interpreted}} Bahá'u'lláh's writing style {{to conclude that}} Bahá'u'lláh had claimed divinity.

5|$|Thomas Aquinas, while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his Summa Theologica, objected to Anselm's argument. He suggested that people cannot know {{the nature of}} God and, therefore, cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed. The ontological argument would be meaningful only to someone who understands <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>God</b> completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His essence, only He could use the argument. His rejection of the ontological argument caused other Catholic theologians to also reject the argument.|$|E

In Eastern Orthodox theology, God's uncreatedness or being or essence in Greek is called ousia. Jesus Christ is the Son (God Man) of the uncreated Father (God).

25|$|The {{first seven}} spheres of Heaven deal solely with the {{cardinal}} virtues of Prudence, Fortitude, Justice and Temperance. The first three describe a deficiency {{of one of}} the cardinal virtues– the Moon, containing the inconstant, whose vows to God waned as the moon and thus lack fortitude; Mercury, containing the ambitious, who were virtuous for glory and thus lacked justice; and Venus, containing the lovers, whose love was directed towards another than God and thus lacked Temperance. The final four incidentally are positive examples of the cardinal virtues, all led on by the Sun, containing the prudent, whose wisdom lighted the way for the other virtues, to which the others are bound (constituting a category on its own). Mars contains the men of fortitude who died in the cause of Christianity; Jupiter contains the kings of Justice; and Saturn contains the temperate, the monks who abided by the contemplative lifestyle. The seven subdivided into three are raised further by two more categories: the eighth sphere of the fixed stars that contain those who achieved the theological virtues of faith, hope and love, and represent the Church Triumphant– the total perfection of humanity, cleansed of all the sins and carrying all the virtues of heaven; and the ninth circle, or Primum Mobile (corresponding to the Geocentricism of Medieval astronomy), which contains the angels, creatures never poisoned by original sin. Topping them all is the Empyrean, which contains <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>God,</b> completing the 9-fold division to 10.|$|E

50|$|During {{the medieval}} period, {{the impossibility of}} {{reconciling}} the abstract concept <b>of</b> <b>God</b> <b>of</b> Greek philosophy with the personal <b>God</b> <b>of</b> the Bible, led Jewish thinkers, such as Maimonides, to try to eliminate the remaining myths and to modify the figure <b>of</b> the living <b>God.</b> After this time, mysticism, {{as an effort to}} find again <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>God</b> <b>of</b> their fathers, became more widespread.|$|R

50|$|In all of {{the five}} {{currents}} we have described, we start with man. We {{try to understand the}} type of being we are. We strive for perfection and God helps us. We find our true being in dialogue--with God the Eternal Thou, responding and calling to us. We sense the Ineffable--and God is the reality behind all reality, who is concerned with us and suffers with our failures, and rejoices in our achievements. We are threatened with meaninglessness--and God relates to us, saving us from the dead-ends of life. We find men capable of the most unspeakable deeds--and therefore we must address the Hidden God so that we can help Him bring about the redemption. Thus the idea <b>of</b> <b>God</b> is related to the idea of man.

He was a {{merchant}} from Shiraz in Qajar Iran who, at the age of twenty-four (on the evening of May 22, 1844), claimed to be an inspired interpreter of the Qur'an within the Shaykhi school of Twelver Shi'ism.

2500|$|Medieval, rationalist Jewish {{philosophers}} (exponents of [...] "Hakirah"-rational [...] "investigation" [...] {{from first}} principles {{in support of}} Judaism), such as Maimonides, describe Biblical Monotheism to mean {{that there is only}} one God, and His essence is a unique, simple, infinite Unity. Jewish mysticism gives a deeper explanation, by distinguishing between God's essence and emanation. In Kabbalah and especially Hasidism, God's Unity means that there is nothing independent of His essence. The new doctrine in Lurianic Kabbalah of God's Tzimtzum ("Withdrawal"), received different interpretations after Isaac Luria, from the literal to the metaphorical. To Hasidism and Schneur Zalman, it is unthinkable for the [...] "Withdrawal" [...] of God that [...] "makes possible" [...] Creation, to be taken literally. Tzimtzum only relates to the Ohr Ein Sof ("Infinite Light"), not the Ein Sof (Divine essence) itself. God's true infinity is revealed in both complementary infinitude (infinite light) and finitude (finite light). The [...] "Withdrawal" [...] was only a concealment of the Infinite Light into <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>God,</b> to allow the latent potentially finite light to emerge after the Tzimtzum. God Himself remains unaffected ("For I, the Lord, I have not changed" [...] Malachi 3:6). His essence was One, alone, before Creation, and still One, alone, after Creation, without any change. As the Tzimtzum was only a concealment, therefore God's Unity is Omnipresent. In the Baal Shem Tov's new interpretation, Divine Providence affects every detail of Creation. The [...] "movement of a leaf in the wind" [...] is part of the unfolding Divine presence, and is a necessary part of the complete Tikkun (Rectification in Kabbalah). This awareness of the loving Divine purpose and significance of each individual, awakens mystical love and awe of God.|$|E

The enemy also would else never let go his objecting against our salvation. But now God has declared that our salvation is grounded on justice, because merited by blood. And though God needed not to have given his Son to die for us that he might save us, and stop the mouth of the devil in so doing, yet this way of salvation has done both, and so it is declared, we are 'justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past--to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.'
