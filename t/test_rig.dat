5|$|By around 1981 in the UK, {{the future}} for Concorde looked bleak. The British {{government}} had lost money operating Concorde every year, and moves were afoot to cancel the service entirely. A cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> for the wings had built up enough data to last for 30 years and could be shut down. Despite this, the government was not keen to continue. In 1983, BA's managing director, Sir John King, convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to the then state-owned British Airways for £16.5million plus the first year's profits. British Airways was subsequently privatized in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Air {{compression}} on {{the outer}} surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch {{by the end of}} the flight. Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the nose, due to aerodynamic heating. The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02. Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling. A <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing. The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDrilling Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics (CFRP) induces {{different}} material defects like delamination, burnt matrix material, {{rough bore}} channel surfaces, fibre pull-out and uncut fibres.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{product of a}} degree project {{accomplishment}} at Linnaeus University in Växjö, Sweden. It is about designing a <b>testing</b> <b>rig</b> for impact loading of beams for laboratory use. The specimens to be used were 1 meter long 8 standard profiles given in the project assignment. The first step in this project was to design and dimension a <b>testing</b> <b>rig</b> which is suitable for laboratory use. The height and the maximum mass were chosen according to laboratory use conditions and safety issues. The second step was designing the fixation for the test sample to the <b>testing</b> <b>rig</b> without any dislocation by the impact load. The third step was to measure the falling height of the mass onto the test sample and measure the deflection of the beam. In this case, the precision of falling height was not very important but measuring the deflection of the beam with the highest possible precision was most important. A measurement system is used considering this factor. The project started {{with the idea of}} affecting the impact loads on the standard steel construction beams. The aim of this project is to design an impact loading <b>testing</b> <b>rig</b> which can be used for the purpose of laboratory experiments and compare the real results from the experiments with the theoretical results from the calculations. In the project, Solid Works and AutoCAD software are often used both in the drawings and strength and stress analyses...|$|R

The design, development {{and set up}} of advanced harvesters characterized by new materials, optimized shape and specific solutions for tuning require the possibility of testing prototypes in the laboratory simulating the actual working conditions and in particular impulsive events.

2500|$|The final, {{and most}} {{commonly}} used type of combustor is the fully annular combustor. [...] Annular combustors {{do away with the}} separate combustion zones and simply have a continuous liner and casing in a ring (the annulus). There are many advantages to annular combustors, including more uniform combustion, shorter size (therefore lighter), and less surface area. Additionally, annular combustors tend to have very uniform exit temperatures. They also have the lowest pressure drop of the three designs (on the order of 5%). The annular design is also simpler, although testing generally requires a full size <b>test</b> <b>rig.</b> An engine that uses an annular combustor is the CFM International CFM56.

Tests were performed by individually varying geometric variables and obtaining corresponding leakage measurements. Dimension variables under investigation were surface roughness, radial clearance, step height, annular groove configuration in stator surface, and annular groove configuration in rotor surface. Results showed that several geometric variables can be used to produce substantial changes in seal leakage resistance. Surface roughness was found to significantly impact seal leakage. Clearance and step height proved to be reliable in improving seal performance. Annular grooves in the stator and rotor surfaces provided additional opportunities to increase labyrinth seal leakage resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to design and test a {{mechanical}} DC torque tool <b>testing</b> <b>rig</b> that is capable of simulating dynamic response of the human arm under a torque impulse. The mechanical simulation of the human arm response is based on a nonlinear model derived from human subject <b>testing.</b> The <b>testing</b> <b>rig,</b> which uses both tension and compression springs to provide a bilinear stiffness rate to resist the motion of the torque tool handle, is used to analyze the tool handle angular displacement and reaction force, which has been strongly linked in previous studies to operator discomfort and injury. The mechanical simulation of the human arm response was tested under a number of different conditions, and compared to an analytical nonlinear model. The results showed that the mechanical simulation consistently underestimated the tool handle displacement by up to 16. 2 % when compared to the nonlinear model predictions. The discrepancy in handle displacement between the nonlinear model and mechanical simulation is likely due the coulomb friction not being included in the nonlinear model.
