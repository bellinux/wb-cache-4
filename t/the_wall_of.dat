5|$|A one-story kitchen addition, {{built in}} 1961–1962 and {{measuring}} about , {{extends from the}} northwest side of the original 1855 house. The addition has a gabled standing seam metal roof, and its exterior is covered in white-painted board-and-batten siding. It has a vinyl bay window on the southwest side, a one-over-one double-hung vinyl window on the northeast side and a door (adjoining <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the 1855 house) on the southeast side. An enclosed board-and-batten porch, measuring about , and a shed roof extend from the front (southwest) of the kitchen addition.

40|$|Occurrence of {{supernumerary}} {{bones in}} <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbit especially in <b>the</b> medial <b>wall</b> and <b>the</b> roof has beendescribed in the literature. Studies of {{the prevalence of}} supernumerary bones in <b>the</b> bony <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbit are scarce in theliterature. Present study was undertaken to find the prevalence of supernumerary bones in <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbit in acollection of adult Indian skulls. In the present study three hundred and twenty six orbital walls from one hundred and sixty three skulls wereexamined {{for the presence of}} the sutural bones. Their location with reference to the sutures in <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbit andtheir size was noted. The supernumerary bones were found in 25 skulls (15. 34 %) mainly in <b>the</b> lateral <b>wall</b> (11. 04 %) and theroof of the orbit (4. 29 %). Prevalence of such supernumerary bones in <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bony orbit is of anthropologicalinterest. Many of the bony ossicles were of sufficiently large size, enough to be visualized on lateral skull X-ray and couldeasily be mistaken for fracture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bony <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbit...|$|R
5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} the plane landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small explosive device consisting of a mix of plastic explosive powder and acid. Abdulmutallab apparently had a packet of the plastic explosive sewn to his underwear, and injected liquid acid from a syringe into the packet to cause a chemical reaction. While {{there was a small}} explosion and fire, the device failed to detonate properly. Passengers heard popping noises resembling firecrackers, smelled an odor, and saw the suspect's pants, leg and <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the plane on fire.|$|E
5|$|According to Islamic belief Muhammad is {{credited}} with setting the Black Stone in the current place in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the Kaaba.

The Black Stone had been temporarily removed to facilitate the rebuilding work. The clans could not agree on which one of them should have the honour of setting the Black Stone back in its place.|$|E
5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera cuts {{to a shot}} of them on the couch, then zooms out to show this as a picture hanging on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> a fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop.

A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and toxic waste, and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E

5|$|Although a cable haulage {{system had}} {{initially}} been considered, Ramsgate Olympia decided {{early in the}} line's planning to electrify the line. A third rail system was rejected due to concerns {{for the safety of}} the large numbers of children expected to use the line, and the locomotives had trolley poles drawing power from a single 400-volt DC overhead line running the length of the tunnel. The wire ran along <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> the old tunnel, on brackets in the roof of the new tunnel, and was supported by poles at the open-air stations. The electricity was supplied by an electrical substation built by English Electric, inside the tunnel near the lower end.|$|E
