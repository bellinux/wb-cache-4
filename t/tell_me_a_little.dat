6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Nathan, [...] "only I {{wish you}} would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> story, as you did last evening. Have not I been still?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can rely}} upon my silence, my lad, and here's half a guinea to drink my health between you. But can't you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{nothing of}} the sort," [...] he answered. [...] "It's your {{rightful}} position. The Fakenham estates have been held by the heir apparent for generations. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about this Miss Delora." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} some day--you won't think me very rude?" [...] asked Barton--"you would mind <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of your history?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{mother has}} been <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{about your family}} affairs," [...] went on Horace Kelsey. [...] "It's a pity you haven't a clear title to this land about here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{affair in}} the north, they <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> seems <b>a</b> <b>little</b> serious," [...] said Greenly. [...] "I {{believe this is}} Mr. Atwood's opinion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Seaforth's {{face grew}} grave. [...] "Is {{there any reason}} why you can't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more? If the man would sooner we did not see it, what did he make the fire for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If it wouldn't be too painful, {{you might}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about your stay in Canada," [...] he said by and by. [...] "You never wrote, and"--he hesitated--"I heard only once from Dick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} {{tell me all}} about it," [...] she remarked. [...] "You have {{something}} on your mind, something which you are half disposed to <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more than half, I think. Go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quest," [...] he pronounced, [...] "you are {{the best}} friend I have in my life! It is you who have rid me of my great burden. <b>Tell</b> me--help <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> with my story--have you read that page from the Medical Journal which Craig has kept locked up all these years?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Oliver, looking unusually grave, {{nodded to}} the boys. [...] "We have just met Jake," [...] he said. [...] "He <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> Tillicum's back <b>a</b> <b>little</b> way up the trail with a broken leg." ...|$|R
3000|$|Other {{information}} included greetings, such as “Good evening,” introductory {{information such}} as “I’m going to explain how a four-stroke engine works,” and meta-comments such as “…let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more about each stage….” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's early yet," [...] Mr. Bundercombe {{declared}} genially. [...] "Let's sit down. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about English business. It interests me. You bought those Chilean bonds all right, I see. They are up {{an eighth}} to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A good deal, off and on. But it's getting chilly and I half {{expect a}} reproving lecture from Miss Hume when I go in. First, though, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{more about the}} young Canadian you had with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With pleasure," [...] he answered; [...] "but first won't you gratify {{a natural}} and very {{specific}} curiosity of mine? I am going to a country which I have never visited before. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about it. Let us talk about America." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{young girl}} made an {{involuntary}} gesture of impatient negation, but checked herself. [...] "Don't let us talk of that now. Come, while I am here under your own roof"--she {{pointed to the}} high interlaced boughs above them--"you must be hospitable. Show <b>me</b> your home; <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> isn't it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gloomy sometimes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have all}} sorts of hot-houses and green-houses," [...] she said, [...] "but they are not very {{interesting}} {{at this time of the}} year, otherwise I would ask you to walk through them before you go." [...] She then went on to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that <b>a</b> <b>little</b> building which she pointed out was a mushroom-house. [...] "And you will think it strange that it should be there when I tell you that not one of our family likes mushrooms or ever tastes one. But the manager thinks that we ought to grow mushrooms, and so we do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Why, only to-day {{he sends}} back his love by Johanna Van der Merwe, {{that goes to}} their doctor for her sick baby's eyes. He sends his love, that Mankeltow, and he <b>tells</b> her <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> he has <b>a</b> <b>little</b> garden of roses all ready {{for me in the}} Dutch Indies--Umballa. He is very funny, my Captain Mankeltow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{will think}} it over by the morning," [...] Graheme said. [...] "And now <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more about the merits of this quarrel in Germany. If I am going to fight, I should like at least {{to know exactly what}} I am {{fighting}} about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What cheer!" [...] {{returned}} Dick. [...] "It was all written, {{and that}} which is written, willy nilly, cometh still to pass. But <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> what manner of a maid ye are, and how ye came into Sir Daniel's hands; that will do better than to bemoan yourself, whether for your sake or mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Louis," [...] said I, [...] "you need {{have no such}} {{fears about}} me. I am a little of an adventurer, a little of a Bohemian. There is no one else who has a claim upon my life, and I do as I please. Can't you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more about this mysterious cafe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was sympathy {{that told}} me," [...] he explained; [...] "and, Aaron, {{if you will}} only believe <b>me,</b> it <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> also that <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of the man you were still clings to you. Come out of the moroseness in which you have enveloped {{yourself}} so long. Think what a joy {{it would be to}} Elspeth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{a way it}} is terrible," [...] she said, with a sigh, [...] "and yet it is so {{much better}} than the things we feared. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> about {{yourself}} <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> won't you? How have you been spending your time? You have a large, gloomy house here, they <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> shrouded with mystery. Have you any amusements or have you been working all the time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I know, dear. And I {{assure you}} I {{appreciate}} your kindness and thoughtfulness {{just as much}} as if it had turned out all right. Now, you mustn't cry any more, but come down with me and show me your flower garden. Miss Cuthbert <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> you have <b>a</b> <b>little</b> plot all your own. I want to see it, for I'm very much interested in flowers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Apropos of frivolity," [...] Rowland said, [...] "I 'm {{sure you}} have very little of it, unless at West Nazareth it is {{considered}} frivolous {{to walk in the}} woods and nod to the nodding flowers. Do kindly <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about yourself." [...] And to compel her to begin, [...] "I know you come of a race of theologians," [...] he went on.|$|E
6000|$|... "You correct me," [...] {{returned}} Barbox Brothers with a blush; [...] "and I {{must look}} so like a Brute, {{that at all}} events it would be superfluous in me to confess to that infirmity. I wish you would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more about yourselves. I hardly knew how to ask it of you, for I am conscious that I have a bad stiff manner, a dull discouraging way with me, but I wish you would." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish, Reuben," [...] he said, {{after a few}} {{remarks on}} other subjects, [...] "that you would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more about yourself. You {{understand}} that I do not ask from mere inquisitiveness; but after what has happened, you see, {{we seem to have}} got into close relationship with each other; and if I knew more about you, I could the easier see in what way I could most really be useful to you, out there. Are you what you appear to be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is much better," [...] remarked Staniford, [...] "than being {{younger than}} you look. I am twenty-eight, and people take me for thirty-four. I'm a prematurely middle-aged man. I wish you would <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> Miss Blood, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about South Bradfield. I've {{been trying to make}} out whether I was ever there. I tramped nearly {{everywhere}} when I was a student. What sort of people are they there?" ...|$|R
60|$|I like Mr. Whiting very much, {{and hence}} would wish him to remain or resign as best suits himself. Hearing this much from me, {{do as you}} think best in the matter. General Lee has sent the Russell letter back, concluding, as I {{understand}} from Grant, that their dignity does not admit of their receiving the document from us. Robert just now <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> there was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> rumpus up the line this morning, ending about where it began.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] said Gussie, [...] "I mean {{ladies and}} gentlemen and, of course, boys, what a {{beautiful}} world this is. A beautiful world, full of happiness on every side. Let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> you <b>a</b> <b>little</b> story. Two Irishmen, Pat and Mike, were walking along Broadway, and one said to the other, 'Begorrah, the race is not always to the swift,' and the other replied, 'Faith and begob, education is a drawing out, not a putting in.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{found him}} {{lying on the}} roof of the Villa Mimosa, just over the room where the meeting was taking place," [...] Hunterleys replied. [...] "They chased him round the grounds and we just got him off in a motor-car, but not before he'd been hit twice. He was just able to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little.</b> The first meeting was quite {{informal}} and very guarded. Douaille was most cautious--he was there only to listen. The second meeting was last night. Grex was in the chair, representing Russia." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whatever {{the truth}} {{may be about}} your methods," [...] she declared, [...] "I rather like them, or else I should not be risking my {{reputation}} in this still prudish city by dining with you alone and without a chaperon. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> about yourself. We have met three times, is it not--once at the Embassy, once at the Palace, and once when you paid me that call. How old are you? Tell me about your people in England, and where else you have served besides Paris?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you will}} be kind enough to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more about it, Mr. Strelinski," [...] Julian said, turning to the Pole, {{and in spite of}} a growl from Frank that there was nothing to tell, the Pole related the whole {{circumstances}} of the quarrel, the feeling that had been excited by it, Frank's expressed determination not to inflict serious injury upon the man but to carry away his trigger-finger only, and so put an end to his duels in the future, {{and the manner in which}} his intention was carried out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you repeat}} to your sister {{when she is}} recovered, what I have been <b>telling</b> you?--Let <b>me</b> be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{lightened}} too in her opinion {{as well as in}} yours. You <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that she has forgiven me already. Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my present feelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more gentle, less dignified, forgiveness. Tell her of my misery and my penitence--tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her, and if you will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "While we {{were keeping}} company {{together}} he told <b>me</b> he was <b>an</b> orphan--with an uncle and aunt in Canada, and an only brother settled in Scotland. Before {{we were married}} he gave <b>me</b> <b>a</b> letter from this brother. It was {{to say that he}} was sorry he was not able to come to England, and be present at my marriage, and to wish me joy and the rest of it. Good Mr. Bapchild (to whom, in my distress, I wrote word privately of what had happened) wrote back in return, <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> to wait <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> and see whether my husband did it again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ladies," [...] said Mrs. Faulkner, [...] "of course, we can't all {{stay here}} and wait for that woman; but I propose that three of us shall stay and that the rest shall go home. I'll be one to stay. And then, in an hour three of you come back, and let us go and get our suppers. In this way we can keep a {{committee}} here all the time. All night, if necessary. When I come back I will bring a candlestick and some candles, for, of course, we don't want to light her lamps. If she should come down while I am away, I'd like some one to run over and <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> It's such <b>a</b> <b>little</b> way." ...|$|R
