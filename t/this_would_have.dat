5|$|According to Christian theologian Gordon J. Wenham, {{the purpose}} of kashrut was to help Jews {{maintain}} a distinct and separate existence from other peoples; {{he says that the}} effect of the laws was to prevent socialization and intermarriage with non-Jews, preventing Jewish identity from being diluted. Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews.|$|E

5|$|At 23:30, Fleet and Lee {{noticed a}} slight haze {{on the horizon}} ahead of them, but did not make {{anything}} of it.

5|$|From {{the sixth}} century, Scotland {{experienced}} {{a process of}} Christianisation, traditionally seen as carried out by Irish-Scots missionaries, including St Ninian, St Kentigern and St Columba {{and to a lesser}} extent those from Rome and England. However, Gilbert Markus highlights the fact that most of these figures were not church-founders, but were usually were active in areas where Christianity had already become established, probably through gradual diffusion that is almost invisible in the historical record. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> included trade, conquest and intermarriage.|$|E
5|$|Had Napoleon {{succeeded in}} {{destroying}} the existing coalition forces south of Brussels {{before they were}} reinforced, {{he might have been}} able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war.

5|$|In 1861 a {{proposal}} {{was made to}} construct a road from Blackfriars to the Mansion House; <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> resulted in the complete demolition of the College. However, protests from the heralds resulted in only parts of the south east and south west wings being sliced off, requiring extensive remodelling. The College was now a three-sided building with an open courtyard facing the New Queen Victoria Street laid out in 1866. The terrace, steps and entrance porch were also added around this time.|$|E

5|$|In June 1985, {{three months}} after the miners {{admitted}} defeat and ended their strike, Benn introduced the Miners' Amnesty (General Pardon) Bill into the Commons, which would have extended an amnesty to all miners imprisoned during the strike. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> included two men convicted of murder (later reduced to manslaughter) for the killing of David Wilkie, a taxi driver driving a non-striking miner to work in South Wales during the strike.|$|E

5|$|Initially, diesel {{propulsion}} {{was planned}} for these ships, {{as had been}} used for the three Panzerschiffe. However, {{it was decided to}} use superheated steam propulsion. The main reason was that the required total output for the desired speed was three times that of the Panzerschiffe. In the case of triple-screw ships, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> meant more than twice the shaft horsepower per shaft of the Panzerschiffe, {{and in the case of}} a quadruple-screw ship, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> amounted to more than 40,000 horsepower per shaft. This requirement was beyond the diesel technology then available, and devising engines that could meet this demand would take an unforeseeable amount of time. Since high-pressure superheated steam had already proved successful, it was considered the most suitable choice for high power machinery.|$|E

5|$|Others {{have argued}} that the {{cemetery}} represents a fusion of Christian and pagan Saxon customs. It was not {{until the end of the}} 7th century that the practice of burying people in consecrated ground around a church became the norm. There are examples of known Christians being buried in an ostensibly pagan fashion, as was the case for the late 7th century Kentish princess Eormengyth, sister of the abbess of Minster-in-Thanet. She was buried in a traditional tumulus a mile east of her sister's minster. John Blair argues that the Church in early Saxon England may have tolerated Christians being given pagan burial rites due to the 'Christianising' effect <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had on a pagan site. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been consistent with the advice given by Pope Gregory the Great in 601 that Saxon shrines should be converted to Christian use, rather than being destroyed, and that pagan festivals and rites should be converted into Christian ones. On this interpretation, the cemetery may symbolise the continuity between the pagan past and the increasingly Christianised present.|$|E
