5|$|In November 2006, Woods {{announced}} {{his intention to}} begin designing golf courses around the world through a new company, <b>Tiger</b> <b>Woods</b> Design. A month later, he announced that the company's first course would be in Dubai {{as part of a}} 25.3 million-square-foot development, The <b>Tiger</b> <b>Woods</b> Dubai. The Al Ruwaya Golf Course was initially expected to finish construction in 2009. As of February 2010, only seven holes had been completed; in April 2011, The New York Times reported that the project had been shelved permanently. In 2013, the partnership between <b>Tiger</b> <b>Woods</b> Design and Dubai Holding was dissolved.|$|E

5000|$|Wood had a brief, but memorable, stint {{with the}} Canton Bulldogs. He played {{in just one}} game for team in 1906, but the game was for the [...] "Ohio League" [...] {{championship}} and was fought against Canton's rivial, the Massillon <b>Tigers.</b> <b>Wood</b> was hired by Bulldogs coach, Blondy Wallace, {{to play in the}} game after a player named [...] "Gilchrist" [...] became injured. The game resulted in a 13-6 Canton loss and the events following the game later became known as the Canton Bulldogs-Massillon <b>Tigers</b> betting scandal. <b>Wood</b> was hinted as being persuaded by Wallace to throw the game for a profit in a, historically dismissed, 1934 book by Dr. Harry March entitled, Pro Football: Its Ups and Downs.|$|R
5|$|Woods also {{endorsed}} the <b>Tiger</b> <b>Woods</b> PGA Tour series of video games; {{he has done}} so since 1999. In 2006, he signed a six-year contract with Electronic Arts, the series' publisher.|$|E

50|$|In 2013, Woods {{made his}} State of Origin debut in game two after James Tamou was {{suspended}} for a drink-driving offence. He also played in the third game of the series, but saw limited time on the field in both matches. Playing for the Wests <b>Tigers,</b> <b>Woods</b> was averaging a high 60 minutes per game in an inexperienced front row, before succumbing to injury late in the season. Woods later signed a contract to remain with the Wests Tigers for a further three seasons.|$|R

40|$|Aposematic organisms avoid {{predation}} by advertising defences with warning signals. The {{theory of}} aposematism predicts warning signal uniformity, yet variation in warning coloration is widespread. The chemically defended <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth Arctia plantaginis shows both geographic variation and local polymorphism in warning coloration. In this thesis, I studied whether predation by local avian predators {{is driving the}} evolution of <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth warning colours. The close relatives of the <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth designated here to genus Arctia do not show similar colour polymorphism. The <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth is thus apparently under evolutionary radiation and provides a natural laboratory for observing current selection and studying the mechanisms leading to population divergence. We found evidence of positive frequency-dependent selection as predicted by aposematic theory, but the direction and strength of selection varied geographically. Variation in predator behaviour and the quality and abundance of alternative prey affected selection on <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth warning colour. Experiments with wild-caught blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tits (Parus major) indicate, that colour is of foremost importance in prey discrimination and avoidance generalization. Birds did not generalize their learned avoidance among morphs, but could generalize between vaguely similar prey species showing similar warning colours. I conclude, that a) the evolution of <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth warning coloration is driven by predation of local avian predators, b) the direction of selection is affected by variation in predator and prey qualities at different levels (from individuals to communities), which {{can contribute to the}} maintenance of polymorphism, and that c) the strength of selection can vary spatially and temporally, and be counterbalanced or overruled by other evolutionary processes, promoting variation in warning colour...|$|R
5|$|In 1952 the Masters began {{presenting}} an award, {{known as}} the Silver Cup, to the lowest-scoring amateur to make the cut. In 1954 they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up. There have been six players to win low amateur {{and then go on}} to win the Masters as a professional. These players are Cary Middlecoff, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Crenshaw, Phil Mickelson, <b>Tiger</b> <b>Woods</b> and Sergio García.|$|E
5|$|Nicklaus has {{the most}} Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. Palmer and <b>Tiger</b> <b>Woods</b> won four each, and five have won three titles at Augusta: Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Nick Faldo, and Phil Mickelson.

40|$|Warning (aposematic) and cryptic colorations {{appear to}} be {{mutually}} incompat-ible because the primary function of the former is to increase detectability, whereas {{the function of the}} latter is to decrease it. Disruptive coloration is a type of crypsis in which the color pattern breaks up the outline of the prey, thus hindering its detection. This delusion can work even when the prey’s pat-tern elements are highly contrasting; thus, it is possible for an animal’s col-oration to combine both warning and disruptive functions. The coloration of the <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moth (Parasemia plantaginis) is such that the moth is conspicu-ous when it rests on vegetation, but when it feigns death and drops to the grass- and litter-covered ground, it is hard to detect. This death-feigning behav-ior therefore immediately switches the function of its coloration from signaling to camouflage. We experimentally tested whether the forewing patterning of <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moths could function as disruptive coloration against certain back-grounds. Using actual forewing patterns of <b>wood</b> <b>tiger</b> moths, we crafted artifi...|$|R

40|$|Notational {{analysis}} of golf involves using either outcome measures, namely scores (hole and round) or process measures {{which can be}} independent (e. g. driving distance) or composite (e. g. greens in regulation) elements of the game. Research {{suggests that there is}} a relatively large variation in round scores for successive rounds although this paper shows the way in which this finding is interpreted is related to the data sample used. This paper re-analyses previous data to suggest that the most consistent finding is that a bad score on one hole increases the likelihood of a bad score on the subsequent hole irrespective of the standard of the player. Greens in regulation (GIR) along with putting leaders (putts per GIR) have consistently been shown to be the best indicators of overall scoring with driving distance and driving accuracy the others of significance. Here a form chart was used to show how inaccurate these variables (with scrambling added) were as predictors of <b>Tiger</b> <b>Wood's</b> scoring performance during the years 2000 and 2007. It was hence argued that it is only independent elements of the game that need to be analysed to determine the true worth of the different elements e. g. putting, approach shots and driving measures, to scoring ability. It is further argued here, that performance improvement in each element of the game {{may be related to the}} availability of relevant performance measures for that element...|$|R
