25|$|The Z-class trams, {{built by}} Comeng, were {{introduced}} in 1975, starting with the Z1-class. 100 Z1-class trams were built between 1975 and 1979. The design was unpopular due to {{the limited number of}} doors and the position of the conductor's seat. Most of the Z1-class trams were withdrawn following the introduction of the C, D and E class trams; the last Z1-class withdrawn on 23 April 2016. Many were later sold at auctions, while others were donated <b>to</b> <b>tram</b> museums.|$|E
25|$|Other {{proposals}} have been aborted. During 2014 and 2015 STIB/MIVB promoted {{a project to}} convert the Porte de Namur/Naamsepoort to Delta section of the overloaded 71 bus route <b>to</b> <b>tram</b> operation. The Brussels region supported the proposal, but the municipality of Ixelles/Elsene was against, supported by traders on the Chaussée dÍxelles/Elsensesteenweg who feared the disruption the tracklaying would cause. The proposal was dropped and instead the section as far as Place Fernand Coq/Fernand Coqplein is to be made largely car-free.|$|E
25|$|Private motorcars were {{starting}} to become {{more common in the}} 1920s, but were initially more of a danger <b>to</b> <b>tram</b> passengers than to the business of the Board. As many tramlines ran down the middle of a road, it was common to hail a tram by walking out into the road, which became more dangerous with the faster moving motorcars. Also, traffic behind a tram that had stopped to allow for the embarkation or disembarkation of passengers was only able to pass between the tram and curb, right into the path of passengers moving between the tram and footpath.|$|E

25|$|The Carrington service had, as its competitor, a horse {{bus service}} {{operated}} by Messrs Andrews of Carrington. When this firm went bankrupt, in 1888, the Tramway Company bought {{four of their}} horse buses and converted them <b>to</b> <b>tram</b> cars. In 1891 two of the converted buses were scrapped, as was car No.19, which was an 1881 Starbuck single deck design, converted to double deck in 1885. The other two converted horse buses were renumbered, and four further new cars were obtained. From G.F. Milnes & Co., two double-deckers were purchased, and two of toast rack design came from an unknown maker. It is possible that those two toast rack vehicles were built at Nottingham in the company’s own works.|$|E
25|$|Following Dadford's demise, Benjamin Outram was {{consulted}} on {{a number}} of matters, and recommended that the railways should be converted from edge rails <b>to</b> <b>tram</b> plates. Many of them were converted in this way, but this alteration was not always successful, with users of the Crumlin Bridge to Beaufort Ironworks tramway complaining in 1802 that they had incurred considerable cost to make the transition, only to find that the new tramway was unusable due to poor construction. In 1806, the loaded weights of wagons were reduced, in an attempt {{to reduce the number of}} broken tramplates. Ultimately, many of the tramways were converted to standard gauge railways, and so reverted to the flanged wheel system.|$|E
25|$|Signals, however, {{are used}} to give {{indications}} <b>to</b> <b>tram</b> drivers when running on-street and at street crossings. As trams have priority at many places, {{it was necessary to}} give them different traffic light phases from motor traffic and therefore different types of indication have to be used from those applicable to motor vehicles. Signal phases for the tramway are specifically modified to account for the length of the tram. The tram signals are usually operated alongside and in conjunction with traffic signals. Signals consist of white lights arranged vertically (for go), horizontally (for stop) and a cross (for caution). Two other light arrangement indicate a point direction at junctions. The five white lights are distinct from those of the standard road traffic lights or railway line-side signals.|$|E

25|$|During the First World War Richardson, in his {{position}} as Chief Constable, issued instructions about introducing, the Keep Left Rule, Traffic Signals and the Police Identity Parade. All motor and horse drawn traffic must drive on the Left hand side of the road. This was mandatory and not optional. Coloured lights at busy road junctions were introduced into Halifax, {{being one of the}} first Boroughs to do so. There were two lights for each road, one red for Danger (red as it was considered to be the best colour to penetrate fog and haze) and green for Go. These two colours were used by the railways and instantly recognizable by the population. They were attached <b>to</b> <b>tram</b> poles and hand operated by a Constable. This is thought to be possibly one of the first uses of traffic lights in the country. London had used semaphore signals, the first sited at Charing Cross, but they were never considered to be effective.|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, {{the company}} {{introduced}} an early running alarm system for drivers, which is linked into the automatic vehicle tracking system, and sounds an alarm and displays warning messages if {{the bus is}} running early. This was {{as a result of}} the company being fined £10,500 by the Traffic Commissioner for Scotland, having been found to be running buses early. After a customer complaint, Vehicle and Operator Services Agency monitored services 4, 16, 27 and 45 in February 2010, and found that of 303 instances, 44 buses were running early, despite starting the route on time, while 20 were running late. The company's defence was that they had built in some running time to cope with the delays due <b>to</b> <b>tram</b> works, but in some places, these works had ended early. The Commissioner accepted this defence, and chose not to take action against the company's operating licence (which authorises a maximum of 700 vehicles). Instead the Commissioner imposed a fine set much lower than the legal maximum (calculated as £550 * 700 vehicles = £385,000) ...|$|E
2500|$|In the old days, the {{duration}} of meal breaks allocated <b>to</b> <b>tram</b> drivers were far from adequate. Most drivers would therefore {{take advantage of the}} time their trams are waiting at a red light to gulp down a portion of their meal before the signal turns to green, continuing this practice whenever the tram comes to a red light until the meal is finished. This kind of hurried, impromptu meal is commonly referred as [...] "red light meals" [...] (...) [...]|$|E

2500|$|The {{standard}} {{ticket is}} ticket [...] "t+". It is valid for a multi-transfer journey within {{one and a}} half hours from the first validation. It can be used on the Métro, buses and trams, and in zone 1 of the RER. It allows unlimited transfers between the same mode of transport (i.e. Métro to Métro, bus to bus and tram <b>to</b> <b>tram),</b> between bus and tram, and between metro and RER zone 1. When transferring between the Metro and the RER, it is necessary to retain the ticket. The RER requires a valid ticket for entry and exit, even for a transfer. It costs €1.90 or ten (a carnet) for €14.50 as of June 2017.|$|E
2500|$|Electrification {{started in}} 1898, {{and most of}} the system was {{converted}} by 1910. An exception was the privately owned Parramatta line built by Charles Edward Jeanneret in 1881 to Redbank Wharf (Duck River) where the steam tram remained until 1943. Service began with C-class saloon cars, followed by D-class combination cars. In contrast to other cities that started with combination cars and toastracks, then quickly abandoned them for drop-centre and saloon cars, Sydney started by going the other way. Footboard trams continued to be introduced, notably E-class, K-class, and the double-bogie cars O-class and P-class trams required the conductor to collect fares from the footboard of the car, as those trams had no corridor. Revered though those trams were, they were deathtraps for conductors. On average, each day one conductor fell or was knocked off the footboard by passing motor vehicles. The majority suffered a fractured skull. In the three years 1923, 1924, 1925, there were 282, 289, and 233 accidents respectively to conductors on NSW tramways. From 1916 to 1932, there were 4,097 accidents <b>to</b> <b>tram</b> employees, and from 1923 to 1931 there were 10,228 accidents to passengers having falls when alighting or boarding. [...] 63 of the falls were fatal. [...] Of the more than 100 falls reported of conductors, one quarter died from their injuries. [...] It was not until the 1930s with the introduction of the R-class that the drop-centre saloon tram, widely used elsewhere in Australia, came to Sydney. Even so, footboard trams continued in wide use until the late 1950s, despite calls as early as 1934 by the tram union for them to be modified.|$|E
2500|$|Richardson {{introduced}} the Police Telephone System throughout the Borough during the First World War. They were attached <b>to</b> <b>tram</b> line poles {{and for the}} first time Constables on the Beat could contact Harrison Rd. H.Q. Telephone boxes were introduced in 1925 and pillar type telephone boxes (soon to go nationwide) which could be used by the public in emergencies. These were used in Halifax until 1967. An article headed Police Signals. records that" [...] Lt. Col. Sir Hugh Turnbill, Commissioner of the London City Police, is making full use of electrical devices in connection with his force. He is experimenting with a signaling system in connection with the present ambulance alarm posts. The Journal remarks: Halifax was one of the first towns to introduce this system. When will these who follow the doings of Halifax, as we have wondered before, give Halifax and its Chief Constable the credit that is due in them, and acknowledge Halifax as the very first town to adopt these street signals for the purpose of communicating from headquarters with men on the various beats. There are 24 such lights in operation in Halifax now and the system has been in use for over 20years. It has been a great boon. For instance, before it was introduced, if headquarters wished to pass any kind of information on to the man on duty in the streets it could only be done by messenger, a waste of time and a very cumbrous method compared with that in existence today." [...] However, it was not until 1937 that London saw [...] telephones that were erected in Pillars in quantity. Soon, their use was extended to the public.|$|E
