Proactiv+, a reformulation of the three-step kit, was introduced in 2013.|$|E
5000|$|In photography, gold <b>toners</b> {{are used}} to shift the color of silver bromide {{black-and-white}} prints towards brown or blue tones, or to increase their stability. Used on sepia-toned prints, gold <b>toners</b> produce red tones. Kodak published formulas for several types of gold <b>toners,</b> which use gold as the chloride.|$|R

5|$|Duke {{consistently}} {{ranks among}} the top in the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA) Directors' Cup, an overall measure of an institution's athletic success. For Division I in 2015, Duke finished 20th overall and fifth in the ACC. The Blue Devils have finished within the top 10 six times {{since the inception of}} the Cup in 1993–94. Also, Athletic Director Kevin White earned multiple awards in 2014, including the National Football Foundation's John L. <b>Toner</b> Award and the Sport Business Journal Athletic Director of the Year award.|$|E
5|$|The <b>toner</b> {{contains}} glycolic acid, an exfoliant, and witch hazel, an astringent. The {{active ingredient}} in the cleanser and lotion, outside Europe, is a 2.5 percent concentration of benzoyl peroxide, lower than in most prescription-strength acne treatments. Benzoyl peroxide has been used since 1934 to kill Propionibacterium acnes, the bacterium that causes acne. Several over-the-counter acne treatments contain it, including Clean & Clear, Clearasil, Doctor's Dermatologic Formula, Neutrogena Advanced Systems, PanOxyl and Stridex.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{black is}} used as the black pigment in {{printing}} ink, artist's oil paint and water colours, carbon paper, automotive finishes, India ink and laser printer <b>toner.</b> Carbon black is also used as a filler in rubber products such as tyres and in plastic compounds. Activated charcoal {{is used as}} an absorbent and adsorbent in filter material in applications as diverse as gas masks, water purification, and kitchen extractor hoods, and in medicine to absorb toxins, poisons, or gases from the digestive system. Carbon is used in chemical reduction at high temperatures. Coke is used to reduce iron ore into iron (smelting). Case hardening of steel is achieved by heating finished steel components in carbon powder. Carbides of silicon, tungsten, boron and titanium, are among the hardest known materials, and are used as abrasives in cutting and grinding tools. Carbon compounds make {{up most of the}} materials used in clothing, such as natural and synthetic textiles and leather, and almost all of the interior surfaces in the built environment other than glass, stone and metal.|$|E

25|$|The Ink or <b>Toner</b> {{does not}} absorb into the substrate, as does {{conventional}} ink, but forms a layer {{on the surface}} and may be fused to the substrate by using an inline fuser fluid with heat process (<b>toner)</b> or UV curing process (ink).|$|E
25|$|Printer ink {{cartridges}} can be reused. They are sorted by brand and model, to be refilled or resold {{back to the}} manufacturers. The companies then refill the ink reservoir to resell to consumers. <b>Toner</b> cartridges are recycled {{the same way as}} {{ink cartridges}}, using <b>toner</b> instead of ink. This method is highly efficient as there is no energy spent on melting and recreating the cartridges.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study to assess the {{potential}} of measurements of magnetism, using a proprietary magnetic analysis system, for the routine analysis of <b>toners</b> on documents printed by black and white elec- trophotographic systems. Magnetic properties of black <b>toners</b> on documents printed {{by a number of}} different devices were measured and compared. Our results indicate that the analysis of magnetism is complementary to traditional methods for analysing black <b>toners,</b> such as FTIR. Further, we find that the analysis of mag- netism is realistically applicable in closed set cases, that is when the number of potential printing devices can be clearly defined...|$|R

25|$|Professional digital {{printing}} (using <b>toner)</b> primarily uses an electrical charge to transfer <b>toner</b> or liquid ink to the substrate onto {{which it is}} printed. Digital print quality has steadily improved from early color and black and white copiers to sophisticated colour digital presses such as the Xerox iGen3, the Kodak Nexpress, the HP Indigo Digital Press series, and the InfoPrint 5000. The iGen3 and Nexpress use <b>toner</b> particles and the Indigo uses liquid ink. The InfoPrint 5000 is a full-color, continuous forms inkjet drop-on-demand printing system. All handle variable data, and rival offset in quality. Digital offset presses are also called direct imaging presses, although these presses can receive computer files and automatically turn them into print-ready plates, they cannot insert variable data.|$|E
