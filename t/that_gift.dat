5|$|In 1918, Halifax sent a Christmas tree to the City of Boston in {{thanks and}} remembrance {{for the help}} that the Boston Red Cross and the Massachusetts Public Safety Committee {{provided}} immediately after the disaster. <b>That</b> <b>gift</b> was revived in 1971 by the Lunenburg County Christmas Tree Producers Association, which began an annual donation of a large tree to promote Christmas tree exports as well as acknowledge Boston's support after the explosion. The gift was later {{taken over by the}} Nova Scotia Government to continue the goodwill gesture as well as to promote trade and tourism. The tree is Boston's official Christmas tree and is lit on Boston Common throughout the holiday season. In deference to its symbolic importance for both cities, the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources has specific guidelines for selecting the tree.|$|E
5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli {{it was a matter}} of attacking a doctrine that imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther {{it was a matter of}} defending a doctrine that embodied <b>that</b> <b>gift.</b> It is not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology was before he became a reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns the sacrifice of the mass, he states that it is a memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds on this in An Exposition of the Articles (1523).|$|E
25|$|On 15 August 1942 (feast of Santa Maria) {{a convoy}} of Royal and Merchant Navy ships made port at Valletta's Grand Harbour, after {{completing}} {{one of the most}} heroic maritime episodes in recent history. To-date, this event remains commemorated in Malta in remembrance of <b>that</b> <b>gift</b> from heaven, the Convoy of Santa Maria, and all the men who lived and died in this and previous attempts to bring supplies to Malta.|$|E
5000|$|The Law of Use: Shinn {{explains}} <b>that</b> a <b>gift</b> is {{a better}} investment than a savings account. [...] "Many people are in ignorance of the fact <b>that</b> <b>gifts</b> and things are investments, and that hoarding and saving invariably lead to loss." ...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the argument <b>that</b> <b>gifts</b> in kind often {{do not meet the}} needs of recipients, it has also been argued <b>that</b> <b>gifts</b> in kind fail to empower the recipients because the recipients don't have as much flexibility on how to spend the gifts as they would with gifts of cash or of public goods that they actively solicit. Relatedly, it has been argued <b>that</b> sending <b>gifts</b> in kind without checking on what the recipients may actually need may be disrespectful to the recipients, and in some cases self-centered and narcissistic, being focused on the needs of the donor rather than the recipient.|$|R
25|$|In 1987, {{the tenth}} {{dean of the}} school, Raymond Miles, began the school's first major capital {{campaign}} {{to raise money for}} a new building. Major contributions were made by Wells Fargo and Eugene Trefethen, an executive with Kaiser Industries. In 1989, the Walter and Elise Haas Fund donated $23.75million to the building campaign. The donation was the largest {{in the history of the}} university to that date. The school was renamed the Haas School of Business in honor of <b>that</b> <b>gift.</b>|$|E
25|$|I {{know there}} are some who {{disagree}} and I respect their point of view but I believe that life begins at conception. The only exception I have to have an abortion is in that case {{of the life of the}} mother. I just struggled with it myself for a long time but I came to realize: Life is <b>that</b> <b>gift</b> from God that I think even if life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, the Perls further donated 13 {{works by}} Picasso, Amedeo Modigliani, Georges Braque, Fernand Léger, Soutine and Pascin to the Metropolitan. <b>That</b> <b>gift</b> {{was one of}} the largest ever {{received}} by the Metropolitan’s department of 20th-century art and greatly helped round out the museum’s collection. Two were from 1910, Picasso’s Nude in an Armchair and Braque’s oval Candlestick and Playing Cards on a Table, and the third was Picasso’s Still Life With Pipes from 1912. The gift also included several Picassos from the 1930s, notably Sleeping Nude With Flowers and Girl Asleep at a Table. Klaus Perls was subsequently named honorary trustee of the Metropolitan Museum. The Perls Foundation was set up after the Perls Gallery closed in 1997.|$|E

50|$|Helping {{with longer}} term {{development}} in impoverished or otherwise distressed areas {{is a high}} priority for governments and large NGOs. It is argued <b>that</b> <b>gifts</b> in kind can be a significant component of a larger humanitarian development strategy.|$|R

500|$|PedroII {{became a}} member of the Royal Society, the Russian Academy of Sciences, The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium and the American Geographical Society. In 1875, he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences, an honor {{previously}} granted to only two other heads of state: Peter the Great and Napoleon Bonaparte. He exchanged letters with scientists, philosophers, musicians and other intellectuals. Many of his correspondents became his friends, including Richard Wagner, Louis Pasteur, Louis Agassiz, John Greenleaf Whittier, Michel Eugène Chevreul, Alexander Graham Bell, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Arthur de Gobineau, Frédéric Mistral, Alessandro Manzoni, Alexandre Herculano, Camilo Castelo Branco and James Cooley Fletcher. His erudition amazed Friedrich Nietzsche when the two met. Victor Hugo told the Emperor: [...] "Sire, you are a great citizen, you are the grandson of Marcus Aurelius," [...] and Alexandre Herculano called him a [...] "Prince whom the general opinion holds as the foremost of his era because of his gifted mind, and due to the constant application of <b>that</b> <b>gift</b> to the sciences and culture." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not {{everyone}} agreed about {{the greatness of}} <b>that</b> <b>gift.</b> For the conductor Otto Klemperer he was [...] "without doubt the only man of his generation who is an outstanding conductor and musician." [...] For the critic Hans Keller he was [...] "incapable of phrasing. It's {{as simple as that}} ... That's why he conducts Bach, Beethoven or Webern in exactly the same way." [...] His biographer Joan Peyser considered that [...] "in general Boulez conducts what he loves magnificently, conducts what he likes very well and, with rare exceptions, gives stiff performances of the classic and romantic repertoire." ...|$|E
2500|$|The rivers {{were the}} domains of potamides {{as well as of}} the nymphs Fluviales. Every creek had its potamide, who as local divinities, and like all the naiads, were daughters of the gods of rivers, also called Potamoi deities. Even the rivers of the marshy regions are {{described}} as having their nymphs; hence no exception was made to the waters of Greek underworld ruled by god Hades, as was quoted in Latin: [...] "Nymphae infernae paludis and Avernales", which means [...] "swampy Avernales, the infernal nymphs". And many of these hellish potamides, the Avernales, were believed to be owners of prophetic ability, and to express <b>that</b> <b>gift</b> to their chosen men.|$|E

50|$|A survey {{conducted}} in November 2005 by American Express found <b>that</b> experiential <b>gift</b> giving {{was on the}} rise: 30% of those surveyed planned on giving experiential <b>gifts</b> <b>that</b> year versus 23% the prior year. The survey also found <b>that</b> experiential <b>gifts</b> were particularly popular among consumers aged 18-44. A survey published in 2007 by Mintel estimated the UK gift experience market to be worth £98 million.|$|R
40|$|Incorporating philanthropy into tourism, through {{practices}} such as volunteer tourism and non-governmental organization (NGO) work, is becoming an increasingly popular way for tourists to aid people of developing nations socially and economically. The roles and impacts of tourist philanthropy on developing nations have been discussed in the literature but one form of tourist philanthropy has, thus far, been missed. Philanthropic <b>gifting,</b> <b>that</b> is the bringing of gifts by tourists to give to local people of developing nations, {{has not yet been}} examined and its impacts have not been discussed in the literature. This study examines the knowledge and prevalence of philanthropic gifting among tourists and travel agents and analyzes the possible implications of philanthropic gifting on the economies of developing nations. These objectives are addressed through a mixed-methods research approach and a case study of two tourism areas in Cuba, Guardalavaca and Varadero. 	The findings of this study demonstrated <b>that</b> philanthropic <b>gifting</b> is prevalent in Cuba and that the knowledge of it among tourists is widespread. Motivation for participating in philanthropic gifting related to the fact that Cuba is a poor nation with strained ties with the United States of America in regards to trade and access to goods. Further research revealed <b>that,</b> though philanthropic <b>gifting</b> was prevalent, gifts were not distributed equally among groups of Cuban people in society, with people working within the tourism industry receiving the large majority of gifts. The main conclusion of this study is <b>that</b> <b>gifting</b> is likely a great source of economic assistance for Cuban people who receive gifts. The economic independence that could be created through receiving gifts is greatly benefitting these Cuban people. The fact <b>that</b> <b>gifts</b> are not equally allocated throughout Cuban society, however, suggests <b>that</b> philanthropic <b>gifting</b> is strengthening the divide between workers of the tourism industry and those outside of it. A greater effort should be made to ensure <b>that</b> <b>gifts</b> reach a greater number of Cubans so that the benefits of philanthropic gifting can be more widespread...|$|R

BCAM's inaugural exhibition featured 176 works by 28 artists of postwar Modern art from the late 1950s to the present. All but 30 of the works initially displayed came {{from the collection of}} Eli and Edythe Broad (pronounced [...] "brode"). Long-time trustee Robert Halff had already donated 53 works of contemporary art in 1994. Components of <b>that</b> <b>gift</b> included Joan Miró, Jasper Johns, Sam Francis, Frank Stella, John Chamberlain, Matthew Barney, and Jeff Koons. It also provided LACMA with its first drawings by Claes Oldenburg and Cy Twombly.|$|E

The MDC suspected the security forces of responsibility for this killing, and the party said that its total number of dead during the violence had reached 113. Chamisa said on 13 July that no agreement had been reached and that the two sides [...] "still have to clear the course for meaningful talks". According to Chamisa, violence against MDC members and supporters was continuing, and he said that it was [...] "difficult to engage in meaningful dialogue" [...] under the circumstances. Zimbabwe's Sunday Mail, however, reported {{on the same day that}} an agreement had been reached on a [...] "working framework" [...] for talks.|$|E

5000|$|Drawing on Marshall Sahlins, Pierre Bourdieu {{reminds us}} <b>that</b> <b>gifting</b> morphs with social {{distance}}: as social distance increases, self-interest and calculation increases {{and the importance}} of generosity and equity declines… the logic of warfare enters even as people look for ways to mediate the distance by “striving to substitute a personal relationship for an impersonal, anonymous one”. Yet, while the capacity to calculate is universal the spirit of calculation (the presumed rationality of the economic actor) is culturally and historically contingent: the [...] "economic habitus" [...] of an actor is learned. Understanding <b>that</b> <b>gifts</b> move in and out of overlapping economic systems and that {{the manner in which they}} move may be impacted by social and physical space, is useful in analyzing the transnational and market-based relations in which remittances are generated, transferred, and spent.|$|R

50|$|The belief <b>that</b> spiritual <b>gifts</b> {{exist in}} the present age is called continuationism by some theologians and {{religious}} studies scholars.
