The shielding allows for a wide field of view {{while at the same}} time protecting against firebombs and rock-throwing.|$|E

The western headwalls of both platform tunnels were rebuilt <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> step plate junction to be installed, providing access from the eastbound and westbound tunnels to a new siding located between Down Street and Hyde Park Corner. The siding is mainly used to reverse westbound trains, but {{could also be used}} for servicing trains. The siding tunnel is accessible at its western end through a small foot tunnel constructed from Hyde Park Corner station. The lifts were removed and the shafts adapted to provide additional tunnel ventilation.|$|E

In 1858, French pediatrician Eugène Bouchut (1818–1891) developed a new technique for non-surgical orotracheal intubation to bypass laryngeal obstruction resulting from a diphtheria-related pseudomembrane. In 1880, Scottish surgeon William Macewen (1848–1924) reported on his use of orotracheal intubation as an alternative to tracheotomy <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> patient with glottic edema to breathe, {{as well as in the}} setting of general anesthesia with chloroform. In 1895, Alfred Kirstein (1863–1922) of Berlin first described direct visualization of the vocal cords, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an autoscope.|$|E
