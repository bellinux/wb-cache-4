5|$|The {{real issue}} is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that is loaded with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E

And I think therefore taking all those circumstances in view... I think it is quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. I think it is a lovely thought and I think it is something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> something one just cannot know.|$|E

Roosevelt herself was sharply discouraged by a 1940 visit {{in which she}} felt the town had become excessively dependent on outside assistance. However, the residents considered the town a [...] "utopia" [...] compared to their previous circumstances, and many were returned to economic self-sufficiency. Roosevelt personally considered the project a success, later speaking of the improvements she saw in people's lives there and stating, [...] "I don't know whether you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> worth half a million dollars.

500|$|When Blair {{left office}} in 2007, it was {{reported}} that his successor as Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, was also being lined up to guest star on the show. Animator Dan Povenmire noted that American audiences would probably require subtitles to understand what Brown was saying. Voice actress Yeardley Smith noted that she would like Brown to appear in The Simpsons, but Brown ruled a guest role out stating: [...] "I think Tony Blair did that, I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> for me". Series creator Matt Groening confirmed that Brown would not be approached for a part.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, he {{was opposed}} by Republican Ronald A. Crews, an evangelical pastor, former Georgia state legislator, and {{president}} of the Massachusetts Family Institute. Crews, a national conservative activist, challenged McGovern's positions on same-sex marriage and abortion. McGovern derided his opponent's focus on social issues, saying, [...] "When Ron Crews gets up in the morning, the first thing he thinks about is gay marriage. I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the most important issue for most families. Jobs, health care, education, how {{to make the world a}} more peaceful place, those are the issues people care about." [...] McGovern defeated Crews with 71 percent of the vote, and ran unopposed in 2006 and 2008.|$|E

[...] When Paar more seriously asked if jobs would solve the problems of urban ghettos, Kennedy replied that while job opportunity was important, it needed to be accompanied by [...] "compassion for one's fellow human beings."

500|$|The song {{has never}} been {{performed}} live, although it was rehearsed extensively in an acoustic form prior to the third leg of the Zoo TV Tour in 1992. The end of the song segued into the beginning of [...] "Zoo Station", leading concert historian Pimm Jal de la Parra to speculate that it was being considered to open the set. In 2006, The Edge said [...] "it never became a live favourite... I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what people come to U2 for." [...] In 2012, Willie Williams, U2's lighting designer and concert director, described the rehearsed version as [...] "extremely dramatic", saying [...] "in a stadium situation {{it could be argued}} that it might have the same dramatic impact as walking out on stage and telling the audience to fuck off." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} mixed by Bruce Swedien times—unusual for Swedien, who usually mixed a song just once. Jones had told Swedien {{to create a}} drum sound {{that no one had}} ever heard before. The audio {{engineer}} was also told to add a different element: [...] "sonic personality". [...] "What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little things, like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat" [...] Swedien later wrote. [...] "The bottom line is that there aren't many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is." [...] He concluded, [...] "But I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the case with 'Billie Jean'—and that I attribute to sonic personality." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Edwards {{was part}} of a panel that {{appeared}} on CNN's Paula Zahn Now, along with Roland S. Martin and Jesse Lee Peterson. The purpose was to discuss racial segregation in American cities. He told Zahn that white children should seek out those who share [...] "the same values and traditions and heroes," [...] and that [...] "forced integration" [...] was a [...] "march toward totalitarianism." [...] He said: [...] "Crime and violence follow African-Americans wherever they go, and if you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> racist, then spend some time on the mean streets of south Memphis." [...] Martin described his remarks as unfit for national television. Edwards made a second appearance on Paula Zahn Now in 2009, during which he said: [...] "Whites are in for the fight of their lives. America is becoming balkanized. We are being robbed of having a future in the very nation our ancestors carved from the wilderness." ...|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{decided that}} Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like [...] "someone who spends hours sort of steroiding himself up." [...] His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an {{extruded}} eagle statuette {{was removed from}} his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality {{and give it a}} sense of realism. Garland said: [...] "If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he’d be in big trouble. Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection." [...] Remaining faithful to the comic, Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film. Urban said: [...] "He {{is supposed to be the}} faceless representative of the law and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> part of his enigma...You wouldn't get to the end of a Sergio Leone Western and go, 'God, I didn't even know the character's name!'

[...] Speaking to NME, Borland moved to clarify the comments, saying [...] "When I first read {{the description of the}} cruise I realised {{it is what it is}} and I thought I'd have some fun with it...I'll retract everything if I don't see a big muscly frat boy moshing in the pit.

Eric tries to convince Amy to return home to lead the life she had always wanted, because [...] "deep down he really cares about her." [...] The strict parenting role is played once again with Eric, and Halfpenny branded the moment as Amy [...] "meeting her match." [...] As [...] "nothing is straight forward with Amy", she returns home but finds telling the truth hard. Amy settles into village life until Jared Haynes (Philip Hill-Pearson) arrives and blackmails Amy.

500|$|Corporal Burdett later stated, [...] "When McCudden {{took off}} {{he put the}} machine into a nearly {{vertical}} climb, seemed to do a half-roll and then nosed dived into a wood.....it was usual for scout pilots to perform some little stunt.....I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what he was doing." [...] Witness Lieutenant L.M Fenton had a different view, [...] "the aircraft took off into wind and at about 100 feet did a vertical turn and flew back across the aerodrome {{by the side of}} the wood. The engine appeared to be running badly. The pilot rolled the machine, which failed to straighten out, at approximately 200 feet. It crashed nose down into the wood." [...] Lieutenant E.M Greenwood stated he thought the crash was the result of a failed aerobatic manoeuvre: [...] "I was watching an S.E.5 flying over the aerodrome at about 200 feet, when it did one complete roll to the right, then dived steeply to the ground behind the trees." [...] Lieutenant K.V King believed a similar thing: [...] "......very low over the aerodrome, going east towards the wood on the south-east side of the aerodrome. He had apparently been rolling. I saw him nose down and engine off entering the trees and immediately afterwards heard a crash." [...] Lieutenant [...] T.H Barry, though supports the notion that something was amiss with the engine:"I saw an S.E.5 flying from west to east across the aerodrome at 200–300 feet. The engine was firing irregularly. Just after crossing the end of the aerodrome the pilot did a sharp stalling turn. The nose dropped and it dived behind the trees. During this dive the noise of the engine ceased." ...|$|E
