In the description it was stated that the holotype material had been deposited, as <b>tissue</b> <b>collection</b> No. 699, at the José Celestino Mutis Natural History Museum of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Pamplona. This was denied by people associated with the museum, which has neither a <b>tissue</b> <b>collection</b> nor anything deposited under No. 699. An associate of the museum did receive an envelope with the feathers, {{but he was not}} informed about its great significance and it was not moved to the collection until after the description of the new species. The museum does not have an ornithological curator or the means to preserve such an important sample. Consequently they have forwarded the material to the relevant authorities to allow them to take charge in its depositing and preservation.|$|E

40|$|Placental {{separation}} {{is a complex}} physiological event in reproductive physiology and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. When comparing different experiments the timing of <b>tissue</b> <b>collections</b> is a signifi cant consideration due to the variability in time between fetal expulsion and expulsion of the placenta (30 min to 3 ̆e 24 h). This makes comparison of tissues samples across animals diffi cult and supports the need for serial <b>tissue</b> <b>collections</b> within animal. Additionally, the instrument most commonly used, a modifi ed Richter-Resinsinger effeminator, for placentome collections is diffi cult to obtain {{and there are no}} data in the literature record regarding subsequent reproductive performance of animals subjected placentome collections. To facilitate continued research into the physiology behind placental separation, we designed an instrument from readily available components and performed serial transvaginal placentome collections in cattle. Three placentomes at 2 -h intervals were collected after expulsion of the calf in 18 multiparous cows. There was no incidence of mortality and all cows resumed estrous after the procedure. Neither time from placentome collection nor age had a signifi - cant effect on pregnancy status at diagnosis (P 3 ̆e 0. 05).

40|$|ABSTRACT- Molecular {{methods to}} analyse DNA {{variability}} are opening new perspectives {{in the role}} played by museums in biodiversity research. DNA can be extracted from specific <b>tissue</b> <b>collections,</b> as well as from traditional voucher specimens. Ancient and museum DNA research produce valuable information for defining the phylogenetic positions of extinct taxa, the reconstruction of molecular and organismal evolution in extinct species, the characterization of extinct populations, including animal diets or microbial infections. Historical DNA samples are important sources of information also for conservation and evolutionary studies. In this paper, the methods used for ancient DNA analysis and the main results reported in published studies are reviewed.

Neurofibrillary tangles have been found in the brains of dementia pugilistica patients, but not in the same distribution as is usually found in people with Alzheimer's. One group examined slices of brain from patients having had multiple mild traumatic brain injuries and found changes in the cells' cytoskeletons, which they suggested might be due to damage to cerebral blood vessels.|$|E

Yet the safety and acceptability of circumcision and sigmoidoscopy (and associated abstinence recommendations) are unknown in uncircumcised {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) at high risk of HIV infection. Twenty-nine HIV-seronegative high-risk Peruvian MSM agreed to elective sigmoidoscopy biopsy collections (weeks 2 and 27) and circumcision (week 4) in a 28 -week cohort study designed to mimic an HIV vaccine study mucosal collection protocol. We monitored adherence to abstinence recommendations, procedure-related complications, HIV infections, peripheral immune activation, and retention. Twenty-three (79. 3 %) underwent a first sigmoidoscopy, 21 (72. 4 %) were circumcised, and 16 (55. 2 %) completed a second sigmoidoscopy during the study period. All who underwent procedures completed the associated follow-up safety visits. Those completing the procedures reported they were well tolerated, and complication rates were similar to those reported in the literature. Immune activation was detected during the healing period (1 week post-sigmoidoscopy, 6 weeks post-circumcision), including increases in CCR 5 +CD 4 +T cells and α 4 β 7 +CD 4 +T cells. Most participants adhered to post-circumcision abstinence recommendations whereas reduced adherence occurred post-sigmoidoscopy. Rectosigmoid mucosal and genital <b>tissue</b> <b>collections</b> were safe in high-risk MSM. Although the clinical implications of the post-procedure increase in peripheral immune activation markers are unknown, they reinforce the need to provide ongoing risk reduction counseling and support for post-procedure abstinence recommendations.

However, to meet the increasing demand for human brain tissue from the scientific community, many professional brain-banking activities aiming at both neurologic and psychiatric diseases as well as healthy controls are currently being initiated worldwide.

40|$|The {{significant}} {{potential of}} tissue-based proteomic biomarker studies can be restricted by difficulties in accessing samples in optimal fresh-frozen form.

40|$|The {{last decade}} or so has seen major {{advances}} in two key areas of biomedicine: new genetic technologies and stem cell technology. The ongoing success of the research endeavour is predicated on access to essential raw materials: human tissue, human cells and human genetic information. <b>Tissue</b> <b>collections,</b> banked cell lines and databases of genetic information, which are referred to collectively here as human genetic databanks, are vital stores of these research tools. There is a need for human genetic databanks to have adequate and appropriate intellectual property and access policies that provide some certainty in the rights and obligations of all parties involved. It is argued in this paper that one essential requirement for such policies is that they should explicitly make provision for benefit sharing arrangements from two distinct perspectives: general benefit to society at large; and specific benefit to the sources of the original human biological material and/or their social groupings...|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} {{application of}} metabolomics is {{the evaluation of}} tissues, which are often the primary sites of metabolic dysregulation in disease. Laboratory rodents {{have been widely used}} for metabolomics studies involving tissues due to their facile handing, genetic manipulability and similarity to most aspects of human metabolism. However, the necessary step of administration of anesthesia in preparation for tissue sampling is not often given careful consideration, in spite of its potential for causing alterations in the metabolome. We examined, for the first time using untargeted and targeted metabolomics, the effect of several commonly used methods of anesthesia and euthanasia for collection of skeletal muscle, liver, heart, adipose and serum of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. The data revealed dramatic, tissue-specific impacts of <b>tissue</b> <b>collection</b> strategy. Among many differences observed, post-euthanasia samples showed elevated levels of glucose 6 -phosphate and other glycolytic intermediates in skeletal muscle. In heart and liver, multiple nucleotide and purine degradation metabolites accumulated in tissues of euthanized compared to anesthetized animals. Adipose tissue was comparatively less affected by collection strategy, although accumulation of lactate and succinate in euthanized animals was observed in all tissues. Among methods of <b>tissue</b> <b>collection</b> performed pre-euthanasia, ketamine showed more variability compared to isoflurane and pentobarbital. Isoflurane induced elevated liver aspartate but allowed more rapid initiation of <b>tissue</b> <b>collection.</b> Based on these findings, we present a more optimal collection strategy mammalian tissues and recommend that rodent tissues intended for metabolomics studies be collected under anesthesia rather than post-euthanasia...|$|E
