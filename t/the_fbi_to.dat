However, they are rudely greeted by Deputy Chief Karras and Lieutenant Bianco of the transit police; the two eagerly want <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>to</b> {{get the job done}} fast in order that subways can be reopened in five hours, and Karras is also irritated that Scully performed an autopsy on the body. Even after an autopsy, Scully has no idea what killed the man, and the CDC is unable to find any biological or chemical agents in the subway.|$|E

Henriksen portrayed Frank Black, an offender profiler who worked for the Millennium Group, a private investigative organisation. Black retired from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to move his wife (Gallagher) and daughter (Tiplady) to Seattle, where he began to consult on criminal cases for the Group.

Evidence is found of military-style tyre and boot tracks; these lead <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>to</b> an address where they find the second kidnapper murdered—Black and Watts clash over whether the Group or Swan are responsible. Back in the examination room, Swan exposes Taylor to a substance contained in a canister.|$|E

She refuses to wear a wire and informs the FBI that she {{may be able to}} persuade her fiancé Christopher to co-operate and become an informant against Tony. She confesses to Christopher that she has been informing and that the FBI would give them new identities if they would testify. Christopher is grief-stricken and nearly kills her. He leaves the apartment, saying he needs time to think. Tony has Silvio pick up Adriana under the pretense of taking her to see Christopher, but instead drives her out to the woods and executes her. Adriana’s betrayal and subsequent execution is too much for Christopher to handle and he briefly returns to drug abuse to deal with the pain.|$|E

He starts to head back towards town, but his progress is hampered by shadowy figures that try to kill him. He observes a strange figure in a diving suit who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light. Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled Departure with {{his name on the}} by-line, a work he had not written. Eventually making it to town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states that there has been no island or cabin in Cauldron lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior.

Black is framed for the death of a fellow agent, prompting his resignation from the FBI and flight with Jordan to Washington D.C., and Hollis abandons him to work with the group. Several years later, Black works with FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to foil a last-ditch effort by the group to orchestrate the end of the world; vindicated, he reunites with Jordan after the case.|$|E

At the same time, Doggett notices Nora Pearce at the lab, looking through files for the person responsible. Later, the halfway house is raided by <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>to</b> find Pearce.

5|$|The {{same day}} in July, Margarette Gillespie, an FBI analyst {{working in the}} CTC, was told to review {{material}} about the Malaysia meeting. She was not told of the participants' presence in the U.S. The CIA gave Gillespie surveillance photos of Mihdhar and Hazmi from the meeting to show to FBI counterterrorism, but did not tell her their significance. The Intelink database informed her not to share intelligence material on the meeting to criminal investigators. When shown the photos, the FBI were refused more details on their significance, and also did not receive Mihdhar's date of birth or passport number. In late August 2001, Gillespie told the INS, the State Department, the Customs Service, and <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>to</b> put Hazmi and Mihdhar on their watchlists, but the FBI was prohibited from using criminal agents {{in the search for}} the duo, which hindered their efforts.|$|E
5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>to</b> shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E

5|$|Later, Scully {{speaks with}} the man. He claims he {{received}} his burns due to alien testing and that he knew Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). He further elaborates that {{he was sent to}} <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>to</b> retrieve certain files. Scully suspects the man is lying, but asks to examine his burns to investigate his strange claims. He notes that they are the result of an injection that failed to transform him into one of the aliens. The man claims a new conspiracy has formed after the previous one was destroyed; the new one being hidden within the government and the conspirators involved being alien. Doggett theorizes that the man is actually Mulder. Scully takes the man to her house to give him the files he seeks. Suddenly, William begins to cry, only to be quieted when the scarred man picks him up. Meanwhile, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) meets with Doggett and the two discuss the idea that the man is actually Mulder. Skinner points out the inconsistencies in Doggett's reasoning, but a DNA test is undertaken anyway.|$|E

Frank gives himself up and is sentenced to 12 years in prison, getting visits from time to time from Carl. When Frank points out how one of the checks Carl is carrying as evidence is fake, Carl convinces <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> <b>to</b> offer Frank a deal by which he can live out the remainder of his sentence working for the bank fraud department of the FBI, which Frank accepts.
