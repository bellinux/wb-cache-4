Methods: C 4 -C 5 and C 5 -C 6 cervical segments removed from human cadavers of both genders were assessed and divided into five groups of 10 -year age intervals, from 21 years old. TVP and intervertebral disc thickness evaluation was made {{by means of}} histomorphometry of histological slides stained with hematoxylin and eosyn. Lower C 4 TVP, upper C 5 TVP, and upper C 6 TVP de were compared between {{each other and to}} the interposed intervertebral disc thickness between relevant TVP. Results: The thickness of <b>terminal</b> vertebral <b>plates</b> adjacent to the same ID did not show statistic differences. However, the comparison of upper and lower vertebral plates thickness on the same cervical vertebra (C 5), showed statistical difference on all age groups studied. We found a statistical correlation coefficient above 80 % between <b>terminal</b> vertebral <b>plate</b> and adjacent intervertebral disc, with a proportional thickness reduction of both structures on the different cervical levels studied, and also on the different age groups assessed. Conclusion: <b>Terminal</b> vertebral <b>plate</b> shows a morphologic correlation with the intervertebral disc next to it, and does not show correlation with the <b>terminal</b> vertebral <b>plate</b> on the same vertebra...|$|R

5000|$|Both hairy {{and smooth}} pads in {{arthropods}} act {{to maximize the}} amount of contact with a surface. The foot pads of flies are densely covered with flexible hair-like structures called setae, and some lizards and spiders use similar hairy pads to create adhesive effects. This indicates a favourable design for hairy pad adhesion. [...] Hairy pads can be classified as pulvillus, fossula spongiosa, and tenent hairs. Hairy attachment pads employed few other features, such as flaw tolerance, lower sensitivity to contamination and roughness. Hairy attachment systems are typical for evolutionary younger and successful insect groups, such as Coleoptera and Diptera. The density of hairs increases with increasing body weight. An increase of the attachment strength in hairy systems is realized by {{increasing the number of}} single contact points. [...] Protuberances on the hairy pads of Coleoptera, Dermaptera and Diptera belong to different types. Representatives of the first two lineages have socketed setae on their pads. [...] Setae can range in length from a few micrometers to several millimeters. [...] Dipteran outgrowths are acanthae which are single sclerotized protuberances originating from a single cell. The acanthae are hollow inside and some have pores under the <b>terminal</b> <b>plate,</b> which presumably deliver an adhesive secretion directly to the contact area. Hairy attachment pads of reduviid bugs, flies [...] and beetles [...] secrete fluid into the contact area. The secretion contains non-volatile, lipid-like substances, but in some species it is two-phasic emulsion presumably containing water-soluble and lipid-soluble fractions. [...] Adhesion strongly decreases as the volume of the secretion decreases, which indicates that a layer of pad secretion that covers the terminal plates is crucial for generating a strong attractive force. Data suggests that besides van der Waals and Coulomb forces flies rely on attractive capillary forces mediated by the pad secretion. At low humidity, adhesion strongly depends on the amount of liquid deposited on the surface, and therefore contact duration.|$|E

40|$|A typical {{luxury car}} has {{in excess of}} 400 {{electrical}} connectors with over 3000 individual <b>terminals.</b> Tin <b>plated</b> <b>terminals</b> are still widely used because of particular technical and commercial advantages, but this type of plating is susceptible to fretting corrosion leading to intermittent high contact resistance.

A mechanical model of the polymer interface is developed showing its behaviour under fretting conditions.

40|$|A {{new species}} of Oikozetetes, O. mounti n. sp. is {{described}} from the upper Mernmerna Formation (equivalent to Cambrian Series 2) in the eastern Flinders Ranges, South Australia. Description of both shell morphotypes (morph A and B) from the same stratigraphic horizon favors the interpretation of a two-shelled scleritome for Oikozetetes. Identification {{of at least two}} types of halkieriid sclerite (palmates and siculates) in stratigraphic association with the Halkieria-like shells of Oikozetetes suggests that these elements are derived from the same scleritome. This provides evidence against previous suggestions that the Gondwanan species was aspiculate; the scleritome arrangement is interpreted to be similar to Halkieria evangelista Conway Morris and Peel, 1995 and supports placement in the family Halkieriidae Poulsen, 1967. Comparison of modes of accretionary growth in Oikozetetes shell morphotypes to Halkieria shells and <b>terminal</b> <b>plates</b> in modern polyplacophorans, supports a scleritome model that places shell morphs A and B in posterior and anterior locations, respectively, along the axis of the body. 13 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the transition}} zone between the <b>terminal</b> <b>plate</b> of the basal body and the 9 + 2 region of the somatic (non-oral) cilium has been examined in Paramecium tetraurelia. Freeze-fracture and thin- section techniques disclosed both membrane specializations and various internal structural linkages. Freeze-fracture material revealed sets of particles interrupting the unit membrane. The more distal of these form plaquelike arrays while the proximal set of particles forms the ciliary "necklace. " The plaque regions correspond to anionic sites on the outer membrane surface as revealed by binding of polycationic ferritin. Both the plaque particles and the necklace particles {{appear to be in}} contact with outer doublet microtubules via a complex of connecting structures. In the interior {{of the transition}} zone an axosomal plate supports an axosome surrounded by a ring of lightly packed material. Only one of the two central tubules of the axoneme reaches and penetrates the axosome. Below the axosomal plate four rings, each approx. 20 nm wide, connect adjacent outer doublets. An intermediate plate lies proximal to these rings, and a <b>terminal</b> <b>plate</b> marks the proximal boundary of this zone. Nine transitional fibers extend from the region of the <b>terminal</b> <b>plate</b> to the plasmalemma. The observations described above have been used to construct a three-dimensional model of the transition region of "wild-type" Paramecium somatic cilia. It is anticipated that this model will be useful in future studies concerning possible function of transition-zone specializations, since Paramecium may be examined in both normal and reversed ciliary beating modes, and since mutants incapable of reverse beating are available...|$|E

In this study, stress type of elevated temperature/ humidity exposure at 55 °C/ 85 %RH with the storage for up to 24 months was conducted to define the acceleration factor in samples with deposition of immersion Sn plating and Sn solder dipping. The addition of Nickel (Ni) under-layer was also applied to examine the correlation to field conditions. The results showed that the whisker length increased in high humidity irrespective of the deposition methods. It was also shown that pure Sn solder dipping mitigated the whisker growth but does not completely prevent it when alloying Sn with 0. 4 %wtCu. Additionally, Ni under-layer was indicated to be more efficient in mitigating the growth of whisker by prolonging the incubation time for whisker formation...|$|R
