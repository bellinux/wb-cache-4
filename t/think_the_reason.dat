He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release, saying, [...] "Any good reporter could have done this story, but I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> I did it, and no one else did, is because I am gay. It was happening to people I cared about and loved." [...] The book was later adapted into an HBO film of the same name in 1993.

[...] Nichols stated that he doesn't consider Tucker a villain, but considers him a [...] "player". Following the reveal that Katherine was Tucker's long lost mother, Nichols was asked if Tucker has abandonment issues, to which he stated: [...] "He has all that stuff, but he {{has found a way}} to create a very strong armor. He doesn’t let it break very often. He does not let anyone see his true feelings, and I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> he is such a player is, and it’s my take on it now, is that it’s for that very reason. He does not want to get close to anyone. He does not want to get hurt." [...] In a separate interview, the actor stated: [...] "Family and Katherine in particular means more to Tucker than he is willing to admit and his feelings for Katherine are sneaking up on him." [...] He also described the character as [...] "very, very cool, and [...] "full of a lot of fire and a lot of surprises".|$|E

Since Batman, the character has had a long history of appearances in television and other media. As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon plays a supporting role in a string of animated series, voiced by Jane Webb in The Batman/Superman Hour (1968), Melendy Britt in The New Adventures of Batman (1977), Melissa Gilbert in [...] (1992), Tara Strong in The New Batman Adventures (1997) and Beware the Batman (2013), Danielle Judovits in The Batman (2004), Mae Whitman in [...] (2008) and Alyson Stoner in Young Justice (2011). The Batman series also showcased the character's first animated adaptation as Oracle, voiced by Kellie Martin in the episode [...] "Artifacts" [...] (2007). She also appears in DC Super Hero Girls voiced by Mae Whitman in season 1 as Barbara Gordon and season 2 as Batgirl. Other variations of the character that have been adapted into other media include an elderly Barbara Gordon, voiced by Stockard Channing and Angie Harmon in 1999's Batman Beyond, who after retiring as Batgirl, became commissioner of the Gotham City police department.|$|E

At the time when only surgeons were influenced by the findings in the literature, the anesthesiologists evaluated the patient in the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Department and the surgery was performed either in the emergency operating room on the same day if free or in the first free slot in the orthopedic operating room. In our hospital, this procedure alone leads to a suboptimal early treatment rate (G 2) underlining the difficulties of orthopedic surgeons alone in performing early surgery without the involvement of anesthesiologists, bed managers and emergency doctors.|$|R

6000|$|Dante {{entitled}} the saddest poem {{in the world}} a Comedy, because {{it was written in}} a middle style; though some, by a strange confusion of ideas, <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> must have been because it [...] "ended happily!" [...] that is, because, beginning with hell (to some), it terminated with [...] "heaven" [...] (to others). As well might they have said, that a morning's work in the Inquisition ended happily, because, while people were being racked in the dungeons, the officers were making merry in the drawing-room. For the much-injured epithet of [...] "Divine," [...] Dante's memory is not responsible. He entitled his poem, arrogantly enough, yet still not with that impiety of arrogance, [...] "The Comedy of Dante Alighieri, a Florentine by nation but not by habits." [...] The word [...] "divine" [...] was added by some transcriber; and it heaped absurdity on absurdity, too much of it, alas! being literally infernal tragedy. I am not speaking in mockery, any further than the fact itself cannot help so speaking. I respect what is to be respected in Dante; I admire in him what is admirable; would love (if his infernalities would let me) what is loveable; but this must not hinder one of the human race from protesting against what is erroneous in his fame, when it jars against every best feeling, human and divine. Mr. Cary thinks that Dante had as much right to avail himself of [...] "the popular creed in all its extravagance" [...] as Homer had of his gods, or Shakspeare of his fairies. But the distinction is obvious. Homer did not personally identify himself with a creed, or do his utmost to perpetuate the worst parts of it in behalf of a ferocious inquisitorial church, and to the risk of endangering the peace of millions of gentle minds.|$|E

6000|$|Eloquence {{in three}} {{languages}} is good; {{but it is}} not the best. To us, as already hinted, the Lord Abbot's eloquence is less admirable than his ineloquence, his great invaluable 'talent of silence'! '"Deus, Deus," [...] said the Lord Abbot to me once, when he heard the Convent were murmuring at some act of his, [...] "I have much need to remember that Dream they had of me, that I was to rage among them like a wolf. Above all earthly things I dread their driving me to do it. How much do I hold in, and wink at; raging and shuddering in my own secret mind, and not outwardly at all!" [...] He would boast to me at other times: [...] "This and that I have seen, this and that I have heard; yet patiently stood it." [...] He had this way, too, which I have never seen in any other man, that he affectionately loved many persons to whom he never or hardly ever showed a countenance of love. Once on my venturing to expostulate with him on the subject, he reminded me of Solomon: [...] "Many sons I have; it is not fit that I should smile on them." [...] He would suffer faults, damage from his servants, and know what he suffered, and not speak of it; but I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> was, he waited a good time for speaking of it, and in a wise way amending it. He intimated, openly in chapter to us all, that he would have no eavesdropping: [...] "Let none," [...] said he, [...] "come to me secretly accusing another, unless he will publicly stand to the same; if he come otherwise, I will openly proclaim the name of him. I wish, too, that every Monk of you have free access to me, to speak of your needs or grievances when you will." ...|$|E
60|$|I think Mrs. Eddy {{was born}} with a far-seeing business-eye, but did not know it; and with a great {{organizing}} and executive talent, and did not know it; and with a large appetite for power and distinction, and did not know it.

The qualities that were born in her had to wait for circumstance and opportunity--but they were there: they were there to stay, whether they ever got a chance to fructify or not. If they had come early, they would have found her ready and competent. And they--not she--would have determined what they would set her at and what they would make of her. If they had elected to commission her as second-assistant cook in a bankrupt boarding-house, I know the rest of it--I know what would have happened. She would have owned the boarding-house within six months; she would have had the late proprietor on salary and humping himself, as the worldly say; she would have had that boarding-house spewing money like a mint; she would have worked the servants and the late landlord up to the limit; she would have squeezed the boarders till they wailed, and by some mysterious quality born in her she would have kept the affections of certain of the lot whose love and esteem she valued, and flung the others down the back area; in two years she would own all the boarding-houses in the town, in five all the boarding-houses in the State, in twenty all the hotels in America, in forty all the hotels on the planet, and would sit at home with her finger on a button and govern the whole combination as easily as a bench-manager governs a dog-show.|$|E

In this shape He is watching every feeling of your hearts, discerning your most secret intents, seeing through and through the thoughts which you would confess to no human being, hardly even to yourselves. This is He, a living Christ, an almighty Christ, an all-seeing Christ, and yet a most patient and loving Christ. He needs not our pity; but our gratitude, our obedience, our worship. Why seek Him among the dead? He is not there, He is risen! He is not there, He is here! Bow yourselves before Him now; for He {{is in the midst of}} you; and those eyes of His, more piercing than the mid-day sunbeams, are upon you, and your hearts, and your thoughts, and upon mine also.
