50|$|As {{the common}} name suggests, least seedsnipes rely mostly on seeds, {{but they will}} also eat leaves and buds and as such are {{strictly}} vegetarian in their natural habitat. However, in captivity they {{have been known to}} eat mealworms. Unlike most Charadriiformes, least seedsnipes possess a crop, a gizzard and long intestinal caeca. They have been observed foraging from a crouched position, rapidly snapping off plants and swallowing the fragments whole. They also stretch to bite off the <b>top</b> of <b>grasses</b> and tall herbs and are well-suited to browsing. They derive most if not all of their water needs from succulent plants and are only very rarely seen drinking water.|$|R
50|$|The Rocky Mountain wood tick {{is usually}} found {{attached}} to a host, but when it is without a host, it hides in cracks and crevices, as well as soil. If {{for some reason the}} tick is not able to find a host before the winter, it will stay under groundcover until spring, when it can resume its search. The wood tick does not typically seek hosts in the hottest summer months. Adult ticks tend to climb to the <b>tops</b> of <b>grasses</b> or low shrubs, attaching themselves to a host wandering by. They secure the attachment by secreting a cement-like substance from their mouths, inserting it into the host.|$|R
5000|$|The winery building, {{including}} grounds, is {{the only}} United States project built by Viennese architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser (1928-2000). Among other unusual touches, the winery is designed in a whimsical, exotic way with ceramic tiles, irregularly rounded and painted columns, and deliberately uneven floors designed for their tactile effect on occupants' feet. [...] There are no right angles, except in the basement. The design style has been called phantasmagoric, psychedelic, and Dr. Seuss-like, [...] and also likened to [...] "the creation of a beautifully demented child". [...] The winery structure is dominated by an onion dome covered in gold leaf, {{as well as a}} living roof <b>topped</b> with <b>grass,</b> bushes, and trees.|$|R

5000|$|The lancet {{liver fluke}} (Dicrocoelium dendriticum) is a {{parasitic}} trematode with a complex life cycle. In its adult state {{it occurs in}} the liver of its definitive host (ruminants), where it reproduces. The parasite eggs are passed with the feces of the host, which then are eaten by a terrestrial snail (first intermediate host). The fluke matures into a juvenile stage in the snail, which {{in an attempt to}} protect itself excretes the parasites in [...] "slime-balls". The [...] "slime-balls" [...] are then consumed by ants (second intermediate hosts). The fluke manipulates the ant to move up to the <b>top</b> of <b>grass,</b> where they have a higher chance of being eaten by grazing ruminants.|$|R
