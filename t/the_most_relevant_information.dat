50|$|This {{correspondence}} {{problem can}} occur with both static and animated graphics. On a purely perceptual level, our attention {{tends to be}} attracted by some parts of a static display more than by other parts due to their visuospatial properties. For example, an object that is centrally placed, relatively large, unusually shaped, and of a sharply contrasting colour or texture is likely to 'jump out' of the display so that we notice it very easily. Other items in the display may receive correspondingly less attention as a result. Well-designed static educational graphics {{take advantage of these}} perceptual effects. They manipulate the characteristics of the display in order to direct learner attention to <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>information.</b> This helps to ensure that the learner will extract the required information from the display. There is a problem {{in the design of the}} animation shown above in this respect. Unfortunately, there are many 'educational' graphics being produced that fail to provide learners with sufficient support of this type. Designers of animation need to take such consideration into account.|$|E
5000|$|Fixed costs, {{innately}} do {{not vary}} with outputs and usually are {{not associated with}} individual outputs' costs. However, in practice, GPK adopters often calculate a standard per-unit-rate for fixed product/service costs and a separate per-unit-rate for proportional product/service costs. The balance of costs not causally assignable {{to the lowest level}} product or service can be assigned at yet higher levels within the marginal costing system's multi-level Profit & Loss (P&L) statement. For example, with GPK, fixed costs that relate to a product group or a product line (e.g., R&D, advertising costs) are assigned to the product group or product line reporting/management dimension in the P&L. This marginal costing approach offers managers greater flexibility to view, analyze and monitor costs (e.g., all product and cost-to-serve costs) for their area of responsibility. Thus GPK assigns all costs to the P&L but it does not fully absorb to the lowest level product or service. GPK's multi-dimensional marginal view of the organization supports operational managers with <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>information</b> for strategic decision-making purposes about [...] "what products or services to offer" [...] and at [...] "what price to sell them".|$|E
50|$|Another way {{search engine}} {{marketing}} is managed is by contextual advertising. Here marketers place ads on other sites or portals that carry information relevant to their products so that the ads jump into the circle of vision of browsers who are seeking information from those sites. A successful SEM plan is the approach to capture the relationships amongst information searchers, businesses, and search engines. Search engines were not important to some industries in the past, {{but over the past}} years the use of search engines for accessing information has become vital to increase business opportunities. The use of SEM strategic tools for businesses such as tourism can attract potential consumers to view their products, but it could also pose various challenges. These challenges could be the competition that companies face amongst their industry and other sources of information that could draw the attention of online consumers. To assist the combat of challenges, the main objective for businesses applying SEM is to improve and maintain their ranking as high as possible on SERPs so that they can gain visibility. Therefore, search engines are adjusting and developing algorithms and the shifting criteria by which web pages are ranked sequentially to combat against search engine misuse and spamming, and to supply <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>information</b> to searchers. This could enhance the relationship amongst information searchers, businesses, and search engines by understanding the strategies of marketing to attract business.|$|E

5000|$|...Principle 1: Responsibility. Access to {{environmental}} resources carries attendant responsibilities {{to use them}} in an ecologically sustainable, economically efficient, and socially fair manner. Individual and corporate responsibilities and incentives should be aligned {{with each other and}} with broad social and ecological goals.*Principle 2: Scale-matching. Ecological problems are rarely confined to a single scale. Decision-making on environmental resources should (i) be assigned to institutional levels that maximize ecological input, (ii) ensure the flow of ecological information between institutional levels, (iii) take ownership and actors into account, and (iv) internalize costs and benefits. Appropriate scales of governance will be those that have <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>information,</b> can respond quickly and efficiently, and are able to integrate across scale boundaries.*Principle 3: Precaution. In the face of uncertainty about potentially irreversible environmental impacts, decisions concerning their use should err on the side of caution. The burden of proof should shift to those whose activities potentially damage the environment.*Principle 4: Adaptive management. Given that some level of uncertainty always exists in environmental resource management, decision-makers should continuously gather and integrate appropriate ecological, social, and economic information with the goal of adaptive improvement.*Principle 5: Full cost allocation. All of the internal and external costs and benefits, including social and ecological, of alternative decisions concerning the use of environmental resources should be identified and allocated. When appropriate, markets should be adjusted to reflect full costs.*Principle 6: Participation. All stakeholders should be engaged in the formulation and implementation of decisions concerning environmental resources. Full stakeholder awareness and participation contributes to credible, accepted rules that identify and assign the corresponding responsibilities appropriately.|$|E
50|$|Transparency {{of media}} {{ownership}} {{refers to the}} public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures to make possible for media authorities and the wider public to ascertain who effectively owns and controls the media. In Romania transparency of media ownership is addressed directly in the Constitution and is regulated by a media-specific law, namely the Audiovisual Law no. 504, and by national company law. As for constitutional provisions, even if Romania is among the few European countries that addresses the issue of media transparency directly in the Constitution, it should {{be said that the}} focus is on transparency of financial sources and not on ownership. Nonetheless, despite the constitutional provisions on the right to impose an obligation on the media to make public their sources of finance, the Parliament has never enacted the applicable legislation which is indeed absent. The Romanian media-specific law requiring the disclosure of media ownership information applies only to the broadcast sector and provides the disclosure to both a public authority, namely the National Audiovisual Council (CNA) and directly to the public. Finally, also the national company law contains provisions regulating transparency of media ownership. It applies to all media which are registered companies and foresees the obligation to publish all <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>information</b> on companies' ownership in the Trade Register Company. Overall, even though the Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is fully aligned with the European standards, in practice sufficient information to assess who effectively owns and ultimately controls the media is not always available.|$|E
50|$|Freedom {{of speech}} and freedom of {{religion}} {{have been at the}} center of debates concerning the events of the scandal described in this article but it must be kept in mind that the forums for the scandal and subsequent discussion have been newspapers. The actions of the National Post and the Toronto Sun beg the question: what role do we, as a society, expect newspapers to fulfill, and how well are they fulfilling it? Newspapers are first and foremost sources of information; they must be aware of the events that are occurring in our immediate surroundings as well as in the rest of the world and filter that information in order to relay <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>information</b> to the public. They have great power in their prerogative to choose what to relay and what to withhold; they can capture specific audiences with what they select to publish. Newspapers have evolved from merely being sources of information or even entertainment to being a reflection of their readers. The National Post, for example, has taken a conservative position; in a vicious cycle, conservative readers know that they can expect the Post’s point of view to match their own and the Post will continue to take a conservative stance to keep up with their readers’ expectations. The ad sponsored by ICV was technically in keeping with their position - strictly in terms of its political stance - and is well within the Post’s freedom of expression rights. Their retraction seems therefore to be driven by something more than tolerance; the Post recognizes that their role as a newspaper, in addition to reporting news and catering to their audience’s political views, is to provide a platform for safe discussion and the advertisement violated that safety. We live in a time in which newspapers have shifted to the online world; the internet is part of the public sphere and has the power to foster discussion on any number of topics. The role of a newspaper on its website is therefore to encourage balanced and informed discussion and to let readers form their own opinions without overwhelming bias from third-party sources.|$|E
