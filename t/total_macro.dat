In general, it increases with profile depth, due to changes in organic matter content, porosity and compaction. The main objective of this work {{was to investigate the}} dependence of bulk density on texture, organic matter content and available nutrients (macro and micro nutrients) for soil of Coimbatore. The relationships between some physical and chemical properties of soil such as, clay content (C), silt content (Si), sand content (S), CaCO 3, organic matter content (OMC), <b>total</b> <b>macro</b> and micro nutrient content with soil bulk density (ρb) were studied for eight surface soil samples (0 - 15 cm). Soil bulk density showed negative relationships with all soil properties (Si, C, CaCO 3, OMC, <b>total</b> <b>macro</b> and total micro nutrient content) except with sand content (S). Besides texture and OMC, the nutrient concentration was also the most effective factor that affected the bulk density of soils.

40|$|The {{detonation}} velocity {{is one of}} the principal characteristics of energetic materials. Therefore, computer search for structures of materials with high {{detonation velocity}} is a very urgent problem. We formulated the following task : to elaborate a concept of computer design and subsequent screening of target structures with high detonation velocities. The present state of this concept and the operation of the program package are illustrated by computer generation of novel energetic compounds, including caged skeletons. Using some optimum gross formulas, we use methods of mathematical chemistry for computer generation of isomeric structural formulas, which may correspond to potentially interesting substances with high detonation velocity. Then, using different methods (mostly original) for estimating the properties of these compounds, we calculate their physicochemical characteristics and recommend some of them for synthesis. We also analyzed the possible sources of errors during calculation of some detonation characteristics and determined the possible error ranges for the calculated properties at the micro level (enthalpies of formation and molecular crystal densities). As a result, the <b>total</b> (<b>macro</b> level) errors in calculations of detonation parameters were determined...|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} known the {{multiple}} channel acceleration {{is the most}} adequate way to save initial beam parameters due {{to the possibility of}} decreasing Coulomb forces in intensive input beams.

Attempts to use conventional quadruple focusing channels both RF and electrostatic for multiple beam acceleration usually lead to extremely complicate and bulky construction of the structure.

The original version of the quadruple RF focusing multiple beam system called space lattice focusing (SLF) is supposed for getting intensive ion beam with extremely low divergence. The basic principles of the theoretical approach as well as some possible advances and restrictions for the practical use in RF linac are supposed to be discussed. (5 refs) ...|$|E

O latossolo foi disposto num esquema de delineamento em blocos casualizados e conduzido durante sete anos para avaliar algumas alterações em atributos físicos e químicos do solo, nas profundidades de 0 - 5; 5 - 15 e 15 - 30 cm. Os sistemas de manejo avaliados foram o convencional e os considerados conservacionistas. Os parâmetros analisados foram: densidade do solo, porosidade <b>total,</b> <b>macro</b> e microporosidade, estabilidade de agregados, carbono orgânico total (COT), fósforo (P), cálcio (Ca 2 +), magnésio (Mg 2 +), potássio (K+), nitrogênio (N) e alumínio (Al 3 +). Foram verificadas diferenças estatísticas entre os sistemas de manejo conservacionistas e o convencional. Os resultados indicam aumento da densidade do solo com a profundidade, associada à redução da porosidade total e da relação macro/microporos, bem como uma menor estabilidade de agregados no sistema convencional, em relação aos sistemas conservacionistas. Para os atributos químicos do solo, diferenças estatísticas entre os tratamentos conservacionistas e convencional foram observadas apenas nos primeiros 5 cm do solo, para os elementos P, Ca e K.

40|$|Thesis (PhD) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Worldwide, {{invasive}} alien plants (IAPs) alter {{aspects of}} invaded ecosystems including geomorphology, above-ground vegetation, soil seed banks and soil nutrient regimes, thereby affecting the long-term stability of ecosystems. In many cases these invasions call for various management interventions, including restoration. Effects of alien plant invaders on native ecosystems are widely acknowledged, {{but compared to}} terrestrial ecosystems, riparian habitats are poorly studied. Riparian habitats are inherently rich in biodiversity, but are particularly prone to invasion by IAPs because of their dynamic nature and because these ecosystems are affected by many anthropogenic activities. This enhances the proliferation of IAPs, especially trees such as Tamarix spp. (e. g. in the southwestern United States), Salix spp. (e. g. in Australia), and Australian Acacia spp. and Eucalyptus camaldulensis (in South Africa). Initiatives such as the Working for Water (WfW) programme in South Africa that are focusing on clearing IAPs, particularly in riparian zones, have reported much success in the short term, but ecosystem recovery remains limited. There is a poor {{understanding of the nature}} of the impacts of invasive trees, and of the opportunities that exist for ecosystem restoration. The objective of my thesis was to investigate the effects of the widespread invasions of Eucalyptus camaldulensis in riparian zones. Methodological constraints have been identified as one reason for limited success of restoration projects. Many studies examining the effects of IAPs used a comparative approach of uninvaded (reference) and invaded sites. However, this approach often fails to separate cause from effect. An experimental removal approach has been suggested as an alternative, but it is often inappropriate for large invasive trees owing to time and cost constraints. I used a comparative gradient approach, involving sampling along a continuum from uninvaded sites, and varying E. camaldulensis invasion densities categorised as “lightly”, “moderately” and “heavily” invaded (hereafter the gradient of invasion), each with four replicates (n = 16). This approach enabled me to detect trends that could be reliably attributed to invasion. Furthermore, my study attempted to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of IAPs in invaded ecosystems by considering various components of the ecosystem and integrating their feedback relationships to establish the net effects on ecosystem processes. The riparian zone is a unique ecosystem which provides an opportunity for such a multifaceted study examining and integrating the effects of invasive trees on riparian geomorphology, above-ground vegetation, soil seed banks, and soil properties. I studied the effects of E. camaldulensis invasion in riparian zones along the Berg River in the Mediterranean-type climate zone of the Western Cape, South Africa. I asked the questions 1) Are environmental conditions (i. e. the riparian environment created by geomorphological processes) altered by Eucalyptus invasion and if so, are these conditions less suitable for recruitment of indigenous species? 2. Has Eucalyptus invasion altered the composition of indigenous species (potentially limiting post-clearing propagule supply) ? 3 : How does Eucalyptus invasion change the composition of the riparian soil seed bank; and its potential to re-initiate ecosystem recovery? 4 : Do soil properties (physical and chemical) change with Eucalyptus invasion? Data for all four questions were collected in the same sites to enable cross comparisons. For the first question, I employed photogrammetry techniques in a GIS and remote sensing environment to analyse repeated aerial photographs (1938 - 2010) to reconstruct the invasion history and riparian geomorphology evolutionary dynamics. For the second and third questions, I compared richness, diversity, evenness and composition of resident above-ground and seed bank vegetation between uninvaded sites and the gradient of invaded sites. For the fourth question, I compared a set of variables describing physico-chemical properties in uninvaded sites to the gradient of invaded sites seasonally. Results of the geomorphology study showed that the riparian zone has been very dynamic over the 70 years, with a 13. 5 % net decrease in area. There was evidence of channel narrowing, riverbank steepening and river bed incision in areas that were densely invaded. No significant trends were detected in hydrometeorological data. The above-ground vegetation study revealed that species richness, diversity and structural attributes (e. g. height, relative cover and mean basal diameter) of native species decreased consistently along the invasion gradient. Invasion also altered native and alien plant species composition, both of which showed a high preference for lightly invaded sites. The seed bank study revealed that E. camaldulensis invasion had no significant effect on total and native species richness, diversity and evenness, however the effects were bigger on native than alien species. Alien species density was significantly higher than native species density. Invasion also influenced the composition of the native seed bank. However, native seed banks were more diverse than above-ground plant assemblages with some native fynbos species occurring only in the seed bank. In the soil study, I found that soil pH levels were significantly lower in invaded sites than in uninvaded sites in all seasons. Litter cover and thickness increased significantly with invasion intensity. Soil moisture decreased consistently with invasion intensity while temperature increased in winter and spring. <b>Total</b> <b>macro,</b> micro and available nutrients did not vary significantly along the invasion gradient (p > 0. 05), but exchangeable cation content was significantly higher in uninvaded than in invaded sites, especially in winter and spring. Narrowing of river channel and steepening of river banks reduces the suitability of the riparian zone to perform certain ecological functions such as soil seed storage and providing space for vegetation to grow. This reduces opportunities for seedling recruitment and consequently reduces species diversity. Conversely, the reduction of species diversity in above-ground vegetation reduces seed input into the soil leading to depauperate soil-stored seed banks. The abundance of seeds of Acacia mearnsii in the soil-stored seed bank poses a threat of secondary invasions post clearing of E. camaldulensis if this is adopted as a management action. The study was successful in addressing the stated objectives. The transition from a native-dominated riparian plant community to a monoculture of E. camaldulensis over c. 50 years has resulted in marked changes to riparian geomorphology and above-ground vegetation, but has yet to radically change the total soil seed bank and soil nutrient concentrations. The findings offer support to the WfW clearing initiatives and show that potential for recovery of native species after removal of the invasive eucalypts still exists. This knowledge not only enhances effectiveness of restoration and long term management of riparian ecosystems, but also advances the field of riparian ecology and restoration. Further experimental work is needed to establish the mechanisms responsible for the changes associated with Eucalyptus invasion. The contribution of agriculture in shaping channel morphology also needs to be investigated. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die langtermyn stabiliteit van ekosisteme wêreldwyd word bedreig deur uitheemse indringer plante (UIPs) wat, onder andere, die geomorfologie, bo-grondse plantegroei, onder-grondse saadbanke en voedingstofstatus van ekosisteme kan verander. In baie gevalle word bestuursoperasies vir indringer plante vereis, en sluit onder andere herstel (restorasie) in. Die invloed van UIPs op inheemse ekosisteme word wyd erken, maar kennis oor oewerbank-habitatte, in vergeleke met ander terrestriële ekosisteme, skiet steeds tekort. Oewerbank-habitatte is inherent ryk aan biodiversiteit maar uiters sensitief vir indringing deur UIPs. Dit is weens die dinamiese aard van hierdie ekosisteme asook vele menslike aktiwiteite in hierdie tipe habitat. Dit dra by tot die vermeerdering van UIPs, veral bome wat byvoorbeeld insluit Tamarix (tamariske) (bv. in die suid-wes van die Verenigde State van Amerika), Salix (wilger) (in bv. Australië) en die Australiese Acacia (wattel) en Eucalyptus spesies (bloekom) in Suid Afrika. Inisiatiewe soos die Werk vir Water (WvW) program in Suid Afrika fokus juis daarop om UIPs vanuit oewerbank areas te verwyder, en alhoewel groot sukses in die kort termyn behaal is, is die herstel van ekosisteme steeds beperk. Daar is dus min inligting beskikbaar oor die impak van indringer bome en gevolglik ook oor geleenthede vir die herstel van hierdie ekosisteme. My tesis ondersoek die impak van die wydverspreide voorkoms van die indringer, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, in oewerbank-omgewings. Beperkte metodes is tans beskikbaar om die impak van indringer plante te ondersoek, en dit is geïdentifiseer as een van die oorsake vir die beperkte sukses van herstelprojekte. Baie studies ondersoek die effekte van UIPs deur natuurlike areas sonder enige indringer plante te vergelyk met areas waar UIPs voorkom. Hierdie tipe benadering kan ongelukkig, in meeste gevalle, nie onderskei tussen die oorsaak en die impak nie. ŉ Alternatiewe voorstel is om UIPs eksperimenteel te verwyder, maar is ongelukkig nie van toepassing op groot bome nie weens die tyd en kostes verbonde hieraan. Ek het gebruik gemaak van ŉ vergelykende-gradiënt benadering wat steekproefnemings langs ŉ geleidelike kontinuum van natuurlike areas sonder enige indringer plante na areas wat effens gematig, en erg ingedring is (hiernaas bekend as die indringer-gradiënt) deur die indringer, E. camaldulensis. Die steekproefnemings van elke kategorie van indringing (geen, effens, gematig en erg) is vier keer herhaal (n = 16). Hierdie benadering het my toegelaat om neigings te identifiseer wat met sekerheid toegeskryf kan word aan die teenwoordigheid van indringers. My studie het ook verder gemik om ŉ omvattende beskrywing van die impak van UIPs in ekosisteme met indringers te verskaf deur verskeie komponente van die ekosisteem, sowel as hul terugvoer-verhoudinge, in ag te neem, en sodoende die totale effek op ekosisteem prosesse te bepaal. ŉ Oewerbank is ŉ unieke ekosisteem wat ŉ geleentheid bied vir ŉ veelsydige studie wat die impakte van indringer bome op oewerbank-geomorfologie, bo-grond plantegroei, grond saadbanke en grondeienskappe, kan bestudeer en integreer. Ek het die impak van die teenwoordigheid van die indringer, E. camaldulensis in oewerbank areas langs die Bergrivier, wat ŉ Meditereense-tipe klimaat het, in die Wes Kaap, Suid Afrika, bestudeer. My studie het die volgende vrae gevra: 1) Is omgewings-omstandighede (bv. die oewerbank-omgewing geskep deur geomorfologiese prosesse) verander deur die teenwoordigheid van die Eucalyptus indringing, en indien wel, is hierdie omstandighede minder geskik vir inheemse spesies?; 2) Het die indringing van Eucalyptus gelei tot ŉ verandering in die samestelling van inheemse spesie gemeenskappe (moontlik beperkte plant voorplantings materiaal nadat die indringer verwyder is) ?; 3) Hoe verander die indringing van Eucalyptus die samestelling van saad teenwoordig in die grond (saad bank) van die oewerbank en het dit die potensiaal om ekosisteem-herstel weer aan die gang te sit?; 4) Verander indringer Eucalyptus grond eienskappe (fisies en chemies) ? Data vir al vier vrae is by dieselfde plek versamel om vergelykings te kan tref. Vir die eerste vraag het ek fotogrammetrie-tegnieke in ŉ Geografiese Inligting Stelsel (GIS) en afstandwaarnemings-omgewing toegepas om herhaalde lugfotos (1938 - 2010) te analiseer om die indringings geskiedenis sowel as die oewerbank se geomorfologiese evolusionêre dinamika saam te stel. Vir die tweede en derde vraag, het ek die aantal, diversiteit, gelykheid en samestelling van die bo-grond en saad bank plantegroei tussen natuurlike (geen indringers) en die gradiënt met indringers vergelyk. Vir die vierde en laaste vraag, het ek ŉ stel veranderlikes wat die fisies-chemiese eienskappe van die natuurlike omgewing sonder indringers beskryf, vergelyk met die eienskappe van die indringers gradiënt op ŉ seisoenale basis. Die resultate van die geomorfologiese studie wys dat die oewerbank omgewing baie dinamies was oor die afgelope 70 jaar met ŉ totale afname van 13. 5 % in rivieroewer-area in die gebied wat bestudeer is. Daar is ook bewyse vir ŉ vernouing van die kanaal, toename in die steilte van die rivierbank sowel as insnyding in die rivierbedding in areas wat ernstige indringing ervaar. Daar was geen beduidende neigings in die hidro-meteorologiese data nie. Die studie van die bo-grondse plantegroei het gewys dat die aantal plantspesies, diversiteit en strukturele kenmerke (bv. hoogte, dekking en gemiddelde basale diameter) van inheemse spesies afneem soos wat die indringings gradiënt toeneem. Indringing verander ook die inheemse sowel as uitheemse plant spesies samestelling. Beide inheemse en uitheemse spesies het areas wat slegs effense indringing wys, verkies. ŉ Studie van die saad bank (aantal sade in die grond) het gewys dat die indringer, E. camaldulensis geen merkwaardige invloed op die aantal, diversiteit en gelykheid van die totale en inheemse spesies teenwoordig gehad het nie. Die aantal uitheemse spesies was merkwaardig meer as die aantal inheemse spesies. Alhoewel indringing ook die samestelling van die inheemse saadbank beïnvloed het, was die inheemse saad bank, waarvan sommige spesies slegs daar voorgekom het, meer divers as die bo-grond plant samestellings. ŉ Studie van die grond het gewys dat die pH vlakke, afgesien van die seisoen, aansienlik laer is in die areas met indringers in vergeleke met areas sonder die indringers. Die hoeveelheid en dikte van plantmateriaal op die grond neem ook toe met ŉ toename in indringers. Die waterinhoud van die grond het afgeneem met ŉ toename in indringers en temperatuur het verhoog in beide winter en lente. Die totale makro- en mikrovoedingstowwe het nie merkwaardig gewissel saam met die indringingsgradiënt nie (p > 0. 05), maar die uitruilbare katioon inhoud was aansienlik hoër, veral in die winter en lente-maande, in die areas sonder indringers in vergelyking met die areas met indringers. Vernouing van rivierkanaal en versteiling van rivieroewers verminder die geskiktheid van die oewersone om sekere ekologiese funksies te verrig soos grond-saadstoring en die verskaffing van ruimte vir plante om te groei. Dit verminder geleenthede vir werwing van saailinge en verminder gevolglik spesiediversiteit. Aan die ander kant, die vermindering van die spesiediversiteit in die bogrondse plantegroei verminder saadinsette in die grond en dit lei tot verarming van grondgestoorde saadbanke. Die oorvloed van sade van Acacia mearnsii in die grondgestoorde saadbank hou die bedreiging van sekondêre indringing in na die skoonmaak van E. camaldulensis indien dit wel as 'n bestuursaksie aangeneem word. Hierdie studie het die uiteengesette doelwitte suksesvol aangespreek. Die oorgang van ŉ oewerbank-gemeenskap wat hoofsaaklik uit inheemse plante bestaan na ŉ gemeenskap wat slegs uit E. camaldulensis bestaan, oor ŉ periode van ongeveer 50 jaar, het duidelike veranderinge tot gevolg gehad. Hierdie veranderinge is veral opmerklik in die oewerbank-geomorfologie en bo-grondse plantegroei, maar tot op hede is dit nog nie so opmerklik in die saadbank en grond-voedingstowwe konsentrasies nie. Hierdie bevindinge bied ondersteuning aan die WvW verwyderings-ondernemings en wys dat daar wel moontlike herstel van inheemse spesies kan wees na die verwydering van die indringer Eucalyptus. Hierdie kennis dra nie net by tot verhoogde effektiwiteit van herstelwerk en langtermyn-bestuursplanne nie, maar ook tot die navorsingsveld van oewerbankekologie en-herstel. Verdere eksperimentele navorsing word benodig om die moontlike meganismes wat verantwoordelik is vir die waargeneemde veranderinge, geassosieerd met Eucalyptus indringing, te verduidelik. Die bydrae van landbou tot die vorming van kanaal morfologie moet ook verder bestudeer word...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new syntax-directed translation device called top-down tree-to-graph transducer. Such transducers {{are very similar to}} the usual (total deterministic) top-down tree transducers except that the right-hand sides of their rules are hypergraphs rather than trees. Since we are aiming at a device which also allows us to translate trees into objects different from graphs, we focus our attention on so-called tree-generating top-down tree-to-graph transducers. Then the result of every computation is a hypergraph which represents a tree, and in its turn the tree can be interpreted in any algebra of appropriate signature. Although for both devices, top-down tree transducers and tree-generating top-down tree-to-graph transducers, the translation of a subtree of an input tree does not depend on its context, the latter trans-ducers have much more transformational power than the former. In this paper we prove that tree-generating top-down tree-to-graph transducers are equivalent to (<b>total</b> deterministic) <b>macro</b> tree transducers, which are transducers for which the translation of a subtree may depend upon its context. We also prove that tree-generating top-down tree-to-graph transducers are closed under regular look-ahead...|$|R

40|$|We {{assume the}} reader to be very {{familiar}} with the theory of tree transducers [Eng 77, Bak 79, EV 85]. The goal of this note is the following theorem. Theorem 1. 1. Let f ∈ DtMTT ∗, i. e., f is a tree-to-tree function that can be expressed by a finite composition of <b>total</b> deterministic <b>macro</b> tree transducers. Then, ∃c ∈ N. ∀t ∈ range(f). ∃s ∈ dom(f). f(s) = t ∧ |s | ≤ c|t| where |s | and |t | denotes the number of nodes in s and t, respectively. We denote by ∃LBI (existentially linearly-bounded-input) the class of translations satisfying the property in the theorem. Hence, the theorem statement can be written as follows: DtMTT ∗ ⊆ ∃LBI. Let us {{take a look at}} an example. Consider the following translation f f(a(x 1)) = f(x 1) f(b(x 1, x 2)) = c(f(x 1)) f(e) = d and the tree t = c(d). What is the input tree s that makes f to output t? There are many possibilities, because f is not injective. Some of them are large (e. g., a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(a(b(a(a(a(a(a(e))))), e)))))))))))), and some are not. In fact, the smallest one b(e, e) is not so large compared to the given tree t. Mor...|$|R

40|$|Studying data {{attached}} to census tracts such as population along time often brings a difficulty: these areal units can {{change from a}} census to another one. A {{solution to this problem}} is to spatialize the tracts population of a census and reaggregate this spatialized data using the geographical definition for the tracts of the other census. Despite being simple, this solution needs to assume the spatial distribution of the population over the tract area is homogeneous. This paper proposes an alternative to make population data {{attached to}} different census tracts compatible. The idea is to spatialize the tracts population using orbital images by regression linear models. Since the involved pixels datasets are often big, a fraction of the pixels in each tract is sampled {{to be used in the}} regression model. We have studied the influence of this fraction on the quality of the population estimates attached to the new census tracts. Using the whole dataset to spatialize the population, the proposed procedure has overestimated the total population by 3. 4 % and the absolute error at the tracts level has been 1. 9 % (median value). For sample fractions lower than 75 %, this approach tends to overestimate the <b>total</b> population (<b>macro</b> level) as well as the tract population (micro level). However, the greater the sample fraction, the smaller and more homogeneous the error at micro level. Therefore, when the most part of the dataset can be used, we consider the proposed procedure a good alternative to make population compatible over different tracts definitions. Pages: 952 - 95...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{integrates}} a {{model of}} agency cost with time varying uncertainty into an otherwise standard Dynamic New Keynesian model in order to capture a "credit-uncertainty cycle" in the model economy. Deterioration in credit conditions ampli…es the aggregate uncertainty of the economy; rising uncertainty further aggravates the information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers, worsens credit conditions and eventually cause more damage than the initial shock. In our model, uncertainty emerges from the volatility in the idiosyncratic productivity of an economic agent (micro uncertainty) {{as well as in}} the <b>total</b> factor productivity (<b>macro</b> uncertainty). We describe the time-variant micro and macro uncertainty using stochastic volatility models. In order to obtain independent e¤ects of an uncertainty shock to the economy without interacting with other shocks, we solve our model based on a third-order approximation using perturbation method. We estimate our model using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to identify the credit, uncertainty as well as the other economic shocks and obtain the steady state parameters of the model economy...|$|R

This research aims {{to reveal the}} macro-level social, economic, and environmental impacts of alternative vehicle technologies in the U. S. The studied vehicle technologies are conventional gasoline, hybrid, plug-in hybrid with four different all-electric ranges, and full battery electric vehicles (BEV). In <b>total,</b> 19 <b>macro</b> level sustainability indicators are quantified for a scenario in which electric vehicles are charged through the existing U. S. power grid with no additional infrastructure, and an extreme scenario in which electric vehicles are fully charged with solar charging stations. The analysis covers all life cycle phases from the material extraction, processing, manufacturing, and operation phases to the end-of-life phases of vehicles and batteries. Results of this analysis revealed that the manufacturing phase is the most influential phase in terms of socio-economic impacts compared to other life cycle phases, whereas operation phase is the most dominant phase {{in the terms of}} environmental impacts and some of the socio-economic impacts such as human health and economic cost of emissions. Electric vehicles have less air pollution cost and human health impacts compared to conventional gasoline vehicles. The economic cost of emissions and human health impact reduction potential can be up to 45 % and 35 %, respectively, if electric vehicles are charged through solar charging stations. Electric vehicles have potential to generate income for low and medium skilled workers in the U. S. In addition to quantified sustainability indicators, some sustainability metrics were developed to compare relative sustainability performance alternative passenger vehicles. BEV has the lowest greenhouse gas emissions and ecological land footprint per $ of its contribution to the U. S. GDP, and has the lowest ecological footprint per unit of its energy consumption.

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with brittle‑fracture behaviour of grey cast iron attacked by corrosion {{and its impact on}} the life cycle of a spare part made of grey cast iron. In a corrosion chamber, outdoor climatic conditions (temperature and relative air humidity) were simulated in which degradation processes, induced by material corrosion, degrading mechanical properties of a material and possibly leading to irreversible damage of a machine component, occur in the material of maintenance vehicles that are out of operation for the period of one year. The corrosion degradation of grey cast iron, which the spare parts constituting functional parts of an engine are made of grey cast iron, is described with regard to brittle‑fracture behaviour of the material. For the description of corrosion impact on grey cast iron, an instrumented impact test was employed. A corrosion degradation effect on grey cast iron was identified based on measured values of <b>total</b> energy, <b>macro</b> plastic deformation limit, initiation force of unstable crack propagation and force exerted on unstable crack arrest.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood institute Growth and Health Study (NGHS) a multicenter collaborative study of risk factors for obesity, developed an instrument for measuring emotion-induced eating in children and tested hypotheses regarding the association of emotion-induced eating with food intake and adiposity in preadolescent children. Method: Subjects were 1, 213 black girls and 1, 166 white girls who were 9 and 10 at study entry. Baseline data were utilized in this report. Girls were assessed by trained female health examiners who recorded height, weight, and indices of sexual maturation. Girls kept a 3 -day food diary. Dietary data were coded and analyzed for <b>total</b> caloric and <b>macro</b> nutrient intake. A measure of emotion-induced eating was derived from seven questions about eating in response to emotions (Cronbach's alpha =. 78). Results: Black girls had significantly higher emotion-induced eating scores than white girls (10. 8 vs. 9. 7, P <. 0001). For white girls, but not for black girls, emotion-induced eating was associated with increased intake of sucrose.
