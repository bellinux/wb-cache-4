25|$|Abramoff and his partner, Michael Scanlon (a former Tom DeLay aide), {{conspired to}} bilk Native casino {{gambling}} interests {{out of an}} estimated $85 million in fees. <b>The</b> <b>lobbyists</b> also orchestrated lobbying against their own clients in order {{to force them to}} pay for lobbying services. These practices were the subject both of long-running criminal prosecution and hearings by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. On November 21, 2005, Scanlon pleaded guilty to conspiring to bribe a member of Congress and other public officials.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a model of}} legislative decision-making, in which information must be collected from a strategic <b>lobbyist.</b> <b>The</b> legislature appoints a committee to communicate with <b>the</b> <b>lobbyist</b> and propose a bill, and determines whether the proposal is processed under open or closed rule. Consistent with empirical evidence, it can be optimal for the legislature to appoint a biased committee and, depending on <b>the</b> <b>lobbyist</b> 2 ̆ 7 s bias, both open and closed rule are used in equilibrium. For small lobbyist bias, it is optimal to choose closed rule and a committee whose interests are perfectly aligned with <b>the</b> <b>lobbyist</b> 2 ̆ 7 s. For intermediate lobbyist bias, closed rule remains optimal with a committee whose preferences lie between those of the legislature and those of <b>the</b> <b>lobbyist.</b> For large lobbyist bias, open rule and a committee biased against <b>the</b> <b>lobbyist</b> become optimal...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{interacting}} multiple choices of opinions. At {{each step of the}} process, a listener is persuaded by his/her neighbour, <b>the</b> <b>lobbyist,</b> to modify his/her opinion on two different choices of event. Whether or not the listener will be convinced by <b>the</b> <b>lobbyist</b> depends on <b>the</b> difference between his/her opinion with that of <b>the</b> <b>lobbyist,</b> and with that of the revealed social opinion (the social pressure). If the listener is convinced, he/she will modify his/her opinion and update his/her revealed preference, and proceed to persuade his/her next neighbour. If the listener is not convinced by <b>the</b> <b>lobbyist,</b> he/she will retain his/her revealed preference, and try to persuade <b>the</b> <b>lobbyist</b> to change his/her opinion. In this case, the direction of opinion propagation is reversed. A consensus is reached when all the revealed preference is the same. Our numerical results show that consensus can always be attained in this model. However, the time needed to achieve consensus, or the so-called convergence time, is longer if the listener is more concerned with the public opinion, or is less likely to be influenced by <b>the</b> <b>lobbyist.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures.

25|$|In July 2006 the Alabama-Coushatta sued {{lobbyist}} Jack Abramoff and {{his associates}} for attempts to defraud the tribe in seeking to defeat state legislation in 2001 {{that would have given}} them authority to run the casino. The tribe claimed <b>the</b> <b>lobbyists</b> had hidden their motives in representing the competing Coushatta of Louisiana, which ran their own casino, and mobilized Christian groups in an underhanded way. A Senate investigation in 2006 revealed that several tribes were defrauded of {{tens of millions of dollars}} by Abramoff and associates on issues associated with Indian gaming.|$|E
500|$|Florida still {{receives}} a thousand new residents daily and lands slated for restoration and wetland recovery are often {{bought and sold}} before {{the state has a}} chance to bid on them. The competitive pricing of real estate also drives it beyond the purchasing ability of the state. Because the State of Florida is assisting with purchasing lands and funding construction, some of the programs under CERP are vulnerable to state budget cuts. In June 2008 Governor Crist announced that the State of Florida will buy U.S. Sugar for $1.7billion. The idea came when sugar lobbyists were trying to persuade Crist to relax restriction of U.S. Sugar's practice of pumping phosphorus-laden water into the Everglades. According to one of <b>the</b> <b>lobbyists</b> who characterized it as a [...] "duh moment", Crist said, [...] "If sugar is polluting the Everglades, and we're paying to clean the Everglades, why don't we just get rid of sugar?" [...] The largest producer of cane sugar in the U.S. will continue operations for six years, and when ownership transfers to Florida, [...] of the Everglades will remain undeveloped to allow it to be restored to its pre-drainage state.|$|E

A labor representative, Gunter is totally unintimidated by any form of arm-twisting, from gubernatorial on down. When not disposing of legislative garbage, he takes care of mundane local bills for his police jury and school board—unglamorous chores that he takes very seriously." ...|$|E

Earlier, {{the board of trustees}} had placed newspaper advertisements inviting architectural plans in line with a building costing between $85,000 and $120,000. [...] From this search, the board had initially adopted plans drawn up by the Helena firm of McKay and Hemle. This decision did not remain in plan for long, due to the lobbying by individuals who had visited the University of Illinois previously by the selection of the board to investigate similar land grant universities. <b>The</b> <b>lobbyists</b> had returned with flattering drawings and descriptions of school's university hall and had quickly won over the board. The design by McKay and Hemle was dropped, and the board purchased a copy of the Illinois building plans, designed by Chicago architect John M. Van Osdel for $1,000.|$|E

40|$|We examine lobby {{influence}} on policy outcomes in a legislative vote-buying model with two competing lobbyists and endogenous policy proposals. We compare two polar cases: (1) the committee or (2) <b>the</b> <b>lobbyist</b> seeking policy change writes the bill. Surprisingly {{we find that}} if the salience of the issue is low, the committee proposes more extreme policy changes than <b>the</b> pro-policy-change <b>lobbyist</b> even though <b>the</b> policy preferences of the committee are more moderate. The opposite is true if salience is high. We also show that the extreme proposals when salience is low do not necessarily involve lower welfare relative to <b>the</b> <b>lobbyist's</b> proposal...|$|R
