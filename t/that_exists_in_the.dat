5|$|At {{the funeral}} parlour, Rose wakes up {{along with the}} newly-reanimated corpses of Mrs. Peace and Mr. Redpath. The Doctor and Dickens arrive and break into the parlour {{just in time to}} rescue Rose. After hearing about the trouble with the corpses, the Doctor convinces Gwyneth to help him hold a séance to attempt to {{communicate}} with the dead. The blue vapors fill the room and reveal that they are the remains of the Gelth, a once-corporeal alien race until they were devastated by the Time War. They plead with the Doctor to open the rift <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basement of the parlour and allow them to cross over. The Doctor offers the Gelth temporary use of the corpses until he can transport them to a place where they can build new bodies, using Gwyneth as a bridge to cross the Rift.|$|E

25|$|In animal models, {{researchers}} have shown monkeys with damage {{to both the}} hippocampus and its adjacent cortical regions were more severely impaired in terms of anterograde amnesia than monkeys with damage localized to hippocampal structures. However, conflicting data in another primate study point to the observation {{that the amount of}} tissue damaged does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the memory loss. Furthermore, the data do not explain the dichotomy <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MTL memory system between episodic memory and semantic memory (described below).|$|E
25|$|Most {{promoting}} pieces {{promote to}} a piece <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> initial setup of the board. However, such a promoted piece cannot then promote a second time as its namesake does. For example, a lion promotes to a furious fiend. However, while an eastern barbarian promotes to a lion on its first capturing move, it does not further promote to a furious fiend on its second. Rather, it remains a lion {{for the rest of}} the game. This should be obvious from the game pieces, which only have two sides.|$|E

For its first two years, the fest was organized in the transit Campus. The year 2014 will see for the first time, the fest moving to the permanent campus at Kamand, Mandi.

25|$|The {{intertidal}} and benthic estuary {{is presently}} dominated by mudflats that are largely {{the result of}} sedimentation derived from gold mining in the Sierra Nevada in the late 19th century. The trend toward high sediment loads was reversed in the 1950s {{with the advent of}} the Central Valley Project, locking up most sediment behind dams, and resulting in an annual net loss of sediments from the estuary. Thus the mudflats appear to be slowly receding, although turbidity remains extremely high. The high turbidity of the water is responsible for the unique condition <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> San Francisco Estuary wherein high nutrient availability does not lead to high phytoplankton production. Instead, most algae photosynthetic organisms are light-limited.|$|E
25|$|People who tan {{in order}} to get a darker skin {{complexion}} to (especially the females) are considered blackfacers. These Japanese men and women tend to embrace their assumed skin color and party with black people, especially African American soldiers and Africans who have moved to Japan. The use of blackface is seen by some as a way to rebel against the culture of surface images in Japan. Blackface is used as a way to connect with African-Americans and the hegemonic racial structure <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. Japan is seen as a homogenous and insular group, and the use of blackface shows that the youth of Japan are not only concerned with Japanese issues, but issues on a global level.|$|E
25|$|Hunting may be {{threatening}} {{populations of}} the tapir (Tapirus terrestris) and large primates in the north. Some habitat is threatened by expansion of the agricultural and pastoral frontier, gold mining, and selective logging that erodes the genetic diversity of a few valuable timber species. The economically important palm Euterpe precatoria is being depleted in some areas by unsustainable palm heart extraction. A dramatic problem <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian State of Acre and in the adjacent area of Peru is {{the spread of the}} invasive Guadua bamboo forests. This highly competitive bamboo invades and dominates abandoned clearings and threatens to dominate the disturbed areas in this region. Logging along major rivers and near urban centers has decimated populations of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), tropical cedar (Cedrela odorata), and kapok (Ceiba pentandra).|$|E

25|$|A {{limited number}} of cases have been {{described}} in which patients with damage {{to other parts of}} the brain acquired anterograde amnesia. Easton and Parker observed damage to either the hippocampus or the surrounding cortices does not seem to result in severe amnesia in primate models. They suggested damage to the hippocampus and surrounding structures alone does not explain the amnesia they saw in patients, or increasing damage does not correlate with the degree of impairment. Furthermore, the data do not explain the dichotomy <b>that</b> <b>exists</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MTL memory system between episodic and semantic memory. To demonstrate their hypothesis, they used a primate model with damage to the basal forebrain. They proposed that the disruption of neurons that project from the basal forebrain to the MTL are responsible for some of the impairment in anterograde amnesia. Easton and Parker also reported MRI scans of patients with severe anterograde amnesia showed damage beyond to cortical areas around the hippocampus and amygdala (a region of brain involved in emotions) and to surrounding white matter (white matter in the brain consists of axons, long projections of neuronal cell bodies).|$|E
