5000|$|In the 1960s, Fugard {{formed the}} Serpent Players, whose name derives {{from their first}} venue, the former snake pit at the zoo, [...] "a group of black actors worker-players who earned their living as teachers, clerks, and {{industrial}} workers, and cannot thus be considered amateurs {{in the manner of}} leisured whites", developing and performing plays [...] "under surveillance of the Security Police according to Loren Krugers The Dis-illusion of Apartheid published in 2004." [...] The group largely consisted of black men, including Winston Ntshona, John Kani, Welcome Duru, Fats Bookholane and Mike Ngxolo as well as Nomhle Nkonyeni and Mabel Magada. They all got together, albeit at different intervals, and decided to do something about their lives using the stage. In 1961 they met Athol Fugard, a white man from Johannesburg, and asked him if he could work with them as he had the theatre know-how, how to use the stage, movements, and everything else. They worked with Athol Fugard since then and that is how the Serpent Players go together. At the time, the group performed anything they could lay their hands on in South Africa as they had no access to any libraries. These included Bertolt Brecht, August Strindberg, Samuel Beckett, William Shakespeare and many other prominent playwrights of the time. In an interview in California, Ntshona and Kani were asked why they were doing the play Sizwe Banzi is Dead, which was considered a highly political and telling story of the South African political landscape at the time. Ntshona answered: “We are just a group of artists who love theatre. And we have every right to open the doors to anyone who wants to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> play and our work. We believe that art is life and conversely, life is art. And no sensible man can divorce one from the other. That’s it. Other attributes are merely labels”. They mainly performed at the St Stephen’s Hall - which has now been turned into a church, and other spaces in and around New Brighton, the oldest Black township in Port Elizabeth. According to Loren Kruger, Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Chicago, the Serpent Players used Brechts elucidation of gestic acting, dis-illusion, and social critique, as well as their own experience of the satiric comic routines of urban African vaudeville, to explore the theatrical force of Brechts techniques, as well as the immediate political relevance of a play about land distribution. Their work on the Caucasian Chalk Circle and, a year later, on Antigone led directly to the creation, in 1966, of what is still 2004 South Africas most distinctive Lehrstück play:The Coat. Based on an incident at one of the many political trials involving the Serpent Players, The Coat dramatized the choices facing a woman whose husband, convicted of anti-apartheid political activity, left her only a coat and instructions to use it.|$|E

We investigate the simplest case, when the physical object merely supplies a cryptographic key which should be extracted from a single (or a set of) measurements. The ``randomness'' of the physical object is guaranteed by physical laws. Whenever the key is needed, it is extracted freshly from the physical object. We identify three important parameters. Under quite natural assumptions on the phase space, we prove a necessary condition these parameters must satisfy; and give examples which show that our condition is tight up to constants.

Books about sustainability, products, definitions, awards, aspects of reuse, political parties and organizations, lobbying groups, companies, scientists, and neighbors; everyone and everything is involved. More specifically, every car company is constantly coming out with the "newer and better" hybrid or "green" vehicle. Cars and products do not matter, however, {{if we do not}} <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> surroundings and, to use an over worn phrase, "increase the green" so that places (neighborhoods, downtowns, streets, sidewalks, and parking lots) work more congruently with people, things (cars, technology, and plant life), and the environment. This thesis looks at the possibility and capability of implementing aspects of urban forestry, a methodology of "re-planting" cities, into an area of Muncie's downtown. Fifty-four square blocks of space in the heart of downtown were studied for parking capacity and green space, as well as how this has changed over time. Case studies from New York, Pennsylvania, California, and Wyoming were studied for the impact of tree and plant life, both aesthetically on a human scale and financially on a practical scale. Percentages and types of green space were studied in comparison to the amount of carbon they were capable of offsetting in relation to the cost of the plant life and maintenance. Books related to urban forestry planning, plant growth, maintenance, and cost were studied to determine the most practical and efficient outcome for an implementation in Muncie. The final part of the study brought together both the research of Muncie's downtown as well as the information found in the case studies and research. Ideas for urban forestry in downtown Muncie include increased green space (both overall and in proportion with parking lot reduction), more/maintenanced walkways, increased number of trees, and porous pavements for parking lot areas; all of which help offset the total carbon footprint of downtown, as well as increase the health of the city and its patrons.
