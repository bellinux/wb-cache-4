50|$|Bacteria can {{incorporate}} DNA {{from many different}} species into their own genetic libraries. Two {{of the most common}} methods involve plasmids and bacteriophages. Incorporation of DNA from plasmids between two bacterial cells usually involves the creation of a pilus. One bacteria, the donor cell, initiates <b>transmition</b> by extending the pilus to connect with the acceptor cell. The DNA from the plasmid is cut by an endonuclease and a single strand is transferred to the donor cell. Both cells replicate the single strand into a double strand. Plasmids can become incorporated into the full bacterial chromosome. The restriction sites still exist, meaning various lengths of DNA can be transposed from one cell to another directly from the chromosome. In this way non plasmid bacterial genes neighboring the plasmid genes can also migrate from cell to cell.|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} variety of service types {{supported by the}} communication network, more and more requirements for bandwidth occurred. Different types of services have different characteristics in the aspects of importance, bandwidth demand, time-sensitive and so on.

The paper researches on policy-based <b>transmition</b> control technology in MPLS controllable and manageable communication network, proposes a new <b>transmition</b> control method. The method supports to create and to release the dynamical connection of MPLS TE or MPLS LSP, uses service-priority policy, bandwidth policy and degradation policy for policy decision. In order to improve the QoS of service-priority policy, Policy-Condition Maximum Matching Algorithm (PCMMA) is put forward. The principle of the policy-based <b>transmition</b> control in the MPLS communication network is explained. An experiment is performed to support the research. The experiment results show that the policy-based <b>transmition</b> control technology in MPLS communication network is effective and valid.
