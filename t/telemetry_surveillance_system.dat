25|$|Public Health <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> can be passive or active. A passive <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> {{consists}} of the regular, ongoing reporting of diseases and conditions by all health facilities in a given territory. An active <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> is one where health facilities are visited and health care providers and medical records are reviewed {{in order to identify}} a specific disease or condition. Passive <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> are less time consuming and less expensive to run but risk under-reporting of some diseases.

40|$|Objectives: Due {{to reports}} of {{substandard}} influenza preparedness, {{the country of}} Georgia developed two influenza <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper describes these <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> in their capacity to detect influenza. Methods: Two <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> for influenza operate in Georgia: an influenza-like illness (ILI) sentinel <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> for out-patient cases, based in the capital, Tbilisi, and a severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) sentinel <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> for in-patient cases with five sentinel sites â one in Tbilisi, and four in Kutaisi. Patients in these <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> provide samples for laboratory testing, including influenza confirmation. Results: From 2015 - 2016, 825 cases were surveilled in the ILI <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> and 1367 cases were surveilled in the SARI <b>surveillance</b> <b>system,</b> with 222 (26. 9 %) and 451 (33. 0 %) positive for influenza, respectively. Influenza positivity varied by age with adults 30 - 64 years having highest proportion of influenza-positive cases at 42. 2 %. Conclusions: The sensitivity of the <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> to influenza was relatively high compared to neighboring countries. These findings show the importance of influenza surveillance {{in the country of}} Georgia. Keywords: Surveillance, Influenza, Severe acute respiratory illnes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Emerging and re-emerging {{infectious}} diseases {{are a significant}} public health concern, and early detection and immediate response is crucial for disease control. These challenges {{have led to the}} need for new approaches and technologies to reinforce the capacity of traditional <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> for detecting emerging {{infectious diseases}}. In the last few years, the availability of novel web-based data sources has contributed substantially to infectious disease surveillance. This study explores the burgeoning field of web-based infectious disease <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> by examining their current status, importance, and potential challenges. Methods A systematic review framework was applied to the search, screening, and analysis of web-based infectious disease <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems.</b> We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases to extensively review the English literature published between 2000 and 2015. Eleven <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> were chosen for evaluation according to their high frequency of application. Relevant terms, including newly coined terms, development and classification of the <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems,</b> and various characteristics associated with the systems were studied. Results Based on a detailed and informative review of the 11 web-based infectious disease <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems,</b> it was evident that these systems exhibited clear strengths, as compared to traditional <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems,</b> but with some limitations yet to be overcome. The major strengths of the newly emerging <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> are that they are intuitive, adaptable, low-cost, and operated in real-time, all of which are necessary features of an effective public health tool. The most apparent potential challenges of the web-based systems are those of inaccurate interpretation and prediction of health status, and privacy issues, based on an individual’s internet activity. Conclusion Despite being in a nascent stage with further modification needed, web-based <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> have evolved to complement traditional national <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems.</b> This review highlights ways in which the strengths of existing systems can be maintained and weaknesses alleviated to implement optimal web <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{increased}} security risk {{in society and}} the availability of low cost sensors and processors has expedited the research in <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems.</b> Visual <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> provide real time monitoring of the environment. Designing an optimized <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> for a given application is a challenging task. Moreover, the choice of components for a given surveillance application out of a wide spectrum of available products is not an easy job.   In this report, we formulate a taxonomy to ease the design and classification of <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> by combining their main features. The taxonomy is based on three main models: behavioral model, implementation model, and actuation model. The behavioral model helps to understand the behavior of a surveillance problem. The model is a set of functions such as detection, positioning, identification, tracking, and content handling. The behavioral model can be used to pinpoint the functions which are necessary for a particular situation. The implementation model structures the decisions which are necessary to implement the surveillance functions, recognized by the behavioral model. It is a set of constructs such as sensor type, node connectivity and node fixture. The actuation model is responsible for taking precautionary measures when a <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> detects some abnormal situation.   A number of <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> are investigated and analyzed on the basis of developed taxonomy. The taxonomy is general enough to handle a vast range of <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems.</b> It has organized the core features of <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> at one place. It may be considered an important tool when designing <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems.</b> The designers can use this tool to design <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> with reduced effort, cost, and time...|$|R

40|$|Background: Access to {{good quality}} {{information}} from injury surveillance {{is essential to}} develop and monitor injury prevention activities. To determine if information obtained from surveillance is of high quality, the limitations and strengths of a <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> are often examined. Guidelines {{have been developed to}} assist in evaluating certain types of <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems.</b> However, to date, no standard guidelines have been developed to specifically evaluate an injury <b>surveillance</b> <b>system.</b> The aim of this research is to develop a framework to guide the evaluation of injury <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems.</b> Methods: The development of an Evaluation Framework for Injury <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Systems</b> (EFISS) involved a four stage process. First, a literature review was conducted to identify an initial set of characteristics that were recognised as important and/or had been recommended to be assessed in an evaluation of a <b>surveillance</b> <b>system.</b> Second, this set of characteristics was assessed using SMART criteria. Third, those surviving were presented to an expert panel using a two round modified-Delphi study to gain an alternative perspective on characteristic definitions, practicality of assessment, and characteristic importance. Finally, a rating system was created for the EFISS characteristics. Results: The resulting EFISS consisted of 18 characteristics that assess three areas of an injury <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> - five characteristics assess data quality, nine characteristics assess the system's operation, and four characteristics assess the practical capability of an injury <b>surveillance</b> <b>system.</b> A rating system assesses the performance of each characteristic. Conclusion: The development of the EFISS builds upon existing evaluation guidelines for <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> and provides a framework tailored to evaluate an injury <b>surveillance</b> <b>system.</b> Ultimately, information obtained through an evaluation of an injury data collection using the EFISS would be useful for agencies to recommend how a collection could be improved to increase its usefulness for injury surveillance and in the long-term injury prevention. 14 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Based {{on recent}} {{developments}} in occupational health and a review of industry practices, {{it is argued that}} integrated exposure database and <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> hold considerable promise for improving workplace health and safety. A foundation from which to build practical and effective exposure <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> is proposed based on the integration of {{recent developments in}} electronic exposure databases, the codification of exposure assessment practice, and the theory and practice of public health surveillance. The merging of parallel, but until now largely separate, efforts in these areas into exposure <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> combines unique strengths from each subdiscipline. The promise of exposure database and <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems,</b> however, is yet to be realized. Exposure surveillance practices in general industry are reviewed based on the published literature as well as an Internet survey of three prominent industrial hygiene e-mail lists. Although the benefits of exposure surveillance are many, relatively few organizations use electronic exposure databases, and even fewer have active exposure <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems.</b> Implementation of exposure databases and <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> can likely be improved by the development of systems that are more responsive to workplace or organizational-level needs. An overview of exposure database software packages provides guidance to readers considering the implementation of commercially available systems. Strategies for improving the implementation of exposure database and <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> are outlined. A companion report in this issue on the development and pilot testing of a workplace-level exposure <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> concretely illustrates the application of the conceptual framework proposed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Traffic {{surveillance}} {{has become}} an important topic in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), which is aimed at mon-itoring and managing traffic flow. With the progress in computer vision, video-based <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> have made great advances on traffic surveillance in ITSs. However, the performance of most existing <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> is susceptible to challenging complex traffic scenes (e. g., object occlusion, pose variation, and cluttered background). Moreover, existing related research is mainly on a single video sensor node, which is incapable of addressing the surveillance of traffic road networks. Accordingly, we present {{a review of the}} literature on the video-based vehicle <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> in ITSs. We analyze the existing challenges in video-based <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems</b> for the vehicle and present a general archi-tecture for video <b>surveillance</b> <b>systems,</b> i. e., the hierarchical and networked vehicle surveillance, to survey the different existing and potential techniques.

40|$|IntroductionThe Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) {{implemented}} {{an active}} mortality <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> to enumerate and characterize hurricane-related deaths during Hurricane Ike in 2008. This <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> used established guidelines and case definitions to categorize deaths as directly, indirectly, and possibly related to Hurricane Ike. ObjectiveThe {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate Texas DSHS 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 active mortality <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> using US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s (CDC) <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> evaluation guidelines. MethodsUsing CDC 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s Updated Guidelines for <b>Surveillance</b> <b>System</b> Evaluation, the active mortality <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> of the Texas DSHS was evaluated. Data from the active mortality <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> were compared with Texas vital statistics data for the same time period to estimate the completeness of reported disaster-related deaths. ResultsFrom September 8 through October 13, 2008, medical examiners (MEs) and Justices of the Peace (JPs) in 44 affected counties reported deaths daily by using a one-page, standardized mortality form. The active mortality <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> identified 74 hurricane-related deaths, whereas a review of vital statistics data revealed only four deaths that were hurricane-related. The average time of reporting a death by active mortality surveillance and vital statistics was 14 days and 16 days, respectively. ConclusionsTexas 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s active mortality <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> successfully identified hurricane-related deaths. Evaluation of the active mortality <b>surveillance</b> <b>system</b> suggested that it is necessary to collect detailed and representative mortality data during a hurricane because vital statistics do not capture sufficient information to identify whether deaths are hurricane-related. The results from this evaluation will help improve active mortality surveillance during hurricanes which, in turn, will enhance preparedness and response plans and identify public health interventions to reduce future hurricane-related mortality rates.
