In {{the distribution of}} these seats the Socialist Party and the GreenLeft formed one block, as did the ChristianUnion and the SGP. The GreenLeft-SP alliance got one rest seat, the CDA got two, the PvdA got two, D66 got one and the PVV also got one. This means that these parties are slightly overrepresented in parliament.|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork was {{designed}} by Japanese artist Tadanori Yokoo, who had been creating silkscreen prints on themes of Agharta and the mythical kingdom of Shambhala {{the year before the}} Festival Hall concert; his artwork for Carlos Santana's 1974 Lotus album featured such themes. In the early 1970s, Yokoo had found his growing popularity in Japan distracting and moved to the United States, where he was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> his work published. After returning to Japan, he {{received a phone call from}} Davis, who had seen his art and wanted him to create a cover for the Agharta record. Before designing the cover, Yokoo listened to a preliminary tape of the concert, meditated, and reflected on his reading of Raymond W. Bernard's 1969 book The Hollow Earth. Bernard had written that the city existed in a large cavern in the center of the Earth, while Yokoo said he believed [...] "Agharta could be down there under the sea like Atlantis or even hidden in the jungle like the lost city of El Dorado." [...] He also drew on elements from other Eastern subterranean myths and Afrofuturism in his design. Critics who eventually saw the album's packaging thought he had been inspired instead by the psychedelic drugs popular at the time.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1984, Greg Dyke became TVS Director of Programmes. [...] Dyke {{was brought}} in to {{rejuvenate}} the station, and started to move programming away from its original philosophy of niche arts and science programming, and began producing more entertainment programmes.

60|$|The {{first of}} all English games is making money. That is an all-absorbing game; and we knock each other down oftener in playing at that than at foot-ball, or any other roughest sport; and it is {{absolutely}} without purpose; no one who engages heartily in that game ever knows why. Ask a great money-maker {{what he wants to}} do with his money--he never knows. He doesn't make it to do anything with it. He gets it only that he may get it. 'What will you make of what you have got?' you ask. 'Well, I'll get more,' he says. Just as, at cricket, you get more runs. There's no use in the runs, but <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> them than other people is the game. And there's no use in the money, but to have more of it than other people is the game. So all that great foul city of London there,--rattling, growling, smoking, stinking,--a ghastly heap of fermenting brick-work, pouring out poison at every pore,--you fancy it is a city of work? Not a street of it! It is a great city of play; very nasty play, and very hard play, but still play. It is only Lord's cricket ground without the turf,--a huge billiard table without the cloth, and with pockets as deep as the bottomless pit; but mainly a billiard table, after all.|$|E
6000|$|The box {{was covered}} with a sheet of paper {{perforated}} with holes for purposes of ventilation; for even humming-birds have a little pair of lungs, and need their own little portion of air to fill them, so that they may make bright scarlet little drops of blood to keep life's fire burning in their tiny bodies. Our bird's lungs manufactured brilliant blood, as we found out by experience; for in his first nap he contrived to nestle himself into the cotton of which his bed was made, and <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> it than he needed into his long bill. We pulled it out as carefully as we could, but there came out of his bill two round, bright scarlet, little drops of blood. Our chief medical authority looked grave, pronounced a probable hemorrhage from the lungs, and gave him over at once. We, less scientific, declared that we had only cut his little tongue by drawing out the filaments of cotton, and that he would do well enough in time,--as it afterwards appeared he did, for from that day there was no more bleeding. In the course of the second day he began to take short flights about the room, though he seemed to prefer to return to us; perching on our fingers or heads or shoulders, and sometimes choosing to sit in this way for half an hour at a time. [...] "These great giants," [...] he seemed to say to himself, [...] "are not bad people after all; they have a comfortable way with them; how nicely they dried and warmed me! Truly a bird might do worse than to live with them." ...|$|E
