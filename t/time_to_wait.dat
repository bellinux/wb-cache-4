5|$|This {{fighting}} was so heavy that the NK 8th Division {{was forced to}} hold its ground a week before trying to advance. When it finally broke out, it was only able to advance briefly before it was stalled again by South Korean resistance. The division was forced to halt a second <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for reinforcements. However the other two attacks were more successful, catching the UN forces by surprise. The North Koreans quickly pushed South Korean forces back.|$|E
5|$|The Bird-of-Prey's {{travel through}} time {{was one of}} the most {{difficult}} effects sequences of the film. While ILM was experienced in creating the streaking warp effect they used for previous films, the sequence required the camera to trail a sustained warp effect as the Bird-of-Prey rounded the sun. Matching the effect to the model was accomplished through trial-and-error guesswork. The team did not have the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for the animation department to create the sun for this shot. Assistant cameraman Pete Kozachic devised a way of creating the sun on-stage. He placed two sheets of textured plexiglass next to each other and backlit them with a powerful yellow light. The rig was rotated on a circular track and the sheet in front created a moire pattern as its position shifted. Animator John Knoll added solar flare effects to complete the look; Dow recalled that the effect came close to matching footage of the sun taken by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|These uniforms were officially {{decided by}} edict of the Dajō-kan on December 12, 1872. The Iwakura Mission, which had {{departed}} Japan earlier, also gathered information on uniform design via Hayashi Tadasu. However, the mission had no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> {{for a final}} decision before an audience with Queen Victoria. They therefore ordered uniforms in England, based on the designs they had been discussing with the homeland. Unfortunately, the designs they reported back were determined to be impossible to create in Japan's still-immature Western clothing stores and were not adopted directly. The versions ultimately decreed by the Dajō-kan differed considerably from the Iwakura mission's prototypes. The Dajō-kan's edicts were still incomplete {{as a form of}} law, and the details of the original edict itself were in some areas insufficient, so variations were visible depending on the manufacturer.|$|E

2500|$|The new {{government}} {{would consist of}} a chief executive and a General Council who would share powers. [...] Under the assumption that these two branches would have full cooperation, there was no {{system of checks and}} balances. [...] Believing there was no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> for general elections, the Consultation determined that the governor and lieutenant governor would be chosen by the delegates themselves, a practice somewhat common among states in the United States. Although Austin was nominated, he lost to Smith 3122. James Robinson was elected lieutenant governor. [...] As lieutenant governor, Robinson would preside over the General Council, which would consist of one representative from each municipality.|$|E
2500|$|A patch was {{released}} September 9, 2010 to fix {{issues in the}} game. [...] Players can no longer use collision glitches with the world geometry {{to find ways to}} cheat on the game's leaderboards.

The patch also decreases the amount of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> on players who do not finish multiplayer races. [...] Vector Unit later removed glitched times from the game's leaderboards in November 2010.
