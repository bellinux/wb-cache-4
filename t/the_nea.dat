5|$|The cross-in-square plan, with {{a single}} dome at the {{crossing}} or five domes in a quincunx pattern, became widely popular in the Middle Byzantine period. Examples include an early 9th century church in Tirilye, now called the Fatih Mosque, and the palace chapel of the Myrelaion, built around 920. <b>The</b> <b>Nea</b> Ekklesia of Emperor Basil I was built in Constantinople around 880 {{as part of a}} substantial building renovation and construction program during his reign. It had five domes, which are known from literary sources, but different arrangements for them have been proposed under at least four different plans. One has the domes arranged in a cruciform pattern like those of the contemporaneous Church of St. Andrew at Peristerai or the much older Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. Others arrange them in a quincunx pattern, with four minor domes in the corners of a square and a larger fifth in the center, as part of a cross-domed or cross-in-square plan. It is often suggested that the five-domed design of St. Panteleimon at Nerezi, from 1164, is based on that of <b>the</b> <b>Nea</b> Ekklesia.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, aged 62, he {{was again}} uprooted by the German {{invasion}} of France, and spent {{weeks in a}} refugee camp in Mende. During this time he began attending mass at the cathedral in Mende, a turn towards Christianity that would culminate in his religious conversion the following year. On 3 September 1940 Alfred, Erna, and Stefan boarded <b>the</b> <b>Nea</b> Hellas in Lisbon, reaching New York six days later; in October they moved to Los Angeles. Döblin worked briefly for Metro Goldwyn Mayer writing screenplays for 100 dollars a week, but his contract expired in October 1941 and was not renewed, despite the interventions of Thomas Mann and others. Alfred, Erna, and Stefan were baptized as Roman Catholics in Hollywood's Blessed Sacrament Church on 30 November 1941.|$|E
5|$|Art {{historian}} Josef Strzygowski, who was {{the first}} European to thoroughly study Armenian architecture, and who placed Armenia in the center of European architecture, suggested that several churches and chapels in Western Europe have been influenced by the cathedrals of Etchmiadzin and Bagaran due to similarities found within their plans. According to Strzygowski, some examples of churches influenced by Etchmiadzin and Bagaran are the 9th-century church of Germigny-des-Prés in France (built by Odo of Metz, probably an Armenian) and San Satiro of Milan, Italy. This view was later supported by Alexander Sahinian and Varazdat Harutyunyan. Sahinian suggested that the Armenian church architecture was spread in Western Europe in the 8th–9th centuries by Paulicians, who migrated from Armenia en mase after being suppressed by the Byzantine government during the Iconoclasm period. Sahinian added many other medieval churches in Europe, such as the Palatine Chapel of Aachen in Germany, to the list of churches to have been influenced by the cathedrals of Etchmiadzin and Bagaran and by Byzantine decorative arts. According to Murad Hasratyan, Etchmiadzin's design was spread to Europe via the Byzantine Empire and served as a model—besides Germigny-des-Prés and San Satiro—for <b>the</b> <b>Nea</b> Ekklesia church in Constantinople and the churches of Mount Athos in Greece.|$|E

40|$|Main-belt asteroids and cometary nuclei {{are both}} {{frequently}} suggested {{sources of the}} relatively short-lived near-earth asteroids (<b>NEAs).</b> <b>The</b> asteroidal origin hypothesis is studied by obtaining new high-quality reflectivity spectra of 19 NEAs and 23 asteroids near the 3 : 1 resonance, and by performing a systematic comparison of these two groups of spectra. Nonparametric statistical tests are used to check for consistency between the color distributions of the two populations. The tests indicate {{that the difference between}} the two distributions is generally not significant at the 3 sigma level. However, this conclusion is dependent on the (unknown) size distribution of <b>the</b> <b>NEAs.</b> <b>The</b> observations are compatible with the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>NEAs</b> are derived from the 3 : 1 resonance region, but do not imply that this is the only possible source region...|$|R
5|$|In the West, the Muslims {{continued}} to make steady advances, as the local Byzantine forces proved inadequate: the Empire was forced {{to rely on the}} aid of their nominal Italian subjects, and had to resort to the transfer of the eastern fleets to Italy to achieve any progress. Following the fall of Enna in 855, the Byzantines were confined to the eastern shore of Sicily, and under increasing pressure. A relief expedition in 868 achieved little. Syracuse was attacked again in 869, and in 870, Malta fell to the Aghlabids. Muslim corsairs raided the Adriatic, and although they were driven out of Apulia, in the early 880s they established bases along the western Italian coast, from where they would not be completely dislodged until 915. In 878, Syracuse, the main Byzantine stronghold in Sicily, was attacked again and fell, largely because the Imperial Fleet was occupied with transporting marble for the construction of <b>the</b> <b>Nea</b> Ekklesia, Basil's new church. In 880, Ooryphas' successor, the droungarios Nasar, scored a significant victory in a night battle over the Aghlabids who were raiding the Ionian Islands. He then proceeded to raid Sicily, carrying off much booty, before defeating another Muslim fleet off Punta Stilo. At the same time, another Byzantine squadron scored a significant victory at Naples. These successes allowed a short-lived Byzantine counter-offensive to develop in the West in the 870s and 880s under Nikephoros Phokas the Elder, expanding the Byzantine foothold in Apulia and Calabria and forming the thema of Longobardia, which would later evolve into the Catepanate of Italy. A heavy defeat off Milazzo in 888, however, signalled the virtual disappearance of major Byzantine naval activity in the seas around Italy for the next century.|$|E
