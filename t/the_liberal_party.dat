5|$|Riel's {{execution}} and Macdonald's refusal to commute his sentence caused lasting discord in Quebec, {{and led to}} a fundamental alteration in the Canadian political order.

The federal election of 1887 likewise saw significant gains by the federal Liberals, again {{at the expense of the}} Conservatives. This led to the victory of <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>party</b> under Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the federal election of 1896, which in turn set the stage for the domination of Canadian federal politics by <b>the</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>party</b> in the 20th century.|$|E
