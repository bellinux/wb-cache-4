5|$|Coinciding {{with this}} {{cultural}} reemergence was {{the establishment of}} the Istanbul Festival, which began showcasing a variety of art from Turkey and around the world in 1973. From this flagship festival came the International Istanbul Film Festival and the Istanbul International Jazz Festival in the early 1980s. With its focus now solely on music and dance, the Istanbul Festival has been known as the Istanbul International Music Festival since 1994. The most prominent of the festivals that evolved from the original Istanbul Festival is the Istanbul Biennial, held every <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> 1987. Its early incarnations were aimed at showcasing Turkish visual art, and it has since opened to international artists and risen in prestige to join the elite biennales, alongside the Venice Biennale and the São Paulo Art Biennial.|$|E

5|$|On February 4, 1600, Kepler met Tycho Brahe and {{his assistants}} Franz Tengnagel and Longomontanus at Benátky nad Jizerou (35km from Prague), {{the site where}} Tycho's new {{observatory}} was being constructed. Over {{the next two months}} he stayed as a guest, analyzing some of Tycho's observations of Mars; Tycho guarded his data closely, but was impressed by Kepler's theoretical ideas and soon allowed him more access. Kepler planned to test his theory from Mysterium Cosmographicum based on the Mars data, but he estimated that the work would take up to <b>two</b> <b>years</b> (<b>since</b> he was not allowed to simply copy the data for his own use). With the help of Johannes Jessenius, Kepler attempted to negotiate a more formal employment arrangement with Tycho, but negotiations broke down in an angry argument and Kepler left for Prague on April 6. Kepler and Tycho soon reconciled and eventually reached an agreement on salary and living arrangements, and in June, Kepler returned home to Graz to collect his family.|$|E
5|$|Realizing his situation, Maroboduus {{requested}} Roman aid. It {{had been}} <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> the Marcommani refused to help Roman against {{the forces of}} Arminius, and so Tiberius refused to send aid. Instead, Tiberius sent Drusus to further Roman interests at Maroboduus' expense as he knew the Marcomanni were vulnerable. During the summer of 18, Drusus received intelligence from a former captive of Maroboduus, Catualda, that Maroboduus was weak and {{that it was a good}} time to attack. Hence, Drusus led a powerful force into the heart of the Marcomanni, and stormed their royal stronghold. Maroboduus fled, but was forced to seek asylum in Rome, which Tiberius granted. Later, Catualda lost a battle against the Hermunduri, and he too was granted asylum. The Senate decreed that Drusus be given an ovation for his success, which he received on his return to Rome on 28 May 20.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} major {{international}} competition for {{track and field}} are organised by the IAAF. The IAAF had selected the Olympic competition as its world championship event in 1913, but a separate world championships for athletics alone was first held in 1983 – the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. The championships comprised track and field competitions plus the marathon and racewalking competitions. Initially, this worked on a quadrennial basis but, after 1991, it changed to a biennial format. In terms of indoor track and field, the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics has been held every <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> 1985 {{and this is the}} only world championships that consists of solely track and field events.|$|E

5|$|The {{state is}} governed by a {{parliamentary}} system of representative democracy. Uttar Pradesh {{is one of the}} seven states in India, where the state legislature is bicameral, comprising two houses: the Vidhan Sabha (Legislative Assembly) and the Vidhan Parishad (Legislative Council). The Legislative Assembly consists of 404 members who are elected for five-year terms. The Legislative Council is a permanent body of 100 members with one-third (33 members) retiring every <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> <b>Since</b> Uttar Pradesh sends the largest number of legislators to the national Parliament, it is often considered {{to be one of the}} most important states with respect to Indian politics. The state contributes 80 seats to the lower house of the Indian Parliament, Lok Sabha and 31 seats to the upper house of the Indian Parliament, Rajya Sabha.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} {{conferences}} on international emergency medicine as well, {{including the one}} that the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine (WADEM) has held every <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> 1987. However, WADEM focuses more on disaster medicine than emergency medicine system development, {{and many of its}} member physicians are not specialists in emergency medicine. Additionally, the European Society for Emergency Medicine (EuSEM) has hosted an annual conference since 1998. EuSEM also publishes The European Journal of Emergency Medicine, develops recommendations for emergency medicine standards for European countries, and supports a disaster medicine training center and degree program in San Marino. The Asian Society for Emergency Medicine (Asian Society), which was founded in 1998, holds its own biennial conference. In addition to that, the Asian Society, like the EuSEM, develops curriculum recommendations for Asian countries.|$|E
5|$|An earlier, longer, {{work-in-progress}} {{version of}} the film was rejected for competition by the Cannes Film Festival, which offered that cut of Mr. Nobody an out-of-competition berth. Producer Philippe Godeau turned that down. The decision by the Cannes Film Festival not to exhibit the film created a national controversy. Eventually, the studio held the film's world premiere at the 66th Venice International Film Festival on 12 September 2009. Six days later, Mr. Nobody screened as a special presentation during the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Additionally, the film was screened at the Sitges Film Festival and the Stockholm International Film Festival before its theatrical release. Mr. Nobody had its American premiere on 25 June 2011, at the Los Angeles Film Festival, nearly <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> its original debut. It was among more than 200 feature films, short projects, and music videos, from more than 30 countries, to be shown at the festival. The Consul General of Belgium, Geert Criel, held a second United States screening of Mr. Nobody on 21 December 2011, at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica.|$|E

5|$|During Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny, Kira {{has been}} living in the secluded Marshall Islands {{since the end of the}} war within the country of Orb. He and Lacus have spent the past <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> the end of the war {{assisting}} Reverend Malchio and Kira's adoptive mother with their orphanage. When an incident triggers another war, Coordinators try to kill Lacus; Kira pilots Freedom to defeat them. When Orb attempts to join the war as a member of the Earth Alliance, Kira and the Arcangel intervene Orb's forces to preserve the nation's neutral status. Kira suspects Gilbert Durandal, the chairman of the PLANT colonies and leader of ZAFT, to be behind Lacus' attempted murder, but his motives are questioned by Athrun who is working in ZAFT. Later, when the Archangel becomes a target of the ZAFT ship known as Minerva, Kira is defeated and the Freedom is destroyed by pilot Shinn Asuka. Lacus gives Kira an upgraded version of Freedom, , so he can continue fighting. Having obtained a weapon of mass destruction, Durandal imposes the Destiny Plan, a rule which removes freewill and dictates a person's entire life based on their genetics. Kira, the Archangel and their allies confront ZAFT's forces in space and defeat them in the final battle. Kira personally confronts Durandal and the latter is killed by one of his own subordinates.|$|E
5|$|During his convalescence, he {{was visited}} by the General der Jagdflieger (General of Fighters), Generalleutnant Adolf Galland, who offered Graf command {{of his old}} unit, JG52. Graf {{accepted}} {{with the proviso that}} his Roten Jäger football team went with him. Once criticized for its low scoring rate early in the war, it was now the pre-eminent Geschwader, with over 10,000 victories. His return was celebrated with a welcome dinner at its headquarters in Kraków, southern Poland, on 20 September 1944. He was officially appointed on 1 October. Ongoing weakness in his left arm kept Graf on the ground. In the <b>two</b> <b>years</b> <b>since</b> he had left the Eastern Front, {{the quantity and quality of}} the Soviet pilots had greatly improved, as had their equipment. For the remainder of the war he oversaw his three separated fighter groups shuttled up and down the front, in emergency responses to each new Soviet offensive. Several times the crews had to evacuate as Soviet tanks and artillery were shelling their airfield. The German fuel crisis severely curtailed the amount of flight-time. Consequently, the November total for the wing of only 369 Soviet aircraft shot down was the lowest monthly total of the eastern campaign. As the winter weather got worse, the lull allowed Graf to organise a football match between his Roten Jäger and a local Kraków team, watched by 20,000 German soldiers.|$|E
