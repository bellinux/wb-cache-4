5|$|As per the {{regulations}} for , three practice sessions were held, two {{one and a}} half-hour sessions on Thursday and another one-hour session on Saturday morning. After a thunderstorm on Wednesday night, {{the first of the}} two free practice sessions held on Thursday morning, started with every driver setting their installation laps on intermediate tyres. The track soon dried up, and the cars changed to slick tyres. Nico Rosberg had an early shunt when he clipped his front wing exiting the <b>Tabac</b> corner though he did not sustain considerable damage to his car. The two Mercedes drivers swapped places {{at the top of the}} time sheets for most of the session, until late improvements pushed Rosberg down the order to finish ninth, more than a second off his team-mate Lewis Hamilton. Rookie Max Verstappen surprised the paddock by finishing second, two-tenths of a second down on Hamilton. The Renault-powered cars all finished within the top seven, while the Williams team ended the session in tenth and seventeenth, owing to the car not being well suited for wet and low-temperature conditions.|$|E

25|$|After taking Friday off—a {{feature of}} the event {{timetable}} unique to Monaco— the drivers returned to action on Saturday in bright weather conditions. All of the leading drivers had trouble getting clear air as they fought for clear space around the narrow circuit which had been made worse by them taking longer than usual to get optium tyre temperature. Despite having difficulties with his car's handling and narrowly avoiding an accident at <b>Tabac</b> corner, Hamilton set the fastest lap of the weekend so far with a late lap of one minute and 16.758 seconds, half of {{a tenth of a}} second quicker than the second-placed Ricciardo. Rosberg was third-fastest; Vettel in the other Red Bull was fourth, with the two Ferrari drivers in fifth and sixth (with Alonso faster than Räikkönen). Pérez was seventh-fastest, Hülkenberg eighth, Vergne ninth and Daniil Kvyat completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Vergne ran off the track at Sainte Dévote and Mirabeau corners. Ericsson went into the Dévote run-off area and reversed to rejoin the track.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} lap, Buemi led di Grassi, Piquet, Vergne, Heidfeld, Engel, Bird, Rosenqvist, Frijns, López, Abt, Evans, Gutiérrez, Turvey, Carroll, Félix da Costa, Prost, d'Ambrosio, Duval and Sarrazin. Buemi began to pull away from di Grassi, {{establishing}} a lead of one second over him. The field settled down for the next six laps with nothing notable of note occurring. On lap eight, Bird went over the kerbing at <b>Tabac</b> corner, lost control of the rear-end of his car, and veered into the barrier, damaging his rear suspension. Bird was forced to make a pit stop, while his teammate López was shown a black flag with an orange circle, requiring him to stop for repairs to his rear wing. Bird's mechanics repaired his vehicle's rear-end with a spanner and replaced López's rear wing. Both drivers returned to the track to commence a battle for the race's fastest lap. Buemi continued to extend his advantage over di Grassi and Piquet while Rosenqvist was challenging Engel for sixth. Frijns lost eighth when Abt passed him around the outside and closed up to the Engel and Rosenqvist battle. Piquet struggled to remain within sight of the leading drivers, and Vergne ran closely behind him, steering left onto the inside line. As both drivers locked their tyres, Piquet clambered with his steering wheel, and both cars made contact; Vergne ended his race in the Novelle Chicane barrier on lap 21.|$|E
25|$|Behind the {{two leading}} runners, Ferrari's {{challenge}} for pole position faded {{during the final}} session. Alesi's car {{ground to a halt}} on his first out-lap of the session after losing hydraulic pressure, and he had to share Berger's chassis for the remainder of qualifying. This forced Berger to hurry through his planned programme, making three runs instead of four, before handing his car over to his teammate. The extensive adjustments required to tailor the car's pedal system from Berger to Alesi's preferred set-up meant that he left the pits with only twominutes and 38seconds of the session remaining. Alesi thus had time for just one flying lap, which was spoiled when Irvine crashed his Jordan at <b>Tabac</b> during the final minutes. As a result, Alesi failed to improve on his Thursday time and dropped to fifthplace on the grid, half a second and oneposition behind Berger. The team's problems allowed Coulthard to improve to third place with a time of 1:23.109, continuing his progress as he became more familiar with the circuit. Häkkinen was another driver to be caught out by Irvine's crash {{at the end of the}} session, restricting him to sixthplace on the grid ahead of Herbert, who was satisfied to qualify only a second behind Schumacher. Blundell rounded out the top ten in the second McLaren, despite going up the escape road after missing his braking point at Sainte Dévote. Brundle took eighth and Irvine ninth despite his crash, which meant that all six of the British drivers qualified in the top ten.|$|E
500|$|Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and {{frontman}} Pete Shelley {{have both}} been credited with suggesting the band name [...] "Stiff Kittens", but settled on [...] "Warsaw" [...] shortly before their first gig, referencing David Bowie's song [...] "Warszawa". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. They received immediate national exposure due to reviews of the gig in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood. Tony <b>Tabac</b> played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Mason was soon made the band's manager and <b>Tabac</b> was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. During his tenure with Warsaw, Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik and even got Curtis to audition for the band. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded a set of five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the demo sessions. Driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; {{when he got out}} of the car, they sped off.|$|E

500|$|Alfa Romeo withdrew its factory {{team from}} motor racing {{at the start}} of the 1933 season, leaving Caracciola without a contract. He was close friends with the Monegasque driver Louis Chiron, who had been fired from Bugatti, and while on {{vacation}} in Arosa in Switzerland the two decided to form their own team, Scuderia C.C. (Caracciola-Chiron). They bought three Alfa Romeo 8Cs (known as Monzas), and Daimler-Benz provided a truck to transport them. Chiron's car was painted blue with a white stripe, and Caracciola's white with a blue stripe. The new team's first race was at the Monaco Grand Prix. On the second day of practice for the race, while Caracciola was showing Chiron around the circuit (it was Chiron's first time in an Alfa Romeo), the German lost control heading into the <b>Tabac</b> corner. Three of the four brakes failed, which destabilised the car. Faced with diving into the sea or smashing into the wall, Caracciola instinctively chose the latter. Caracciola later recounted what happened after the impact: ...|$|E
500|$|Revisions to the <b>Tabac</b> {{corner at}} the harbour {{section of the}} race track meant that the drivers now entered the turn {{slightly}} earlier, shortening the track by [...] compared to previous years, and making the corner slightly tighter and slower. The corner had seen a race-stopping accident involving Pastor Maldonado and Max Chilton in 2013, leading to the changes being made. This resulted in the circuit being officially classified as a new layout. The barrier {{on the right of}} the swimming pool chicane was moved back, with new kerbs, to allow for a better view of the corner. Much of the track was resurfaced before the event. As in Australia and Singapore, the pit lane speed limit {{for the duration of the}} event was reduced to , instead of the standard , due to the confined nature of the circuit. The race schedule for the weekend was different in Monaco compared to the other races on the calendar. The first two free practice sessions were held on Thursday instead of Friday.|$|E
500|$|Nobuharu Matsushita was {{the fastest}} driver not to qualify {{in the top}} ten; his fastest time was two seconds slower than Rossi's pole {{position}} lap. Gasly went deep into Sainte Dévote but did not damage his car en route to qualifying 12th. Artem Markelov followed in 13th, ahead of Stanaway who damaged his front wing in a light collision with the Mirabeau barrier which required him to enter the pit lane for a replacement nose cone. Negrão filled {{the inside of the}} eighth row in 15th, with Zoël Amberg behind him in 16th who aquaplaned off the circuit because of an oversteer and [...] hit the exit <b>Tabac</b> corner barrier heavily, removing his right-rear wheel. The two were followed by Lynn and Evans; the latter overshot the entry into Sainte Dévote but avoided damaging his vehicle. Sørensen's vehicle briefly launched into the air after driving over the kerbs through the swimming pool complex and qualified in 19th position. René Binder and Johnny Cecotto Jr. started from 20th and 21st positions; Cecotto went into Mirabeau's run-off area but avoided damaging his car. Berthon qualified in 22nd and Haryanto was issued with a three-place starting penalty for being unable to slow sufficiently during a yellow flag period in the track's second sector and started from 23rd. Nato, Marlon Stöckinger and Robert Vișoiu were the last of the qualifiers.|$|E

2500|$|The circuit {{underwent}} changes {{following the}} previous year's event. The track underwent a resurfacing from exit of Casino corner until {{the start of}} the tunnel with small areas before the Novelle chicane and <b>Tabac</b> undergoing a similar change. The pit lane barrier and the debris fencing was renewed and the turn 12 TecPro barrier was made more efficiently constrained. Work on the track was carried out during nighttime conditions so that disruption to roadside traffic was minimised. It was predicted by Button that the changes would create a situation similar to the 2012 United States Grand Prix where grip was low for all cars and felt the soft compound tyres would be difficult to get working properly. Pérez said the experience around Monaco would be [...] "difficult" [...] but that [...] "It will be a new Monaco - very, very interesting". Alonso stated the race weekend would be [...] "a question mark for everybody" [...] and that the sport needed to see which team would adapt their car better for the track.|$|E
2500|$|On Duvalier's {{death in}} April 1971, power passed to his 19-year-old son Jean-Claude Duvalier (known as [...] "Baby Doc"). Under Jean-Claude Duvalier, Haiti's {{economic}} and political condition continued to decline, {{although some of the}} more fearsome elements of his father's regime were abolished. Foreign officials and observers also seemed more tolerant toward Baby Doc, in areas such as human-rights monitoring, and foreign countries were more generous to him with economic assistance. The United States restored its aid program in 1971. In 1974, Baby Doc expropriated the Freeport Tortuga project and this caused the venture to collapse. Content to leave administrative matters in the hands of his mother, Simone Ovid Duvalier, while living as a playboy, Jean-Claude enriched himself through a series of fraudulent schemes. Much of the Duvaliers' wealth, amounting to {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} over the years, came from the Régie du <b>Tabac</b> (Tobacco Administration), a tobacco monopoly established by Estimé, which expanded to include the proceeds from all government enterprises and served as a slush fund for which no balance sheets were ever kept. His marriage, in 1980, to a beautiful mulatto divorcée, Michèle Bennett, in a $3million ceremony, provoked widespread opposition, as it was seen as a betrayal of his father's antipathy towards the mulatto elite. At the request of Michèle, Papa Doc's widow Simone was expelled from Haiti. Baby Doc's kleptocracy left the regime vulnerable to unanticipated crises, exacerbated by endemic poverty, most notably the epidemic of African swine fever virus—which, at the insistence of USAID officials, led to the slaughter of the creole pigs, the principal source of income for most Haitians; and the widely publicized outbreak of AIDS in the early 1980s. Widespread discontent in Haiti began in 1983, when Pope John Paul II condemned the regime during a visit, finally provoking a rebellion, and in February 1986, after months of disorder, the army forced Duvalier to resign and go into exile.|$|E

His father Kristo was a lawyer that worked as a legal counselor for the French company La Regie Des <b>Tabacs,</b> which held the monopoly of tobacco in the Ottoman Empire. At the age of nine he moved to Bitola, where his uncle Ilia, a tobacco merchant of the same company, lived. After graduating from the local Greek-language gymnasium, he was hired by La Regie Des <b>Tabacs</b> and worked in their Ohrid branch. In 1896 he worked as a teacher of Albanian language in the Albanian community of Kavala. Between 1899 and 1902 he was transferred to the Drama and Kavala branches of the company.|$|R
