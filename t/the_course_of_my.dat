In <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> commercial career {{it has been my}} fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the last}} few years I've been {{focusing}} a lot of my research on present day anti-Semitism.... In <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> research I began to notice that {{some of the people who}} were voicing some of the harshest hostility were themselves Jews, especially Jews on the radical Left. I wanted to document and try to explain their words, which struck me as often being extreme.|$|E

500|$|Former United States President John Quincy Adams, who at {{the time}} {{represented}} Massachusetts in Congress, backed Michigan's claim. In 1833, when Congress rejected Michigan's request for a convention, Adams summed up his opinion on the dispute: [...] "Never in <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life have I known a controversy of which all the right was so clearly on one side and all the power so overwhelmingly on the other." ...|$|E
500|$|Hitler {{responded to}} the foreign press {{regarding}} the Anschluss by saying: [...] "Certain foreign newspapers have said that we fell on Austria with brutal methods. I can only say: even in death they cannot stop lying. I have in <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> political struggle won much love from my people, but when I crossed the former frontier (into Austria) there met me such a stream of love as I have never experienced. Not as tyrants have we come, but as liberators." ...|$|E
500|$|In <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> journeys, I {{observe that}} I receive upon an average two-thirds {{counterfeit}} halfpence for change at toll-gates, etc. and I believe the evil is daily increasing, as the spurious money is carried into circulation by the lowest class of manufacturers, who pay {{with it the}} principal part of the wages of the poor people they employ. [...] They purchase from the subterraneous coiners 36 shillings'-worth of copper (in nominal value) for 20 shillings, so that the profit derived from the cheating is very large.|$|E

60|$|While, however, I thus in {{some measure}} limit for the present the methods of your practice, I shall {{endeavour}} to make <b>the</b> <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> University lectures as wide in their range as my knowledge will permit. The range so conceded will be narrow enough; but I believe that my proper function is not to acquaint you with the general history, but with the essential principles of art; and with its history only when it has been both great and good, or where some special excellence of it requires examination of the causes to which it must be ascribed.|$|R
2500|$|Heath's autobiography, <b>The</b> <b>Course</b> <b>of</b> <b>My</b> Life, {{appeared}} in 1998. According to his Daily Telegraph obituary this [...] "had involved dozens of researchers and writers (some {{of whom he}} never paid) over many years".|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} day, loyalists expelled 500 Catholic {{workers from}} the nearby Harland and Wolff shipyard.

2500|$|In all his teachings he {{was known}} for {{stressing}} pure motivation in doing spiritual practice.

2500|$|... "I cannot {{allow for}} my private failings {{to disrupt the}} people's work," [...] Spitzer {{said at a news}} conference in Manhattan. [...] "Over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> public life, I have insisted – I believe {{correctly}} – that people take responsibility for their conduct. I can and will ask no less of myself. For this reason, I am resigning from the office of governor." [...] Spitzer's lieutenant governor, David Paterson, succeeded him as governor of New York State and served the remaining 2 3/4 years of Spitzer's four year term.|$|E
2500|$|In his will, Wythe {{left his}} large book {{collection}} to Thomas Jefferson. This {{was part of}} the collection which Jefferson later sold to create the Library of Congress. Jefferson praised Wythe as [...] "my ancient master, my earliest and best friend, and to him I am indebted for first impressions which have [...] the most salutary on <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] However, Jefferson later refused an offer of Wythe's lecture notes and other legal papers, believing they should go instead to what became the Library of Virginia. Last reported either in the possession of Spencer Roane (who burned many papers before his own death) or his ally Thomas Ritchie (publisher of the Richmond Enquirer), they were reported lost by the 1830s.|$|E

2500|$|In Canada, Lee's parents {{gave him}} a Jewish education, with a bar mitzvah at age 13. His father was a skilled musician, but died the year before from medical {{problems}} resulting from his imprisonment. This forced his mother to find outside work to support three children. Lee feels that not having parents at home during those years was probably a factor in his becoming a musician: [...] "It was a terrible blow that I lost him, but <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life changed because my mother couldn't control us." [...] He said that losing his father at such an early age made him aware of how [...] "quickly life can disappear", which inspired him from then on {{to get the most}} out of his life and music.|$|E
2500|$|In 1853 Brahms went on {{a concert}} tour with Reményi. In late May the two visited the violinist and {{composer}} Joseph Joachim at Hanover. Brahms had earlier heard Joachim playing the solo part in Beethoven's violin concerto and been deeply impressed. Brahms played {{some of his own}} solo piano pieces for Joachim, who remembered fifty years later: [...] "Never in <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> artist's life have I been more completely overwhelmed". This {{was the beginning of a}} friendship which was lifelong, albeit temporarily derailed when Brahms took the side of Joachim's wife in their divorce proceedings of 1883. Brahms also admired Joachim as a composer, and in 1856 they were to embark on a mutual training exercise to improve their skills in (in Brahms's words) [...] "double counterpoint, canons, fugues, preludes or whatever". Bozarth notes that [...] "products of Brahms's study of counterpoint and early music over the next few years included [...] "dance pieces, preludes and fugues for organ, and neo-Renaissance and neo-Baroque choral works." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his speech}} Scientific and Religious Truth (1974) while {{accepting}} the Romano Guardini Prize, Heisenberg affirmed:"In {{the history of}} science, ever since the famous trial of Galileo, it has repeatedly been claimed that scientific truth cannot be reconciled with the religious interpretation of the world. Although I am now convinced that scientific truth is unassailable in its own field, I have never found it possible to dismiss the content of religious thinking as simply part of an outmoded phase in the consciousness of mankind, a part we shall {{have to give up}} from now on. Thus in <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life I have repeatedly been compelled to ponder on the relationship of these two regions of thought, for I {{have never been able to}} doubt the reality of that to which they point." [...] (Heisenberg 1974, 213)"Where no guiding ideals are left to point the way, the scale of values disappears and with it the meaning of our deeds and sufferings, and at the end can lie only negation and despair.|$|E
