40|$|Background: Increased {{staffing}} and oncology {{drug costs}} per physician, combined with decreased drug revenue, have made private hematology-oncology practices susceptible to increased financial risk. We hypothesized that practices {{with a higher}} com-bined commercial insurance (CCI) mix would experience greater inefficiencies in insurance billing (IB) processes and higher IB administrative costs. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was administered to a national pool of private hematology-oncology practices. Prac-tices were identified through the ASCO online registry. Partici-pants self-reported insurance information. T and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to compare high (50 % or more) Medicare payer mix groups and high (50 % or more) CCI payer mix groups for practice operation indicators. These tests were also used to compare denial processing cost per Medicare patient and CCI patient. Results: Among the 33 practices that responded to the sur-vey, themean <b>total</b> <b>IB</b> administrative cost for highMedicare payer mix groups was $ 191, 646. 25 (standard deviation [SD], $ 173, 031. 63), significantly lower (P. 0454) than the mean for high CCI groups at $ 476, 280. 00 (SD, $ 475, 408. 57). The mean annual cost per IB support staff member was significantly higher (P. 0453) in the high CCI group at $ 49, 778. 67 (SD $ 14, 896. 32) compared with the mean cost in the high Medicare group, which was $ 39, 413. 08 (SD, $ 12, 068. 17). Medicare pa-tient denial processing cost was significantly lower (P. 0237) than that for CCI patients. Conclusion: Practices with a high Medicare payer mix expe-rience both lower mean cost per FTE IB support staff member and <b>total</b> overall <b>IB</b> administrative cost.

" In the former, we measured the near field and far field of seismic waves from a buried explosion in an attempt to detect a microearthquake which might have been triggered by the explosion. The radiation pattern of seismic waves from the microearthquake should indicate the nature of existing tectonic stress. In the shaker experiment, a precise measurement of change of apparent seismic velocity was made before and after the explosion in the nearby granitic rocks by the use of a special hydraulic oscillator.

Moreover, a stronger reduction in EM is found when more reputable IBs are matched with more reputable VCs, which indicates that VC and IB reputation are complements rather than substitutes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to construct a model for determining the costs of administration in teacher evaluation. Five Minnesota and Iowa school organizations from the School Improvement Model (SIM) Project comprised the sample. SIM, a consortium project of those school organizations, Iowa State University, financed by the Northwest Area Foundation, provided access to administrators 2 ̆ 7 time utilization estimates, as well as to budget and personnel records;SIM involved students in fourth (elementary) and eighth (secondary) grades; therefore, no high schools were involved in the study. Time commitment estimates in three areas of administration (General Administration, Supervision, and Teacher Evaluation) were converted to percentages of contract hours, and those percentages were applied to salaries of the 21 sample administrators and two teacher advisors. Resulting data were compared to General Fund Instructional Budget (<b>IB)</b> <b>totals</b> for each building. <b>IB</b> <b>totals</b> were arrived at by subtracting categorical funding from 1982 - 83 general fund budget amounts for the buildings (<b>IB</b> = <b>Total</b> General Fund Budget - Categorical Funding). Categorical funds were removed to define budget dollars most closely associated with instruction;The model formula was tested via two data applications: a mainframe computer at Iowa State University (utilizing SPSSx), and a microcomputer (utilizing Advanced Version Visicalc). Costs of teacher evaluation were accurately determined for the SIM schools. However, these numbers were only illustrative of how the model worked, and should not be generalized to a larger target population;Findings indicated that administration cost about 4 percent of the IB for the SIM schools; teacher evaluation less than one-half (. 40 percent). SIM administrators and teacher advisors spent only 4. 5 percent of their time on teacher evaluation, while estimating 17. 5 percent!;Two general conclusions were reached: (1) the model was successful, thus providing a framework for determining the costs of administration in teacher evaluation; and (2) it was not costly nor time-consuming to evaluate teachers in the SIM Project school organizations...|$|R

A line selected for large litter size for 124 generations (H) and a control line (K) maintained without selection for the same number of generations were crossed (HK) and used as a basis for the experiment. Within the HK cross, full sib, cousin or random mating were practised for two generations in order to create new inbreeding (IB F) at a fast rate. In the first generation of systematic mating, old inbreeding was regenerated in addition to creation of new inbreeding from the mating design giving <b>total</b> inbreeding (<b>IB</b> T). The number of pups born alive (NBA) and body weights of the animals were then analysed by a model including both IB T and IB F. The IB T of the dam was in the present study found to reduce the mean NBA with - 0. 48 (± 0. 22) (p F was - 0. 42 (± 0. 27). For the trait NBA per female mated, the effect of IB T was estimated to be - 0. 45 (± 0. 29) per 10 % increase in the inbreeding coefficient and the effect of IB F was - 0. 90 (± 0. 37) (p F of the dam could be found on sex-ratio and body weights at three and six weeks of age in a population already adjusted for IB T. </p...|$|R

This study was designed to investigate the choices International Baccalaureate (IB) science teachers make in curriculum and instruction. Data was gathered via a survey completed by IB science teachers who had attended either an April, 2007 workshop in Reston, Virginia or a January, 2008 IB roundtable discussion in Kansas City, Missouri. Surveys solicited the different choices IB science teachers make for options, Internal Assessment (IA) activities, Theory of Knowledge (TOK) emphasis, and demographics. Teachers' reasons for their option choices were also analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS descriptive statistics, Pearson's product-moment correlations, and linear regression. It was found that IB science teachers' most frequent reasons for their option choices were related to ease, interest, background, and available resources. IB science teachers used a variety of IA activities, with hands-on activities and worksheets being most frequent.

The genes for all three representatives of the basic (type II) cytokeratin subfamily, i. e., keratins Ia, Ib and III, contain eight introns of variable sizes (0. 1 - 1. 8 kb) and their exon patterns are very similar. The gene coding for keratin VIb, a representative of the acidic (type I) subfamily, contains seven introns, and the size pattern of its five innermost exons closely resembles that of the genes of the type II keratins. Most of the introns are located in regions coding for the alpha-helical cores of these proteins.

40|$|Aims: We {{attempt to}} {{constrain}} progenitors {{of the different}} types of supernovae from their spatial distributions relative to star formation regions in their host galaxies, as traced by H alpha + NII line emission. Methods: We analyse 63 supernovae which have occurred within galaxies from our H alpha survey of the local Universe. Three statistical tests are used, based on pixel statistics, H alpha radial growth curves, and total galaxy emission-line fluxes. Results: Many more type II supernovae come from regions of low or zero emission line flux than would be expected if the latter accurately traces high-mass star formation. We interpret this excess as a 40 % `Runaway' fraction in the progenitor stars. Supernovae of types Ib and Ic do appear to trace star formation activity, with a much higher fraction coming from the centres of bright star formation regions than is the case for the type II supernovae. Type Ia supernovae overall show a weak correlation with locations of current star formation, but there is evidence that a significant minority, up to about 40 %, may be linked to the young stellar population. The radial distribution of all core-collapse supernovae (types Ib, Ic and II) closely follows that of the line emission and hence star formation in the their host galaxies, apart from a central deficiency which is less marked for supernovae of types Ib and Ic than for those of type II. Core-collapse supernova rates overall are consistent with being proportional to galaxy total luminosities and star formation rates; however, within this <b>total</b> the type <b>Ib</b> and Ic supernovae show a moderate bias towards more luminous host galaxies, and type II supernovae a slight bias towards lower-luminosity hosts.

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{supplement}} to our 2006 ICIP paper, “Dead-End Elimination as a Heuristic for Min-Cut Image Segmentation” [1], which we assume the reader has read. We summarize the proof of the dead-end elimination theorem (due to Desmet et al. [2] and Goldstein [3]), briefly discuss the performance of our current implementation of DEE pairs, show the input images for which timings are referenced in the main paper, and present examples of processed images to show that DEE {{does not affect the}} resulting segmentation. 1 Proof of DEE Theorem The original dead-end elimination theorem is due to Desmet et al. [2]. Goldstein’s DEE theorem [3] is closely related but more powerful: Let ia and ir be two specific assignments at a particular position i. Then, if E(ia) − E(ib) + ∑ j min[E(ia, j f) − E(ib, j f) ]> 0, f the assignment ia cannot possibly be in the global minimum configuration and can therefore be eliminated from the space. ia cannot be in the global minimum energy assignment if there exists another assignment at the same position, ib, such that the total energy with ia is higher than the <b>total</b> energy with <b>ib</b> even when we choose every other position to give ia the best pairwise energies relative to ib. We now summarize proofs due to Desmet and Goldstein. Proof. Given two possible assignments, ia and ib at position i, let us assume that E(ia) − E(ib) + ∑ j min[E(ia, j f) − E(ib, j f) ]> 0 f This is the premise of the DEE theorem.

40|$|Background: Presentation {{with acute}} chest pain is common, but the {{conventional}} 12 -lead ECG has limitations in {{the detection of}} regional myocardial ischaemia. The previously described method of the body surface mapping system (BSM) Delta map, derived from an 80 -electrode BSM, {{as well as a}} novel parameter <b>total</b> ischaemic burden (<b>IB),</b> may offer improved diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in patients with myocardial ischaemia. Methods: The feasibility of using the novel BSM Delta map technique, and IB, for transient regional myocardial ischaemia was assessed in comparison with 12 -lead ECG in 49 patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with cardiac-sounding chest pain. Results: The sensitivity and specificity of 12 -lead ECG for the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was 67 and 55 %, respectively, positive likelihood ratio (+LR) 1. 52 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 86, 2. 70] and negative likelihood ratio (?LR) 0. 58 [95 % CI 0. 30, 1. 12]. The sensitivity and specificity of the BSM Delta map for the diagnosis of ACS was 71 and 78 %, +LR 3. 19 [95 % CI 1. 31, 7. 80], ?LR 0. 37 [95 % CI 0. 20, 0. 68]. There was a significantly positive correlation between peak troponin-I concentration and IB (r= 0. 437; P< 0. 002). Conclusion: This pilot study confirms the feasibility of using the Delta map for the diagnosis of ACS in patients presenting to the ED with cardiac-sounding chest pain and suggests that it has promising diagnostic accuracy and has superior sensitivity and specificity to the 12 -lead ECG. The novel parameter of IB shows a significant correlation with troponin-I and is a promising tool for describing the extent of ischaemia. The use of the BSM Delta map in the ED setting could improve the diagnosis of clinically important ischaemic heart disease and furthermore presents the result in an intuitive manner, requiring little specialist experience.

40|$|The general {{aim of this}} Doctoral Thesis {{has been}} to study the {{influence}} of factors that influence growth performance and carcass and meat quality of Iberian (IB) pigs reared under intensive management systems. The influence of gender and castration of females, slaughter weight, feed restriction and terminal sire line were studied. To reach these goals, four trials were carried out. In the first trial a <b>total</b> of 360 <b>IB</b> dam x Spanish Duroc sire pigs was used to study the influence of gender and castration (intact females, IF vs. castrated females, CF vs. castrated males, CM) and slaughter weight (SW; 145 vs. 156 kg body weight, BW) on performance and carcass and meat quality. Pigs that were slaughtered with 145 kg BW (251 d of age) began the trial with 20 kg BW (80 d of age) and pigs that were slaughtered with 156 kg BW (268 d of age) began the trial with 30 kg BW (97 d of age). Meat samples were taken at m. Longissimus dorsi {{at the level of}} the last rib and backfat (BF) samples were taken at the tail insertion. Fatty acid profile of BF was not analysed in the pigs slaughtered at 156 kg BW and therefore only the fatty acid profile of each gender from pigs slaughtered at 145 kg BW were compared. There were six treatments with four replicates each. The experimental unit was a pen (15 pigs for productive performance and carcass quality, four pigs for meat quality and two pigs for fatty acid profile of BF). For the entire experiment, IF ate less feed (2. 72 vs. 2. 85 and 2. 92 kg/d; P 0, 10). For the entire experiment (from 20 to 145 and from 30 to 156 kg BW, respectively), pigs slaughtered at 145 kg BW ate less feed (2. 74 vs. 2. 92 kg/d; P 0. 10). It is concluded that intact females are an alternative to castrated females for intensive production of Iberian pigs. Also, the reduction in slaughter weight from 156 to 145 kg body weight is recommended for this type of production. In the second trial, IB × Duroc pigs (n= 168), with an average age of 152 d (42 ± 2 kg) were used to investigate the influence of feeding regimen (ad libitum access to feed, AL vs. 82 % of AL from 152 to 201 d of age and 72 % from 202 to 263 d of age, FR) and gender (intact females, IF vs. castrated females, CF vs. castrated males, CM) on growth performance and carcass and meat quality. For the last 54 d before slaughter at 317 d of age, all pigs had AL access to feed. Meat samples were taken at m. Longissimus dorsi {{at the level of the}} last rib. Between 152 and 263 d of age, pigs consuming AL had greater (P 0. 10) affect pork quality. Intact females tended (P 0. 10). Duroc sired pigs grew faster (689 vs. 549 g/d; P 0. 10). It is concluded that productive performance and primal cuts yield are higher for intact females than for castrated males.
