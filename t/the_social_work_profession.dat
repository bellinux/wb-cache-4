She co-founded, with Ellen Gates Starr, an early settlement house in the United States, Chicago's Hull House that would later become {{known as one of}} the most famous settlement houses in America. In an era when presidents such as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson identified themselves as reformers and social activists, Addams was one of the most prominent reformers of the Progressive Era. She helped [...] America address and focus on issues that were of concern to mothers, such as the needs of children, local public health, and world peace. In her essay “Utilization of Women in City Government,” Jane Addams noted the connection between the workings of government and the household, stating that many departments of government, such as sanitation and the schooling of children, could be traced back to traditional women’s roles in the private sphere. Thus, these were matters of which women would have more knowledge than men, so women needed the vote to best voice their opinions. She said that if women were to be responsible for cleaning up their communities and making them better places to live, they needed to be able to vote to do so effectively. Addams became a role model for middle-class women who volunteered to uplift their communities. She is increasingly being recognized as a member of the American pragmatist school of philosophy, and is known by many as the first woman [...] "public philosopher in the history of the United States. In 1889 she co-founded Hull House, and in 1920 she was a co-founder for the ACLU.

This study {{examined}} the attitudes and perceived risks {{regarding the use of}} cannabis as a medical intervention from the perspectives of emerging health service professionals, with special reference to the medical and <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>professions.</b> An exploratory, mixed methods study design was utilized, with a non-probability sample of 175 subjects from the graduate medical and <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> programs offered by two large public universities in California. The study findings indicate that pain and anxiety were the most frequently endorsed conditions for cannabis use and that both the groups of respondents rated alcohol and nicotine as having more perceived risk than cannabis. In general, both professional groups held a relatively favorable view of medical cannabis, and the difference in their mean medical cannabis acceptance scores was not statistically significant. There were statistically significant differences (p<. 001) between the two professional groups of the study sample on the mean score that assessed clients/patients having experienced problems with use of medical cannabis; and on the mean endorsement score of their respective friends using medical cannabis. There was a statistically significant difference between these groups (p=. 004), on the mean endorsement score of their family members??? use of cannabis. The majority of those who reported having family members that use medical cannabis endorsed the notion that their family members experienced some type of benefit related to cannabis use. Political affiliation and religious differences elicited differences in the Medical Cannabis Acceptance Score with liberal, non-Christian respondents having relatively more acceptance of medical cannabis use. Study recommendations include the need for newly constructed paradigms that help service providers assess how their value and belief systems affect {{the ways in which they}} view medical cannabis use in light of the increasing number of states that permit the legal use of cannabis for medical purposes.
