500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{democratic}} nature of the vaudeville performance circuit, Vaudeville's writer and executive producer said in reference to Ali that the film [...] "embraced everything from Caruso <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> threw up." [...] By contrast, in episode 30 of the Sundance Channel television program Iconoclasts, magician David Blaine speaks enthusiastically of Ali. During the episode, Blaine shows artist Chuck Close Ali's kerosene and water finale footage from Politiquerias and comments that Ali is his [...] "favorite magician... it's real but nobody's {{been able to do}} it since... his name was Hadji Ali... he's my favorite of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} season with Cleveland, in 1992, Lofton hit [...]285. His 66 stolen bases broke the all-time record for an American League rookie and was the most by a Major League rookie since Vince Coleman stole 110 in 1985. His season's stolen base count, which led the AL, also broke a {{franchise}} record (previously set by Miguel Diloné in 1980). Indians first base coach Dave Nelson helped Lofton refine his baserunning technique and helped {{learn how to be}} successful with bunting. Lofton finished second (to the Milwaukee Brewers' Pat Listach) in AL Rookie of the Year balloting. After one season with Cleveland, Lofton agreed to a four-year, $6.3 million contract. The following season, Lofton broke his own Cleveland single-season stolen bases' record, recording 70 (which led the MLB). Lofton was selected to his first career All-Star Game during the 1994 season. His development and impact in the league led Brewers manager Phil Garner to say, [...] "I remember how raw he was, and I've never seen anybody develop into that type of player that fast." [...] Garner, who saw Lofton play in the minors, added, [...] "He went from a guy who could hardly get the ball past the infield <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> could hit the ball consistently. He always had good speed, but got lousy jumps and didn't run the bases well. He has turned into a dominant player." [...] The regular season was stopped abruptly with the MLB strike, which also led to the cancellation of the World Series. For the season, Lofton again led the AL with 60 stolen bases. His 160 hits on the season were highest in the AL and his [...]349 batting average would be a career-best. He finished fourth in Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting. When the strike began in August, the Indians were in second place by one game in the AL Central to the Chicago White Sox. Indians general manager John Hart said of Lofton, [...] "What a representative for our team and our city. He has the opportunity to be a George Brett-type player here, someone who is synonymous with a franchise." [...] Lofton would join fellow Indians Carlos Baerga, Albert Belle, and Jim Thome to form [...] "the backbone of some Indians teams that were as dominant as any." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crowe {{returned}} to Australia at age 21, intending {{to apply to}} the National Institute of Dramatic Art. [...] "I was working in a theatre show, and talked <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> was then the head of technical support at NIDA", Crowe has recalled. [...] "I asked him what he thought about me spending three years at NIDA. He told me it'd be a waste of time. He said, 'You already do the things you go there to learn, and you've been doing it for most of your life, so there's nothing to teach you but bad habits.'" [...] From 1986 to 1988, he was given his first professional role by director Daniel Abineri, in a New Zealand production of The Rocky Horror Show. He played the role of Eddie/Dr Scott. He repeated this performance in a further Australian production of the show, which also toured New Zealand. In 1987, Crowe spent six months busking when he could not find other work. In the 1988 Australian production of Blood Brothers, Crowe played the role of Mickey. He was also cast again by Daniel Abineri in the role of Johnny, in the stage musical Bad Boy Johnny and the Prophets of Doom in 1989.|$|E
500|$|Stein {{says he got}} {{the role}} of Bueller's Economics teacher through six degrees of separation. [...] "Richard Nixon {{introduced}} me <b>to</b> <b>a</b> man named Bill Safire, who's a New York Times columnist. He introduced me <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who's</b> <b>an</b> executive at Warner Brothers. He introduced me <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who's</b> <b>a</b> casting director. He introduced me to John Hughes. John Hughes and I are among the only Republicans in the picture business, and John Hughes {{put me in the}} movie", Stein said. Hughes said that Stein was an easy and early choice for the role of the teacher: [...] "He wasn't a professional actor. He had a flat voice, he looked like a teacher." ...|$|R

5000|$|We were in {{the parking}} lot one day, and I said to Gene, 'Look, you're off doing all these other things while still reaping the {{benefits}} of this band---and I'm getting screwed. It's not fair for me to put in this kind of time, while somebody else who is supposed to be my partner, is not." [...] And Gene looked at me and said,'That's fair.' I could have used Gene's input. But my attitude at that point was that I certainly wasn't going <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who's</b> off managing cabaret singers and producing five bands, while I was trying <b>to</b> make <b>an</b> album.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV in 2008, Marks said: [...] "It's a very, very awesome prison. I majored in architecture in college, and design is how I actually started in. For 'Super Max,' designing that prison, {{it had to be}} the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself...We're in a world where instead of just trying <b>to</b> contain <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who's</b> really big, you're trying <b>to</b> contain <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> can — in the case of Icicle — who can freeze things. What kind of a cell would <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> like that need in order to have his powers neutralized? So to escape from Super Max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist we've ever seen, involving superpowers. Because the prison itself kind of has superpowers!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Padilla then {{entered the}} Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) World Championships in the {{lightweight}} division. He recalled, [...] "I lost <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> didn’t even shave his legs!" [...] This defeat {{was a turning}} point. After the show, the judges were “kind” enough to inform him that, in their studied opinion, {{he had a great}} physique but, at 5' 2" [...] tall, was much too short to compete.|$|E
5000|$|His curveball was {{a common}} 2-strike offering, and his changeup was {{frequently}} used in those counts to right-handed hitters. He also often used the change {{as a substitute for}} a fastball when he was behind in the count. He liked to work his fastball high in the strike zone: [...] "It's often the best pitch for me to throw <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> is sitting on a fastball. If I throw it high, a lot of times he'll swing and not catch up to it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Alexander Vershbow, {{a former}} U.S. {{ambassador}} to Moscow, first met Mamedov in the 1980s; Vershbow describes Mamedov as [...] "a real problem solver, somebody who's always defended their interests quite aggressively—and volubly—but {{has been a}} good partner.

However, when her fiance returns, she finds out that he has married Alicia, a [...] "white woman", {{and is no longer}} interested in her. The rest of the story mostly revolves around how Alicia wins over all and sundry with her agreeable character and willingness to meld and melt into Indian society. Arathi assumes a larger-than-life good samaritan character, which is presumably the very antithesis of a jilted lover.|$|E
5000|$|However, to {{the average}} Mexican, [...] "joto" [...] or [...] "puto" [...] is highly pejorative and {{has nothing to do}} with sexual roles (top or bottom). [...] "Puto" [...] can also refer <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> <b>who</b> sells himself for money. They are more {{derogatory}} and vulgar in that they underscore the sexually non-conforming nature of their passive/receptive position in the homosexual act. The invective associated with all these appellations speaks to the way effeminate homosexual men are viewed as having betrayed the Mexican man's prescribed gender and sexual role. There are also some regional variants such as leandro, lilo, mariposón, puñal, among others.|$|E

I was a runner, and they told me to go pick up this producer at San Vicente and something, and it turns out there are two San Vicentes in Los Angeles, and I had gone to the wrong one.
