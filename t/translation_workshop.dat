50|$|In 1958, at the Second Congress of Slavists in Moscow, {{the debate}} between {{linguistic}} and literary approaches to translation {{reached a point where}} it was proposed that the best thing might be to have a separate science that was able to study all forms of translation, without being wholly within Linguistics or wholly within Literary Studies. Within Comparative Literature, <b>translation</b> <b>workshops</b> were promoted in the 1960s in some American universities like the University of Iowa and Princeton.During the 1950s and 1960s, systematic linguistic-oriented studies of translation began to appear. In 1958, the French linguists Jean-Paul Vinay and Jean Darbelnet carried out a contrastive comparison of French and English. In 1964, Eugene Nida published Toward a Science of Translating, a manual for Bible translation influenced to some extent by Harris's transformational grammar. In 1965, John C. Catford theorized translation from a linguistic perspective. In the 1960s and early 1970s, the Czech scholar Jiří Levý and the Slovak scholars Anton Popovič and František Miko worked on the stylists of literary translation.|$|R

40|$|This third {{volume of}} Lage Landen Studies offers {{a glimpse of}} recent {{international}} and internationalizing trends in Dutch Studies. It presents a comparative view of the virtually synchronic dynamics of the translation, promotion and reception of contemporary Dutch author Arnon Grunberg in five Romance languages between 1996 and 2009. This interdisciplinary approach, which focuses on the crossroads of language, literature and culture, {{as well as on}} aspects of the sociologies of literature and translation, is combined with views from translation studies, comparative literature, and bibliology in order to build bridges between theory and practice. The first part is devoted to the seldom-heard perspective of the translator and dissects the circumstances in which works by Arnon Grunberg – and by his heteronym Marek van der Jagt – are translated, promoted and received in five Romance languages. The function and ‘visual translation’ of book covers are also analyzed. Notwithstanding the relative homogeneity of the languages, their cultural background and geographical location, remarkable differences come to light. The first part rounds off by looking at the promotional possibilities of writer’s tours and <b>translation</b> <b>workshops</b> in the target countries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The paper {{intends to}} {{extrapolate}} the new perspective of “science ” of translation {{as well as}} distinguish the differences and similarities in translation theories between Nida and Chomsky. However, the ultimate initiation zooms in the interpretations {{and understanding of the}} translation theories between the two. Both Chomsky and Nida made metaphysical claims about the object of investigation. Nida tends to reveals theoretical priorities, Chomsky’s theory is similarly constructed, making the “logic ” of the models similar. Nida’s and Chomsky’s theories are self-reflective, but Chomsky’s universal forms exist at a much deeper, abstract level than Nida’s kernels. Index Terms—Nida & Chomsky, translation theory, deep structure, surface structure, kernel structure I. BACKGROUND With the new perspective pracitsed in North American <b>translation</b> <b>workshops</b> characterized by a theoretical na‟ivete‟ and subjective methodologies reinforcing whatever theoretical values individual translator hold, the theoretical contributions of the workshop approach summarized by Joseph Graham (1981) much that has been written on the subject of translation yields very little when sifted for theoretical substance because it has always been written as if spoken in the workshop.
