50|$|After Pyrrhus' death, in ca. 270 BCE, the Acarnanians and Aetolians settled their differences, {{agreeing on}} the Acheloos River as their mutual border, and {{concluded}} a perpetual alliance. The treaty specified {{the obligations of}} mutual military assistance, and the two leagues assured each other the rights of epigamia, citizenship, and acquisition of property. This <b>treaty</b> <b>records</b> seven strategoi (one each from Oiniadai, Derion, Stratos, Phoitia, Thyrreion, Anaktorion and Leucas), a hipparch (from Oiniadai), a foreign secretary (from Oiniadai), and a treasurer (from Stratos). The frequent occurrence of officials indicates {{that at the time}} it was the most important city of the League. According to Polybius, however, soon after the Aetolians allied themselves with Pyrrhus' son. Alexander II of Epirus, and invaded Acarnania, dividing the country between them: the northern part with Leucas went to Epirus, and the south was incorporated into the Aetolian League.|$|E
40|$|Historical {{research}} on diplomatic negotiations between indigenous peoples and colonial States is usually based {{almost exclusively on}} a single kind of documentary source: the <b>treaty</b> <b>records,</b> written by {{only one of the}} parties in a language that the other party did not understand. As a result of this unilateral documentation, the texts often reflect a correlation of forces that is always favorable to those who have written them, while they keep silent about the indigenous points of view. Through the analysis of a number of sources from the two last decades of the 18 th century, originated in the southern frontier of Mendoza (currently argentinian territory), this paper aims at demonstrating that the written records are but just a portion of what was orally discussed and {{that it is possible to}} try a reconstitution of the indigenous version of those negotiations, putting into context the <b>treaty</b> <b>records</b> and complementing them whith other documents that provide evidences of the verbal requests of the Indians.

50|$|Of 140 <b>{{treaties}}</b> are <b>recorded</b> in the Chunqiu, {{more than}} half are bilateral. Bilateral treaties were concluded for mutual defence, trade, marriage alliance, {{and for the sake}} of traditional friendship between states. With the hegemony of Duke Huan of Qi the states came to rely more upon the meetings of the leagues to settle their problems, and the greater number of the <b>recorded</b> <b>treaties</b> became multilateral. Multilateral treaties often carried more weight with individual states because there were provisions for joint action on the part of the other signatories against any state which violated the provisions. It was only with the decline of Jin power toward the close of the 6th century BC that a system of bilateral alliances again became predominant.|$|R

[...] Because of doubts concerning the legal status of the accord, the British did not put the McMahon Line on their maps until 1937, nor did they publish the Simla Convention in the <b>treaty</b> <b>record</b> until 1938. Rejecting Tibet's 1913 declaration of independence, China argued that the Simla Convention and McMahon Line were illegal and that Tibetan government was merely a local government without treaty-making powers. In 1947, Tibet requested that India recognise Tibetan authority in the trading town of Tawang, south of the McMahon Line. Tibet did not object to any other portion of the McMahon line.

5000|$|However, Fullerton {{disagreed}} {{and felt}} that based on the earlier <b>treaties</b> and Dutch <b>records,</b> Naning was completely under British sovereignty and that the Penghulu of Naning was like {{any of the other}} Penghulus appointed within Malacca territory and held his [...] "powers of investiture from the Malacca Government". Fullerton regarded the 1801 treaty not as a treaty but rather as [...] "articles or conditions" [...] dictated by the then Governor of Malacca on Naning. He felt that Naning was [...] "evidently a place subject to Malacca". Fullerton believed this to be substantiated by the Dutch records which indicated that the first ruler of Naning was appointed by the Dutch in 1642 who awarded him a seal of office as ruler of Naning. Prior to which, there had not been any single ruler over the territory. Fullerton thus believed that Naning had been an integral part of Malacca since Dutch rule in 1641 and that the British had inherited this when they took over Malacca from the Dutch.|$|R

As in any case involving the construction of a treaty, it is necessary at the outset to determine what the parties intended. ...With respect to an Indian treaty, the Court has said that ‘the United States, as the party with the presumptively superior negotiating skills and superior knowledge of the language in which the <b>treaty</b> is <b>recorded,</b> has a responsibility to avoid taking advantage of the other side.' ...In holding today that the bed of the Bighorn River passed to the State of Montana upon its admission to the Union, the Court disregards this settled rule of statutory construction. Because I believe that the United States intended, and the Crow Nation understood, that the bed of the Big Horn was to belong to the Crow Indians, I dissent from so much of the Court's opinion as hold otherwise. As in any case involving the construction of a treaty, it is necessary at the outset to determine what the parties intended. ...the Crow were assured in 1867 that they would receive ‘a tract of your country as a home for yourselves and children forever, upon which your great Father sic will not permit the white man to trespass.'

50|$|In {{addition}} to inscriptions which {{are concerned with}} the internal affairs of various cities, there are many others <b>recording</b> <b>treaties</b> or other agreements of an international character between various cities and states. These were incised on bronze or stone, and set up in places of public resort in the cities concerned, or in common religious centres such as Olympia and Delphi. The simplest form of treaty is merely an alliance for a certain term of years, usually with some penalty for any breach of the conditions. Often an oath was prescribed, to be taken by representatives on each side; it was also not unusual to appeal to the god in whose temple the treaty was exhibited. In other cases a list of gods by whom the two parties must swear is prescribed. Commercial clauses were sometimes added to treaties of alliance, and commercial treaties are also found, agreeing as to the export and import of merchandise and other things. In later days, especially in the time of the Hellenistic kings, treaties tend to become more complicated and detailed in their provisions.|$|R

Nevertheless, unvisited areas are becoming increasingly rare as the human footprint expands in Antarctica.
