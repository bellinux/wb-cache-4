40|$|In 2005, the United States {{signed a}} treaty that, if ratified, {{would be the}} United States 2 ̆ 7 first-ever {{international}} agreement <b>on</b> judgment <b>enforcement.</b> The <b>treaty</b> provides that (a) where two commercial parties elect to resolve disputes between them in a particular forum, and (b) a judgment issues from that forum, then (c) all member states must enforce the judgment. It is a document driven by party autonomy; absent a choice of court agreement (in U. S. parlance, a choice of forum clause), the treaty has no meaning or applicability. The treaty 2 ̆ 7 s signing {{was the end of}} a rigorous journey. The United States has been a party to a <b>treaty</b> <b>on</b> arbitration <b>enforcement,</b> and other nations have been parties to regional agreements on court judgments, but until now the twain have not met: there has been no agreement involving both the United States and court judgments. The new treaty, called the Convention on Choice of Court Agreements (the 2 ̆ 2 Convention 2 ̆ 2), is a much scaled-down version of the original U. S. plan. Hoping to build a skyscraper, the United States has succeeded in constructing, at most, a low hut. The goal was to create a treaty that would, with limited exception, allow successful U. S. litigants to collect money by enforcing U. S. judgments against their opponents 2 ̆ 7 foreign assets. The new agreement fulfills this goal, allowing businesses that select a particular forum in their contract and win judgment in that forum to seek to collect on that judgment in the territory of another signatory to the new agreement. All others [...] non-commercial parties, consumers, human rights advocates, and even those businesses that obtain a court judgment from a forum other than one selected in their contract [...] remain excluded by any enforcement treaty. The Convention is, in some sense, a great leap forward for the protected few, and in another sense, an admission of failure for a larger international initiative...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on a {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} constitutional framework <b>on</b> <b>treaty</b> <b>enforcement</b> in the European Union and the United States this essay addresses two suggestions – two Letters from America – to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), as the EU institution responsible for ensuring that in the interpretation and application of the EU Treaties the law is observed. First, the essay recommends that more emphasis {{be put on the}} constitutional dimension of the analysis of whether an EU agreement or a provision thereof is directly applicable. Second, it suggests that a rebuttable presumption in favour of direct applicability be introduced in the Court’s analysis. Embracing both suggestions would render more persuasive the ECJ’s approach to the issue of treaty enforcement as it would increase the predictability of the Court’s analysis and thus legal certainty, {{while at the same time}} carving out a meaningful space for considerations based on domestic constitutional principles, including those that aim to protect the delicate balance between unity and diversity that characterises the EU compound polity. status: publishe...|$|R
