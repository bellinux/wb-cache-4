5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> played spoiler in 1987. The Mets went 13–5 against <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> in 1987 and outscored Philadelphia 94–56. However, <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> won two {{of three}} in September to hurt the Mets' chances of winning the {{division}} significantly.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> then {{returned}} home for seven {{games against the}} Pirates and Marlins. In the first Pirates game, Jimmy Rollins tripled and scored in the fourth inning before leaving {{the game with a}} hamstring injury and <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> lost 6–4. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> won the second game, 4–3 (their lone victory of the four-game series), with the help of Freddy Galvis; Galvis, batting eighth in the order, hit a home run and scored three runs. In his first start against <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> since he was traded, Pittsburgh starter Vance Worley then earned a 6–3 win for the Pirates. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> scored one run in the series' conclusion, a 4–1 loss.|$|E
5|$|After the All-Star break—during {{which the}} American League {{defeated}} the National League, 4–3—Moyer, Ryan Madson, and J. C. Romero combined for a one-hit, complete-game shutout of the Marlins {{in the first}} game back, extending the Phillies' winning streak to six games, and their record to 10–3 in the month of July. The streak was extended to eight straight games as <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> swept Florida in three games of the series (one game was postponed due to weather). Happ raised his record to 7–0 on the season with another seven-inning shutout performance. The streak continued as <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> opened a series at home against the Chicago Cubs; Chad Durbin earned his first save in 11 months by pitching three scoreless innings of relief. Werth's three-run home run in the 13th inning the next night gave <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> a walk-off win for their tenth consecutive, but Chicago ended the season-high streak with a 10–5 defeat on July 22. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> won three of their next four, and bolstered their rotation by trading for Cliff Lee. The 2008 American League Cy Young Award winner came from the Cleveland Indians along with outfielder Ben Francisco on July 29; <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> gave up four minor leaguers—catcher Lou Marson, infielders Jason Donald and pitchers Carlos Carrasco and Jason Knapp. Lee and Francisco joined <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> in San Francisco after the Phillies' series victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks, and both started the final game in July. Lee pitched a complete-game four-hitter on July 31, allowing one run over nine innings of work. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> finished July with a 20–7 record, their first 20-win month since May 2001.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2014 season, <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> signed Mayberry to a {{guaranteed}} $1.5875 million contract. Mayberry entered the season {{a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> bench who some writers thought was not worth his salary, but made the opening day roster. Mayberry was successful early in the season, particularly as a pinch hitter – as of June 13, he was 9-for-19 with three home runs and 11 RBIs. He also started several games at first base, predominantly against left-handed pitchers. This success led some to suggest the Mayberry would have value in a potential trade, as <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> were not expected to make the playoffs, and thus might prefer to get a prospect for future seasons. However, some attributed Mayberry's success {{to the fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> used him in an appropriate role, rather than trying to utilize him every day.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2010 season, <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> traded away their 2009 postseason ace pitcher Cliff Lee. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> posted the league's best record in 2010, and {{returned}} to the playoffs where they lost to the eventual champions the San Francisco Giants in the NLCS.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> {{entered a}} {{rebuilding}} phase, trading away former stars Cole Hamels and Chase Utley mid-season. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> {{would go on}} to a last place finish in the National League East, losing 99 games on the season, while the Mets would go on and win the National League East title.|$|E

5|$|On November 3, <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> named Rubén Amaro, Jr. to be {{the general}} manager after Pat Gillick retired {{at the end of}} a three-year contract. Amaro {{previously}} had a long history with <b>the</b> <b>Phillies,</b> serving as a bat boy in the 1980s, a player in the 1990s, and as assistant general manager for <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> from 1998 until his appointment as general manager. Gillick remained with <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> as an advisor. On November 13, Sam Perlozzo joined <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> as third base coach and fielding/infield coach after spending the 2008 season in the same position for the Seattle Mariners. Perlozzo previously served as the third base coach for the New York Mets, the Cincinnati Reds, and as third base coach, bench coach, and manager for the Baltimore Orioles. Another former manager, Pete Mackanin, was named the team's new bench coach on November 21; he had been interim manager for the Reds when Jerry Narron was fired in Cincinnati in 2007. On November 28, <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> signed Mike Koplove Koplove, a right-handed relief pitcher, was optioned to the AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs at the end of spring training. On December 16, Raúl Ibañez agreed to play left field for <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> in a 3-year, $31.5 million deal. South Korean pitcher Chan Ho Park officially signed a one-year contract to join <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> on January 6, after agreeing to a deal in principle in December. Park was originally signed as an insurance policy for the bullpen, as reliever J. C. Romero was assigned a fifty-game suspension after violating the Major League Baseball drug policy, but won the fifth starter's job in Spring training.|$|E
5|$|On November 4, {{following}} the World Series, <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> released third base coach Steve Smith. Smith {{had been with}} the team for two years. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> were expected to have the remaining coaches to return for the 2009 season. However, bench coach Jimy Williams opted not to return to <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> for the 2009 season, notifying the team on November 10. Charlie Manuel had expected Williams to return for the 2009 season, and was surprised that he declined. However, Williams left the team on good terms, and Manuel stated that he was welcome to come back to <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> if he changed his mind. Left fielder Pat Burrell became a free agent {{at the end of the}} 2008 season, signing with the Tampa Bay Rays, whom <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> had defeated in the World Series, on January 5. The team did not tender an offer to Burrell following eight seasons. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> also released outfielder So Taguchi on November 5. Taguchi had served as a pinch-hitter for <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> in 2008, and also replaced Burrell in left field some games. Eric Bruntlett replaced Taguchi for the latter half of the 2008 season. Relief pitcher Tom Gordon also filed for free agency, ultimately signing with the Arizona Diamondbacks.|$|E

Early in 2013, <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> promoted him to the major league club, and he made 18 starts with <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> before inflaming his rotator cuff, for which <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> precautionarily did not use him {{for the remainder of the}} season. He began the 2014 season competing for a spot in the back of <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> starting rotation, and he did make two starts, but was ineffective, and was sent back to the minor leagues, where he sustained a SLAP tear, and was placed on the disabled list.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> claimed Jerome Williams off waivers and {{designated}} O'Sullivan for assignment, Williams {{started in}} the opener of a two-game series with the Angels in Los Angeles. Williams threw five shutout innings before giving up two runs in the sixth; Bastardo then gave up five more, and the Angels won 7–2. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> also lost the second game, 4–3, as A. J. Burnett's inconsistency continued. The second (and final) series of the road trip pitted <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> against the San Francisco Giants. Hamels started game one, allowing a three-run homer in the fourth inning to give the Giants a 3–0 lead. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> rallied, with a Marlon Byrd {{home run in the}} fifth inning and a two-run homer by Cody Asche to tie the game in the eighth. In the tenth, Chase Utley was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded (scoring one run) and Howard added a sacrifice fly to give <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> a 5–3 victory and Papelbon a save. In the second game, <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> jumped to a 5–1 lead before a sixth-inning infield error fueled a Giants rally. When Sandberg came out to remove Kendrick from the game, the pitcher stormed off the field in disgust; the Giants won, 6–5. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> also lost the series' rubber match, 5–2; despite a quality start from Buchanan and Asche's three hits, the Giants had strong hitting by Michael Morse and Brandon Crawford.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> {{began their}} 2009 season {{in front of}} a sold-out crowd of 44,532 at Citizens Bank Park on April 5, playing against the Atlanta Braves. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies,</b> {{originally}} scheduled to play in the afternoon of April 6, earned the distinction of playing the opening game of the entire 2009 Major League Baseball season after winning the 2008 World Series. They lost the opener 4–1 to the division-rival Braves, whose new ace, Derek Lowe, pitched eight shutout innings. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> lost the next game, and were in danger of losing the following night and dropping to 0–3 before scoring eight runs {{in the bottom of the}} seventh inning for a 12–11 come-from-behind win. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> lost their first game in Denver, but came from behind again in their next two games to take the second series from the Colorado Rockies. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> defeated the Washington Nationals in the opener of their third series, just hours after the death of Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Kalas, but lost the third scheduled game of the series after the second was cancelled due to weather. In their series against the San Diego Padres, <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> dropped the first two games as well; during the second game, closer Brad Lidge blew his first save in a Phillies uniform, breaking his streak of 47 consecutive saves extending back to the 2007 regular season. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> won the Sunday afternoon matinee against the Padres, 5–4, on a walk-off home run by Ibáñez after trailing the entire game.|$|E

Martínez was outdueled by Javier Vázquez in the second game of the series, but <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> avoided a loss by defeating the Braves, 4–2, on September 20. A doubleheader followed against the Marlins; <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> won game one, while the Marlins won game two. In the rubber game, Lidge blew his 11th save after a rain delay to give the Marlins a series victory, keeping the team's number to clinch the division at five. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> and the Brewers split the next series at two games each, with Philadelphia winning the first and last game of the series. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> returned to Citizens Bank Park for their final homestand to close out the season, opening with a fifth consecutive loss to the Astros. However, <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> broke the streak with a 7–4 win on September 29, thanks to a Feliz grand slam. The following night, <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> clinched their third consecutive division title with a 10–3 win over Houston, guaranteeing a split in the series and a playoff berth, and tying the franchise record for consecutive division titles set by Danny Ozark's teams from 1976 to 1978. After the clinching game, <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> rested most of their regular starters, six of whom had started over 150 games during the season; they lost four straight games while the regulars regained their strength, but won the final game of the season in extra innings as Paul Hoover hit a walk-off single in the bottom of the 10th inning. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> finished with a record of 93 wins and 69 losses, one game better than their record in the previous season.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> {{ended the}} month with two four-game home series, against the Marlins and Braves. In their first {{game against the}} Marlins, a 4–0 loss, they had six hits.

In the third game, Domonic Brown failed to catch a fly ball to left field; three runs scored in a 3–2 loss. <b>The</b> <b>Phillies</b> won the series' final game, 5–3, with a 14th-inning walk-off home run by Chase Utley.

After <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> swept the Braves earlier in the month, the Braves returned the favor in the month's final series for both teams. In game one Kendrick returned to his old ways, allowing three runs in the first inning of a 4–2 loss. The next day, June 28, featured a day-night doubleheader. Hernandez started the afternoon game; two errors and six runs allowed by the bullpen led to a 10–3 loss. In the night game, <b>the</b> <b>Phillies</b> called up Sean O'Sullivan for his season debut and lost 5–1.
