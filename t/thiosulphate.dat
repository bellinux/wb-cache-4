500|$|Although the 2000 {{edition of}} the Coincraft {{catalogue}} of British coins says the wartime pause was due to a surplus of pennies, numismatist Kerry Rodgers, in his 2016 article on the currency emergency in Fiji during the Second World War, cited a colonial legislative record {{to the effect that}} it was to conserve copper for munitions. Beginning with the 1942 production of 1940-dated pennies, the composition was altered, as tin was a critical war material, rare because most of it came from Malaya, so pennies from then until later in 1945 are 97 percent copper, 0.5 percent tin, and 2.5 percent zinc. Such coins tarnish to a colour different than the prewar coins, and they were treated with sodium <b>thiosulphate</b> to give them a darker tone. That substance, dubbed [...] "hypo", had been used to darken all 1934 pennies before issue and most of the 1935 mintage, [...] "Hypo" [...] would be used again in 1946, discolouring the coins to discourage the hoarding of new pennies. Although the prewar alloy was restored in 1945, the Mint reversed itself in 1959, made pennies out of that wartime composition {{for the remainder of the}} coin's pre-decimal history without chemical treatment, and continued its use for the new decimal bronze pieces.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the process of {{bacterial}} sulphate reduction, which is used to removal of heavy metals and sulphate ions from waste waters. The life of animals and plants depends on the existence of microscopic organisms  microorganisms (MO), which {{play an important role in}} cycle changes of biogenic elements on the earth. The sulphur cycle in the nature is considered as one of the oldest and most significant biological systems (Fig. 1). The sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) miss the assimilatory part of the cycle and produce sulphides. The microbial population of this dissimilatory part is called sulfuretum. The SRB can be found in anaerobic mud and sediments of freshwater, thermal or non-thermal sulphur springs, mining waters from sulphide deposits, oil deposits, sea and ocean beds, and in the gastrointestinal tract of man and animals. The SRB represent a group of chemoorganotrophic, strictly anaerobic and gramnegative bacteria, which exhibit a great morphological and physiological diversity. Despite of their considerable morphological variety, they have one property in common, which is the ability to utilise preferentially sulphates (occasionally sulphites, <b>thiosulphates,</b> tetrathionates) as electron acceptors, which are reduced to sulphides, during anaerobic respiration. The electron donors in these processes are simple organic compounds as lactate, malate, etc.,(heterotrophically reduction) or gaseous hydrogen (autotrophically reduction). SRB can produce a considerable amount of hydrogen sulphide, which reacts easily in aqueous solution with the cations of heavy metals, forming metal sulphides that have low solubility. The bacterial sulphate reduction can be used for the treatment of acid mine drainage waters, which is considered to be the major problem associated with mining activities. In order to remove heavy metals from waste waters, e. g., from galvanizing plants, mine waters (Smolnik, obov locality) and metallurgic plants (works Krompachy) by use of the activity of SRB, mixed strains were isolated, cultivated, and their production of hydrogen sulphide was assessed. The cultures were then tested for the ability to precipitate copper and sulphates from a model solution. The bacteria were isolated from water samples from two localities: Východoslovenské eleziarne (works)  VS and spring Gajdovka  Gj. Isolation, cultivation and eliminating Cu 2 + and SO 42 - was carried out under following conditions: statically, temperature 30 oC, pH 7, 5, nutrient medium by J. Postgate (medium B, C and D) and anaerobic conditions. Residual copper in the solution was measured by atomic absorption photometry. The concentracion of sulphates in the solution was measured by the nefelometric method. Our findings from the isolation of SRB from two Slovak water samples and testing the cultures for their ability to remove copper permit the following conclusions: SRB occur in sufficient numbers in sulphur mineral water from natural sources and in industrial waste waters reservoirs, the sulphate-reducing activity can be harnessed for the purification of some industrial waste waters. The nature possesses a great biological potential that can be exploited under certain conditions in the cleanup of environmental pollution resulting from the industrial activity in the past and present...|$|R
40|$|An {{extended}} {{overview of}} the phase-mineral transformations of organic and inorganic matter that occur during biomass combustion was conducted. Some general considerations and particularly {{problems associated with the}} composition of biomass and biomass ash (BA) and behaviour of biomass during burning were discussed initially. Then, reference peer-reviewed data plus own investigations were used to organise and describe systematically the above topics. It was demonstrated that the phase composition of BA is polycomponent, heterogeneous and variable and includes: (1) mostly inorganic matter (IM) composed of non-crystalline (amorphous) and crystalline to semi-crystalline (mineral) constituents; (2) subordinately organic matter (OM) consisting of char and organic minerals; and (3) some fluid matter associated with both IM and OM. Approximately 291 phases or minerals were identified in BA. These species have primary, secondary or tertiary origin in the combustion residue and they are generated from natural authigenic and detrital) and technogenic phases or minerals originally present in biomass. Afterwards, common issues related to the composition, occurrence, transformation and origin of common constituents in biomass and BA such as: (1) OM, namely cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, char and other organic phases plus organic minerals; and (2) IM such as silicates, oxides and hydroxides, phosphates, sulphates (plus sulphides, sulphosalts, sulphites and <b>thiosulphates),</b> carbonates (plus bicarbonates), chlorides (plus chlorites and chlorates), nitrates, glass, amorphous (non-glass) material and other inorganic phases; were described and compared to coal ash. As a final point, a systematization of physico-chemical transformations during biomass combustion is given. It was found that the original OM and IM in biomass during combustion transform: (1) initially to devolatilization of OM and burning of combustible gases and char with formation of intermediate and less stable oxalates, nitrates, chlorides, hydroxides, carbonates, sulphates and inorganic amorphous (non-glass) material; (2) subsequently to more stable silicates, phosphates and oxides; (3) then to melting accompanied by dissolution of the refractory minerals; with increasing combustion temperatures in the system; and (4) followed by crystallisation of melt and formation of glass accompanied by some salt condensation and hydroxylation, hydration and carbonation of newly formed phases during cooling of BA. Finally, some post-combustion transformations of the newly formed minerals and phases to stable during weathering species among silicates, hydroxides, phosphates, sulphates, carbonates, chlorides and nitrates also occur due to their hydration, hydroxylation and carbonation by moisture and CO 2 in the air through storage of BA. Certain major associations related to the occurrence, content and origin of elements and phases were identified in the BA system and they include: (1) Si–Al–Fe–Na–Ti (mostly glass, silicates and oxyhydroxides); (2) Ca–Mg–Mn (commonly carbonates, oxyhydroxides, glass, silicates and some phosphates and sulphates); and (3) K–P–S–Cl (normally phosphates, sulphates, chlorides, glass and some silicates and carbonates). These associations were applied for classification of BAs to four types and six sub-types. It was found that such systematic relationships have a key importance in both fundamental and applied aspects related to innovative and sustainable processing of biomass and BA. The ash formation mechanisms and ash fusion behaviour, as well as some indications of potential technological problems and environmental risks during combustion of biomass types and sub-types and application of their BAs will be described in Part II of the present work.

Poly(2,6-diphenylphenylene oxide) reacts with oxidising agents such as chlorine, ozone, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides forming acetophenone, benzaldehyde and phenol.
