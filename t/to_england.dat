Winchelsey aided the barons in their prosecution of Edward II by sentencing their enemies to excommunication. He was appointed an Ordainer in 1310, and died at Otford on 11 May 1313.|$|E

The land Baltimore had seen was by no means the paradise described by some early settlers, being only marginally productive; as the summer climate was deceptively mild, his brief visit gave Baltimore no reason to alter his plans for the colony.|$|E
