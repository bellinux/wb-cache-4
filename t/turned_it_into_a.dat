McWhorter {{purchased}} Harvey's former log {{home and}} {{office and the}} amphitheater nearby, and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> restaurant serving chicken, steak, and fish. There was also a concession stand at the amphitheater that operated until 1957, selling drinks, candy, souvenirs, and pamphlets about Harvey.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Walter Fiers and {{his team}} at the University of Ghent {{were the first to}} {{determine}} the sequence of a gene: the gene for Bacteriophage MS2 coat protein. The subsequent development of chain-termination DNA sequencing in 1977 by Frederick Sanger improved the efficiency of sequencing and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> routine laboratory tool. An automated version of the Sanger method was used in early phases of the Human Genome Project.|$|E
5|$|Pepys was {{a senior}} {{official}} in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded in his diary that the eastern gale had <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the river front. The houses on London Bridge were burning.|$|E

5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she wanted it to be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} the trial, {{questions}} were raised about the fairness and legality of the court-martial proceedings. Owing to public pressure, the United States Navy reconvened the courts-martial board in 1945; the court affirmed the guilt of the convicted men. Widespread publicity surrounding the case <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> cause célèbre among certain Americans; it and other race-related Navy protests of 1944–45 led the Navy to change its practices and initiate the desegregation of its forces beginning in February 1946. In 1994, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial was dedicated to the lives lost in the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Reynier Fritz, a German-born Cape Town {{business}} man saw the castle {{and decided to}} replicate it in upon his return to Hout Bay, South Africa. He started building in 1986 and in 1998 it was completed, He eventually <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> guest house before dying there. Some time after his death, his widow, Christine, sold it to an overseas buyer. Allegedly haunted, the castle {{is one of the}} area's most popular attractions. In 2012, the castle was sold for 23 million Rand to a Russian {{business man}}.|$|E

5|$|The Black Cat {{opened in}} 1906, {{shortly after the}} 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In the early years, the bar was located in the {{basement}} of the Athens Hotel at 56 Mason Street in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood. This building still stands today and is now the Bristol Hotel. When entrepreneur Charles Ridley acquired the bar in 1911, he <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> showplace for vaudeville-style acts. Over the next several years, Ridley and the Black Cat came under increased police scrutiny as a possible center of prostitution. In 1921, the bar lost its dance permit and closed down.|$|E
5|$|An ardent {{supporter}} of the Kuomintang, Lee was involved in secret meetings with Sun Yat-Sen at the Wan Qing Yuan, a two-storey villa at Tai Gin Road. He also helped the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia raise funds to support the Kuomintang in their struggles against the Empire of Japan and Communist Party of China. In 1937, Lee and five other Chinese community leaders bought the Wan Qing Yuan to preserve it as a historical site; it was later {{handed over to the}} Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI), which renovated it and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> national monument, the Sun Yat Sen Villa (now Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall).|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} his Bond books, Fleming used events or names from his life in his writing. In the 1930s, Fleming often visited Kitzbühel in Austria to ski; he once {{deliberately}} set off down a slope that had been closed because {{of the danger of}} an avalanche. The snow cracked behind him and an avalanche came down, catching him at its end: Fleming remembered the incident and it was used for Bond's escape from Piz Gloria. Fleming would occasionally stay at the sports club of Schloss Mittersill in the Austrian Alps; in 1940 the Nazis closed down the club and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> research establishment examining the Asiatic races. It was this pseudo-scientific research centre that inspired Blofeld's own centre of Piz Gloria.|$|E

His funeral was held on 21 January 2000 in Eltham, with a secular humanist service conducted by Barbara Smoker. The Friends of Red House took over the public openings at this point. Amid ill health, Doris left Red House and moved into a care home in 2002; she died in April 2003. With the aid of an anonymous benefactor, the house was purchased and gifted to The National Trust in 2003, who <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> visitor's attraction, with tours continuing to be organised by the Friends of Red House.|$|E
5|$|The first Halo {{game was}} {{announced}} on July 21, 1999, during the Macworld Conference & Expo. It was originally {{planned to be}} a real-time strategy game for the Mac and Windows operating systems, but later changed into a third-person action game. On June 19, 2000, Microsoft acquired Bungie Studios and Halo: Combat Evolved became a launch title for the Xbox video game console. After receiving Xbox development kits, Bungie Studios rewrote the game's engine, heavily altered its presentation, and <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> first-person shooter. Though the first Halo was meant to include an online multiplayer mode, it was excluded because Xbox Live was not yet available.|$|E
5|$|Hadleigh Castle is {{a ruined}} {{fortification}} in the English county of Essex, overlooking the Thames Estuary from {{south of the}} town of Hadleigh. Built after 1215 during the reign of Henry III by Hubert de Burgh, the castle was surrounded by parkland and had an important economic and defensive role. The castle was significantly expanded and remodelled by Edward III, who <b>turned</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> grander property, designed to defend against a potential French attack, as well as to provide the King with a convenient private residence close to London. Built on a geologically unstable hill of London clay, the castle has often been subject to subsidence; this, combined with the sale of its stonework in the 16th century, has led to it now being ruined. The remains are now preserved by English Heritage and protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument.|$|E
