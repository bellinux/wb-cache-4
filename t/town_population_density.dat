40|$|ABSTRACT. This article {{presents}} the spatial and population density changes in Polish {{towns in the}} years 1960 – 2003. The assumed time frame allowed identifying area changes for {{a complete set of}} towns in different socio-economic conditions: the period of intense industrialisation, the economic crisis of the 1980 s, the period of economic transition and finally in the years of a market economy. The investigation revealed that the trend shown by changes and the size of a town as measured by the number of its population are distinctly interrelated. It also demonstrated a much stronger dynamics of changes in the first subperiod, i. e. years 1960 – 1985, followed by a phase of relative stabilization (compared with the previous period) after the year 1980 (mainly of the spatial changes). Moreover, change intensity and change trends observed for the urban areas and population densities vary considerably in terms of space.

40|$|Rural {{emergency}} departments (EDs) {{are important}} safety nets for the 20 % of Canadians who live there. A {{serious problem in}} {{access to health care}} services in these regions has emerged. However, there are considerable geographic disparities in access to trauma center in Canada. The main objective of this project was to compare access to local 24 / 7 support services in rural EDs in Quebec and Ontario as well as distances to Levels 1 and 2 trauma centers. Rural EDs were identified through the Canadian Healthcare Association's Guide to Canadian Healthcare Facilities. We selected hospitals with 24 / 7 ED physician coverage and hospitalization beds that were located in rural communities. There were 26 rural EDs in Quebec and 62 in Ontario meeting these criteria. Data were collected from ministries of health, local health authorities, and ED statistics. Fisher's exact test, the t-test or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, were performed to compare rural EDs of Quebec and Ontario. All selected EDs of Quebec and Ontario {{agreed to participate in the}} study. The number of EDs visits was higher in Quebec than in Ontario (19 322 ± 6 275 vs 13 446 ± 8 056, p = 0. 0013). There were no significant differences between Quebec and Ontario's local population and small <b>town</b> <b>population</b> <b>density.</b> Quebec's EDs have better access to advance imaging services such as CT scanner (77 % vs 15 %, p <. 0001) and most the consultant support and ICU (92 % vs 31 %, p <. 0001). Finally, more than 40 % of rural EDs in Quebec and Ontario are more than 300 km away from Levels 1 and 2 trauma centers. Considering that Canada has a Universal health care system, the discrepancies between Quebec and Ontario in access to support services are intriguing. A nationwide study is justified to address this issue...|$|E
