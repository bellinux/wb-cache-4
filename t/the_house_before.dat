5|$|Louise {{spent much}} of her time at Kent House, and she {{frequently}} visited Scotland with her husband. Financial pressures did not disappear when Lorne became Duke, and Louise avoided inviting the King to Inveraray, Argyll's ancestral home, because the couple were economising. When Queen Victoria had visited <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>before</b> Lorne became Duke of Argyll, there were seventy servants and seventy-four dogs. By the time of Edward VII's accession, there were four servants and two dogs.|$|E
5|$|Bamber's {{case was}} taken up by MPs George Galloway and Andrew Hunter and journalists Bob Woffinden and Eric Allison of The Guardian. Allison {{became one of the}} campaign's patrons. Woffinden argued between 2007 and 2011 that Sheila had shot her family, then watched as police {{gathered}} outside <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>before</b> shooting herself. He changed his mind in 2011 and said he believed Bamber was guilty. In 2015 the human-rights campaigner Peter Tatchell appealed to the Chief Constable of Essex Police to disclose all evidence related to the case, in the interests of transparency.|$|E

5|$|Ben starts {{drinking}} {{and plans to}} commit suicide, but Vivien appears to stop him. He then reconciles with Vivien and Violet's ghosts, who encourage {{him to take the}} child and start a new life away from <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>Before</b> he can leave, Hayden (Kate Mara), with the help of Dallas and Fiona, hangs him from a chandelier, killing him and making it appear like a suicide. Hayden takes the baby, but Constance reclaims the baby with Travis' (Michael Graziadei) assistance. Later, she tells the police that she found Ben after he hanged himself and that Violet must have run off with the baby.|$|E
5|$|Further major {{additions}} {{were made}} to the building by Sir John Hugh Smyth (1734–1802). He inherited the estate in 1783 and added the new library to the north west of the house. Sir John also asked the famous landscape designer Humphry Repton for advice about the east front of the house. Repton drafted a plan but Sir John's death halted any further work on the house. However Repton's landscape designs were implemented by Sir John's successor Sir Hugh Smyth. In his book Humphry Repton gave {{a detailed description of the}} old and newer parts of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>before</b> the library additions and included a drawing of the eastern front of the house as he saw it in about 1790.|$|E

In 1967, he starred as Montross in The Forsyte Saga episode Portrait of Fleur and made an appearance as a watchmaker in The Prisoner episode It's Your Funeral. In 1969, he featured in the BBC Play of the Month, playing Professeur Vivier in the episode Maigret at Bay, and also had roles in The Troubleshooters and Doctor in <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>before</b> making his final appearance as Dutrov in the series Department S.|$|E

5|$|Sir Arthur Elton (7th Bt) began {{updating}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>before</b> 1850 (and {{the lodge}} {{at the gate}} dates from 1851) {{but it was in}} 1860s that he made major changes. The west wing was extended and remodelled, this time with an Elizabethan style façade. Less obvious alterations to the east end (where the servants lived and worked) probably also date to this period. The fire of 1882 destroyed much of the western end of the house. In the rebuilding that followed, an even larger west end was constructed but Sir Arthur took pains to ensure that its Elizabethan south front was conserved and retained. Postcards of Clevedon reveal that the last change to the great hall window was made in about 1912, when it was given a square head again, in Elizabethan style.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} bought by Colonel Joseph Holden Strutt a British soldier and long-standing Member of Parliament. He renovated the house and {{neighbouring}} church. He extended <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>before</b> his death in 1845. His youngest daughter Charlotte Olivia inherited the house and lived there with her husband the Reverend Robert Drummond until her death in 1897. In 1912 it was inherited by Richard Strutt, the youngest son of the second Baron Rayleigh. Richard Strutt added an orangery and built the library to designs by Charles Bateman. In addition he joined the ruined chapel near {{the gate to the}} rest of the house. The house was then inherited by his son John Strutt.|$|E
5|$|When the rioters {{arrived at}} John Taylor's other house at Moseley, Moseley Hall, they {{carefully}} moved {{all of the}} furniture and belongings of its current occupant, the frail Dowager Lady Carhampton, a relative of George III, out of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>before</b> they burned it: they were specifically targeting those who disagreed with the king's policies and who, in not conforming to the Church of England, resisted state control. The homes of George Russell, a Justice of the Peace, Samuel Blyth, one of the ministers of New Meeting, Thomas Lee, and a Mr. Westley all came under attack on the 15th and 16th. The manufacturer, Quaker, {{and member of the}} Lunar Society Samuel Galton only saved his own home by bribing the rioters with ale and money.|$|E

5|$|Following Desai's {{resignation}} {{and the fall}} of the Janata government headed by him, Reddy appointed Charan Singh as Prime Minister. This was on the condition that he should prove his majority on the floor of <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>before</b> the end of August. Singh was sworn in on 28 July 1979 but never faced Parliament to prove his majority when Reddy convened it on 20 August. Reddy had appointed him Prime Minister since he had produced a letter claiming to have a parliamentary majority {{with the support of the}} opposition Congress Party led by his rival, the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In return for her support, Gandhi demanded that a law establishing special courts to try her and her son Sanjay Gandhi be repealed – a proposition that was unacceptable to Charan Singh. Gandhi therefore withdrew her support, forcing Singh to resign. His government lasted 24 days and he never faced Parliament. The convention of appointing a Prime Minister in a hung House but with conditions on time to prove majority was later adopted by President R Venkataraman.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with a {{scene of}} the band {{beginning}} to perform the song in a house's detached garage. When the first verse starts, Stefani's ex-lover (Terry Hall) walks by <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>before</b> sitting down on a swing. Stefani changes her shoes as the song's chorus is played; she walks away from the garage and down a street to a grocery store. At the store, she purchases four cans of tomato sauce, and quickly leaves. Meanwhile, Dumont, Kanal, and Young prepare a large dinner for the band as Stefani reenters the home. Stefani slices tomatoes, Dumont cooks some spaghetti noodles, Kanal cuts up a few onions, and Young sets the table. At the song's bridge, Stefani accidentally cuts herself with a knife and Kanal drops a pot of pasta sauce; both of them promptly clean up their messes as dinner is served. Dumont initiates a food fight, and touring members Gabrial McNair and Stephen Bradley join in. The video ends with the ex-lover sitting alone on the swing.|$|E

25|$|Sheridan's {{men began}} to burn Dayton.

Instead, Sheridan ordered that homes and barns around the area where Meigs died be burned, and all able-bodied men in the area were arrested as prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|Early on {{the morning}} of Monday 15 October four houses were searched in the Wellington region {{including}} a house used as a community centre, known as 128 Community Centre.

There, around 20 police surrounded <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>before</b> 6:00am and used sniffer dogs to search the house and nearby properties.
