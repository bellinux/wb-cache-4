5|$|Justice Simpson's {{report was}} tabled in the House of Representatives on 28 June 1951 {{by the new}} Minister for Civil Aviation, Larry Anthony. The Inquiry found that the Amana {{suffered}} total loss of engine power {{on at least one}} occasion, followed by rapid loss of height until it struck the ground. However, the evidence did not allow the court to determine <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total loss of engine power. Consequently, the court was unable to determine <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident. Simpson stated he was satisfied water had not been introduced into the Amana's fuel system in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or Perth.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 2010, {{five months}} after the Court of Inquiry was constituted, it {{submitted}} its report with input from the NTSB and Boeing, and stated that pilot error was <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident since the flight path was incorrect.|$|E

5|$|Spiroplasma is a cell wall–deficient {{bacterium}} {{related to}} Mycoplasma, which some think may be <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TSEs. The {{lack of a}} cell wall means it is not susceptible to conventional antibiotics such as penicillin, which target cell wall synthesis. Frank O. Bastian of Louisiana State University first discovered Spiroplasma-like inclusions in the brain of a CJD patient during an autopsy in 1979 and has hypothesized that this bacterium could possibly be <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TSEs.|$|E

5|$|A naval {{board of}} inquiry was {{appointed}} shortly afterwards that determined <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collision {{was of a}} lack of seamanship by the captain and watch officers of the ship. The Justice Minister, Kobie Coetsee, subsequently introduced a retrospective change in law to allow him to hold an inquest into the death of the only crewman whose body was found. The inquest lasted a year and apportioned blame on the captain and PWO.|$|E
5|$|A near-Earth {{supernova}} is {{a supernova}} {{close enough to}} the Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere. Depending upon the type and energy of the supernova, it could be as far as 3000light-years away. Gamma rays from a supernova would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the ozone layer enough to expose the surface to harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. This has been proposed as <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|According to Thompson, the Navy {{immediately}} began efforts {{to cover up}} <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosion. Rear Admiral Richard Milligan, assigned to lead the investigation, soon focused his inquiry into {{trying to prove that}} one of the deceased turret's crewmembers, Clayton Hartwig, had intentionally caused the explosion. After learning that Hartwig had named another sailor and friend, Kendall Truitt, as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy on himself, Milligan enlisted the help of the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) (the predecessor of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service or NCIS) to investigate Hartwig and Truitt.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images showed that <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{problem was that}} the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This difference was catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study by}} He et al. used a simple {{epidemic}} model, to incorporate three factors including school opening and closing, temperature changes {{over the course}} of the outbreak, and human behavioral changes in response to the outbreak to infer <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three waves of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Their modelling results showed that all three factors are important but human behavioral responses showed the largest effects.|$|E

5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by court martial aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. The court acquitted him, his officers and his men of all blame. The court found <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident to be the thick fog and the ignorance of the pilots. The court required the pilots to forfeit their pay, barred them from piloting any of His Majesty's ships, and imprisoned them for a time in the Marshalsea.|$|E
5|$|Cancer {{changes over}} time, and pain {{management}} needs to reflect this. Several {{different types of}} treatment may be required as the disease progresses. Pain managers should clearly explain to the patient <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pain and the various treatment possibilities, and should consider, as well as drug therapy, directly modifying the underlying disease, raising the pain threshold, interrupting, destroying or stimulating pain pathways, and suggesting lifestyle modification. The relief of psychological, social and spiritual distress {{is a key element}} in effective pain management.|$|E
5|$|Counsel {{assisting}} the Inquiry, Henry Winneke, advocated that <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accident was Spence's diabetes. Justice Simpson {{was critical of}} the Director-General's investigation panel for considering 25 possible causes of the accident but failing to consider that the Department's negligence in licensing a diabetic pilot {{might have been the}} root cause of the accident. After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot might have had a considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E
