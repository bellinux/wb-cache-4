5|$|With {{the aid of}} a small sum {{of money}} from his distant {{relative}} the Chief Rabbi, Adler got together the money to travel by steerage to New York, with his infant son Abrom, Alexander Oberlander and his family, Keni and Volodya Liptzin, and Herman Fiedler, among others. Adler did not doubt that the rabbi was glad to see Yiddish actors leaving London. In New York, they promptly discovered that neither Mogulesko and Finkel at the Romanian Opera House nor Maurice Heine at the Oriental Theater had any use for them. They headed on to Chicago, where, after a brief initial success, the troupe fell apart due to a combination of labor disputes and cutthroat competition. The Oberlanders managed to start a restaurant; he and Keni Liptzin headed to New York that autumn, where she managed to sign on at the Romanian Opera House; failing to find a similar situation for himself, he returned to London, drawn back to <b>the</b> <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> both Dinah and Jennya.|$|E

Tolkien's Middle-earth books, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The {{kidnapping}} {{of a child}} by crows comes from Irish folktales of the Sluagh, and from Maurice Sendak's Outside Over There where a girl rescues her brother kidnapped by goblins.

25|$|The Green Sun Princes {{are made}} with the fifty Essences of Solar Exalts which the Yozis took in payment from the Neverborn and altered to emulate {{themselves}} in exchange for teaching the Neverborn to corrupt Solar Essences to create the Abyssals. While the first edition hinted at their existence, they did not get official rules until 2nd edition's Manual of Exalted Power - The Infernals (April 2009). The Green Sun Princes were created by a cadre of five of the Yozis; Malfeas, She Who Lives In Her Name, Cecylene, Adorjan, and the Ebon Dragon. Each of these Yozis {{is responsible for the}} creation of one caste of Green Sun Princes and the charms associated with that caste, Malfeas created the Slayers, Cecylene created the Malefactors, She Who Lives in Her Name created the Defilers, Adorjan created the Scourges and the Ebon Dragon created the Fiends. Green Sun Princes of any caste can learn <b>the</b> <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> all five castes, as well as <b>the</b> <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> any other Yozis who have opened up access to their charms to the Green Sun Princes; in the default setting, Kimbery is the only other Yozi who has done so. The Yozis have tasked the Green Sun Princes with transforming Creation into a mirror of Malfeas, which they believe will break their bonds and reverse their disfiguring imprisonment. They call this effort the Reclamation.|$|E
25|$|The Carthaginians {{were warned}} {{of what was}} coming when Scipio sent his legate C. Laelius with a naval force to plunder the area of Hippo Regius on the African coast west of Carthage (205 BC). They took various {{measures}} to prevent a major Roman invasion. However, the attempt to persuade the Macedonian king Philip to invade Sicily was unsuccessful, and the reinforcements sent to their own commanders in Bruttium and Liguria were not sufficient to revive the war in Italy (see the articles about the battle of Croton and the Po valley raid). Nor was Scipio dissuaded by the defection of Syphax, who took the side of Carthage thanks to the diplomatic skills of Hasdrubal Gisgo and <b>the</b> <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> his daughter, Sophonisba.|$|E

25|$|Aurangzeb was {{appointed}} viceroy of the Deccan in 1636. After Shah Jahan's vassals had been {{devastated by the}} alarming expansion of Ahmednagar {{during the reign of}} the Nizam Shahi boy-prince Murtaza Shah III, the emperor dispatched Aurangzeb, who in 1636 brought the Nizam Shahi dynasty to an end. In 1637, Aurangzeb married the Safavid princess Dilras Banu Begum, posthumously known as Rabia-ud-Daurani. She was his first wife and chief consort as well as his favourite. He also had an infatuation with a slave girl, Hira Bai, whose death at a young age greatly affected him. In his old age, he was under <b>the</b> <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> his concubine, Udaipuri Bai. The latter had formerly been a companion to Dara Shikoh. In the same year, 1637, Aurangzeb was placed in charge of annexing the small Rajput kingdom of Baglana, which he did with ease.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, {{the film}} {{received}} generally positive reviews. Dilys Powell of The Sunday Times remarked {{after seeing the}} film that [...] "The cinema was a duller place before 007." [...] David Robinson of The Financial Times criticised the appearance of Connery and his effectiveness to play Bond in the film, remarking: [...] "It's not just that Sean Connery looks a lot more haggard and less heroic than he did {{two or three years}} ago, but there is much less effort to establish him as connoisseur playboy. Apart from the off-handed order for Beluga, there is little of that comic display of bon viveur-manship that was one of <b>the</b> <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> Connery's almost-a-gentleman 007." ...|$|E
500|$|Catherine also {{maintained}} about eighty alluring ladies-in-waiting at court, {{whom she}} allegedly used as tools to seduce courtiers for political ends. These women {{became known as}} her [...] "flying squadron". Catherine {{did not hesitate to}} use <b>the</b> <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> her ladies as an attraction of the court. In 1577, for example, she threw a banquet at which the food was served by topless women. In 1572, the Huguenot Jeanne d’Albret, Queen of Navarre, wrote from the court to warn her son Henry that Catherine presided over a [...] "vicious and corrupt" [...] atmosphere, in which the women made the sexual advances and not the men. In fact, Charlotte de Sauve, {{one of the most notorious}} members of the [...] "flying squadron", first seduced and then became a mistress of Henry of Navarre on Catherine's orders. On the other hand, Brantôme, in his Memoirs, praised Catherine’s court as [...] "a school of all honesty and virtue".|$|E
500|$|In 1950, Time {{magazine}} interviewed American swimsuit mogul Fred Cole, {{owner of}} Cole of California, {{and reported that}} he had [...] "little but scorn for France's famed Bikinis," [...] because they were designed for [...] "diminutive Gallic women". [...] "French girls have short legs," [...] he explained, [...] "Swimsuits have to be hiked up at the sides to make their legs look longer." [...] Réard himself described it as a two-piece bathing suit which [...] "reveals everything about a girl except for her mother's maiden name." [...] Even Esther Williams commented, [...] "A bikini is a thoughtless act." [...] But, popularity of <b>the</b> <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> Pin-up queen and Hollywood star Williams were to vanish along with pre-bikinis with fancy names over the next few decades. Australian designer Paula Straford introduced the bikini to Gold Coast in 1952. In 1957, Das moderne Mädchen (The Modern Girl) wrote, [...] "It is unthinkable that a decent girl with tact would ever wear such a thing." [...] Eight years later a Munich student was punished to six days cleaning work at an old home because she had strolled across the central Viktualienmarkt square, Munich in a bikini.|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Etty {{joined the}} RA, four major lectures on {{painting}} were delivered by John Opie in February and March 1807. In them, Opie said that painting [...] "brings into view the heroes, sages, and beauties {{of the earliest}} periods, {{the inhabitants of the}} most distant regions, and fixes and perpetuates the forms of the present day; it presents to us the heroic deeds, the remarkable events, and the interesting examples of piety, patriotism and humanity of all ages; and according {{to the nature of the}} action depicted, fills us with innocent pleasure, excites our abhorrence of crimes, moves us to piety, or inspires us with elevated sentiments". Opie rejected Reynolds's tradition of idealising the subjects of paintings, observing that he did not believe [...] "that the flesh of heroes is less like flesh than that of other men". Opie advised his students to pay great attention to Titian, whose use of colour he considered unsurpassed, advising students that [...] "colouring is the sunshine of the art, that clothes poverty in smiles [...] and doubles <b>the</b> <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> beauty. Opie's opinions made a deep impression on the young Etty, and he would hold these views throughout his career.|$|E
500|$|Loretta {{has been}} well {{received}} for her good looks and [...] "sexy" [...] image. According to British tabloid The Daily Star the character was extremely popular with viewers on Hollyoaks Later and [...] "went down a storm" [...] with them. They also add that she rivals other characters such as Carmel Valentine (Gemma Merna) and Mercedes Fisher (Jennifer Metcalfe) with her [...] "hot babe" [...] image. Loretta has been noted in the media because of her [...] "sexy blonde" [...] image. When she was axed from the series a magazine dedicated to [...] "sexually attractive females" [...] titled Babemag commented that the series {{would not be the}} same without her and praised Walton's portrayal, stating, [...] "Sundays may never be quite the same as news filters through that Hollyoaks star, Melissa Walton, is to get the chop from the teen soap. Horny Hollyoaks hangover TV might not be the same for us without <b>the</b> <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> Melissa Walton who plays Loretta Jones in the series." [...] She has also been dubbed a [...] "blonde bombshell" [...] by media sources such as Digital Spy and the South Wales Evening Post. Five's soap opera reporting website Holy Soap describe Loretta's finest moment as her food fight with Mercedes when they clashed over Dom. Jon Horsley writing for Yahoo! included Loretta's child killer plot in a feature about soap opera's most controversial storylines.|$|E
500|$|Weezer {{received}} generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns {{a rating}} out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73 out of 100. AllMusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave the}} album a [...] rating of {{four and a half}} stars, stated that [...] "this may seem like nothing special -- it's just punk-pop, delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks -- but nobody else does it this [...] so well, no matter how many bands try." [...] PopMatters' writer Jason Thompson also gave the album a positive review, praising the decision of the band to have Ric Ocasek produce them again: [...] "The guitar solos ring out as joyful as the words. And even the songs' lengths are nice and compact. Weezer comes in, plays the song, and exits. No overkill makes for many moments where you want to hear these songs again and again. Perhaps having producer Ric Ocasek back on board {{was one of the best}} ideas the band had, as the Green Album is certainly water tight all around." [...] Drowned in Sound gave the album a very positive review, saying [...] "After creating the two greatest pop-rock records in existence it's time to add a third. One listen to the Green Album has you eating out of Rivers Cuomo's hand just like in the past. [...] Rivers Cuomo is one of the greatest song-writers that has picked up a guitar. Anyone who can with hold <b>the</b> <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> the Geek-rock quartet are obviously made of stone and complete assholes. Sorry to be blunt but it's the way it is. God I think the sun's finally taking its toll." [...] The album would later rank at number 3 in their list of the best albums of 2001, tying with System of a Down's Toxicity and Mogwai's Rock Action. Q listed Weezer as one of the best 50 albums of 2001.|$|E

500|$|At a basic level, {{the entries}} in Harris's List detail each woman's age, her {{physical}} appearance (including {{the size of}} her breasts), her sexual specialities, and sometimes a description of her genitals. [...] Additional information such as how long she had been active as a prostitute, or if she sang, danced or conversed well, is also included. [...] Addresses and prices, which range from five shillings to five pounds, are provided. [...] The types of prostitute the lists present vary from [...] "low-born errant drabs", to prominent courtesans like Kitty Fisher and Fanny Murray; later editions contain only [...] "genteel mannered prostitutes worthy of praise". [...] <b>The</b> <b>charms</b> <b>of</b> a Mrs Dodd, who lived at number six Hind Court in Fleet Street, were listed in 1788 as [...] "reared on two pillars of monumental alabaster", continuing: [...] "the symmetry of its parts, its borders enriched with wavering tendrils, its ruby portals, and the tufted grove, that crowns the summit of the mount, all join to invite the guest to enter." [...] In the same edition, a similarly lurid description precedes the latter part of Miss Davenport's entry, which concludes: [...] "Her teeth are remarkably fine; she is tall, and so well proportioned (when you examine her whole naked figure, which she will permit you to do, if you perform the Cytherean Rites like an able priest) that she might be taken for a fourth Grace, or a breathing animated Venus de Medicis... she has a keeper (a Mr. Hannah) both kind and liberal; notwithstanding which, she has no objection to two supernumerary guineas." [...] Miss Clicamp, of number two York Street near Middlesex Hospital, is described as [...] "one of the finest, fattest figures as fully finished for fun and frolick as fertile fancy ever formed... fortunate for the true lovers of fat, should fate throw them into the possession of such full grown beauties." [...] More characteristic of Harris's List though, is the 1764 entry for Miss Wilmot, which tells of an amorous encounter with King George III's brother, the Duke of York: ...|$|E
