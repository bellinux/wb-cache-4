When using <b>these</b> <b>systems,</b> actual scoring lines are not printed, but {{the location of the}} impact hole (which can be determined acoustically) is automatically converted into corresponding scores by a computer. ISSF rules now require the use of <b>these</b> <b>systems</b> in top-level competitions. They are generally used in other international competitions as well, and in some countries they are even common in national competitions.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as {{telephone}} lines became available, it became popular to add telegraph onto telephone lines with an earth return phantom circuit. An LC filter was required to prevent telegraph clicks being heard on the telephone line. From the 1920s onwards, telephone lines, or balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM telegraph at audio frequencies. The first of <b>these</b> <b>systems</b> in the UK was a Siemens and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the send and receive signals. The Siemens and GEC systems had six channels of telegraph in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All of <b>these</b> <b>systems</b> used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each telegraph signal and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the multiplexed signal at the receiving end.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the motion}} of the {{particles}} in <b>these</b> <b>systems</b> is reversible, they are typically implemented with reversible cellular automata. In particular, both the HPP and FHP lattice gas automata can be implemented with a two-state block cellular automaton using the Margolus neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Chronic copper {{toxicity}} {{does not}} normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion. Autosomal recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable <b>these</b> <b>systems,</b> leading to Wilson's disease with copper accumulation and cirrhosis {{of the liver}} in persons who have inherited two defective genes.|$|E
5|$|Further {{progress}} in the 1970s was made {{with the arrival of}} the microchip, and the ensuing exponential increase in processing power has meant the development of fast and powerful systems. <b>These</b> <b>systems</b> involving digital beamforming and greater signal enhancement, have introduced new methods of interpreting and displaying data.|$|E

5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When <b>these</b> <b>systems</b> are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E
