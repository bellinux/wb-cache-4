25|$|Diploid organisms contain {{two copies}} of each gene. If these are {{different}} (heterozygous / heteroallelic), the two different copies of the allele may {{interact with each other}} to cause epistasis. This is sometimes called allelic complementation, or interallelic complementation. It may be caused by several mechanisms, for example <b>transvection,</b> where an enhancer from one allele acts in trans to activate transcription from the promoter of the second allele. Alternately, trans-splicing of two non-functional RNA molecules may produce a single, functional RNA. Similarly, at the protein level, proteins that function as dimers may form a heterodimer composed of one protein from each alternate gene and may display different properties to the homodimer of one or both variants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Transvection</b> {{appears to}} be {{dependent}} upon chromosome pairing. In some cases, if one allele is placed on a different chromosome by a translocation, <b>transvection</b> does not occur. <b>Transvection</b> can sometimes be restored in a translocation homozygote, where both alleles may once again be able to pair. Restoration of phenotype has been observed at bithorax, decapentaplegic, eyes absent, and vestigial, and with transgenes of white. In some cases, <b>transvection</b> between two alleles leads to intragenic complementation while disruption of <b>transvection</b> disrupts the complementation.|$|E
50|$|If working over a ring where SL is {{generated}} by <b>transvections</b> (such as a field or Euclidean domain), one can give a presentation of SL using <b>transvections</b> with some relations. <b>Transvections</b> satisfy the Steinberg relations, {{but these are not}} sufficient: the resulting group is the Steinberg group, which is not the special linear group, but rather the universal central extension of the commutator subgroup of GL.|$|R
50|$|The group {{generated}} by <b>transvections</b> is denoted E(n, A) (for elementary matrices) or TV(n, A). By the second Steinberg relation, for n ≥ 3, <b>transvections</b> are commutators, so for n ≥ 3, E(n, A) ≤ A),.|$|R

50|$|<b>Transvection</b> is an {{epigenetic}} {{phenomenon that}} results from an interaction between an allele on one chromosome and the corresponding allele on the homologous chromosome. <b>Transvection</b> can lead to either gene activation or repression.

5000|$|The first {{observation}} of mitotic (i.e. non-meiotic) chromosome pairing was discovered via microscopy in 1908 by Nettie Stevens.Edward B. Lewis at Caltech discovered <b>transvection</b> at the bithorax complex in Drosophila in the 1950s. [...] Since then, <b>transvection</b> {{has been observed}} {{at a number of}} additional loci in Drosophila, including white, decapentaplegic, eyes absent, vestigial, and yellow. As stated by Ed Lewis, [...] "Operationally, <b>transvection</b> is occurring if the phenotype of a given genotype can be altered solely by disruption of somatic (or meiotic) pairing. Such disruption can generally be accomplished by introduction of a heterozygous rearrangement that disrupts pairing in the relevant region but has no position effect of its own on the phenotype" [...] (cited by Ting Wu and Jim Morris 1999). Recently, pairing-mediated phenomena have been observed in species other than Drosophila, including mice, humans, plants, nematodes, insects, and fungi. In light of these findings, <b>transvection</b> may represent a potent and widespread form of gene regulation.|$|E
50|$|Two related subgroups, {{which in}} some cases {{coincide}} with SL, and in other cases are accidentally conflated with SL, are the commutator subgroup of GL, and the group generated by <b>transvections.</b> These are both subgroups of SL (<b>transvections</b> have determinant 1, and det is a map to an abelian group, so GL ≤ SL), but in general do not coincide with it.|$|R
