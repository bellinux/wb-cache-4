5|$|St. Laurent {{tried to}} project an {{image as a}} family man, and to that end often {{addressed}} schoolchildren. As he had in previous elections, he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian history or civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face, St. Laurent angrily told them that it was their loss {{if they did not}} pay attention, as the country would be theirs to worry about far longer <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> his.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the steering angle must be less <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|E
5|$|Proteins can {{associate}} to form protein complexes, these often contain {{a set of}} proteins with similar functions, such as enzymes that carry out several steps in the same metabolic pathway. This organization can allow substrate channeling, which is when the product of one enzyme is passed directly to the next enzyme in a pathway without being released into solution. Channeling can make a pathway more rapid and efficient <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> if the enzymes were randomly distributed in the cytosol, and can also prevent the release of unstable reaction intermediates. Although {{a wide variety of}} metabolic pathways involve enzymes that are tightly bound to each other, others may involve more loosely associated complexes that are very difficult to study outside the cell. Consequently, the importance of these complexes for metabolism in general remains unclear.|$|E

5|$|Van den Berg and {{his colleagues}} {{designed}} the EG Vapor Crystal Growth System experiment apparatus for a Space Shuttle flight. The experiment required an in-flight operator and NASA decided {{that it would be}} easier to train a crystal growth scientist to become an astronaut, <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the other way around. NASA asked EG and Van den Berg to compile a list of eight people who would qualify to perform the science experiments in space and to become a Payload Specialist. Van den Berg and his chief, Dr. Harold A. Lamonds could only come up with seven names. Lamonds subsequently proposed adding Van den Berg to the list, joking with Van den Berg that due to his age, huge glasses and little strength, he would probably be dropped during the first selection round; but at least they would have eight names. Van den Berg agreed to be added to the list, but didn't really consider himself being selected to be a realistic scenario.|$|E
5|$|When the Green Lantern Coaster was announced, {{few details}} were {{released}} about the ride's drop angle other <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the Southern Hemisphere's steepest. On 2 November, Warner Bros. Movie World announced via Facebook that the ride {{would have a}} drop angle of 120°. On 27 November, Warner Bros. Movie World released the television commercial, which promoted that the ride would have the steepest drop in the world. Later that day they confirmed the drop would be 122.4° instead of the originally announced 120°. Following the soft opening television commercials began advertising the ride. On 20 December, Warner Bros. Movie World revised the angle yet again to 120.5°; this was the final measurement given. Only Takabisha exceeded it with a drop of 121°.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{is caused}} by {{differences}} in the atmospheric pressure. When a difference in atmospheric pressure exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the Coriolis effect, except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the atmospheric circulation) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy forces) and {{the rotation of the}} planet. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance. Near the Earth's surface, friction causes the wind to be slower <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.|$|E

25|$|Growth {{overfishing}} {{occurs when}} fish are harvested {{at an average}} size that is smaller than the size that would produce the maximum yield per recruit. A recruit is an individual that makes it to maturity, or into the limits specified by a fishery, which are usually size or age. This makes the total yield less <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> if the fish were allowed to grow to an appropriate size. It can be countered by reducing fishing mortality to lower levels and increasing the average size of harvested fish to a size that will allow maximum yield per recruit.|$|E

50|$|The curved {{path of a}} {{golf ball}} known as slice or hook is due largely to the ball's {{spinning}} motion (about its vertical axis) and the Magnus effect, causing a horizontal force that moves the ball from a straight line in its trajectory. Backspin (upper surface rotating backwards {{from the direction of}} movement) on a golf ball causes a vertical force that counteracts the force of gravity slightly, and enables the ball to remain airborne a little longer <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>were</b> the ball not spinning: this allows the ball to travel farther than a non-spinning (about its horizontal axis) ball.|$|R
50|$|A {{drawback}} {{of the use}} of {{trailing edge}} flaps is that they produce significant negative pitching moment when in use. In order to balance this pitching moment the horizontal stabilizer must <b>be</b> somewhat larger <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> otherwise <b>be,</b> so that it can produce enough force to balance the negative pitching moment created by the trailing edge flaps. This, in turn, means that the main wing must <b>be</b> somewhat larger <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> otherwise have <b>be</b> to balance the larger negative lift produced by the larger horizontal stabilizer.|$|R
25|$|The {{alkaline}} {{chemical environment}} {{provided by the}} alkali reserve (KOH, NaOH) and the portlandite (calcium hydroxide) contained in the hardened cement paste causes a passivating film to form {{on the surface of}} the steel, making it much more resistant to corrosion <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in neutral or acidic conditions. When the cement paste is exposed to the air and meteoric water reacts with the atmospheric CO2, portlandite and the calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) of the hardened cement paste become progressively carbonated and the high pH gradually decreases from 13.5 – 12.5 to 8.5, the pH of water in equilibrium with calcite (calcium carbonate) and the steel is no longer passivated.|$|E
25|$|During {{postnatal}} development, KCC2 {{levels are}} strongly upregulated while NKCC1 levels are down regulated. This change in expression correlates to a developmental {{shift of the}} chloride ion concentration within neurons from high to low intracellular concentration. Effectively, as the chloride ion concentration is reduced, the chloride gradient across the cellular membrane is reversed such that GABAA receptor and glycine receptor stimulation causes chloride ion influx, making the internal neuronal environment more negative (i.e. more hyperpolarized) <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> at rest. This is the developmental shift of inhibitory synapses from the excitatory postsynaptic responses of the early neural development phase to the inhibitory postsynaptic responses observed throughout maturity.|$|E
25|$|A planet's {{movement}} {{around its}} rotational axis must also meet certain criteria if {{life is to}} have the opportunity to evolve. A first assumption is that the planet should have moderate seasons. If there is little or no axial tilt (or obliquity) relative to the perpendicular of the ecliptic, seasons will not occur and a main stimulant to biospheric dynamism will disappear. The planet would also be colder <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> with a significant tilt: when the greatest intensity of radiation is always within a few degrees of the equator, warm weather cannot move poleward and a planet's climate becomes dominated by colder polar weather systems.|$|E

25|$|KCC2 {{levels are}} low during {{mammalian}} embryonic development, when neural networks {{are still being}} established and neurons are highly plastic (changeable). During this stage, intracellular chloride ion concentrations are high due to low KCC2 expression {{and high levels of}} a transporter known as NKCC1 (Na+/K+ chloride cotransporter 1), which moves chloride ions into cells. Thus, during embryonic development, the chloride gradient is such that stimulation of GABAA receptors and glycine receptors at inhibitory synapses causes chloride ions to flow out of cells, making the internal neuronal environment less negative (i.e. more depolarized) <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> at rest. At this stage, GABAA receptors and glycine receptors act as excitatory rather than inhibitory effectors on postsynaptic neurons, resulting in depolarization and hyperexcitability of neural networks.|$|E
25|$|Word {{order in}} Old Norse was {{generally}} much freer than in Modern English because Old Norse and Old English are synthetic languages, where added prefixes and suffixes {{to the root}} word (the core noun, verb, adjective or adverb) carry grammatical meanings, whereas Middle English and Modern English use word order to carry grammatical information, so-called analytic languages. This freedom is exploited to the full in skaldic verse and taken to extremes far beyond what would be natural in prose. Other words can intervene between a base-word and its genitive determinant, and occasionally between {{the elements of a}} compound word (tmesis). Kennings, and even whole clauses, can be interwoven. Ambiguity is usually less <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> if an English text were subjected to the same contortions, thanks to the more elaborate morphology of Old Norse.|$|E
