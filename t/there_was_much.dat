5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> media {{discussion}} of the future site of the game due to Jacksonville's expiring contract to host the ACC Championship. The media also discussed whether Virginia Tech would be out for revenge against Boston College after its last-second defeat in Blacksburg on October 25. Despite its previous loss, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win the game, with most favoring the Hokies by 4.55points.|$|E
5|$|Just as the team's {{competitive}} {{season was}} nearing its end, Lance Armstrong {{announced that he}} planned to return to competitive cycling in 2009 after a four-year absence.

5|$|Prior to the {{expiration}} of the NEP in 1990, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> {{debate over whether}} the policy should be renewed, replaced, or scrapped altogether.

The NEP had been faced with a number of criticisms throughout its lifetime, most of them related to political corruption and other inefficiencies.|$|E

This follows DC Comics' recent trend of releasing durable hardcover collections initially, followed later by softcovers.|$|E
5|$|After the LCL lost {{government}} in 1970, primarily {{owing to the}} electoral reform, Hall managed to be re-elected as leader. He convinced {{a majority of the}} party's membership that reform was needed, and sought to remove the influence that the party's representatives in the Legislative Council held. When the Dunstan government again introduced a bill to introduce universal suffrage to the council, Hall gained the support of 7 out of 20 members in the Assembly, but only 2 of 16 LCL members in the Legislative Council supported the bill. Internally, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> opposition to any electoral reform when the matter was debated at party conferences.|$|E

Croatian wartime documents discovered in the Military History Institute in Belgrade after his death show that the ZNDH credited him with 44 confirmed kills. At least one other source indicates a tally of 40 confirmed kills with five unconfirmed. The ZNDH total of 44 included 18 LaGG-3s, 12 Ilyushin Il-2s, three P-39s, two DB-3s, two Yak-1s, and one each of the following aircraft; II-16, MiG-3, Spitfire, La-5, Yak-9, Pe-2, and A-20.

5|$|Four years later, Luongo was {{selected}} to Team Canada for his third straight Olympics. Heading into the Sochi Games as the incumbent starter, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> debate among the media {{as to whether he}} or Montreal Canadiens goaltender Carey Price would play most of Canada's games. With head coach Mike Babcock electing Price, Luongo received one start in the tournament, a round robin game against Austria, in which he recorded a 6-0 shutout. As a backup, earned his second Olympic gold medal, as Canada went on to defeat Sweden in the final 3-0.|$|E
5|$|In November 1945, the Minister for the Army, Frank Forde, {{informed}} Blamey {{that the}} government had decided to re-establish the Military Board and he should therefore vacate his office. Sturdee became acting Commander in Chief on 1 December 1945. On 1 March 1946, the post of Commander in Chief was abolished and Sturdee became Chief of the General Staff again. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> work to be done; the wartime Army had a strength of 383,000 in August 1945, of whom 177,000 were serving outside Australia.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{attracting}} the capital grew as people realized the commercial benefits and prestige {{that were at}} stake. New York City and Philadelphia each built houses for the president. State officials in New York offered to cede Kingston, while Maryland officials offered to cede either Annapolis or Baltimore. Also, as had {{been the case in}} earlier debates during the 1780s, regional biases, state pride and local loyalties were potent forces and figured into the contest. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> maneuvering by northern and southern factions in favor of certain sites, and by interstate coalitions that were formed and dissolved almost daily, as Congress debated the matter during the spring of 1790. More than 20 sites were proposed publicly as candidates for the capital city.|$|E

5|$|Ross disagreed, {{reasoning}} {{this would}} only damage relations between Britain and Portugal, an undesirable prospect given the countries' common membership in NATO, the European Free Trade Association and more. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> at stake; Britain enjoyed an annual £48million trade surplus with Portugal, and Portuguese Railways {{was in the}} process of buying 50 diesel locomotives from English Electric. In the Azores archipelago, Portugal provided NATO with a strategically key air base, which was unprotected by treaty; given the inclination, Lisbon might close it.|$|E
