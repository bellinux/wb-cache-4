40|$|The {{directive}} on Unfair Commercial Practices {{seeks to}} protect consumers by prohibiting, inter alia, misleading practices, which {{are defined as}} practices {{that are likely to}} mislead the average consumer and thereby likely to cause him to take a <b>transactional</b> <b>decision</b> he would not have taken otherwise (directive 2005 / 29 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council). While determinations of what constitutes average consumer behavior, what misleads consumers, or how consumers make transactional decisions all can be made as a matter of law, based on anecdotal observations, intuitions or theoretical assumptions, an empirical behavioral foundation can put consumer law on firmer ground and increase its efficacy. The Commission in its 2009 guidance explicitly noted, in fact, that the directive sought to take into account knowledge of how consumers actually make decisions in the market, including behavioral economic insights (guidance on the implementation/Application of directive 2005 / 29 /EC on Unfair Commercial Practices). Nevertheless, a closer evaluation of the behavioral literature shows that the task of incorporating behavioral findings in the application of the directive is more complex than it may initially appear. Consumer law should not ignore relevant research findings – empirical and theoretical – on consumer behavior, particularly those regarding systematic and predictable deviations from normative models of strict rationality that scholars have identified. At least at first blush, such findings suggest concerns for consumer law in some situations where the behavior of perfectly rational actors would not have been distorted, say, because relevant product information is readily available. Nonetheless, to apply these findings correctly, consumer law and policy must overcome a number of significant challenges. After offering some background on relevant behavioral findings, these remarks thus focus on two key challenges to a behaviorally-informed approach to the directive: (1) the material distortion challenge of determining which deviations from strict rationality indeed are errors that legitimately concern consumer law; and (2) the average consumer challenge of accounting for the complex effects of consumer laws on a behaviorally-heterogeneous population with a differential susceptibility to different commercial practices...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} “vertical {{architecture}} ” defines {{the scope of}} a firm {{and the extent to}} which it is open to final andintermediate markets; it describes the configurations of transactional choices along a firm’s value chain. A firm can make or buy inputs, and transfer outputs downstream or sell them. Permeable vertical architectures are partly integrated and partly open to the markets along a firm’s value chain. Increased permeability enables more effective use of resources and capacities, better matching of capabilities with market needs, and benchmarking to improve efficiency. Partial integration promotes a more dynamic, open innovation platform and enhances strategic capabilities by linking key parts of the value chain. This permeable vertical architecture, accompanied by appropriate transfer prices and incentive design, facilitates resource allocation and guides a firm’s growth process. Our longitudinal study of a major European manufacturer suggests that to understand how firm boundaries are set and what their impacts are, we need to complement the microanalytic focus on transactions with a systemic analysis at the level of the firm. It also shows how, over and above <b>transactional</b> alignment, <b>decisions</b> about boundaries and vertical architectures can transform a firm’s strategic and productive capabilities and prospects.

40|$|A data {{warehouse}} provides strong capabilities for answering complex decision support queries. In particular, {{it is often}} desirable to query relations as they existed {{at some point in}} the past. Much of the research in temporal databases, materialized views, and snapshot databases has some bearing on this concept. In particular, differential files provide a means for storing past versions of relations while conserving storage space. Queries involving these differential files can be optimized in a variety of ways. 1 Introduction Data warehouses are designed to help create and answer complex queries by organizing varied and potentially distributed data in a common environment. Most of the time, the primary source of the data is not the warehouse itself. Instead, the primary source is some sort of legacy transactional system. These legacy systems may not lend themselves well to complex queries. One of the main difficulties in using <b>transactional</b> systems for <b>decision</b> support is that the dat [...] ...|$|R

Unfortunately, concurrency issues present in general-purpose programming also apply to embedded systems, protection from which is currently only offered with performance-limiting coarse-grained locking or error-prone and difficult-to-implement fine-grained locking. Transactional memory offers relief from these mechanisms, but has primarily been investigated on general-purpose systems. In this paper, we present Embedded Software Transactional Memory (ESTM) as a novel solution to the concurrency problem in parallel embedded applications. We investigate common software <b>transactional</b> memory design <b>decisions</b> and discuss the best decisions for an embedded platform. We offer a full implementation of an embedded STM and test it against both coarse-grained and fine-grained locking mechanisms.

40|$|Application {{datasets}} {{grow faster}} than Moore’s Law [7, 8], both in personal and desktop computing, {{as well as}} in the scientific domain. For example, during March 2011, over 1. 6 PB of data were gen-erated and transferred for processing among the Tier- 1 sites of CERN’s Large Hadron Collider computing grid [3]. Processing all these data requires unprecedented amounts of computation, with commensurate energy demands. Computing’s insatiable appetite for energy has created an IT industry with approximately the same carbon footprint as the airline industry, accounting for 2 % of the global greenhouse gas emissions. Computers consumed 408 TWh globally in 2010, and with a forecasted 10 % annual growth on installed computing systems, this figure will rise, nega-tively impacting the environment and the economics of computing [1]. Unfortunately, a large frac-tion of this energy is wasted. Modern processors account for 38 % of the power consumption of a computing system [5], but the general-purpose computing substrate they provide is hugely power inefficient. For example, compared to an optimized ASIC design, conventional multicores con-sume 157 – 707 times more energy when executing various phases of an H. 264 encoder [6]. We postulate that a promising path towards energy-efficient data processing is the development of multicore processors with specialized cores. To implement these cores, we propose to utilize sili-con that would otherwise remain powered-off, or “dark”, due to the physical constraints of proces-sor chips. Specialized multicores can leverage the underutilized die area to overcome the power barrier, delivering significantly higher performance for the same power envelope, thereby signifi-cantly reducing energy consumption. In the remaining of the paper we describe these constraints and how they give rise to dark silicon, explain why utilizing dark silicon is a viable solution, esti-mate the possible energy benefits that could be achieved by specialized computing on commercial workloads (e. g., online <b>transactional</b> processing, <b>decision</b> support, and web server workloads), and conclude with a set of research directions for the software community...|$|R
40|$|Client {{assignments}} {{are among}} the most important factors that affect a student 2 ̆ 7 s experience in a live-client transactional law clinic. Student 2 ̆ 2 attorneys 2 ̆ 2 are presented with meaningful opportunities to engage with and learn from clients by applying their still-developing professional bona fides to real people with legal challenges. As a result, decisions regarding allocation and distribution of client matters {{are among the}} most important pedagogical <b>decisions</b> <b>transactional</b> clinical faculty make. By taking into account the unique and sometimes complex individual characteristics of each client and student, clinical faculty can optimize these allocations and maximize achievement of important objectives. Mind mapping can help clinical faculty untangle this complicated web of information. Mind mapping is an analytical and organizational tool characterized by interconnected branches of ideas and topics, creating a radiating network of related concepts. For generations, it has been used by creative minds to visualize and analyze complex systems of information. Recent improvements in technology have married the time-tested structure of mind mapping with the flexibility of tactile user interfaces common to modern electronic devices. Using these applications, creative instincts can be unleashed to collect, organize, and analyze complex and frequently changing information, resulting in better, more intentional matchings to optimally serve the needs of clinic students and clients. In Part II, I explore the importance of well-matched client assignments in achieving desired objectives within live-client transactional law clinics. I recount my experience designing an entrepreneurship clinic that satisfies those objectives in light of recent literature regarding common objectives in transactional clinic design. In Part III, I establish how mind mapping fosters the creative analysis of complex information. I provide a basic primer on mind mapping, describe its characteristics vis-a-vis other mapping techniques, and highlight how recent advances in technology create new opportunities for its application to clinical teaching and administration. In Part IV, I connect the topics of Parts II and III by detailing my experiences applying mind mapping to assignments in a transactional law clinic. After briefly highlighting the details of my early experiences with mind mapping software, I explore in detail how digital mind mapping simplifies the collection, organization, and analysis of information about client matters to enable better decision-making about client matter assignments. I conclude with a summary of key successes and self-critiques, avenues for future improvement, and opportunities for expansion of mind mapping into other areas of clinical teaching...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} authors have portrayed {{leadership}} {{as a vital}} factor in {{the success or failure}} of an organization. Hence Bass (1994; 1997) believes that excellent organizations begin with excellent leadership and organisations reflect their leadership (Maritz, 1995). Therefore, successful organisations reflect their leadership (Maritz, 1995). In an attempt to investigate the aim of this research, various performance and leadership concepts and theories were investigated: the trait concept, behavioural approaches and situational/contingency approaches. Every one of these theories gave a different explanation to leadership. Furthermore, transactional, and transformational leadership were also discussed. The difference between these two models according to Bass and Avolio (1994) is that the work performance of the followers of transformational leadership is usually beyond expectations, while transactional leadership, at best, leads to expected performance. In terms of performance, it is argued that employee work performance can lead to a successful organisational performance. This is because several organisations attribute their business success to the work performance of their employees. According to Collis and Montgomery (1995) employee work performance has a major positive influence on organisational performance. Nevertheless, the accomplishment of an organisation is dependent on the leader’s ability to enhance human resources; hence “effective organisations require effective leadership” (Maritz, 1995). Transformational leadership was identified as the effective leadership style that can motivate workers to improve on their performance by instilling trust and confidence in them. Transformational leadership is superior to both transactional and non-transactional leadership because it makes workers loyal to the mission and vision of their organizations. Bass (1990) states “that the leadership research over the years has proved that loyalty is more powerful than tangible inducements. ” Furthermore, non- <b>transactional</b> leaders avoid <b>decision</b> making, allowing their subordinates to take charge of the work process (Bass 1990). This research focuses on the relationship between leadership and employee work performance in a Nigerian Courier Company. In addressing this aim, a Nigerian Courier company was selected as the research context because of its success in the Nigerian turbulent business environment that is plagued by the country’s economic, social, and political troubles (McKern, Meza, Osayande and Denend, 2010). The research hypothesis of this research was generated to investigate leadership and employee performance. Leadership and performance were also identified as the research independent and dependent variables. Thus the research hypotheses were as follows: Hypothesis 1. Null Hypothesis: There is no significant positive linear relationship between employee performance and transformational leadership Alternative Hypothesis: There is significant positive linear relationship between employee performance and transformational leadership Hypothesis 2. Null Hypothesis: There is no significant positive linear relationship between employee performance and transactional leadership Alternative Hypothesis: There is significant positive linear relationship between employee performance and transactional leadership Hypothesis 3. Null Hypothesis: There is no significant positive linear relationship between employee performance and non-transactional leadership. Alternative Hypothesis: There is significant positive linear relationship between employee performance and non-transactional leadership. The general methodology included the use of a valid and reliable instrument known as the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) and the company’s performance appraisal process. These instruments were used to collect information about employee work performance. The validity and reliability of the MLQ is not in doubt because it was formulated from the full range leadership development theory of Bass and Avolio (1997) and has been used extensively worldwide (Bass and Avolio, 1997). The research data was analysed using Statistica (StatSoft, 2011). Once the data was imported the necessary leadership factors were calculated as per the MLQ scoring key. From the eight factors a further three factors were generated namely transformational, transactional and nontransactional leadership. The data was checked and described using frequency tables and descriptive statistics, followed by correlation matrices coupled with their corresponding scatter plots. The research data was tested for consistency and reliability. Sekaran (2000) states that in order to determine the reliability of a measure one needs to test for both consistency and stability. For this research, linear correlation and regression analysis was used. The outcome of the first investigated hypothesis confirmed that there is a strong significant, positive linear relationship between employee performance and transformational leadership (ρ< 0. 0001). However, the findings on the null hypothesis, states that transformational leadership has no significant positive linear relationship with employee performance. The null hypothesis is REJECTED, because the model is significant at ρ<. 0001. Thus, the alternative hypothesis is ACCEPTED because it concludes that there is sufficient evidence, at the 5 % level of significance, that there is significant positive linear relationship between employee performance and transformational leadership. The second hypotheses found that with 5 % level of significance there is no significant positive linear relationship between transactional leadership and employee performance (ρ = 0. 317). It must be noted that since the correlation is not significant the null hypothesis which states that there is no significant positive linear relationship between employee performance and transactional leadership was NOT REJECTED. The outcome of the third hypotheses support the null hypothesis, because the negative linear relationship between employee performance and non-transactional leadership is not significant (ρ = 0. 6718). This informed the conclusion that at the 5 % level of significance, there is no positive linear relationship between non-transactional leadership and employee performance. The findings of this research favour the conclusion drawn by Brand, Heyl and Maritz (2000) that suggested a more significant relationship between transformational leadership and employee performance, than any other leadership style. Evidence put together in the retail and manufacturing sector of South Africa, and the armed forces of the United States of America, Germany and Canada, point in the direction of the strong, positive effects of transformational leaders (Brand, et al., 2000). Again the effectiveness of transformational leadership can be reinforced by the research directed by Ristow, Amos and Staude (1999), which resolved that the effectiveness of transformational leadership was greater in a South African cricketing environment. Hayward, Davidson, Pascoe, Tasker, Amos and Pearse (2003) conducted research in a pharmaceutical organisation and found a positive linear relationship between transformational leadership and employee work performance. These research outcomes clarify the investigation by Pruijn and Boucher (1994) which established “that transformational leadership is an extension of transactional leadership” (Bass, 1997). The difference between these two models according to Bass and Avolio (1994) is that the work performance of supporters of transformational leadership is usually beyond expectation, while the behaviour of the supporters of transactional leadership, at best, leads to anticipated work performance. This research will be used to improve the relationship between the leaders and employees of the courier company under investigation. It will be useful for the placement of individuals to leadership positions in the company. It will also impact on how future leadership training will be conducted by the company, and of course add to the body of knowledge. This is supported by research conducted in the service sector which states that “transformational leadership affects performance over and above transactional leadership” (Geyery and Steyrer, 1998) ...|$|R
