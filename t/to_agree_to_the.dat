5|$|Beauchamp and the Bishop of Worcester had {{a dispute}} over the lands that Beauchamp {{inherited}} from d'Abetot. The dispute caused the two sides <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> creation of the Worcester Survey, a land survey undertaken in Worcestershire sometime between 1108 and 1118 that shows changes in land ownership after the Domesday Book.|$|E

5|$|Arundel {{joined the}} {{opposition}} {{at an early}} point, and {{did not attend the}} Stamford parliament in July 1309, where Gaveston's return was negotiated. After Gaveston returned, his behaviour became even more offensive, and opposition towards him grew. In addition to this, there was great discontent with Edward II's failure to follow up his father's Scottish campaigns. On 16 March 1310, the king had <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> appointment of a committee known as the Lords Ordainers, who were {{to be in charge of}} the reform of the royal government. Arundel was one of eight earls among the twenty-one Ordainers.|$|E

In that year, the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, {{demanding}} a separate nation. During the Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula for the subcontinent to be united as a single state, leading all parties <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.|$|E

Arhys is forced <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deal, remembering a promise he made to Evangeline to protect their son ("The X Aspect"). Faythe travels back to her father's palace and learns that her music player once belonged to her father.

5|$|Prompted by the Russian invasion, Livonia first unsuccessfully {{sought help}} from Emperor Ferdinand I, {{then turned to}} Poland–Lithuania. Landmeister von Fürstenburg fled to Poland–Lithuania to be {{replaced}} by Gotthard Kettler. In June 1559, the estates of Livonia came under Polish–Lithuanian protection through the first Treaty of Vilnius (Vilna). The Polish sejm refused <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> treaty, believing it to be a matter affecting only the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In January 1560, Sigismund sent ambassador Martin Volodkov to the court of Ivan in Moscow in an attempt to stop the Russian cavalry rampaging through rural Livonia.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund III's {{crowning}} in Sweden {{took place}} in 1594 amid tensions and instability caused by religious controversies. As Sigismund returned to Poland, his uncle Charles, the regent, took {{the lead of the}} anti-Sigismund Swedish opposition. In 1598 Sigismund attempted to resolve the matter militarily, but the expedition to the country of his origin was defeated at the Battle of Linköping; Sigismund was taken prisoner and had <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> harsh conditions imposed. After his return to Poland, in 1599 the Riksdag of the Estates deposed him in Sweden, and Charles led the Swedish forces into Estonia. Sigismund in 1600 proclaimed the incorporation of Estonia into the Commonwealth, which was tantamount to a declaration of war on Sweden, at the height of Rzeczpospolita's involvement in Moldavia region.|$|E

This ended the first stage of the Mexican Revolution, and at the same time made it clear that even well-garrisoned troops were not invulnerable to guerrilla armies.|$|E

5|$|While {{the royal}} army {{was in the}} north, Edward {{received}} news from London that the Earl of Lincoln had died on 6 February 1311. This meant that a moderating influence on the baronial party had been lost, {{at the same time}} as the antagonistic Earl of Lancaster – who was Lincoln's son-in-law and heir – emerged as the leader of the Ordainers. With the Ordainers ready to present their programme of reform, Edward had to summon a parliament. In late July he appointed Gaveston Lieutenant of Scotland, and departed for London. Bruce still evaded the English successfully, in early August even staging a raid into northern England, and shortly after this Gaveston withdrew to Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland. When parliament met on 16 August, the King was presented with a set of proposed reforms of the royal household, as well as specific attacks on individuals, including a demand for the renewed exile of Piers Gaveston. Edward initially offered <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reforms as long as Gaveston was allowed to stay, but the Ordainers refused. The King held out for as long as he could, but eventually had <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ordinances, which were published on 27 September. On 3 November, two days after the allotted deadline, Gaveston left England for the last time.|$|E
5|$|With the Magyar threat eliminated, Simeon led his hosts {{south and}} routed the Byzantine {{army in the}} battle of Boulgarophygon in the summer of 896, which forced Byzantium <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bulgarian terms. The war ended with a peace treaty which {{restored}} the Bulgarian market in Constantinople and confirmed Bulgarian domination in the Balkans. The Byzantine Empire was obliged to pay Bulgaria an annual tribute in exchange for the return of captured Byzantine soldiers and civilians. Under the treaty, the Byzantines also ceded an area between the Black Sea and the Strandzha mountains to Bulgaria. Despite several violations, the treaty formally lasted until Leo VI's death in 912.|$|E
5|$|After Resaca de la Palma, Mexican {{forces were}} cleared from the Texan {{side of the}} Rio Grande, but {{additional}} operations were required to force Mexico <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> border. The Mexican commander, General Mariano Arista, withdrew his forces to Linares, with Taylor in pursuit for sixty miles before returning to Fort Brown for reinforcements. He then marched against Monterrey. The heavily fortified city had a 10,000-man garrison under Arista's replacement, General Pedro de Ampudia, but its supply line running south to Saltillo was vulnerable. Lacking the heavy artillery needed for a siege, Taylor planned a double envelopment, with one division executing a turning movement to cut the supply line and attack from the west and south, and his other two divisions assaulting {{the north side of}} the city.|$|E

5|$|As Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) {{attempts}} {{to negotiate with}} the Aldeans, they briefly allow Dr. Crusher to reunite with her son on the planet. Wesley hints about the Custodian to her, while she secretly passes him a tricorder to scan the Aldeans. After Picard fails to get the Aldeans <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> children's return, they fire an energy weapon that sends the Enterprise three days away from Aldea at maximum warp. The Aldeans warn that they can send the Enterprise an impossibly far distance if they refuse to cooperate. During the return trip, Dr. Crusher reviews the scanner results and finds the Aldeans are suffering from radiation poisoning, which has harmed their reproductive capabilities but can be reversed if the source is discovered. On arrival back at the planet, Picard orders the crew {{to try to find a}} way through the planet's shield while he restarts negotiations.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his tenure, he sought to distance himself from previous Directors-General and their administrations by criticising them in print and attempting to introduce new staff who had no loyalty to his predecessors. Assigned with a four-year contract, Wheeler attempted to recruit two archaeologists from Britain, Glyn Daniel and Stuart Piggott, to aid him in reforming the Archaeological Survey, although they declined the offer. He then toured the subcontinent, seeking to meet all of the Survey's staff members. He had drawn up a prospectus containing research questions that he wanted the Survey to focus on; these included understanding the period between the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization and the Achaemenid Empire, discerning the socio-cultural background to the Vedas, dating the Aryan invasion, and establishing a dating system for southern India prior to the sixth century CE. During his time in office he also achieved a 25 per cent budget increase for the Archaeological Survey, and convinced the government <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> construction of a National Museum of Archaeology, to be built in New Delhi.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{government}} relied {{primarily on}} Eleanor and her Savoyard supporters, and it proved short-lived. He attempted {{to settle the}} crisis permanently by forcing the barons <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Treaty of Kingston. This treaty introduced a system of arbitration to settle outstanding disputes between the King and the barons, using Richard as an initial adjudicator, backed up by Louis of France should Richard fail to generate a compromise. Henry softened some of his policies {{in response to the}} concerns of the barons, but he soon began to target his political enemies and recommence his unpopular Sicilian policy. Henry's government was weakened by the death of de Clare, as his heir, Gilbert, sided with the radicals; the King's position was further undermined by major Welsh incursions along the Marches and the Pope's decision to reverse his judgement on the Provisions, this time confirming them as legitimate. By early 1263, Henry's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war.|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} career, McMahon faced such wrestlers as Sorakichi Matsuda, Captain James C. Daly and Gus Lambert. He also faced William Muldoon, now {{a member of}} the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. One match between the two, which took place on March 22, 1881, {{featured}} a best-of-three-falls rule, in which the wrestlers competed in Muldoon's favored Greco-Roman style, followed by the collar-and-elbow style preferred by McMahon. Each competitor won the fall in his preferred style, which led to a catch-as-catch-can match to determine the winner. The match did not take place, however, as the men were unable <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> outfits that would be worn during the match; as a result, the contest was declared a draw. One of McMahon's final series of matches was against Henry Moses Dufur. Their first match was declared a draw after neither competitor was able to throw the other within six hours. Although the wrestlers were willing to continue, the lease on the hall had expired and the match was ended at 2:45 in the morning. McMahon lost the second contest, but he defeated Dufur for the world collar-and-elbow championship in their final encounter.|$|E
5|$|On May 30, 1653, {{following}} an earlier {{resolution of the}} Tagsatzung and earlier Bernese demands, Zürich assembled an army with recruits from its own territories, from the Thurgau, and from Schaffhausen {{under the command of}} Conrad Werdmüller with the task to break any armed resistance once and for all times. Some 8,000 men with 800 horses and 18 cannons marched towards the Aargau. Already three days later, Werdmüller's army controlled the important crossing of the river Reuss at Mellingen. In the hills around the nearby villages Wohlenschwil and Othmarsingen a peasant army of some 24,000 men assembled, led by Leuenberger and Schybi. A peasant delegation tried to negotiate with Werdmüller, showing him the peace treaty concluded on the Murifeld. Werdmüller, who had been until then unaware of this treaty that had been signed only days before, refused to acknowledge the validity of the contract and demanded the unconditional surrender of the peasants. Thus rebutted, the peasants attacked Werdmüller's troops on June 3, 1653, but being poorly equipped and lacking any artillery, they were defeated decisively in the Battle of Wohlenschwil. The peasants were forced <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> peace of Mellingen, which annulled the Huttwil League. The peasant troops returned home and an amnesty was declared, except for the leaders of the movement.|$|E
