5|$|The World Cruise of 1907–1909 {{tested the}} {{seakeeping}} of the U.S. designs. Even the earlier designs, including the Connecticut class with their higher freeboard, carried their secondary armament <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the waterline.|$|E
5|$|Unaware that Novara {{had been}} disabled, and fearing that his ships would be drawn <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the Austrian naval base at Cattaro, Acton broke off the pursuit. The {{destroyer}} Acerbi misread the signal, {{and attempted to}} launch a torpedo attack, but was driven off by the combined fire of Novara, Saida, and Helgoland. At 12:05, Acton realized the dire situation Novara was in, but by this time, the Sankt Georg group was <b>too</b> <b>close.</b> The Sankt Georg group rendezvoused with Novara, Saida, and Helgoland, and Csepel and Balaton reached the scene as well. The entire group returned to Cattaro together.|$|E

5|$|Isa was demoted in 1987, because Abu Nidal {{believed}} he had become <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to other figures within the ANO.

5|$|Momoko is a {{childhood}} friend and classmate {{in junior high school}} of Chizuru; she is nicknamed Momo.

5|$|The {{election}} was <b>too</b> <b>close</b> {{to call on}} election night.

It often feeds near other species of honeyeater and no inter-species aggression has been noted.|$|E
5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the stage, but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured.

5|$|However, Lauderdale was disliked for his {{opposition}} to the popular Queen Caroline, which became a significant issue in the campaign. His agents claimed that Balfour would have opposed her trial for alleged adultery, but he was portrayed as <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to Liverpool's Tory ministry to properly represent interests of the borough. After four days of polling, Balfour lost by 9 votes (374—363) to the Whig baronet Sir Francis Blake.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals can}} learn {{behaviours}} by imitation, but ants {{may be the}} only group apart from mammals where interactive teaching has been observed. A knowledgeable forager of Temnothorax albipennis will lead a naive nest-mate to newly discovered food by the process of tandem running. The follower obtains knowledge through its leading tutor. The leader is acutely sensitive to the progress of the follower and slows down when the follower lags and speeds up when the follower gets <b>too</b> <b>close.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Joey is in a {{hospital}} room of his own, where a doctor informs him that he's suffering from kidney stones. As they're <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to his bladder, Joey is given two options: wait until he passes them naturally, or have a procedure, which he finds too invasive. Opting for the former, he gives 'birth' to the kidney stones, concurrent with Phoebe’s birth.|$|E

When the locals find them stranded or nearly stranded on the beach, they kill them and share the meat to all the villagers.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{conflict}} on {{the number}} of torpedo tubes originally included in the ships, but it is clear they were located on the berth deck and had above-water ports located on the extreme front and aft and midships.

Sheldon {{is seen in the}} cafeteria at Caltech with everyone staring at him.|$|E
