Therefore, it becomes one of the hot topics in distributed artificial intelligence research field for several years.

Secondly, we point out that task allocation process in multiple agent systems can be implement by creating the space to the mapping of the multi-agent organization. Thirdly, a modified multiple agent system oriented ant colony optimization algorithm is given, which contain pre-processing steps and the task allocation results are obtained by executing the trust region sqp algorithm in local solver. Finally, performance evaluation is conducted by experiments comparing with Random strategy and Instant optimal strategy, and very positive results are obtaine...|$|E

In two experiments 5 - and 6 -yr. old children were given a 2 -category classification learning task and then assessed the categorization modes (analytic vs. holistic) after reaching each of three criteria of learning. The exemplars were schematic faces (Fig. 1) and schematic figures of girls (Fig. 2), both of which had five dimensions varying with two values. In Experiment I the tasks with strong and weak family-resemblance structure were provided (Fig. 3) and in Experiment II the tasks with three and six learning exemplars were provided (Fig. 4). In the two experiments the analytic mode was used for the schematic faces more frequently than for the schematic girls, and with increasing criteria of learning, the percentages of the subjects who used the analytic mode increased while those who used the holistic mode decreased. (Table 1 and 2). In Experiment I the analytic mode was used for the weak family-resemblance task more frequently than for the strong family-resemblance <b>task</b> (<b>Table</b> 1).

In the interviews, many students expressed a preference for engaging with learning that reflected their vocational interests (Schmitt et al.

As such, the interview data and the attitudinal findings from the profiles evidence commonality. Consequently, some students will engage further if a learning connection is made.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the optimum decision rule for an m-interval oddity task in which m- 1 intervals contain the same signal {{and one is}} different or odd. The optimum decision rule depends {{on the degree of}} correlation among observations. The present approach unifies the different strategies that occur with "roved" or "fixed" experiments (Macmillan & Creelman, 1991, p. 147). It is shown that the commonly used decision rule for an m-interval oddity task corresponds to the special case of highly correlated observations. However, as is also true for the same-different paradigm, there exists a different optimum decision rule when the observations are independent. The relation between the probability of a correct response and d′ is derived for the three-interval oddity <b>task.</b> <b>Tables</b> are presented of this relation for the three-, four-, and five-interval oddity task. Finally, an experimental method is proposed that allows one to determine the decision rule used by the observer in an oddity experiment...|$|R
