25|$|In Eastern Orthodox Christianity {{theology}} {{starts with}} the Father hypostasis, not the essence of God, since <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>is</b> the God of the Old Testament. <b>The</b> <b>Father</b> <b>is</b> the origin of all things {{and this is the}} basis and starting point of the Orthodox trinitarian teaching of one God in Father, one God, of the essence of the Father (as the uncreated comes from the Father as this is what <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>is).</b> In Eastern Orthodox theology, God's uncreatedness or being or essence in Greek is called ousia. Jesus Christ is the Son (God Man) of the uncreated Father (God). The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the uncreated Father (God).|$|E

25|$|Trinitarians {{believe that}} God <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>is</b> not pantheistic, {{in that he}} is not viewed as {{identical}} to the universe, but exists outside of creation, as its Creator.

25|$|The Trinitarian {{doctrine}} {{is considered by}} most Christians to be a core tenet of their faith.

The holy three are separate, yet the Son and the Holy Spirit are still seen as originating from God the Father.|$|E
25|$|In {{religious}} policy, the Vandals {{tried to}} convert the urban Catholic Christians of Africa to their Arian heresy (named after the Egyptian Christian priest Arius, who taught that <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>is</b> greater than the Son and the Spirit), e.g., by sending the clergy into exile and by expropriating churches; in the 520s their efforts turned to persecution, including martyrdom, all without success.
