5|$|Another short {{stint in}} Southeastern Championship Wrestling followed, with LeDuc being given two more reigns with the Southeastern Heavyweight title. He was put over his former partner Bob Armstrong for <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> in August 1983 {{and began a}} feud with Robert Fuller, another former partner. During {{the course of this}} feud, <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> changed hands twice. Fuller was booked to win <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> from LeDuc, but LeDuc won a {{subsequent}} match to win the title for his sixth and final reign. LeDuc held <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> until vacating the title when he left the promotion.|$|E
5|$|Kai traded the NWA Mid-Atlantic Women's Championship with Strawberry Fields in 2000, holding <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> a {{total of}} three times. In the summer of 2002, Kai {{challenged}} Lexie Fyfe for the Professional Girl Wrestling Association's (PGWA) championship in Branson, Missouri and won <b>the</b> <b>belt.</b> In 2002, however, Pippa L'Vinn defeated her for the title.|$|E
5|$|LeDuc then {{returned}} to Florida, where he was kept mainly in the singles division. In October 1983, he was put over Scott McGhee to win the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship for a second time. He dropped <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> to Barry Windham the following month. In a rematch with Windham the following night, LeDuc won <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> once again. His final reign as Florida Heavyweight Champion was short-lived, however, as the bookers had him drop <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> in a rematch with Windham the next night.|$|E
5000|$|The cost of <b>the</b> Steel <b>belt</b> is high. Compare {{with other}} {{materials}} ( [...] plastic <b>belt),</b> <b>the</b> steel <b>belt</b> is more expensive. However, <b>the</b> steel <b>belt</b> {{have an advantage}} overall because <b>the</b> Steel <b>Belt</b> are not petroleum based material. <b>The</b> Steel <b>Belt</b> making prices per linear foot is less expensive compared to plastic <b>belt.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> Steel <b>Belt</b> lead by low cost of process compared to <b>the</b> plastic <b>belt.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{losing the}} title, Cash formed a tag team with Manny Soto. Together, they {{defeated}} Black Gordman and Goliath {{to win the}} NWA Americas Tag Team Championship on July 24. The following month, Cash and Soto dropped <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> to <b>the</b> team of Angel Blanco and Dr. Wagner. Cash {{was involved in a}} feud with Butcher Brannigan, and he teamed with Victor Rivera to regain the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship on September 14 by defeating Brannigan and Man Mountain Mike. They held <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> until a loss to Otto Von Heller and Kurt Von Hess October 12. The following year, Cash teamed with S.D. Jones to win <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> for a third time. They won <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> from Jerry Brown and Buddy Roberts, collectively known as the Hollywood Blonds, but dropped <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> back to <b>the</b> Blonds the following month. Cash's final reign came in 1976, when he and Frank Monte defeated the team of Roddy Piper and Crusher Verdu for <b>the</b> <b>belts.</b> <b>The</b> reign was brief, however, as Cash and Monte soon dropped <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> to <b>The</b> Scorpions.|$|R
50|$|Unlike <b>the</b> other <b>belts,</b> <b>the</b> Purple <b>Belt's</b> primary {{intent is}} not for {{navigation}} around the circumference of the city, but rather to assist in navigation downtown. It is also {{the only one of}} <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> to not leave the city at any point. (<b>The</b> Blue <b>Belt</b> is <b>the</b> only other <b>belt</b> to enter <b>the</b> city at all.) Also, while signage for all of <b>the</b> other <b>belts</b> is maintained by the Allegheny County Department of Public Works, <b>the</b> Purple <b>Belt</b> is maintained by the City of Pittsburgh Department of Engineering and Construction.|$|R
5|$|Belt hook: <b>The</b> <b>belt</b> hook was a {{fastener}} used in China. Belt hooks {{date to the}} 7th century BC in China, and were made with bronze, iron, gold, and jade. Texts claim that <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> hook arrived in China from Central Asia during the Warring States period, but archaeological evidence of belt hooks in China predate the Warring States Period.|$|E
5|$|Bret Hart later {{claimed that}} during a {{conversation}} with Vince McMahon, {{he was told that}} Hulk Hogan refused to drop the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to him. However, Hulk Hogan stated that, during {{a conversation with}} Vince McMahon, a deal was made for Hogan to drop <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> to the top heel at the time, Yokozuna, at the following King of The Ring. All three men eventually wound up in a meeting, where McMahon outlined the plan to have Hogan drop <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> to Yokozuna and denied telling Bret that Hogan refused to drop the championship to him.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Juggernaut also competed as a singles wrestler. On September 12, 1999, he {{defeated}} Michelle Starr {{to win the}} NWA/ECCW Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship. The following month, {{he dropped}} <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> to Johnny Canuck in a three way match. He regained <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> in a rematch but was stripped of the title in December. A tournament was held for the vacant championship, which Juggernaut won to regain the title. He then became involved in a feud with Kurrgan, and the two traded <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> back and forth. Kurrgan beat Juggernaut for the title on February 25, 2000, but Juggernaut won it back two months later. He held <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> for a day before dropping it back to Kurrgan. When Kurrgan was stripped of the title for being unable to compete at a show in July, Juggernaut won the vacant championship by defeating Leatherface (Rick Patterson). At Juggernaut's request, the match was a {{two out of three}} falls tables match. During the match, he was legitimately unable to move for several minutes and suffered memory loss after Leatherface hit him with a chair.|$|E
25|$|Brisco {{teamed with}} his brother to win the Mid-Atlantic version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship three times. As heels, they beat Ricky Steamboat and Jay Youngblood for <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> on June 18, 1983. This set up a rivalry in which <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> {{switched}} hands several times. Steamboat and Youngblood regained <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> on October 3, but the Briscos won them back on October 21. They held the title for {{a little over a}} month before dropping it back to Steamboat and Youngblood. The Briscos again won <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> <b>the</b> following year, from Wahoo McDaniel and Mark Youngblood. In 1985 he fought Ric Flair for the NWA championship in Toronto.|$|R

5|$|Nevertheless, some Han {{literary}} sources provide crucial information. As {{written by}} Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> drive {{was first used}} for a quilling device which wound silk fibers onto the bobbins of weaver shuttles. The invention of <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> drive was a crucial {{first step in the}} development of later technologies during the Song dynasty, such as the chain drive and spinning wheel.|$|E

5000|$|BARREL helped {{study the}} Van Allen {{radiation}} belts {{and why they}} wax and wane over time. Each BARREL balloon carries instruments to measure particles ejected from <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> which make it down to Earth's atmosphere. [...] By comparing such data {{to that of the}} Van Allen Probes, which orbit with <b>the</b> <b>belts</b> themselves, <b>the</b> two missions may be able to correlate observations in <b>the</b> radiation <b>belts</b> with <b>the</b> number of particles ejected. This will help distinguish between various theories as to what causes electron loss in <b>the</b> <b>belts.</b>|$|R

5|$|Neptune's orbit has a {{profound}} impact on the region directly beyond it, known as <b>the</b> Kuiper <b>belt.</b> <b>The</b> Kuiper <b>belt</b> is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to <b>the</b> asteroid <b>belt</b> but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30AU out to about 55AU from the Sun. Much {{in the same way that}} Jupiter's gravity dominates <b>the</b> asteroid <b>belt,</b> shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates <b>the</b> Kuiper <b>belt.</b> Over <b>the</b> age of the Solar System, certain regions of <b>the</b> Kuiper <b>belt</b> became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in <b>the</b> Kuiper <b>belt's</b> structure. <b>The</b> region between 40 and 42AU is an example.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} GE invention by Tracy Hall uses <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> press {{wherein the}} upper and lower anvils supply the pressure load to a cylindrical inner cell. This internal pressure is confined radially by a belt of pre-stressed steel bands. The anvils also serve as electrodes providing electric current to the compressed cell. A variation of <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> press uses hydraulic pressure, rather than steel belts, to confine the internal pressure. Belt presses are still used today, but they are built on a much larger scale than those of the original design.|$|E
5|$|According {{to a story}} relayed by Bret Hart on the TSN sports show Off The Record, Hart was {{originally}} supposed to wrestle Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. However, the match did not happen because Hogan changed his mind, as he was supposedly {{not happy with the}} planned finish. As a result, Hogan lost <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> to Yokozuna at King of the Ring 1993 instead.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Scheer and Admiral Graf Spee {{had some}} {{improvements}} in armor thickness. The barbettes, 100mm thick in Deutschland, became 125mm {{for the two}} sisters. Admiral Scheer had <b>the</b> <b>belt</b> somewhat improved, and Admiral Graf Spee had a much more improved 100mm belt, instead of 50–80mm. The armored deck was improved as well, and some places had up to 70mm thickness.|$|E
