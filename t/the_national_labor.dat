5|$|As noted above, Section 7(a) led to {{significant}} increases in union organizing, as intended by the Act. But the enforcement of Section 7(a) and its legal limitations led to clear failures.

5|$|On May 25, 2001, {{the print}} edition {{announced}} {{the sale of}} the Washington Blade to Window Media, LLC, a group of gay publications. With the new ownership came several changes to standardize the paper with other Window Media publications, such as the return of editorials to the publication after being missing for several decades. Shortly after {{the sale of the}} paper, staff at the Blade sought a vote to unionize {{with the help of the}} Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Mexican league incident, Robert Murphy, a former {{negotiator}} for <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> Relations Board, attempted {{to organize the}} Pittsburgh Pirates into a guild for purposes of collective bargaining. Murphy decried the reserve clause in player contracts that gave team owners unlimited control over the player's services, and demanded more rights for players, including the right of contract {{and the right of}} salary arbitration. Chandler worked with Pirates officials to avoid a threatened strike by the players. Part of Chandler's intervention included organizing a team of replacement players as a contingency plan; the team would have included Honus Wagner, who was 72 years old at the time.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{has been}} criticized by liberals, such as when it {{excluded}} Communists from its leadership ranks, when it defended Neo-Nazis, when it declined to defend Paul Robeson, or when it opposed the passage of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> Relations Act. Conversely, it {{has been criticized}} by conservatives, such as when it argued against official prayer in public schools, or when it opposed the Patriot Act.

This organization was created in pursuit of equal representation for African Americans in the workforce. The labor union was organized by Isaac Myers, and elected its first president; civil rights activist Frederick Douglass was selected the president of the CNLU in 1872.

5|$|As {{the merger}} of the AFL and NFL became {{effective}} in 1970, the unions agreed to meet {{for the first time}} in January of that year. The NFL players wanted Ed Meador—who was the president-elect of the NFLPA prior to the merger—to become president of the newly combined association while the AFL players wanted Jack Kemp. The compromise was John Mackey of the Baltimore Colts, an NFL team before the merger, which was grouped with former AFL teams in the American Football Conference. The AFL players agreed to Mackey's election on the condition that former AFL player Alan Miller would become general counsel. Though the NFL owners were open to recognizing the union, their representatives requested lawyers not be present during negotiations, something the players were unwilling to agree to. This prompted the players to petition <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> Relations Board (NLRB) for union certification.|$|E
5|$|Derek Fisher succeeded Ewing as NBPA {{president}} in 2006. In early 2011, negotiations {{on a new}} CBA began. The league claimed that it was losing $300 million a year (22 out of 30 teams were losing money last season) and proposed to reduce 40% of players' salary (about $800 million) and institute a hard salary cap (at $45 million per team) {{as opposed to a}} soft cap (at $58 million) currently in use. The union disputed those figures and steadfastly opposed those changes. Hunter said that he was advising players to prepare for a lockout. In May 2011, the NBPA filed a complaint with <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> Relations Board (NLRB), accusing the league of negotiating in bad faith by failing to provide critical financial data to the union and repeatedly threatening to lock out players. The NBA quickly rejected the complaint, saying that the league complies fully with federal labor laws. The union also considered the option of decertification, which allows players to file an antitrust lawsuit against the NBA.|$|E
5|$|In early 1990, the drivers' {{contract}} from 1987 expired {{at the end}} of its three-year term. In March, the ATU began its strike against Greyhound. The 1990 drivers' strike was similar in its bitterness to the strike of 1983, with violence against both strikers and their replacement workers. One striker in California was killed by a Greyhound bus driven by a strikebreaker, and a shot was fired at a Greyhound bus. During the strike by its 6,300 drivers, Greyhound idled much of its fleet of 3,949 buses and cancelled 80% of its routes. At the same time, Greyhound was having to contend with the rise of low-cost airlines like Southwest Airlines, which further reduced the market for long-distance inter-city bus transportation. Without the financial strength provided in the past by a parent company, the strike's lower revenues and higher costs for security and labor-law penalties caused Greyhound to file for bankruptcy in June 1990. The strike would not be settled for 38 months under terms favorable to Greyhound. While <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> Relations Board (NLRB) had awarded damages for unfair labor practices to the strikers, this liability was discharged during bankruptcy reorganization.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the financial crisis, Disney and his brother Roy started the company's first public stock offering in 1940, and implemented heavy salary cuts. The latter measure, and Disney's sometimes high-handed and insensitive manner of dealing with staff, led to a 1941 animators' strike which lasted five weeks. While a federal mediator from <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> Relations Board negotiated with the two sides, Disney accepted an offer from the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs to make a goodwill trip to South America, ensuring he was absent during a resolution he knew would be unfavorable to the studio. As {{a result of the}} strikeand the financial state of the companyseveral animators left the studio, and Disney's relationship with other members of staff was permanently strained as a result. The strike temporarily interrupted the studio's next production, Dumbo (1941), which Disney produced in a simple and inexpensive manner; the film received a positive reaction from audiences and critics alike.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Sunkist v. Sunkist and Quaker Oats Co. v. General Mills, the court created a long-standing {{precedent}} in their decision {{making it possible for}} different companies to use the same brand and product name as long as they produced dissimilar products. In another case, the court set a short-lived precedent allowing companies to artificially raise prices in local markets if the purpose was to artificially lower prices in another market to remain competitive. After Minton joined the U.S. Supreme Court, the decision was appealed to that body; Minton recused himself from the case, which the court decided to overturn. In another decision, Minton was in the majority that ruled under the Sherman Antitrust Act that the New York Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company was a monopoly, ordering the company to break up its grocery business. Minton was also in the majority in several cases filed to enforce decisions made by <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> Relations Board, usually to end worker strikes.|$|E
5|$|Senator Robert F. Wagner {{proposed}} <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> Relations Act in 1935, which empowered {{workers to}} unionize. Ironically, the ACLU, after 15 years of fighting for workers' rights, initially opposed the act (it later took no {{stand on the}} legislation) because some ACLU leaders feared the increased power the bill gave to the government. The newly formed National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) posed a dilemma for the ACLU, because in 1937 it issued an order to Henry Ford, prohibiting Ford from disseminating anti-union literature. Part of the ACLU leadership habitually took the side of labor, and that faction supported the NLRB's action. But part of the ACLU supported Ford's right to free speech. ACLU leader Arthur Garfield Hays proposed a compromise (supporting the auto workers union, yet also endorsing Ford's right to express personal opinions), but the schism highlighted a deeper divide that would become more prominent {{in the years to}} come.|$|E

5|$|The Act was {{implemented}} by the NRA and the Public Works Administration (PWA). Very large numbers of regulations were generated under the authority granted to the NRA by the Act, {{which led to a}} significant loss of political support for Roosevelt and the New Deal. The NIRA was set to expire in June 1935, but in a major constitutional ruling the U.S. Supreme Court held Title I of the Act unconstitutional on May 27, 1935, in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). The National Industrial Recovery Act is widely considered a policy failure, both in the 1930s and by historians today. Disputes over the reasons for this failure continue. Among the suggested causes are that the Act promoted economically harmful monopolies, that the Act lacked critical support from the business community, and that it was poorly administered. The Act encouraged union organizing, which led to significant labor unrest. The NIRA had no mechanisms for handling these problems, which led Congress to pass <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> Relations Act in 1935. The Act was also a major force behind a major modification of the law criminalizing making false statements.|$|E
5|$|The NLRB {{applied a}} right it had {{recently}} announced in Quality Mfg. Co. and then clarified in Mobil Oil Corp. that employees in unionized workplaces {{had a right}} under Section 7 of <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> Relations Act (NLRA) {{to the presence of}} a union representative during any inquiry where the employee's job might be in jeopardy. The NLRB had explained in those decisions that having a union representative present was an exercise of the right to the 'mutual aid and protection' protected by Section 7. Therefore, an employer's refusal of such presence was an unfair labor practice and actionable under the NLRA. As a result, the NLRB found that Weingarten had engaged in an unfair labor practice by refusing Collins a representative and Weingarten appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1938, {{when there}} was a pending hearing and lawsuit alleging unfair labor {{practices}} by the studios against directors, Briskin was chosen to be one of three producers representing the studios, alongside Darryl Zanuck and E. J. Mannix. Sitting across the table were W. S. Van Dyke, Howard Hawks, and Briskin's friend, Frank Capra. In 1939, Briskin was once again involved in potential legal proceedings, being {{one of a number of}} producers who were called to testify before <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> Relations Board, regarding alleged infractions by the studios against the Screen Writers Guild (SWG). During the hearings, it was alleged that Briskin had opposed the proposed merger between the SWG and the Authors Guild. After the outbreak of hostilities in Europe and Asia at the beginning of World War II, AMPAS created the Motion Picture Defense Committee, which was a sub-committee of the organization's Research Council. Headed by the council's chairman, Darryl F. Zanuck, Briskin was one of several producers named to the committee. The group was formed to advise various arms of the U.S. government in the creation and production of training films. Shortly after the committee's formation, it was decided that the facilities of Hollywood film studios would be made available to the army to use for filming and production. In mid-November 1940 Briskin, along with the committee's chair Major Nathan Levinson, participated in interviews with members of the Screen Writers Guild, in order to select writers to go to Monmouth, New Jersey to work with army personnel on developing scripts for training films.|$|E

25|$|The NLRB recognizes {{a breach}} of the duty of fair {{representation}} {{as a violation of}} <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Labor</b> Relations Act.
