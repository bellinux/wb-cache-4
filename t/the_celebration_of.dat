5|$|During the English Civil War Manchester {{strongly}} favoured the Parliamentary interest. Although not long-lasting, Cromwell granted it {{the right}} to elect its own MP. Charles Worsley, who sat for the city for only a year, was later appointed Major General for Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire during the Rule of the Major Generals.

His property was restored and the ecclesia elected him supreme commander of land and sea (strategos autokrator).|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1524, Bucer {{concentrated}} on the main issue dividing leading reformers, the eucharist. In this dispute, he attempted to mediate between Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli. The two theologians disagreed on whether the body and blood of Christ were physically present within the elements of bread and wine during <b>the</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> the Lord's Supper. Luther believed in a corporeal or physical real presence of Christ; and Zwingli believed Christ's body and blood where made present by the Holy Spirit. By late 1524, Bucer had abandoned the idea of corporeal real presence and, after some exegetical studies, accepted Zwingli's interpretation. However, {{he did not believe}} the Reformation depended on either position but on faith in Christ, other matters being secondary. In this respect he differed from Zwingli.|$|E
5|$|By 1935, {{unbeknownst to}} the public, Piłsudski had {{for several years}} been in declining health.

It was led by military personnel — former Legionnaires, members of the Polish Military Organization, veterans of the wars of 1919–21 — and by his political collaborators from his service as Chief of State and, later, Prime Minister and Inspector-General.|$|E
5|$|Cẩn's {{influence}} {{began to}} wane after his elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was appointed the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế. Thục overshadowed Cẩn and aggressively promoted Catholicism, {{which led to}} the banning of the Buddhist flag in 1963 during Vesak, <b>the</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> the birthday of Gautama Buddha. Cẩn's forces opened fire on a crowd who were protesting the ban, killing nine and precipitating the Buddhist crisis. Ongoing demonstrations intensified throughout the summer as the regime responded with increased brutality, sparking the toppling of the Diem regime in a November 1963 coup. Cẩn had been offered asylum by the US Department of State, but ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. had CIA agent Lucien Conein arrest the fallen Ngô in Saigon. Cẩn was turned over to the military junta, which tried and executed him in 1964.|$|E
