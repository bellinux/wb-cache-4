25|$|The {{context of}} the sonnets vary, but the first 126, amongst which sonnet 54 is found, are {{addressed}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> of good social status and profess the narrator's platonic love. The love is returned, {{and the young man}} seems to yearn for the sonnets, as seen in sonnets 100-103 where the narrator apologizes for the long silence. However, Berryman suggests {{that it is impossible to}} determine how the relationship ended up. While theories exist that the sonnets were written as literary exercises, H. C. Beeching suggests that they were written for a patron and not originally intended to be published together.|$|E

Grey later committed suicide when Blanche told him she was disgusted with him. The story touches Mitch, who tells Blanche that they need each other. It seems certain that they will get married.|$|E

25|$|Bat Masterson {{became more}} widely {{known as a}} gunfighter {{as a result of}} a {{practical}} joke played on a gullible newspaper reporter in August 1881. Seeking copy in Gunnison, Colorado, the reporter asked Dr. W.S. Cockrell about mankillers. Dr. Cockrell pointed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> nearby and said it was Bat and that he had killed 26 men. Cockrell then regaled the reporter with several lurid tales about Bat's exploits, and the reporter wrote them up for the New York Sun. The story was then widely reprinted in papers all over the country. Cockrell subsequently apologized to Bat, who insisted he was not even in Gunnison at the time.|$|E
25|$|Shakespeare's sonnets are {{cited as}} {{evidence}} of his bisexuality. The poems were initially published, perhaps without his approval, in 1609. One hundred twenty-six of them appear to be love poems addressed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> known as the 'Fair Lord' or 'Fair Youth'; this is often assumed {{to be the same}} person as the 'Mr W.H.' to whom the sonnets are dedicated. The identity of this figure (if he is indeed based on a real person) is unclear; the most popular candidates are Shakespeare's patrons, Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton and William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, both of whom were considered handsome in their youth.|$|E
25|$|Sonnet 110 {{is one of}} 154 sonnets {{written by}} the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. Sonnet 110 was {{published}} {{along with the other}} sonnets in the 1609 Quarto. The sonnet falls in place with the Fair Youth sequence of Shakespeare's sonnets, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. The mystery of the young man is still unknown today. However, there are many different theories by various scholars of who this young man may be. There has been much debate whether or not this sonnet was written about Shakespeare's disdain with the stage and actors. Whereas others have interpreted sonnet 110 as the poet confessing his love <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E

25|$|From 1932 to 1935, White {{lived in}} England, {{studying}} French and German literature at King's College, Cambridge University. His homosexuality took {{a toll on}} his first term academic performance, {{in part because he}} developed a romantic attraction <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> who had come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White dared not speak of his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women meant nothing to him sexually. That became White's first love affair.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{emphasized}} love {{as more of}} {{a spiritual}} rather than sexual connection. There is a possibility that other writings not associated with the Church over courtly love were made {{as a response to the}} Catholic Church’s ideas about love. Many scholars believe Andreas Capellanus’ work, De arte honeste amandi, was a satire poking fun at the Church. In that work, Capellanus is supposedly writing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> named Walter, and he spends the first two books telling him how to achieve love and the rules of love. However, in the third book he tells him that the only way to live his life correctly is to shun love in favor of God. This sudden change is what has sparked the interest of many scholars.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1931, Bradman seriously {{contemplated}} playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington. The media in England and Australia hotly debated {{the consequences of a}} move that would end Bradman's Test career. Bradman was advised by the Board of Control that if he played cricket in England in 1932, it would be another breach of his 1930 tour contract and therefore he would not be considered for Test selection if he went ahead with the deal. Public opinion divided: Australian cricket could not afford to lose him and some thought he was selling his birthright, but {{at the height of the}} Depression, working-class people empathised with Bradman. The opportunity to earn over £1000 per annum was very tempting <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> without a profession.|$|E

50|$|The college later disincorporated and {{merged with}} the state of California's Agricultural, Mining, and Mechanical Arts College to create the University of California in 1868. Durant was elected the first {{president}} of the University of California on August 16, 1870 and resigned only two years later in order to relinquish the position <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>younger</b> <b>man</b> (Daniel Coit Gilman). In 1873, the University of California moved to its new Berkeley campus.|$|R
25|$|It {{is rather}} universally {{accepted}} that {{a body of}} Shakespeare's sonnets, including 65, are addressed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> whose beauty the poems make known. The young man is like Caesar, then, in that Shakespeare recognizes the presence of feminine qualities in a man. But the common theme is more than recognition, it is an acknowledgment of tension created by that recognition. Especially by Cassius, Caesar is made out to be rather feminine, as is {{the young man in}} descriptions of his beauty. In that the speaker does not directly refer to the addressee of the sonnets as a man, and in that Brutus and the others find discomfort in Caesar's ruling ability because of his appeared weaknesses, shows that Shakespeare recognizes an anxiety about men with feminine qualities, or women with masculine qualities, like Queen Elizabeth, of whom Caesar {{may or may not be}} representative.|$|E
