40|$|Cover {{cropping}} systems {{may help to}} improve agroecosystems, through decreased soil erosion, improved soil fertility, promotion of beneficial insects and reduced weed competition. If these benefits are realized they can improve the sustainability of the system, as cycling, diversity, stability and capacity are enhanced. These changes bring the system to more closely resemble natural systems. Within three experimental years, hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), fall rye (Secale cereale L.), yellow sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.) were grown as cover crops with cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis), and compared to monoculture cauliflower. In {{an effort to reduce}} competition between the cauliflower and cover crops, the cover crops were either mowed or rototilled prior to transplanting the cauliflower. The effects of the cover crops on weeds, allelopathy, cabbage and <b>turnip</b> root <b>flies</b> (Delia radicum L. and D. floralis Fall.), beneficial arthropods and cauliflower yield were investigated. Monoculture and rototilled hairy vetch plots showed the highest number of weeds throughout the experiment. Mowed plots showed the lowest weed densities. None of the experimental treatments tested (rototilled hairy vetch, yellow sweet clover and white clover and mowed white clover) showed significant allelopathic potential.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effects of}} {{intercropping}} on the <b>turnip</b> root <b>fly,</b> Delia floralis Fall. (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), was studied in an intercropping system with cabbage (Brassica oleracea) and red clover (Trifolium pratense). Both the effects on egg laying, and the effect of natural enemies was studied. To overcome the problem of competition in the intercropping system, different understorey crops were evaluated with the aim to find species that have a low competitive force on cabbage. The possibility to minimize competition further with root pruning of the understorey species, was also investigated...|$|R
40|$|The <b>turnip</b> root <b>fly</b> (Delia floralis) is a pest insect in the {{northern}} temperate regions of the world. If uncontrolled, it can cause severe problems {{in the production of}} brassica crops. This thesis examines how intercropping of cabbage (Brassica oleracea) and red clover (Trifolium pratense) affects the different life cycle stages of D. floralis. Such knowledge about the mechanisms involved is needed for developing intercropping systems with optimal pest reduction. A field trial was performed in Umeå, northern Sweden (63 º 45 ’N; 20 º 15 ’E), to study the effects of intercropping on D. floralis oviposition behaviour, and the impact of predators and parasitoids on D. floralis in the field. Intercropping was found to reduce D. floralis oviposition compared with monoculture. Furthermore, analysis of the spatial distribution of eggs within plots showed that the difference in egg numbers was greatest close to the border between the cultivation systems. This indicates that the effect of intercropping can be enhanced if D. floralis is provided with an alternative oviposition site. Natural enemies, in this case mainly predators, significantly reduced the final pupal numbers of D. floralis but this effect did not differ between the cultivation systems. However, the study showed {{that it is possible to}} retain the predation pressure in intercropped systems despite lower predator activity-densities and D. floralis egg numbers. A greenhouse experiment was performed to investigate effects of intercropping on development of D. floralis at different larval and intercropping densities and to analyse different aspects of host plant quality in the same system. It was found that D. floralis pupal weight decreased in response to both intercropping and larval density. This impaired larval development is likely to be explained by changes in host plant quality, which included decreased biomass, lower root nitrogen levels, higher root fibre content and altered glucosinolate concentrations. Information on plant responses to herbivory in competitive plant systems can be valuable in identifying quality aspects that are negative for insect development, which may further improve pest insect regulation in these systems...|$|R
40|$|The <b>turnip</b> root <b>fly</b> (Delia floralis) {{lives in}} the {{northern}} hemisphere and is a major pest on Brassica crops. D. floralis can cause severe economical and production damage to Brassica crops if left uncontrolled. The main objective of this thesis was to test if pellets with cyanobacteria have a repellent effect on D. floralis and comparing its effect to another product with known effect, garlic granules (Ecospray Ltd, UK). If by chance the pellets themselves have an effect, they were added as a treatment. Field trials were performed in Ås, Norway to investigate whether cyanobacteria or garlic have a repellent effect on D. floralis. None of the treatments {{reduced the number of}} eggs D. floralis laid. Wind tunnel trials were performed at NIBIO, Ås, to see if the treatments had repellent effect in a more controlled environment. Adult females of D. floralis had 10 minutes in the wind tunnel, exposed to the same materials as in the field. No {{significant differences were found between}} treatments in the wind tunnel. GC-EAD trials were performed at NIBIO to see if the treatments induced any response on the antennae of D. floralis. Headspace was collected from; cyanobacteria, garlic, pellets with cyanobacteria and pellets without cyanobacteria. Samples were scanned with GCMS as to show which volatiles were present. For every trial, a new antenna was taken from D. floralis females > 7 days of age. There were no repeated antennal responses to volatiles from; pure cyanobacteria, pellets with cyanobacteria or pellets without. 3 different antennae showed responses to the same volatiles of garlic; Allyl disulfide, Allyl trisulfide, 3 -vinyl- 1, 2 -dithiacyclohex- 4 -ene and Undecyl acetate (ISTD). The GCMS results from the samples show, that in the process of making pellets with cyanobacteria some volatiles disappear. We can conclude from all the results that pellets with cyanobacteria have no repellent effect on D. floralis females...|$|R

The post-alighting behaviour exhibited by D. radicum and D. floralis infers that oviposition site selection is primarily based upon positive stimuli present on the leaf surface. Ranking of four genotypes of plants for antixenotic resistance to oviposition by D. radicum and D. jloralis {{was found to be}} the same for both fly species, tested in the laboratory (swede cv Doon Major, most susceptible; kale cv Fribor, most resistant) and varied x 80 (D. floralis) and x 5 (D. radicum). Field experiments showed that oviposition (which was dominated by D. radicum) varied x 2 between plant genotypes (swede cv Doon Major, most susceptible; swede cv GRL aga, most resistant). Testing of Brassica leaf surface extracts, applied to surrogate plants, indicated that leaf surface chemicals strongly influence the site of oviposition of D. floralis. Methanol soluble polar compounds are the most stimulatory element for D. floralis and a fraction which contained aliphatic glucosinolates stimulated oviposition strongly although glucosinolates were not the primary oviposition stimulant. Collaborative experiments indicate that "CIF" (cabbage identification factor) is probably present in this fraction. The concentrations of Brassica root sugars are generally reduced by the damage of both D. radicum and D. floralis and appear to influence larval development. The percentages of plant fibre and lignin in the roots of Brassicas rise following the damage of D. floralis. The concentrations of individual glucosinolates in Brassica roots arc radically altered by the damage of D. floralis and D. radicum. D. floralis damage resulted in a rise in the concentration of aromatic glucosinolates and a fall in the concentration of aliphatic glucosinolates. D. radicum damage generally resulted in an elevated concentration of both aliphatic and aromatic glucosinolates. There was no clear evidence that glucosinolatc profiles were associated with different levels of antibiotic resistance to D. radicum and D. floralis. GRL aga (SCRI breeding line) was consistently resistant to the oviposition and larval feeding of D. radicum and D. floralis both in the laboratory and in the field. It was shown that the use of end-of-season chemical analysis to assess the influence of plant chemistry on insect development or host plant resistance in field experiments and the use of damage indexes based on the percentage of a plant root damaged by D. radicum may be flawed...|$|R
