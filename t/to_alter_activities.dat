The {{present study was}} de-signed to determine whether organic DEP extract (DEPe) may target hepatic drug transporters that contribute {{in a major way}} to drug detoxification. Using primary human he-patocytes and transporter-overexpressing cells, DEPe was first shown to strongly inhibit ac-tivities of the sinusoidal solute carrier (SLC) uptake transporters organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1 B 1, 1 B 3 and 2 B 1 and of the canalicular ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux pump multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, with IC 50 values ranging from ap-proximately 1 to 20 μg/mL and relevant to environmental exposure situations.

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} widely {{accepted}} that macrophages are divided into M 1 “pro-inflammatory” macrophages and M 2 “anti-inflammatory” macrophages and an uncontrolled macrophage polarization {{plays an important role}} in the pathogenesis of different diseases. As the main substance of total glucosides of peony, paeoniflorin (PF), {{has been widely}} used to treat autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases for years. Mechanistically, PF has been found <b>to</b> <b>alter</b> <b>activities</b> of many immune cells, which could further reduce inflammation and tissue damage. However, whether and how PF affects macrophages activities in vitro remains unknown. In current study, using M 1 and M 2 cells generated from mouse bone marrow precursors, we explored the role of PF in regulating M 1 /M 2 cells activity in vitro. The results showed that PF inhibited LPS-induced M 1 activity by reducing iNOS expression and NO production via decreasing LPS/NF-κB signaling pathway; whereas, PF enhanced IL- 4 -provoked M 2 function by up-regulating Arg- 1 production and activity via increasing IL- 4 /STAT 6 signaling pathway. Our new finding indicates that PF can suppress M 1 cells activity and enhance M 2 cells function simultaneously, which could help to ameliorate autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases in clinical treatment...|$|E
40|$|Puppetry is an {{exciting}} and very useful art form in the classroom. Simple, easily made puppets can {{become a part of}} most any lesson. Although puppet activities are usually associated with the language arts program, puppetry can also be used effectively in teaching mathematics. In the very act of constructing puppets, for example, children can learn much about area, length, width, volume, and other mathematical concepts. Children can use their completed puppets in imaginative play on their own, or guided by their teacher. Skits and poems can be created to use with their puppets. All of these play experiences will help {{in the development of a}} mathematics vocabulary. The intent of this paper is to give teachers puppetry activities that can be used with children to teach certain mathematical concepts. In some activities, the teacher makes the puppets and uses them in a lesson she is presenting to her class. Other activities require the children to construct puppets with some purpose in mind. The emphasis in the puppetry is either on puppet construction or puppet manipulation: sometimes both. Information on the child's developmental stages is also included so that the teacher has an idea when to use certain suggested activities, or how <b>to</b> <b>alter</b> <b>activities</b> to fit the needs of her students.

This study was carried out to investigate whether treatment with paroxetine and venlafaxine modifies the immune function in OCD and whether this modification is related to treatment outcome. METHODS: Ex vivo production of TNF-alpha, IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 10, and IFN-gamma in whole blood cultures, and NK-cell activity and peripheral blood NK-cell-, monocytes-, T-cell-, and B-cell- percentages were measured in 42 outpatients with OCD who participated in a 12 -week, double-blind SRI trial.

Responders, defined as having a >or= 25 % decrease on the Y-BOCS, differed from non-responders with regard to the change of TNF-alpha values.

The pyrethroids allethrin and tetramethrin were found to inhibit various ABC and SLC drug transporters, including multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) 2, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP) 1 B 1, organic anion transporter (OAT) 3, multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter (MATE) 1, organic cation transporter (OCT) 1 and OCT 2, with IC 50 values however ranging from 2. 6 muM (OCT 1 inhibition by allethrin) to 77. 6 muM (OAT 3 inhibition by tetramethrin) and thus much higher than pyrethroid concentrations (in the nM range) reached in environmentally pyrethroid-exposed humans. By contrast, allethrin and tetramethrin cis-stimulated OATP 2 B 1 activity and failed <b>to</b> <b>alter</b> <b>activities</b> of OATP 1 B 3, OAT 1 and MATE 2 -K, whereas P-glycoprotein activity was additionally moderately inhibited.
