40|$|Global pitch {{pyrolysis}} kinetic parameters {{determined by}} different methods from single thermogravimetric curves are compared. Differential (Freeman–Carroll, Vachuška–Vobořil), integral (Coats–Redfern, Horowitz–Metzger) and {{the method of}} direct non-linear regression (NLR) were used. Direct non-linear regression is the most suitable when the whole kinetic <b>triplet</b> (<b>activation</b> energy, frequency factor and reaction order) is searched, but the results are not quite satisfactory. If the global first order kinetic of pitch pyrolysis is accepted, similar values of activation energy and frequency factor were obtained by different methods.

40|$|International audienceThe kinetic parameters, {{namely the}} <b>triplet</b> <b>activation</b> energy EA, model {{function}} f(alpha) or g(alpha) and pre-exponential factor A of the oxidation of Constantan tapes in 1 atm of oxygen have been determined from both isothermal and non-isothermal thermogravimetry. For isothermal experiments, with temperatures ranging from 650 degrees C to 900 degrees C, {{the results from}} direct conversion of the weight increase {{as a function of}} the time and curve fitting, are compared with the isoconversion method. For the non-isothermal experiments, with heating rates from 1 degrees C/min to 20 degrees C/min, comparison is made between the Friedman differential method and the integral methods of Kissinger, Ozawa and Li and Tang. All methods give apparent activation energies with relative standard deviations as low as 3 %. The results converge to the identification of three stages in the oxidation behaviour. A parabolic law for reaction extents alpha below 15 % with E-A = 246 +/- 7 kJ mol(- 1), In A = 14. 3, is followed by two linear stages with E-A = 244 +/- 4 kJ mol(- 1) and In A= 15. 3 for 0. 18 45 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Adsorption {{characteristics}} of pure gases N 2 and O 2 on various silver exchanged low silica X-type (AgxLi 96 -x-LSX) zeolites were investigated. The equilibrium adsorption isotherms of N 2 and O 2 were measured at 273 and 298 K. Textual and structural properties of parent and resultant AgxLi 96 -x-LSX {{were characterized by}} XRD, BET surface area, and SEM techniques. Kinetics of their thermal dehydration were studied by exploiting thermogravimetric and differential data (TG-DTG) obtained at three heating rates (5, 10 and 15 K) using two model-free (Kissinger and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa) and one model fitting (Coats-Redfern) methods. Forty one mechanism functions were used to evaluate kinetic <b>triplet</b> (<b>activation</b> energy, frequency factor, and most probable mechanism/model) for different stages of dehydration. Results revealed {{that the impact of}} very small content of silver on the adsorption of N 2 is pronounced and attributed to weak chemical bonds formed between N 2 and Ag+ clusters due to strong adsorption of N 2 at low pressure, whereas O 2 adsorption is affected to a negligible extent. In addition, the N 2 /O 2 adsorption selectivity shows unexpected low values for Ag 87. 08 Li 7. 94 Na 0. 98 -LSX with higher Ag+ content (91. 00 %), which might be due to low crystalline water content as well as Ag+ clusters located at SIII sites. N 2 adsorption strongly depends on temperature as higher adsorption occurs at low temperature 273 K as compared to 298 K...|$|E

40|$|This thesis treats a {{particular}} flame retardant (FR) {{system with a}} new kinetic analysis method derived from the method of Invariant Kinetic Parameters (IKP). The IKP method {{is one of many}} techniques available that extract a kinetic <b>triplet</b> (<b>activation</b> energy, pre-exponential factor and function of conversion) from non-isothermal, constant heating rate thermogravimetric (TG) data. The principles and advantages of the IKP method are discussed within a broad context, as are its limitations that are shared by most other methods. Such a consolidated and critical literature review is uncommon and is designed to help the novice researcher navigate through the kinetic analysis “minefield”. Each and every step for all solid-state mechanism derivations are explained for the same purpose: To encourage the adoption of an informed and circumspect approach to often complex heterogenous kinetic analysis. The new method improves kinetic analysis outcomes and reliability by, in part, refining the IKP. Its approach is described in such detail that the inherent complexity of this undertaking can be fully appreciated, and if possible, managed in better ways. Subroutines written in Visual Basic for Applications in Excel to realise the method are validated with synthetic data up to a complexity of two overlapped independent models. Output from the method that pertains to water evaporation and the decomposition of calcium carbonate compares favourably with expectation. Statistical analyses are integrated into the method and allow for the proper treatment of uncertainty in all applications. Motivation for this study originated from a desire to characterise the commercial FR system, polypropylene/ tetrabromobisphenol A bis(2, 3 -dibromopropyl ether) / antimony trioxide. No thorough analyses of this FR system previously existed. TG data nominally for input into the new method is correlated with differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and the implications of these small-scale analytical techniques are illustrated with larger-scale cone calorimetry. Benson’s Group Additivity Method applied to a characteristic exothermic weight loss during the thermal decomposition of the pure FR complements the results of the new kinetic analysis method. A proposed degradation pathway is affiliated with the nucleation and nucleus growth model of statistical significance implied as the first of three overlapped independent processes that match the pyrolysis behaviour of the FR. The synergistic effect of antimony trioxide derives from its ability to make bromine from the FR overcome the diffusive resistance of the polypropylene substrate and enter the gas phase prior to ignition. It is concluded that the FR system behaves as might have been expected from a careful interpretation of the literature. Thesis (Ph. D.)

30|$|On the singlet PES, the {{formation}} of metalla- 2 -oxetane- 4 -one, B 10 /s (Fig.  2) is concerted. The activation barrier and endothermicity of the process are 44.8 and 4.7  kcal/mol. On the triplet surface, the carbon atom adjacent the carbonyl carbon of the C=C=O attacks an oxo ligand of ReO 3 CH 3 to form the intermediate X/t through a triplet transition state TS-[B 1 –X]/t.

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} {{study of}} heptahelical G protein-coupled re-ceptors (GPCRs), the precise mechanism of G protein activa-tion is unknown. The role of one highly conserved stretch of residues, the amino acids glutamic acid/aspartic acid–arginine– tyrosine (i. e., the E/DRY motif), has received considerable at-tention {{with respect to}} regulating GPCR conformational states. In the consensus view, glutamic acid/aspartic acid maintains the receptor in its ground state, because mutations frequently induce constitutive activity (CA). This hypothesis has been con-firmed by the rhodopsin ground-state crystal structure and by computational modeling approaches. However, some class A GPCRs are resistant to CA, suggesting alternative roles for the glutamic acid/aspartic acid residue and the E/DRY motif. Here, we propose two different subgroups of receptors within class A GPCRs that make different use of the E/DRY motif, indepen-dent of the G protein type (Gs, Gi, or Gq) to which the receptor couples. In phenotype 1 receptors, nonconservative mutations of the glutamic acid/aspartic acid–arginine residues, besides inducing CA, increase affinity for agonist binding, retain G protein coupling, and retain an agonist-induced response. In contrast, in second phenotype receptors, the E/DRY motif is more directly involved in governing receptor conformation and G protein coupling/recognition. Hence, mutations of the glu-tamic acid/aspartic acid residues do not induce CA. Con-versely, nonconservative mutations of the arginine of the E/DRY motif always impair agonist-induced receptor responses and, generally, reduce agonist binding affinity. Thus, {{it is essential to}} look beyond the rhodopsin ground-state model of conforma-tional activation to clarify the role of this highly conserved <b>triplet</b> in GPCR <b>activation</b> and function.

40|$|Abstract[3 -vinyl]- 132 -OH-bacteriochlorophyll a {{has been}} {{selectively}} exchanged against native bacteriochlorophyll a in the monomer binding sites at the A- and B-branch of the photosynthetic reaction centre from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Transient absorption difference measurements {{were performed on}} these samples over a temperature range from 4. 2 to 300 K with 20 ns time resolution. Specifically the decay of the primary donor triplet state, 3 P 870, {{as well as the}} rise and decay rates of the carotenoid triplet state, 3 Car (spheroidene), were measured. The observed rates revealed a thermally activated carotenoid triplet formation corresponding to the decay of the primary donor <b>triplet</b> state. The <b>activation</b> energies for the triplet energy transfer process were 100 (± 10) cm− 1 for reaction centers from wild-type Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2. 4. 1, with and without exchange of the monomeric bacteriochlorophyll on the electron transfer-active branch, BA. For reaction centers from Rhodobacter sphaeroides R 26. 1 with both monomers exchanged against [3 -vinyl]- 132 -OH-bacteriochlorophyll a, and subsequent spheroidene reconstitution the activation energy was 460 (± 20) cm− 1. These activation energies correspond to the energy difference between the triplet states of the accessory BChl monomer, BB, and the primary donor when native BChl a or [3 -vinyl]- 132 -OH-BChl a is present in the BB binding site. In all samples the 3 Car formation rates were bi-phasic over a large temperature range. A fast temperature-independent rate was observed on the wavelength of the carotenoid triplet–triplet absorption which dominated at very low temperatures. Additionally, a slower temperature-independent 3 Car formation rate was observed at low temperatures which could be explained with the assumption of heterogeneity in the energy barrier (3 BB) and/or the primary donor triplet state (3 P 870). A tunneling mechanism as proposed earlier by Kolaczkowski (PhD thesis, Brown University, 1989) is not only unnecessary but also incompatible with the available experimental data...|$|R

The halide exchange of Br- by I- can be easily performed, giving rise to compounds of the type [Ni(eta(3) -C 3 H 5) (Im) I]. The new complexes [Ni(eta(3) -C 3 H 5) ((t) Bu(2) Im) Br] (1), [Ni(eta(3) -C 3 H 5) (Me(4) Im) Br] (2), [Ni(eta(3) -C 3 H 5) (Me(2) Im) Br] (3), [Ni(eta(3) -C 3 H 5) (Me(2) Im) I] (4), and [Ni(eta(3) -C 3 H 5) (Me(4) Im) I] (5) were obtained in good yields and were fully characterized by elemental analysis and NMR spectroscopy. The X-ray crystal structures of 1, 2, 4, and 5 reveal a square-planar geometry at the nickel atom and a tilt angle of the NHC ring (in relation to the Ni square plane) dependent on the bulkiness of both the N substituents and the halogen bound to Ni. Variable-temperature NMR experiments in solution show that compounds 1 - 5 are stereochemically nonrigid. Three simultaneous dynamic processes are observed with increasing temperature: (a) NHC rotation about the nickel-carbon bond, starting at lower temperatures (Delta G(#) = 14 - 18 kcal mol(- 1) for compounds 2 - 5), (b) allyl rotation about the Ni-eta(3) -allyl axis, which is responsible for the cis-trans isomerization observed at intermediate temperatures (Delta G(#) = 16. 4 kcal mol(- 1) for compound 4), and (c) pi-sigma-pi allyl isomerization, occurring at higher temperatures. DFT calculations were performed in order to elucidate the possible mechanisms involved and suggest (1) NHC rotation is mainly controlled by steric factors imposed by the N-substituent groups {{and to a lesser extent}} by the halogen and (2) there is a "spin-forbidden" mechanism for eta(3) -allyl rotation, involving spin singlet and <b>triplet</b> species.
