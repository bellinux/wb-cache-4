5|$|In the meantime, the Council deposed John XXIII on May 29, 1415 {{and elected}} Pope Martin V on November 11, 1417; Martin V {{proceeded}} <b>to</b> <b>Florence</b> in February 1419. Cossa was ransomed by the Republic of Florence in 1419 (Louis III {{had abandoned the}} allegiance of Sigismund in 1417), as orchestrated by Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici. His ransom {{may have been a}} reward for past assistance <b>to</b> <b>Florence,</b> or a manoeuvre to put pressure on Martin V (still in Florence; he would arrive in Rome in September 1420), or both. Cossa had helped Florence conquer Pisa in 1405 in his capacity as Papal legate to Bologna and, as pope, had designated the Medici bank as the depository-general for the papal finances.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Constantinople in 1453, the codex was brought <b>to</b> <b>Florence</b> by an émigré scholar. It belonged to Niccolo Ridolpho († 1550) Cardinal of Florence. After his death it was {{probably}} bought by Piero Strozzi, an Italian military leader, for Catherine de' Medici. Catherine brought it to France {{as part of her}} dowry, and from the Bourbon royal library it came to rest in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris. The manuscript was bound in 1602.|$|E
50|$|In the 13th century, Siena was {{predominantly}} Ghibelline, {{in opposition}} <b>to</b> <b>Florence's</b> Guelph position (this conflict formed {{the backdrop for}} some of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, completed in 1320).|$|R
50|$|Upon his father's {{death in}} 1581, MacCarthy {{inherited}} substantial property {{but was not}} the prince's tanist (second in command and usually successor to the head), and therefore did not assume his father's title, which went <b>to</b> <b>Florence's</b> uncle, Owen MacCarthy Reagh, 12th Prince of Carbery. The position of tanist went <b>to</b> <b>Florence's</b> cousin, Donal na Pipi (Donal of the Pipes). But in 1583 <b>Florence</b> did go <b>to</b> court, where he was received by the queen, who granted him 1000 marks and an annuity of 100 marks. In 1585 {{he served as a}} member of the Irish Parliament at Dublin.|$|R
50|$|Following the war, {{the couple}} moved <b>to</b> <b>Florence's</b> {{home town of}} Chicago, Illinois, where their first two {{children}} were born. In 1948, Hargrave moved his family back to Evansville, where they had five additional children.|$|R
5|$|After the {{fighting}} in North Africa ceased in 1943, the 25th Battalion participated in the Italian Campaign, fighting in actions at Orsogna and later at Cassino. It finished the war in Trieste, and remained there to counter the presence of Yugoslav partisans that had entered the city. After {{the withdrawal of the}} partisans several weeks later, the battalion moved <b>to</b> <b>Florence</b> while its long-serving personnel began returning to New Zealand. Not required for service in the Pacific theatre of operations, the battalion was disestablished in late 1945.|$|E
5|$|In 1864 Ge {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Florence</b> {{and would}} paint not only Herzen's portrait {{but also the}} Messengers of the Resurrection and {{the first version of}} the Christ on the Mount of Olives. The new religious paintings at that time were not much of a success, and the Imperial Academy refused to exhibit them in its annual exhibition.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Florence,</b> {{where he}} rejoined the Guild of Saint Luke on 18 October 1503. He {{spent two years}} designing and painting a mural of The Battle of Anghiari for the Signoria, with Michelangelo designing its companion piece, The Battle of Cascina. In Florence in 1504, {{he was part of}} a committee formed to relocate, against the artist's will, Michelangelo's statue of David.|$|E

5|$|Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, died in May 1705. His successor, Joseph I, took to {{government}} with {{a burst of}} ebullience. Following the Battle of Turin, a decisive Imperial victory, the Emperor sent an envoy <b>to</b> <b>Florence</b> to collect feudal dues, amounting to 300,000 doubloons, an exorbitant sum; and to force Cosimo to recognise the Archduke Charles as King of Spain. Fearing a Franco-Dutch invasion, Cosimo III refused to recognise Charles's title, but he did pay {{a fraction of the}} dues.|$|E
5|$|Loring never enjoyed perfect health, {{and when}} he fell ill in Chicago and moved on doctor's advice to Minneapolis, his friend Loren Fletcher helped him become manager of the supply store for Dorilus Morrison's lumber business. Loring and Emily S. Crosman married in 1855. They had one daughter, Eva Maria, and one son, Albert C. Loring who managed {{businesses}} for his father. Emily Loring died on March 13, 1894. Loring remarried on November 28, 1895 <b>to</b> <b>Florence</b> Barton, daughter of A. B. Barton of Minneapolis.|$|E

5|$|Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, {{agreed to}} an {{audience}} with the Electress Palatine in December 1711. He concluded that the Electress's succession brought no quandary, but added that he must succeed her. Cosimo and herself were abhorred by his reply. Realising how unforthcoming he had been, Charles wrote <b>to</b> <b>Florence</b> agreeing to the project, mentioning but one clause: the Tuscan state must not be bequeathed to the enemies of the House of Austria. At {{the culmination of the}} War of the Spanish Succession, at the Treaties of Utrecht and Rattstatt, Cosimo did not vie for international assurances for the Electress's succession. An inaction he would later grow to lament.|$|E
5|$|Highway21 was {{the first}} King's Highway in Lambton County when it was assumed in 1927 between Highway3 at Morpeth and Highway7 at Reece's Corners. This {{original}} section of highway changed from a mudhole to a plank road circa 1860. When James Miller Williams, a Hamilton businessman, set out one day from during a drought to dig a well, he chose a spot downhill from an existing oil seep {{in the village of}} Black Creek. Instead of encountering water, Williams hit a shallow oil deposit. As a result of the ensuing oil-boom, which would begin the petroleum industry in North America, Williams laid out the village and changed its name to Oil Springs. Two competing plank road companies were formed, the Black Creek Plank Road Company (of which Williams was a principal investor) and the Sarnia <b>to</b> <b>Florence</b> Plank Road Company, both of which aimed their roads through Oil Springs. Although both roads were constructed, the former company was more prosperous in its endeavours; in 1886, {{a significant portion of the}} Sarnia <b>to</b> <b>Florence</b> Plank Road was closed up and turned over to local property owners. The Black Creek Plank Road Company meanwhile had transformed the muddy quagmire of a path into a well-maintained road. By 1863, three miles of road south of Wyoming had been paved, and the remainder south to Oil Springs planked (the Sarnia Road followed two years later). However, as the oil boom faded, so too did improvement to the road.|$|E

5|$|On 1 October, Galbraith {{informed}} Croatian President Franjo Tuđman of {{the plan}} without providing any details. Similarly, Ahrens and Eide informed RSK president Milan Martić. Although early Z-4 Plan negotiations were planned without actually disclosing the plan to Croatia and the RSK, elements {{of the plan}} were leaked to Belgrade and Zagreb newspapers in mid-October. According <b>to</b> <b>Florence</b> Hartmann, in October representatives of Tuđman and those of Serbian president Slobodan Milošević met in Graz, Austria to discuss the proposed reintegration of the RSK into Croatia and {{their opposition to the}} Z-4 Plan. Tuđman disliked the plan because it envisaged a Serb state in Croatia, while Milošević saw it as a dangerous precedent that could be applied to majority non-Serb or ethnically-mixed regions of rump Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo, Vojvodina and the Sandžak.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1918, the Wisconsin Highway Commission erected highway numbers along state-maintained roadways. The highway {{across the}} state from St. Croix Falls to Armstrong Creek was {{numbered}} WIS14 at that time. The remainder {{of what is now}} US8 was unnumbered secondary highways, and WIS14 continued north of Armstrong Creek <b>to</b> <b>Florence.</b> When Michigan numbered its highway system the following year, the future US8 {{was not included in the}} system. In Minnesota, US8 would follow what was Constitutional Route46, which was designated in a state constitutional amendment adopted on November 2, 1920; that roadway originally ran between Forest Lake and Chisago City through Wyoming.|$|E

Upon hearing of Anna Maria Luisa's intention to return, Violante Beatrice prepared to depart for Munich, her brother's capital, but Gian Gastone wished her to stay, so she did. To keep the two ladies from quarrelling over precedence, Cosimo III defined Violante Beatrice's status just before the Electress's arrival by appointing her Governess of Siena.|$|E
