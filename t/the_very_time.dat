5|$|For Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe Hermann Göring it was {{an ongoing}} concern that {{inadequate}} numbers of fighters were able to continually engage the bomber streams, at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>time</b> that the USAAF's 8th Air Force's new commander, Maj. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle had instituted a new fighter strategy against the Luftwaffe. Hence on 23 February 1944 — near {{the midpoint of the}} USAAF's Big Week bomber offensive against the Luftwaffe, also being carried out by the 15th Air Force flying out of Italian bases — Generalmajor Joseph Schmid Commander of I. Jagdkorps established a new rule for the fighters returning to base. They were to arrive at the nearest designated fighter airfield for resupply instead of returning to their own base. They were to be commanded by the senior pilot landing on that airfield, irrespective of their unit. This was meant to turn around the fighters in time to intercept returning bombers.|$|E

25|$|Although Cambodia had {{achieved}} independence by late 1953, its military situation remained unsettled. Noncommunist factions of the Khmer Issarak {{had joined the}} government, but pro-communist Viet Minh and United Issarak Front activities increased at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>time</b> French Union forces were stretched thin elsewhere. In April 1954, several Viet Minh battalions crossed the border into Cambodia. Royalist forces engaged them but could not force their complete withdrawal.

25|$|The {{cultural}} exchange between India and Japan was not direct, as Japan received Buddhism through Korea, China, Central Asia and eventually India. The Japanese discovered Buddhism in the 6th century when missionary monks travelled {{to the islands}} together with numerous scriptures and works of art. The cultural contact between Indian Dharmic civilization and Japan through the adoption of Buddhist ideas and aesthetic {{has contributed to the}} development of a national cultural order in the subsequent century. The Buddhist religion was adopted by the state in the following century.

25|$|Half {{a century}} of continual war and more than {{a century of}} depredations by privateers and pirates weighed heavily on the {{administration}} and defence of the Portuguese empire, spread as it was across Asia, Africa and America, and exhausted the Portuguese treasury. In 1640, Count-Duke de Olivares, royal favourite of Philip IV and prime minister of Spain, imprudently chose to levy a special tax upon Portugal in violation of its constitution, at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>time</b> when the Catalans, a merchant people like those of Lisbon, and also oppressed by Castilian taxes, {{were on the verge of}} armed rebellion. Then the prime minister of Portugal, Miguel de Vasconcelos, on the advice of the Spanish nobility, and with the complicity of the Portuguese feudal nobles, announced the Spanish minister's intention of abolishing the Portuguese Cortes, and of making the country a mere province of Castile with its own representatives in the Castilian Cortes. This provocation was the last straw for those Portuguese who desired the restoration of Portugal's independence.|$|E

In Kerr's private papers from September 1975, {{a month before the}} dismissal, Kerr had informed Prince Charles that he was considering dismissing Whitlam, and was concerned that his commission might be revoked by Whitlam to prevent it. According to Kerr, Charles had responded: [...] "But surely, Sir John, the Queen should not have to accept advice that you should be recalled at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>time</b> when you were considering having to dismiss the government". This information was also shared with Buckingham Palace because the Queen's Private Secretary, Sir Martin Charteris, wrote to Kerr that should this [...] "contingency" [...] arise, the Queen would try to delay things for as long as possible.|$|E
500|$|As a youth, Newton began {{a pattern}} of coming very close to death, {{examining}} his relationship with God, then relapsing into bad habits. As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, [...] "Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>time</b> when every other comfort was about to fail me." [...] His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary [...] "Polly" [...] Catlett, a family friend {{with whom he had}} fallen in love. After enduring humiliation for deserting, he managed to get himself traded to a slave ship where he began a career in slave trading.|$|E

He died shortly after turning eighteen, <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>time</b> most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease.

Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song is for you Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E

2500|$|In Pensiunea doamnei Pipersberg, Bonciu {{preserves}} his narrator persona and revives Ramses Sinidis.

The two then proceed to reconstruct the missing portions of Sinidis' life, an intertextual exercise in which protagonist advises writer how to best perform his task.

2500|$|The troops which Napoleon held thus in hand {{ready to}} launch as a {{thunderbolt}} against the weakened {{centre of the}} Prussian Line of Battle, were perfectly fresh, not having hitherto taken any part whatever in the contest, and were the flower of his army. It was this consciousness of the vantage ground he then possessed which, upon his perceiving the comparatively unoccupied space in rear of Ligny, cause him to comment to Gérard, [...] "They are lost: they have no Reserve remaining!". He saw that not another moment was to be delayed in securing the victory which was now within his grasp, and gave his last orders for the attack at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>time</b> when Blücher, whose right had just been strengthened {{by the arrival of}} the remaining three battalions of the 8th Infantry Brigade (Colonel Langkn's) (the Eighth), was making his dispositions for vigorously assailing the French army on its left flank.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Union Navy {{would provide}} {{most of the}} gunnery that {{would be needed to}} {{suppress}} the Rebel batteries, Burnside decided to have some gunboats under Army control. This immediately led to some interference between the two services. The Navy had no vessels sturdy enough to go to sea {{and at the same time}} draw little enough water to be able to pass through the shallow inlet, thought to be about [...] They therefore had to buy suitable merchant ships for conversion, at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>time</b> that Burnside and his agents were also dickering for their ships. Because the sailors were more experienced, they were able to get most of the more suitable ships. The Army was left with a mixed bag of rickety ships that were barely seaworthy. By the time the expedition got under way, the Navy had 20 gunboats, and the Coast Division had nine. The armada was supplemented by several canal boats converted into floating batteries, mounting boat howitzers and protected by sandbags and bales of hay. All told, the expedition carried 108 pieces of ordnance.|$|E
2500|$|Among the {{inhabitants}} of the House during the siege were a number of notable men of letters and the arts, some of them were Royalist soldiers and others as Royalist refugees from London. William Faithorne, a pupil of Robert Peake's father was one of the besieged, and has left a clever satirical engraving of Hugh Peters (an enemy at the gate), as well as many other fine portraits. Yet another engraver, and a still more famous one, was in the House, was Wenceslaus Hollar (see Virtue's Life of him) engraved a portrait of the Marquis. Other inmates were Inigo Jones, the great architect, and Thomas Fuller, author of the [...] "Worthies of England" [...] who {{is said to have been}} engaged on that work at <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>time</b> of the Siege, and to have been much interrupted by the noise of cannon. (History of the Holy Ghost Chapel, p.24.) Another man of letters found shelter at Basing House, where he lost his life, viz.
