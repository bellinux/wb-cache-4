5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the game, the Abyss-dwelling wizard brothers Garamon and Tyball accidentally summon a demon, the Slasher of Veils, while experimenting with inter-dimensional travel. Garamon is used as bait to lure the demon into a room imbued with virtue. However, the demon offers Tyball great power if he betrays Garamon. Tyball agrees, but the betrayal fails; Garamon is killed, but seals the demon inside the room. Because he lacks virtue, Tyball cannot re-enter by himself, and plans to sacrifice Baron Almric's daughter, Arial, at <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> gain entrance.|$|E

5|$|Despite this outburst, {{the studio}} liked him, and before his three-week {{contract}} was up—while {{the film was}} still shooting—they gave Cagney a three-week extension, which {{was followed by a}} full seven-year contract at $400 a week. The contract, however, allowed Warners to drop him at the end of any 40-week period, effectively only guaranteeing him 40 weeks income at a time. As when he was growing up, Cagney shared his income with his family. Cagney received good reviews, and immediately starred in another gangster role in <b>The</b> <b>Doorway</b> <b>to</b> Hell. The film was a financial hit, helping cement Cagney's growing reputation. He made four more movies before his breakthrough role.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 18th century, John Hylton (died 1712), {{the second}} son of Henry Hylton, de jure 16th Baron Hylton, gutted the {{interior}} {{to form a}} three-storeyed block (one room on each floor). He also inserted large, alternating, pedimented sash windows in the Italianate style and added a three-storeyed north wing to the castle (as seen in Bucks' engraving of 1728). A doorway to the new wing was added and approached by a semi-circular staircase. Above the doorway was a coat of arms, {{believed to be the}} one created to commemorate the marriage between John Hylton and his wife, Dorothy Musgrave.

The north front comprises a central three-storey fourteenth century pele tower with a taller circular stair turret and two-storey ranges linking {{it to the}} 1558 'Bess of Hardwick Building' {{to the left and}} a four bay 1858–1860 servants' wing of three storeys to the right. Windows to the pele tower and right-hand linking range are 15th century, of two cusped lights with hood moulds, some of which have been renewed, and some relocated from other areas. <b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> the tower dates from 1858–60. The windows to the left-hand linking range and the 'Hardwick Building' are four and six lights, with chamfered mullions. The two-storey 'Hardwick' range has diagonal offset buttresses. There are eighteenth-century battlements to the pele tower, with tall octagonal ashlar stacks.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> DIO's mansion is {{guarded by}} Terence T. D'Arby, younger brother of D'Arby the Gambler. His Stand, Atum, steals Kakyoin's soul after {{a round of}} video games, but despite D'Arby's mind games Jotaro is able to outwit him by having Joseph's Hermit Purple {{manipulate}} the games in his favor. Meanwhile, Polnareff, Iggy, and Avdol easily dispose of Kenny G, whose Tenore Sax Stand creates an illusory maze. Avdol is then killed by an invisible force that is revealed as DIO's henchman, Vanilla Ice, whose Stand Cream swallows itself into another dimension and instantly obliterates anything its sphere of destruction touches. Ice, who killed himself for DIO but was revived by DIO's blood, is able to nearly eliminate Polnareff, but a valiant sacrifice by Iggy allows Polnareff to ultimately win. Meanwhile, Jotaro, Joseph, and Kakyoin encounter Nukesaku the Idiot, but easily defeat him.|$|E
25|$|In Bayonetta 2, a {{few months}} after the events of the first game, Bayonetta and Jeanne are {{fighting}} an outbreak of angels when a supernatural summoning goes wrong and Jeanne is killed by Gomorrah. Bayonetta then sets out to rescue Jeanne's soul from a realm called Hell, heading to the sacred mountain of Fimbulvintr to find <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>to</b> Inferno. Arriving at the town of Noatun, she encounters a mysterious boy named Loki who serves as her guide to the mountain. She also reunites with Luka, who tells her about the legend of the deity Aesir, who created and ruled the human realm. During their journey, the pair is attacked by a masked Lumen Sage who targets Loki. When they reach the Gates of Hell, Bayonetta meets, Loptr, who is apparently working with the Masked Lumen and knows Loki very well. Through a vision, he reveals to her that her father Balder was not responsible for the witch hunts and he tried to save her mother. But Rosa was killed by an unknown assailant who looks like Loki. To escape their attackers, Bayonetta and Loki flee into Hell but the Masked Lumen follows them. Separated from the boy, Bayonetta fights through hordes of demons and successfully rescues Jeanne's soul. However, she finds Loki being attacked again by the Masked Lumen. Intervening, Bayonetta fights the Sage, who is revealed to be her father Balder at a young age. Balder had been targeting Loki for Rosa's murder. Suddenly, Loki unwillingly sends both Bayonetta and Balder back into the past during the Witch Hunts. Bayonetta meets her mother Rosa, and the two of them fight against the angels. During the battle, she fights a younger version of Loptr, and she realizes that he was Rosa's murderer and framed Loki for the crime. Later encountering Balder, the pair enter the Umbran Witch sanctuary to find that Loptr had killed Rosa. When he escapes, Bayonetta tells Balder that the killer was not Loki. She then opens a time portal and the two of them return to the present. With the help of Jeanne flying a fighter jet, Bayonetta and Balder set out for Fimbulvientr to confront Loptr, who has captured Loki. He reveals that he and Loki are the two halves of Aesir. When Aesir divided his power into the Eyes of the World, he split his soul into two: Loki being the good half and Loptr being the evil half. But Loptr decided to take back his power and become Aesir once again. Draining Loki of his power, Loptr takes the Eyes from both Bayonetta and Balder and transforms into Aesir. While the Witch and the Sage team up to fight Aesir, Loki uses his hidden power to erase the Eyes and weaken Loptr. Bayonetta and Balder defeat Loptr and split his soul from his body. When he tries to escape into the past to be reborn, Balder stops him by sealing the soul inside his body, despite Loki warning that it will corrupt him. Bayonetta tearfully bids farewell to her father as he is transported back into the past and becomes the corrupted Father Balder. As Loki begins to fade, he promises to Bayonetta that they will meet again when he is reborn.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} John Moffat and was erected to the South of Church Street. The architecture of the pro-cathedral was criticised for being inconsistent - each of <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> church were of different designs.

500|$|After the sea {{undermined}} {{the foundations of}} the Hoy and Anchor Inn at Reculver in January 1808, the building was taken down and the redundant vicarage was used as a temporary replacement under the same name. Although it was reported in 1800 that there were then only five or six houses left in the village, a new Hoy and Anchor Inn was built by 1809, and this was renamed as the King Ethelbert Inn by 1838.

With Tihiro Ohkawa he invented toroidal devices for containing the plasma with magnetic fields. The two completed this work at the University of Wisconsin, where Kerst was a professor from 1962 {{until his retirement in}} 1980. Their devices were the first to contain plasma without the instabilities that had plagued previous designs, and the first to contain plasma for lifetimes exceeding the Bohm diffusion limit.

500|$|The Entrance Hall, {{which is}} in the east range, was remodelled by Leoni.

A hinged picture can be swung out from the wall to reveal a squint looking into the Entrance Hall. [...] Also in the Entrance Hall are tapestries which were woven at Mortlake between 1623 and 1636. They were originally in the Leghs' London home in Belgrave Square and were moved to Lyme in 1903. In order to accommodate them, the interior decorator, Amadée Joubert, had to make alterations, including the removal of a tabernacle and cutting out four of the pilasters. To the south of the Entrance Hall is the Library, and to the east is Wyatt's Dining Room, which has a stucco ceiling and a carved overmantel both in a late 17th-century style, as well as a frieze.
