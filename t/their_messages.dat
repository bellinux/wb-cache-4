5|$|In the 19th century, the {{personal}} advertisements section in newspapers would sometimes {{be used to}} exchange messages encrypted using simple cipher schemes. Kahn (1967) describes instances of lovers engaging in secret communications enciphered using the Caesar cipher in The Times. Even as late as 1915, the Caesar cipher was in use: the Russian army employed it {{as a replacement for}} more complicated ciphers which had proved to be too difficult for their troops to master; German and Austrian cryptanalysts had little difficulty in decrypting <b>their</b> <b>messages.</b>|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{they would}} be killed if the Malagasy {{discovered}} the truth while still on board ship, the crew sealed <b>their</b> <b>messages</b> in bottles and dropped them into the onshore current. The VOC authorities in Cape Town had sent their chief ship's carpenter, Philip van den Berg, with two other ship's carpenters, two pilots, a quartermaster and 20 sailors overland. Carpenters were needed since neither of Meermin boats, now onshore, could be used: one {{was buried in the}} sand, and the other was in need of repair. The party from Cape Town had arrived by 6March, and, while Johannes Le Sueur was overseeing the carpenters' examination of Meermins boats, he was handed a bottle containing a message signed by Jan de Leeuw. A second bottle, containing a message signed by Olof Leij, was also found and handed to Le Sueur, and the fires were lit on 7March. One of the messages is preserved in the Cape Archives Repository.|$|E
5|$|The Skidi {{people of}} Native Americans saw {{the stars of}} Corona Borealis {{representing}} a council of stars whose chief was Polaris. The constellation also symbolised the smokehole over a fireplace, which conveyed <b>their</b> <b>messages</b> to the gods, {{as well as how}} chiefs should come together to consider matters of importance. The Shawnee people saw the stars as the Heavenly Sisters, who descended from the sky every night to dance on earth. Alphecca signifies the youngest and most comely sister, who was seized by a hunter who transformed into a field mouse to get close to her. They married though she later returned to the sky, with her heartbroken husband and son following later. The Mi'kmaq of eastern Canada saw Corona Borealis as Mskegwǒm, the den of the celestial bear (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta Ursae Majoris).|$|E
