5|$|A shell {{galaxy is}} a type of {{elliptical}} galaxy where the stars in the galaxy's halo are arranged in concentric shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach, the centers start <b>to</b> <b>oscillate</b> around a center point, the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over twenty shells.|$|E
5|$|To attract mates, some teleosts produce sounds, {{either by}} stridulation or by {{vibrating}} the swim bladder. In the Sciaenidae, the muscles that {{attached to the}} swim blabber cause it <b>to</b> <b>oscillate</b> rapidly, creating drumming sounds. Marine catfishes, sea horses and grunts stridulate by rubbing together skeletal parts, teeth or spines. In these fish, the swim bladder may act as a resonator. Stridulation sounds are predominantly from 1000–4000 Hz, though sounds modified by the swim bladder have frequencies lower than 1000Hz.|$|E
5|$|The slight {{eccentricity}} of Europa's orbit, {{maintained by}} the gravitational disturbances from the other Galileans, causes Europa's sub-Jovian point <b>to</b> <b>oscillate</b> around a mean position. As Europa comes slightly nearer to Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational attraction increases, causing Europa to elongate {{towards and away from}} it. As Europa moves slightly away from Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational force decreases, causing Europa to relax back into a more spherical shape, and creating tides in its ocean. The orbital eccentricity of Europa is continuously pumped by its mean-motion resonance with Io. Thus, the tidal flexing kneads Europa's interior and gives it a source of heat, possibly allowing its ocean to stay liquid while driving subsurface geological processes. The ultimate source of this energy is Jupiter's rotation, which is tapped by Io through the tides it raises on Jupiter and is transferred to Europa and Ganymede by the orbital resonance.|$|E

25|$|Radiofrequency Heating A {{radio wave}} {{is applied to}} the plasma, causing it <b>to</b> <b>oscillate.</b> This is {{basically}} the same concept as a microwave oven. This is also known as electron cyclotron resonance heating or Dielectric heating.|$|E
25|$|When {{the spark}} gap fires, the charged {{capacitor}} discharges into the primary winding, causing the primary circuit <b>to</b> <b>oscillate.</b> The oscillating primary current creates an oscillating magnetic field that couples to the secondary winding, transferring {{energy into the}} secondary side of the transformer and causing it <b>to</b> <b>oscillate</b> with the toroid capacitance to ground. Energy transfer occurs {{over a number of}} cycles, until most of the energy that was originally in the primary side is transferred to the secondary side. The greater the magnetic coupling between windings, the shorter the time required to complete the energy transfer. As energy builds within the oscillating secondary circuit, the amplitude of the toroid's RF voltage rapidly increases, and the air surrounding the toroid begins to undergo dielectric breakdown, forming a corona discharge.|$|E
25|$|Seiches {{have been}} {{observed}} on both lakes and seas. The key requirement is that the body of water be partially constrained to allow formation of standing waves.

50|$|Over {{the years}} of independence, {{increasing}} numbers of Estonians have chosen to work abroad, primarily in Finland, but also in other European countries, making Estonia {{the country with the}} highest emigration rate in Europe.

40|$|The {{vibration}} of a statically loaded, inherently compensated {{hydrostatic journal}} bearing due <b>to</b> <b>oscillating</b> supply pressure is investigated. Both angular and radial vibration modes are analyzed. The time-dependent Reynolds equation governing the pressure distribution between the oscillating journal and the sleeve is solved numerically {{together with the}} journal equation of motion to obtain the response characteristics of the bearing. The Reynolds equation and the equation of motion are simplified by applying regular perturbation theory for small displacements. The results presented include Bode plots of bearing oscillation gain and phase for a particular bearing configuration for various combinations of parameters over a range of frequencies, including the resonant frequency. The results are compared {{with the results of}} an earlier study involving the response of a similar bearing <b>to</b> <b>oscillating</b> exhaust pressure...|$|R
25|$|Flood basalt events {{occur as}} pulses of {{activity}} punctuated by dormant periods. As a result, {{they are likely}} to cause the climate <b>to</b> <b>oscillate</b> between cooling and warming, but with an overall trend towards warming as the carbon dioxide they emit can stay in the atmosphere for hundreds of years.|$|E
25|$|A {{comparator}} {{can be used}} {{to build}} a relaxation oscillator. It uses both positive and negative feedback. The positive feedback is a Schmitt trigger configuration. Alone, the trigger is a bistable multivibrator. However, the slow negative feedback added to the trigger by the RC circuit causes the circuit <b>to</b> <b>oscillate</b> automatically. That is, the addition of the RC circuit turns the hysteretic bistable multivibrator into an astable multivibrator.|$|E
25|$|Quartz clocks {{employ a}} crystal {{oscillator}} {{made from a}} quartz crystal that uses {{a combination of both}} direct and converse piezoelectricity to generate a regularly timed series of electrical pulses that is used to mark time. The quartz crystal (like any elastic material) has a precisely defined natural frequency (caused by its shape and size) at which it prefers <b>to</b> <b>oscillate,</b> and this is used to stabilize the frequency of a periodic voltage applied to the crystal.|$|E

40|$|We {{have found}} an {{oscillating}} instability of fast-running cracks in thin rubber sheets. A well-defined transition from straight <b>to</b> <b>oscillating</b> cracks occurs {{as the amount}} of biaxial strain increases. Measurements of the amplitude and wavelength of the oscillation near the onset of this instability indicate that the instability is a Hopf bifurcation...|$|R
25|$|Transient {{response}} is {{the reaction of}} a regulator when a (sudden) change of the load current (called the load transient) or input voltage (called the line transient) occurs. Some regulators will tend <b>to</b> <b>oscillate</b> or have a slow response time which in some cases might lead to undesired results. This value {{is different from the}} regulation parameters, as that is the stable situation definition. The transient response shows the behaviour of the regulator on a change. This data is usually provided in the technical documentation of a regulator and is also dependent on output capacitance.|$|E
25|$|Before neutrinos {{were found}} <b>to</b> <b>oscillate,</b> they were {{generally}} {{assumed to be}} massless, propagating {{at the speed of}} light. According to the theory of special relativity, the question of neutrino velocity is closely related to their mass: if neutrinos are massless, they must travel at the speed of light; however, if they have mass, they cannot reach the speed of light. Due to their tiny mass, the predicted speed is extremely close to the speed of light in all experiments, and current detectors are not sensitive to the expected difference.|$|E
25|$|These {{devices have}} been studied, and {{reviewed}} by Raman. Here we look primarily at the Hartmann whistle. The shock {{cells of the}} jet interact with the shock {{in front of the}} cavity (the flow in the cavity being subsonic). Small symmetric disturbances in the jet stream are amplified as they proceed toward the cavity (similar in some respects to the hole tone) causing the shock in front of the cavity <b>to</b> <b>oscillate.</b> The shock front acts much like a piston source of high energy resulting in a monopole-like sound field. Again the volumetric flow is directional unlike the theoretical monopole.|$|E
40|$|Various {{types of}} {{oscillating}} structures {{have been important}} for probing the hydrodynamic properties of quantum fluids since the discovery of superfluidity.

25|$|Modern designs use metal {{bell-shaped}} weights {{rather than}} Stockbridge's concrete blocks. The bell is hollow and the damper cable is fixed internally to the distal end, which permits relative motion between the cable and damping weights. To provide for greater freedom of motion, the weights may be partially slotted in the vertical plane, allowing the cable to travel outside {{the confines of}} the bell. In some installations, the weights are unequal, allowing damping over a greater frequency range. More complex designs use weights with asymmetric mass distribution, which enables the damper <b>to</b> <b>oscillate</b> in several different frequency modes.|$|E
25|$|In DC {{circuits}} and pulsed circuits, {{current and}} voltage reversal {{are affected by}} the damping of the system. Voltage reversal is encountered in RLC circuits that are underdamped. The current and voltage reverse direction, forming a harmonic oscillator between the inductance and capacitance. The current and voltage tends <b>to</b> <b>oscillate</b> and may reverse direction several times, with each peak being lower than the previous, until the system reaches an equilibrium. This {{is often referred to as}} ringing. In comparison, critically damped or overdamped systems usually do not experience a voltage reversal. Reversal is also encountered in AC circuits, where the peak current is equal in each direction.|$|E
25|$|The most revolutionary {{aspect of}} Planck's {{treatment}} of the black body is that it inherently relies on an integer number of oscillators in thermal equilibrium with the electromagnetic field. These oscillators give their entire energy to the electromagnetic field, creating a quantum of light, {{as often as they}} are excited by the electromagnetic field, absorbing a quantum of light and beginning <b>to</b> <b>oscillate</b> at the corresponding frequency. Planck had intentionally created an atomic theory of the black body, but had unintentionally generated an atomic theory of light, where the black body never generates quanta of light at a given frequency with an energy less than hν. However, once realizing that he had quantized the electromagnetic field, he denounced particles of light as a limitation of his approximation, not a property of reality.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the vector current {{contribution}} of neutrino interaction with electrons in ion gives rise <b>to</b> <b>oscillating</b> component, which is absent for the axial-vector contribution, when a single neutrino is detected in the recently proposed neutrino pair beam.

25|$|The {{control system}} {{performance}} {{can be improved}} by combining the feedback (or closed-loop) control of a PID controller with feed-forward (or open-loop) control. Knowledge about the system (such as the desired acceleration and inertia) can be fed forward and combined with the PID output to improve the overall system performance. The feed-forward value alone can often provide the major portion of the controller output. The PID controller primarily has to compensate whatever difference or error remains between the setpoint (SP) and the system response to the open loop control. Since the feed-forward output is not affected by the process feedback, it can never cause the control system <b>to</b> <b>oscillate,</b> thus improving the system response without affecting stability. Feed forward can {{be based on the}} setpoint and on extra measured disturbances. Setpoint weighting is a simple form of feed forward.|$|E
25|$|The OPO {{consists}} essentially of {{an optical}} resonator and a nonlinear optical crystal. The optical resonator serves to resonate {{at least one}} of signal and idler waves. In the nonlinear optical crystal, the pump, signal and idler waves overlap. The interaction between these three waves leads to amplitude gain for signal and idler waves (parametric amplification) and a corresponding deamplification of the pump wave. The gain allows the resonating wave(s) (signal or idler or both) <b>to</b> <b>oscillate</b> in the resonator, compensating the loss that the resonating wave(s) experience(s) at each round-trip. This loss includes the loss due to outcoupling by one of the resonator mirrors, which provides the desired output wave. Since the (relative) loss is independent of the pump power, but the gain is dependent on pump power, at low pump power there is insufficient gain to support oscillation. Only when the pump power reaches a particular threshold level, oscillation occurs. Above threshold, the gain depends also on the amplitude of the resonated wave. Thus, in steady-state operation, the amplitude of the resonated wave is determined by the condition that this gain equals the (constant) loss. The circulating amplitude increases with increasing pump power, and so does the output power.|$|E
25|$|Neutrino {{oscillation}} {{arises from}} a mixture between the flavor and mass eigenstates of neutrinos. That is, the three neutrino states that {{interact with the}} charged leptons in weak interactions are each a different superposition of the three neutrino states of definite mass. Neutrinos are created in weak processes in their flavor eigenstates. As a neutrino propagates through space, the quantum mechanical phases of the three mass states advance at slightly different rates due to the slight differences in the neutrino masses. This results in a changing mixture of mass states as the neutrino travels, but a different mixture of mass states corresponds to a different mixture of flavor states. So a neutrino born as, say, an electron neutrino will be some mixture of electron, mu, and tau neutrino after traveling some distance. Since the quantum mechanical phase advances in a periodic fashion, after some distance the state will nearly return to the original mixture, and the neutrino will be again mostly electron neutrino. The electron flavor content of the neutrino will then continue <b>to</b> <b>oscillate</b> {{as long as the}} quantum mechanical state maintains coherence. Since mass differences between neutrino flavors are small in comparison with long coherence length for neutrino oscillations this microscopic quantum effect becomes observable over macroscopic distances.|$|E
