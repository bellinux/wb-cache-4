5|$|Montgomery Ward, which {{acquired}} the Lechmere chain in 1994, closed {{the last of}} the Lechmere stores nationwide in 1998, as part of a corporate restructuring. After its closure, half of the former Lechmere was then converted to a home store for JCPenney, while the other half sat vacant until DSW Shoe Warehouse replaced it in 1999. Linens 'n Wares, which closed {{at some point in the}} late 1990s, was converted to a home store for Kaufmann's in 1999 as well. One year later, a Galyan's Trading Company store was added onto the mall as well, with <b>this</b> <b>store</b> being renamed Dick's Sporting Goods in 2004 following the acquisition of the Galyan's chain.|$|E
5|$|The alpine pika is a generalist herbivore, mainly {{foraging}} for mosses, trees branches, pine nuts, {{and plant}} stems, which it gathers {{during the summer}} to create haypiles for use in winter. These haypiles were estimated by I.V. Travina in 1984 {{to be as much}} as 30kg per hectare (12kg per acre) when the population density is around 10 to 12 individuals per hectare. <b>This</b> <b>store</b> would sometimes be shared with other species such as reindeer. In 1978, Khlebnikova documented the influence exerted by the alpine pika on plant diversity and composition in the regions they inhabit. These include reduced seed content of the soil, decreased ratio of flowering plants, and slow succession of plants such as the Siberian pine due to the pika's foraging on young trees. The remnants of the haypiles, however, might facilitate plant growth and the accumulation of pellets that create spots of nitrophilic vegetation (vegetation rich in nitrogen).|$|E
5|$|The {{decline of}} heavy {{industry}} in the 20th century left Windy Nook with no major employer and there was little {{in terms of economic}} activity. There is no major commercial area and residents usually travel to neighbouring Felling town centre to shop or use the small shopping area at the junction of Windy Nook Road and Carr Hill Road/Albion Street. However, in November 2011, planning permission was approved for conversion of the Black House Inn at the junction of Carr Hill Road and Coldwell lane into a 'Tesco Extra' store. The approval was granted in spite of complaints and concerns as to noise and traffic being raised by local residents. <b>This</b> <b>store</b> is now the largest employer in Windy Nook, employing around 20 staff.|$|E

25|$|Some {{out of town}} {{development}} has taken place with Morrisons constructing a store located just outside the town boundary, in the parish of Laceby. It is known as Morrisons Cleethorpes.

25|$|Harris, an {{employee}} of the A store on Central Avenue and Pecan that was Charlotte's first supermarket, borrowed funds in 1936 to open the Harris Super Market at 1704 Central Avenue. The store had eight employees. It was primarily a dry goods store because frozen foods and refrigeration did not become common until World War II. To the family and then employees, it was known as Store #1. <b>This</b> <b>store,</b> known as Harris Teeter store #201, closed on June 5, 2012, and was replaced by a two-story store #401 on the same site, which opened on May 29, 2013.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Berdella began renting his own {{booth at}} the Westport Flea Market. <b>This</b> <b>store</b> was named Bob's Bizarre Bazaar, and {{primarily}} sold and traded primitive art, jewelry, and antiques. Although occasionally making a generous monthly profit, the income he typically generated via this business was often not sufficient to maintain his daily expenses and to make ends meet. Resultingly, Berdella would occasionally have to either sell goods to fellow merchants at a profit loss, or steal or scavenge for items to sell at his booth. Additionally, he would often take lodgers at his home {{as a means of}} gaining additional income.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, {{many of the men}} who worked for Sainsbury's were called to perform National Service and were replaced by women. The Second World War was a difficult time for Sainsbury's, as most of its stores were trading in the London area and were bombed or damaged. Turnover fell to half the pre-war level. Food was rationed, and one particular store in East Grinstead was so badly damaged on Friday 9 July 1943 that it had to move to the local church, temporarily, while a new one was built. <b>This</b> <b>store</b> was not completed until 1951.|$|E

25|$|Asda {{had also}} {{neglected}} {{many of the}} older stores within its estate by not refurbishing them in line with other stores that had been refurbished and its more expensive new store sites. One example was the Astley Bridge, Bolton store which had been built in 1970. <b>This</b> <b>store</b> did not receive its first major refurbishment until 1993, and was until that point still trading with the old blue and orange Asda corporate logo and signage attached to the building in various positions, {{and there were many}} other stores like that. It meant that Asda had left the older, outdated unrefurbished stores in locations where competitors were opening new stores more vulnerable to losing customers to their shiny new rivals.|$|E
25|$|M {{has opened}} a number of stores at out of town {{locations}} since the trend to build shopping centres away from town centres became popular in the 1980s. The first was at the MetroCentre, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, which opened in 1986. Another notable example is the store at the Merry Hill Shopping Centre at Brierley Hill, West Midlands. <b>This</b> <b>store</b> opened on 23 October 1990 shortly after the closure of stores {{in the nearby town}} centres of Dudley and West Bromwich; the Merry Hill store was not originally intended to replace these two town centre stores, but both the Dudley and West Bromwich stores had experienced a downturn in trade as the opening of the Merry Hill store loomed, and both stores were closed on 25 August 1990.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, in October 1873, Field and Leiter {{returned}} to State Street at Washington, opening {{in a new}} five-story store at their old location they now leased from the Singer Sewing Machine Company, Palmer having sold the land site to finance his own rebuilding activities. <b>This</b> <b>store</b> was expanded in 1876, only to be destroyed by fire again in November 1877. Ever tenacious, Field and Leiter had a new temporary store opened {{by the end of}} the month at a lakefront exposition hall they leased temporarily from the city, located at what is now the site of the present Art Institute of Chicago. Meanwhile, the Singer company had speculatively built a new, even larger, six-story building on the ruins of their old 1873 store, which, after some contention, was personally bought by Field and Leiter. Field, Leiter & Company now reclaimed their traditional location at the northeast corner of State and Washington for the last time in April 1879.|$|E
