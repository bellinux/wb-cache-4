5|$|For {{internal}} broaching {{the sides of}} the broach are drafted inward so it becomes thinner; for external broaching the sides are drafted outward, to make the pocket bigger. This draft keeps the broach from jamming; the draft must be larger than the angle of misalignment. If the work piece rotates, the broach is pressed against it, is driven by it, and rotates synchronously with it. If <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> holder rotates, the broach is pressed against the workpiece, but is driven by <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> holder.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the field}} of {{environmental}} assessment tools for buildings is vast, {{the aim of this}} study is to clarify that field by analysing and categorising existing <b>tools.</b> <b>The</b> differences between <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> are discussed and the current situation within <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> is critically analysed. However, the comparison of <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> is difficult, if not impossible. For example, <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> are designed for assessing different types of buildings, and they emphasise different phases of the life cycle. In addition to environmental aspects, sustainable building includes economic and social aspects. The shift from green building to sustainable building and the future requirements are challenging for building environmental assessment <b>tools.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> benefits of using <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> should be analysed — how <b>the</b> <b>tools</b> and their results have affected decision making...|$|R
5|$|There is some {{spiraling}} of <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> as it cuts, so {{the form}} {{at the bottom}} of the workpiece may be rotated with respect to the form at the top of the hole or profile. Spiraling may be undesirable because it binds the body of <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> and prevents it from cutting sharply. One solution to this is to reverse the rotation in mid cut, causing <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> to spiral in the opposite direction. If reversing the machine is not practical, then interrupting the cut is another possible solution.|$|E

5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed built into <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are built into the broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E

25|$|The {{plunge depth}} {{is defined as}} the depth of the lowest point of the {{shoulder}} {{below the surface of the}} welded plate and has been found to be a critical parameter for ensuring weld quality. Plunging the shoulder below the plate surface increases the pressure below <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> and helps ensure adequate forging of the material at the rear of <b>the</b> <b>tool.</b> Tilting <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> by 2–4 degrees, such that the rear of <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> is lower than the front, has been found to assist this forging process. The plunge depth needs to be correctly set, both to ensure the necessary downward pressure is achieved and to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> fully penetrates the weld. Given the high loads required, the welding machine may deflect and so reduce the plunge depth compared to the nominal setting, which may result in flaws in the weld. On the other hand, an excessive plunge depth may result in the pin rubbing on the backing plate surface or a significant undermatch of the weld thickness compared to the base material. Variable load welders have been developed to automatically compensate for changes in <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> displacement while TWI have demonstrated a roller system that maintains <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> position above the weld plate.|$|E
