5|$|Final Fantasy Tactics {{is set in}} {{a fictional}} medieval-inspired kingdom called Ivalice, created by Yasumi Matsuno. The game's story follows Ramza Beoulve, a highborn cadet who finds himself <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> the middle of an {{intricate}} military conflict known as The Lion War, where two opposing noble factions are coveting the throne of the kingdom. As the story progresses, Ramza and his allies discover a sinister plot behind the war.|$|E
5|$|His {{wife was}} the target of an {{attempted}} assassination in Tucson, Arizona, on January 8, 2011. After the shooting, in which six people were killed, both Kelly and Giffords were <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> the media spotlight. His wife's shooting led to a broad national conversation ranging from the duties of a husband to what is acceptable civil discourse.|$|E
5|$|The game {{focuses on}} an amnesiac protagonist who awakens in a cave. Through his explorations, he discovers a plot by the Doctor, a {{megalomaniac}} who intends {{to force the}} inhabitants of the cave to fight for him in his bid to conquer the world. The protagonist is <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> the position of savior as he endeavors to defeat the Doctor.|$|E

5|$|Wisconsin, {{armed with}} heavy {{anti-aircraft}} batteries, performed escort duty for TF 38's fast carriers during {{air strikes against}} Formosa, Luzon, and the Nansei Shoto to neutralize Japanese forces there and to cover the unfolding Allied Lingayen Gulf operations. Those strikes, lasting from 3–22 January 1945, included a <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> the South China Sea, {{in the hope that}} major units of the Imperial Japanese Navy could be drawn into battle.|$|E
5|$|Burial customs, {{at least}} in {{southern}} Poland, included raising kurgans. The urn with the ashes {{was placed on the}} mound or on a post <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> the ground. In that position, few such urns survived, which may be the reason why Slavic burial sites in Poland are rare. All dead, regardless of social status, were cremated and afforded a burial, according to Arab testimonies (one {{from the end of the}} 9th century and another one from about 930). A Slavic funeral feast practice was also mentioned earlier by Theophylact Simocatta.|$|E
5|$|Even {{during the}} Cold War, the {{psychological}} {{impact of a}} battleship was significant. In 1946, USS Missouri was dispatched to deliver {{the remains of the}} ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and Greek waters staved off a possible Soviet <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> the Balkan region. In September 1983, when Druze militia in Lebanon's Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS New Jersey stopped the firing. Gunfire from New Jersey later killed militia leaders.|$|E
50|$|The first Soviet {{attack on}} the evening of the 18 September was repulsed by the Polish defenders. Subsequently the Soviets {{continued}} to push into Wilno. By {{the end of the day}} the Soviets had secured the airfield and made several <b>thrusts</b> <b>into</b> the city, taking the Rasos Cemetery.|$|R

5|$|The mid-11th century Gosforth Cross, {{located in}} Cumbria, England, has been {{described}} as depicting a combination of scenes from the Christian Judgement Day and the pagan Ragnarök. The cross features various figures depicted in Borre style, including a man with a spear facing a monstrous head, one of whose feet is <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> the beast's forked tongue and on its lower jaw, while a hand is placed against its upper jaw, a scene interpreted as Víðarr fighting Fenrir. The depiction has also been theorized as a metaphor for Jesus's defeat of Satan.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the length}} of time it took to build her, Wisconsin missed much of the initial <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> Japanese-held territory, having arrived {{at a time when the}} reconquest of the Philippines was well underway. As a part of that movement, the {{planners}} had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of Mindoro, south of Luzon. From that point, American forces could threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the South China Sea. In preparation for the coming invasion of Mindoro, Wisconsin was assigned to protect the 3rd Fleet's Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 38), as they conducted air raids at Manila to soften up Japanese positions.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy Tactics (1997), a {{tactical}} role-playing game developed {{and published by}} Square for the Sony PlayStation video game console, marked the first appearance of Ivalice. The game combined thematic elements of the Final Fantasy video game series with a game engine and battle system unlike those previously seen in the franchise. Final Fantasy Tactics {{is set in a}} fictional medieval-inspired kingdom called Ivalice and created by Yasumi Matsuno. The game's story follows Ramza Beoulve, a highborn cadet who finds himself <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> the middle of an intricate military conflict known as The Lion War, where two opposing noble factions are coveting the throne of the kingdom. As the story progresses, Ramza and his allies discover a sinister plot behind the war.|$|E

5|$|In late 1203, John {{attempted}} to relieve Château Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and water-borne forces, considered by most historians today {{to have been}} imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany {{in an attempt to}} draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.|$|E
5|$|Initially, in the KOR's tradition, Solidarity was an ostensibly non-political {{movement}} {{aiming at}} reconstruction of civil society. Suddenly <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> legal existence and prominence in 1980, Solidarity and the Polish opposition in general lacked a constructive program or consensus regarding further developments. In 1981, Solidarity accepted {{the necessity of}} a political role and helped form a broad anti-ruling system social movement, dominated by the working class and with members ranging from people associated with the Catholic Church to non-communist leftists. The union was backed by intellectual dissidents, including the KOR, and adhered to a policy of nonviolent resistance. According to Karol Modzelewski, the Solidarity of 1980–81 was permeated by the idea of brotherhood between intelligentsia and workers. In the areas of ideology and politics, Solidarity followed the lead of its associated opposition intellectuals.|$|E
5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses {{rock with}} trance. When Kawada debuted in 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy {{that she could be}} based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends, as well as to I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she felt that she would be <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always felt that she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{place on}} a fictional group of islands near Australia, Crash Bandicoot 2 follows the adventures of the {{anthropomorphic}} bandicoot Crash. Crash is abducted by series villain Doctor Neo Cortex, who has seemingly turned over a new leaf and wants to save the world. Crash is <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> several parts of N. Sanity Island in order to gather Crystals that will allow Cortex to contain the power of an upcoming planetary alignment and keep the planet from being destroyed. Crash is joined by his sister Coco, who is suspicious of Cortex's true intentions, and by Doctor Nitrus Brio, who tries to persuade Crash to gather Gems instead of Crystals.|$|E
5|$|The Gosforth Cross (920–950), in Cumbria, England, is a {{standing}} cross {{of a typical}} Anglo-Saxon form, carved {{on all sides of}} the long shaft, which is nearly square in section. Apart from panels of ornament, the scenes include a Christian crucifixion, and possibly another scene in Hell, but the other scenes are generally interpreted as narrative incidents from the Ragnarök story, even by a scholar as cautious of such interpretations as David M. Wilson. The Ragnarök battle itself may be depicted on the north side. The cross features various figures depicted in Borre style, including a man with a spear facing a monstrous head, with one foot <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> the beast's forked tongue and on its lower jaw, and the other is against its upper jaw, a scene interpreted as Víðarr fighting Fenrir.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> the Pacific region {{had begun}} in early December 1941 with attacks against British and Commonwealth forces in the Battle of Hong Kong and the Malayan campaign, and against the US Pacific Fleet, much of which was caught at anchor in Pearl Harbor. They rapidly {{advanced}} south, overwhelming resistance in Malaya, capturing Singapore in February 1942, and successfully occupying Timor, Rabaul and the Dutch East Indies. While a Japanese naval operation aimed at capturing Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea in May, elsewhere American forces in the Philippines capitulated, and Japanese forces advanced towards India through Burma.|$|E
50|$|About 159, the Limes was shifted about 30 km eastwards to the Miltenberg-Walldürn-Buchen-Osterburken line. In 260, Roman hegemony fell. The Alamanni {{were also}} <b>thrusting</b> <b>into</b> the Odenwald and {{settling}} the land between the Main and Neckar, after whom came the Franks. In the 5th century, the Franks, under Clovis I, divided the land up into districts.|$|R

5|$|The {{attacks on}} Lac Long and other {{outposts}} in Tây Ninh were a diversion designed {{to cover the}} main <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> Bình Long Province. To initiate the campaign in Bình Long, the Viet Cong's 5th Division (numbering about 9,230 soldiers) was ordered to take Lộc Ninh, Bình Long's northernmost town. The Viet Cong were supported by the North Vietnamese 69th Artillery Command (3,830 soldiers) and the 203rd Armored Regiment (800 soldiers). In 1972, Lộc Ninh was a small district town situated on Route 13, home to about 4,000 people, mostly members of the various Montagnard tribes. The task of defending Lộc Ninh was entrusted to the ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment, 5th Infantry Division, commanded by Colonel Nguyễn Công Vinh. It {{was supported by the}} 1st Cavalry Squadron, 1st Regional Force Battalion, and elements of the 74th Ranger Battalion.|$|E
5|$|The initial season {{had nine}} major roles receive star billing. Benjamin McKenzie portrayed protagonist Ryan Atwood, a troubled {{teenager}} who is <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> the wealthy lifestyle of Newport. Mischa Barton played {{the girl next}} door, Marissa Cooper, with Tate Donovan starring as her financially troubled father Jimmy. Adam Brody acted as geeky ostracized teenager Seth Cohen with Kelly Rowan playing his mother Kirsten, the powerful businesswoman, and Peter Gallagher portraying his father, Sandy, a public defense attorney. Chris Carmack portrayed Marissa's boyfriend Luke Ward. Originally only guest stars, Melinda Clarke starred as Marissa's mother, Julie Cooper, and Rachel Bilson played Summer Roberts, best friend to Marissa and Seth's object of affection. Both gained contracts to the main cast list after thirteen episodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was launched on 16 December 1944 and enjoyed initial success, but it quickly {{suffered from a}} lack of air cover and the inexperience in some of its infantry component, and critically short fuel supply. Sixth SS Panzer Army met heavy allied resistance, and while Fifth Panzer Army managed to make a deep <b>thrust</b> <b>into</b> Allied line, Model was unable to exploit the breakthrough there. He had failed to capture a vital road junction at Bastogne, and this in combination with poor weather and difficult terrain, caused the German columns to back up into huge traffic jams on the roads behind the front. Starved of fuel and ammunition, the attack had broken down by 25 December, and was abandoned on 8 January.|$|E
