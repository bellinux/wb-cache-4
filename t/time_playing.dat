5|$|In December 1878, Tesla left Graz and severed all {{relations}} {{with his family}} {{to hide the fact that}} he dropped out of school. His friends thought that he had drowned in the nearby Mur River. Tesla moved to Maribor, where he worked as a draftsman for 60 florins per month. He spent his spare <b>time</b> <b>playing</b> cards with local men on the streets.|$|E

5|$|After construction, Morris invited {{friends to}} visit, most notably Burne-Jones {{and his wife}} Georgiana, as well as Rossetti and his wife Lizzie Siddal. They aided him in {{painting}} murals on the furniture, walls, and ceilings, much of it based on Arthurian tales, the Trojan War, and Geoffrey Chaucer's stories, while he also designed floral embroideries for the rooms. They also spent much <b>time</b> <b>playing</b> tricks on each other, enjoying games like hide and seek, and singing while accompanied by the piano. Siddall stayed at the House during summer and autumn 1861 as she recovered from a traumatic miscarriage and an addiction to laudanum; she would die of an overdose in February 1862.|$|E
5|$|As a self-taught {{composer}} and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences {{led him to}} create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical composers such as Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, and Anton Webern, along with 1950s rhythm and blues and doo-wop music. He began writing classical music in high school, {{while at the same}} <b>time</b> <b>playing</b> drums in rhythm and blues bands; later switching to electric guitar. His 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention, Freak Out!, combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach, irrespective of whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz or classical.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{he could}} walk, Braille spent <b>time</b> <b>playing</b> in his father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E

5|$|Boycott {{told the}} BBC in 1965 that {{he chose to}} leave school at 17 because he no longer wished to be a {{financial}} strain on his parents, and {{because he wanted to}} pursue his cricketing career. He worked as a clerk in the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance in Barnsley from 1958 to 1963, at the same <b>time</b> <b>playing</b> for a number of cricket clubs. Boycott captained the South Elmsall district team, and achieved a batting average of 70. He also played for the Yorkshire Federation's Under-18 team, and for Barnsley, where he was noticed by Clifford Hesketh, a member of Yorkshire's County Cricket team committee.|$|E
5|$|Conroy {{left the}} Flames {{as a free}} agent {{following}} the playoff run, opting to sign a four-year, US$12 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings. He later admitted that he did not truly wish to leave the Flames, but facing financial uncertainty with the 2004–05 NHL lockout looming, Conroy chose to accept the guaranteed contract. The lockout wiped out {{the first year of the}} deal, but he returned in 2005–06 to reach the 20-goal mark for the third time and 60 points for the second time in his career. During that season, he joined the United States national team for a second <b>time,</b> <b>playing</b> in the 2006 Winter Olympics. He appeared in six games, scoring one goal and five points for the eighth place Americans.|$|E
5|$|Crawford's {{appearance}} in the 1969 television film Night Gallery (which served as pilot to the series that followed), marked one of Steven Spielberg's earliest directing jobs. She made a cameo appearance as herself in the first episode of the situation comedy The Tim Conway Show, which aired on January 30, 1970. She starred {{on the big screen}} one final <b>time,</b> <b>playing</b> Dr. Brockton in Herman Cohen's science fiction horror film Trog (1970), rounding out a career spanning 45 years and more than eighty motion pictures. Crawford made three more television appearances, as Stephanie White in a 1970 episode ("The Nightmare") of The Virginian and as Joan Fairchild (her final performance) in a 1972 episode ("Dear Joan: We're Going to Scare You to Death") of The Sixth Sense.|$|E

5|$|Fat Freddy's Drop {{returned}} to touring New Zealand, Australia and Europe {{to promote the}} new album in 2009. Three shows {{on the west coast}} of the United States, and a show in Canada, were also included in the tour. The only previous time the band had played in the United States was a single performance at the Detroit Electronic Music festival in 2004. Before 2009, the cost of touring in the US, difficulty obtaining visas, and the band's low profile in North America prevented them from including tour dates there. Band members say they now consider playing together as Fat Freddy's Drop their first musical priority, and spend less <b>time</b> <b>playing</b> with other bands.|$|E
5|$|In {{promotion}} of Black Country Communion 2, the band completed a short tour of Europe between June and July {{supported by the}} Michael Schenker Group. The group also performed in the US for the first <b>time,</b> <b>playing</b> a total of seven shows in six states between June 10 and 19. Live Over Europe, the band's first live video album, was released in October and screened in a select number of Vue Cinemas across the UK and Ireland in November. At {{the end of the}} year, the group won the Classic Rock award for Breakthrough Act of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Moon {{earned his}} seat in the 2009 World Series of Poker no-limit Texas hold'em Main Event by winning a $130 {{satellite}} tournament at the Wheeling Island Casino in Wheeling, West Virginia. He lost in two Wheeling Island tournaments before finishing in first place on his third attempt, winning a $10,000 main event seat and $6,000 for expenses. The event marked Moon’s first <b>time</b> <b>playing</b> in the WSOP, as well as visiting Las Vegas, Nevada and riding in a commercial plane. Due to the poor economy's impact on the logging business, Moon considered keeping the $10,000 instead of entering the tournament, but decided to play after visiting the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino and watching World Series games there.|$|E

A month into the campaign, he was assured by General Manager Doug MacLean {{that he would}} not be returned to the Giants as he had been the previous season. He was scratched several times under head coach Gerard Gallant, but after Gallant was replaced by Ken Hitchcock in late-November, he began receiving more playing <b>time.</b> <b>Playing</b> mostly on the fourth line in his rookie season, he averaged 10minutes of ice time per game. He went on to tally 19points (9goals and 10assists) over 78games in his first full NHL season.|$|E
