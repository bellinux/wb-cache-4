Calling it a [...] "humbug", the reviewer noted that the author's line of reasoning about this philosophical idea was difficult to follow. [...] "He chases from the wilderness of phrenology into that of transcendentalism, then into that of metaphysics generally; then through many weary pages into the open field of inductive philosophy, where he at last corners <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing,</b> and then most unmercifully pokes it {{to death with a}} long stick." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was said}} that those {{ancestors}} were on the Long Walk with their daughter, who was pregnant and about to give birth [...] the daughter got tired and weak and couldn't {{keep up with the}} others or go further because of her condition. So my ancestors asked the Army to hold up for a while and to let the woman give birth, but the soldiers wouldn't do it. They forced my people to move on, saying that they were getting behind the others. The soldier told the parents that they had to leave their daughters behind. [...] "Your daughter is not going to survive, anyway; sooner or later she is going to die," [...] they said in their own language. [...] "Go ahead," [...] the daughter said to her parents, [...] "things might come out all right with me," [...] But <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing</b> was mistaken, my grandparents used to say. Not long after they had moved on, they heard a gunshot from where they had been a short time ago.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll take {{a message}} to <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing,</b> with the {{greatest}} pleasure," [...] answered Sergeant Cuff, before I could put in a word edgewise.|$|E
60|$|THE NEWLY BORN. I {{think it}} would be nice to give <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>things</b> a little music.|$|R
60|$|But either <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>things</b> had no ghosts or {{they were}} too polite to bother the little child-larks.|$|R
60|$|ENID. [Rising.] Oh! that's not true! <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing's</b> heart---- What {{makes you}} look at me like that? I tried to help her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} sorry," [...] {{interposed}} Mrs. Alger authoritatively, [...] "if we had {{said anything to}} influence <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing</b> in what she has done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Horner {{burst into}} a laugh; {{but there was a}} tear in my Lady's eyes, for she knew what <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing</b> was a-thinking of.|$|E
60|$|When {{three o'clock}} came, and still {{we had not}} found the 3.10 train, we became quite anxious about <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing,</b> and made {{inquiries}} concerning it.|$|E
60|$|Annie realised, in her {{resentment of}} <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing's</b> uncouth sorrow, {{that she had}} spoken to her {{with the hope of}} getting, not giving, comfort.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you. All I intend is, that if {{it should}} be as I suppose, <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>things</b> should not miss coming to an {{understanding}} for want--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{can be no}} harm in your hearing it," [...] was Miss Fossett's excuse; [...] "it {{will give}} you an idea of the state of <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing's</b> mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's go {{back and}} talk to the girl," [...] {{suggested}} Patsy. [...] "Somehow, <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing</b> seems lonely, and her smile was more pathetic than cheerful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hallo! hold on!" [...] cried Rooney, as {{they went}} over a hummock with a crash that made Kannoa gasp, [...] "you'll kill <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing</b> if you--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, dear me, miss," [...] <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing</b> cried brokenly, [...] "how should {{your young}} mind feel what {{an old woman}} feels: just grovelling in the past?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, {{that was}} old Johnson," [...] he answered. [...] "Don't you be frightened of that; he lives here." [...] And {{then he told}} me <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing's</b> history.|$|R
6000|$|The {{luminous}} mist which <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>things</b> wist was [...] dawn arriving {{across the}} sky, When dawn is {{far behind the}} star the dust-lit town [...] has driven so high.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Truly,' thought Mrs Varden, 'this gentleman is a saint. But,' {{she added}} aloud, and not unnaturally, 'if you take Miss Emma's lover away, sir, what becomes of <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing's</b> heart then?' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{believe she}} is on this point rather out of her mind, and I do hope <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing</b> will not do {{anything}} wild, and get into mischief.|$|E
6000|$|To be sure, {{that would}} have killed <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing</b> outright. But a Kelmscott, you know, should respect his order, and shouldn't shrink for a moment from these trifling sacrifices! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{thought at}} first <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing</b> was dead, but she rallied after a bit, and {{it seemed as though}} she had braced herself up to hear the thing out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite a simple, Bohemian little affair," [...] {{proceeded}} Mrs. Peagrim. [...] "I {{thought it}} was only right to give <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>things</b> a little treat after they have all worked so hard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; all {{the birds}} in Mo are educated to talk," [...] said the Bumpy Man. Then he looked at Cap'n Bill uneasily and added: [...] "Won't you let <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>things</b> go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly--seem foolish-like; and that's {{very bad}} for <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>things</b> that be so, though I only guess as much, to be sure," [...] said Grandfer Cantle, still strenuously {{preserving}} a sensible bearing and mien.|$|R
6000|$|... 'At all events, {{there is}} no fear of his ill-using <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing,</b> if he loves her well enough to go {{down on his knees}} to his sworn foes for her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed, Val, {{the dark}} and damp would surely kill <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing,</b> in spite of your attentions. You must {{make up your mind}} to {{separation}} from your pets, excepting the kitten.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But no, m'sieur! It is outrageous. <b>The</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing</b> has but now sobbed {{herself to}} sleep, after many bitter hours. Can you not wait a brief hour, having waited five days?" ...|$|E
60|$|MEPHISTOPHELES: No, Lord! I {{find all}} there, as ever, bad at best. Even I am sorry for man's days of sorrow; I could myself almost {{give up the}} {{pleasure}} Of plaguing <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>things.</b>|$|R
60|$|Hannah {{never forgot}} to make them, {{no matter how}} busy or grumpy she might be, for the walk was long and bleak. <b>The</b> <b>poor</b> <b>things</b> got no other lunch and were seldom home before two.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{not sorry}} you spared her," [...] said Jackson; [...] "as {{for the two}} that are dead, they're no great loss--yet I've a kind o' regret too, for <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>things</b> served us well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't you see he's hurting <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing?</b> Make {{him leave}} off! Brute!" [...] she added to Henry (for whom one's heart bleeds), as he jabbed once again at his adversary.|$|E
60|$|The doubt was so ugly {{that it must}} be solved; {{and when}} she had got <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing</b> safe into her bedroom she alluded to it as gently as she could.|$|E
60|$|Of {{medicine}} or surgery <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing</b> knew nothing. She could but lick the wounds, and thus she kept them cleansed, that healing nature might the more quickly do her work.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; but I hope their {{brothers}} 'ull love <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>things,</b> and remember they came o' one father and mother; the lads 'ull never be <b>the</b> <b>poorer</b> for that," [...] said Mrs. Moss, flashing out with hurried timidity, like a half-smothered fire.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So {{you are so}} {{innocent}} as to think they don't know! Depend upon it, every house in Wrapworth rings with it; and won't it be more improving to have <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing's</b> grave to point the moral?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That is true,” {{admitted}} Beth, who had {{conceived the}} same idea; “but you mustn’t mind her, Mildred. <b>The</b> <b>poor</b> <b>thing’s</b> only half civilized and doesn’t understand our ways very well. What {{do you think}} of little Jane?” ...|$|R
