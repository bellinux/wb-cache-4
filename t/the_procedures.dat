5|$|<b>The</b> <b>procedures</b> {{relating}} to {{the election of the}} pope have undergone almost two millennia of development.

5|$|A more {{detailed}} procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxides, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure elution from cation exchange resins, and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted {{using one of}} <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> described above. Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium). Berkelium and cerium are then separated with another round of ion-exchange treatment.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} worked through <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> and checklists for entry on Friday, the {{managers}} {{on the ground}} closely examined the weather patterns around Florida, which were less than favorable. The crew was advised that there were low clouds and thunderstorms, both conditions that violated landing criteria, so managers waived the first opportunity. A second opportunity was also not taken, as the weather had not improved. Entry Flight Director Norm Knight called up Edwards Air Force Base shortly after the decision to delay to Saturday was made, which would give the crew {{a total of six}} Saturday landing opportunities, three at each location.|$|E

Paracetamol (aka acetaminophen) or other simple analgesics can be used to ease soreness, which is common for 2–3 days after <b>the</b> <b>procedure.</b> Any worsening pain, redness, fever, bleeding or swelling may suggest a complication.

After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E
5|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM), {{also known as}} female genital cutting and female circumcision, is the ritual cutting or removal of {{some or all of}} the external female genitalia. The practice is found in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, and within communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women living today in 30 countries—27 African countries, Indonesia, Iraqi Kurdistan and Yemen—have undergone <b>the</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the {{separation}} burn, the crew {{set to work}} performing the standard late inspection of the thermal protection system of the orbiter. Using the robotic arm, McArthur, Altman, and Johnson worked through <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> to inspect the wing leading-edge panels, reinforced carbon-carbon nose cap, and heat shield tiles. After evaluating the weather reports, managers on the ground slightly refined the schedule for landing, opting to bring the shuttle home one orbit early {{to try to avoid}} the possibility of showers that would prevent a landing on Friday. The new landing opportunity would bring the crew home at 10:01am EDT.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> {{has drawn}} {{criticism}} as its long-term effects are relatively unknown.

5|$|For {{the next}} few months, Cranmer and the king worked on {{establishing}} legal procedures on how the monarch's marriage would be judged by his most senior clergy. Several drafts of <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> have been preserved in letters written between the two. Once <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> were agreed, Cranmer opened his court on 10 May, inviting Henry and Catherine of Aragon to appear. Gardiner represented the king; Catherine did not appear or send a proxy. On 23 May Cranmer pronounced the judgement that Henry's marriage with Catherine was against the law of God. He even issued a threat of excommunication if Henry did not stay away from Catherine. Henry was now free to marry and, on 28 May, Cranmer validated Henry and Anne's marriage. On 1 June, Cranmer personally crowned and anointed Anne queen and delivered to her the sceptre and rod. Pope Clement VII was furious at this defiance, {{but he could not}} take decisive action as he was pressured by other monarchs to avoid an irreparable breach with England. However, on 9 July he provisionally excommunicated Henry and his advisers (which included Cranmer) unless he repudiated Anne by the end of September. Henry kept Anne as his wife and, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Elizabeth. Cranmer baptised her immediately afterwards and acted as one of her godparents.|$|E

In 1997, {{at a meeting of}} former draft resistance activists at Arlington Street Church in Boston, Putnam described his involvement with the PLP as a mistake. He said that he had been impressed at first with the PLP's commitment to alliance-building and its willingness to attempt to organize from within the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Bevin's {{administration}} sent a {{cease and desist}} {{letter to}} Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky ordering it to stop performing abortions at its clinic in Louisville {{because it did not}} have the required license. The clinic claimed it had been given permission to perform <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> by Beshear's inspector general just prior to Bevin taking office, but nonetheless halted <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> on January 28. Bevin filed suit against Planned Parenthood in February, claiming it had illegally performed 23 abortions without a license; the suit said Planned Parenthood's licensure application was deficient because it did not include agreements with a hospital and ambulance service to transport and care for patients in case of complications, as required by state law, and that Beshear's inspector general was wrong in instructing the organization to begin performing abortions before the license was approved. Planned Parenthood countered that, before the license could be finalized, the abortion facility would have to be subjected to an unannounced inspection, requiring that abortions were already being performed there. In March, the University of Louisville Hospital announced that it had backed out of a transfer agreement with Planned Parenthood, saying it had been pressured to do so and felt that its state funding was in jeopardy by continuing in the agreement. A spokesman for Bevin denied that the pressure had come from anyone in the administration.|$|E
