So, then, observe, {{this feeling}} {{which you are}} {{accustomed}} to despise--this secret and poetical enthusiasm in all your hearts, which, as practical men, you try to restrain--is indeed one of the holiest parts of your being. It is the instinctive delight in, and admiration for, sublimity, beauty, and virtue, unusually manifested. And so {{far from being a}} dangerous guide, it is the truest part of your being. It is even truer than your consciences. A man's conscience may be utterly perverted and led astray; but so long as the feelings of romance endure within us, they are unerring,--they are as true to what is right and lovely as the needle to the north; and all <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to add to the enthusiastic sentiment, the majestic judgment--to mingle prudence and foresight with imagination and admiration, and you have the perfect human soul. But the great evil of these days is that we try to destroy the romantic feeling, instead of bridling and directing it. Mark what Young says of the men of the world:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{should that}} be so very difficult?" [...] he demanded. [...] "If {{you look at it}} rightly, Christmas is always full of inspiration; and songs as well as sermons will flow from it till time shall be no more. The trouble with us is that we think it is for the {{pleasure}} of opulent and elderly people, for whom there can be no pleasures, but only habits. They are used to having everything, and as joy dwells in novelty it has ceased to be for them in Christmas gifts and giving and all manner of Christmas conventions. But for the young to whom these things are new, and for the poor to whom they are rare, Christmas and Christmasing are sources of perennial happiness. All <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to guard yourself from growing rich and from growing old, and then the delight of Christmas is yours forever. It is not difficult; it is very simple; for even if years and riches come upon you in a literal way, you can by a little trying keep yourself young and poor in spirit. Then you can always rejoice with the innocent and riot with the destitute.|$|E
