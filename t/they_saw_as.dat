5|$|Other critics, such as Bart Beaty, {{objected to}} what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the work's fatalism.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the radically anti-business views of the Aberhart government and the Social Credit Board, Alberta's mainstream opposition parties—chiefly the Liberals and the Conservatives—began to cooperate {{under the auspices of}} the newly formed People's League.|$|E
5|$|All {{surviving}} medieval {{accounts of}} the movement are by supporters of reform, who strongly condemned what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> the corruption and religious inadequacy of the secular clergy, but historians {{in the late twentieth}} and early twenty-first centuries have increasingly seen these accounts as unfairly biased against the secular clergy.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{a similar}} {{language}} <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> themselves <b>as</b> {{distinct from the}} Barkinji, who they called the spitting people.|$|R
50|$|The MPAA and RIAA {{supported}} the proposal, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> finally bringing in Canada to WIPO standards, having lobbied/pressured hard for stricter copyright rules.|$|R
50|$|In late 2011, the school's partner {{institutions}} {{announced they}} would discontinue {{working with the}} school <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> being unable to meet its obligations.|$|R
5|$|During the Civil War, the Union and Russia were allies {{against what}} <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> their {{potential}} enemy, Britain. The Russian blue-water navy {{was stationed in}} San Francisco and from 1863 in New York—with sealed orders to attack British naval targets in case war broke out between the United States and Britain. This was threatened if Britain gave diplomatic recognition to the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|In New River, Cooley {{sustained}} {{himself as}} a salvager and farmer, cultivating and milling arrowroot. His fortune and influence grew: {{he became the first}} lawman and judge in the settlement, besides being a land appraiser. Local Indians held him responsible for what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> a misjudgment involving the murder of one of their chiefs, and attacked the settlement in revenge on January 4, 1836.|$|E
5|$|McCarthyism was {{supported}} by a variety of groups, including the American Legion and various other anti-communist organizations. One core element of support was a variety of militantly anti-communist women's groups such as the American Public Relations Forum and the Minute Women of the U.S.A.. These organized tens of thousands of housewives into study groups, letter-writing networks, and patriotic clubs that coordinated efforts to identify and eradicate what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> subversion.|$|E
60|$|The stained {{walls of}} the dingy {{restaurant}} were fading into space before the young men's eyes. <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> themselves <b>as</b> gods walking {{in the garden of}} their hearts' desires.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Ehman Jr., {{executive}} director of the America II syndicate, said the America II team entered US 42 in the competition because <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> the slowest of its new boats.|$|R
50|$|Luteyn refused, {{together}} with about 60 other officers, cadets and one {{rating of the}} Dutch navy (stoker Willem de Lange). The officers refusing did so for various reasons. Some did not give their word because <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> conflicting with their officer's oath. The majority of officers who didn't give their word of honour were officers of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, arguing that according to their regulations it was forbidden to give their word of honour and because the Dutch East Indies were still free at that time, <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> their duty {{to remain in the}} fight.|$|R
5|$|Adams also {{rebuilt the}} Navy, adding six fast, {{powerful}} frigates, {{most notably the}} USS Constitution. To pay for the military buildup, Congress imposed new taxes on property: the Direct Tax of 1798. It was the first (and last) such federal tax. Taxpayers were angered, especially in southeast Pennsylvania, where the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out among rural German-speaking farmers who protested what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> {{a threat to their}} republican liberties and to their churches.|$|E
5|$|Although {{theoretically}} a collegial body operating through consensus building, Gaddafi {{dominated the}} RCC, {{although some of}} the others attempted to constrain what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> his excesses. Gaddafi remained the government's public face, with the identities of the other RCC members only being publicly revealed on 10 January 1970. All young men from (typically rural) working and middle-class backgrounds, none had university degrees; in this way they were distinct from the wealthy, highly educated conservatives who previously governed the country.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role in what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to {{positions of power}} at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of}} the Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E
5000|$|Politically, <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the Church <b>as</b> {{essential}} in maintaining a conservative social {{order and the}} Monarchy.|$|R
50|$|Marx and Engels {{declared}} that 'the working men have no country'. <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> nationalism <b>as</b> a 'false consciousness', which prevented {{the working class}} from rising up and ending their oppression by the capitalist class.|$|R
60|$|I {{found the}} housemaid and the cook talking {{together}} in whispers with serious faces. They started when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> me <b>as</b> if I {{had been a}} grown-up master who had caught them neglecting their work.|$|R
5|$|Gingrich {{and others}} in the House, {{including}} the newly minted Gang of Seven, railed against what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> ethical lapses during the nearly 40 years of Democratic control for almost 40 years. The House banking scandal and Congressional Post Office scandal were emblems of the exposed corruption. Gingrich himself was among members of the House who had written NSF checks on the House bank. He had overdrafts on twenty-two checks, including a $9,463 check to the Internal Revenue Service in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Gotcha was {{designed}} by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, and a prototype was constructed by Cyan Engineering, Atari's semi-independent research and development subsidiary. Development began in July 1973 as part of Atari's strategy to develop multiple types of games to separate themselves from their competitors, who <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> focused primarily on creating Pong clones. The cabinet {{was designed}} by George Faraco, initially with the joysticks encased in pink domes meant to represent breasts. Although this design inspired the advertising flyer on which it appears behind a man chasing {{a woman in a}} nightdress, it was changed to use regular joysticks soon after release.|$|E
5|$|Heroes of Mana was {{produced}} by series creator Koichi Ishii and directed by Takeo Oin. The story was written by Masato Kato, and the music was composed by Yoko Shimomura. The game was not a commercial success, selling around 180,000 copies worldwide {{by the end of}} 2007, less than contemporary Mana games. While critics generally praised the graphics, they were dismissive of the plot, mixed on the actual gameplay and sharply negative on what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> poor artificial intelligence and pathfinding inhibiting actual play.|$|E
5000|$|Carpenter {{faced the}} {{difficult}} task to replace All-American left tackle Andre Smith. While analysts {{did not expect}} him to dominate as a run blocker like Smith, <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>as</b> [...] "a rock in pass protection".|$|R
25|$|Given his {{departure}} from radicalism, and {{his attempts to}} have former fellow travellers prosecuted, it is unsurprising that less successful contemporaries who kept the faith attacked Southey. <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> him <b>as</b> selling out for money and respectability.|$|R
25|$|The Irish Catholics in America were recent immigrants; {{most were}} poor {{and very few}} owned slaves. They had to compete with free blacks for unskilled labor jobs. <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> abolitionism <b>as</b> the militant wing of evangelical anti-Catholic Protestantism.|$|R
5|$|On 1 November 2009 about 250 {{protesters in}} Brisbane who {{expressed}} anger at Wotton's sentencing. The same week, similar rallies {{took place in}} major Australian cities and in Wellington, New Zealand. MUA workers in Sydney observed one minute's silence in solidarity. Speakers at a Brisbane rally argued that Wotton should {{have been given a}} bravery award for what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> standing up to the racist oppression of Palm Islanders. Benefit concerts were also held in support of him.|$|E
5|$|Pope John Paul II celebrated mass {{over the}} train tracks leading to the camp on 7 June 1979. In the decades {{following}} his visit, controversies erupted over a group of Carmelite nuns founding a convent on the site and erecting a large cross originally used in the pope's mass. Protesters objected to what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> Christianization of the site, while others argued that the cross's presence effectively recognized the camp's Catholic victims.|$|E
5|$|The Sixth World Congress in 1961 {{marked a}} {{lessening}} {{of the political}} divisions between the majority of supporters of the International Secretariat and {{the leadership of the}} SWP in the United States. In particular, the congress stressed support for the Cuban revolution and a growing emphasis on building parties in the imperialist countries. The sixth congress also criticised the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, its Sri Lankan section, for seeming to support the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> bourgeois nationalists; the U.S. SWP made similar criticisms.|$|E
2500|$|Rav Mesharsheya {{said that}} [...] {{proved that the}} spies were liars, for though they might well have known that <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> {{themselves}} <b>as</b> grasshoppers, <b>they</b> {{had no way of}} knowing how the inhabitants of the land saw them.|$|R

5|$|The {{film was}} panned by {{mainstream}} critics, particularly for what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> its weak script and gratuitous violence. However, many horror genre critics were more positive, viewing {{the film as}} unpretentiously entertaining. The film topped the domestic box office on its opening weekend and was a major hit in Brazil, Russia, Germany, and Mexico. Its worldwide theatrical run gross exceeded $226 million for the production cost of $50 million. Due to the commercial success of the film, which was planned as {{the first part of}} a series, its sequel is currently in development.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began on}} 21 January 1997, under the {{supervision}} of a three-judge panel led by Mikaela Warsito. After both sides were unable to come to an amicable settlement, a several-month-long trial began, in which Udin's family, Bernas reporters, and the police testified. On 7 April 1997, Wuryanto was convicted of destroying evidence for taking the blood, which Marisyem's lawyers speculated was used to frame Sumaji. Only {{a small percentage of the}} damages were awarded, after the court ruled that testimony from Udin's family– whom <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> having a conflict of interest in the outcome of the case– was ineligible.|$|E
5|$|The label {{was founded}} in 1996 in Durham, North Carolina by {{musician}} Kaia Wilson and artist/UNC photography professor Tammy Rae Carland, aiming to redress what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>as</b> a lack of feminist record labels at the time. As well as a range of recording artists, the label was also heavily involved in other events that promoted feminist thinking and music, such as the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival – which led to some controversy in 1999 – and various art showcases. Mr. Lady closed down in June 2004.|$|E
25|$|Many Sahaba, {{the most}} {{prominent}} being Abdullah ibn Zubayr, refused to give their oath of allegiance to Yazid, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> a usurpation of power and not the proper way of choosing a caliph by the Shura.|$|R
5000|$|Greer's {{attorney}} said [...] "The governor knew about Victory Strategies {{from the very}} beginning," [...] Chase said. [...] "They all worked on it together… <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> it <b>as</b> {{a way to save}} money and the charges should be dismissed." ...|$|R
50|$|The Spanish provincial {{authorities}} {{collaborated with the}} Jews, since <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> them <b>as</b> an outlet for export and the suppliers of much-needed European goods, since the over-extended Spanish fleet could not {{meet the demands of}} all its American colonies.|$|R
