40|$|Understanding {{the physics}} of {{three-phase}} (gas, oil and water) displacements in porous rocks is crucial for predicting petroleum recovery and the migration of non-aqueous phase liquids contaminated in soils. Topological properties of porous rocks and interactions of fluids within these rocks control how three fluid phases flow together in pore space. The effort made in the 1990 s using 2 D glass micro models of simplistic porous system helped significantly understand the physics and mechanisms of three-phase fluid interactions in porous media. However, no study has been reported so far to {{examine the effect of}} the three-dimensional topological properties of a porous rock on characteristics of three-phase fluids. 	This thesis presents a study that combines the 3 D imaging and 3 D computational analysis to characterise qualitatively and quantitatively the three-phase fluids (oil, water and gas) at different spreading conditions in a porous rock. It attempts to answer whether or not the intermediate oil phase in a gas-oil-water system is spatially connected within an actual porous rock through oil films. An innovative experimental approach was used to visualise 3 D distributions of three-phase (gas, oil and water) using a high resolution micro-CT. A methodology used to align and subtract two sets of tomograms of the same rock being dry and partially saturated is presented. This methodology allows extracting and delineating 3 D information of oil, water and gas in a porous rock which provides a qualitative description of the configurations and distributions of three phases regardless of the uncertainty associated to pores topology. A sophisticated segmentation algorithm was used to perform a quantitative analysis of the gas-oil-water distributions obtained from the micro-CT images. The spatial connectivity of each of the phases {{at the end of the}} <b>tertiary</b> <b>gas</b> flooding was analysed and discussed using quantitative measures obtained from the Euler characteristics method. This study provides a confirmation of the presence and continuity of oil spreading films for positive spreading systems in real porous media and the absence of spreading films for negative spreading systems...|$|E

These mechanisms are oil displacement by solvent through the generation of miscibility, oil swelling, and reduction in oil viscocity.

Least-cost planning is a life-cycle costing approach for alternative analysis and decision-making, determining the preferred option that provides the optimal mix of financial, social and environmental outcomes for stakeholders throughout the project lifespan. A more sustainable approach is to incorporate the low carbon context into this economic analysis. Case studies, Tianjin Eco-city and Ningbo-Cixi Wetland Centre, granted by GEF, are presented and reviewed on how to foster key coastal areas of China into eco-cities by means of carbon footprint and costing.

40|$|ABSTRACT Globular {{proteins}} {{are important}} both as therapeutic agents and excipients. However, their fragile native conformations can be denatured during pharmaceutical processing, {{which leads to}} modification of the surface energy of their powders and hence their performance. Lyophilized powders of hen egg-white lysozyme and β-galactosidase from Aspergillus oryzae were used as models to {{study the effects of}} mechanical denaturation on the surface energies of basic and acidic protein powders, respectively. Their mechanical denaturation upon milling was confirmed by the absence of their thermal unfolding transition phases and by the changes in their secondary and <b>tertiary</b> structures. Inverse <b>gas</b> chromatography detected differences between both unprocessed protein powders and the changes induced by their mechanical denaturation. The surfaces of the acidic and basic protein powders were relatively basic, however the surface acidity of β-galactosidase was higher than that of lysozyme. Also, the surface of β-galactosidase powder had a higher dispersive energy compared to lysozyme. The mechanical denaturation decreased the dispersive energy and the basicity of the surfaces of both protein powders. The amino acid composition and molecular conformation of the proteins explained the surface energy data measured by inverse gas chromatography. The biological activity of mechanically denatured protein powders can either be reversible (lysozyme) or irreversible (β-galactosidase) upon hydration. Our surface data can be exploited to understand and predict the performance of protein powders within pharmaceutical dosage forms...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report {{describing}} {{the evolution of the}} project ''Development and Optimization of Gas-Assisted Gravity Drainage (GAGD) Process for Improved Light Oil Recovery'' from its conceptual stage in 2002 to the field implementation of the developed technology in 2006. This comprehensive report includes all the experimental research, models developments, analyses of results, salient conclusions and the technology transfer efforts. As planned in the original proposal, the project has been conducted in three separate and concurrent tasks: Task 1 involved a physical model study of the new GAGD process, Task 2 was aimed at further developing the vanishing interfacial tension (VIT) technique for gas-oil miscibility determination, and Task 3 was directed at determining multiphase gas-oil drainage and displacement characteristics in reservoir rocks at realistic pressures and temperatures. The project started with the task of recruiting well-qualified graduate research assistants. After collecting and reviewing the literature on different aspects of the project such gas injection EOR, gravity drainage, miscibility characterization, and gas-oil displacement characteristics in porous media, research plans were developed for the experimental work to be conducted under each of the three tasks. Based on the literature review and dimensional analysis, preliminary criteria were developed for the design of the partially-scaled physical model. Additionally, the need for a separate transparent model for visual observation and verification of the displacement and drainage behavior under gas-assisted gravity drainage was identified. Various materials and methods (ceramic porous material, Stucco, Portland cement, sintered glass beads) were attempted in order to fabricate a satisfactory visual model. In addition to proving the effectiveness of the GAGD process (through measured oil recoveries in the range of 65 to 87 % IOIP), the visual models demonstrated three possible multiphase mechanisms at work, namely, Darcy-type displacement until gas breakthrough, gravity drainage after breakthrough and film-drainage in gas-invaded zones throughout the duration of the process. The partially-scaled physical model was used in a series of experiments to study the effects of wettability, gas-oil miscibility, secondary versus <b>tertiary</b> mode <b>gas</b> injection, and the presence of fractures on GAGD oil recovery. In addition to yielding recoveries of up to 80 % IOIP, even in the immiscible gas injection mode, the partially-scaled physical model confirmed the positive influence of fractures and oil-wet characteristics in enhancing oil recoveries over those measured in the homogeneous (unfractured) water-wet models. An interesting observation was that a single logarithmic relationship between the oil recovery and the gravity number was obeyed by the physical model, the high-pressure corefloods and the field data...|$|R
