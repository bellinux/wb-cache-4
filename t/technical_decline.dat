40|$|During the Second World War science came {{to play a}} {{large role}} in the British government's plans for postwar {{reconstruction}} of industry. The planners sought to improve industry's labour productivity and capacity for RandD. They drew on the consensus which had developed among scientists, industrialists and politicians favouring a great increase in state aid to universities and industrial RandD and increased government direction of research. The postwar Labour government, impressed with scientists' contributions to the war effort and faced with grave economic difficulties, was eager to enlist science in raising industrial output. By 1951, however, it had implemented few new programmes in this area. More money was being spent on the pre-existing Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and industry's co-operative Research Associations; the universities had doubled their output; the National Research and Development Corporation had begun in 1949; some publicity campaigns had raised public awareness of productivity's significance; and the economy, in the postwar boom, was performing much better than prewar. But overall the Attlee government did much less to raise industry's scientific level than it had planned. Almost every new programme was inadequately funded and staffed, and the few which survived had no realistic chance of reaching into individual factories to achieve the scientific renaissance which was necessary to return Britain to the front rank, by international standards, of innovation and industrial performance. The thesis examines that portion of civil science policy which aimed to improve industrial RandD and productivity, from the planning stage during the Coalition through implementation by the Attlee government. After an introductory chapter, Chapter 2 covers the work of wartime ministerial and official reconstruction committees; party differences and business opposition meant that reforms favouring a greater government role in RandD and industry generally were shelved until postwar. Chapter 3 examines the Attlee government's efforts to improve industrial RandD, particularly the formation of the Advisory Council on Scientific Policy, a failed attempt to create a British MIT, and several schemes, mostly unavailing, to vitalise DSIR, the RAs and private RandD. Chapter 4 examines postwar productivity policy, particularly the work of the Board of Trade, the scientifically-orientated Committee on Industrial Productivity, various government publicity campaigns, and the Anglo-American Council on Productivity. Chapter 5 briefly sketches post- 1951 developments and finds that there has been little basic change in the policies suggested for arresting British industry's <b>technical</b> <b>decline</b> relative to its competitors, despite recurrent disappointment with the results of those policies. </p...|$|E

40|$|Vegetable {{production}} {{could be}} increased through horizontal expansion, development {{of modern technology}} and vertical expansion such as efficient use of readily available resources. Third approach of using available resources more efficiently is more viable since, {{there is no need}} to make extra efforts to bring new area under vegetable cultivation and or changing cropping pattern. Similarly, new investment is not needed to develop modern technology. This implies that vegetable production could be increased through boosting up productivity. This will not only increase availability of vegetables in the country but it will also pick up income of vegetable growing farmers. Keeping in view the importance of vegetables in terms of income and essential nutrients, the present study was designed to determine technical efficiency and profitability of growing vegetables in Punjab. Four vegetables namely potato, carrot, radish and bitter gourd were chosen. Stochastic frontier production function was employed to ascertain level of technical efficiency and its determinants. Stochastic frontier production function and ordinary least square (OLS) estimates were used to determine yield level of vegetable production. On the basis of these estimates, profitability of vegetables was estimated. Results of the study showed that OLS was not appropriate method for the given data-sets of vegetables. Moreover, translog production function was preferable over Cobb-Douglas production function on the basis of log likelihood ratio test. Derived production elasticity estimates indicated that seed, plant protection measures, irrigation, labour used to perform various farming activities and use of NPK nutrients were significantly contributing in vegetable yields with few exceptions. It was also found out that irrigation in radish and NPK nutrients in potato production were negatively influencing the yield of respective vegetables. The reasons lie in the fact that the radish growing farmers were using sewage water to irrigate radish crop during shortage of canal water and the use of sewage water badly distressed radish yield, whereas in case of potato production, farmers were using NPK nutrients above the recommended level. Considering determinants of technical efficiency, it was found out that with an increase in age of the vegetable growers, level of <b>technical</b> efficiency <b>declined</b> except in potato production where it was positively related to respondents' age. Education was positively related to technical efficiency implying that the highly educated vegetable growers were using available resources more efficiently. Family size was negatively related to level of technical efficiency in cultivation of all vegetables except bitter gourd. Ownership status had a mixture of effect on the level of technical efficiency. One of the important findings of the study was impact of farm area on technical efficiency. This variable indicated that with increased farm area, <b>technical</b> efficiency <b>declined</b> due to the fact that vegetable growers were able to apply latest technology on the farms because of availability of financial resources. Access to extension services were found <b>declining</b> level of <b>technical</b> inefficiency in vegetable cultivation. Environmental detrimental variables namely fertilizer and plant protection measures were positively related to level of technical efficiency indirectly indicating that vegetable yield had increased at the expense of environmental degradation. Therefore, research is required to determine optimum level of these inputs in vegetable production and other crops. Mean level of technical efficiency was 82 percent in radish, 72 percent in carrot, 70 percent in potato and 66 percent in bitter gourd indicating that there existed potential to increase vegetable production by using existing resources more efficiently. The most profitable vegetable was found bitter gourd followed by carrot, potato and radish. The lowest cost per kg was estimated in carrot cultivation whereas the highest one was found out in bitter gourd production. Coefficient of variation (CV) was determined for net income per acre. Results showed that the minimum value of CV was found out in carrot production and the maximum was recorded in potato production showing that potato production is more risky compared to other vegetables...|$|R

Examination of the data adopts two stages using a stochastic frontier approach. The first stage involves the specification and estimation of the stochastic frontier production function and the prediction of technical efficiency effects. The second stage involves the specification of a regression model for the predicted technical efficiency effects. The sources of TFP growth have been decomposed into four components; i. e. technical progress, changes in technical efficiency, scale effects, and change in allocative efficiency. The empirical results show that productivity has been largely due to changes in technical progress, technical efficiency and resource allocation effect. The changes in technical progress and resource allocation have improved in the post-reform period, i. e. 1984 - 98, while <b>technical</b> efficiency has <b>declined</b> in the post-reform period.

Among these environmental factors, NRCMS have in average a negative effect on the evolution of THs efficiency, although efficiency have improved for some of them. Our results suggest also that, in the context of China, the efficiency of township hospitals is influenced by unobservable factors. From our findings, we suggest five main orientations to improve THs efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. {{natural gas}} {{industry}} has undergone substantial change since {{the enactment of}} the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Although the major focus of the NGPA was to initiate partial and gradual price deregulation of natural gas at the well-head, the interstate transmission industry was profoundly affected by changes in the relative prices of competing fuels and contractual relationships among producers, transporters, distributors, and end-users. This paper assesses the impact of the NGPA on the technical efficiency and productivity of fourteen interstate natural gas transmission firms for the period 1978 - 1985. We focus on the distortionary effects that resulted in the industry during a period in which changes in regulatory policy could neither anticipate changing market conditions nor rapidly adjust to those changes. Two alternative estimating methodologies, stochastic frontier production analysis and data envelopment analysis, are used to measure the firm-specific and temporal distortionary effects. Concordant findings from these alternative methodologies suggest a pervasive pattern of <b>declining</b> <b>technical</b> efficiency in the industry during the period in which this major regulatory intervention was introduced and implemented. The representative firms experience an average annual decline in efficiency of. 55 percent over the sample period. In addition, it appears that the industry suffered a decline in productivity during the sample period, averaging - 1. 18 percent annually.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} the macroeconomic performance of 25 transition economies using a comparable data set for 1991 - 2000. Centrally planned economies were criticized for wide-spread economic inefficiency and low {{total factor productivity}} growth. In order to see whether transition to market based economy increased economic efficiency, technical progress, and total factor productivity, we estimate efficiency measures for East European, Baltic, and the other Former Soviet Union Countries using Stochastic Frontier Analysis and Data Envelopment Analysis. The average annual efficiency level for 25 transition economies is 0. 559 over the period 1991 - 2000. The average annual growth in technical efficiency is 2. 8 percent over the same period. This efficiency change (or catch-up) in transition economies {{suggests that there is}} a mixture of increasing and decreasing efficiency levels for the whole period. The average annual technical change in transition economies is- 19 percent over the period examined. That is, there is no technological progress, but over the whole period there has been technological decline. As a result, the average annual total factor productivity change for each of 25 transition country has declined due to huge negative technical change and a slight positive efficiency change. The sum of technical and technical changes is 16. 2 percent. That is, the average annual total factor productivity has declined by 16. 2 percent over the period 1991 - 2000. These results suggest that, on average, technical efficiency change or catch-up is overcompensated by the <b>declining</b> <b>technical</b> change...|$|R
