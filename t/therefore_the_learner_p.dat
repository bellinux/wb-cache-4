This paper attempts to propose a performance-based learning (PeBL) approach to create stage contexts in game-based learning environments.

By giving the students more responsibility for learning, language programs encouraged <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> to become more autonomous, to diagnose their own learning strengths and weaknesses, and to self-direct language learning process (Cohen & Weaver, 1998). Moreover, strategy training, if designed carefully and sensitively with the learners’ needs in mind, can become a key element in creative and self-directed language learning (Oxford et al., 1990; Ghahari & Basanjideh, 2015, 2017). <b>Therefore,</b> <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> can benefit from coaching in learning strategies and need to become aware of the learning strategies through strategy instruction.|$|R
30|$|Providing the {{components}} of the concept map is a kind of “closed-end” approach which is realizing the automatic diagnosis of the concept map built by a learner (Taricani & Clariana, 2006). <b>The</b> <b>learner</b> maps of <b>the</b> Kit-Build concept map are composed of the same components with the goal map.

From this viewpoint, it seems logical to argue how learners behave before, during, and after assessment depends on how they conceive of it (Segers, Dochy, & Cascallar, 2006).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} different levels of progress in asynchronous collaborative learning activities. The context for this research is organizations of distributed and mobile practitioners.

To facilitate collaborative activity the progress of the participants has to be synchronized in some way. The main problem addressed in this paper is the difficulty for participants to keep a common progress, to enable discussions, in asynchronous collaborative learning. To address this problem three methods for synchronization (synchronization points) are suggested: locked scenes, written instruction and collaborative production. The three methods were implemented and evaluated in an organization using a Net-scenario, the Net-scenario as a system and a methodology based on role-playing to initiate collaborative learning. This system was suitable to use in the evaluation since it can be used asynchronously as well as synchronously, supports distributed participants and is dependent on collaborative discussion concerning the content presented...|$|R

These L2 learners will replicate influences because their input of the L2 is not as pure as input from a monolingual; meaning, what appears as CLI in the individual isn't really CLI of their L1 on their L2, but the effects of acquiring input that has already been modified.

50|$|In {{international}} discussions, {{the concept}} of informal learning, already used by John Dewey {{at an early stage}} and later on by Malcolm Knowles, experienced a renaissance, especially in the context of development policy.

Marsick and Watkins take up this approach and go one step further in their definition. They, too, begin with the organizational form of learning and call those learning processes informal which are non-formal or not formally organized and are not financed by institutions (Watkins/Marsick, p. 12 et sec.). An example for a wider approach is Livingstone's definition which is oriented towards autodidactic and self-directed learning and places special emphasis on the self-definition of the learning process by <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> (Livingstone 1999, <b>p.</b> 68 et seq.).|$|R

40|$|Background An {{understanding}} {{of differences in}} expert and novice neural behavior can inform surgical skills training. Outside the surgical domain, electroencephalographic (EEG) coherence analyses have shown that during motor performance, experts display less coactivation between the verbal-analytic and motor planning regions than their less skilled counterparts. Reduced involvement of verbal-analytic processes suggests greater neural efficiency. The authors tested the utility of an implicit motor learning intervention specifically devised to promote neural efficiency by reducing verbal-analytic involvement in laparoscopic performance. Methods In this study, 18 novices practiced a movement pattern on a laparoscopic trainer with either conscious awareness of the movement pattern (explicit motor learning) or suppressed awareness of the movement pattern (implicit motor learning). In a retention test, movement accuracy was compared between the conditions, and coactivation (EEG coherence) was assessed between the motor planning (Fz) region and both the verbal-analytic (T 3) and the visuospatial (T 4) cortical regions (T 3 -Fz and T 4 -Fz, respectively). Results Movement accuracy in the conditions was not different in a retention test (P = 0. 231). Findings showed that the EEG coherence scores for the T 3 -Fz regions were lower for <b>the</b> implicit <b>learners</b> than for <b>the</b> explicit <b>learners</b> (<b>P</b> = 0. 027), but no differences were apparent for the T 4 -Fz regions (P = 0. 882). Conclusions Implicit motor learning reduced EEG coactivation between verbal-analytic and motor planning regions, suggesting that verbal-analytic processes were less involved in laparoscopic performance. The findings imply that training techniques that discourage nonessential coactivation during motor performance may provide surgeons with more neural resources with which to manage other aspects of surgery. © 2011 The Author(s). published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Nowadays, early foreign {{language}} learning in the Netherlands is booming and generally preferred over language learning starting at a later stage due to its presumed positive effects on pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar acquisition (Groot & Deelder, 2014). In (early) second language acquisition classrooms, native speaker teachers are often preferred over non-native speaker teachers due the model of language they can present; native speakers have reached the so-called target L 2 learners try to obtain (Cook, 2008, p. 185). Furthermore, in the Netherlands, it is generally assumed that learners who are taught by a native speaker will become more proficient in the target language than learners who are taught by a non-native speaker, {{especially in terms of}} pronunciation (SLO, 2011). However, hardly any research has focused on whether this assumption is true. This research attempts to fill this gap by examining whether early English language learners taught by a native speaker attain a more native-like pronunciation than learners taught by a non-native speaker. Pupils of two Dutch primary schools were tested on their English pronunciation (segmentals), with one group following an early learning programme in which they were (partly) taught by a native speaker teacher, and another group following such a programme during which they were taught by a non-native speaker. Results show that learners taught by a non-native speaker produce more native-like consonants than speakers taught by a native speaker. In addition, learners taught by a non-native speaker produce fewer Dutch-like vowels than learners taught by a native speaker. However, it cannot be concluded with certainty that, <b>therefore,</b> <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> taught by a non-native speaker also produced more native-like vowels. Yet, {{based on the results of}} this research, it can be concluded that, in terms of pronunciation, learners taught by a native speaker teacher are not more native-like than learners taught by a non-native speaker. It is arguable that being taught by a native speaker teacher does not lead to better pronunciation results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focuses on}} the problem of {{language}} transfer in foreign language learning. The transfer often leads to a communicative gap, which is caused by the difference between a learner’s mother language (ML) and the target language (TL). This paper first analyzes the semantic relations between the ML and the TL. Then it proposes a CGM (Communicative Gap Model) because of the meaning difference between both languages. We have developed a computer assisted languagelearning system called Neclle (Networkbased Communicative LanguageLearning Environment) in order to support foreign language learning through communication using a text based chat tool. Neclle has a software agent called Ankle (Agent for Kanji Learning), which observes the conversation between a learner and a native speaker, looks up a communicative gap in <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> utterance automatically according to CGM, the student model and the word dictionary of both languages, intervenes into the conversation, and gives an instruction for bridging the gap. Then, <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> can not only be aware of the gap but also acquire its cultural background from the native speaker. In our case study, Chinese students used Neclle for Japanese language learning.

40|$|D. Phil. Traditionally {{leadership}} {{was seen as}} synonymous with the executive authority of an organisation and in the school environment {{with that of the}} headmaster. However, a paradigm shift occurred and leadership is now viewed as attitudes, competencies and skills at three levels, namely the personal, interpersonal and professional levels, implying that every person is a leader {{in his or her own}} right. The idea of a leader as a value-driven, principle-centered and character-based person gathered momentum. The afore-mentioned qualities call for a special kind of self-knowledge that can partly be obtained from feedback to leaders on how stakeholders in the organisation perceive them and/or how their behaviour impacts on the organisation. Although school leadership gained momentum only in the past two decades, it has been realised that professionalism and the quality of leadership impact on the quality of teaching. It therefore seems important in the evaluation and improvement of teacher leadership to gain insight into how stakeholders, especially those (learners) who can speak authoritatively on their firsthand experiences of what is happening in class, perceive teacher leadership. The purpose of this study was to explore and describe learners' everyday experiences and interpretations of their teacher leadership in order to make recommendations to the stakeholders concerned. I embarked on an explorative-descriptive inquiry. To ensure high-quality research, I adhered to all the necessary criteria for reliable, valid and ethical research. In order to capitalise on both qualitative and quantitative research methods, and to compensate for the shortcomings of both, as well as to enrich the credibility of the study, I opted for a mixed-methods approach. In this study of an Afrikaans governmental high school in Gauteng, I made use of a symbolic interactionistic methodology to understand how learners perceive, understand and interpret their teacher leadership. Complying with ethical and professional considerations regarding research with children (namely access, protection against harm, informed consent, privacy and confidentiality) the study crystallised in two phases. In the first qualitative phase I made use of purposeful snowball sampling methods, and gained rich descriptions from learners and their parents regarding the learners' experiences of and perceptions about their teacher leadership. I used analytical methods based on the Chicago School of Symbolic /nteractionism to generate codes, which was categorised according to the leadership paradigm of personal, interpersonal and professional leadership. In a second phase, <b>the</b> universum of <b>learners</b> and teachers were included in a social survey. Two questionnaires were designed for <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> and teachers respectively. <b>The</b> <b>learner</b> questionnaire contained odd questions on demographic details, as well as hypotheses which were drawn from the codes and categories forthcoming from the first phase. However, from a symbolic interactionistic standing, I was not merely interested in <b>the</b> majority viewpoint. <b>Therefore</b> <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> were once again given the opportunity to expand on their answers qualitatively.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the pedagogic practices of primary teachers in Ghana. The major goal was to identify innovative pedagogic practices, {{as well as to}} understand why the transmission practices continue to prevail in a majority of Ghanaian primary classrooms. Using a qualitative approach, the study tried to probe deeply into how and why teachers in Ghana engage with their practices, at the same time, how and where teachers manage to better support their <b>learners</b> in <b>the</b> face of their contextual difficulties. The theoretical framework for this study was based on Schulman’s theory on teacher knowledge. Schulman proposed that, for teachers to be able to support their learners, they must be able to combine content knowledge, curricular knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) : of the three he argued that it was PCK that teachers needed most in order to make sense of teaching. Thus this study has examined what constitutes teacher knowledge in Ghana and found that, primary teachers add on the traditional and cultural knowledge systems to teaching and learning processes in Ghana. The major instruments used for the study were observations and interviews. The study employed two stages of observations; the first stage of unstructured lesson observations of 40 teachers revealed pedagogic variations (supportive and unsupportive) in Ghanaian classrooms. The second stage of structured lesson observations enabled categorizations of the pedagogic practices. Follow-up interviews unearthed teachers’ views and understanding of their practices. The analysis of the study revealed two categories of primary teachers in Ghana; the traditional and innovative. All teachers in the study relied on the traditional and cultural knowledge systems; but whilst a majority (36 out of 40) validated their transmission rote practices from the culture, there were a few (6 out of 40) who had deeply reflected on the positive aspects of the culture making learning more flexible and supportive for their children. The study concludes that teachers in Ghana would experience more successes in their classrooms when they begin to embrace fully the positive aspects of the cultural knowledge. They will also begin to find alternative strategies to address the contextual challenges they often encounter in their classrooms. <b>Therefore</b> <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> cultural background ought to be promoted and embedded in the teaching as it stands as an all-inclusive and empowering agenda for the teaching practice.

It is much needed for students of English Education in university level because {{in the process of}} teaching and learning the lecturer always asks them to give opinions. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> should master it. To make them easy to express their ideas orally in teaching learning process, the researcher uses a series and single picture as media in speaking teaching learning process. The problem of the study are: (1) how is the student score in speaking taught by using a series picture?, (2) how is student score in speaking taught by using a single picture?, and (3) which media are more effective to improve the students’ ability in speaking. The purposes of this research are: (1) to know the students’ score in speaking taught by using a series picture, (2) to know the students’ score in speaking taught by using a single picture and (3) to know which media are more effective to improve the students’ ability in speaking. 	The design of the research is the comparative study. The samples that the researcher used are 31 students. To get the sample the researcher uses a random sample. To obtain the research data the researcher uses test. Whereas, to find out a significant different score on the students’ speaking when they are taught by using a series picture and when they are taught by using a single picture, the researcher uses t-test formula. The result of data analysis shows that the student’s score taught by using a series picture is bigger than taught by using a single picture. Based on statistical analysis shows that (8, 846 > 2, 042). It means that there is a significant influence between score of teaching by using a series picture and by using a single picture. It can be concluded that the students get good scores in achieving speaking after taught by using a series picture. The students speaking improve significantly so, teaching speaking by using a series picture is effective to improve students’ achievement on speaking. Therefore, it can be used as one of reference media to teach English especially speaking...|$|R

Gielen, Tops, Dochy, Onhema, and Smeets (2010) highlighted that teacher feedback is more complex than peer feedback and usually is interpreted by <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> as more reliable and effective. “Teachers also bring expertise in judgment from experience on similar tasks, giving them insight into various ways to solve the assignment and in <b>the</b> difficulties previous <b>learners</b> encountered” (<b>p.</b> 144).|$|R
40|$|Few {{teachers}} will {{disagree with the}} importance of helping language learners become more autonomous, {{but in spite of}} widespread agreement on the importance of autonomy and independence, there remains a good deal of uncertainty about their application to language education. For instance, some people believe that autonomy is something that teachers do to their learners; in other words that it is a new methodology. This is not true, but it is not entirely false either, for learners are unlikely to become autonomous without active encouragement from their teachers. <b>Therefore</b> <b>the</b> development of <b>learner</b> autonomy will depend crucially on the initiatives teachers take. The question is, what kinds of initiatives should teachers take? First of all it is necessary for teachers' attitudes to learning and teaching to change...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For 20 years, {{researchers}} have envisioned artificially intelligent learning companions that evolve {{with their students}} as they grow and learn. However, while communication theory suggests that positivity decreases over time in relationships, most tutoring systems designed to build rapport with a student remain adamantly polite, and may <b>therefore</b> inadvertently distance <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> from <b>the</b> agent over time. We present an analysis of high school friends interacting in a peer tutoring environment as a step towards designing agents that sustain long-term pedagogical relationships with learners. We find that tu-tees and tutors use different language behaviors: tutees express more playful-ness and face-threat, while tutors attend more to the task. This face-threat by the tutee is associated with increased learning gains for their tutor. Additionally, {{a small sample of}} partners who were strangers learned less than friends, and in these dyads increased face-threat was negatively correlated with learning. Our findings support the idea that learning companions should gradually move to-wards playful face-threat as they build relationships with their students...|$|R

40|$|In Japanese {{language}} education, {{communication skills}} {{have tended to}} be discussed from an aspect of either “other people and relationships” or “logicality and thinking abilities”. In order to integrate the two aspects, our study focused on the argumentation theory. Based on this theory, four elements are essentiol for bringing discussions to a successful conclusion: claim, evidence, reasoning, and rebuttal. We believe in particular that integration of the two aspects in communications will be materialized by extracting experiences of <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> through reasoning. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>the</b> objective of this study is clarification of the process of required interactions in discussions between <b>the</b> <b>learners,</b> and between <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> and a teacher, in order to achieve increased quality of reasoning, which utilize analogies based on <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> own experiences. As a result of an analysis of practices, it was revealed there were two phases in the interaction, which extracts high-quality reasoning through discussions. In the first phase, evidence is reanalyzed after encountering “evidence from a new viewpoint”, or an “rebuttal that denies <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> own opinion”. In the next phase, <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> sympathizes with <b>the</b> other opininons through “reasoning from a standpoint of the other person”. Through these phases, <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> begin to consider “if I were in that situation”. “Questioning and asking explanation for reasoning” at this point leads to extraction of high-quality reasoning. 本稿では、中学 2 年生を対象とした実験授業を分析し、生活経験から類推した質の高い理由づけが引き出されるためには、議論の中でどのような教師と学習者及び学習者間の相互作用が必要となるのか、その過程を明らかにすることを目的とする...|$|R

40|$|The current life knows a {{remarkable}} development which changes {{all aspects of}} our life such as: our working environment, educational system, traveling patterns, sport activities…etc. The busy lifestyle faced by individuals today and the fast pattern of life may lead to their inability {{to be involved in}} a process of education. There is also a considerable technological development, especially the development of computing and communication technology. All these factors led to the idea of the need to reduce the time and to benefit from this technology, particularly in the field of education. The way of the classical education is very slow, and the student is obliged to be present at specific times which may be inappropriate for <b>the</b> majority of <b>learners.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> substantial funds allocated for the success of classical learning process. Thus, it emerged the so-called E-learning via the Internet; the aims of this new mode of learning across the network (web) are to reduce the time of a process of learning –education- as well as to erase the drawbacks of the classical way of education. <b>Therefore,</b> in E-learning, <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> is not forced to be present at specific times, but he is free to choose the time of learning, which is appropriate with his schedule. Another point that is the adaptation of the content (courses) with the intellectual and social characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> and with his background (previous knowledge), which is the main task for each educational system. The technology of Multiagent system is relevant in this area...|$|R
