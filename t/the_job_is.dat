50|$|In a {{secondary}} sector, <b>job</b> management <b>is</b> entitled to complete control {{because there is}} a larger turnout. Many in this job type either leave or are replaced quickly.

25|$|When {{a job is}} newly created, it is {{automatically}} suspended (or paused). It has to be explicitly resumed to be activated. Resuming moves the job to the queued state.

25|$|While most medical {{transcription}} agencies prefer {{candidates with}} a minimum of one year experience, formal instruction is not a requirement, and there is no mandatory test. Some hospitals require nothing more than a diploma for employment as a medical transcriptionist. The average pay range for an in-house MT in a hospital setting is $8/hr. However, MT/HDS can expect to receive anywhere from $12-$19 an hour, depending if they are working in a union or non-union environment. This large gap is because <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> based on production, so the more an MT can produce, the more they can make.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{advances}} in speech recognition technology have shifted the job responsibilities of medical transcriptionists from not only transcribing but also editing. Editing {{has always been}} a part of the medical transcriptionist job, however now editing is a larger requirement as reports are more often being transcribed electronically. With different accents, articulations, and pronunciations, speech recognition technology can still have problems deciphering words. This is where the medical transcriptionist editor steps in. Medical transcription editors will compare and correct the transcribed file to the voice-recorded audio file. <b>The</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> similar to medical transcription as editing will use a foot pedal and the education and training requirements are mostly the same.|$|E

UE has a strong training program for its stewards, distributes a Steward Kit that includes the exemplary “UE Steward Handbook,” and publishes a monthly publication, the UE Steward, that provides tactical tips to stewards and local officers for dealing with workplace problems.|$|E

The tasks a person in this position has are both wide and varied, and often include ensuring that the right staff members are hired and properly trained, making plans for the business' success, and monitoring daily operations.

In some cases, the person who he, starts or owns the business serves as its administrator, but this is not always the case, as sometimes a company hires an individual for the job.|$|E
25|$|BITS {{provides}} API {{access to}} control jobs. A job can be programmatically started, stopped, paused, resumed, and queried for status. Before starting a job, a priority {{has to be}} set for it to specify when <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> processed relative to other jobs in the transfer queue. By default, all jobs are of Normal priority. Jobs can optionally be set to High, Low, or Foreground priority. Background transfers are optimized by BITS, which increases and decreases (or throttles) the rate of transfer based {{on the amount of}} idle network bandwidth that is available. If a network application begins to consume more bandwidth, BITS decreases its transfer rate to preserve the user's interactive experience, except for Foreground priority downloads.|$|E
25|$|Because R. romandi nests {{can often}} be found on buildings, {{it is common for}} wasp nests to be built in heavily human {{populated}} areas. Their nests do not cause any structural damage, so if the nests are located in out of the way areas, they are best left alone. Attempting to knock them down will induce the aggressive behavior described above, and R. romandi tend to rebuild nests in similar spots. Additionally, paper wasps feed their young on caterpillars, so they can help eliminate common garden and agricultural pests. If one does {{have to get rid of}} a nest, it is recommended that <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> done by a professional exterminator, or with a fast acting can of insecticide. The best time to get rid of an R. romandi nest is at dawn or after dark when the wasps are most docile.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} recent {{approaches}} to work design, the Interdisciplinary Approach is based on the use of careful assessment of current job design, followed by a cost/benefit analysis, and finally changes based on the area in which a job is lacking. The assessment is conducted using the Multi-method Job Design Questionnaire, which is used to determine if <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> deficient in the areas of motivational, mechanistic, biological, or perceptual motor support. Motivational improvements are aligned with the Job Characteristics theory dimensions. Mechanistic improvements are focused on improving the efficiency of the job design. Biological improvements focus on improvements to ergonomics, health conditions, and employee comfort. Finally, perceptual motor improvements focus on the nature and presentation of the information an employee must work with. If improvements are identified using the questionnaire, the company then evaluates the cost of making the improvements and determines if the potential gains in motivation and performance justify those costs. Because of the analysis and cost/benefit components of the Interdisciplinary Approach, it is often less costly for organizations and implementations can be more effective. Only changes deemed to be appropriate investments are made, thus improving motivation, productivity, and job satisfaction while controlling costs.|$|E
