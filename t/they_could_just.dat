5|$|From 1988, environmentalists started {{actively}} {{opposing the}} Triangle Link. The most active were the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, who stated that the road would have serious consequences for the local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. Instead, they recommended that the municipalities chose a pontoon bridge. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who argued to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections, to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as well be 60 as 15 years. He instead wanted to collect tolls in advance.|$|E

Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E
25|$|Marlovians {{argue that}} if Frizer, Poley and Skeres could lie about what happened, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as easily have been lying about the {{identity}} of the corpse itself. In other words, that although they claimed it was Marlowe's—and {{as far as we know}} they were the only ones there in a position to identify him—it was in fact someone else's body that the jury was called upon to examine.|$|E

50|$|With a total {{wheelbase}} of only 48 ft the V class {{could be}} turned on the 50 ft turntables at many branch line termini. The total length over the buffers was 57 ft, giving the impression that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> only <b>just</b> fit onto the turntable.|$|R
25|$|This is {{the reason}} why {{injuries}} effect an athlete so much, as if any normal person got an injury <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> work around it, but for an athlete, this causes them to be separated from their sport and could mean a loss of identity is established. Normal, everyday people have skills in all aspects of their life, and have support all around them in everything they do; and as athletes are so focused on their sports, when they break out into everyday life {{they are less likely to}} achieve their further meaning in life relating to their career and future life options due to their inability to develop themselves as people in their early lives.|$|E

25|$|While it is {{possible}} to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact David Bohm invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The question of whether a random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables are not constrained, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption—that the size of the observable universe puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a quantum computer would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially achievable task in quantum mechanics.|$|E

5000|$|Most double rifles {{manufactured}} today, {{especially those}} designed for dangerous game, are manufactured with selective ejectors which greatly speeds reloading. However many old hunters preferred non-ejector rifles, feeling that with practice <b>they</b> <b>could</b> reload <b>just</b> as quickly, these rifles {{can still be}} found and usually attract a slightly lower price.|$|R
50|$|The band {{chose to}} leave Interscope before {{independently}} releasing their follow up album, Keep No Score. The split was amicable, with Ryan O'Neal saying that {{working with the}} label had overall been a positive experience, but the band was so hands-on with the process that <b>they</b> felt <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do <b>just</b> as well independently.|$|R
500|$|During the Utopia storyline, the X-Men {{leave their}} San Francisco base and {{establish}} the island [...] "Utopia" [...] for mutants on {{the remains of}} Asteroid M. [...] The anthology series [...] explores the characters' reactions to this relocation, with Anole featuring in his own story, [...] "Big Boy Pants". [...] The story depicts Cannonball teaching the younger X-Men how to farm their own crops, but Anole argues {{that it is a}} waste of time since <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> buy their food from a store. [...] He looks to Magik for agreement, but she responds by teleporting him to Limbo for five days without food or water. [...] Eventually she returns to bring him water, and Anole tells her that he learned his lesson: without their own food supply, the mutant race could die. [...] Magik informs him that this was not a lesson and that she merely sent him to Limbo because she was sick of looking at him. [...] She returns them both to Utopia and Anole resumes farming, too afraid of Magik to tell anyone what happened. He is almost killed by the mutant Sack, who wanted his own corner of Utopia.|$|E
2500|$|... "These days {{a lot of}} well-meaning people {{yearn for}} the {{supposedly}} purer days of the past. They feel that if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> retrieve historic Seventh-day Adventism and bathe in its supposedly clearer waters, they'd {{be better able to}} resist last-day influences.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, Girard {{has made}} room for {{positive}} imitation. But as Adams implies, {{it is not}} clear how the revised theory accords with earlier claims about the origin of culture. [...] If beneficial imitation is possible, then it is no longer necessary for cultures to be born by means of scapegoating; <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as well be born through healthy emulation. Nidesh Lawtoo further develops the healthy side of mimetic contagion by drawing on a Nietzschean philosophical tradition that privileges [...] "laughter" [...] and other gay forms of [...] "sovereign communication" [...] in the formation of [...] "community." ...|$|E
60|$|Our {{friends had}} a good start {{and were able to}} {{maintain}} it, for with their eight wings <b>they</b> <b>could</b> go <b>just</b> as fast as could the Gargoyles. All the way to the great rock the wooden people followed them, and when Jim finally alighted {{at the mouth of the}} cavern the pursuers were still some distance away.|$|R
6000|$|... "That don't matter so much," [...] said Stalky. [...] "But the house-masters {{let their}} houses alone, and they leave {{everything}} to the prefects.

50|$|Once in position, horse {{artillery}} {{crews were}} trained to quickly dismount, deploy or unlimber their guns (detach them from their caissons), then rapidly fire grapeshot, shells or round shot at the enemy. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> then <b>just</b> as rapidly limber-up (reattach the guns to the caissons), remount, {{and be ready to}} move to a new position, similar to the shoot-and-scoot tactics of their modern counterparts.|$|R
2500|$|This is the {{argument}} that all true atheists are at heart lying {{so that they may}} live {{in a way that is}} contrary to God's commands (as seen in particular interpretations of Romans 1:18-25). Critics note that there are atheists who are not lying and are not using their atheism as an escape to sin. Proponents note, however, that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> as easily still be lying, perhaps not to others anymore but themselves (i.e. loving the wrong woman argument). Some have claimed this argument, however, fails to account for Stephen Maitzen's point on the demographics of theism. If all atheists are liars, why are people in some societies so much more likely to lie than in others? ...|$|E

60|$|He {{leaned back}} on the bench, and fixed {{his eyes on the}} sea, and {{wondered}} languidly what had come to him. Farnaby and the woman, still following, waited round the corner where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> keep him in view.|$|E
40|$|Goldsmith University Media Research Centre {{has just}} {{published}} initial {{results from a}} very extensive project which tells us that a) new media is not bringing nirvana and b) a lot of journalists think quality is declining.

Please read it here...|$|R
50|$|Initially {{during the}} tour, the concerts were being {{recorded}} without {{the knowledge of}} the musicians, so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be paid <b>just</b> for the performance and not for the recording.

50|$|In several {{meetings}} with UK's President Charlie Wethington, {{they found out}} that the college would have to be taken in by the community college in Hazard since before 1997, Hazard Community College (and a few other community colleges) where components of the University of Kentucky. Plus <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>just</b> establish it as a separate community college due to it having to go through boards, past U.K.'s Board of Regents, and even pass Kentucky legislature.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] the man answered. [...] "I {{told them}} {{that you were in}} number twelve, and that you used this as a dressing-room, but they wouldn't shift.

60|$|Mike {{picked up}} the long basket into which he had thrown the letters after {{entering}} the addresses in his ledger, and they moved off down the aisle.

50|$|In October the Americans {{decided that}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>just</b> invest Aachen {{and let it}} fall in a slow siege, because it {{threatened}} the flanks of the U.S. Ninth Army. As {{it was the first}} major German city to face capture, Hitler ordered that the city be held at all costs. In the resulting battle, the city was taken, at a cost of 5,000 casualties on both sides, with an additional 5,600 German prisoners.|$|R
2500|$|Even though DC Comics {{does not}} own {{the rights to}} the [...] "Superboy" [...] name, Geoff Johns and Dan DiDio have stated that the {{decision}} to kill off the character {{had nothing to do with}} the court case, and that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have <b>just</b> renamed the character. Following the conclusion of Infinite Crisis, Didio compared Superboy's death to Spock's death in [...] (who was subsequently resurrected), and also stated that he was [...] "as dead as Blue Beetle".|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't speak. At {{that moment}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> have done <b>just</b> what they liked with me. And {{then the door}} opened very quietly and closed again.

60|$|Marco {{made the}} {{discovery}} that the boat was gone, just after finishing his dinner, and he immediately gave the alarm.

6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] said Mr. Adams, {{raising his}} {{trembling}} hand. [...] "All be quite for a moment. Agatha!" [...] he called as loudly as he could. [...] "Listen to me."

60|$|In half an {{hour the}} breeze had {{increased}} {{so much that the}} boat was running along three knots an hour. By eight o'clock she was doing a knot better.

50|$|Large organisations, or {{users with}} mission {{critical}} projects, need the security fixes but would often prefer {{to retain the}} same base version {{for an extended period}} without any new or changed functionality. Their concern is, that as software developers add new features they can accidentally introduce new bugs or break old functionality. While in theory <b>they</b> <b>could</b> backport <b>just</b> the security fixes from each new release to their deployed version, in practise this would often be prohibitively difficult or costly.|$|R
5000|$|When asked {{directly}} {{about the}} story in the book Conversations with Tom Petty, Petty responded: [...] "Urban legend. It's become a huge urban myth down in Florida. That's just not at all true. The song {{has nothing to do with}} that. But that story really gets around... They've really got the whole story. I've even seen magazine articles about that story. 'Is it true or isn't it true?' <b>They</b> <b>could</b> have <b>just</b> called me and found out it wasn't true." ...|$|R
5000|$|One of Wallace's {{close friends}} in the Army {{described}} him as follows: [...] "I played golf with the General. That was an accident. Colin was needed by the General. Everyone needed him. <b>They</b> <b>just</b> <b>could</b> not do without him." ...|$|R
