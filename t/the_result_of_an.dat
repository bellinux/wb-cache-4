25|$|Woodbury was {{originally}} {{formed as a}} borough on March 27, 1854, within Deptford Township, based on <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> referendum held on March 22, 1854.

30|$|In this section, we {{will first}} present and discuss <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> general proof <b>of</b> concept study, {{showing that the}} {{proposed}} mechanisms are providing better results.

5|$|A {{spontaneous}} CSF leak is idiopathic, {{meaning the}} cause in unknown. Various scientists and physicians {{have suggested that}} this condition may be <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura. It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate some type of generalized connective tissue disorder. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common connective tissue disorders associated with SCSFLS.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Ken Flower, then the {{director}} of Rhodesia's Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), Harper's downfall was <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extramarital affair with a young secretary in the Rhodesian civil service who the CIO discovered was an agent for MI6. Flower informed Smith of this on 3 July and the Prime Minister demanded Harper's resignation that afternoon; Harper acquiesced the next day. Because this was kept secret (presuming it is true), Harper's sudden departure from the Cabinet was interpreted by many observers {{at the time as}} the culmination of the personal and political rivalry between Smith and Harper, or the result of disagreements over the new constitution.|$|E
5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} {{stewards}} {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for crossing the pit light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before he crossed the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the obligatory front floor deflection test. As the team pointed out, the irregularity was <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact on track, allowing him to keep eighth on the grid.|$|E

5|$|After the war Alvarez was {{involved}} in the design of a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber that allowed his team to take millions of photographs of particle interactions, develop complex computer systems to measure and analyze these interactions, and discover entire families of new particles and resonance states. This work resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968. He {{was involved}} in a project to x-ray the Egyptian pyramids to search for unknown chambers. With his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, he developed the Alvarez hypothesis which proposes that the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs was <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> asteroid impact.|$|E
5|$|As {{champions of}} the Atlantic Coast Conference, Virginia Tech was awarded an {{automatic}} bid to the Orange Bowl game.

5|$|Because of its {{position}} more than 2,000 {{miles from the}} nearest continental landmass, the island of Hawaii {{is one of the most}} geographically isolated landmasses on Earth; this in turn has strongly influenced its ecology. The majority of the species present on the island are endemic to it and can be found nowhere else on Earth, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> isolated evolutionary lineage sheltered from external biotic influence; this makes its ecosystem vulnerable both to invasive species and human development, and an estimated third of the island's natural flora and fauna has already gone extinct.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses. In Newton's model, gravity is <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was troubled by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.|$|E
5|$|During {{his final}} years, Narayan, ever fond of conversation, would spend almost every evening with N. Ram, the {{publisher}} of The Hindu, drinking coffee and talking about various topics until well past midnight. Despite his fondness of meeting and talking to people, he stopped giving interviews. The apathy towards interviews was <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interview with Time, after which Narayan had {{to spend a few}} days in the hospital, as he was dragged around the city to take photographs that were never used in the article.|$|E
5|$|Herb and Sadie are soon {{engaged to}} be married, but as Sadie has been {{promoted}} from saleslady to firm buyer she must cancel the wedding date to sail to Paris for the job, saddening Herb. Sadie prepares to leave, but then receives a message from Herb, which informs her {{that he is in}} the hospital as <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> accident. Sadie chooses to visit him, and she decides to forgo her new job and marry Herb instead, Herb revealing that his father {{is the president of the}} subway company.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, an enquiry {{investigated}} the Fremantle Prison riot that {{occurred at the}} start of the year. The report suggested that little evidence supported the escape plan theory reported by the media, but that the riot was largely <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> incident of that morning involving the mistreatment of a prisoner and his subsequent release into Three Division yard.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, two {{trucking}} {{company officials}} {{were sentenced to}} federal prison for violating hours of service regulations. Charles Georgoulakos Jr. and his brother, James Georgoulakos were sentenced to four months in prison, eight months in home confinement, and one year of supervised release. Their company, C Trucking Company of Londonderry, New Hampshire, was placed on two years probation and fined $25,000 (the maximum amount). The sentences were <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> investigation which began {{when one of the}} trucking company's drivers was involved in a collision on Interstate 93 in Londonderry on Aug. 2, 1995, in which four individuals were killed.|$|E

While a student, Johnston's singing was adversely affected by a broken nose, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unprovoked attack in a Carlisle nightclub on New Year's Day, 2014.|$|E

5|$|Interstellar {{molecules}} {{are formed}} by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar {{clouds of dust}} and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often as <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interaction with a cosmic ray. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E
5|$|Jean-FranÃ§ois Champollion was {{the last}} of seven {{children}} (two of whom died before he was born). He was raised in humble circumstances; his father Jacques Champollion was a book trader from Valjouffrey near Grenoble who had settled {{in the small town of}} Figeac in the Department of Lot. His father was a notorious drunk, and his mother seems to have been largely an absent figure in the life of young Champollion, who was mostly raised by his older brother Jacques-Joseph. One biographer, Andrew Robinson, even speculated that Champollion was not in fact the son of Jacques Champollion's wife Jeanne-FranÃ§oise Gualieu, but <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extramarital affair.|$|E
5|$|LambertâEaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS) {{is a rare}} autoimmune disorder {{characterized by}} muscle weakness of the limbs. It is <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> autoimmune reaction in which antibodies are formed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply). The prevalence is 3.4 cases per million. Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer; it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (a condition that arises {{as a result of}} cancer elsewhere in the body).|$|E
