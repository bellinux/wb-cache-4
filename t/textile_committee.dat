2500|$|The strike {{represented}} {{the high point}} for union hopes of organizing textile workers in the South {{for the next several}} decades. When the CIO formed the <b>Textile</b> Workers Organizing <b>Committee</b> three years later, the TWOC focused on northern manufacturers outside the cotton industry. TWOC's successor, the Textile Workers Union of America, faced similar problems organizing in the South; the CIO's postwar organizing drive in the South fell apart chiefly [...] because of its inability to organize textile workers there.|$|R
5000|$|In 1937, the Committee for Industrial Organization (later the Congress of Industrial Organizations or CIO) {{formed the}} <b>Textile</b> Workers Organizing <b>Committee</b> (TWOC) as an {{alternative}} to the UTW.

The TWUA led numerous organizing campaigns in the union-resistant South, aiming to help textile workers achieve higher wages, health insurance and other benefits, and to ensure fair labor practices.|$|R
25|$|The ACWA {{provided}} {{major financial}} support for the <b>Textile</b> Workers Organizing <b>Committee,</b> which sought {{to establish a new}} union for textile workers after the disastrous defeat of the United Textile Workers' strike in 1934. The Textile Workers Union of America, with more than 100,000 members, came out of that effort in 1939 as part of Operation Dixie. The ACWA also helped create the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Workers Union of America through the CIO's Department Store Workers Organizing Committee.|$|R
25|$|But Sidney Hillman, {{president}} of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and a CIO vice president, was adamant that the CIO undertake a comprehensive organizing drive in textiles. Now, {{two years after the}} victories in steel and automobiles, Hillman pressured CIO leaders to force the UTW into an agreement similar to that which had created SWOC. On May 9, 1937, the <b>Textile</b> Workers Organizing <b>Committee</b> (TWOC) was formed. Hillman was named the chairman, and Thomas Kennedy of the United Mine Workers its secretary-treasurer. The committee's other five members included Gorman and Rieve.|$|R
50|$|The Textile Workers' Union of America {{was founded}} in 1939 in Philadelphia. Emil Rieve became its first President and Mariano Bishop was its {{principal}} Organizer.

By the end of World War II the TWUA had organized most textile workers and others in New England with 70,000 Southerners as well, improving wages and conditions greatly.

50|$|The {{number of}} purely {{commercial}} looms working {{throughout the year}} and producing different verities of fabrics only for the market is not very much encouraging.

On the occasion of the visit of Mahatma Gandhi to Sualkuchi on January 9, 1946 one designer Rajen Deka, designed the picture of Gandhiji got it woven in a piece of pat cloth and was presented to him. The woven picture was so fine that even the two broken front teeth of Gandhiji with a smiling face were depicted and while seeing the picture the father of the nation remarked that the weavers could weave dreams in their cloth.|$|R

25|$|Eventually Lewis and {{the other}} {{management}} team members became open {{to the idea of}} a union at the mill, which was aided by the creation National Labor Relations Board and the passing of the Wagner Act. The Wagner Act prevented management at workplaces around the United States interfering with unions. The <b>Textile</b> Workers Organizing <b>Committee</b> was the most prominent union at the West Durham mills and had a presence at the other mill locations in North Carolina. This was the first union at mill in its more than 40 years of existence. The organization of workers led to friction between workers and management in the early 1940s.|$|R
50|$|The CIO found {{organizing}} textile {{workers in}} the South even harder. As in steel, these workers had abundant recent first-hand experience of failed organizing drives and defeated strikes, which resulted in unionists being blacklisted or worse. In addition, the intense antagonism of white workers toward black workers and the conservative political and religious milieu made organizing even harder. On the other hand, some independent left-wing unions, such as Mine, Mill and the Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers Union of America, that aggressively organized {{both black and white}} workers had more success than the more cautious <b>Textile</b> Workers Organizing <b>Committee</b> founded by the CIO.|$|R
25|$|Hillman {{played a}} role in nearly every major {{initiative}} of the CIO in those years, He oversaw, and provided major financial support for, the <b>Textile</b> Workers Organizing <b>Committee,</b> which sought to establish a new union for textile workers after the disastrous defeat of the United Textile Workers' strike in 1934. The Textile Workers Union of America, with more than 100,000 members, came out of that effort in 1939. Hillman also played a decisive role in mediating the internal disputes that nearly destroyed the United Auto Workers in its infancy in 1938 and helped create the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Workers Union of America through the CIO's Department Store Workers Organizing Committee.|$|R

25|$|Russia and India {{have decided}} not to renew the 1971 Indo-Soviet Peace and Friendship Treaty and have sought to follow what both {{describe}} as a more pragmatic, less ideological relationship.

Cooperation between clothing manufacturers of the two countries continues to strengthen. India and Russia signed an agreement on joint efforts to increase investment and trade volumes in the textile industry in both countries.

The organization of workers led to friction between workers and management in the early 1940s.A new labor agreement was signed just prior to World War II on August 22, 1941 that officially recognized the union and stabilized wages for employees. But, the agreement expired in 1943 and the two sides were unable to come to an agreement in 1945 after the union workers released a set of demands that “no other southern cotton mill granted” at the time. [...] Management originally refused to agree to the demands, which included paid holidays, a lunch break and having a person independent of the mill devise the labor agreement. It claimed that the mill could not maintain its profitability if it met the demands of workers and cited the fair treatment it had given them in the past, denying that they violated labor laws.Former Duke University economics professor Frank DeVyver joined management in 1943 specifically to deal with labor disputes and worked out a compromise that satisfied the workers, giving them benefits such as vacation time, lunch breaks and an hourly wage of 65 cents. This was a radical and new type of labor agreement, as few other southern textile mills granted these rights to their workers, especially a 40-minute lunch break. Conditions at the mill had come a long way from the handful of small children who were toiling in the mill 40 years prior.|$|R
