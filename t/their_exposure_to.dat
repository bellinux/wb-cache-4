5|$|Danish workers {{involved}} in the clean-up operation claimed long-term health problems resulted from <b>their</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> the radiation. Although they did not work at Camp Hunziker, the Danes worked at the Tank Farm where the contaminated ice was collected, in the port where the contaminated debris was shipped from, and they also serviced the vehicles used in the clean-up. It {{is also possible that}} they were exposed to radiation in the local atmosphere. Many of the workers surveyed in the years following Project Crested Ice reported health problems. A 1995 survey found 410 deaths by cancers out of a sample of 1,500 workers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} a new {{and important}} cross-sectional determinant of hedge fund returns, <b>their</b> <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> sentiment risk, measured as beta of fund returns to fluctuations in senti-ment proxies. For a large sample of equity-oriented hedge funds, those whose sentiment beta ranks in the top decile subsequently outperform the bottom decile by 0. 67 % per month, after controlling for fund’s <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> existing risk factors. Sentiment risk is also priced in stocks, but it explains only a small friction of the abnormal return spread between high versus low sentiment-beta hedge funds. High sentiment-beta funds tend <b>to</b> increase <b>their</b> <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> sentiment risk the most when doing so {{turns out to be}} profitable.

The true extent of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese {{casualties}} is largely unknown, {{but due to}} <b>their</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>to</b> American firepower, the Communist forces undoubtedly suffered heavy losses. Nonetheless, the successful capture of Loc Ninh exceeded Communist expectations, as they had thought that the South Vietnamese would hold out longer. Lộc Ninh became {{the seat of the}} Provisional Revolutionary Government, the capital of Communist-occupied territories in South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese, in their efforts to hold the district, lost more than three thousand soldiers killed or captured; only about fifty soldiers actually reached An Lộc. The Viet Cong also captured all seven American advisers and an embedded French journalist, Yves-Michel Dumond, in Lộc Ninh; they were taken to a prison camp in Kratié Province, Cambodia. Dumond was released on 14 July 1972. On 12 February 1973, the Americans were released in accordance with the Paris Peace Accord.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} higher-moment market risks in the {{cross-section}} of hedge fund returns to make several contributions. First, {{we show that}} hedge funds are substantially exposed to the three highermoment risks - volatility, skewness, and kurtosis. In contrast, mutual funds do not display meaningful dispersions in <b>their</b> <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> these risks. Further, funds of hedge funds when examined as a separate investment category do not show aggressive loading on higher-moment risks. Second, we provide evidence on economically significant premiums being embedded in hedge fund returns on account of <b>their</b> <b>exposures</b> <b>to</b> higher-moment risks. Third, we uncover a set of higher-moment factors that are not strongly associated with factors in benchmark models that are currently used for evaluating hedge fund performance. Finally, the addition of these higher-moment factors to benchmark models can better explain the variation in hedge fund returns. Bearing on issues of practical consequence, we find that benchmark models augmented with higher-moment factors can considerably alter the hedge funds’ alpha-based rankings...|$|R
