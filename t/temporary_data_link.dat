30|$|SDDL {{has been}} {{deployed}} in a real-world Fleet Tracking and Management application (InfoPAE Móvel) {{of a major}} gas distribution company that operates throughout the entire country of Brazil. Using this application, the company's Operations Center is able to track trajectories of its trucks in real-time, to optimise the trucks' itineraries, to detect and give notice of obstructions or jams on roads and to monitor the vehicle driver's actions (e.g., elapsed time on both planned and involuntary stops). Moreover, it performs simple text messaging with drivers to send them instructions or alerts, both individually {{as well as to}} subgroups of the vehicle's drivers, according to the country region they are currently located. For communication with the vehicles, the company uses any of the four Brazilian cellular network operators because one or the other operator(s) better serves each region of the country. Moreover, in each region, there are significant differences in connectivity quality (e.g., 2 G vs. 3 G) and extension of the wireless coverage. Thus, during a long journey, vehicles may experience several IP address changes and <b>temporary</b> <b>data</b> <b>link</b> disconnections (due to weak coverage or handover latency). Finally, in most cases their 2 G/ 3 G connections will be behind firewalls of the cell operators.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this report is on {{cooperating}} transaction models for design activities, specially {{on the effects of}} allowing exchange of <b>temporary</b> <b>data</b> between concurrent design activities. Since several actors are participating in the cooperation process, the exchange of <b>temporary</b> <b>data</b> must be visible to the actors. The purpose of the transaction model is to describe the effects of the exchange of <b>temporary</b> <b>data,</b> and to minimize the work that must be redone due to changes in the <b>temporary</b> <b>data.</b> The effects of the changes are handled by introducing a (short) transaction each time an access to uncommitted data is done. (exact contents of each transaction?) These transactions are comparable with a savepoint which records where the exchange of data started and what data objects are involved. These transactions are used in cases where work must be undone to maintain consistency. It attempts to reduce the negative effects of the cooperation by invalidating as little work as possible. We use the notion of Sphere of control (SoC) to mean the process that manage the cooperation process for each set of activities. The SoCs are responsible for handling the cooperation during the work, and also to maintain consistency after the activities have nished. The SoC contains all activities that are allowed to interfere in the access of the same data objects. We allo...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} problem of <b>data</b> <b>link</b> in the NAT under a {{technology}} transition framework of value creation, capture, and delivery. Creating value through a new technology, such as <b>data</b> <b>link,</b> refers to designing competitive value propositions for stakeholders. Capturing value means recovering an investment in a technology through the value it creates. Delivering value refers to developing policies and business strategies to enable value capture. Realization of these concepts is necessary to guarantee technology transition. Data was gathered from {{a survey of the}} two major stakeholder groups in the NAT, commercial operators and ANSPs. The survey covered five major research areas: 1) Perceived operational and coordination inefficiencies; 2) Opportunities to improve service; 3) Current and projected <b>data</b> <b>link</b> equipage and infrastructure in the NAT; 4) Value distribution of <b>data</b> <b>link</b> costs and benefits; and 5) Potential policy strategies to encourage <b>data</b> <b>link</b> adoption. The study found that <b>data</b> <b>link</b> creates value for stakeholders through an understanding of the evolution of technology and stakeholder needs. Fuel penalties associated with flying suboptimal flight levels and routes is the largest inefficiency in the NAT. <b>Data</b> <b>link,</b> particularly through the FANS system, is seen as the enabling technology to improve efficiency of operations. Reducing separation is the <b>data</b> <b>link</b> application most valued by stakeholders. (cont.) Coordination and harmonization issues threaten to limit the value created. <b>Data</b> <b>link</b> diffusion (airborne equipage and ground infrastructure) is not always guaranteed as a result of value created due to improvements in technical performance. Value capture is limited due to unbalances in the distribution of <b>data</b> <b>link</b> costs and benefits. So far, <b>data</b> <b>link</b> operational benefits have been significant but have not yet translated into economic benefits given that such applications have not been implemented in the NAT. Delivering value from <b>data</b> <b>link</b> is more than balancing costs and benefits. Uncertainty in a number of issues needs resolution before the value created through <b>data</b> <b>link</b> could be fully captured and delivered. A combination of operational, financial and regulatory schemes may be necessary to leverage costs and benefits and ensure successful <b>data</b> <b>link</b> value delivery to all stakeholders. by Norma Viviana Campos.
