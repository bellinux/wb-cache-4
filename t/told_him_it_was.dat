5|$|While Miller {{was working}} on a BBC Three sitcom he pitched the idea to {{producer}} Stephen McCrum. McCrum criticised the way Miller ended the first script, which ended with Nelson and Marion leave where they live. McCrum <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> best to set the series in a single place rather than have the characters move from one place to another. McCrum then suggested taking Nelson and Marion, and writing a script about them. Later, another writer, Jon Brown came in to write and at this time rules were set out with regards to writing the show, such as the animals could not be dressed in clothes unless it was in a flashback sequence or during a song.|$|E
25|$|In June, 2009, the University of the Cumberlands {{rescinded}} its {{invitation to}} a youth group from Broadway Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas, to help build homes for the poor, stating they did so because the church {{had been removed from}} the Southern Baptist Convention. This action was condemned by Kentucky Equality Federation because the church pastor stated officials <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> because of their tolerance of homosexuality.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday, August 22, {{no other}} sign of Ben had been found. A text message {{was sent to}} Edd Sorenson, a veteran cave diver and {{recovery}} specialist with hundreds of dives to his credit, on his yacht in the Bahamas, where he was leading an expedition. He came to Vortex Springs the next day. Other divers, and an official with an international cave-diving rescue organization, <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too dangerous to go any further than they already had.|$|E

25|$|The Germans {{attacked}} the West on 10 May. De Gaulle activated his new division on 12 May. The Germans broke through at Sedan on 15 May 1940. That day, with three tank battalions assembled, {{less than a}} third of his paper strength, he was summoned to headquarters and told to attack to gain time for General Robert Touchon’s Sixth Army to redeploy from the Maginot Line to the Aisne. General Georges <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> his chance to implement his ideas.|$|E
25|$|A {{prominent}} Connecticut official, State Senator George Gunther, and Andy Kosch, a {{high school}} science teacher, pilot, and Whitehead researcher, said that they heard about yet another photograph. They were told that a sea captain named Brown had made a logbook entry describing Whitehead flying over Long Island Sound and had even photographed the airplane in flight. A friend told Kosch {{that he had found}} the captain's leather-bound journal containing a photo of Whitehead in flight and a description of the event. After some difficulty Kosch made contact with the owners of the journal, but they <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> lost.|$|E
25|$|Larocque {{spent the}} long winter {{in a nearby}} workshop, {{carefully}} supervising the assembly of the arches that were to form the domed roof. The 12 main arches were supplemented by 24 secondary ones and 72 smaller arches. His work also aroused some interest from Ottawa since the blueprints had failed to earn a permit, and more generally {{because he was not}} a registered architect. When they heard construction had begun nonetheless, they tried to have the work stopped. Bishop Paul Piché hired an engineering consultant to visit the building, who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> sturdy enough to last another 200 years.|$|E
5000|$|Visionary Giganoid: Der Zerstreute (Movie): A Giganoid {{created by}} Voffa {{to obtain the}} Fearsome Burstosaur. However, by the time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> completed, Lije <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> no longer needed. Voffa, refusing to accept that he wasted his time, vainly {{attempting}} to have his creation appear on the [...] "Kamen Rider 555: Paradise Lost" [...] movie that followed by force if needed.|$|R

25|$|On 2 October Hindenburg {{told the}} Kaiser’s Crown Council that Germany {{could no longer}} win a {{military}} victory, and the following day a new government was formed under Prince Max, which approached President Wilson for peace based on the Fourteen Points. When Haig met Foch on 6 October, Foch showed him the newspaper reports of this and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{a direct result of}} the BEF breach of the Hindenburg Line at its strongest point, although the almost simultaneous capitulation of Bulgaria was also a factor and discussions would continue for a month until the ceasefire on 11 November. At the meeting Haig again asked for US divisions for his sector, and was told this was not going to happen.|$|E
25|$|On 7 August 2005, Olmert was {{appointed}} acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in {{protest against the}} planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, {{and so on and}} so on. Now I am sorry he is not alive for me to be able to publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. He was right and I was wrong. Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai. When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.|$|E
25|$|Shi Yi {{was known}} for leading a frugal and humble lifestyle. Unlike many other officials, he did not {{accumulate}} wealth for his family and never accepted financial aid from others. He was content with having only basic necessities. Sun Quan once went {{on a tour of}} Shi Yi's neighbourhood and saw a large mansion. When he asked who the owner of the mansion was, someone <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Shi Yi. However, Sun Quan said that it was definitely not Shi Yi, given his lifestyle. He was proven right. Shi Yi wore very simple clothing and had simple meals every day. He also enjoyed helping the needy so he often donated or gave away his personal savings to the poor. When Sun Quan heard about it, he visited Shi Yi's house and sampled the meals Shi Yi had every day. After the visit, he increased Shi Yi's salary, gave him more rewards and a larger plot of land. However, Shi Yi rejected these rewards and gifts and said that he would feel uneasy if he accepted them.|$|E

5000|$|Afterwards, Marcus {{gets caught}} by a plainclothes officer named Kramer (Jose Zuniga) after he {{continues}} to sell stolen merchandise to the elementary school children and is hauled off to the police station. Marcus is interrogated by Kramer and another detective named Hank (Richard Petrocelli) who threaten to charge him with commercial burglary and inform him that his mother is in prison for murder, not smuggling undocumented aliens like she had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> (<b>it</b> <b>is</b> implied Joanna killed his father.) ...|$|R
500|$|The senior route captain for Australian National Airways, Captain DouglasWay, {{told the}} inquiry {{he was unaware}} Spence was {{treating}} himself with insulin. [...] Captain Way said he knew Spence had been discharged from the RAAF as medically unfit but Spence had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a minor complaint discovered {{when he was in}} Canada and when he returned to Australia he found himself cured.|$|E
500|$|Before Major Charles Sweeney {{took off}} on the mission, Purnell took him aside {{and asked him if}} he knew how much the bomb cost. Sweeney did not know; Purnell <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about $2 billion. He then asked if Sweeney knew how much his {{aircraft}} was worth. This Sweeney did know; over half a million dollars. Purnell then told him: [...] "I'd suggest you keep those relative values in mind for this mission." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite his mixed {{feelings}} on joining the club, Gunn's overall impression {{of his time}} in Edinburgh is upbeat: [...] "I only played 12 games for the Hibees but it was great. We beat Hearts in my only derby game 2–1 (John Robertson scored his 50th goal for Hearts in derbies but I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> worth nothing as we had won) and had a clean sheet at Celtic Park (stopping them from winning the SPL that day)." [...] He received what he described as a [...] "wonderful reception" [...] from Aberdeen fans when playing for Hibernian against his former club.|$|E

500|$|Gröning led {{a normal}} middle-class {{life after the}} war. A keen stamp collector, he was once at his local philately club's annual meeting, more than 40 years after the war, when he fell into a {{conversation}} about politics with {{the man next to}} him. The man <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "terrible" [...] that Holocaust denial was illegal in Germany, and went on to tell Gröning how so many bodies could not have been burnt, and that the volume of gas that {{was supposed to have been}} used would have killed all living things in the vicinity.|$|E
500|$|In {{their writing}} Wellek and Warren {{attempted}} {{to present a}} single voice despite the dominance of individuals. Their success in presenting such a voice has been debated. Wellek later recalled that people often <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> difficult to tell who had written which chapter without consulting the book's introduction. However, the literary scholar C. J. van Rees of Tilburg University notes that Wellek's influences are prevalent in chapters authored by Warren. Aldo Scaglione, {{in a review of}} the second edition, wrote that [...] "one immediately senses the change of hand" [...] between chapters by different authors.|$|E
500|$|Following Jackson's death, {{reports of}} {{his use of}} {{pethidine}} (Demerol) surfaced. Cherilyn Lee, a nurse who provided nutritional counseling to Jackson, said that on April 12, 2009, he asked her for unspecified [...] "products for sleep." [...] On April 19, 2009, he told her the only medicine that would help was propofol. Lee refused, telling him, [...] "Michael, {{the only problem with}} you taking this medication ... is you're going to take it and you're not going to wake up." [...] Jackson dismissed the warning, telling her he had been given the drug before by IV injection and that his doctor <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> safe. He did not name the doctor. [...] An overdose of propofol can cause the patient to stop breathing, leading to a shortage of oxygen and a buildup of carbon dioxide in the body which can lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps not, {{since we}} should have been the persons to relate what we had heard. But, Abercrombie, himself, need have had no scruples about visiting that {{remarkable}} old woman. She's a wonderful creature, Corny, as we must allow, and a prudent general would not fail to respect what she <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> a thousand pities that either the Commander-In-Chief, or the Adjutant-General, had not paid Doortje a visit before they left Albany. My Lord Howe's valuable life might then have been saved." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sam," [...] said Miss Fosbrook, [...] "I once read a sermon, {{that said}} that our conduct in little things does decide the tenor of our lives. You know one moment of hastiness cost Moses the Promised Land; and only a little while ago, we heard how Joash had but few {{victories}} allowed to him, {{because he did not}} think it worth while to strike the ground as often as Elisha <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> the little things that show whether we are to be trusted with great." ...|$|R
60|$|And yet <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> The roar of {{the wheels}} <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> The very feel of the luxurious seat in which he <b>was</b> sitting <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> And to clinch the fact {{and at the same}} time make it harder to believe there were his three companions, Upton, his patrol leader, Harrison and Pat Malone, whom he had {{secretly}} made his hero. Yes, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all true, and yet he couldn't get rid of the idea that sooner or later he would wake up and find it all a beautiful dream.|$|R
500|$|Kemper endeared {{himself to}} his psychiatrists by being a model prisoner, and was trained to {{administer}} psychiatric tests to other inmates. One of his psychiatrists later stated, [...] "He {{was a very good}} worker and this is not typical of a sociopath. He really took pride in his work." [...] Kemper also {{became a member of the}} Jaycees while in Atascadero and stated that he developed [...] "some new tests and some new scales on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory," [...] specifically an [...] "Overt Hostility Scale," [...] during his work with Atascadero psychiatrists. After his second arrest, Kemper stated that being able to understand how these tests functioned allowed him to manipulate his psychiatrists, and admitted that he learned a lot from the sex offenders to whom he administered tests; for example, they <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> best to kill a woman after raping her to avoid leaving witnesses.|$|E
500|$|On December 2, 1922, {{nearly all}} of Hemingway's early writing– his juvenilia and {{apprentice}} fiction, including the duplicates– was lost. He had been sent on assignment to cover the Conference of Lausanne, leaving Hadley, who was sick with a cold, behind in Paris. In Lausanne he spent days covering the conference, and the evenings drinking with Lincoln Steffens. Before setting off to meet him in Switzerland, thinking {{he would want to}} show his work to Steffens, Hadley packed all his manuscripts into a valise which was subsequently stolen at Gare de Lyon train station. Although angry and upset, Hemingway went with Hadley to Chamby (Montreux) to ski, and apparently did not post a reward for the recovery of the valise. An early story, [...] "Up in Michigan", survived the loss because Gertrude Stein had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unprintable (in part because of a seduction scene), and he had stuffed it in a drawer.|$|E
500|$|The town {{is shaken}} by the crime, which causes Bart to feel guilty about his actions. Adding to his guilt is when Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney are upset as well, telling Bart that they would attack the culprit {{critically}} as they did not actually mean what they said about the statue before. Bart begins to fear of the consequences he would face if his actions are to be revealed, and his conscience manifests itself as the statue's severed head, which begins speaking to him. Unable to go on, Bart finally confesses his crime to his family, explaining {{that he thought that}} being popular {{was the most important thing}} in the world that Homer <b>told</b> <b>him.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> then Homer realized that he inspired Bart of his popularity advice that caused him to commit the crime in the first place, and feels extremely guilty of doing so. Bart then decides to return the head back where it belongs, and Homer follows along, holding himself responsible for the events. They are found by the angry mob, returning the story to the beginning.|$|E
