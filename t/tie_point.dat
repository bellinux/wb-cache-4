However, the processing of today’s large point clouds is time-consuming, cumbersome and not automated enough. A basic step of post-processing is the registration of scans from different viewpoints. At present this is still done using artificial targets or <b>tie</b> <b>points,</b> mostly by manual clicking. The aim of this registration step is a coarse alignment, which can then be improved with the existing algorithm for fine registration. The focus {{of this paper is}} to provide such a coarse registration in a fully automatic fashion, and without placing any target objects in the scene. The basic idea is to use virtual <b>tie</b> <b>points</b> generated by intersecting planar surfaces in the scene. Such planes are detected in the data with RANSAC and optimally fitted using least squares estimation. Due to the huge amount of recorded points, planes can be determined very accurately, resulting in well-defined <b>tie</b> <b>points.</b> Given two sets of potential <b>tie</b> <b>points</b> recovered in two different scans, registration is performed by searching for the assignment which preserves the geometric configuration of the largest possible subset of all <b>tie</b> <b>points.</b> Since exhaustive search over all possible assignments is intractable even for moderate numbers of points, the search is guided by matching individual pairs of <b>tie</b> <b>points</b> with the help of a novel descriptor based on the properties of a point’s parent planes.

By improving the precision of image <b>tie</b> <b>point</b> measurement, one can enhance the quality of image orientation. The quality of image tie points is under the influence of several factors such as the multiplicity, the measurement precision and the distribution in 2 D images as well as in 3 D scenes.

Hence, we propose here a method which improves the precision of pose estimation in complex scenarios by adding a second iteration to the classical processing pipeline. The result of a first iteration is used as a priori information to guide the extraction of new tie points with better quality. Evaluated with multiple case studies, the proposed method shows its validity and its high potiential for precision improvement...|$|E
