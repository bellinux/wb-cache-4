5|$|Shilts {{is often}} quoted as {{claiming}} <b>that</b> <b>Ronald</b> Reagan {{neglected to mention}} AIDS publicly until 1987. However, Reagan briefly mentioned AIDS research in questions and answers during a news conference on September 17, 1985.|$|E
5|$|Several {{rumors and}} misconceptions {{have grown up}} around the film, one being <b>that</b> <b>Ronald</b> Reagan was {{originally}} chosen to play Rick. This originated in a press release issued by the studio {{early on in the}} film's development, but by that time the studio already knew that he was going into the Army, and he was never seriously considered. George Raft claimed that he had turned down the lead role. Studio records make clear that Wallis was committed to Bogart from the start.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{question}} <b>that</b> <b>Ronald</b> Reagan Carrier Strike Group had a very successful deployment. The talented and dedicated Sailors of this group demonstrated tremendous operational flexibility and performed {{at the highest levels}} of excellence across the warfare spectrum and core capabilities of the Maritime Strategy. They were warriors, ambassadors, partners and humanitarians. They represent all that is good in our country and I'm profoundly honored to sail with this impressive strike group.|$|E
50|$|Crime Scene: It seems odd <b>that</b> <b>Ronald's</b> {{door was}} locked from the inside. The only other way out was the open window, {{and there was a}} 20-foot (about 6 m) drop below it onto a flower bed, which now shows no sign of being disturbed.|$|R
5000|$|On June 9th, 2016 was {{announced}} and confirmed by several news outlets <b>that's</b> <b>Ronald</b> S. Sullivan Jr. {{will be part}} of the head legal defense [...] "Dream Team" [...] for the convicted ex-NFL New England Patriots football star player Aaron Hernandez double murder case.|$|R

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, Sassoon {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism. He had hoped <b>that</b> <b>Ronald</b> Knox, a Roman Catholic priest and writer whom he admired, would instruct him in the faith, but Knox was too ill to do so. The priest Sebastian Moore was chosen to instruct him instead, and Sassoon was admitted to the faith at Downside Abbey in Somerset. He also paid regular visits to the nuns at Stanbrook Abbey, and the Abbey press printed commemorative editions of some of his poems. During this time he also became interested in the supernatural, and joined the Ghost Club.|$|E
25|$|Two brothers, Ronald and Lance Madison, {{fled the}} scene, but were pursued down the bridge by Gisevius and Faulcon in an unmarked state police vehicle. Faulcon fired his shotgun {{from the back}} of the car at Ronald, a developmentally {{disabled}} man who would later die from his injuries. The autopsy found <b>that</b> <b>Ronald</b> Madison sustained seven gunshot wounds, five of them in his back. Bowen was later convicted of stomping him on the back before he died, though this conviction was overturned for lack of physical evidence. Lance Madison was then taken into custody and charged with eight counts of attempting to kill police officers. He was held in custody for three weeks before being released without indictment.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the best}} known works on the history of HIV is 1987's book And the Band Played On, by Randy Shilts. Shilts contends <b>that</b> <b>Ronald</b> Reagan's {{administration}} dragged its feet in dealing with the crisis due to homophobia, while the gay community viewed early reports and public health measures with corresponding distrust, thus allowing the disease to spread {{and hundreds of thousands of}} people to needlessly die. This resulted in the formation of ACT-UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power by Larry Kramer. Galvanized by the federal government's inactivity, the movement by AIDS activists to gain funding for AIDS research, which on a per-patient basis out-paced funding for more prevalent diseases such as cancer and heart disease, was used as a model for future lobbying for health research funding.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Charlie {{figures out}} <b>that</b> <b>Ronald's</b> cure has been {{disguised}} as a Jenga app on Butch's tablet. He attempts to call Max, but the Gymnast destroys Max's cell phone. Heather then arrives at Shecky's house and reveals to Max that she not only accepted a fortune from Trojgaard to bury the drug, {{but she was the}} one who killed Ronald and Butch.|$|R

500|$|From 1969 to 1984, he edited The Libertarian Forum, also {{initially}} with Hess (although Hess's involvement {{ended in}} 1971). The Libertarian Forum provided {{a platform for}} Rothbard's writing. Despite its small readership, it engaged conservatives associated with the National Review in nationwide debate. Rothbard rejected the view <b>that</b> <b>Ronald</b> Reagan's 1980 election as President was a victory for libertarian principles, and he attacked Reagan's economic program {{in a series of}} Libertarian Forum articles. In 1982, Rothbard called Reagan's claims of spending cuts a [...] "fraud" [...] and a [...] "hoax", and accused Reaganites of doctoring the economic statistics in order to give the false impression that their policies were successfully reducing inflation and unemployment. [...] He further criticized the [...] "myths of Reaganomics" [...] in 1987.|$|E
500|$|... "Invocation" [...] {{was written}} by {{producer}} David Amann, and marked his fifth script contribution to the series. [...] "Invocation" [...] {{was the first of}} two episode of The X-Files to be directed by Richard Compton; he would later go on to direct the eighth season episode [...] "Medusa". Although the episode was the fifth aired in the season, it was actually the sixth one filmed, as evidenced by its production number. A majority of the episode was filmed in Pasadena, California. Many of the extras from the episode auditioned via General Casting, a casting agency. The song <b>that</b> <b>Ronald</b> Purnell sang to Billy to keep him quiet and that was featured as a backmasked message on Scully's tape-recorder is a traditional African American lullaby from the southern United States called [...] "All the Pretty Horses".|$|E
500|$|When Chamorro was elected, George H. W. Bush {{removed the}} embargo <b>that</b> <b>Ronald</b> Reagan had imposed during Sandinista rule and promised {{economic}} {{aid to the}} country. In addition, the United States paid off the past-due debts of Nicaragua that were owed to private banks, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Some people in Chamorro's campaign team were hoping to get $1 billion in aid from the United States to help rebuild the country after the years of civil war, but the Bush administration instead gave $300 million to {{the country in the}} first year of Chamorro's presidency, 1990, and $241 million the year after. [...] Given the devastation that Nicaragua had faced, this aid was not enough to make any serious improvement and the renegotiated loans created even more debt.|$|E
50|$|Gerrit ten Kate was a {{full-time}} motocross rider, who like many undertook his own mechanics. After semi-retirement {{from his own}} career, he guided his nephew Ronald ten Kate through regional motocross series to fourth place in the Dutch national championship. Having founded a workshop undertaking mechanics for other riders during his career, it was noticed <b>that</b> <b>Ronald's</b> bike was fast, which resulted in Gerrit expanding his workshop {{to the point where}} he was selling and maintaining 50/60 bikes per annum.|$|R

50|$|Wheatstone was {{involved}} in various disputes with other scientists through his life regarding his role in different technologies and appeared at times to take more credit than he was due. As well as William Fothergill Cooke, Alexander Bain and David Brewster, mentioned above, these also included Francis Ronalds at the Kew Observatory. Wheatstone was erroneously believed by many to have created the atmospheric electricity observing apparatus <b>that</b> <b>Ronalds</b> invented and developed at the observatory in the 1840s and also to have installed the first automatically recording meteorological instruments there (see for example, Howarth, p158).|$|R
500|$|This was {{the first}} time <b>that</b> <b>Ronald</b> D. Moore wrote a Q-based episode, and he was excited by the idea of giving Picard a near death {{experience}} and Q appearing to the Captain as if he were God. His plan for [...] "Tapestry" [...] was to follow a similar path to Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol, but with Q playing a similar role to the three ghosts in Dickens' story. Moore envisaged three stages to the story, one where Picard is attacked and needs an artificial heart, another with Picard as a child and a third based on the USS Stargazer. He pitched the idea to executive producer Michael Piller, who wasn't enthusiastic about the premise. The combination of that disapproval and the expected cost of filming because of the additional sets required meant that the episode had to be trimmed.|$|E
500|$|In late 1982, Congress {{passed a}} law which forbade the United States from funding groups aiming to {{overthrow}} the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. Then, in 1983, Bedell visited Nicaragua and Honduras along with Representative Robert G. Torricelli. During the trip, Bedell spoke with soldiers, generals, governmental officials {{and members of the}} contras. His conclusion {{at the end of the}} trip was <b>that</b> <b>Ronald</b> Reagan was aiding the contras in violation of federal law. He promised to hold hearings after returning to Congress. Bedell would later join other House Democrats in demanding documents from the White House related to the contras, but the Reagan Administration refused to provide them. Bedell became angrier with the Reagan Administration as the decade wore on. He called his Central American policies [...] "sheer lunacy," [...] saying that the mining of harbors was an act of war. Bedell would retire from Congress before Reagan's actions in Central America would culminate with the Iran-Contra Affair.|$|E
500|$|The casting of Battlestar Galactica Tricia Helfer in [...] "Roadkill" [...] {{stemmed from}} the producers' {{preference}} to hire actors important to Supernatural fanbase. This was the first episode to have the Winchesters as supporting characters, and Kripke felt [...] "Tricia had the charisma to perform the leading role". Kripke enjoyed Emmanuelle Vaugier's work in television series such as Smallville, and believed she was an [...] "easy choice" [...] for the large role of the soon-to-be werewolf Madison in [...] "Heart". Director Kim Manners felt Vaugier brought to the character a vulnerability like that of Lon Chaney, Jr. in The Wolf Man, which made viewers sympathetic. Conspiracy-theorist Ronald of [...] "Nightshifters" [...] was envisioned by writer and consulting producer Ben Edlund as the unsympathetic [...] "semi-drunk Randy Quaid from Independence Day". However, this changed with Chris Gauthier's casting, and Edlund felt <b>that</b> <b>Ronald</b> {{turned out to be}} a [...] "really cool" [...] character fans would enjoy. The producers considered Summer Glau for the role of the zombie Angela for [...] "Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things", but she could not accept due to scheduling conflicts.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire that appeared in early August 2016, Eastwood discussed Donald Trump and how this generation, as he put it, is a [...] "pussy generation." [...] "All these people that say, 'Oh, you can't do that, and you can't do this, and you can't say that.' I guess it's just the times." [...] Eastwood also said {{that while he was}} not endorsing Trump, he did see where he was coming from at times, even though the filmmaker stated that the candidate has said dumb things. [...] "What Trump is onto is he's just saying what's on his mind. And sometimes it's not so good. And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's talked about this judge. And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say. I mean, to predicate your opinion {{on the fact that the}} guy was born to Mexican parents or something. He's said a lot of dumb things. So have all of them. Both sides. But everybody—the press and everybody's going, 'Oh, well, that's racist," [...] and they're making a big hoodoo out of it. Just fucking get over it. It's a sad time in history.'" [...] Eastwood also said, when asked if he was still a Libertarian, that he was a little bit of everything and that he wants this generation to get to work and be more understanding instead of calling people names. [...] "Kick ass and take names," [...] Eastwood said. When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a tough one, isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle. She's made a lot of dough out of being a politician. I gave up dough to be a politician. I'm sure <b>that</b> <b>Ronald</b> Reagan gave up dough to be a politician." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kessler said in {{his book}} that the {{measures}} Woodward took to conceal his meeting with Felt lent [...] "credence" [...] {{to the notion that}} Felt was Deep Throat.

50|$|In 1900 Ronald was {{approached}} by Fred Gaisberg of the recording firm the Gramophone & Typewriter Company, predecessor of EMI. He accepted the post of musical adviser, and was the pianist {{on many of the}} company's early song recordings. Gaisberg calculated <b>that</b> <b>Ronald's</b> varied musical contacts would help the new company recruit the distinguished performers it needed. Ronald helped the company to sign up Melba and other leading singers including Adelina Patti, Charles Santley and Enrico Caruso. He remained closely connected with HMV {{for the rest of his}} career, becoming a director in 1930 and a founder-director of Electrical and Musical Industries (EMI) formed by the merger of HMV with its rival, the Columbia Graphophone Company in 1931.|$|R
