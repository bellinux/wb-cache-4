In the Pritchett family storyline, Gloria (Sofía Vergara) experiences hearing difficulty following the plane ride while a cowboy, Hank (Tim Blake Nelson), flirts with her. Gloria's husband, Jay (Ed O'Neill), takes notice, but Gloria is oblivious to his behavior. Later, Hank grabs Gloria's butt causing Jay {{to tell him}} to back off, which he does.

25|$|Another {{negotiation}} tactic is bad guy/good guy. Bad guy/good guy is {{when one}} negotiator {{acts as a}} bad guy by using anger and threats. The other negotiator acts as a good guy by being considerate and understanding.

25|$|However, {{he later}} {{wrote in his}} report that he blamed Pakistan's poor {{performance}} in the matches on player Shahid Afridi. Younis submitted the report to the PCB where it was somehow leaked to the media. He expressed his anger {{and said that the}} report was confidential – it caused fans, on social media sites, to express disappointment in him to see him shifting the blame onto Afridi. Younis, in the report, accused Afridi of being 'non-serious' during the matches and said Mohammad Hafeez hid his knee injury as well, which also affected their performance. He also said Afridi either performed poorly himself, or that other players did not listen to him as a captain. Regarding the report, he said the PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) were painting him as <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy</b> and skipped meeting with him regarding the issue later on as it is most likely that they leaked the report. He then also scrapped plans of retirement and said he wanted to focus on the leak, despite his contract as coach ending in June 2016.|$|E

500|$|On November 9, 2007, Jay-Z {{appeared}} on the Charlie Rose Show to discuss the album. When asked about how the film gave life to this album, he stated [...] "It's a New York City true story, you know. So {{as soon as the}} movie came on, it was like familiar, things that my pop seen and my uncles seen and, you know, different things like that, things I've seen growing up. So they resonated with me in a way, the story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you know, the way it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies that where you champion <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy,</b> because <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy,</b> you know, he don't seem like a bad guy, and the good guy — I mean the good guys are bad. You know, that complex — the complexity of human beings in this thing was amazing to me. I loved the complexity of the human beings".|$|E

500|$|During editing, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up {{with the}} idea of {{inserting}} [...] "missing reels" [...] into the film. [...] " [...] was about to show an Italian crime movie with Oliver Reed," [...] Rodriguez recalls, [...] "and he was saying, 'Oh, it's got a missing reel in it. But it's really interesting because after the missing reel, you don't know if he slept with a girl or he didn't because she says he did and he says that he didn't. It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we’ve got to do. We've got to have a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and then when we come back, you're arriving in the third act. [...] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where the good guy really turns out to be <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy</b> is really good, and the couple becomes friends. Suddenly, though, in the third act, all bets are off and it's a whole new story anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Bell [...] "wanted {{the snake}} church people {{to end up}} being the good guys." [...] However, the trick would be to {{disguise}} the real bad guys in plain sight. According to Bell, [...] "The way the shows usually work out, Mulder is the one to figure out who the bad guys are. So I went into the story meeting with the idea of having Mulder being wrong. Because Mulder believes so strong it's the other guy, it helped hide the true identity of <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy</b> from the audience." ...|$|E

In 1934 she {{approached}} the producer Basil Dean, the head of Associated Talking Pictures (ATP). Although he expressed an interest in Formby, he did not like the associated demands from Beryl. She also met the representative of Warner Bros. in the UK, Irving Asher, who was dismissive, saying that Formby was [...] "too stupid to play <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy</b> and too ugly to play the hero".

500|$|Price Peterson, {{writing for}} TV.com, gave a glowing review, calling it [...] "the best-yet episode of Veronica Mars". He {{elaborated}} by stating, This episode {{was just a}} total triumph for how it brought together SO MUCH from the past 22 episodes and beyond. I loved the Aaron Echolls assassination. I loved that last image of Duncan enjoying his victory in a perpetual magic hour on some Australian beach. I especially loved the It's a Wonderful Life-esque dream sequence. This episode was so good that even though I knew Beaver was <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy,</b> I still came away shocked {{by many of the}} reveals. That's just good writing right there. Conversely, Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+".|$|E

Part of me did want to stop though. That was definitely the toughest project I've ever worked on. Personal relationships became strained. The stress was overwhelming."

500|$|Near the {{beginning}} of the episode, Praise plays a Russian grandmaster at chess. The Complete X-Files notes that the [...] "chess motif" [...] was carried on throughout the episode, most notably in the fact that The Smoking Man [...] "plays Mulder to a checkmate, using Jeffrey as a pawn." [...] Because of this, and his past actions, many perceived The Smoking Man as the true villain of the story. William B. Davis, who played The Smoking Man, however, felt that the character was the hero of the story. He noted, [...] "I used to go to conventions and try to convince everyone that I was the hero of the series and Mulder was <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy.</b> [...] I got a lot of laughs, but it's certainly true of how one plays the character. Nobody thinks they're evil." ...|$|E
500|$|Prost won {{the first}} two Grands Prix of the 1982 season in South Africa, where Prost {{recovered}} from losing a wheel, and Brazil, where he finished 3rd but was awarded the win after Piquet (1st) and Keke Rosberg (2nd) were disqualified. He finished in the points on four other occasions, but did not win again. Despite retiring from seven races, Prost improved on his Drivers' Championship position, finishing in fourth, but with nine fewer points than the previous year. His relationship with Arnoux deteriorated further after the French Grand Prix. Prost believes that Arnoux, who won the race, went back on a pre-race agreement to support Prost during the race. His relationship with the French media was also poor. He has since commented that [...] "When I went to Renault the journalists wrote good things about me, but by 1982 I had become <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy.</b> I think, to be honest, I had {{made the mistake of}} winning! The French don't really like winners." ...|$|E

He played a high school quarterback in the NBC television series Against the Grain (1993), and a steroid-abusing high school football player in [...] (1994). Affleck's most notable role during this period was as a high school bully in Richard Linklater's cult classic Dazed and Confused (1993). Linklater wanted a likeable actor for <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy</b> and, while Affleck was [...] "big and imposing," [...] he was [...] "so smart and full of life ... I just liked him." [...] Affleck later said Linklater was instrumental in demystifying the filmmaking process for him.|$|E

500|$|This was {{the first}} time the Coen {{brothers}} chose big stars to act in their movie. Joel Silver's first choice for Norville Barnes was Tom Cruise, but the Coens persisted in a desire to cast Tim Robbins. Winona Ryder and Bridget Fonda were in competition for the role of Amy Archer before Jennifer Jason Leigh was cast. Leigh had previously auditioned for a role in the Coens's Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink. Her failed auditions prompted the Coens to cast her in The Hudsucker Proxy. To prepare for her role as Amy Archer, Leigh read the biographies of some of the most substantial ladies of the thirties and forties such as, Rosalind Russell, Katharine Hepburn and Jean Arthur. When casting the role of Sidney Mussburger, [...] "Warner Bros. suggested all sorts of names," [...] remembered Joel. [...] "A lot of them were comedians who were clearly wrong. Mussburger is <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy</b> and Paul Newman brought that character to life." [...] However, the Coens first offered the role to Clint Eastwood, but he was forced to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts.|$|E

500|$|Josh Mapes of The Biography Channel listed {{her in the}} {{category}} [...] "10 Primetime Stars We Love to Hate". He said, [...] "Any great soap opera needs a great villain. While viewers may identify more with the protagonist, the villains in a serial drama always spice things up, cause trouble, {{and make it more}} fun to watch. From tongue lashings to catfights, underhanded tricks to boldface lies, the characters we love to hate have each brought a fair share of great moments to primetime soaps. While Larry Hagman played <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>guy</b> on Dallas, Donna Mills played bad girl on its spin-off, Knots Landing. Unapologetically going after what she wanted, Mills' character engaged in affairs with two of the husbands on the Knots Landing cul-de-sac.
