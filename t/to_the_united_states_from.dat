5|$|Alligator weed was {{introduced}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>from</b> South America. It takes root in shallow water, interfering with navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The alligator weed flea beetle {{and two other}} biological controls were released in Florida, greatly {{reducing the amount of}} land covered by the plant. Another aquatic weed, the giant salvinia (Salvinia molesta) is a serious pest, covering waterways, reducing water flow and harming native species. Control with the salvinia weevil (Cyrtobagous salviniae) and the salvinia stem-borer moth (Samea multiplicalis) is effective in warm climates, and in Zimbabwe, a 99% control of the weed was obtained over a two-year period.|$|E

5|$|In James Monroe's annual {{address to}} the {{legislature}} in December 1822, he called on Congress to report on how to best deal with the Seminoles that inhabited the recently acquired territory of Florida. As chair of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Metcalfe delivered the report on February 21, 1823. His committee found that, {{under the terms of}} the Adams-Onis Treaty that transferred control of Florida <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>from</b> Spain, the Seminoles were to be accorded the same privileges as U.S. citizens. Accordingly, the committee recommended that each Seminole family be given a land grant. They hoped that this would help break the tribal loyalties of the Seminoles and expedite their amalgamation into white society. The committee's report was largely ignored.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant flew <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>from</b> England in August 1941 to {{find out}} why Briggs and his {{committee}} were apparently ignoring the MAUD Report. Oliphant discovered to his dismay that the reports and other documents sent directly to Briggs had not been shared with all members of the committee; Briggs had locked them in a safe. Oliphant then met with Allison, Coolidge, Conant and Fermi to explain the urgency. In these meetings Oliphant spoke of an atomic bomb with forcefulness and certainty, and explained that Britain did not have the resources to undertake the project alone, so it was up to the United States.|$|E

5|$|Quinceañera {{was written}} and {{directed}} by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland, filmmaking partners and a romantic couple. They conceived the idea for the film in January 2005, based on their own experiences as a white gay couple moving into the predominantly Latino working-class neighborhood of Echo Park, Los Angeles, as the area underwent gentrification. They were inspired to make a film about the traditional quinceañera celebration after being invited to their fifteen-year-old neighbor's ceremony. With producer Anne Clements, they pitched the idea to three investors—immigrants <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>from</b> Greece and Israel—who agreed to provide $300,000 to finance the project. (The budget was later raised to $400,000.) Glatzer and Westmoreland then wrote the screenplay over three weeks in February.|$|E
5|$|The 1945 Japan–Washington {{flight was}} a record-breaking air voyage made by three {{specially}} modified Boeing B-29 Superfortresses on September 18–19, 1945, {{from the northern}} Japanese island of Hokkaidō to Chicago in the Midwestern United States, continuing to Washington, D.C. The flight was made by three United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) generals and other airmen returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>from</b> their overseas duty after World War II. At that date, it involved the heaviest load carried by an American aircraft (144,000lb, 65,300kg), the longest nonstop flight made by the USAAF (5,840mi, 9,400km), and the first nonstop flight from Japan to the United States made with a complete aircraft. However the flight did not break the then-world distance record established by the Royal Air Force in 1938.|$|E
