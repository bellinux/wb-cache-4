The pilot was critically acclaimed and viewed by over 12million people, but Studio 60 experienced a significant drop in audience by mid-season. The seething anticipation {{that preceded the}} début was followed up by {{a large amount of}} thoughtful and scrupulous criticism in the press, as well as largely negative analysis in <b>the</b> <b>blogosphere.</b> In January 2007, Sorkin spoke out against the press for focusing too heavily on the ratings slide and for using blogs and unemployed comedy writers as sources. After two months on hiatus, Studio 60 resumed to air the last episodes of season one, which would be its only season.|$|E
5|$|The {{essay was}} {{extensively}} {{discussed in the}} media and <b>the</b> <b>blogosphere,</b> with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.|$|E

500|$|The 2008 American {{young adult}} novel The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins {{has been accused}} of being strikingly similar to Battle Royale in terms of the basic plot premise.

[...] The general consensus in the time since has been one of amicable controversy, especially since the release of The Hunger Games film adaptation.

[...] Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that [...] "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on <b>the</b> <b>blogosphere</b> as a baldfaced ripoff" [...] of Battle Royale but argued that [...] "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently." [...] Stephen King noted that the reality TV [...] "badlands" [...] were similar to Battle Royale, {{as well as his}} own novels The Running Man and The Long Walk.

[...] The New York Observer writer Foster Kamer mused, [...] "remember early Kanye? These guys finally do. 'Otis' is the perfect anti-single for this album, because it's a reminder that what we always loved about these two collaborating is still very much there. Not only do they not need hooks, neither of them need to remind us that they don't.

500|$|Anniemal {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 81, based on 23 reviews, which indicates [...] "universal acclaim". Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork {{referred to the}} songs as a [...] "dozen slices of stylish, sophisticated electro-pop, crisp tracks that move between the fizzy and the woozy, all anchored by Annie's breathy (sometimes almost muted) vocals." [...] The site's endorsement was uncommon during a period when sites covering independent music were often dismissive of pop acts. In his review for AllMusic, Andy Kellman described Anniemal as [...] "cunning" [...] but also [...] "deeply affecting". Dylan Hicks' review for The Village Voice stated that <b>the</b> <b>blogosphere</b> and British music press overrated Anniemal but that [...] "an overrated good record is still a good record". Jody Rosen wrote for The New York Times that the album [...] "is a true album, strong from top to bottom" [...] and that [...] "there is charm in [...] deadpan delivery, and her songwriting is full of the flair for melody for which Scandinavian pop is famous." [...] Rosen also contributed a review to Slate, where she noted that [...] "other singers have made whole careers out of singles less winning than 'Chewing Gum,' but [...] includes several other superb songs". Kitty Empire's review in The Observer stated that the album's songs [...] "boast a winning combination of innocence and experience, breezy blonde melodies and just-so productions". PopMatters Pierre Hamilton called Anniemal [...] "riveting" [...] for how [...] "it lacks the waxy sheen" [...] that listeners were used to hearing in manufactured pop music. However, a second PopMatters review, written by Rob Horning, criticised the album for using a similar formula to previous generations of electropop, adding that the result was [...] "exquisitely empty…enough to suck the feelings out of its listeners and leave them happily vacant, blank and unburdened." [...] In his review for Billboard magazine, Michael Paoletta described the album as [...] "slinky and sensual, cool and classy, fun and fiery" [...] and labeled it [...] "one of the best debut albums of 2005." ...|$|E
