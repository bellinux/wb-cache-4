5|$|In 1962, Kestin and Persen {{published}} a paper describing solutions for heat transfer when the thermal boundary layer is contained entirely within the momentum layer and for various wall temperature distributions. For {{the problem of}} a flat plate with a temperature jump at , they propose a substitution <b>that</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> parabolic thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation. The solution to this equation, the temperature {{at any point in}} the fluid, can be expressed as an incomplete gamma function. Schlichting proposed an equivalent substitution <b>that</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> thermal boundary-layer equation to an ordinary differential equation whose solution is the same incomplete gamma function.|$|E
5|$|After the Sequel was {{inspired}} by Sonic Heroes and other games {{both inside and outside}} the Sonic series, and it was developed with Sonic Worlds, an engine based in Multimedia Fusion 2 <b>that</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> amount of computer programming involved in game creation. It was released as a free download for Microsoft Windows personal computers. The game was very well received by video game journalists, who lauded its preservation of retro Sonic gameplay and its eclectic, 1990s-style soundtrack. The trilogy of Before the Sequel, After the Sequel, and their successor Sonic Chrono Adventure performed unusually well for fangames, having been downloaded 120,000 times by March 2014.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin's {{popularity}} declined {{after the}} development of acetaminophen/paracetamol in 1956 and ibuprofen in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s, John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects, while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anti-clotting agent <b>that</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> risk of clotting diseases. Aspirin sales revived considerably in the last {{decades of the twentieth}} century, and remain strong in the twenty-first with widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes.|$|E

5|$|The USB Power Delivery Specification revision2.0 (USB PD rev. 2) {{has been}} {{released}} {{as part of the}} USB3.1 suite.

Power Delivery protocols have been updated to facilitate Type-C features such as cable ID function, Alternate Mode negotiation, increased VBUS currents, and VCONN-powered accessories.|$|E
5|$|Often, all the mayflies in a {{population}} mature at once (a hatch), and {{for a day or}} two in the spring or autumn, mayflies are everywhere, dancing around each other in large groups, or resting on every available surface. In many species the emergence is synchronised with dawn or dusk, and light intensity seems to be an important cue for emergence, but other factors may also be involved. Baetis intercalaris, for example, usually emerges just after sunset in July and August, but in one year, a large hatch was observed at midday in June. The soft-bodied subimagos are very attractive to predators. Synchronous emergence is probably an adaptive strategy <b>that</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> individual's risk of being eaten. The lifespan of an adult mayfly is very short, varying with the species. The primary function of the adult is reproduction; adults do not feed, and have only vestigial (unusable) mouthparts, while their digestive systems are filled with air. Dolania americana has the shortest lifespan of any mayfly: the adult females of the species live for less than five minutes.|$|E
5|$|One factor <b>that</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> {{chances of}} re-discovering the white-eyed martin is the drastic {{decline in the}} numbers of {{swallows}} wintering at Bueng Boraphet, its only known site, from the hundreds of thousands reported around 1970 to maximum counts of 8,000 made in the winter of 1980–1981. It is not certain whether this represents a real decline or a shift in site in response to persecution. Other potential causes for the species' decline include the disturbance of riverine sand bars, the construction of dams which flood the area upstream and alter the downstream hydrology, deforestation, and increasing conversion of its habitat to agriculture. Very few swallows now roost in the Bueng Boraphet reedbeds, preferring sugarcane plantations, and, despite searching, the white-eyed river martin has not been found in other nearby large swallow roosts. Bueng Boraphet has been declared a non-hunting area in an effort to protect the species, but surveys to find this martin have been unsuccessful. Past surveys include several at Bueng Boraphet, a 1969 survey of the Nan Yom and Wang Rivers of northern Thailand, and a 1996 survey of rivers in northern Laos. A possible unverified sighting was reported in 2004.|$|E

25|$|To achieve optimum noise {{performance}} DFAs are {{operated under}} {{a significant amount}} of gain compression (10dB typically), since <b>that</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> rate of spontaneous emission, thereby reducing ASE.

25|$|Because {{caffeine}} is both water- and lipid-soluble, it readily {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier {{that separates the}} bloodstream from {{the interior of the}} brain. Once in the brain, the principal mode of action is as a nonselective antagonist of adenosine receptors (in other words, an agent <b>that</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> effects of adenosine). The caffeine molecule is structurally similar to adenosine, and is capable of binding to adenosine receptors on the surface of cells without activating them, thereby acting as a competitive antagonist.|$|E
25|$|Homogenization is {{a process}} <b>that</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> size of fat {{globules}} by forcing pressurized, hot milk through small holes, causing turbulence that breaks up the larger fat globules so that they remain suspended rather than separating in a cream layer at the top. The purpose of homogenization is to make milk more convenient to process, store and consume, eliminating the need to shake or stir the milk container to remix the separated cream layer and increasing the shelf-life of the product.|$|E

25|$|The first {{ability is}} a hormone cycle <b>that</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> body's urine production. At about sunset each day, the body {{releases}} a minute burst of antidiuretic hormone (also known as arginine vasopressin or AVP). This hormone burst reduces the kidney's urine output {{well into the}} night so that the bladder does not get full until morning. This hormone cycle is not present at birth. Many children develop it {{between the ages of}} two and six years old, others between six and the end of puberty, and some not at all.|$|E
25|$|A {{major problem}} alleged, <b>that</b> <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> {{effectiveness}} of cable barriers, is the installation below grade, especially around slopes or dips. Without any compensation for a slope in the median, a car can actually jump {{the top of}} a barrier, and therefore be exposed to a potential cross-over collision. Litigation has arisen in Arizona regarding the improper installation of cable barriers. One wrongful death suit resulted in a one million dollar settlement with the state. In Washington state, numerous letters were submitted to the state Department of Transportation complaining of cable barrier installation.|$|E
25|$|In another study, the {{utilization}} of litter mulch under cocoa plantation {{has been reported in}} Papua New Guinea, which has some negative effect on the population of P. palmivora, and therefore could reduce the pod infection especially at the beginning of raining season.
