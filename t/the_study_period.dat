5|$|The {{greatest}} number of fatalities involving one aircraft occurred in 1985 when 520 {{people died in the}} crash of Japan Airlines Flight 123. The most fatalities in an aircraft collision occurred during 1977 in the Tenerife airport disaster when 583 people were killed. The {{greatest number}} of fatalities from a midair collision occurred at the Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision, to the west of New Delhi, India on 12 November 1996 when a Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747-100B en route from Delhi to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, collided with Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76 en route from Chimkent, Kazakhstan to Delhi, killing all 349 people aboard both the airplanes. The 11 September 2001 (9/11) coordinated attack of the World Trade Center claimed not only 157 passengers and crew, but an estimated additional 2,500 victims. In 2012, Boeing released a study of worldwide commercial jet airplane accidents between 1959 and 2011 reporting 1,798 accidents, 603 categorized as fatal, which accounted for 29,025 on-board fatalities and an additional 1,173 ground or non-commercial aircraft collision deaths. The Boeing analysis suggests a decrease of commercial aviation accident fatality rates toward the end of <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E

25|$|A United Arab Emirates (UAE) University report, {{from early}} 2003, {{evaluated}} {{the results of}} a 5-year study on the occurrence of a broad range of osteochondrodysplasias.

30|$|The community-drawn {{resource}} maps were scanned and geo-referenced using Quantum Geographical Information System (QGIS) {{software version}} 1.8. 0. Five coordinates collected in <b>the</b> specific <b>study</b> sites during field observations {{were used as}} control points to guide the geo-referencing exercise. The key features and locations on the geo-referenced images were retraced onto overlaid shapefiles as polygons, lines and points representing <b>the</b> four <b>study</b> <b>periods</b> for <b>the</b> three sites. The extents of the perceived resource changes over <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>periods</b> were determined from the maps using QGIS. The data was then transferred to Excel to generate the graphs and tables showing the extent of resource changes. A chi-square goodness of fit {{test was used to}} determine whether the extent of the resource changes over time differed significantly over <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>periods</b> (Kioko and Okello 2010).|$|R

25|$|However, boreal forests, {{particularly}} those in North America, showed a different response to warming. Many boreal forests greened, but the trend was {{not as strong as}} it was for tundra of the circumpolar Arctic. In North America, some boreal forests actually experienced “browning” (less photosynthetic activity) over <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>period.</b> Droughts, forest fire activity, animal and insect behavior, industrial pollution, {{and a number of other}} factors may have contributed to the browning.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{proposed}} {{causes of}} the decreased rate of warming over the past 15 years include the emission of pine-smelling vapors from pine forests, which {{have been shown to}} turn into aerosols, and the ban on chlorofluorocarbons {{as a result of the}} Montreal Protocol, since they were potent greenhouse gases in addition to their ozone-depleting properties. Spurious differences in observed warming rates may also arise from the mathematics of trend analysis itself, particularly when <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>period</b> is brief and regression assumptions are violated.|$|E
25|$|In New South Wales, Australia, a {{study of}} equestrians seen at one {{hospital}} over a 6-year period found that 81% were wearing a helmet {{at the time of}} injury, and that helmet use both increased over time and was correlated with a lower rate of admission.

25|$|A 2005 {{study in}} the British Medical Journal found that {{learning}} and practising the didgeridoo helped reduce snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by strengthening muscles in the upper airway, thus reducing their tendency to collapse during sleep. In the study, intervention subjects were trained in and practiced didgeridoo playing, including circular breathing and other techniques. Control subjects were asked not to play the instrument. Subjects were surveyed before and after <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>period</b> to assess the effects of intervention.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the capacity and willingness of French-speaking patients to designate a surrogate within 24 h of their ICU admission.

25|$|Analysis {{of catch}} returns from 1969 to 1985, {{showed that the}} fish caught most often by anglers were barbel, bream, bleak, carp, chub, dace, eel, gudgeon, perch, and roach. Over <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>period</b> the returns {{revealed}} {{that there was a}} variation in the species caught, with a shift from roach and dace based catches, to one of chub and bream, a change that was perceived by anglers to represent a ‘serious detriment’ to the fishery. This led to comments that the river had become ‘too clean for its fish’, and its popularity, especially for match fishing, declined from the mid 1980s. Competition from other fisheries such as well stocked ponds and lakes with better amenities and more consistent catches of fish also meant a reduction in the appeal of fishing the Trent.|$|E
25|$|Cecil was {{the best-known}} {{animal in the}} {{national}} park and was identifiable by his black-fringed mane and a GPS tracking collar.
