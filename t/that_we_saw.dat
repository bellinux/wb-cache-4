It was initially estimated that we had killed five and injured seventeen, but we only counted the bodies <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> drop in front of us.|$|E
25|$|At 7 in {{the evening}} of November 28 {{occurred}} a new paroxysm, during which the volcano vomited forth such masses of fire and ejecta that in my opinion, all the material ejected during so many months, if taken together, would not equal the quantity which issued at the time. The columns of fire and smoke ascended higher than ever before, increasing every moment in volume, and setting fire to the whole island, there being not the smallest portion of the latter which was {{not covered by the}} smoke and the glowing rocks and ashes. All this was accompanied by terrific lightning and thunder above, and violent shocks of earthquakes underneath. The cloud of ejecta, carried on by the wind, extended itself toward west and south with the result <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> already some stones fall close to our shore. I, therefore, shouted to all those who were still in the town to take to flight and we all ran off in a hurry; otherwise we would have been engulfed on the spot; as the waves of the angry lake began already to flood the houses nearest to the beach.|$|E
500|$|When Geisel {{returned}} to Springfield in 1986 {{as part of}} a publicity tour he was greeted by dozens of children on Mulberry Street. Another group of children held up a banner that read, [...] "And to think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> him on Mulberry Street". John Fogerty, frontman for the Creedence Clearwater Revival, has stated that the band's song [...] "Lookin' Out My Back Door" [...] was partly inspired by the book.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Walter goes through much development {{during the first}} season. Stuart believed that he changes {{the most out of}} the main cast, and his return to St. Claire's reflects this progression. Actor John Noble explained his character's evolution in a November 2008 interview, [...] "We see Walter from a different angle, very vulnerable. He goes back to the asylum again, and we see the very, very fearful man return for a while. Although he does have some wonderful moments earlier in the episode, when he goes back inside he turns into this incredibly fearful, stuttering fellow <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> when we first met him. It's a very interesting journey we see Walter go through." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{newspaper}} {{described the}} report as {{a blueprint for}} the restoration of [...] "decency and justice into jails where conditions had become intolerable". Home Secretary Kenneth Baker welcomed the Woolf Report and pledged to end [...] "slopping out" [...] by 1994, and also accepted Woolf's recommendations for more visits, home leave and telephone calls. In contrast to his proposed reforms, Baker also proposed the introduction of a new offence of [...] "prison mutiny" [...] carrying a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment, stating [...] "The events of last April marked a watershed in the history of prison service. We cannot, and will not, tolerate the savagery and vandalism in our prisons <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> then".|$|E
500|$|Thomas {{described}} Amanda Seyfried, who {{portrayed the}} murdered Lilly Kane, as [...] "the biggest {{surprise of the}} year". When casting a series regular, {{he was able to}} see all the best actors in town, mainly because they all wanted to be a series regular. When casting Lilly Kane, who would only appear from time-to-time as [...] "the dead girl", Thomas did not receive the same standard of actors. Thomas said that he had [...] "never had a more cut and dry audition" [...] than he did with Seyfried. He said that she was [...] "about 100 times better than anyone else <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw,</b> she was just spectacular". He continued by saying that she ended up being so good in the series that he used her three or four more times than he initially planned.|$|E

500|$|Although Mitchell's defense {{attorney}} argued that Jones' injuries were inconsistent with {{those found in}} Manson's paintings, Lord Nimmo Smith said during sentencing that he did [...] "not feel able {{to ignore the fact}} that there was a degree of resemblance between the injuries inflicted on Jodi and those shown in the Marilyn Manson paintings of Elizabeth Short <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw.</b> I think that you carried an image of the paintings in your memory when you killed Jodi." [...] Mitchell was found guilty of murder and sentenced to serve a minimum of twenty years in prison. Manson later dismissed claims that his work inspired the murder, arguing instead that [...] "the education that parents give their children and the influences they receive" [...] plays a more direct role in violent behavior, and criticised media who attempted to [...] " [...] the blame elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{protagonist of}} the prior film, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), was killed {{off-screen}} in the film. Rumors indicated that Sawa had a contract dispute with New Line concerning the deduction of his salary; however, Perry resolved {{the issue with}} the statement that [...] "it had everything to do with narrative, and nothing to do with money or Devon’s unwillingness to come back." [...] Despite this, New Line reinstated Ali Larter to reprise her character as Clear Rivers. [...] "When New Line asked me to come back, I thought it was great. They showed me the script and let me have some input, and it was really terrific," [...] Larter revealed. Larter indicated that Clear [...] " [...] gotten to a hardened place and tucked herself inside because she has felt so much pain in her life. By having herself committed to a mental hospital, she has created a safehouse so that Death can't get her." [...] Tony Todd also resumed his character as mortician William Bludworth. [...] "It’s the same character <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> before that the audience loved," [...] Ellis expressed.|$|E
500|$|In February 2012, Anthony and Tyler get {{involved}} with criminal Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Of this storyline Lapinksas said, [...] "I loved the challenge. Every time you get a big storyline and lots of scripts, it's fantastic– there's lots to sink your teeth into. Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing {{how we were going}} to perform them. It's like taking on a new project, so every time I get a new storyline, I'm hands-on and ready to go for it." [...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours! Anthony was really worried as he didn't want them to get into trouble, so as we saw, he was trying his best {{to get them out of}} it. But even though they were scared of Derek, Anthony and Tyler are brothers and they've got each other's backs, so it was nice <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> them standing up to Derek in some of the scenes." ...|$|E

500|$|Dan Casey {{writing for}} Nerdist felt the episode was [...] "the most dramatic, tense hour of {{television}} we’ve seen from" [...] the series, stating that [...] "One of the show’s biggest problems {{has been its}} general lack of depth, particularly {{in terms of the}} characters and making them feel like real people rather than glossy superspies with a seemingly endless wellspring of one-liners" [...] and decided that the episode [...] "made significant steps towards fixing this problem, thanks to some wonderful character interactions and an exploration of Fitz/Simmons’ past". James Hunt of Den of Geek said [...] "whether this episode continues the show's upwards trend, that's debatable. It could've been worse, but there wasn't the leap forward <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> from episode three to four, or four to five. I'll say this for an episode: it was better than I thought a Fitz & Simmons episode would be. That's progress, of a sort." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., criticized the scope and scale of the episode, but praised the character development for Coulson, feeling it brought his character closer to the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents of the comics.|$|E
500|$|Director Jennifer Lee {{strongly}} {{believed that}} there couldn't be any other Anna but Kristen Bell, saying, [...] "It was definitely a wonderful surprise hearing her voice , not knowing {{that she had been}} classically trained. Also, she had such a warm, sweet voice. She was everything that we could've hoped for Anna." [...] Co-director Chris Buck shared Lee's ideas, commenting, [...] "Kristen Bell for Anna was the very first person <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw.</b> We did a lot of casting to find Anna, but she just hit it out of the park. From the beginning we loved her, and she just kind of became Anna and Anna became her. I don't know which one is which." [...] Idina Menzel was also surprised by her co-star's singing ability, stating that, [...] "I didn't know how great a singer she was. I quickly found out and need to constantly tell her because she doesn't tell anybody else! She's always playing it down." [...] Songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez later commended Bell's quick comprehension of her ideas, saying that she would collaborate with the actress for [...] "the rest of [...] life" [...] if she could. Anna's animator Becky Bresee commented that Bell's voice [...] "lends itself well, so you are taking bits and pieces." ...|$|E
500|$|Percy Daggs III {{auditioned for}} the role of Wallace Fennel twice before being cast, and he had to go through three tests with the studio and network executives. During his first audition, Daggs read four scenes from the pilot. Before his studio test, Daggs read with Bell and had [...] "a great conversation". He said that she [...] "made me feel {{comfortable}} about auditioning" [...] and was a big reason why he became more comfortable playing Wallace as the season went on. Thomas described Amanda Seyfried, who portrayed the murdered Lilly Kane, as [...] "the biggest surprise of the year".

500|$|The New Zealand {{visual effects}} studio Weta Digital was {{initially}} selected {{to assist in}} creating a preview clip for the 2007 Comic-Con Convention. The studio's 100 employees later developed the visual effects for 300 of the 600 shots in the film. In total, {{there are more than}} 100 jumps in the film, and each jump was modified based on the distance and location the character(s) jumped. The jumps were developed using Nuke and Shake software; many, including those to Big Ben and the Sphinx were created with Maya. Weta's VFX supervisor Erik Winquist explained how the visual effects of the jumps were created: [...] "The concept of what a jump looks like changed and evolved a little over the course of post production. There are shots in the film that use still array footage but not in the same way <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> in The Matrix. The Matrix was largely about stopping time whereas this was about using slow shutter speeds on those still array cameras to end up with a streaky motion-blurred image as the perspective was changing, which is a pretty interesting look." [...] Other visual effects studios that assisted with the film include Hydraulx, Digital Domain, and Pixel Magic. Lightwave 3D was also used for some of the movie's scenes.|$|E
500|$|The {{occupation}} of Serbia by the Central Powers pained Bojić {{far more than}} the everyday struggles of the exodus itself. He is said to have slept very little, telling Živadinović: [...] "You don't realize what you are missing by sleeping. In circumstances like these, the entire soul must be kept constantly awake. Whole centuries have never painted such a vast fresco. Never has death been so greedy, nor heroes so indifferent to it." [...] In December 1915, Bojić reached Shëngjin with the others and reunited with his fiancée. Živadinović recalled: [...] "I shall never forget the day <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> the sea. Only then did Bojić begin to speak about the future. He was making plans for a vast novel in verse, for comedies, dramas, tragedies, all intended to bring the great events of our history back to life." [...] Upon reaching the coast, Bojić was told that he could not board the ship to Italy because he was of fighting age. His fiancée was allowed to board and his fifteen-year-old brother was judged to be too young for military service and granted passage as well. Unable to go with them, Bojić and his companions continued {{down the length of the}} Albanian coast until they reached Corfu, where the Allies had sent ships to transport the remnants of the Serbian Army to the Greek mainland.|$|E
500|$|In October 2011, Marvel Studios held a {{presentation}} at the New York Comic Con that featured new footage and a panel discussion including producer Kevin Feige and several cast members. The first full-length trailer was also released in October. Comic Book Resources said, [...] "The two-minute teaser handily establishes the movie's premise" [...] and is [...] "heavy on the assembling, but fans are also treated to plenty of action, as well glimpses [...] of Iron Man's new armor and, best of all, the new take on the Incredible Hulk. Naturally, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark gets the best lines". However, The Hollywood Reporter called it, [...] "Awesome. Or {{it would be if}} we hadn't seen all of this before and expected every single thing <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> in the trailer". The trailer, which debuted exclusively on iTunes Movie Trailers, was downloaded over 10million times in its first 24 hours, breaking the website's record for the most-viewed trailer. This record was surpassed by the trailer for The Dark Knight Rises, which was downloaded more than 12.5million times in its first 24 hours. The trailer received 20.4 million views in the 24 hours after it debuted. A second full-length trailer was released on iTunes in February 2012, reaching a record 13.7million downloads in 24 hours. The theatrical trailers of The Avengers appeared with many films, including , 21 Jump Street and The Hunger Games.|$|E
