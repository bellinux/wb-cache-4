5|$|M. inclemens {{is one of}} the 11 {{species in}} genus Maevia. The species was first called Attus inclemens, and other names have been used. The two male forms look and behave so {{differently}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> considered two distinct species. In 1955 Robert Barnes chose M. inclemens, and this has become the standard name.|$|E
5|$|The first Winter Games {{were held}} in 1924, in Chamonix, France. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> called International Winter Sports Week and held in {{association}} with the 1924 Summer Olympics, but were in retrospect designated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the IOlympic Winter Games.|$|E

5|$|Auxiliary regiments {{were often}} {{stationed}} in provinces {{other than that}} in which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> raised, for reasons of security and to foster the process of Romanisation in the provinces. The regimental names of many auxiliary units persisted into the 4th century, but by then the units in question were different in size, structure, and quality from their predecessors.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the Heian {{and into}} the Kamakura period, hyōgo-gusari were fashionable {{mountings}} for tachi. Along the edge of both the scabbard and the hilt they were decorated with a long ornamental border. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> designed for use in battle and worn by high-ranking generals together with armour; but in the Kamakura period they were made due to their gorgeous appearance exclusively for the dedication at temples and Shinto shrines. The corresponding blades from that time are unusable.|$|E
5|$|Petty Officers {{have been}} an {{important}} part of the U.S. Navy since its beginning. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> appointed by the ship's captain and usually held such appointments while serving under the captain who selected them. The Petty Officers of this time did not have uniforms or a rank insignia. In 1841 a rate badge was assigned, consisting of a sleeve device displaying an eagle perched on an anchor. Rating marks did not appear until 1866.|$|E

5|$|Rat urine also {{contains}} homologous urinary proteins; although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> given a different name, α2u-globulins, {{they have since}} become known as rat Mups. Rats have 9 distinct Mup genes and a further 13 pseudogenes clustered together across 1.1 megabases of DNA on chromosome 5. Like in mice, the cluster formed by multiple duplications. However, this occurred independently of the duplications in mice, meaning that both rodent species expanded their Mup gene families separately, but in parallel.|$|E
5|$|The 2610 Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps {{is based}} in Sheet Harbour. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> formed on 1 October 1957, but were disbanded on 31 December 1973.

5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog was {{developed}} {{for its ability to}} encourage reluctant cattle to travel long distances and may be the best breed in the world for this work. However, some working dog trainers have expressed concern that dogs bred for the show ring are increasingly too short in the legs and too stocky in the body to undertake the work for which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> bred.|$|E

5|$|The Field Spaniel is a {{medium-sized}} breed dog of the spaniel type. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> developed to be all-black show {{dogs in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries and were unpopular for work as a hunting dog. However, during the mid-20th century they were redeveloped as a longer-legged dog that was more suitable {{to be used for}} field work. They are now considered to be a rare breed, and are registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} records surrounding {{development of}} the Standard Schnauzer in Germany come from the late 19th century. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> bred to be medium-sized farm dogs in Germany, equally suited to ratting, herding, and guarding property. As time passed, farmers bred the Standard Schnauzer into a smaller, more compact size for ratting by combining it with the Affenpinscher and Miniature Poodle. The first recorded Miniature Schnauzer appeared in 1888, and the first exhibition was held in 1899.|$|E
5|$|The first scenes {{depicting}} Tyrion descending with Bronn {{from the}} Mountains of the Moon and encountering the clansmen were not written by Martin. Since <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> {{intended to be}} part of episode seven, they were written by that episode's authors, David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. As often happens in TV production, the scene was moved from one episode to another during editing.|$|E

The thirteen became popular heroes in Bahrain, and analysts speculated {{that the government was}} concerned that their release might re-energize the protest movement and frustrate government supporters who oppose any royal pardons.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} will battle against members of Team Rocket, a {{criminal}} organization originally from Kanto. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> {{defeated by the}} protagonist of FireRed and LeafGreen, and have attempted to come back as an organization, while awaiting the return of their leader, Giovanni. To attempt to contact him, they take over the radio tower and broadcast a message calling out to him.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most Dominican folk songs, children's {{songs and}} musical games are mostly in English. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> {{in the same}} Creole {{as the rest of}} the island, but have come to be {{primarily}} of English, Scottish, and Irish derivation. Children's musical traditions include ring games and circle dances, and music accompanied by thigh-slapping and circle dancing.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>originally</b> from Indiana, but {{now live}} in Atlanta, Georgia. Growing up in the 1980s, the Brothers Chaps were {{creating}} comic books, filming Super 8 movies and eventually toying with a video camera.|$|R
5000|$|It <b>is</b> unclear when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> built, {{and were}} {{estimated}} {{to range from}} mid 7th century to end of 8th century CE; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the oldest known standing stone structures in Central Java.

50|$|Tumbahangphe {{belong to}} the Limbu Indigenous Peoples of Eastern Nepal. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>originally</b> from Tehrathum District. The major {{settlement}} of Tumbahangphe are in the hills, in places like Myanglung (headquarter of Tehrathum district), Taplejung, Dhankuta, Panchthar and Illam.|$|R
5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E
5|$|All the Kimberella fossils {{found so}} far are {{assigned}} to one species, K. quadrata. The first specimens were discovered in Australia in 1959. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> classified as jellyfish by Martin Glaessner and Mary Wade in 1966, and then as box jellyfish by Wade in 1972, a view that remained popular until the fossils of the White sea region were discovered; these prompted a reinterpretation. Research on these specimens by Mikhail A. Fedonkin, initially with Benjamin M. Waggoner in 1997, led to Kimberella being recognised as the oldest well-documented triploblastic bilaterian organism — not a jellyfish at all.|$|E
5|$|Allocators {{were invented}} by Alexander Stepanov {{as part of}} the Standard Template Library (STL). <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> {{intended}} as a means to make the library more flexible and independent of the underlying memory model, allowing programmers to utilize custom pointer and reference types with the library. However, in the process of adopting STL into the C++ standard, the C++ standardization committee realized that a complete abstraction of the memory model would incur unacceptable performance penalties. To remedy this, the requirements of allocators were made more restrictive. As a result, the level of customization provided by allocators is more limited than was originally envisioned by Stepanov.|$|E
5000|$|The artist himself {{refers to}} these works as videos rather than GIF {{animations}} [...] "because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>originally</b> video works exhibited in video format …," [...] explaining, [...] "There's no difference {{other than the}} size of the video." ...|$|R
