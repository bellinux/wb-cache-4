On 12th, the prime minister closed the port of Sihanoukville to the North Vietnamese and issued an impossible ultimatum <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> <b>All</b> PAVN/Viet Cong forces were to withdraw from Cambodian soil within 72 hours (on 15 March) or face military action.|$|E

The temenos extended for some 240metres northeast from the Temple of Amphiaraos (hence Amphiareion) along a streambed. The cult, which was both public and private, dates to the 5th century BCE. There was an upswing in the sanctuary’s reputation as a healing site during the plague that hit Athens in the late 5th BCE Herodotus relates that the oracular response of this shrine was one of only two correct answers to the test put <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> by the Lydian king Croesus.

Bush made it a priority to remove him, regarding him as a scientific fraud, and one of his first acts was to ask for a review of Laughlin's work. In June 1938, Bush asked Laughlin to retire, offering him an annuity, which Laughlin reluctantly accepted. The Eugenics Record Office was renamed the Genetics Record Office, its funding was drastically cut, and it was closed completely in 1944. Senator Robert Reynolds attempted to get Laughlin reinstated, but Bush informed the trustees that an inquiry into Laughlin would [...] "show him to be physically incapable of directing an office, and an investigation of his scientific standing would be equally conclusive." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{producing}} the third series, {{the goal was}} to [...] "raise the bar" [...] higher to satisfy and surprise the audience. The second series finale [...] "Smoke and Mirrors" [...] ended on a cliffhanger which left Tom's fate open. The producers were unsure whether Macfadyen would return at the time they began storylining. Brenton had already written the first two episodes as if he was not coming back. When Macfadyen announced his return for those episodes, they had to be rewritten. Brenton went through a [...] "nightmare" [...] rewriting the first episode as he [...] "dug this enormous hole, and [...] {{had no idea how to}} get out of it." [...] It became a long process of growing the story where Tom turns the tables against Joyce. To make a suitable send off to the character, Brenton did not want Tom to be disillusioned; instead he wanted him to [...] "sort of [...] a human being," [...] as there have been real life instances where spies are attracted to the idea that [...] "the world's a stage <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> the time," [...] but later on they start to unravel.|$|E

[...] The Washington Post {{editorial board}} hailed the sentence, writing that Hastert's victims [...] "should not have had to struggle with what Mr. Hastert did <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> the while they watched him rise in stature and power." [...] The Post called for extending statutes of limitations in sex-abuse cases to give victims more time to come forward and prosecutors more time to pursue perpetrators. New York Times columnist Frank Bruni wrote that Hastert's case underscored the danger that comes with the [...] "quickness and frequency with which so many of us equate displays of religious devotion with actual rectitude," [...] noting that Hastert's public displays of Christian faith during his time in office were [...] "a factor in his colleagues' assessments of him as safe, uncontroversial."

[...] However, it hinted at what the band was preparing for their 2005 full-length, The Forsaken.

500|$|Lamashtu is a {{historically}} older image that left {{a mark on}} the figure of Lilith. Many incantations invoke her as a malicious [...] "Daughter of Heaven" [...] or of Anu, and she is often depicted as a terrifying blood-sucking creature with a lion's head and {{the body of a}} donkey. Akin to Lilitu, Lamashtu primarily preyed on newborns and their mothers. She was said to watch pregnant women vigilantly, particularly when they went into labor. Afterwards, she would snatch the newborn from the mother to drink its blood and eat its flesh. In the Labartu texts she is described; [...] "Wherever she comes, wherever she appears, she brings evil and destruction. Men, beasts, trees, rivers, roads, buildings, she brings harm <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>all.</b> A flesh-eating, bloodsucking monster is she." [...] Gallu was a demon closely associated with Lilith, though the word (like [...] "Utukku") is also used as a general term for demons, and these are [...] "evil Uttuke" [...] or [...] "evil Galli". One incantation tells of them as spirits that threaten every house, rage at people, eat their flesh, and as they let their blood flow like rain, they never stop drinking blood. Lamashtu, Lilitu, and Gallu are invoked in different amulet texts, with Gallu showing up in Graeco-Byzantine myth as Gello, Gylo, or Gyllo. There she appears as a child-stealing and child-killing female demon, in the manner of Lamia and Lilith.|$|E
500|$|Three {{years after}} the , {{detailed}} in Path of Radiance, Daein, the war's instigator and eventual loser, and the victorious nation Crimea {{are still in the}} process of rebuilding. Although Crimea is ruled by Queen Elincia, Daein lacks a proper successor and is instead ruled by the occupation forces of the Begnion Empire. The Daein people are oppressed by the corrupt Begnion senate and imperial soldiers. A group of Daein rebels named the Dawn Brigade, headed by Micaiah (a young woman with a small degree of clairvoyance) and Sothe, act as vigilantes to provide some measure of hope against the oppressors. After being driven from the capital, the Dawn Brigade flees into the northern desert. There they encounter the heron prince Rafiel (who was long presumed dead) and the wolf laguz queen Nailah, whose people have not been seen in Tellius for millennia. Soon after, the Dawn Brigade locates and allies with the late King Ashnard's orphan son Pelleas, his scheming and ruthless adviser Izuka, and the former general (and antagonist in Path of Radiance) of Daein known as the Black Knight. The group launches a guerrilla war against the occupation army, liberating former soldiers of Daein from prison camps and gaining the loyalty of the people. Micaiah's efforts become legendary during these campaigns, with the people of Daein dubbing her the [...] "Silver-Haired Maiden." [...] Word of the plight of the Daein people eventually reaches Empress Sanaki of Begnion. She orders an emissary be sent to Daein to reign in the occupation army. The senate disavows and scapegoats occupation leader General Jarod, who is overthrown and killed by the liberation army in an assault on the capital. Unbeknownst <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>all,</b> Izuka tricks Pelleas into signing a contract known as a blood pact with the head of the Begnion senate, Lekain, which will kill increasingly large numbers of Daein citizens when triggered.|$|E
