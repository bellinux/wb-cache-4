5|$|In {{the medieval}} period, Hale Barns was an {{outlying}} {{area of the}} township of Hale, but a growth in prosperity led to it becoming a separate settlement. The village gets {{its name from the}} tithe barn that used <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there.</b> Before the industrial revolution, Hale Barns was an agricultural village, but since then evolved into a commuter settlement. St Ambrose College Roman Catholic boys' grammar school is in Hale Barns and the village is also home to Ringway golf club. Cotteril Clough in Hale Barns is an ancient and diverse woodland and a Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool had the {{majority}} of the possession up to this point, with Dortmund content to counter-attack. The tactic worked as Dortmund took lead in the 61st minute. Sigfried Held passed to Lothar Emmerich on the left hand side of the pitch, Emmerich played a lofted pass to Held, who volleyed the ball into the goal to give Dortmund a 1–0 lead. Seven minutes later Liverpool were level. Peter Thompson ran down the left hand side of the pitch and passed to Roger Hunt who scored to level the match at 1–1. The linesman on the left hand side of the pitch signalled to the referee that the ball had gone out of play, yet the referee ignored him and allowed the goal <b>to</b> <b>stand.</b> <b>There</b> were few chances for either side {{until the end of the}} half when Liverpool had a chance to win the match, but Hunt's shot missed. With the scores still level at 1–1, the match went into extra-time.|$|E
25|$|Olympia {{was also}} known for the {{gigantic}} ivory and gold statue of Zeus that used <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there,</b> sculpted by Pheidias, which was {{named one of the}} Seven Wonders of the Ancient World by Antipater of Sidon. Very close to the Temple of Zeus which housed this statue, the studio of Pheidias was excavated in the 1950s. Evidence found there, such as sculptor's tools, corroborates this opinion. The ancient ruins sit north of the Alpheios River and south of Mount Kronos (named after the Greek deity Kronos). The Kladeos, a tributary of the Alpheios, flows around the area.|$|E

25|$|Osborne {{was elected}} as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tatton, Cheshire, at the June 2001 election.

Osborne won with a majority of 8,611 over the Labour candidate, becoming (at that time) the youngest Conservative MP in the House of Commons. At the 2005 election he was re-elected with an increased majority of 11,731 (securing 51.8% of the vote), and in 2010 increased his majority still further to 14,487.|$|E
25|$|On October 10, 2001, boxing trainer Eddie Futch {{died at age}} 90. Tim Smith of the New York Daily News remembered an {{encounter}} with the trainer in an article. One of the last times I saw Futch was before the Floyd Mayweather Jr.–Diego Corrales junior lightweight title bout in Vegas. Futch {{was talking about how}} much he admired Mayweather's style, how Mayweather was such a beautiful boxer, able to slip along the ropes and avoid punches. Corrales {{said he was going to}} neutralize Mayweather's hand speed by hitting Mayweather on the arms. 'I guess he thinks he's going <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> and let him hit him on the arms all night,' said Futch, who correctly predicted that Mayweather would completely dismantle Corrales in a defensive masterpiece. Futch had a way of cutting to the heart of a matter. I don't know anyone in boxing who won't miss him. I don't know anyone in boxing that can take his place.|$|E
500|$|The {{custom of}} {{standing}} for the [...] "Hallelujah" [...] chorus originates from a belief that, at the London premiere, King George II did so, {{which would have}} obliged all <b>to</b> <b>stand.</b> <b>There</b> is no convincing evidence that the king was present, or that he attended any subsequent performance of Messiah; the first reference {{to the practice of}} standing appears in a letter dated 1756, three years prior to Handel's death.|$|E

Boulter portrayed a character named [...] "Sean" [...] in Donkey Punch, who tags along with character [...] "Josh" [...] as the [...] "quiet brother ... who hits {{it off with}} Tammi". Boulter guest starred on a two-part episode arc [...] "Wounds" [...] in May 2008 of the television series Waking the Dead as character [...] "Jimmy Dearden". He appeared on the television series Survivors as [...] "Neil" [...] in November 2008. He had a recurring role in ten episodes of the television series Casualty in 2010, as [...] "Kieron Fletcher". He portrayed an emergency physician applying for a medical fellowship. He commented on the inherent difficulties in portraying a physician on television: [...] "Playing a doctor is a strange experience. Pretending you know what you're talking about when you don't is very bizarre but there are advisers on set who are fantastic at taking you through procedures and giving you the confidence <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> and look like you know what you're doing." [...] Boulter starred in the 2011 film Mercenaries directed by Paris Leonti.|$|E
500|$|Sinatra became {{increasingly}} {{frustrated with the}} status of the Harry James band, feeling that he was not achieving the major success and acclaim he was looking for. His pianist and close friend Hank Sanicola persuaded him to stay with the group, but in November 1939 he left James to replace Jack Leonard as the lead singer of the Tommy Dorsey band. Sinatra signed a contract with Dorsey for $125 a week at Palmer House in Chicago, and James agreed amicably to release Sinatra from his contract. On January 26, 1940, he made his first public appearance with the band at the Coronado Theatre in Rockford, Illinois, opening the show with [...] "Stardust". Dorsey recalled: [...] "You could almost feel the excitement coming up out of the crowds when the kid stood up to sing. Remember, he was no matinée idol. He was just a skinny kid with big ears. I used <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> so amazed I'd almost forget to take my own solos". Dorsey was a major influence on Sinatra and became a father figure. Sinatra copied Dorsey's mannerisms and traits, becoming a demanding perfectionist like him, even adopting his hobby of toy trains. He asked Dorsey to be godfather to his daughter Nancy in June 1940. Sinatra later said that [...] "The only two people I've ever been afraid of are my mother and Tommy Dorsey". Though Kelley claims that Sinatra and drummer Buddy Rich were bitter rivals, other authors state that they were friends and even roommates when the band was on the road, but professional jealousy surfaced as both men wanted to be considered the star of Dorsey's band. Later, Sinatra helped Rich form his own band with a $25,000 loan and provided financial help to Rich during times of the drummer's serious illness.|$|E
2500|$|McCartney {{has called}} it his {{favorite}} song of all time. In {{an interview with}} David Leaf in 1990 he stated, [...] "I was asked recently to give my top 10 favorite songs for a Japanese radio station ... I didn't think long and hard on it but I popped that [...] {{on the top of}} my list. It's very deep. Very emotional, always a bit of a choker for me, that one." [...] Speaking again in 2007, McCartney said: [...] "'God Only Knows' {{is one of the few}} songs that reduces me to tears every time I hear it. It's really just a love song, but it's brilliantly done. It shows the genius of Brian. I've actually performed it with him and I'm afraid to say that during the sound check I broke down. It was just too much <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> singing this song that does my head in and <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> singing it with Brian." [...] Brian responded apprehensively to McCartney's admiration of the song in the 1970s: [...] "Like, if 'God Only Knows' is the greatest song ever written, then I'll never write anything as good again! And if I never write anything as good, then I'm finished." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Keyes {{had decided}} on {{a course of action}} to dramatize his position. On October 3 he {{cancelled}} his application for conscientious objector status. In December that year he wrote to two local newspapers in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois to announce that he would celebrate Christmas, the time to think about peace on earth, by burning his draft card. He wrote, [...] "As a prayer for peace on earth, I will be holding a vigil on Christmas Eve in front of the local draft board." [...] He proposed <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> for twelve hours starting at noon. [...] "At midnight Christmas Eve I will be using my draft card to light a candle." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{has lived}} in a Turtle Bay, Manhattan brownstone since writing Gypsy in 1959. Ten years later, while he was playing music he heard {{a knock on the}} door. His neighbor, Katharine Hepburn, was in [...] "bare feet – this angry, red-faced lady" [...] and told him [...] "You have been keeping me awake all night!" [...] (she was {{practicing}} for her musical debut in Coco). When Sondheim asked why she had not asked him to play for her, she said she lost his phone number. According to Sondheim, [...] "My guess is that she wanted <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> in her bare feet, suffering for her art".|$|E
2500|$|He {{narrowly}} {{failed to}} win the Wolverhampton East by-election held in 1908 by eight votes. [...] In the Birmingham South by-election of 1911 he was unopposed as a Liberal Unionist Member of Parliament (MP) and he would hold that seat until 1945. One reason that Amery agreed <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> under the Liberal Unionist label (they were to fully merge with the Conservatives the following year) {{was that he had}} been a longtime political admirer of Joseph Chamberlain and was an ardent supporter of tariff reform and imperial federation. According to AJP Taylor, Amery was a rare Conservative to promote only protectionism [...] "as merely the beginning of a planned economy".|$|E

2500|$|The Old-Timer (Bill Thompson) – a hard-of-hearing {{senior citizen}} with {{a penchant for}} {{distorting}} jokes, prefacing each one by saying, [...] "That ain't the way I heer'd it!" [...] For no apparent reason, he refers to Fibber as [...] "Johnny" [...] and Molly as [...] "Daughter". A recurring joke is that he refuses to tell his real name. In the 1940 episode [...] "Mailing Christmas Packages", he is referred to by another character as [...] "Roy", while in one episode (01/29/1946 and reiterated in the episode a week later) he claims his name is [...] "Rupert Blasingame". In the 3/25/41 episode, [...] "Fibber Changes His Name", he appears as Mr. Fumble, a lawyer. Also, in the 3/14/39 episode, Fibber calls him Mr. Sims, but he's having trouble with his memory in this episode, so this may be just an error in remembering, as he also calls Mr. Wilcox [...] "Harpo" [...] for perhaps the first time instead of Harlow, due to poor memory tricks. The Old-Timer's girlfriend is named Bessie, and she usually refers to him as [...] "O.T." [...] In a 15-minute episode {{near the end of the}} series, Mcgee and Molly spend the day trying to find one mysterious [...] "Adleton P. Bagshaw," [...] only to discover him to be the Old-Timer. [...] At the Mcgees' surprise the Old-Timer says, [...] "You mean <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> with your bare face hanging out in the wind and tell me you don't know my name[...] [...] pretty discouragin' when folks you consider your friends for nigh on twenty years don't even know." ...|$|E
2500|$|The deferent-and-epicycle model {{had been}} used by Greek astronomers for centuries along {{with the idea of}} the {{eccentric}} (a deferent which is slightly off-center from the Earth), which was even older. In the illustration, the center of the deferent is not the Earth but the spot marked X, making it eccentric (from the Greek ἐκ ec- meaning [...] "from," [...] and κέντρον kentron meaning [...] "center"), from which the spot takes its name. Unfortunately, the system that was available in Ptolemy's time did not quite match observations, even though it was considerably improved over Hipparchus' system. Most noticeably the size of a planet's retrograde loop (especially that of Mars) would be smaller, and sometimes larger, than expected, resulting in positional errors of as much as 30 degrees. To alleviate the problem, Ptolemy developed the equant. The equant was a point near the center of a planet's orbit which, if you were <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> and watch, the center of the planet's epicycle would always appear to move at uniform speed; all other locations would see non-uniform speed, like on the Earth. By using an equant, Ptolemy claimed to keep motion which was uniform and circular, although it departed from the Platonic ideal of uniform circular motion. [...] The resultant system, which eventually came to be widely accepted in the west, seems unwieldy to modern astronomers; each planet required an epicycle revolving on a deferent, offset by an equant which was different for each planet. It predicted various celestial motions, including {{the beginning and end of}} retrograde motion, to within a maximum error of 10 degrees, considerably better than without the equant.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 February 2015, it was {{revealed}} West had already filmed his final scenes and left the show. Former Fawlty Towers star, Andrew Sachs, was announced to be joining the show on 10 March 2015 as Cyril Bishop, roommate of Stan when he is admitted to hospital. Sachs' first scenes were announced to air on 18 March 2015. Cyril died in the following episode, saddening Stan. Bradshaw-White teased Stan's exit week {{in an interview with}} Inside Soap, saying that Tina would take over Stan's care when Mick and Shirley become too embroiled in arguing to notice the pain he is going through. Discussing Stan's death, Bradshaw-White said, [...] "Stan has another one of his episodes and Tina just falls apart. So {{the rest of the family}} end up sending her home - they think she's not going to be able to cope with him dying. Tina goes back to The Vic thinking that she'll come in and see her dad again in the morning, but then he tragically dies that night." [...] Stan's final scenes aired on 10 April 2015 when after an emotional heart-to-heart with Shirley, he peacefully died in a hospice. Rather than the regular [...] "Doof Doofs" [...] that feature at the end of each episode, Fly Me to the Moon, as sung by Tony Bennett, was played over the credits in tribute to Stan. Following his on-screen exit, West spoke out in support of Prostate Cancer UK and signed up for the Men United campaign, [...] "Stan was probably the archetypal bad patient. He was very slow in thinking about his condition and recognising what it might be. He was slow to seek diagnosis, slow to act on the diagnosis and reluctant to see doctors. He was terrible really, something we should all look at and not do the same. What Men United seeks to do, and it's terribly important, is to hold out a hand to people to say, 'Come on, you will see people here with whom you can swap experiences, swap ideas, swap thoughts, swap feelings'. You don't have <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>there</b> and wait for people to come, because they won't. You just need a little push and you will like it when you get there." ...|$|E
