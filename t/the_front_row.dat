5|$|Schumacher {{was again}} partnered by Rosberg at Mercedes for the 2012 season. Schumacher {{retired from the}} inaugural race of the season , and scored {{a point in the}} second race in Malaysia. In China Schumacher started on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row</b> {{alongside}} Rosberg on pole, but retired due to a loose wheel after a mechanics error during a pit stop.|$|E

50|$|Law 20.1 (g) Forming a scrum: The referee {{will call}} “crouch” and then “bind”. In the “crouch” {{position}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> will be {{shoulder to shoulder}} with their opponents, stable and supporting their own weight without pushing. On the “bind” call the props will position their arms in the correct ‘bind’ position current Law 20.1 (g) outlines the correct bind. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> (+ back 5 players) will tighten binds and set themselves for the throw-in. The ball is then thrown-in without delay as per Law 20.5.|$|R

The audience saw Fox step out of character - that of French statesman Charles de Gaulle - and chastise the heckler with robust language.|$|E
5|$|Members {{are able}} to sit {{anywhere}} in the debating chamber, but typically sit in their party groupings. The First Minister, Scottish cabinet ministers and Law officers sit in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row,</b> in the middle section of the chamber.

The Presiding Officer, parliamentary clerks and officials sit opposite members at the front of the debating chamber.|$|E
5|$|Veteran West Virginia Senator Harley M. Kilgore {{offered to}} {{exchange}} seats with Barkley, putting Barkley on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row</b> with the chamber's senior members and {{himself on the}} back row with the freshman legislators, but Barkley declined the offer. In honor of his previous service, {{he was assigned to}} the prestigious Committee on Foreign Relations. In this position, he endorsed Eisenhower's appointment of Cooper as U.S. Ambassador to India and Nepal. His relative lack of seniority did not afford him much influence.|$|E

2500|$|To form a scrum the two forward packs {{approach}} to within an arms length of each other. The referee gives the command crouch and <b>the</b> opposing <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> then crouch {{so that their}} backs are {{parallel to the ground}} and their head and shoulders are no lower than their hips. Then the referee calls bind and [...] "using their outside arm each prop binds onto the point of the opposing prop’s outside shoulder." [...] This command is to ensure that <b>the</b> two <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> are not too far apart. Finally the referee then says set (this is not a command, but rather permission to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> to engage) and <b>the</b> two <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> come together. When this happens both <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> thrust forward with the tighthead props heads going between the opposing hooker and loosehead prop. The props then bind by gripping the back or side of the opposing prop's jersey.|$|R

5|$|Webber was {{retained}} by Red Bull Racing for 2013, {{which was to}} be his last season with the team. At the opening leg in Australia, he qualified on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row</b> but only managed a sixth-place finish in the race. Tensions between himself and teammate Vettel rose after the German overtook Webber in the closing stages of the Malaysian Grand Prix to take the win despite the team's order to hold positions. Webber took another podium in Monaco.|$|E
5|$|While the {{surgeons}} {{working on the}} body are observed by the mortar-boarded academics in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row,</b> the physicians, who can be identified by their wigs and canes, largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves.

5|$|Forty-four {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only forty-three raced because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Edwards clinched his eighth pole position during his career, {{with a time}} of 26.224 seconds, which was a new track record. He was joined on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row</b> of the grid by Kurt Busch. Kahne qualified third, Kyle Busch took fourth, and Smith started fifth. Joey Logano, Martin Truex, Jr., McMurray, Keselowski, and Biffle rounded out the first ten positions. The driver who failed to qualify for the race was Brian Keselowski, who had a time of 27.431 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Häkkinen {{started the}} race {{alongside}} Michael Schumacher on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row</b> of the grid. Michael Schumacher attempted {{to defend his}} lead off the line by moving into Häkkinen's path, but Häkkinen passed Michael Schumacher heading into the first corner, with Coulthard withstanding Williams driver Ralf Schumacher attempts to pass him to maintain third position. Michael Schumacher managed {{to close the gap}} to his title rival by lap 31 and passed Häkkinen during the second round of pit stops. This allowed him to maintain a 1.9-second gap between himself and Häkkinen {{towards the end of the}} race to secure his eighth victory of the season.|$|E
5|$|In early 1955 Hordern {{was asked}} by the British theatre manager and {{producer}} Binkie Beaumont {{to take the lead in}} André Roussin's comedy Nina, directed by Rex Harrison. The play, which starred Edith Evans, Lockwood West, and James Hayter, transferred from Oxford to the Theatre Royal in Brighton. Beaumont's request came at short notice because Hordern's predecessor had proved inadequate. The play was cursed with bad luck: Evans fell ill and was replaced midway by an understudy who neglected to learn her lines; Harrison frequently upset the cast, which resulted in reduced morale. When Evans did return, she walked off stage and left after seeing empty seats in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row.</b>|$|E
5|$|Michael Schumacher started {{alongside}} Coulthard on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row</b> of the grid. Going {{into the}} first corner, Häkkinen accelerated faster than Michael Schumacher and Coulthard off the line and overtook both drivers for the lead. He managed to maintain his lead until his first pit stop on lap 31. As his teammate Coulthard made his pit stop one lap later, Häkkinen regained the lead which he held to win his third win of the season. Michael Schumacher fended off Coulthard, who challenged him in the later stages despite losing time lapping backmarkers, to take second.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007 the scrum law was {{amended to}} a four-step, [...] "crouch", [...] "touch", [...] "pause", [...] "engage" [...] process {{in an attempt}} to control scrum engagement. Prior to this, there was no {{obligation}} for each prop to touch the opposing props shoulder, and the distance between <b>the</b> two <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> was often larger. The new rule fixed the distance between <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> and as a result cut the force of impact from the engagement. The reason for the rule change was {{to reduce the number of}} serious neck injuries to front rowers.|$|R

5|$|Pearson raced for Hoss Ellington {{during the}} 1980 season. He won the 1980 CRC Chemicals Rebel 500 at Darlington for his final Cup win. He started nine times to finish 37th in season points. Pearson {{qualified}} on the pole position at Charlotte for his eleventh straight {{time and he}} had started on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row</b> in fifteen straight races between 1972–80. In 1981, he raced in six races for four owners. His season was highlighted by winning the pole position for Kennie Childers at Dover and two Top 10 finishes at Darlington.|$|E
5|$|Senna had {{qualified}} on pole position, having not set a {{lap time}} following Ratzenberger's death. He was joined on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row</b> by Schumacher and Berger qualified in 3rd. Damon Hill {{was able to}} improve on his disastrous Friday session before the red flag, improving his time by one second and qualifying fourth as a result. A time posted by Ratzenberger before his fatal crash would have been sufficient for entry into the race starting from the 26th and final position on the grid; Paul Belmondo and Barrichello did not qualify.|$|E
5|$|The two-tier {{steel frame}} and wooden floor Bullens Road Stand, {{designed}} by Archibald Leitch, {{was completed in}} 1926. The upper tier was seated, with terracing below, {{a part of the}} ground called The Paddock. Few changes were made until 1963 when the rear of the Paddock was seated and an overhanging roof was added. The stand is known for Archibald Leitch's highly distinctive balcony trusses which also act as handrails for <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row</b> of seats in the Upper Bullens stand. Goodison Park is the only stadium with two complete trusses designed by Leitch. Of the 17 created, only Goodison Park, Ibrox and Fratton Park retain these trusses.|$|E

5|$|During the session, {{in where}} drivers ran in packs and drafted off each other, Juan Pablo Montoya {{made contact with}} Kahne and sent his car {{spinning}} into the grass on the front stretch, tearing off some of its nose. Kahne was required to use a backup car {{for the rest of}} Speedweeks. Because the qualifying grids were chosen by the order in which drivers qualified in Daytona 500 pole position qualifying, the pole was given to Carl Edwards in the first race and to Biffle in the second. Edwards was joined on the grid's front row by Dale Earnhardt, Jr., with Ambrose in third. Stenhouse and Bayne started in fourth and fifth positions respectively. Biffle was joined by Mears on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row</b> for the second race, with Jeff Gordon in third. Martin Truex, Jr. started fourth, and was followed by Martin in fifth.|$|E
5|$|Growing up {{as part of}} a lucha libre {{family the}} future Espanto Jr. decided he wanted to follow in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather at an early age. In a 2010 interview he recalled how he would be in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row</b> watching his father wrestle from the time he could walk. In 1996 his father suffered an injury during a match and was briefly clinically dead while in the ring until he was revived. While the injury left a big impression on the then-10 year old he later accepted that it was an accident and tried not to think about it, but did comment that his mother still worried about him every time he competed.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 the Williams car {{was clearly}} the quickest in Formula One and Hill {{went on to win}} the title ahead of his rookie {{teammate}} Jacques Villeneuve, becoming the first son of a Formula One champion to win the championship himself. Taking eight wins and never qualifying off <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>row,</b> Hill enjoyed by far his most successful season. At Monaco, where his father had won five times in the 1960s, he led until his engine failed, curtailing his race and allowing Olivier Panis to take his only Formula One win. Near the end of the season, Villeneuve began to mount a title challenge and took pole in the Japanese Grand Prix, the final race of the year. However, Hill took the lead at the start and won both the race and the championship after the Canadian retired.|$|E
