There were {{ducks and geese}} of various kinds, and innumerable quantities of plover, cormorants, gulls, and eider-ducks, the eggs of which they found in thousands. Many of these birds were good for food, and the eggs of most of them, especially those of the eider-duck, were excellent. Reindeer were also met with; and, among other trophies of his skill as a hunter, Frank one day brought in a black bear, parts of which were eaten with great gusto by the Esquimaux and Indians, to the immense disgust of Bryan, who expressed his belief that the [...] "haythens was barely fit to live," [...] and were most justly locked out from society in [...] "thim dissolate polar raygeons." [...] There were many seals, also, in the sea, which put up their ugly, grotesque heads ever and anon, gazed at the canoes with their huge, fishy eyes, as in surprise {{at the sight of}} such novel marine monsters, and then sank slowly beneath the wave. These animals were never molested, out of respect to the feelings of the two Indians, who believed them to be gods, and assured Stanley that the destruction of one would infallibly bring down ill-luck and disaster on the heads of the party. Stanley smiled inwardly at this, but gave orders that no seals should be shot-- an order which all were very willing to obey, as they did not require <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>either</b> for food or any other purpose. Several white polar bears were seen, but they also were spared, as they require a great deal of shot to kill them, if not hit exactly behind the ear; and besides, neither their bodies nor skins were of any use to the travellers.|$|E

40|$|Intraperitoneal {{injection}} of the non-phorbol tumor promoter anthralin (1, 8 -dihydroxy- 9 -anthrone) in male rats {{resulted in an}} increase of hepatic ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity. Maximal activity was observed 8 h after promoter administration reaching levels about 30 times over control. The kinetics of anthralin dependent ODC induction differed markedly from that by either 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) or phenobarbital (PB) (Bisschop et al., Carcinogenesis 2 (1981) 1282). With anthralin a slow decrease of ODC back to control level is observed approximately within 22 h. In contrast, ODC induction mediated by other tumor promoters like TPA and PB decreased to control levels within 4 – 6 hours. Administration of a second dose of anthralin 8 h after the first dose prevented the activity decrease as normally observed after a single dose of a tumor promoter. This effect lasted at least 10 h. ODC activity induction occurred in a dose-dependent manner being linear from 10 – 2000 μg anthralin/kg body wt.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown (M. Aronson, O. Medalia, D. Amichay, and O. Nativ, Infect. Immun. 56 : 1615 - 1617, 1988) that shedding of viable uroepithelial cells (elicited by invading microorganisms) constitutes an antimicrobial defense mechanism. The present study deals with two different stress-involving procedures, in which increased uroepithelial shedding rendered female mice resistant to vesical infection. Moderate stress was induced in female mice by exposing <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>either</b> to constant illumination for 96 h or to 37 degrees C heat for 24 h. In both cases, {{the rate of}} infection was considerably reduced {{as a result of}} increased epithelial shedding (P < 0. 0001). Stress was manifested by both reduced thymic weight and increased blood corticosterone levels. Shedding was also elicited by intraperitoneal injection of norepinephrine together with hydrocortisone or by intravesical injection of corticosterone. Constant illumination as well as heat enormously facilitated the migration of polymorphonuclear cells into the bladder following the action of chemotactic stimuli. Male mice subjected to identical stress-generating conditions did not display considerable epithelial shedding or increased migration of polymorphonuclear cells, and they were not protected from intravesical infection...|$|E

Groups of 12 adult male Wistar rats receiving caffeine (0. 3 - 30 mg/kg, ip, in 0. 1 ml/ 100 g body weight) administered 30 min before training, immediately after training, or 30 min before the test session were tested in the spatial version of the Morris water maze task. Post-training administration of caffeine improved memory retention at the doses of 0. 3 - 10 mg/kg (the rats swam up to 600 cm less to find the platform in the test session, P<= 0. 05) but not at the dose of 30 mg/kg. Pre-test caffeine administration also caused a small increase in memory retrieval (the escape path of the rats was up to 500 cm shorter, P<= 0. 05). In contrast, pre-training caffeine administration did not alter the performance of <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>either</b> in the training or in the test session.

40|$|Intimal {{hyperplasia}} {{remains the}} leading cause of vein graft failure. Various external stenting devices have been shown to reduce the development of intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts. Mitogenic and mechanotransduction signals are known to be mediated by G protein-coupled receptors. Therefore in this study we examined the alterations in G protein expression and receptor coupling in vein grafts stented with external tube support. Thirty New Zealand White male rabbits had a right carotid interposition bypass graft with use of the ipsilateral jugular vein. Fifteen animals received external support and 15 were controls. In a subset <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>either</b> had removal of the external support or a sham-control neck exploration at 14 days after the initial implantation (n = 5 per group). External support reduced G alpha i 3 proteins by 30 % in vein grafts without changes in G alpha s by Western blot. Vein grafts with external support were significantly less sensitive to pertussis toxin inactivation than controls were in response to both norepinephrine and serotonin. A 24 % decrease in intimal thickness was maintained after withdrawal of the initial external support. The placement of an external support is associated with alternations in G protein expression and receptor coupling function in vein grafts. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the development of vein graft intimal hyperplasia may involve G protein-mediated events...|$|E

40|$|In {{the young}} chick, the {{intermediate}} medial hyperstriatum ventrale {{is involved in}} learning paradigms, including imprinting and passive avoidance learning. Biochemical changes in the intermediate medial hyperstriatum ventrale following learning include an up-regulation of amino-acid transmitter levels and receptor activity. To follow the changes of extracellular amino acid levels during passive avoidance training, we used an in vivo microdialysis technique. Probes were implanted in chicks before training <b>the</b> <b>animals,</b> <b>either</b> on a methyl- anthranylate-or water-coated bead. One hour later, recall was tested in both groups by presenting a similar bead. An increase of extra-cellular glutamate levels accompanied training and testing in both groups; during training, glutamate release was higher in methylanthranylate- trained than in water-trained chicks. When compared with the methylanthranylate-trained chicks during testing, the water-trained chicks showed enhanced extra-cellular glutamate levels. No other amino acid examined showed significant changes. After testing, the chicks were anesthetized and release- stimulated with an infusion of 50 mM potassium. Extra-cellular glutamate and taurine levels were significantly increased in both methylanthranylate-and water-trained chicks. The presentation of methylanthranylate as an. olfactory stimulus significantly enhanced glutamate levels, especially in methylanthranylate-trained chicks. The results suggest that such changes in extra-cellular glutamate levels in the intermediate medial hyperstriatum ventrale accompany pecking at either the water- or the methylanthranylate-bead. The taste of the aversant {{may be responsible for}} the greater increases found in methylanthranylate-trained birds...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} for {{the first}} time the occurrence of seasonal variations in the semen of free-ranging rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). During the breeding season, the animals produce semen which is normal in volume, quality, and physical characteristics, and contains a highly uniform population of motile anl structurally normal spermatozoa; during th nnbreeding season, <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>either</b> do not respond to electrostimu!ation, or they produce only minimal volumes of an ejaculate with abnormal physical characteristics, and consisting of a markedly reduced number of spermatozoa which are mostly nonmotile, structurally anomalous, degenerating and/or undergoing massive phagocytosis by macro-phages. Testicular biopsy specimens from the same animals disclose that these semen variations arc accounted for by marked differences in the activity of the seminiferous tubules which show florid spennatogenesis during the breeding season, and nearly complete spermatogenic arrest during the nonbreeding season. The seasonal variations noted in this study correlate well with other anatomical and physiological changes known to occur in these animals in association with their annual reproductive cycle, and provide another element of distinction between free-ranging and laboratory macaques where these seasonal fluctuations are either suppressed or greatly reduced. The sexual and reproductive behavior of free-ranging rhesus monkeys (Macaca niulatta) is characterized by distinct sea-sonal variations, the occurrence and length of which vary, depending upon ecological conditions, and, possibly, behavioral fac-tors.

40|$|The {{superior}} colliculus {{is a major}} brain stem structure {{for the production of}} saccadic eye movements. Electrical stimulation at any given point in the motor map generates saccades of defined amplitude and direction. It is unknown how this saccade map is affected by strabismus. Three macaques were raised with exotropia, an outwards ocular deviation, by detaching the medial rectus tendon in each eye at age 1 mo. The animals were able to make saccades to targets with either eye and appeared to alternate fixation freely. To probe the organization of the {{superior colliculus}}, microstimulation was applied at multiple sites, with <b>the</b> <b>animals</b> <b>either</b> free-viewing or fixating a target. On average, microstimulation drove nearly conjugate saccades, similar in both amplitude and direction but separated by the ocular deviation. Two monkeys showed a pattern deviation, characterized by a systematic change in the relative position of the two eyes with certain changes in gaze angle. These animals' saccades were slightly different for the right eye and left eye in their amplitude or direction. The differences were consistent with the animals' underlying pattern deviation, measured during static fixation and smooth pursuit. The tectal map for saccade generation appears to be normal in strabismus, but saccades may be affected by changes in the strabismic deviation that occur with different gaze angles...|$|E
