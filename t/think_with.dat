500|$|Following {{the failure}} of two of her {{commercial}} releases, Zinta began working with art film directors, and turned towards neo-realistic films, known in India as Parallel Cinema. She acted in her first English film, Rituparno Ghosh's The Last Lear, as a struggling film actress opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, and was received well. Later reviews in India were approving, with Rajeev Masand writing, [...] "Preity Zinta gets through her scenes competently, never allowing her cute-as-a-button image {{to take away from}} the impact she makes here as a conflicted, mature woman." [...] Initially dismissive of art films, Zinta eventually spoke of her first venture into the genre, confessing, [...] "I did <b>think</b> <b>with</b> art films that they don't pay you, they don't feed you, but I was wrong, and I'm so happy to be here." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2012, {{art critic}} Camille Paglia praised {{the film in}} Glittering Images, {{comparing}} some of its scenes to works by modern painters and calling it [...] "the greatest work of art in recent memory". Paglia explained that the film's finale, [...] "has more inherent artistic value, emotional power, and global impact than anything by the artists you name. It's because the art world has flat-lined and become an echo chamber of received opinion and toxic over-praise. It's like the emperor's new clothes -- people are too intimidated to admit what they secretly think or what they might <b>think</b> <b>with</b> their blinders off. Episode III epitomizes the modern digital art movement, more so than other piece from the last 30 years.

500|$|While some {{conflict}} approaches also gained {{popularity in}} the United States, the mainstream of the discipline instead shifted {{to a variety of}} empirically oriented middle-range theories with no single overarching, or [...] "grand", theoretical orientation. John Levi Martin refers to this [...] "golden age of methodological unity and theoretical calm" [...] as the Pax Wisconsana, as it reflected the composition of the sociology department at the University of Wisconsin–Madison: numerous scholars working on separate projects with little contention. Omar Lizardo describes the Pax Wisconsana as: [...] "a Midwestern flavored, Mertonian resolution of the theory/method wars in which [...] all agreed on at least two working hypotheses: (1) grand theory' is a waste of time; (2) [...] good theory has to be good to <b>think</b> <b>with</b> or goes in the trash bin." [...] Despite the aversion to grand theory in the later half of the 20th century, several new traditions have emerged that propose various syntheses: structuralism, post-structuralism, cultural sociology and systems theory.|$|E
500|$|Holmes's fame {{continued}} through his later years. The Poet at the Breakfast-Table {{was published in}} 1872.

[...] Nothing can be so perfect while we possess it as it will seem when remembered". In 1876, {{at the age of}} seventy, Holmes published a biography of John Lothrop Motley, which was an extension of an earlier sketch he had written for the Massachusetts Historical Society Proceedings. The following year he published a collection of his medical essays and Pages from an Old Volume of Life, a collection of various essays he had previously written for The Atlantic Monthly. He retired from Harvard Medical School in 1882 after thirty-five years as a professor. After he gave his final lecture on November 28, the university made him professor emeritus.|$|E

500|$|Central to Colbert's {{personality}} is his rigid belief that [...] "what I say is right, and [...] anyone else says {{could possibly be}} true", regardless of any evidence to the contrary. He discussed this in the Reports first Wørd segment, using the term [...] "truthiness" [...] as he explained what he perceives to {{be the difference between}} [...] "those who <b>think</b> <b>with</b> their head and those who know with their heart". He has further gone on to ascribe [...] "truthiness" [...] to other institutions including Wikipedia, which he believes upholds his view that reality can be determined by consensus opinion, and often encourages viewers to use Wikipedia to [...] "change reality". Colbert believes that if a majority of people want something to be true, that thing therefore must become the truth. For instance, after months of scoffing at global warming, Colbert suddenly reversed his position, conceding its existence only due to the box office success of An Inconvenient Truth, a sign that [...] "the free market has spoken".|$|E

500|$|During {{a series}} of {{interviews}} to promote his film Sing Street in 2016, Carney repeatedly criticized Knightley for her acting in Begin Again. When asked about the critical reaction to Sing Street by The Independent, Carney responded unprompted that [...] "it's a small personal movie with no Keira Knightleys in it. It's really rewarding." [...] In the same interview Carney also referred to her repeatedly as a model, despite the fact that Knightley had been working professionally as an actress since childhood, saying [...] "I'll never make a film with supermodels again." [...] He also criticized her in an interview with Heyuguys.com, saying, [...] "I just <b>think</b> <b>with</b> Keira it was like asking her to do something that she could not do." [...] Though he did not specifically name Knightley, he did, in an interview with Den of Geek, say that his desire to make Sing Street came from his [...] "experience of working, let's face it, with a model on my last film". Filmmakers Massy Tadjedin, Mark Romanek, Lorene Scafaria and Lynn Shelton, who had worked with Knightley on other films, tweeted their support for her after Carney's comments.|$|E

Walt Disney Pictures also pushed for an Academy Award for Best Picture nomination, {{but it was not}} nominated, provoking controversy as to whether the Academy deliberately restricted WALL-E to the Best Animated Feature category. Peter Travers commented that [...] "If there was ever a time where an animated feature deserved to be nominated for best picture it's Wall-E." [...] Only three animated films, 1991's Beauty and the Beast and Pixar's next two films, 2009's Up and 2010's Toy Story 3, have ever been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.

500|$|.....a {{great number}} of citizens, {{in various parts of}} the United States, are preparing, and many have {{actually}} emigrated to this Territory, to get free from a Government which does tolerate slavery ... And although it is contended by some, that, at this day, there is a great majority in favor of slavery, whilst the opposite opinion is held by others, the fact is certainly doubtful. But when we take into consideration the vast emigration into this Territory, and of citizens, too, decidedly opposed to the measure, we feel satisfied that, at all events, Congress will suspend any legislative act on this subject until we shall, by the constitution, be admitted into the Union, and have a right to adopt such a constitution, in this respect, as may comport with the wishes of a majority of the citizens.... The toleration of slavery is either right or wrong; and if Congress should <b>think,</b> <b>with</b> us, that it is wrong, that it is inconsistent with the principles upon which our future constitution is to be formed, your memorialists will rest satisfied that, at least, this subject will not be by them taken up until the constitutional number of the citizens of this Territory shall assume that right.|$|E
500|$|With the {{introduction}} of Jason Wilkes and Frost, both considered [...] "outsiders" [...] as Carter {{was in the first}} season, co-showrunner Chris Dingess noted how their arcs in the season would be similar, yet different to Carter's, saying [...] "I think everyone, to get to that place of getting respect, has a different road to get there. Everyone makes different choices along the way that define that road and I <b>think</b> <b>with</b> these three characters, everyone has a distinct, separate path." [...] Atwell spoke specifically about the season's approach to diversity and prejudice, and noted that the series' crew had expanded to include African American and Asian writers as well as a female director. [...] "Since the first season heavily focused on a woman in a man's world," [...] Atwell said, [...] "we're now going into more diversity and we're investigating different prejudices within this time and one of them absolutely would have been race, as we all know....if you have a staunchly white male cast then it might be more accurate of the time, but it becomes less relatable to our audiences, especially when the Marvel world's so diverse." [...] On the racism issue, Butters stated, [...] "We didn't want to just have an African-American character and not talk about that. That would have been very inauthentic." [...] As for the sexism Frost faces, Gina McIntrye and Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly saw similarities with Marvel's Jessica Jones when Frost is asked to smile by two different men in her flashbacks in [...] "Smoke & Mirrors". Towers said, [...] "The talent agent [...] may not be the Purple Man, but Whitney is certainly being ushered into a brainwashed mindset that will set her on a path she can't deviate from easily." ...|$|E
