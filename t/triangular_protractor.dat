40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of this}} thesis presents the historical beginnings of Euclidean geometry, the concept of Euclidean constructions, and some basic methods of solving construction problems. We also focus on the teaching of geometric constructions in the 7 th grade of elementary school, in particular we present objectives and standards of knowledge {{that relate to the}} teaching of geometric constructions, and we offer a comparative overview of the treatment of Euclidean constructions in two textbooks, one from 1972, and the other from 2003. The main difference between the two textbooks is related to the set of used construction tools and in the way the construction process is documented in the textbook. In the new book almost all constructions are carried out using a <b>triangular</b> <b>protractor</b> and a compass, whereas in the older one the constructions a set square and compass are used. The 2003 textbook explains the subject in more detail and with lots of illustrative examples, so that pupils may be more independent in their study, and also the teacherâ€™s work is facilitated. The core of the empirical part of the thesis consists of a research on the way geometric constructions are treated in Slovenian schools. The participants were 91 mathematics teachers; the data were obtained with a questionnaire. The research points out to two main areas of differences in the way of implementing the construction related part of mathematics curriculum. The first area is the assigned importance of the construction tools and related accuracy in the construction drawing. The second area is the level of the given emphasis to the documentation of the construction steps...|$|E
