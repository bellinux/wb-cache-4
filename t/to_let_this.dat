Liz pretends to be Jenna and discovers that Jenna and Dennis slept together. Liz is determined not <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>this</b> revelation affect her friendship with Jenna, so the two go to confront Dennis about his behavior.

Distraught after realizing that they are having sex and after everyone mocks him, Andy throws a tantrum, hurling a box of pizza at the wall and storming out of the conference room. Gabe takes Andy to his cubicle and admonishes him for his behavior, revealing he is aware why Andy hosted the sex ed class. He explains to Andy that the only reason he asked Erin out was because Andy gave his blessing, which Andy reveals was just a result of his difficulty saying no to how politely Gabe asked him. Gabe tells Andy that he is going <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>this</b> whole situation slide this time and advises Andy to put Erin behind him.|$|E
5|$|The 1995 race {{featured}} 22 mushers, of whom 13 finished. Budget {{problems caused}} the first prize {{to drop by}} 25% to $15,000, contributing to the low participation. This problem was fixed for the 1996 race, with a first-place prize of $25,000. The 1997 race was won by Rick Mackey, brother of later Quest winner Lance Mackey; the two are the only brother-brother winning tandem in Quest history. Following the 1997 race, financial troubles again arose, this time on the Alaska side. Canadian organizers secured international sponsorship for the 1998 race, and when they refused <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>this</b> sponsorship money {{be used to pay}} debts accumulated in Alaska, members of the Alaska board threatened to host a separate competition. In the end, the Alaska board members were forced to resign, and a deal was worked out between the two sides.|$|E

500|$|In {{the prime}} universe, the Fringe team learn {{more of the}} Wave Sink Device from Sam Weiss, {{understanding}} it was created by a long-advanced race known as the First People, {{with the power to}} destroy or create universes, but is only powered by Peter's biology. The two devices in both universes are quantumly entangled, allows one to alter the other universe. Walter surmises that Walternate wants to engage the device to destroy the prime universe in hopes of healing the parallel universe damaged by his crossing in 1985. [...] In the parallel universe, Walternate discovers Fauxilivia is pregnant with Peter's child and discreetly accelerates the pregnancy, as to obtain a sample of the child's blood to activate the Device. The effects on the prime universe are numerous but the parallel universe shows no sign of healing. Walter directs teams to move the prime universe Device to Liberty Island, the same location where the parallel device, as to minimize the affected areas, and then instructs Peter to use the device to counteract the parallel version. Instead, when Peter enters the device, he witnesses a future where the parallel universe was destroyed and the prime universe on verge of the same collapse, and finds that Walter would set a plan in motion to send the Device back into the far past via a wormhole (creating the First People myth), and having it trigger this memory when Peter uses it. After this experience, Peter uses the device to link the two together, fusing the two rooms from the prime and parallel universe into a bridge, allowing the two sides to meet one another. However, shortly after this, Peter disappears to the apparent obliviousness of both Fringe teams; the Observers, looking on, assert that Peter has erased himself from the timeline <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>this</b> event happen.|$|E

2500|$|Austria {{finalized}} its Marshall Plan {{program in}} the end of 1947 and received the first tranche of Marshall Plan aid in March 1948. Heavy industry (or what was left of it) was concentrated around Linz, in the American zone, and in British-occupied Styria. Their products were in high demand in post-war Europe. Naturally, the administrators of the Marshall Plan channeled available financial aid into heavy industry controlled by the American and British forces. American military and political leaders made no secret of their intentions: Geoffrey Keyes said that [...] "we cannot afford <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>this</b> key area (Austria) fall under exclusive influence of the Soviet Union." [...] The Marshall Plan was deployed primarily against the Soviet zone but it was not completely excluded: it received 8% of Marshall plan investments (compared to 25% of food and other physical commodities). The Austrian government regarded financial aid to the Soviet zone as a lifeline holding the country together. This was the only case when Marshall Plan funds were distributed in Soviet-occupied territories.|$|E
