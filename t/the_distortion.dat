40|$|In this paper, the {{possibility}} to apply conventional watermarking methods in a print-cam process is discussed. In the print-cam process, the watermark is read from a printed image with a camera phone. The process inflicts serious attacks to the watermark and, especially geometrical <b>distortions.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>distortions</b> are not inverted, they may destroy the watermark. In this paper, <b>the</b> <b>distortions</b> are corrected from the captured image with invisible, and visible templates and the message is successfully extracted after <b>the</b> <b>distortions</b> have been corrected. The BER values obtained are beneath 1. 1 % with resolution of 1600 x 1200 and JPEG quality factors of 100 % and 80 %. The success ratios are above 98 % with respective settings, which shows that the inversion of <b>the</b> <b>distortions</b> was successful and the watermarking method is robust against the print-cam process.

5|$|The seductive details {{effect has}} {{primarily}} been demonstrated {{at the point}} of knowledge acquisition (initial learning); its impact on transfer performance has not been clearly shown. Theory in text comprehension suggests that seductive details might be detrimental for recall but advantageous for transfer performance because of the schematic representation of information that trainees form during instruction. Researchers have described the seductive details effect as having a damaging effect on recall because it distracts trainees from learning and they tend to form inappropriate schemas to organize information. However, when learners are applying knowledge, empirical studies suggest that <b>the</b> <b>distortion</b> of the macro structure or schema of the instructional material is beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Magnetometers detect minute {{deviations}} in the Earth's {{magnetic field}} caused by iron artifacts, kilns, {{some types of}} stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across the ocean floor have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. <b>The</b> <b>distortion</b> was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The trio battle Lynx for the Frozen Flame, and Lynx gains {{the upper}} hand after {{trapping}} Magil with a powerful spell. He plans to acquire Kid's special gift from Lucca—a Time Egg, or Chrono Trigger. With a Time Egg and the Frozen Flame, Lynx boasts that he shall achieve control over time. Kid lunges at him, but Lynx easily parries her attack and wounds her. She desperately removes the Chrono Trigger from her back pocket. The Trigger shatters and causes a localized temporal distortion, leading Serge to see various scenes in history. Kid learns of her heritage as princess Schala of Zeal, a meek girl who was coerced to help awaken Lavos with her magical power. As Zeal collapsed, Schala was wracked with anguish and guilt {{for her role in}} the incident. Nearby in the Ocean Palace, the Frozen Flame felt her grief and changed her to a baby, sending her to the modern era where Lucca found her. It is also circumstantially revealed that Magil is in fact Magus, Schala's wayward brother who searched for her after battling Lavos in Chrono Trigger. Once <b>the</b> <b>distortion</b> subsides, an army from Porre—a large nation in search of the Frozen Flame—storms the mansion. Lynx withdraws as Kid, Serge, and Magil flee. Kid tells Serge that she is aware of her true origin, and knowing that is a treasure which cannot be stolen. She bids him goodbye before disappearing into the darkness with Magil.|$|E
30|$|Conventional {{end-to-end}} distortion {{models for}} videos measure <b>the</b> overall <b>distortion</b> based on independent estimations of <b>the</b> source <b>distortion</b> and <b>the</b> channel <b>distortion.</b> However, {{they are not}} correlating well with the perceptual characteristics {{where there is a}} strong inter-relationship among <b>the</b> source <b>distortion,</b> <b>the</b> channel <b>distortion,</b> and <b>the</b> video content. As most compressed videos are represented to human users, perception-based end-to-end distortion model should be developed for error-resilient video coding. In this paper, we propose a structural similarity (SSIM)-based end-to-end distortion model to optimally estimate <b>the</b> content-dependent perceptual <b>distortion</b> due to quantization, error concealment, and error propagation. Experiments show that the proposed model brings a better visual quality for H. 264 /AVC video coding over packet-switched networks.|$|R

One may argue that marking <b>the</b> <b>distortions</b> on static state may introduce bias. We try to minimize this effect in two ways. First of all, the annotation was done on a sample frame of the reference animation instead of the modified animation. In this way, <b>the</b> <b>distortions</b> were never seen statically by the observers. Secondly, the user was still able to view both of the animations and manipulate the view-point simultaneously in the viewing screen, during the evaluation.

40|$|International audienceThe {{temporal}} distortions such as flickering, jerkiness and mosquito noise play {{a fundamental}} part in video quality assessment. A temporal distortion is commonly {{defined as the}} temporal evolution, or fluctuation, of <b>the</b> spatial <b>distortion</b> on a particular area which corresponds {{to the image of}} a specific object in the scene. Perception of spatial distortions over time can be largely modified by their temporal changes, such as increase or decrease in <b>the</b> <b>distortions,</b> or as periodic changes in <b>the</b> <b>distortions.</b> In this work, we have designed a perceptual full reference video quality assessment metric by focusing on the temporal evolutions of <b>the</b> spatial <b>distortions.</b> As <b>the</b> perception of <b>the</b> temporal <b>distortions</b> is closely linked to the visual attention mechanisms, we have chosen to first evaluate <b>the</b> temporal <b>distortion</b> at eye fixation level. In this short-term temporal pooling, the video sequence is divided into spatio-temporal segments in which <b>the</b> spatio-temporal <b>distortions</b> are evaluated, resulting in spatio-temporal <b>distortion</b> maps. Afterwards, <b>the</b> global quality score of the whole video sequence is obtained by the long-term temporal pooling in which the spatio-temporal maps are spatially and temporally pooled.
