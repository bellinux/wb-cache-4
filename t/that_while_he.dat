5|$|Before {{the start}} of the Browns' 1954 {{training}} camp, Graham was questioned as part of the Sam Sheppard murder case. Sheppard, an osteopath, was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death, and Graham and his wife, Beverly, were friends with the couple. Graham told police <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> and Beverly liked the Sheppards, they did not know much about their relationship.|$|E
5|$|Dog expert Cecil Meares {{was going}} to Siberia to select the dogs, and Scott ordered <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> was there, he should deal with the {{purchase}} of Manchurian ponies. Meares was not an experienced horse-dealer, and the ponies he chose proved mostly of poor quality, and ill-suited to prolonged Antarctic work. Meanwhile, Scott also recruited Bernard Day, from Shackleton's expedition, as his motor expert.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Malachi leaves Castiel {{with the}} angel Theo who tells Castiel {{he wants to}} defect to Metatron's side. Castiel tricks Theo into {{releasing}} him and steals his Grace, transforming Castiel into an angel once more and at least restoring his powers. Castiel calls Dean and tells him <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> was held captive by Malachi {{he learned that the}} angel Ezekiel is dead and so the angel possessing Sam must be an impostor.|$|E
5000|$|Sidney informs JJ {{the deed}} is done. JJ announces to America <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>he’s</b> away in England, Sidney will write the column. Sidney’s at the {{pinnacle}} ("At The Fountain" [...] (reprise)).|$|R
5000|$|Jungklas said <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>he's</b> {{proud of}} his pop-oriented work in the 1980s, [...] "in my mind, I'm really a blues artist ... folk and blues. People might roll their eyes when I say that. But in my head, that's what it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither do I; {{but it must}} be somethin' 'bout as bad as <b>that.</b> <b>While</b> <b>he's</b> takin' on so we can get him {{off without}} much trouble. We'd better walk to the ferry, 'cause there might be {{somebody}} on the horse-car what would know him." ...|$|R
5|$|He added <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> {{regretted that}} his message had been disowned by Lord Kenmare, that was of less consequence, since his {{manoeuvre}} had succeeded to admiration. Some believe that Sir Boyle, who {{was related to}} Lord Kenmare and often represented his views in Commons, was also stating Lord Kenmare's true views on this occasion and doing so with his full knowledge, {{but in a way}} that provided Kenmare plausible deniability.|$|E
5|$|Twilight confronts Discord, {{accusing him}} of {{cheating}} since he destroyed the labyrinth before they {{could get to the}} end of the game. However, Discord counters this by reminding her <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> had hinted at where the Elements were, he never said anything about them being in the labyrinth. As he disappears and teases the ponies with another storm of chocolate rain, Twilight realizes that a line from Discord's riddle actually refers to Ponyville itself.|$|E
5|$|At King Edward's death, {{only the}} royal estates and the estates of Harold were larger and wealthier than those held by Stigand. Medieval writers {{condemned}} {{him for his}} greed and for his pluralism. Hugh the Chanter, a medieval chronicler, claimed that the confiscated wealth of Stigand helped keep King William on the throne. A recent study of his wealth {{and how it was}} earned shows <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> did engage in some exploitative methods to gain some of his wealth, other lands were gained through inheritance or through royal favour. The same study shows little evidence that he despoiled his episcopal estates, although the record towards monastic houses is more suspect. There is no complaint in contemporary records about his private life, and the accusations that he committed simony and was illiterate only date from the 12th century.|$|E
50|$|Jonny Craig {{said in an}} {{interview}} he has been collaborating with Emarosa on new songs. <b>He</b> says <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>he's</b> not officially a member, he is open to come back. However he later revealed that the band's long-vacant vocalist position has been filled by Bradley Walden, formerly of Squid the Whale.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Blood was generous. [...] "Hardly so much. It {{was just}} vindictiveness that urged him. It's myself he's hunting at Tortuga, my lord. But, I'm {{thinking}} <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>he's</b> about it, I'd best be looking after Jamaica for King William." [...] He laughed, with more mirth {{than he had}} used {{in the last two}} months.|$|R

5|$|During the 1952 presidential election, the Eisenhower {{campaign}} toured Wisconsin with McCarthy. In {{a speech}} delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> agreed with McCarthy's goals, he disagreed with his methods. In draft versions of his speech, Eisenhower had {{also included a}} strong defense of his mentor, George Marshall, which was a direct rebuke of McCarthy's frequent attacks. However, under the advice of conservative colleagues who were fearful that Eisenhower could lose Wisconsin if he alienated McCarthy supporters, he deleted this defense from later versions of his speech. The deletion was discovered by William H. Laurence, a reporter for The New York Times, and featured on its front page the next day. Eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal convictions, and the incident became the low point of his campaign.|$|E
5|$|Gary Steinman of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine {{said that}} the lack of a plotline gave the player no {{incentive}} to keep playing through what he felt was a poor combat system. Both of those criticisms were repeated by Electronic Gaming Monthlys Sam Kennedy in his review. RPGamer's Bilyk felt that the smaller plots, while sometimes simplistic and not focused on the player, were enjoyable experiences. IGN's Smith concluded <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> enjoyed the game, he felt {{that it was not a}} complete game like Secret of Mana, but instead a collection of fun experiences.|$|E
5|$|Heffernan {{sued the}} city, the mayor, and his {{superior}} officers under 42 U.S.C. §1983 {{in the federal}} District Court for New Jersey, claiming that his rights {{of freedom of speech}} as well as freedom of association had been violated. Heffernan contended <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> had not actually engaged in any protected speech, the department acted on the belief that he had, and the department should not have demoted him on the basis of that erroneous belief.|$|E
50|$|The plot {{centers around}} three brothers, {{sophisticated}} armed robbers {{led by the}} shrewd Dale (Pearce) who work with their long-time lawyer, Frank and corrupt police {{to pull off the}} biggest heist in Australian history. Matters become complicated when Dale begins to realize <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>he's</b> been in jail his wife, Carol (Griffiths) has been sleeping with Frank, who has schemes of his own.|$|R
5000|$|Jenny Knight of Guitar & Bass Magazine (magazine) {{gave this}} album a {{positive}} review stating: [...] "This instrumental album from the Mancunian graduate of London's Guitar Institute shows <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>he's</b> learned from such legends as Steve Lukather and Joe Satriani, he's very much his own man. And His fretting skills {{are more than}} capable of taming the wild mix of blues, classical, rock and flamenco that pervades his music." ...|$|R

5|$|In 1974, {{he took a}} {{leave of}} absence from The Tennessean to attend Vanderbilt University Law School. His {{decision}} to become an attorney was a partial result of his time as a journalist, as he realized <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> could expose corruption, he could not change it. Gore did not complete law school, deciding abruptly, in 1976, to run for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives when he found out that his father's former seat in the House was about to be vacated.|$|E
5|$|In November 1993, David Hale—the {{source of}} {{criminal}} allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy—alleged <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> {{was governor of}} Arkansas, Clinton pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal. A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for {{their role in the}} Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.|$|E

Upon his debut in the WWF, Nailz attacked Bossman and stole his nightstick, which he used to attack his opponents over the following months.|$|E
5|$|Key has a mixed {{voting record}} on social issues: for example, in 2004 {{he voted against}} the bill {{creating}} civil unions, stating <b>that,</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> personally supports such unions, he acted in accordance with his electorate's views. However, in 2005, Key {{was part of a}} large bloc of MPs voting to defeat a bill that defined marriage as being {{between a man and a}} woman. Key stated in 2008 that he did not oppose gay adoption.

5|$|On February 11, 2005, {{a report}} on Anime News Network {{mentioned}} a possible live-action Last Exile film. It {{was based on a}} blog post by Patrick Macias, writer for Animerica and {{author of several books on}} Japanese pop culture and anime, which noted <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> was attending the Tokyo International Anime Fair, a Gonzo employee suggested that an unnamed New Line Cinema producer was interested in adapting the series for a live-action production. On July 8, 2009, a concept art image was leaked on the Internet but was removed at the request of filmmakers. However, as of 2013, there has been no new news about the Live-action film, suggesting it has been canceled.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{treaties}} were signed, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, acting {{in his capacity}} as US Indian agent, visited La Pointe. He reprimanded Buffalo for not stopping the continuing sporadic warfare between the Ojibwa and Dakota. Buffalo replied that he was unable to stop the young men of Lac Courte Oreilles, St. Croix, Lac du Flambeau or other bands beyond La Pointe from going against the Dakota. Historians take this to mean <b>that</b> <b>while</b> <b>he</b> was regarded as the head spokesman of the Ojibwa in Wisconsin, he could not control the day-to-day affairs of all the bands, which were highly decentralized, particularly about warfare. Buffalo also said that, unlike the British before the War of 1812, the U.S. Government had not done enough to help maintain the peace among the tribes.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, on 17 November 2009, Näslund {{announced he}} {{was coming out of}} retirement to join Forsberg with Modo {{for the remainder of the}} 2009–10 Elitserien season.

The announcement crashed the Modo web server as a result of the heavy volume of people visiting the site. As a board member of the club, Näslund said he and Forsberg would play without salary.|$|E
