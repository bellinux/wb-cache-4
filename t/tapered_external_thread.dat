40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the amount of deformation from compression caused by different diameters of Morse taper implants and the residual deformation after load removal. Thirty Morse <b>taper</b> implants lacking <b>external</b> <b>threads</b> were divided into 3 groups (n = 10) according to their diameter as follows: 3. 5 mm, 4. 0 mm and 5. 0 mm. Two-piece abutments were fixed into the implants, and the samples were subjected to compressive axial loading up to 1500 N of force. During the test, one strain gauge remained fixed to the cervical portion of each implant to measure the strain variation. The strain values were recorded at two different time points: at the maximum load (1500 N) and 60 seconds after load removal. To calculate the strain at the implant/abutment interface, a mathematical formula was applied. Data were analyzed using a one-way Anova and Tukey&# 8217;s test (&# 945; = 0. 05). The 5. 0 mm diameter implant showed a significantly lower strain (650. 5 &# 956;S ± 170. 0) than the 4. 0 mm group (1170. 2 &# 956;S ± 374. 7) and the 3. 5 mm group (1388. 1 &# 956;S ± 326. 6) (p < 0. 001), regardless of the load presence. The strain values decreased by approximately 50 % after removal of the load, regardless of the implant diameter. The 5. 0 mm implant showed a significantly lower strain at the implant/abutment interface (943. 4 &# 956;S ± 504. 5) than the 4. 0 mm group (1057. 4 &# 956;S ± 681. 3) and the 3. 5 mm group (1159. 6 &# 956;S ± 425. 9) (p < 0. 001).
