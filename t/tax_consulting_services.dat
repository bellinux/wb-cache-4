A notable exception is <b>tax</b> <b>consulting</b> <b>services.</b> We examine whether <b>tax</b> <b>consulting</b> <b>services</b> {{are associated with}} the likelihood of tax-related and other material weaknesses in internal control. The extent of tax consulting measured by the ratio of tax fees to total fees is associated with a significantly lower likelihood of a tax-related internal control weaknesses, but an indicator variable for the presence of tax consulting is not. The tax fee ratio is also associated with a reduced likelihood of other types of internal control weaknesses. These results are consistent with auditor-provided tax services reducing independence, rather than knowledge spillovers arising from the provision of tax services. ...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the American economy shows that the service sector overshadows the manufacturing sector, both in size and in state of tunnoil. The tunnoil is due to Ute rapid expansion of franchise chains, computerization, evolving professional standards, and competitive pressures. From the consumer's perspective, as client sensitivity intensifies and professional malpractice suits become more threatening, the issue of understanding and examining services becomes more important. In line with Wind's (1982) observation, service decisions in a finn {{are not limited to}} individual services. A finn should take into account its service line (a number of related services), service mix (combination of service lines), and service portfolio (assortments of service mixes). The lines of demarcation among these tenns are not always clear because they depend on organizational position as well as personal preferences in defining classification systems. At the most basic level, an institution offers only a singular service. Extensions of offerings within a restricted and related group of service categories constitute a service line, an exanlple of which is the <b>tax</b> <b>consulting</b> <b>services</b> market where an accountant may file a tax form on behalf of a client either by mail or through computer services linked up with the IRS office. peer-reviewe...|$|E

This study attempted to determine whether a dominant learning style exists within a major national accounting firm and whether a relationship exists between learning style and (1) functional area within the firm, (2) professional level within the firm, and (3) professional level within functional area of the firm. The Learning Style Inventory instrument developed by David Kolb in 1985 was used to measure learning styles and learning preferences for a representative sample of the firm's professional personnel. Previous research into learning styles of accountants has focused on collegiate student populations. Limited research has been done with accountants active in professional practice. This research is an in-depth study of learning styles and learning preferences of one accounting firm that is national in scope. The converger learning style was identified as the dominant learning style within the firm. This finding was consistent with findings of other researchers such as B. A. Baldwin and P. M. Reckers in 1984 and R. E. Baker, J. R. Simon and F. P. Bazeli in 1986 and 1987. The study suggests that the learning style measure may not be sensitive enough to detect differences among learning preferences of personnel within a professional group such as an accounting firm. This finding appears consistent with findings by researchers who have focused on other professional groups, such as L. C. Smedley in 1984 and C. Miller in 1979. Learning preference profiles were developed for functional areas of the firm. The profiles provide a basis for further study into the professional growth and development process that takes place within functional areas (audit, <b>tax,</b> <b>consulting</b> <b>services,</b> and management) of a major national accounting firm...|$|E

Two primary factors limited GAO's ability to identify a list of consulting contracts that was sufficiently accurate and complete for identifying the types and costs of <b>consulting</b> <b>services</b> used by VA. First, there is no consistently used definition for consultant or <b>consulting</b> <b>services</b> across VA that GAO could apply for our intended purposes. Second, there are data limitations associated with identifying <b>consulting</b> <b>services</b> at VA. Since there is no means for contracting officers to track obligations for <b>consulting</b> <b>services</b> in the Federal Procurement Data System-New Generation, GAO used North American Industrial Classification Codes (NAICS) to identify contracts that could be for consulting. However, GAO could not use the NAICS codes to consistently identify consulting contracts because a single NAICS code can be used to classify both <b>consulting</b> and nonconsulting <b>services</b> and VA contracting officers sometimes reported that they had applied the wrong NAICS code to contracts. Nevertheless, VA offices were able to provide information on how they used <b>consulting</b> <b>services</b> and identified contracts among those in our sample that they considered to be <b>consulting</b> <b>services.</b> For contracts that VA officials considered to be for consulting, VA procured a variety of services, including program evaluations, engineering and support services, and gathering data to support decision making. ...|$|R
