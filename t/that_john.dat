5|$|A {{commercial}} document from 30 January 1359, which testifies to John's continuing {{trade relations with}} Venice, is chronologically the last reference to his activity in contemporary sources.

5|$|According to the Tales of the Minstrel of Reims, he {{was buried}} in Hagia Sophia. Perry wrote <b>that</b> <b>John,</b> who died as a Franciscan friar, may have been buried in the Franciscan church {{dedicated}} to Saint Francis of Assisi which was built in Galata during his reign. In a third theory, proposed by Giuseppe Gerola, a tomb decorated with the Latin Empire coat of arms in Assisi's Lower Basilica may have been built for John by Walter VI, Count of Brienne.|$|E
5|$|According {{to three}} 13th-century authors (Matthew Paris, Salimbene di Adam and Bernard of Besse), John became a Franciscan friar before his death. They agree that John's declining health {{contributed to his}} conversion, but Bernard also {{described}} a recurring vision {{of an old man}} urging the emperor to join the Franciscans. Most 13th-century sources suggest <b>that</b> <b>John</b> died between 19 and 23 March 1237, the only Latin emperor to die in Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|Chroniclers Richard of Devizes, William of Newburgh, Roger of Hoveden and Ralph de Diceto were {{generally}} unsympathetic to John's behaviour under Richard, but {{more tolerant of}} the earliest years of John's reign. Accounts of the middle and later years of his reign are limited to Gervase of Canterbury and Ralph of Coggeshall, neither of whom were satisfied with John's performance as king. His later negative reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king's death: Roger of Wendover and Matthew Paris. The latter claimed <b>that</b> <b>John</b> attempted to convert to Islam, {{but this is not}} believed by modern historians.|$|E

Henry died on 6 July 1189, aged 56; the King had wished to be interred at Grandmont Abbey in the Limousin, but the hot weather made transporting his body impractical and he was instead buried at the nearby Fontevraud Abbey.|$|E

5|$|Id Software's use of {{texture mapping}} in Catacomb 3-D, a {{precursor}} to Wolfenstein 3D, was influenced by Ultima Underworld. Conflicting accounts exist regarding the extent of this influence, however. In the book Masters of Doom, author David Kushner asserts that the concept was discussed only briefly during a 1991 telephone conversation between Paul Neurath and John Romero. However, Doug Church has said <b>that</b> <b>John</b> Carmack saw the game's summer 1990 software convention demo, and recalled a comment from Carmack that he could write a faster texture mapper. Paul Neurath has recounted the incident similarly, with both Carmack and Romero present.|$|E

Jack throws the device over the building, and John pushes him off the roof in retaliation.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} as to exactly why John emigrated to Serbia instead of assuming a high-ranking position in Bulgaria, as his ancestry and family ties would suggest. Bulgarian historian Ivan Bozhilov {{is of the}} opinion <b>that</b> <b>John</b> was not seeking political refuge in Serbia. Instead, it is most likely that he moved to that country {{with the belief that}} Serbia's territorial expansion and political influence in that period would secure him better career opportunities. Presumably, John accompanied his sister Helena when she moved to Serbia to marry Stephen Dušan in 1332.|$|E
