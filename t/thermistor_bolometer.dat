40|$|The {{temperature}} stabilization {{requirements of}} unchopped thermistor bolometers and thermopile detectors are analyzed. The detector temperature, {{on which the}} bolometer output signal depends, is quite sensitive to changes in instrument temperature but relatively insensitive to changes in scene temperature. In contrast, the difference in temperature between detector and substrate (instrument), on which the thermopile signal depends, is equally sensitive to changes in instrument and scene temperature. Expressions for these dependencies are derived based on a simplified instrument model. It is shown that for a typical uncooled thermal imager, the temperature stabilization requirements for a bolometer are two orders of magnitude more stringent than those for a thermopile detector.

Thermistor bolometers were the sensors used for the ERBE scanning radiometric package. Each <b>thermistor</b> <b>bolometer</b> package consisted of three narrow field of view (FOV) broadband radiometric channels measuring shortwave (0. 2 to 5. 0 jim), longwave (5. 0 to 50 jim), and total (0. 2 to 50 pin) radiation. The in-flight calibration facilities include Mirror Attenuator Mosaics (MAM), shortwave internal calibration source (SWICS), and internal blackbody sources to monitor the long-term responsivity of the radiometers.

The ERBE radiometric packages were placed into orbit aboard the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) and the NOAA- 9 and NOAA- 10 spacecraft platforms.

40|$|Orbital {{measurements}} of the earth's longwave emitted radiation, and the sun's radiation reflected by the earth are being made by scanning radiometers on three spacecraft platforms in both high altitude sun-synchronous polar (833 km) and low altitude (600 km) equatorial orbits. These ERBE instruments were carried aboard two TIROS ATN satellites (NOAA- 9 and - 10) in December 1984, and September 1986, and on the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite launched from Space Shuttle mission 41 -G in October 1984. Electronic problems with the scanners on all platforms have halted the reception of data after surpassing the scanner design life.

On November 27, 1997, the launch of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) spacecraft placed the first set of CERES sensors into orbit, and 30 days later, the sensors initiated operational measurements of the earth radiance fields. In 1998, the Earth Observing System morning (EOS-AM 1) spacecraft will place the second and third sensor sets into orbit. The prelaunch CERES sensors' count conversion coefficients (gains and zero-radiance offsets) were determined in vacuum ground facilities. The gains were tied radiometrically to the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS- 90). The gain determinations included the spectral properties (reflectance, transmittance, emittance, etc.) of both the sources and sensors as well as the in-field-of-view (FOV) and out-of-FOV sensor responses. The resulting prelaunch coefficients for the TRMM and EOS-AM 1 sensors are presented. Inflight calibration systems and on-orbit calibration approaches are described, which are being used to determine the temporal stabilities of the sensors' gains and offsets from prelaunch calibrations through on-orbit measurements. Analyses of the TRMM prelaunch and on-orbit calibration results indicate that the sensors have retained their ties to ITS- 90 at accuracy levels better than /- 0. 3 % between the 1995 prelaunch and 1997 on-orbit calibrations...|$|E

However, the CERES scanning <b>thermistor</b> <b>bolometer</b> sensor zero-radiance offsets were found to vary as much as 1. 0 Wm (exp - 2) sr (exp - 1) with the scan angle measurement geometry due to gravitational forces and systematic electronic noise. To minimize the gravitational effects, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Spacecraft CERES sensors' offsets were derived on-orbit as functions of scan elevation and azimuth angles from the January 7 - 8, 1998 radiometric observations of deep cold space, representative of a 3 K blackbody. In this paper, the TRMM/CERES six orbit data base of on-orbit derived offsets is presented and analyzed to define the sampling requirements for the CERES sensors located on the Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) Terra Spacecraft and on the Earth Observing System (EOS) Afternoon (PM- 1) Spacecraft, scheduled for launches in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Analyses of the TRMM/CERES shortwave sensor earth radiance measurements indicate that offsets can be determined on-orbit at the plus or minus 0. 02 Wm (exp - 2) sr (exp - 1) precision level.

November 1997, the first set of CERES bolometers is scheduled for launch on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Spacecraft. The CERES bolometers were calibrated radiometrically in a vacuum ground facility using absolute reference sources, tied to the International Temperature Scale of 1990. Accurate bolometer calibrations are dependent upon the derivations of the radiances from the spectral properties [reflectance, transmittance, emittance, etc. ] of both the sources and bolometers. In this paper, the overall calibration approaches are discussed for the longwave and shortwave calibrations.

40|$|Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) {{techniques}} {{are being used}} to characterize the relative spectral response, or sensitivity, of scanning <b>thermistor</b> <b>bolometers</b> in the infrared (IR) region (2 - >= 100 -micrometers). The bolometers are being used in the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) program. The CERES measurements are designed to provide precise, long term monitoring of the Earth's atmospheric radiation energy budget. The CERES instrument houses three bolometric radiometers, a total wavelength (0. 3 - >= 150 -micrometers) sensor, a shortwave (0. 3 - 5 -micrometers) sensor, and an atmospheric window (8 - 12 -micrometers) sensor. Accurate spectral characterization is necessary for determining filtered radiances for longwave radiometric calibrations. The CERES bolometers spectral response's are measured in the TRW FTS Vacuum Chamber Facility (FTS - VCF), which uses a FTS as the source and a cavity pyroelectric trap detector as the reference. The CERES bolometers and the cavity detector are contained in a vacuum chamber, while the FTS source is housed in a GN 2 purged chamber. Due to the thermal time constant of the CERES bolometers, the FTS must be operated in a step mode. Data are acquired in 6 IR spectral bands covering the entire longwave IR region. In this paper, the TRW spectral calibration facility design and data measurement {{techniques are}} described. Two approaches are presented which convert the total channel FTS data into the final CERES spectral characterizations, producing the same calibration coefficients (within 0. 1 percent).
