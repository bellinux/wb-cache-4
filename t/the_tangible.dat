5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tangible</b> and {{intangible}} {{cultural heritage}} of Antananarivo is extensive and highly significant to regional and national populations. The city has numerous monuments, historic buildings, sites of significance and traditions related to the customs {{and history of the}} central highlands people. The city skyline is dominated by the Rova of Antananarivo, which was destroyed in a 1995 fire but are undergoing reconstruction. The nearby Andafiavaratra Palace was the home of 19th century Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony and currently contains a museum featuring historic artifacts of the Kingdom of Imerina, including items saved from the fire at the Rova. Downhill from the palaces is Andohalo square, where Merina kings and queens delivered speeches to the public. Tsimbazaza Zoo displays many of the island's unique animal species and a complete skeleton of the now-extinct elephant bird. Other historic buildings include the Ambatondrafandrana tribunal where Ranavalona I dispensed judgement, the second residence of Rainilaiarivony with its indigenous medicinal plant garden, the recently renovated Soarano railroad station, four late 19th century memorial churches built to commemorate early Malagasy Christian martyrs, the tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo, and the early 20th century pavilions of the Analakely market. Open air markets include Le Pochard and the artisan market at Andravoahangy. The Museum of Art and Archaeology in the Isoraka neighborhood features exhibits on the history and cultures of Madagascar's diverse ethnic groups.|$|E

This notion is also described as looping effects or feedback effects in cognition and culture, whereby the causal understanding of a particular social group changes the very character of the group, leading to further change in the phenomenon under investigation.|$|E

In October 1256, Bayju {{defeated}} Kaykaus II near Aksaray and all of Anatolia became officially subject to Möngke Khan. In 1260 Kaykaus II fled from Konya to Crimea where he died in 1279.

25|$|Order {{method of}} cost-finding : When the order is <b>the</b> <b>tangible</b> basis {{upon which the}} {{elements}} of cost are charged, compiled, and determined, the order method of cost-finding is generally used. In other words, under such conditions the material costs, labor costs, and a pro rata share of the factory overhead are all charged to definite factory orders, and the elements of material, labor, and overhead costs are compiled so that the total factory cost of each individual order may be determined. If a number of units are manufactured under the definite factory order, the unit article cost may be determined by dividing the total factory cost by the total quantity manufactured or produced. Definite factory orders may be issued for the manufacture {{of a number of}} units, for a single unit, or for the manufacture of certain parts of a unit.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the core}} {{character}} deficits of highly psychopathic individuals {{are likely to}} be highly incorrigible to the currently available treatment methods, the antisocial and criminal behavior associated with it may be more amenable to management, the management of which being the main aim of therapy programs in correctional settings. It has been suggested that the treatments that may be most likely to be effective at reducing overt antisocial and criminal behavior are those that focus on self-interest, emphasizing <b>the</b> <b>tangible,</b> material value of prosocial behavior, with interventions that develop skills to obtain what the patient wants out of life in prosocial rather than antisocial ways. To this end, various therapies have been tried with the aim of reducing the criminal activity of incarcerated offenders with psychopathy, with mixed success. As psychopathic individuals are insensitive to sanction, reward-based management, in which small privileges are granted in exchange for good behavior, has been suggested and used to manage their behavior in institutional settings.|$|E
25|$|Under {{pressure}} from the Reichswehr (German armed forces) leadership (whose members viewed the enormous {{armed forces of the}} SA as an existential threat) and with the collusion of Göring, Joseph Goebbels, the Gestapo and SD, Hitler was led to believe that Roehm's SA posed a serious conspiratorial threat requiring a drastic and immediate solution. For its part, the SD provided fictitious information that there was an assassination plot on Hitler's life and that an SA putsch to assume power was imminent since the SA were allegedly amassing weapons. Additionally, reports were coming in to the SD and Gestapo that the vulgarity of the SA's behavior was damaging the party and was even making antisemitism less palatable. On 30 June 1934 the SS and Gestapo acted in coordinated mass arrests that continued for two days. The SS took one of its most decisive steps in eliminating its competition for command of security within Germany and established itself firmly in the Nazi hierarchy, making the SS and its intelligence organ, the SD, responsible only to the Führer. The purge became known as the Night of the Long Knives, with up to 200 people killed in the action. Moreover, the brutal crushing of the SA and its leadership sent a clear message to everyone that opposition to Hitler's regime could be fatal. It struck fear across the Nazi leadership as to <b>the</b> <b>tangible</b> concern of the reach and influence of Himmler's intelligence collection and policing powers.|$|E

500|$|In his 1990 book Sea-Brothers: The Tradition of American Sea Fiction from Moby-Dick to the Present, author Bert Bender noted Crane's {{sympathetic}} {{portrayal of}} the oiler Billie, the most physically able of the four characters, and yet {{the only one to}} perish. The correspondent even notes with wonder Billie's exceptional ability to row despite having worked a double shift before the ship sank. Bender wrote that Crane [...] "emphasizes that Billie's steady, simple labor is <b>the</b> <b>tangible</b> basis for his role here as a savior," [...] and that the oiler's portrayal as a [...] "simple, working seaman, clearly expresses his sympathy with the democratic ideal of the sailor before the mast that figures so crucially in the tradition of American sea fiction." [...] That Billie does not survive the ordeal, however, can be seen as an antithesis to Darwinism in that the only person to not survive was in fact the strongest physically.|$|E
500|$|Many of Shen Kuo's contemporaries were {{interested}} in antiquarian pursuits of collecting old artworks. They were also interested in archaeological pursuits, although for rather different reasons than why Shen Kuo held an interest in archaeology. While Shen's educated Confucian contemporaries {{were interested}} in obtaining ancient relics and antiques in order to revive their use in rituals, Shen was more concerned with how items from archeological finds were originally manufactured and what their functionality would have been, based on empirical evidence. Shen Kuo criticized those in his day who reconstructed ancient ritual objects using only their imagination and not <b>the</b> <b>tangible</b> evidence from archeological digs or finds. Shen also disdained the notion of others that these objects were products of the [...] "sages" [...] or the aristocratic class of antiquity, rightfully crediting the items' manufacture and production to the common working people and artisans of previous eras. Fraser and Haber write that Shen Kuo [...] "advocated {{the use of an}} interdisciplinary approach to archaeology and practiced such an approach himself through his work in metallurgy, optics, and geometry in the study of ancient measures." ...|$|E
500|$|Clifton and Ebert, too, {{focussed}} on Cochrane's {{attempt to}} find and conceptualise a middle ground between the work of Regan (who advocates animal rights) and Singer (who advocates animal welfare from a utilitarian perspective), and Meijer praised it for identifying a conceptual space between animal rights and animal liberation. Clifton suggested that Cochrane's thought is actually closer to Regan's. Boisseau, though, suggested that, given that Cochrane allows some use of animals in entertainment and genetic engineering, the arguments of Animal Rights Without Liberation may come across as [...] "radically permissive" [...] when {{compared with those of}} other animal rights positions. The permissibility of some forms of animal experimentation under Cochrane's account [...] "may shock" [...] supporters of approaches based upon Regan's philosophy. Ebert concluded that [...] "the great accomplishment of Cochrane's book is to show that there is a coherent, intuitively plausible, and useful notion of animal rights that is firmly rooted in <b>the</b> <b>tangible</b> and avoids the unattractive absolutism of Regan-style rights views". Meijer felt that the book is strong on the application of Cochrane's account, but she expressed concern about Cochrane's rejection of liberty rights for animals, which, she noted, most approaches to animal rights allow. Cochrane's deploys, she noted, a narrow account of animal agency; [...] "it is", she argued, [...] "problematic to view humans as autonomous agents and other animals as nonautonomous others". Cochrane's view of animals as non-autonomous, she argued, is emphasised by the absence of an account of relationships and communication between humans and animals.|$|E

500|$|Ten Freedom Summers {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received a weighted average score of 99, based on 8 reviews. In The Guardian, Fordham called it [...] "a landmark in jazz's rich canon", while Bill Shoemaker of The Wire deemed it [...] "a monumental evocation of America's civil rights movement". Glen Hall of Exclaim! wrote that [...] "Smith's music resonates with {{the suffering and}} the dreams {{of a better life}} that embodied the decade of 1954 to 1964 {{that is the subject of}} this powerful compendium of compositions." [...] AllMusic's Thom Jurek viewed the box set as Smith's best work, writing that it [...] "belongs in jazz's canonical lexicon with Duke Ellington's Black Brown & Beige and Max Roach's Freedom Now Suite." [...] Phil Johnson from The Independent found the music very gratifying, comparing it to if Miles Davis had recorded Ligeti during the 1950s. Langhoff wrote in PopMatters that the set was [...] "about sound: <b>the</b> <b>tangible,</b> physically beautiful sounds of Smith's imperative trumpet and of different instruments in combination, testing their own limits." [...] He asserted in conclusion, [...] "In four and a half hours, Wadada Leo Smith writes one of America's defining events in sound, and the story is all of ours." [...] In Cadence Magazine, Rusch was less enthusiastic and felt the box set could have benefitted from being released as four separate albums, writing that listening to the record in its entirety was [...] "exhausting, but also involving and inspiring".|$|E
