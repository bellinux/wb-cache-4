25|$|Thermopiles {{are used}} for {{measuring}} the intensity of incident radiation, typically visible or infrared light, which heats the hot junctions, while the cold junctions are on a heat sink. It is possible to measure radiative intensities {{of only a few}} μW/cm2 with commercially available <b>thermopile</b> sensors. For example, some laser power meters are based on such sensors; these are specifically known as <b>thermopile</b> laser sensor.|$|E
25|$|As {{illustrated}} {{in the use of}} the thermostat above, all of the power for the control system is provided by a <b>thermopile</b> which is a combination of many stacked thermocouples, heated by the pilot light. The <b>thermopile</b> produces sufficient electrical power to drive a low-power gas valve, which under control of one or more thermostat switches, in turn controls the input of fuel to the burner.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of {{operation of a}} <b>thermopile</b> sensor is distinct {{from that of a}} bolometer, as the latter relies on a change in resistance.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{a number}} of {{thermocouples}} connected in series called <b>thermopiles</b> are used. General advantages of <b>thermopiles</b> are their stability, low ohmic value (which implies little pickup of electromagnetic disturbances), good signal-noise ratio {{and the fact that}} zero input gives zero output. Disadvantageous is the low sensitivity.|$|R
40|$|Figures {{of merit}} {{condensing}} the performance parameters of radiation sensors such as responsivity, noise equivalent power, and time constant {{in a single}} number can be useful for rating {{the performance of a}} particular sensor in comparison to other ones or to fundamental performance limits. The classification system and the figures of merit of radiation sensors introduced by R. C. Jones are revisited for thermal radiation sensors with the focus on <b>thermopiles</b> and bolometers. As a result it is stated that radiation <b>thermopiles</b> and bolometers should be classified differently: type III detectors for <b>thermopiles</b> vs. type II detectors for bolometers. Modified figures of merit are suggested and relations between them given. The figures of merit are applied in an overview on state-of-the-art <b>thermopiles</b> and bolometers operated at room temperature...|$|R

25|$|In 1865, John Tyndall {{described}} {{radiation from}} electrically heated filaments and from carbon arcs as visible and invisible. Tyndall spectrally decomposed the radiation {{by use of}} a rock salt prism, which passed heat as well as visible rays, and measured the radiation intensity {{by means of a}} <b>thermopile.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1848 Henry {{worked in}} {{conjunction}} with Professor Stephen Alexander to determine the relative temperatures for {{different parts of the}} solar disk. They used a <b>thermopile</b> to determine that sunspots were cooler than the surrounding regions. This work was shown to the astronomer Angelo Secchi who extended it, but with some question as to whether Henry was given proper credit for his earlier work.|$|E
25|$|Thermocouples can be {{connected}} in series {{to form a}} <b>thermopile,</b> where all the hot junctions are exposed to a higher temperature and all the cold junctions to a lower temperature. The output {{is the sum of}} the voltages across the individual junctions, giving larger voltage and power output. In a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, the radioactive decay of transuranic elements as a heat source has been used to power spacecraft on missions too far from the Sun to use solar power.|$|E

50|$|Thermocouples and <b>thermopiles</b> are {{devices that}} use the Seebeck effect to measure the {{temperature}} difference between two objects. Thermocouples are often used to measure high temperatures, holding the temperature of one junction constant or measuring it independently (cold junction compensation). <b>Thermopiles</b> use many thermocouples electrically connected in series, for sensitive measurements of very small temperature difference.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{microelectromechanical}} system (MEMS) two-dimensional (2 D) wind direction and wind speed sensor {{consisting of a}} square heating source and four <b>thermopiles</b> was manufactured using the heat detection method. The heating source and <b>thermopiles</b> of the manufactured sensor must be exposed to air to detect wind speed and wind direction. Therefore, there are concerns that the sensor could be contaminated by deposition or adhesion of dust, sandy dust, snow, rain, and so forth, in the air, and that the membrane may be damaged by physical shock. Hence, {{there was a need}} to protect the heating source, <b>thermopiles,</b> and the membrane from environmental and physical shock. The upper protective coating to protect both the heating source and <b>thermopiles</b> and the lower protective coating to protect the membrane were formed by using high-molecular substances such as SU- 8, Teflon and polyimide (PI). The sensor characteristics with the applied protective coatings were evaluated...|$|R
25|$|Tyndall {{explained}} {{the heat in}} the Earth's atmosphere {{in terms of the}} capacities of the various gases in the air to absorb radiant heat, also known as infrared radiation. His measuring device, which used <b>thermopile</b> technology, is an early landmark in the history of absorption spectroscopy of gases. He was the first to correctly measure the relative infrared absorptive powers of the gases nitrogen, oxygen, water vapour, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, etc. (year 1859). He concluded that water vapour is the strongest absorber of radiant heat in the atmosphere and is the principal gas controlling air temperature. Absorption by the other gases is not negligible but relatively small. Prior to Tyndall it was widely surmised that the Earth's atmosphere has a Greenhouse Effect, but {{he was the first to}} prove it. The proof was that water vapour strongly absorbed infrared radiation. Relatedly, Tyndall in 1860 was first to demonstrate and quantify that visually transparent gases are infrared emitters.|$|E
25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a <b>thermopile</b> is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.|$|E
2500|$|Measurement of the emissivities of gases at {{temperatures}} up to 1000°C. Emissivity values were required for gaseous aluminium chlorides {{as part of}} the development of the sub-halide distillation process mentioned above. A flowing column of the gas to be measured, heated in a refractory tube, was maintained at a fixed length by gas barriers at each end, formed by balanced opposing streams of argon. [...] The radiation emitted by the gas was measured by a <b>thermopile.</b> A diaphragm was set up to shield this sensor from radiation emitted by the furnace and other hot parts of the equipment. [...] The whole apparatus was mounted on a water-cooled optical bench.|$|E

2500|$|Newer digital {{thermostats}} have no {{moving parts}} to measure temperature and instead rely on thermistors or {{other semiconductor devices}} such as a resistance thermometer (resistance temperature detector). Typically one or more regular batteries must be installed to operate it, although some so-called [...] "power stealing" [...] digital thermostats use the common 24 volt AC circuits as a power source, but will not operate on <b>thermopile</b> powered [...] "millivolt" [...] circuits used in some furnaces. [...] Each has an LCD screen showing the current temperature, and the current setting. [...] Most also have a clock, and time-of-day and even day-of-week settings for the temperature, used for comfort and energy conservation. [...] Some advanced models have touch screens, {{or the ability to}} work with home automation or building automation systems.|$|E
2500|$|In 1821, the German {{physicist}} Thomas Johann Seebeck {{discovered that}} when different metals are {{joined at the}} ends {{and there is a}} temperature difference between the joints, a magnetic field is observed. At the time Seebeck referred to this as thermo-magnetism. The magnetic field he observed was later shown to be due to thermo-electric current. In practical use, the voltage generated at a single junction of two different types of wire is what is of interest as this can be used to measure temperature at very high and low temperatures. [...] The magnitude of the voltage depends on the types of wire used. [...] Generally, the voltage is in the microvolt range and care must be taken to obtain a usable measurement. [...] Although very little current flows, power can be generated by a single thermocouple junction. [...] Power generation using multiple thermocouples, as in a <b>thermopile,</b> is common.|$|E

40|$|The {{technology}} for in-plane poly-Si <b>thermopiles</b> has been developed. The bulk-micromachined <b>thermopiles</b> are located between two Si bars and connected thermally with those bars through thin-film thermal shunts.

The sensor chip consists of a heater in between two <b>thermopiles</b> on a novel perforated membrane, thus liquid flows on both sides. Compared to the conventional constant overtemperature/current operation the heater is now operated in non-steady state/pulsed mode and step responses of both <b>thermopiles</b> are evaluated.

The sensor, fabricated by post-processing chips produced with a standard microelectronic process, is operated in closed loop configuration through a single operational amplifier, {{in such a way that}} the flow-induced temperature difference between the two <b>thermopiles</b> is cancelled by applying a power mismatch to the two heaters. The output signal is proportional to the heater power unbalance. Static and dynamic electrical characterization of the sensor is performed.

50|$|In {{the modern}} <b>thermopile</b> pyranometers the active (hot) {{junctions}} of the <b>thermopile</b> are located beneath the black coating surface and are heated by the radiation absorbed {{from the black}} coating. The passive (cold) junctions of the <b>thermopile</b> are fully protected from solar radiation and in thermal contact with the pyranometer housing, {{which serves as a}} heat-sink. This prevents any alteration from yellowing or decay when measuring the temperature in the shade, thus impairing the measure of the solar irradiance.|$|E

40|$|The {{realization}} of a body-area network demands innovative solutions to efficiently power the wireless sensor nodes that typically consume about 100 µW of power. Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) harvesting energy from wasted human body heat provide an attractive solution, potentially producing about 30 µW per square centimeter of human skin. As a proof of concept, a wireless pulse oximeter {{has been developed}} that is fully powered by a watch-style TEG using commercial BiTe <b>thermopiles.</b> For a 15 seconds measurement interval, approximately 89 µW of power is required from the generator, safely within the available 100 µW power budget.

500|$|Plutonium-238 is {{potentially}} more efficient isotope for nuclear reactors, {{since it has}} smaller critical mass than uranium-235, but it continues to release much thermal energy (0.56 W/g) by decay even when the fission chain reaction is stopped by control rods.
