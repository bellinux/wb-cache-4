500|$|The first Kinzua Bridge {{was built}} by a crew of 40 from [...] of wrought iron in just 94working days, between May 10 and August 29, 1882. The reason for the short {{construction}} time was that scaffolding was not used in the bridge's construction; instead a gin pole was used to build the first tower, then a <b>traveling</b> <b>crane</b> was built atop it and used in building the second tower. The process was then repeated across all 20towers.|$|E
60|$|Some {{delicate}} and important work was being done, and Stuyvesant {{had had his}} lunch sent up to the dam. Bethune and Dick joined him afterwards, {{and sat in the}} shade of a big <b>traveling</b> <b>crane.</b> Stuyvesant and Dick were hot and dirty, for it was not their custom to be content with giving orders when urgent work was going on. Bethune looked languid and immaculately neat. His speciality was mathematics, and he said he did not see why the man with mental talents should dissipate his energy by using his hands.|$|E
60|$|For {{the next}} few days he was busily occupied. A drum of the <b>traveling</b> <b>crane</b> broke and as it could not be {{replaced}} for a time, Dick put up an iron derrick of Bethune's design to lower the concrete blocks into place. They were forced to use such material as they could find, and the gang of peons who handled the chain-tackle made a poor substitute for a steam engine. In consequence, the work progressed slowly and Stuyvesant ordered it to be carried on into the night. Jake and Bethune grumbled, but Dick found the longer hours and extra strain something of a relief. He had now no leisure to indulge in painful thoughts; besides, while he was busy at the dam he could not watch Kenwardine, and his duty to his employer justified his putting off an unpleasant task.|$|E

40|$|The {{operators}} of overhead <b>traveling</b> <b>cranes</b> experience discomfort {{as a result}} of the vibrations of crane structures. These vibrations are produced by defects in the rails on which the cranes move. To improve the comfort of operators, a nine-degree-of-freedom (nine-DOF) mathematical model of a “human–crane–rail” system was constructed. Based on the theoretical guidance provided in ISO 2631 - 1, an annoyance rate model was established, and quantization results were determined. A dynamic optimization design method for overhead <b>traveling</b> <b>cranes</b> is proposed. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was used to optimize the crane structural design, with the structure parameters as the basic variables, the annoyance rate model as the objective function, and the acceleration amplitude and displacement amplitude of the crane as the constraint conditions. The proposed model and method were used to optimize the design of a double-girder 100 [*]t– 28. 5 [*]m casting crane, and the optimal parameters are obtained. The results show that optimization decreases the human annoyance rate from 28. 3 % to 9. 8 % and the root mean square of the weighted acceleration of human vibration from 0. 59 [*]m/s 2 to 0. 38 [*]m/s 2. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the models and method proposed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a new control design for precisely controlling overhead <b>traveling</b> <b>cranes</b> using microprocessors. Overhead cranes are widely used in manufacturing factories and are currently controlled by human operators. Automatic control can bring a number of important benefits, but existing algorithms tend to result in steady-state positioning errors in the presence of friction. In the proposed control design, a state feedback control algorithm is used to guarantee stability, a trajectory planner used to avoid saturation, and an additional integral term is used to eliminate steady-state error. Theoretical analysis and experimental implementation on a laboratory crane verifies the effectiveness of the approach...|$|R

40|$|For {{safe and}} {{efficient}} work of handling task for heavy load by overhead <b>traveling</b> <b>crane,</b> sway of the suspended load should be avoided. Various {{methods have been}} proposed to reduce the sway, mostly by using feedback control methods. However, most material handling system uses open loop type servo controller where trapezoidal or S-shape velocity pattern is typically used for the input of the controller. Considering use of such servo controller, this paper proposes an anti-sway open loop control method based on natural period of the overhead <b>traveling</b> <b>crane</b> system and by using trapezoidal or S-shape velocity pattern for the desired input of the controller. Theoretical analysis for the conditions of no sway by the trapezoidal and S-shape velocity pattern input is presented. This method can be easily applied for an anti-sway control of the crane system when typical servo controller is used. The idea is also applied for the case of changing rope length of the overhead <b>traveling</b> <b>crane</b> system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Most of the time, the {{strength}} structures {{who have not}} been statically determined, cut to the right sized, and checked out by the classic methods of the material strength cause the over sizing, because specialists use approximate measurements in order to decrease the number of mathematical calculation. This paper work describes the optimization of the main beam of a strength structure of a <b>traveling</b> <b>crane</b> used in metallurgy – by using the OPTSTAR mode that the COSMOS/M calculation software encloses which uses finite elements. In order to accomplish the best suited size, we have to perform both an analytic and experimental study about the performance of the <b>traveling</b> <b>crane.</b> In order to do that, we analyze the state of the tensions and deformation of {{the strength}} structure by using this calculation software based on COSMOS finite elements. In order to validate the analytic study, we have performed some industrial experiments by using specific devices for measuring the resistance of the electrical tension. Both the analytic and experimental studies have pointed out that we are {{able to come up with}} the best sizes in order to reduce the material consumption we used during the production process of the main beam within the strength structure of the <b>traveling</b> <b>crane</b> we have analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Background: In this study, the {{measurement}} of job stress of electric overhead <b>traveling</b> <b>crane</b> operators and quantification {{of the effects of}} operator and workplace characteristics on job stress were assessed. Methods: Job stress was measured on five subscales: employee empowerment, role overload, role ambiguity, rule violation, and job hazard. The characteristics of the operators that were studied were age, experience, body weight, and body height. The workplace characteristics considered were hours of exposure, cabin type, cabin feature, and crane height. The proposed methodology included administration of a questionnaire survey to 76 electric overhead <b>traveling</b> <b>crane</b> operators followed by analysis using analysis of variance and a classification and regression tree. Results: The key findings were: (1) the five subscales can be used to measure job stress; (2) employee empowerment was the most significant factor followed by the role overload; (3) workplace characteristics contributed more towards job stress than operator's characteristics; and (4) of the workplace characteristics, crane height was the major contributor. Conclusion: The issues related to crane height and cabin feature can be fixed by providing engineering or foolproof solutions than relying on interventions related to the demographic factors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract There are a {{large number}} of {{multi-stage}} job-shop processes in production plants. Steel making process is also modeled as of a multi-stage job-shop process with crane handling. In the steel making process if there are two or more overhead <b>traveling</b> <b>cranes</b> for material handling in a house, it becomes very difficult to obtain in practice an optimal or near optimal solution under consideration of restrictions concerning crane interference caused between them as well as many restrictions for each facility in the house of production plant. In this paper, we first present a formulation of the scheduling problem taking account of the crane interference and then propose a heuristic algorithm to find a sub-optimal solution which starts at feasible solutions and solves the problem in a finite time. The algorithm is characterized by restricting search space and using hybrid method of depth-first search and width-first search on an enumeration tree for crane assignment. We also discuss an availability of this algorithm using a numerical simulation for a practical steel making process...|$|R
