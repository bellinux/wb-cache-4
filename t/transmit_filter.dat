An introduction of <b>transmit</b> <b>filter</b> can improve the system performance in terms of either PAPR or error probability. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} <b>transmit</b> <b>filter</b> aiming to reduce PAPR by employing the minimization of variance of instantaneous transmit power. Filter roll-off factor is also considered in order to provide excess-bandwidth transmission. With a combination of an FDE and spectrum combining at the receiver, excess-bandwidth transmission inherits additional frequency diversity gain, and therefore improves error probability. Performance evaluation of the proposed filtering algorithm is done by computer simulation, while the PAPR and bit-error rate (BER) performance of proposed algorithm are compared with conventional square-root Nyquist filter.
