5|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{tend to have}} a rich set of grammatical voices. Proto-Mayan had {{at least}} one passive construction as well as an antipassive rule for downplaying the importance of the agent in relation to the patient. Modern K'iche' has two antipassives: one which ascribes focus to the object and another <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> the verbal action. Other voice-related constructions occurring in Mayan languages are the following: mediopassive, incorporational (incorporating a direct object into the verb), instrumental (promoting the instrument to object position) and referential (a kind of applicative promoting an indirect argument such as a benefactive or recipient to the object position).|$|E

5|$|Python is {{a widely}} used {{high-level}} programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.|$|E
5|$|West Point is a medium-sized, highly {{residential}} baccalaureate college, with a full-time, four-year undergraduate program <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> {{instruction in}} the arts, sciences, and professions with no graduate program. There are forty-five academic majors, {{the most popular of}} which are foreign languages, management information systems, history, economics, and mechanical engineering. West Point is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. Military officers compose 75% of the faculty, while civilian professors make up the remaining 25%.|$|E
5|$|The ballet {{has been}} {{variously}} interpreted and adapted. The 1917 Russian film The Dying Swan by director Yevgeni Bauer, for example, {{tells the story}} of an artist who strangles a ballerina. Maya Plisetskaya re-interpreted the swan simply as elderly and stubbornly resisting the effects of aging, much like herself. Eventually the piece came to be considered one of Pavlova's trademarks. More recently, Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo perform a parody version <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> every excess dormant in the choreography, and, in 2000, street theatre artist Judith Lanigan created a hula hoop act based on the Fokine/Pavlova ballet divertissement that has been performed at international street theatre festivals, comedy and burlesque events, and in traditional and contemporary-style circuses.|$|E

Since about 1994, manufacturers have re-focused their advertising, moving from advertising functional bras <b>that</b> <b>emphasize</b> support and foundation, to selling lingerie <b>that</b> <b>emphasize</b> fashion while sacrificing basic fit and function, like linings under scratchy lace.|$|R

However, Pam consistently silences any attempt to bring up the device, saying she knows Dwight and is confident that he will stop the device on his own. After complimenting Dwight numerous times and having a small meal, Pam makes a joke <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> that everyone is human and makes mistakes.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> {{the ability to}} have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 1813, Alejandro Ramírez {{arrived to}} Puerto Rico and almost {{immediately}} {{was named to the}} office of Intendant, eventually establishing a Consulate of Commerce to control trade in Puerto Rico. Originally from Guatemala, where he had served in various political positions, Ramírez was {{also a member of the}} Philadelphia Philosophical Society. The Diario Económico de Puerto Rico, a newspaper specialized in the archipelago's economy, noted that during the time banknotes of all denominations were still being forged in large quantities. The publication claimed that the counterfeits were most likely produced in other locations of the Caribbean, this was based on the fact that only one royal press existed in Puerto Rico. However, modern researchers maintain that the copies could have been produced locally in a clandestine manner. This is based on a report <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> that the designs of false 8-real notes were crude and that the ink used spread when touched, something that wouldn't be possible if produced elsewhere, particularly because the ink would dry in the voyage between countries. During this time, paper notes began disappearing and the stated recurred to renewing old pieces.|$|E

5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} {{has become}} popular among poor Americans, {{particularly those who}} seek personal and social advancement. It has seen significant growth in black and Hispanic churches and is particularly popular among immigrants. Apologists for the movement note its ethnic diversity and argue that it encompasses a variety of views. Joel Robbins of Cambridge University notes that most anthropologists attribute the theology's appeal to the poor—especially in the Global South—to {{the fact that it}} promises security and helps explain capitalism. Simon Coleman developed a theory based on the doctrine's rhetoric and the feeling of belonging it gave parishioners. In a study of the Swedish Word of Life Church, he noted that members felt part of a complex gift-exchange system, giving to God and then awaiting a gift in return (either from God directly or through another church member). Hillsong Church, the largest congregation in Australia, teaches a form of prosperity theology <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> personal success. Marion Maddox has argued that this message has drawn a significant number of upwardly mobile Australians.|$|E
