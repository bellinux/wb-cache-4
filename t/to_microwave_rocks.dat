40|$|As {{humanity}} {{prepares to}} {{migrate to the}} frontiers of the Moon and other planets, the area of mining in space must go along {{for the purpose of}} exploration and in-situ resource utilization. In the present work the literature that has been developed over the years in the area of mining in space as applicable to Lunar and Martian environments is reviewed. Subsequently, the key mining technologies that are most suitable for Lunar and Martian environments are identified. From the literature review, it is concluded that an optimal combination of both mechanical methods and novel energy (lasers, microwaves, nuclear energy) methods for rock destruction drawing a trade off between the energy and mass would be the most ideal option for space applications. One such technique of applying low power <b>microwaves</b> <b>to</b> the <b>rocks</b> to thermally weaken them without actually melting them before employing mechanical methods of rock destruction is investigated. Finite element simulations were carried out <b>to</b> simulate <b>microwave</b> heating of a calcareous rock to determine the temperature profiles and thermal stresses at different microwave heating times and powers. Preliminary experiments were carried out in order <b>to</b> determine the <b>microwave</b> susceptibility of terrestrial basalt (which has similar composition as Lunar and Martian rocks). Temperature and strength of the rock sample before and after microwaving was measured. The results of the finite element simulation indicated that a calcareous <b>rock</b> with <b>microwave</b> responsive phase and a microwave non-responsive phase developed thermal stresses of large magnitudes exceeding the actual strength of the rock. The simulation methodology can be applied to other rock types as well, provided the thermal, electrical and structural properties of constituent mineral phases are available. The preliminary experimental results showed that the basalt rock specimens used were quite susceptible to the low power microwaves. There was a decreasing trend in terms of the point load index of the rock samples as the microwaving exposure times were increased, with some rock samples showing visible cracks at higher microwaving times...|$|R

We used a microwave generator with a horn antenna, at the 10. 75 GHz and a power density under 1 mWcm- 1. For a period of 8 days, the dynamics of the catalase and peroxidase activity were analyzed at 2 days, 4 days, 6 days and 8 days. The results showed that the microwaves determined variations of catalase and peroxidase activities depending on the age of the plants, time of exposure <b>to</b> <b>microwave</b> action and state of seeds (germinated and non germinated) exposed <b>to</b> <b>microwave...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in an attempt to characterize some of the effects of sublethal microwave radiation on cells of Staphylococcus aureus. Cultures were exposed <b>to</b> <b>microwave</b> radiation for 10, 20, 30, and 40 s. The effects of a conventional heat treatment were also compared by placing flasks containing cultures in a boiling water bath for the amount of time required to reach temperatures equivalent to those found in cultures exposed <b>to</b> <b>microwave</b> radiation. Control, microwave-treated, and conventionally heat-treated cultures were centrifuged, pellets were resuspended in distilled water, and the resulting suspensions were passed through a French pressure cell. Cell lysates and walls were then isolated and assayed for enzymatic activity. Thermonuclease production was also determined at various levels of exposure of cells <b>to</b> <b>microwave</b> radiation. Activities of malate and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenases, cytochrome oxidase, and cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphatase were higher in microwave-treated cells than in control cells. Membrane adenosine triphosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase activities were unaffected when cells were exposed <b>to</b> <b>microwave</b> radiation. The activity of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase was decreased by exposure of cells <b>to</b> <b>microwave</b> radiation. In conventionally heated cells, activities of glucose- 6 -phosphate and malate dehydrogenases and cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphatase increased activities of α-ketoglutarate and lactate dehydrogenases decreased, and alkaline phosphatase activity remained unaffected. Increased levels of thermonuclease activity were observed when cells were exposed <b>to</b> <b>microwave</b> radiation for 10 or 20 s. Data indicate that microwave radiation affects S. aureus in a manner which cannot be explained solely by thermal effects...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Microwaves produce various {{detrimental}} changes {{based on}} actions of heat or non-specific stress, although {{the effects of}} microwaves on pregnant organisms has not been uniform. This {{study was designed to}} clarify the effect of exposure <b>to</b> <b>microwaves</b> during pregnancy on endocrine and immune functions. METHODS: Natural killer cell activity and natural killer cell subsets in the spleen were measured, as well as some endocrine indicators in blood [...] corticosterone and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) as indices of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [...] beta-endorphin, oestradiol, and progesterone in six female virgin rats and six pregnant rats (nine to 11 days gestation) exposed <b>to</b> <b>microwaves</b> at 10 mW/cm 2 incident power density at 2450 MHz for 90 minutes. The same measurements were performed in control rats (six virgin and six pregnant rats). RESULTS: Skin temperature in virgin and pregnant rats increased immediately after exposure <b>to</b> <b>microwaves.</b> Although splenic activity of natural killer cells and any of the subset populations identified by the monoclonal antibodies CD 16 and CD 57 did not differ in virgin rats with or without exposure <b>to</b> <b>microwaves,</b> pregnant rats exposed <b>to</b> <b>microwaves</b> showed a significant reduction of splenic activity of natural killer cells and CD 16 +CD 57 -. Although corticosterone and ACTH increased, and oestradiol decreased in exposed virgin and pregnant rats, microwaves produced significant increases in beta-endorphin and progesterone only in pregnant rats. CONCLUSIONS: Microwaves at the power of 10 mW/cm 2 produced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and increased oestradiol in both virgin and pregnant rats, suggesting that microwaves greatly stress pregnant organisms. These findings in pregnant rats suggest that [...] with exposure <b>to</b> <b>microwaves</b> [...] pregnancy induces immunosuppression, which could result in successful maintainance of pregnancy. This enhancement of adaptability to heat stress with pregnancy may be mediated by activation of placental progesterone and placental or pituitary beta-endorphin...|$|R

40|$|<b>Microwave</b> heating leads <b>to</b> {{generation}} of an inverted temperature profile and provides selective heating within a ceramic. However, most ceramics are almost transparent <b>to</b> <b>microwaves</b> at room temperatures and frequencies reserved for industrial usage. With rising temperature, however, most ceramics became increasingly susceptible <b>to</b> <b>microwave</b> energy.

Time-temperature behaviour of alumina-zirconia-silica ceramics at different powers has also been studied. On-line load matching techniques using a six-port impedance analyser coupled to a motorised three-stub tuner, have been utilised to optimise power transmission and energy deposition rates <b>to</b> the material. <b>Microwave</b> joining trials of alumina-zirconia-silica and high-purity alumina ceramics have yielded joint strengths in excess of the base material strength. Moreover, impure interlayers between mating surfaces, which tend to decrease joint strengths, have been totally eliminated. These results are discussed in this paper...|$|R
