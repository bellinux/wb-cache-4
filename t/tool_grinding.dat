Aiming at {{the severe}} surface/subsurface damage of Al 2 O 3 ceramic ground by diamond {{grinding}} wheel, the chemical-mechanical <b>grinding</b> (CMG) <b>tools</b> were studied in this paper. According {{to the principle}} of CMG, three types of CMG tools with different abrasives were developed. The chemical compositions of the <b>grinding</b> <b>tools</b> were selected and optimized considering the physicochemical characteristics of Al 2 O 3 ceramic. By comparing the surface roughness and material removal rate (MRR) of Al 2 O 3 ceramic respectively ground with SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3 and MgO <b>grinding</b> <b>tools,</b> the <b>grinding</b> performance of those <b>grinding</b> <b>tools</b> were evaluated.

The surface roughness and MRR versus SiO 2 <b>grinding</b> <b>tool</b> were all better than other <b>grinding</b> <b>tools,</b> and can reach 28 nm and 15 µm/h respectively.

40|$|Abstract: At present, dry <b>tool</b> <b>grinding</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{discussed}} research topics in modern manufacturing technology. There are several developments for grinding wheels and methods for determining optimum grinding parameters which enable good surface properties to be obtained. Another potential to achieve better surface quality for dry grinding is the intentional change in process kinematics. This change makes it possible to carry out the task of cooling, namely lubrication of the contact area, and cooling and evacuation of the chips. This paper proposes innovative face-grinding kinematics in order to improve the surface properties for <b>tool</b> <b>grinding.</b> First, the principles of the new grinding kinematics are described and, second, a method for optimization of the process parameters is presented in order to assure the given surface requirements for the face grinding of inserts with high productivity...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: For {{achieving}} {{the goal of}} saving time on the <b>tool</b> <b>grinding</b> and design, an efficient method of developing the data management and searching system for the standard cutting tools is proposed in this study. Design/methodology/approach: At first the <b>tool</b> <b>grinding</b> software with open architecture was employed to design and plan grinding processes for seven types of tools. According to the characteristics of tools (e. g. types, diameter, radius and so on), 4802 tool data were established in the relational database. Then, the SQL syntax was utilized to write the searching algorithms, and the human machine interfaces of the searching system for the tool database were developed by C++ Builder. Findings: For grinding a square end mill with two-flute, a half {{of time on the}} tool design and the change of production line for grinding other types of tools can be saved by means of our system. More specifically, the efficiency in terms of the approach and retract time was improved up to 40 %, and an improvement of approximately 10. 6 % in the overall machining time can be achieved. Research limitations/implications: In fact, the used tool database in this study only includes some specific tools such as the square end mill. The step drill, taper tools, and special tools can also be taken into account in the database for future research. Practical implications: The most commercial <b>tool</b> <b>grinding</b> software is the modular-based design and use tool shapes to construct the CAM interface. Some limitations on the tool design are undesirable for customers. On the contrary, employing not only the grinding processes to construct the grinding path of tools but the searching system combined with the grinding software, it gives more flexible for one to design new tools. Originality/value: A novel tool database and searching system is presented for <b>tool</b> <b>grinding.</b> Using this system can save time and provide more convenience on designing tools and grinding.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to analyse the {{grinding}} processes and develop a search system of database for cutting tools.

According to the characteristics of these tools, 20270 data were established in the relational database. The SQL syntax was then utilized for writing the search algorithm, and the C++ Builder was employed for designing human machine interfaces of the search system of the tool database. Findings: A half of time on the tool design and the change of production line for grinding other types of tools can be saved by means of the proposed system. More specifically, the efficiency in terms of the overall machining time was improved up to 10. 58 %, 9. 36 %, 4. 64 %, and 7. 52 % for grinding the radius end mill, tapered radius end mill, twist drill, and step drill, respectively. Research limitations/implications: Special tools have diversification. They can not be taken into consideration in the database system owing to the tools have specific profiles.

5000|$|Grinding: Grinding or finish-machining {{creates the}} final {{form and the}} surface finish of the cavity in the mould insert. Usually, the finish is carried out by grinding; a {{subsequent}} polishing step is optionally required. Finish grinding can require several changes of the <b>grinding</b> <b>tool</b> and several truing steps of the tool. Finish-machining of the mould is an iterative process: As long as the machined mould shows deviations from the nominal contour in the measurement step after grinding, {{it has to be}} reground. There is no well-defined border between pre-machining and fine grinding. Throughout the grinding process of the cavity, the grain size of the tool, the feed rate and the cutting depth are reduced whereas machining time increases. Convex surfaces are easier to manufacture. The necessary steps of workpiece preparation are the mould alignment and the mould referencing. <b>Grinding</b> <b>tool</b> alignment, <b>grinding</b> <b>tool</b> referencing and <b>grinding</b> <b>tool</b> truing also have to be done. After that polishing can be necessary to remove the anisotropic structure which remains after grinding. It can be performed manually or by a CNC-machine.|$|R

An essential preliminary to all these experiments in turning, milling, drilling, tapping, etc., was accurate control of tool shapes.
