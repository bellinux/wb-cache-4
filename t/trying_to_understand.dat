5|$|Veltmann {{denied that}} there was a mutinous conspiracy, saying the men were {{in a state of shock}} {{stemming}} from the horrific explosion and the subsequent cleanup of human body parts belonging to their former battalion mates. He said the conversations at Camp Shoemaker were simply those of men who were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what had happened, and that these discussions were not mutinous nor could they provide the groundwork for conspiracy. Veltmann argued that Small's brief four- or five-minute speech to the men on the barge was given in the performance of his duty to maintain order, a duty placed upon him by his superiors. Veltmann restated that the established legal definition of mutiny was a concerted effort to usurp, subvert or override military authority, and that there had been no such action or intent. Refusal to obey an order was not mutiny.|$|E

5|$|Leon Czolgosz {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, in 1873, the son of Polish immigrants. The Czolgosz family moved several times as Paul Czolgosz, Leon's father, sought work {{throughout}} the Midwest. As an adult, Leon Czolgosz worked in a Cleveland factory until {{he lost his job}} in a labor dispute in 1893. Thereafter, he worked irregularly and attended political and religious meetings, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the reasons for the economic turmoil of the Panic of 1893. In so doing, he became interested in anarchism. By 1901, this movement was feared in the United States—New York's highest court had ruled that the act of identifying oneself as an anarchist {{in front of an audience}} was a breach of the peace. Anarchists had taken a toll in Europe by assassinating or attempting assassinations of a half-dozen officials and members of royal houses, and had been blamed for the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago.|$|E

25|$|The {{new style}} in English poetry during the 17th century {{was that of}} the metaphysical movement. The metaphysical poets were John Donne, George Herbert, Andrew Marvell and others. Metaphysical poetry is characterised by a spirit of {{intellectual}} investigation of the spiritual, rather than the mystical reverence of many earlier English poems. The metaphysical poets were clearly <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the world around them and the spirit behind it, instead of accepting dogma on the basis of faith.|$|E

25|$|The {{engineering}} {{problems associated}} with leaving Earth and developing space propulsion systems have been examined for over a century, and millions of man-hours of research have been spent on them. In recent {{years there has been}} an increase in research on the issue of how humans can survive and work in space for extended and possibly indefinite periods of time. This question requires input from the physical and biological sciences and has now become the greatest challenge (other than funding) facing human space exploration. A fundamental step in overcoming this challenge is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the effects and impact of long-term space travel on the human body.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{scientific}} {{studies have found}} lateralization of emotions. FMRI and lesion studies have shown asymmetrical activation of brain regions while thinking of emotions, responding to extreme emotional stimuli, and viewing emotional situations. Processing and production of facial expressions also appear to be asymmetric in nature. Many theories of lateralization have been proposed {{and some of those}} specific to emotions. Please keep in mind that most of the information in this article is theoretical and scientists are still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> emotion and emotional lateralization. Also, some of the evidence is contradictory. Many brain regions are interconnected and the input and output of any given region may come from and go to many different regions.|$|E

This version {{was the only one}} allowed in open discourse in the country. After Suharto's removal from power, many people, including those involved, told other versions of the events in various books and films. One, the documentary film The Act of Killing, included interviews with individuals who had participated in the mass killings, and its companion piece The Look of Silence follows one grieving family <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why it happened and exposes how those behind the Indonesian massacres still revel in their crimes 50 years on, including boasting on camera how they dismembered, eviscerated, castrated and beheaded alleged communists.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} explosion, the {{aircraft}} banked {{hard to the}} right, but the autopilot quickly corrected the bank. After the blast, Captain Reyes asked Systems Engineer Dexter Comendador to survey the blast site to check for damage. Reyes placed the Mayday call, requesting landing at Naha Airport, Okinawa Island, Okinawa Prefecture. The Japanese air traffic controller experienced difficulty in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Reyes' request, so an American air traffic controller from a United States military base on Okinawa took over and processed Reyes' landing. The American air traffic controller directed a USAF Lear jet towards PAL 434 to visually check for damage of the outer fuselage and to verify that the landing gear was in place. The autopilot had stopped responding to Reyes' commands and the aircraft flew past Okinawa.|$|E
25|$|Heidegger {{theorized that}} Dasein exists {{as an agent}} who is always-already engaged in a world with other human beings. Charles Taylor built on Heidegger's work {{when he talked about}} engaged agency, or the idea that Dasein is an agent inescapably engaged in his world. What Heidegger, and later Taylor, are saying is that that world is {{constantly}} “there-for-us” to experience prior to any abstract, disengaged scientific theorizing, and this is where hermeneutics starts to deviate from mainstream psychological and personality theories. In other words, Dasein (a person) does not need to scientifically analyze human interaction to take part in it. All he needs to do is observe human interaction, interpret what those observations mean for him, and then participate accordingly. Heidegger termed this description as being-in-the-world, i.e. human beings exist in the world as active participants who are so deeply immersed that their world around them becomes utterly inescapable, especially when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> themselves.|$|E
