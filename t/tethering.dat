50|$|<b>Tethers</b> may break {{by various}} means; if a <b>tether</b> is a signal, then {{interruption}} by signal barriers breaks the <b>tether.</b> If the <b>tether</b> is a cord or rope, then upon reaching the breaking {{strength of the}} <b>tether,</b> the <b>tether</b> fails in its function. Failure modes for <b>tethers</b> are considered when designing arrangements where a <b>tether</b> is needed. When a <b>tether</b> or line breaks suddenly, backlash of the segments may cause severe damage or loss of life. Safety links are sometimes used to prevent excessive tension in a <b>tether</b> involved in towing objects or persons, like in the towing of sailplanes; the safety link in a <b>tether</b> is thus a <b>tether</b> itself.|$|R

5|$|Beyond: Two Souls is an {{interactive}} drama action-adventure game, requiring the player {{to move and}} guide the character into interactions with objects and other non-player characters in the scene to progress the story. The player primarily controls Jodie through the in-game environments. At almost any time, however, the player (or second player during a two-player game) can switch to control Aiden instead. Aiden, as an incorporeal entity, exists permanently in noclip mode and can move through walls, ceilings, and other obstacles; however, he is limited to moving only within a certain radius around Jodie due to their spiritual <b>tethering.</b>|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Knuckles' Chaotix, both {{contemporary and}} in retrospect, has been mixed. Critics found the partner mechanic and <b>tethering</b> physics to be cumbersome, although many journalists appreciated Sega's attempt to innovate the series. The level design was also cited as poor by multiple publications. The game {{has been considered}} the last classic game of the Sonic series and a declining point. Some characters and concepts introduced in Knuckles' Chaotix were later featured in other Sonic games and media.

5|$|Such {{trafficking}} capacity {{depends on}} the MAM, which {{has been shown to}} facilitate transfer of lipid intermediates between organelles. In contrast to the standard vesicular mechanism of lipid transfer, evidence indicates that the physical proximity of the ER and mitochondrial membranes at the MAM allows for lipid flipping between opposed bilayers. Despite this unusual and seemingly energetically unfavorable mechanism, such transport does not require ATP. Instead, in yeast, it {{has been shown to be}} dependent on a multiprotein <b>tethering</b> structure termed the ER-mitochondria encounter structure, or ERMES, although it remains unclear whether this structure directly mediates lipid transfer or is required to keep the membranes in sufficiently close proximity to lower the energy barrier for lipid flipping.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Origins {{is an open}} world action-adventure game {{incorporating}} stealth game tactics. Batman can use his cape {{to glide}} around Gotham City and the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to hard-to-reach ledges and extend his flight. Some gadgets from previous Arkham games are present {{at the start of}} Arkham Origins, while others become available during play. Returning gadgets include the Cryptographic Sequencer, used to hack security consoles; the Batclaw, used for hooking onto surfaces; the Batarang, a throwing weapon; the Remote Batarang, its remote-controlled counterpart; Explosive Gel, used to destroy weak surfaces and knock down enemies; Smoke Pellets, used for stealthy exits and entrances; the Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines, and the Grapnel Accelerator, an earlier version of the Grapnel Boost. New equipment in Batman's arsenal include the Remote Claw; this allows Batman to target two objects and pull them together, allowing him to throw enemies into each other or hit them with objects (<b>tethering</b> two walled points creates a tightrope for Batman to cross); Shock Gloves, which allow Batman to block electric attacks, disable some enemies and stun shielded ones, and short-circuit objects, and the Concussion Detonator, capable of stunning large enemy groups.|$|E
5|$|Development of Knuckles' Chaotix {{began in}} 1994 as an {{internal}} Sega engine test called Sonic Crackers for the Sega Genesis. Contrary to popular belief, this game (and ultimately Knuckles' Chaotix) were not developed by Sonic Team, but rather another internal development team at Sega. This team—which consisted of directors Masahide Kobayashi, Atsuhiko Nakamura, Naohisa Nakazawa, producers Hiroshi Aso, Makoto Oshitani, Mike Larsen, and artist Takumi Miyakewas—was assembled from young {{members of the}} staff who worked on Sonic CD (1993). Sonic Crackers featured Sonic and Tails joined together by a band of rings with an elastic nature. Although never released, the prototype's core <b>tethering</b> gameplay provided the foundation for Knuckles' Chaotix. The prototype ROM image has since leaked on the Internet and can be played {{with the use of}} emulators. Development was eventually transitioned to the 32X. Rather than featuring Sonic, the new game centered around a group of supporting characters led by Knuckles the Echidna, and the project was given the title Knuckles' Ringstar, later renamed Knuckles' Chaotix.|$|E
40|$|NASA {{research}} {{concerning the}} use of <b>tethers</b> in space is reviewed, including joint research with the Italian Space Agency. <b>Tether</b> applications under consideration are described, such as a <b>tethered</b> fuel depot and a <b>tethered</b> gravity laboratory platform for the Space Station, providing artificial gravity to and from Mars, payload recovery and waste management, aerothermodynamic magnetospheric physics, and electrodynamic propulsion, braking, and power generation for the Space Shuttle.

5|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the identification of}} the tethers between the mitochondrial and ER membranes suggest that the scaffolding function of the molecular elements involved is secondary to other, non-structural functions. In yeast, ERMES, a multiprotein complex of interacting ER- and mitochondrial-resident membrane proteins, is required for lipid transfer at the MAM and exemplifies this principle. One of its components, for example, is also a constituent of the protein complex required for insertion of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins into the lipid bilayer. However, a homologue of the ERMES complex has not yet been identified in mammalian cells. Other proteins implicated in scaffolding likewise have functions independent of structural <b>tethering</b> at the MAM; for example, ER-resident and mitochondrial-resident mitofusins form heterocomplexes that regulate the number of inter-organelle contact sites, although mitofusins were first identified for their role in fission and fusion events between individual mitochondria. Glucose-related protein 75 (grp75) is another dual-function protein. In addition to the matrix pool of grp75, a portion serves as a chaperone that physically links the mitochondrial and ER Ca2+ channels VDAC and IP3R for efficient Ca2+ transmission at the MAM. Another potential tether is Sigma-1R, a non-opioid receptor whose stabilization of ER-resident IP3R may preserve communication at the MAM during the metabolic stress response.|$|E

25|$|A {{recent report}} {{has shown that}} the initial {{interaction}} between TRAPP and the ER derived vesicle is mediated via the interaction between the TRAPP subunit Bet3 and the COPII coat subunit, Sec23. The conventional view of tethering/fusion assumed that the vesicle coat is shed prior to <b>tethering</b> and fusion but this report argues for a model where the initial <b>tethering</b> step takes place on a coated or partially coated vesicle. The TRAPPI complex minus the subunit Trs85 was recently crystallized as two subcomplexes that were then modelled on EM etch data to reveal a possible crystal structure for the entire complex. A putative ypt/rab binding site was indicated on the crystal structure involving the subunits Trs23 and Bet5. Incidentally, all 5 essential small subunits (Trs31, Trs20, Bet3, Bet5 and Trs23) are required to reconstitute efficient exchange activity on ypt1 in vitro. Therefore, {{it remains to be seen}} whether the interface between ypt1 and TRAPPI is only confined to Trs23 and Bet5 and how the other subunit influence exchange activity.|$|E

Similarly, the hepatic flexure is formed between the right mesocolon and transverse mesocolon at the mesenteric confluence. The colonic component of the hepatic flexure is draped around this mesenteric confluence. Furthermore, the splenic flexure is formed by the mesenteric confluence between the transverse and left mesocolon. The colonic component of the splenic flexure occurs lateral to the mesenteric confluence.

Types of substrate attachments include mussels' <b>tethering</b> byssal threads and glues, sea stars' thousands of suctioning tube feet, and isopods' hook-like appendages that help them hold on to intertidal kelps. Higher profile organisms, such as kelps, must also avoid breaking in high flow locations, and they do so with their strength and flexibility. Finally, organisms can also avoid high flow environments, such as by seeking out low flow microhabitats. Additional forms of mechanical stresses include ice and sand scour, as well as dislodgment by water-borne rocks, logs, etc.|$|E
