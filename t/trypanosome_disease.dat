Although various species show evidence of clinical tolerance to trypanosomes, until now {{there has been}} no evidence of acquired immunity to natural infections. We discovered a distinct peak and decrease in age prevalence of T. brucei s. l. infection in wild African lions that is consistent with being driven by an exposure-dependent increase in cross-immunity following infections with the more genetically diverse species, T. congolense sensu latu. The causative agent of human sleeping sickness, T. brucei rhodesiense, disappears by 6 years of age apparently in response to cross-immunity from other trypanosomes, including the nonpathogenic subspecies, T. brucei brucei. These findings may suggest novel pathways for vaccinations against trypanosomiasis despite the notoriously complex antigenic surface proteins in these parasites...|$|R

40|$|African <b>trypanosomes</b> cause <b>disease</b> {{in humans}} and livestock, {{generating}} significant {{health and welfare}} problems throughout sub-Saharan Africa. When ingested in a tsetse fly bloodmeal, trypanosomes must detect their new environment and initiate the developmental responses that ensure transmission. The best-established environmental signal is citrate/cis aconitate (CCA), this being transmitted through a protein phosphorylation cascade involving two phosphatases: one that inhibits differentiation (TbPTP 1) and one that activates differentiation (TbPIP 39). Other cues have been also proposed (mild acid, trypsin exposure, glucose depletion) but their physiological relevance and relationship to TbPTP 1 /TbPIP 39 signalling is unknown. Here we demonstrate that mild acid and CCA operate through TbPIP 39 phosphorylation, whereas trypsin attack of the parasite surface uses an alternative pathway that is dispensable in tsetse flies. Surprisingly, glucose depletion is not an important signal. Mechanistic analysis through biophysical methods suggests that citrate promotes differentiation by causing TbPTP 1 and TbPIP 39 to interact...|$|R

40|$|Following an {{outbreak}} of trypanosomosis in horses {{on a farm in}} Kenya, 18 trypanosome isolates were collected from the infected animals over a period of one and a half years and cryopreserved for characterization. The characterization was done on the basis of morphology using Giemsa-stained blood and buffy coat smears, infectivity to mice, recombinant DNA hybridization, and chromosome separation by orthogonal field alternation gel electrophoresis (OFAGE). Morphologically, all the trypanosome isolates were identified as belonging to the subgenus Nannomonas, and a total of 16 out of the 18 isolates grew in mice. Using the recombinant DNA hybridization technique, the isolates were further classified as the 'savannah' type of Trypanosoma congolense. Furthermore, chromosome separation by OFAGE, carried out on six clones derived from different isolates, exhibited a profile characteristic of T. congolense, 'savannah' type. However, there were differences in the number and positions of the medium-sized and minichromosomes indicating a diversity of serodemes within the isolates.

Therefore, investigations for novel disease control strategies are urgently needed. Previous analyses showed the association between the presence of Glossina symbiont, Sodalis glossinidius, and the fly infection by trypanosomes in a south-western region in Cameroon: flies harbouring symbionts had a threefold higher probability of being infected by trypanosomes than flies devoid of symbionts. But the study also showed substantial differences in S. glossinidius and trypanosome infection rates between Glossina populations from two Cameroonian foci of sleeping sickness. We hypothesized that the geographical isolation of the two foci may have induced the independent evolution of each one, leading to the diversification of symbiont genotypes. Microsatellite markers were used and showed that genetic diversity structuring of S. glossinidius varies at different geographical scales with a low but significant differentiation between the Campo and Bipindi HAT foci.

40|$|Several {{species of}} African <b>{{trypanosome}}s</b> cause fatal <b>disease</b> in livestock, but most cannot infect humans due to innate trypanosome lytic factors (TLFs). Human TLFs are pore forming high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles that contain apolipoprotein L-I (apoL-I) the trypanolytic component, and haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr), which binds free hemoglobin (Hb) {{in blood and}} facilitates the uptake of TLF via a trypanosome haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor. The human-infective Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense escapes lysis by TLF by expression of serum resistance-associated (SRA) protein, which binds and neutralizes apoL-I. Unlike humans, baboons are not susceptible to infection by T. b. rhodesiense due to previously unidentified serum factors. Here, we show that baboons have a TLF complex that contains orthologs of Hpr and apoL-I and that full-length baboon apoL-I confers trypanolytic activity to mice and when expressed together with baboon Hpr and human apoA-I, provides protection against both animal infective and the human-infective T. brucei rhodesiense in vivo. We further define two critical lysines near the C terminus of baboon apoL- 1 that are necessary and sufficient to prevent binding to SRA and thereby confer resistance to human-infective trypanosomes. These findings {{form the basis for}} the creation of TLF transgenic livestock that would be resistant to animal and human-infective trypanosomes, which would result in the reduction of disease and the zoonotic transmission of human infective trypanosomes...|$|R

Suppression of cellular immune responses is {{a feature of}} trypanosomiasis in bovine, human, and murine hosts. Some aspects of immunosuppression in the murine model are mediated by nitric oxide (NO) produced by gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) -activated macrophages. We have investigated whether a similar mechanism is responsibe for T-cell unresponsiveness in bovine trypanosomiasis. Bovine monocytes and macrophages from uninfected cattle and activated in vitro with IFN-gamma produced NO; however, this response was down-regulated in infected cattle. Similarly, the expression of inducible NO synthase messenger RNA was depressed in macrophages of infected cattle. Proliferation of mononuclear cells of trypanosome infected cattle cultured with mitogen or trypanosome antigens was unchanged {{by the addition of}} an NO synthase inhibitor. Lymphocytes of infected cattle secreted interleukins with T-cell growth factor activity after in vitro activation with mitogens but not after activation with trypanosome antigens. Although lymph node cells secreted IFN-gamma after in vitro activation, ex vivo expression of mRNA was depressed. In contrast, the level of expression of interleukin 10 mRNA was higher during infection. We conclude that NO is not involved in the loss of T-cell proliferative function associated with trypanosomiasis in cattle and that, in contrast to the mouse model, the capacity of monocytes and macrophages to produce NO is actually down-regulated in infected cattle...|$|R

An experiment in mice shows that QTL introgression is feasible and successful, and that the background genotype is an important factor to be considered when analyzing the results of such an experiment. This experiment is unique. The general discussion focuses on the introgression of trypanotolerance genes in cattle with an emphasis on SubSaharan zones of Africa.

40|$|Treatment {{for human}} African trypanosomiasis is {{dependent}} on the species of <b>trypanosome</b> causing the <b>disease</b> and the stage of the disease (stage 1 defined by parasites being present in blood and lymphatics whilst for stage 2, parasites are found beyond the blood-brain barrier in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)). Currently, staging relies upon detecting the very low number of parasites or elevated white blood cell numbers in CSF. Improved staging is desirable, as is the elimination of the need for lumbar puncture. Here we use metabolomics to probe samples of CSF, plasma and urine from 40 Angolan patients infected with Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, at different disease stages. Urine samples provided no robust markers indicative of infection or stage of infection due to inherent variability in urine concentrations. Biomarkers in CSF were able to distinguish patients at stage 1 or advanced stage 2 with absolute specificity. Eleven metabolites clearly distinguished the stage in most patients and two of these (neopterin and 5 -hydroxytryptophan) showed 100 % specificity and sensitivity between our stage 1 and advanced stage 2 samples. Neopterin is an inflammatory biomarker previously shown in CSF of stage 2 but not stage 1 patients. 5 -hydroxytryptophan is an important metabolite in the serotonin synthetic pathway, the key pathway in determining somnolence, thus offering a possible link to the eponymous symptoms of "sleeping sickness". Plasma also yielded several biomarkers clearly indicative of the presence (87 % sensitivity and 95 % specificity) and stage of disease (92 % sensitivity and 81 % specificity).

40|$|Background: There {{are three}} {{subspecies}} of Trypanosoma brucei : T. b. gambiense, T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. brucei. The first two are infectious to humans, whilst T. b. brucei is not. Identifying an animal model of T. b. brucei that mimics human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) would enable researchers to study HAT without subjecting themselves to undue risks such as accidental infection. Objectives: This study assessed the sequential clinical, parasitological and haematological changes in vervet monkeys infected with  T. b. brucei. Methods: Three vervet monkeys were infected with a 10 4 inoculum of  T. b. brucei (isolate GUTat 1). Late-stage disease was induced by subcurative treatment with diminazene aceturate 28 days post-infection. The animals were treated curatively with melarsoprol upon relapse. Parasitaemia and clinical signs were monitored daily and, at weekly intervals, the monkeys’ blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were sampled for haematology and parasitosis assessments, respectively. Results: The first-peak parasitaemia was observed between seven and nine days post-infection. Clinical signs {{associated with the}} disease included fever, dullness, pallor of mucous membranes, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and oedema. Late-stage signs included stiffness of joints and lethargy. The monkeys developed a disease associated with microcytic hypochromic anaemia. There was an initial decline, followed by an increase, in total {{white blood cell counts}} from early- to late-stage <b>disease.</b> <b>Trypanosomes</b> were detected in the CSF and there was a significant increase in white cell counts in the CSF during late-stage disease.

40|$|Abstract Background The tsetse-transmitted African <b>trypanosomes</b> cause <b>diseases</b> of {{importance}} {{to the health of}} both humans and livestock. The life cycles of these trypanosomes in the fly were described in the last century, but comparatively few details are available for Trypanosoma (Nannomonas) congolense, {{despite the fact that it}} is probably the most prevalent and widespread pathogenic species for livestock in tropical Africa. When the fly takes up bloodstream form trypanosomes, the initial establishment of midgut infection and invasion of the proventriculus is much the same in T. congolense and T. brucei. However, the developmental pathways subsequently diverge, with production of infective metacyclics in the proboscis for T. congolense and in the salivary glands for T. brucei. Whereas events during migration from the proventriculus are understood for T. brucei, knowledge of the corresponding developmental pathway in T. congolense is rudimentary. The recent publication of the genome sequence makes it timely to re-investigate the life cycle of T. congolense. Methods Experimental tsetse flies were fed an initial bloodmeal containing T. congolense strain 1 / 148 and dissected 2 to 78 days later. Trypanosomes recovered from the midgut, proventriculus, proboscis and cibarium were fixed and stained for digital image analysis. Trypanosomes contained in spit samples from individually caged flies were analysed similarly. Mensural data from individual trypanosomes were subjected to principal components analysis. Results Flies were more susceptible to infection with T. congolense than T. brucei; a high proportion of flies infected with T. congolense established a midgut and subsequent proboscis infection, whereas many T. brucei infections were lost in the migration from foregut to salivary glands. In T. congolense, trypomastigotes ceased division in the proventriculus and became uniform in size. The trypanosomes retained trypomastigote morphology during migration via the foregut to the mouthparts and we confirmed that the trypomastigote-epimastigote transition occurred in the proboscis. We found no equivalent to the asymmetric division stage in T. brucei that mediates transition of proventricular trypomastigotes to epimastigotes. In T. congolense extremely long epimastigotes with remarkably elongated posterior ends were observed in both the proboscis and cibarium; no difference was found in the developmental stages in these two organs. Dividing trypomastigotes and epimastigotes were recovered from the proboscis, some of which were in transition from trypomastigote to epimastigote and vice versa. It remains uncertain whether these morphological transitions are mediated by cell division, since we also found non-dividing cells with a variously positioned, juxta-nuclear kinetoplast. Conclusions We have presented a detailed description of the life cycle of T. congolense in its tsetse fly vector. During development in the fly T. congolense shares a common migratory pathway with its close relative T. brucei, culminating in the production of small metacyclic trypanosomes that can be inoculated with the saliva. Despite this outward similarity in life cycle, the transitional developmental stages in the foregut and mouthparts are remarkably different in the two trypanosome species. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAfrican trypanosomiases are vector-borne {{diseases}} {{of human and}} their livestock, with devastating socio-economical consequences for the Sub-Saharan African continent. These diseases are caused by flagellated unicellular parasites named African trypanosomes that are almost exclusively transmitted by the bite of tsetse flies. Here, {{both male and female}} tsetse flies are obligatory blood feeders able to carry and transmit trypanosomes during their entire life span. Two species of African trypanosomes are responsible for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness: Trypanosoma brucei gambiense in Central/West Africa and T. b. rhodesiense in East/Southern Africa. The T. b. gambiense transmission cycle is mostly from human to human with an occasional involvement of an animal reservoir. The T. b. rhodesiense transmission cycle mainly involves wild and domestic animals, but intensified human-to-human transmission may occur during epidemics. There are no prophylactic drugs or vaccines available to prevent HAT and the few available treatments present a complex posology and severe side effects (Fevre et al., 2006; Brun et al., 2009). In 2011, less than 10, 000 new cases were reported (Simarro et al., 2012), with many more cases probably remaining undetected as sleeping sickness occurs in remote rural areas. It is estimated that approximately 70 million people within tsetse-fly infested areas are at different levels of risk of contracting HAT, especially in countries as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, South-Sudan, and the Central African Republic (Simarro et al., 2012; WHO, 2012). In addition to their importance in public health, at least seven other species of African <b>trypanosomes</b> cause severe <b>disease</b> in livestock known as African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) or nagana. T. vivax and T. con-golense are the major pathogens of cattle and other ruminants, while T. simiae, T. godfreyi, and T. suis causes high mortality in domestic pigs. Animal African Trypanosomiasis restricts agricultural development on the African continent despite the availability of prophylactic and curative drugs. Moreover, it is worrying to see drug effectiveness seriously threatened by an increasing resistance in animal trypanosomes (Delespaux et al., 2008). Successful transmission is primarily the outcome of a crosstalk between the trypanosomes and the tsetse fly vector. This enables the parasite to undergo successive rounds of differentiation, proliferation, and migration in different locations of the fly, resulting in a final infective stage that is transmitted to a new mammalian host during each tsetse fly blood-feeding event. This Research Topic hosted in Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology focuses on the state-of-the-art on some key aspects of the fascinating biological interplay between African trypanosomes and the tsetse fly. To prepare for life cycle progression, T. brucei parasites present in the bloodstream of an infected mammalian host have to generate stumpy forms that are pre-adapted to survive in the tsetse fly once they are taken up by the fly blood feeding. The molecular mechanisms that underpin the production of these stumpy forms and their signal perception pathways upon entry into the tsetse fly are detailed under the lights of recent discoveries in the review of Vidal et al., 2013. In the tsetse fly, trypanosomes have to go through specific developmental programs in order to survive and produce transmissible stage. Here, a mini-review will focus on the major advancements in our understanding of this trypanosome development in the tsetse fly (Rotureau and Van Den Abbeele, 2013). The different types of parasite cycle and the critical stages of the three epidemiologically most relevant try-panosome species, namely T. vivax, T. congolense and T. brucei will be compared. More emphasis is on T. brucei development since the parasite undergoes multiple morphological changes during the successive invasion of the tsetse alimentary tract to finally achieve the mammalian-infective stage in the salivary glands. Another review will attempt to elucidate how these morphological changes are possible for a parasite that has evolved a highly robust cell structure to survive the chemically and physically diverse environments in the fly (Ooi and Bastin, 2013). During their journey in the tsetse fly, trypanosomes are challenged by a robust innate defense system. This is reviewed in the paper of Haines (Haines, 2013) with a focus on the tissues intimately associated with host defense. Moreover, the established symbiotic associations of tsetse flies with bacterial and viral microorganisms also modulate its vector competence for trypanosomes. A first review article will provide {{a detailed description of the}} tsetse symbiotic microbiome, and describes the physiology underlying host-symbiont and symbiont-symbiont interactions that occur in this fly (Wang et al., 2013). The diversity of the gut bacterial flora in the tsetse fly and the possible impact of newly identified bacteria to the vector competence will also be discussed in mini-review of Geiger et al. (2013). In combination to the multiple trypanosome-tsetse crosstalk, environmental factors can also affect the parasite developmental barriers in the fly. Here, experimental work from Burkina Faso demonstrated that temperature stress could increase th...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{many years}} of baffle, the number one' problem facing {{livestock}} in Africa is still the indomitable tsetse fly. The limitations on raising livestock imposed by the typanosomiasis that it spreads pose increasing problems for African countries with growing meat demands. Pluridisciplinary research is now concentrating on eliminating or at least {{reducing the number of}} flies and on limiting their effect on animal health through the use of more resistant breeds. For livestock in Africa, life is no picnic. In fact, it is quite the opposite: although the green pastures are tempting, they are also home to the flies that kill. Unfortunately, those areas that are most favourable to livestock -those with lush pastures and abundant rainfall [...] are the most infected with tsetse flies. Of the ten million square kilometres that they inhabit, there are seven million km 2 of pasture zones that are practically out of bounds for zebra herds. This is a desperate situation for the many countries that must deal with large increases in their population and thus the production of meat. Those countries in the Sahel where livestock raising is traditional can no longer meet the needs of neighbouring countries. The deficit has also been increased by recent droughts and the disappearance of pastures in arid regions. Herders are being continually forced to move their animals south in the search for better grazing areas. But the large Sahelian zebus are threatened by this incursion into tsetse fly territory. Only the small beef bulls from Guinea and a few breeds of sheep and goats are resistant to trypanosomiasis. Losses of meat production attributed to this problem are estimated at FF 57 million per year. How is it that this disease, which has been known for so long, remains more than ever a problem? To understand, this problem, one must be familiar with the different strains of trypanosomiasis that are involved in what is more commonly known as 'sleeping sickness', a disease that also affects humans beings. The largest role is played by the smallest actor, the trypansome parasite that is responsible for the infection. It is a protozoan flagellate that invades the blood, Iymphs and various tissues. There are many species, but three of them are particularly dangerous for livestock in Africa The disease is transmitted to animals through a vector, which is commonly the tsetse fly or flies as there are more than 30 species or sub-species. These humming insects are brown flies that prefer shady and humid areas where the temperature is never too high: savanna thickets, forests or forested paths, and banks of rivers or lakes. It is by biting the animals that the fly injects the trypanosomes that will gradually contaminate them entirely. In its advanced form, 'Nagana' (the name given by some herders for this disease) is mortal to cattle. But even chronic, low-level infections are serious because they can result in high rates of abortion, mortality of young animals, weight loss, reduction of milk production, and a lowering of stamina which makes such animals useless for draught work. But infected animals are not completely innocent victims. Once infected, they constitute trypanosome reservoirs which, in turn, infect the flies that feed on them. It is thus a vicious circle that links the animal to the vector and the vector to the animal. To break it, all fronts must be tackled at once or one of the vectors must be completely eliminated. To get rid of all of the infected animals is impossible because even though wild animals are resistant to trypanosomiasis they still act as hosts. Priority has thus been given {{for a long time to}} controlling tsetse fly populations. The emphasis is now on integrated pest management that, according to the variety of situations encountered, includes different techniques that have proven their effectiveness. Pluridisciplinary research involving entomologists, geneticists, wildlife specialists and veterinarians is proving indispensable for developing appropriate methods that take into consideration all factors. Reducing fly populations Tsetse fly traps are being used increasingly as one way to reduce numbers. Different models and screens have been developed by teams at ORSTOM (the French development research agency) and IEMVT/GTZ (the French tropical veterinary medicine institute /and the German development research agency) for use in both West and Central Africa. The oldest is the bi-conical model in blue tissue with black screens, colours that attract tsetse flies. It allows their captors to use the insects for scientific studies or to destroy them if it is used with insecticide, generally a pyrethrum of low toxicity to mammals. Black and blue mono-conic traps have recently been successfully tested; they are more effective in the dry season and are less expensive. Pyramid traps commonly used in East Africa have also been tested with favourable results. Screens are easier to make than traps and can produce the same results. Thousands are now being used in many regions of Africa. They are made from blue cotton or black and blue polyester and cotton, and are fixed or pivoting according to the region and the species of tsetse to catch Not all tsetse flies behave alike, of course, so detailed studies are needed to determine the best equipment to be used in each situation. To increase the effectiveness of these techniques, olfactory products are currently being tested. Octenol, acetone and some phenols made from cattle secretions and excretions seem to be good attractors for savanna species in both Zimbabwe and West Africa. Research is also being done on sex pheromones but field tests have only just begun. The results obtained from these environmentally safe techniques are undeniable. But the installation and periodic recharge of insecticide in the traps pose costly, logistic problems. Theft and damage are also contra-indications to their use in certain regions and countries. Their effectiveness is also limited during the rainy season because the water washes away the insecticide. Such traps are thus often used in conjunction with other techniques, notably to reinforce and prolong the action of ground or aerial application of insecticides, a more expensive technique that is difficult to repeat often. The association of two techniques that has given the most spectacular results is that achieved by CRTA (the Centre for Research on Animal Trypanosomiasis) in Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, which is working in collaboration with IEMVT and GTZ. Combined with traps, the release of sterile males is a good 'finishing' touch that enables the near elimination of those females that escape from traps. The objectives of this research centre are directed both towards the vector (the tsetse flies) and the parasites responsible for the <b>disease</b> (<b>trypanosome)</b> through the use of ecologically acceptable methods (sterile males, traps, trypanotolerant species). Two characteristics of the tsetse fly reproduction system facilitate their biological control. The females mate only once or a small number of times at the beginning of their adult lives and conserve in their seminal receptacles the sperm that will fertilize their eggs throughout their entire reproductive life. The male reservoir of sperm is also constituted only once during the pupa stage. It is thus possible to sterilize these males by irradiating them with Gamma rays that disrupt their chromosome cells. By releasing large numbers of sterile males over a long enough period, the reproduction of tsetse flies can be reduced. To implement programmes covering vast areas, CRTA has developed techniques to reproduce tsetse flies in laboratories. Female flies are fed with blood from local abattoirs. The males, separated from the females and anaesthetized, are irradiated before being released in zones where traps installed during the dry season have already reduced the number of flies. In two years, 3, 500 km 2 of pasture zone have been totally freed of tsetse flies in Burkina Faso. Vigilance must of course be maintained, and isolation barriers established through the use of traps and screens to prevent re-invasion of these areas. After the success of these programmes, similar campaigns are being planned for Ethiopia and northwest Ghana. Nigeria has also been trying for several years to launch a massive tsetse fly control programme. It is likely that CRTA will soon see its activities develop beyond the boundaries of Burkina Faso by making its equipment and expertise available to neighbouring countries joining the battle against trypanosomiasis. Treating trypano In areas where the fight against tsetse flies is less well organized, the use of medicines to treat livestock or to prevent the appearance of the disease is the only solution available. Whether curative or preventative, these trypanocides or trypanopreventers are widely used when tsetse fly populations are not too high and when a limited number of treatments is enough to maintain livestock in good health. But when dealing with high levels of fly populations they become too expensive for herders. Their systematic or improper use can also build resistance as there have not been new trypanocides on the market for more than 25 years. These are also used in some special cases such as the transportation of animals through infested areas, the use of draught animals or for areas in which integrated pest management programmes have not yet been implemented. For these reasons, the use of trypanocides became indispensable in Ethiopia for the settlement of refugees in the eastern part of the country. Other techniques to protect cattle are also being tested, and include a dressing applied to the back of the animal as well as ear-rings impregnated with pesticide that protect their entire body. These methods have already been used against ticks and other flies and thus show promise for the control of tsetse. Baths in pyrethrum insecticides repeated|$|R
