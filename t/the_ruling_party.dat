5|$|Finally, {{where an}} MP of <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>party</b> vacates {{his or her}} seat, a {{counterpart}} in a neighbouring ward may take over his or her functions, thus {{eliminating the need for}} a by-election. However, this arrangement may not work if an opposition MP vacates his or her seat and no by-election is called, because of the dearth of opposition MPs in Parliament. Therefore, the voters in the opposition ward will be denied of representation until the next general election.|$|E

5|$|Elections {{were held}} in early October from which all {{political}} parties were barred from participating.

Castillo Armas became affiliated with a party named the Movimiento de Liberación Nacional (MLN), which remained <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>party</b> of Guatemala from 1954 to 1957. It was led by Mario Sandoval Alarcón, and was a coalition of municipal politicians, bureaucrats, coffee planters, {{and members of the}} military, all of whom were opposed to the reforms of the Guatemalan Revolution. In the congressional elections held under Castillo Armas, it was the only party allowed to run.|$|E

In 1971, the Croatian national movement, which sought greater civil rights and the decentralisation of the Yugoslav economy, culminated in the Croatian Spring, which was suppressed by the Yugoslav leadership. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines; the Croatian faction demanded a looser federation.|$|E

They established their own newspapers: Hairenik and Asbarez by Dashnaks and Baikar by Ramgavars. After the Bolsheviks took over Armenia in 1920, Rmagavars and Hunchaks formed a coalition supporting Soviet Armenia, while the ARF, <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>party</b> of the Republic of Armenia from 1918 to 1920, remained anti-Soviet in the diaspora. The 1988 Spitak earthquake and the Karabakh movement brought the separate groups of the Armenian community together.|$|E
5|$|Upholding {{the concept}} of {{representative}} democracy requires the protection of freedom of expression.

Free discourse about political ideas and government plans can facilitate the acknowledgement of current weaknesses or limitations.

5|$|The nomenklatura {{political}} elite developed. It comprised leaders, administrators and managers within <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>party</b> structure, in all branches {{of central and}} local government and in institutions of all kinds. The nomenklatura members were appointed by the party and exercised political control in all spheres of public life, for example economic development, industry management or education. For the party, the privileged nomenklatura layer was maintained to assure the proper placement {{of people who were}} ideologically reliable and otherwise qualified, but the revisionist dissidents Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski later described this system as a class dictatorship of central political bureaucracy for its own sake. The Polish public widely approved the many social undertakings of the communist government, including family apartment construction, child care, worker vacation and resorts, health care and full employment policies, but the special privileges granted nomenklatura and the security services were resented.|$|E

The JNA imposed a blockade of the Plitvice Lakes police station on 1 July, on the pretext that the Croatian police had abducted and imprisoned two JNA officers. By 6 July, the SAO Krajina forces and the JNA commenced attacks on the Ljubovo Pass southeast of the Plitvice Lakes, on the Titova Korenica–Gospić road, driving the Croatian National Guard back and capturing the pass {{by the end of}} the month. Throughout the summer, the JNA continued to engage Croatian forces in Lika using the units deployed to the Plitvice Lakes in April. The fighting escalated further on 30 August, when the JNA captured the Plitvice Lakes police station and the following day when the Battle of Gospić began.|$|E
5|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Transcaucasian Federation, the Armenians were left to fend for themselves as the Turkish army approached the capital of Yerevan. At first, fearing a major military defeat and massacre of the population of Armenia, the Dashnaks wanted to evacuate the city of Yerevan. Instead, the Military Council headed by Colonel Pirumian decided that they would not surrender and would confront the Turkish army. The opposing armies met on May 28, 1918, near Sardarapat. The battle was a major military success for the Armenian army as it was able to halt the invading Turkish forces. The Armenians also stood their ground at the Battle of Kara Killisse and at the Battle of Bash Abaran. The creation of the First Republic of Armenia was proclaimed on the same day of the Battle of Sardarapat, and the ARF became <b>the</b> <b>ruling</b> <b>party.</b> However, the new state was devastated, with a dislocated economy, hundreds of thousands of refugees, and a mostly starving population.|$|E
