40|$|Background: With {{the aim of}} {{developing}} methods that could increase the fracture resistance of structurally compromised endodontically treated teeth, {{this study was conducted}} to compare the effect of three esthetic post systems on the fracture resistance and failure modes of structurally compromised and normal roots. Materials and Methods: Forty five extracted and endodontically treated maxillary central teeth were assigned to 5 experimental groups (n= 9). In two groups, the post spaces were prepared with the corresponding drills of the post systems to be restored with double <b>taper</b> <b>light</b> posts (DT. Light-Post) (group DT. N) and zirconia posts (Cosmopost) (group Zr. N). In other 3 groups thin wall canals were simulated to be restored with Double <b>taper</b> <b>Light</b> posts (DT. W), double <b>taper</b> <b>Light</b> posts and Ribbond fibers (DT+R. W) and Zirconia posts (Zr. W). After access cavity restoration and thermocycling, compressive load was applied and the fracture strength values and failure modes were evaluated. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA, Tukey and Fisher exact tests (P< 0. 05). Results: The mean failure loads (N) were 678. 56, 638. 22, 732. 44, 603. 44 and 573. 67 for groups DT. N, Zr. N, DT. W, DT+R. W and Zr. w respectively. Group DT+R. W exhibited significantly higher resistance to fracture compared to groups Zr. N, DT. W and Zr. w (P< 0. 05). A significant difference was detected between groups DT. N and Zr. W (P= 0. 027). Zirconia posts showed significantly higher root fracture compared to fiber posts (P= 0. 004). Conclusion: The structurally compromised teeth restored with double <b>taper</b> <b>light</b> posts and Ribbond fibers showed the most fracture resistance and their strengths were comparable to those of normal roots restored with double <b>taper</b> <b>light</b> posts. More desirable fracture patterns were observed in teeth restored with fiber posts...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere {{are many}} severe and fatal crashes {{that result from}} {{vehicles}} colliding with street <b>columns</b> such as <b>lighting</b> <b>columns.</b> These cause extremely high impact forces and deformation on the frontal area of the car. The objective {{of the study is}} to demonstrate the frontal crash simulation of vehicle against <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> to examine injury risk and potential of safety. In particular, various FE models are used to perform contact–impact nonlinear dynamic analysis of <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> with vehicle. In this paper Abaqus explicit code is used to numerically simulate the crash of the vehicle with present <b>columns</b> and other <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> fabricated from a new suggested material. The acceleration, contact force and deformed energy at the frontal region of the vehicle are traced. It is found that the <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> with new suggested material have impact properties to decelerate the vehicle and absorb higher energy during impact...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} performance of consumer products {{is a major}} concern for many companies. In this work, an attributional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study was performed to identify the Best Practicable Environmental Option of three <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> made in alternative materials. These are a glass fibre reinforced polymer composite, and two traditional materials, steel and aluminium. Analysis of an alternative composite <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> with the same matrix, but reinforced with natural fibres (jute) was also performed. The results showed that the <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> made of steel has the worst overall environmental profile, although steel production is less energy intensive. The composite <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> is environmentally preferable due to its extended lifespan and lack of maintenance. The production of the raw material is responsible for most of the impacts in all three cases. The glass fibre production is the main contributor for the overall environmental burden of the composite column. In this case, the results also show that there are environmental advantages in replacing glass fibre for jute fibre. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologi...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) studies allow understanding {{all relevant}} processes and environmental impacts {{involved in the}} life cycle of products. However, in order to fully assess their sustainability, these studies should be complemented by economic (LCC) and societal analyses. In this context, the present work aims at assessing all costs (internal and external) and the environmental performance associated to the full life cycle of specific engineering products. These products are <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> for roadway illumination made with three different materials: a glass fibre reinforced polymer composite, steel and aluminium. Methods The LCA/LCC integrated methodology used was based in a “cradle-to-grave” assessment which considers the raw materials production, manufacture, on-site installation, use and maintenance, dismantlement and end-of-life (EoL) of the <b>lighting</b> <b>columns.</b> The fossil fuels environmental impact category was selected as the key environmental impact indicator to perform the integrated environmental and cost analysis. Results The potential total costs obtained for the full life cycle of the <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> demonstrated that the one made in steel performs globally worse than those made in composite or aluminium. Although the three systems present very similar internal costs, the steel column has higher external costs in the use phase that contribute for its higher total cost. This column has very high costs associated to safety features, since it constitutes a significant risk to the life of individuals. The raw material and column production stages are the main contributors for the total internal life cycle costs. The EoL treatment is a revenue source in all systems because it generates energy (in the case of the composite incineration) or materials (in the case of metal recycling). The composite and aluminium <b>lighting</b> <b>columns</b> present similar “cradle-to-grave” life cycle total cost. However, until the dismantlement phase, the aluminium column presents the highest environmental impact, whereas in the EoL treatment phase this scenario is reversed. The “cradle-to-grave” life cycle potential total cost and the environmental impact (fossil fuels) indicator of the steel <b>lighting</b> <b>column</b> are higher than those of the other columns. Conclusions Even though the uncertainties in the LCC are larger if external costs are included, their consideration when modelling the economic performance of engineering products increases the probability of developing a more sustainable solution from a societal perspective.
