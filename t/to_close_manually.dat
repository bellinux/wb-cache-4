40|$|Abstract. Temporal {{question}} classification assigns time granularities to temporal questions ac-cording {{to their}} anticipated answers. It {{is very important}} for answer extraction and verification in the literature of temporal question answering. Other than simply distinguishing between "date " and "period", a more finegrained classification hierarchy scaling down from "millions of years " to "second" is proposed in this paper. Based on it, a SNoW-based classifier, combining user preference, word N-grams, granularity of time expressions, special patterns as well as event types, is built to choose appropriate time granularities for the ambiguous temporal questions, such as When- and How long-like questions. Evaluation on 194 such questions achieves 83. 5 % accuracy, almost <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>manually</b> tagging accuracy 86. 2 %.

While a Web user agent resolves the CSS rules and computes their effect, our approach handles the way back. We argue, that this can remarkably improve CSS productivity, since the process of CSS authoring always involves this direction implicitly. Our approach claims a new and innovative way to reuse chunks of markup together with its presentation. It furthermore bears potential for the optimization and reorganization of CSS documents. We describe criteria for CSS code quality we oriented on, including a quantitative indicator for the abstractness of a CSS presentation specification. An evaluation and recomputation of the CSS for 25. 000 HTML documents shows that concerning these criteria the automatically generated code comes <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>manually</b> authored code...|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of face alignment affects {{the performance of}} a face recognition system. Since face alignment is usually conducted using eye positions, an accurate eye localization algorithm is therefore essential for accurate face recognition. In this paper, we first study the impact of eye locations on face recognition accuracy, and then introduce an automatic technique for eye detection. The performance of our automatic eye detection technique is subsequently validated using FRGC 1. 0 database. The validation shows that our eye detector has an overall 94. 5 % eye detection rate, with the detected eyes very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>manually</b> provided eye positions. In addition, the face recognition performance based on the automatic eye detection is shown to be comparable to that of using manually given eye positions. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Hardware {{transactional}} memory (HTM) is {{a promising}} technology {{to improve the}} productivity of parallel programming. However, a general agreement has not been reached on the consumability of HTM. User experiences indicate that HTM interface is not straightforward to be adopted by programmers to parallelize existing commercial applications, because of the internal limitation of HTM and the difficulties to identify shared variables hidden in the code. In this paper we demonstrate that, with well-designed encapsulation, HTM can deliver good consumability. Based {{on the study of}} a typical commercial application in supply chain simulations- GBSE, we develop a general scheduling engine that encapsulates the HTM interface. With the engine, we can convert the sequential program to multi-threaded model without changing any source code for the simulation logic. The time spent on parallelization is reduced from two months to one week, and the performance is <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>manually</b> tuned counterpart with fine-grained locks...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to present a method of {{three-dimensional}} computed tomographic (3 D-CT) cephalometrics and its use to study cranio/maxilla-facial malformations. We propose a system for automatic localization of cephalometric landmarks using reeb graphs. Volumetric images of a patient were reconstructed into 3 D mesh. The proposed method is carried out in three steps: we begin by applying 3 d mesh skull simplification, this mesh was reconstructed from a head volumetric medical image, and then we extract a reeb graph. Reeb graph mesh extraction represents a skeleton composed in a number of nodes and arcs. We are interested in the node position; we noted that some reeb nodes could be considered as cephalometric landmarks under specific conditions. The third step is to identify these nodes automatically by using elastic mesh registration using “thin plate ” transformation and clustering. Preliminary results show a landmarks recognition rate of more than 90 %, very <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>manually</b> provided landmarks positions made by a medical stuff...|$|R

40|$|To {{decouple}} {{test code}} from web page details, web testers adopt the Page Object design pattern. Page objects are facade classes abstracting the internals of web pages (e. g., form fields) into high-level business functions {{that can be}} invoked by test cases (e. g., user authentication). However, writing such page objects requires substantial effort, which is paid off only later, during software evolution. In this {{paper we propose a}} clustering-based approach for the identification of meaningful abstractions that are automatically turned into Java page objects. Our clustering approach to page object identification has been integrated into our tool for automated page object generation, APOGEN. Experimental results indicate that the clustering approach provides clusters of web pages <b>close</b> <b>to</b> those <b>manually</b> produced by a human (with, on average, only three differences per web application). 75 % of the code generated by APOGEN can be used as-is by web testers, breaking down the manual effort for page object creation.

40|$|We {{introduce}} an object-based {{method to}} automatically classify topography from SRTM data. The new method {{relies on the}} concept of decomposing land-surface complexity into more homogeneous domains. An elevation layer is automatically segmented and classified at three scale levels that represent domains of complexity by using self-adaptive, data-driven techniques. For each domain, scales in the data are detected with the help of local variance and segmentation is performed at these appropriate scales. Objects resulting from segmentation are partitioned into sub-domains based on thresholds given by the mean values of elevation and standard deviation of elevation respectively. Results resemble reasonably patterns of existing global and regional classifications, displaying a level of detail <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>manually</b> drawn maps. Statistical evaluation indicates that most of classes satisfy the regionalization requirements of maximizing internal homogeneity while minimizing external homogeneity. Most objects have boundaries matching natural discontinuities at regional level. The method is simple and fully automated. The input data consist of only one layer, which does not need any pre-processing. Both segmentation and classification rely on only two parameters: elevation and standard deviation of elevation. The methodology is implemented as a customized process for the eCognition® software, available as online download. The results are embedded in a web application with functionalities of visualization and download...|$|R

The study is based on 2610 ionograms recorded during the period June–December 2013. The automatic scaling was made by means of the Autoscala software. A few typical examples are shown to outline the method, and statistics are presented regarding the differences between manually and automatically scaled values of F 2, F 1, E and sporadic E (Es) layer parameters. We draw the conclusions that: 1. The F 2 parameters scaled by Autoscala, foF 2 and M(3000) F 2, are reliable. 2. F 1 is identified by Autoscala in significantly fewer cases (about 50 %) than in the manual routine, but if identified the values of foF 1 are reliable. 3. Autoscala frequently (30 % of the cases) detects an E layer when the manual scaling process does not. When identified by both methods, the Autoscala E-layer parameters are <b>close</b> <b>to</b> those <b>manually</b> scaled, foE agreeing to within 0. 4 MHz. 4.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{of this work}} is the design, implementation and evaluation of a new aspect-oriented intermediate language model that we call Nu. The primary motivation behind {{the design of the}} Nu model is to maintain the aspect-oriented design modularity in the intermediate code for the responsiveness of incremental compilers and source-level debuggers. Nu extends the object-oriented intermediate language model with two primitives: bind and remove. We demonstrate that these primitives are capable of expressing statically deployed constructs such as AspectJ 2 ̆ 7 s aspect, dynamic deployment construct such as CaeserJ 2 ̆ 7 s deploy as well as dynamic control flow constructs such as AspectJ 2 ̆ 7 s cflow by presenting compilation techniques from high-level languages to Nu for these constructs. Moreover, these compilation techniques also serve to show that aspect-oriented design modularity is indeed preserved in the Nu intermediate code. We also present the design and implementation of a prototype extension of the Sun Hotspot virtual machine that supports the Nu model, which serves to show that it is feasible to implement Nu in a production level virtual machine. A key concern for dynamic language models is the performance overhead of their implementation. Our performance analysis results show that method dispatch time is not degraded in our prototype implementation. Also, advice dispatch time remains fairly <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the <b>manually</b> inlined version...|$|R
40|$|Background: The short reads {{output by}} first- and second-generation DNA {{sequencing}} instruments cannot completely reconstruct microbial chromosomes. Therefore, most genomes {{have been left}} unfinished due to the significant resources required <b>to</b> <b>manually</b> <b>close</b> gaps in draft assemblies. Third-generation, single-molecule sequencing addresses this problem by greatly increasing sequencing read length, which simplifies the assembly problem. Results: To measure the benefit of single-molecule sequencing on microbial genome assembly, we sequenced and assembled the genomes of six bacteria and analyzed the repeat complexity of 2, 267 complete bacteria and archaea. Our {{results indicate that the}} majority of known bacterial and archaeal genomes can be assembled without gaps, at finished-grade quality, using a single PacBio RS sequencing library. These single-library assemblies are also more accurate than typical short-read assemblies and hybrid assemblies of short and long reads. Conclusions: Automated assembly of long, single-molecule sequencing data reduces the cost of microbial finishing to $ 1, 000 for most genomes, and future advances in this technology are expected to drive the cost lower. This is expected {{to increase the number of}} completed genomes, improve the quality of microbial genome databases, and enable high-fidelity, population-scale studies of pan-genomes and chromosomal organization.
