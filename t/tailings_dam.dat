25|$|A <b>tailings</b> <b>dam</b> is {{typically}} an earth-fill embankment dam used to store tailings, which are produced during mining operations after separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore. Conventional water retention dams can serve this purpose, {{but due to}} cost, a <b>tailings</b> <b>dam</b> is more viable. Unlike water retention dams, a <b>tailings</b> <b>dam</b> is raised in succession throughout {{the life of the}} particular mine. Typically, a base or starter dam is constructed, and as it fills with a mixture of tailings and water, it is raised. Material used to raise the dam can include the tailings (depending on their size) along with dirt.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a threat due to the <b>tailings</b> <b>dam.</b> An {{engineering}} report in March, 1988, gave information that the <b>tailings</b> <b>dam</b> overshadowing the town of Magna had threat of collapse due to an earthquake and that the billion-ton tailings pond would bury the homes nearby if the tailing pond’s embankment failed. The mine responded by proposing various potential strategies including buying up entire subdivisions near the tailings pond, calculating the company’s liability if the embankment failed, investing $500 million to reinforce the embankment, and colluding with state regulators to keep the engineering report {{out of the public}} eye.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} raised <b>tailings</b> <b>dam</b> designs, the upstream, {{downstream}} and centerline, named {{according to the}} movement of the crest during raising. The specific design used is dependent upon topography, geology, climate, the type of tailings, and cost. An upstream <b>tailings</b> <b>dam</b> consists of trapezoidal embankments being constructed on top but toe to crest of another, moving the crest further upstream. This creates a relatively flat downstream side and a jagged upstream side which is supported by tailings slurry in the impoundment. The downstream design refers to the successive raising of the embankment that positions the fill and crest further downstream. A centerlined dam has sequential embankment dams constructed directly on top of another while fill is placed on the downstream side for support and slurry supports the upstream side.|$|E

40|$|Static {{liquefaction}} {{has been}} considered {{as one of the}} most common failure mechanisms for <b>tailings</b> <b>dams.</b> However, for <b>tailings</b> with relatively high permeability, the assumption of an undrained condition becomes questionable under static loading conditions. In fact, many granular soil or tailings at its in-situ density may not liquefy under static, undrained conditions. In this paper, the problems with the current design approaches for <b>tailings</b> <b>dams</b> are identified. Laboratory test results are presented to demonstrate that granular soil can become unstable under drained or nonundrained conditions. Based on the testing data, two possible new failure mechanisms for <b>tailings</b> <b>dams</b> are proposed. Full Tex...|$|R

Acid digestion was employed in sample digestion followed by analysis using CVAAS. <b>Tailings</b> <b>dams,</b> community and garden soil, and stream sediments were further investigated for mercury fractions using a five step sequential extraction procedure. The concentrations of THg in <b>tailings</b> <b>dams,</b> community and gardens soil were 0. 890 – 6. 755  μg/g, 0. 431 – 0. 968  μg/g and 0. 471 – 1. 019  μg/g, respectively and the concentrations of THg in the sediments obtained from <b>tailings</b> <b>dams,</b> streams and wetlands were 0. 649 – 1. 998  μg/g, 0. 604 – 1. 356  μg/g and 0. 681 – 1. 356  μg/g, respectively. The concentrations of THg, in aqueous samples obtained from tailings, streams and wetlands were 0. 032 – 0. 070  μg/l, 0. 004 – 0. 068  μg/l and 0. 007 – 0. 012  μg/l, respectively. The sequential extraction procedure showed that most Hg in the <b>tailings</b> <b>dams</b> was largely elemental Hg and Hg bound to sulphur. Soil and sediments were largely dominated by organic bound Hg. Moderate seasonal correlation was observed in <b>tailings</b> <b>dams</b> soil, but weak seasonal correlation in soils collected in the vicinity of tailings. However, a strong seasonal correlation was observed in sediments and water samples. The concentrations of Hg obtained largely existed in organic and sulphate bound Hg and there is elevated potential to methylate Hg...|$|R
25|$|Mining, which {{provided}} more than 60% of Peru's export earnings in 2006, {{is a major}} water user and polluter. It is estimated that mining uses about 5% of Peru's water. In addition, it severely affects water quality. It {{has been estimated that}} more than half of Peru's peasant communities have been affected by mining activities, leading to the creation of organizations such as the National Committee of Mine Affected Communities (CONACAMI). The government had to declare an environmental state of emergency at several mining sites due to environmental disasters. For example, in July 2008 it declared a state of emergency at a mine near Lima over fears that arsenic, lead and cadmium from its <b>tailings</b> <b>dam</b> could pollute the main water supply for the capital. In July 2010 the government declared another state of environmental emergency in the central mining district of Huancavelica after a wastewater storage dam of the Caudalosa Chica company collapsed and leaked water laden with heavy metals into local rivers. The city La Oroya on the Mantaro River in Central Peru where the company Doe Run operates a big mining complex has been ranked as one of the 10 most contaminated cities in the world in 2007. Furthermore, an estimated 100,000 small-scale informal miners pollute rivers with cyanide and mercury.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Conventional {{upstream}} <b>tailings</b> <b>dams</b> {{are unique}} structures in that their shear strength and pore pressure conditions are {{often difficult to}} characterize, particularly during the design stage. Selection of shear strength models based on understanding contractant versus dilatant, and drained versus undrained, behaviour in shear {{was the subject of}} a companion paper. This paper addresses the complexity of proper characterization of pore pressure conditions in upstream <b>tailings</b> <b>dams,</b> and how this characterization is critical to selection of shear strength parameters and stability analysis methods. This paper reviews various pore pressure regimes that commonly exist within upstream <b>tailings</b> <b>dams,</b> and the significance of such conditions in terms the effective stress analysis (ESA) versus undrained strength analysis (USA) approaches. General recommendations are provided for the piezometric monitoring systems and geotechnical investigation techniques needed to properly characterize pore pressure conditions. 1 SIGNIFICANCE OF PORE PRESSURE CONDITIONS <b>Tailings</b> <b>dams</b> constructed using the conventional upstream method (i. e. with no compaction of the spigotted tailings beaches that form the dam shell) are, in contrast to the simplicity of the construction method, highly complex structures requiring a high degree of ongoing monitoring an...|$|R

40|$|Student Number : 9612464 Y - MSc {{dissertation}} - School of Mining Engineering - Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmentThis {{study was}} conducted at the West Rand Region, part of South African-based AngloGold operations. The study assesses the impacts of gold mining on the water quality and the change in landuse resulting from the mining activities on the West Rand Region. This was achieved by collecting historical data relating to the <b>tailings</b> <b>dams</b> and both surface and groundwater qualities between 1998 and 2003. The landuse information was gathered from the topographic map of Carltonville and remotely sensed data {{in the form of}} aerial photographs, landsat data and ASTER images. The data was analysed in a GIS ILWIS. The sizes of the <b>tailings</b> <b>dams</b> have not changed significantly during the study period. The size of the plantation also shows a decreasing trend due to pollution from the <b>tailings</b> <b>dams.</b> The area surrounding the Anglo Gold mining operations is sparsely-vegetated due to both poor soils and the impacts of mining activities. The surface water quality is poor and this water has negative impacts on the environment following accidental discharges and has potential negative impacts from seepage through the unlined dams. The quality of the groundwater is generally good with the exceptions of BH 18, MBH 8, MBH 5 and MBH 3 whose pollution arises from North mine <b>tailings</b> <b>dams</b> and North boundary dam. MBH 5 shows an improvement in water quality over time. The potential generation of AMD from the <b>tailings</b> <b>dams</b> is inhibited by the neutral pH of the tailings. In order to improve the environment in the West Rand Region and to prevent further pollution, planting of indigenous trees to make up for shrinking plantation and lining of the dams be undertaken. Stricter maintenance and monitoring of both the sewage plants and the dams be implemented to avoid accidental discharges of poor quality water into the environment. A study to accurately quantify the groundwater pollution arising from both the <b>tailings</b> <b>dams</b> and other surface water bodies should be undertaken...|$|R
