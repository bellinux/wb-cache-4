Lisa tells him that capturing and enjoying the best moments in life can make it fun, and Bart realizes she is right after Homer pushes him down the ice slide, with the whole family joining in. The final scene is a flash-forward to an elderly Bart in a retirement home, commenting on how much fun his life has been.|$|E

The season continued with Shakespeare's Hamlet and the musical Fela!. The second collaborative broadcast was King Lear with Derek Jacobi, live from Covent Garden's Donmar Warehouse. NT Live then broadcast two separate performances of a production: throughout {{the run of}} Frankenstein, Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller alternated the roles of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature, and audiences in cinemas had <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> both combinations.

25|$|As {{technology}} improved, so {{also did}} {{the kinds of}} innovative performances Tibbits {{was able to put}} on stage. Such obscure technologies as cinematoscopes and luminere cinematographs offered the promise of displaying moving pictures. Kleine's Lumiere Cinematograph promised families <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their sons in the Spanish–American War march toward the camera. Thomas Edison's Magniscope never reached Coldwater because it exploded en route, but his Animotoscope did. Eventually the Lyman H. Howe Company offered genuine moving pictures with its Vivograph Graphophone, which depicted a train ride through the Rocy Mountain's Frazer River Canyon. While such technologies had much to be desired in terms of quality, they were nonetheless important steps in the march toward the modern cinema.|$|E
25|$|The British Rallycross Grand Prix {{has come}} and gone in recent years, but none of the modern incarnations have come close to the 'real' Grand Prix, the {{versions}} of the event run at Brands Hatch between 1982 and 1994. The Rallycross Grand Prix was, in essence, an open-house, end of season, free for all. If you had a Rallycross car and fancied racing in the Grand Prix, you could make your entry and have a go. This led to some wonderful events and <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> unusual cars and star drivers; Denis Marcel's beautiful Matra Murena, unlikely and surprisingly fast NSUs from Norway, Stig Blomqvist wheeling out his privately owned Audi Quattro, sportscar ace Cor Euser doing a great job in a MG Metro 6R4, etc. The Grand Prix was different; it stood out from the crowd and appealed to competitors because it wasn’t just another event. Being Brands Hatch helped, geographically it was good and the circuit put all of its marketing and PR effort into making something of the event.|$|E

Peters won her second Tony for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her performance as Annie Oakley in the 1999 Broadway revival of Annie Get Your Gun. Among many glowing notices, critic Lloyd Rose of the Washington Post commented: [...] " [...] banishes all thoughts of Ethel Merman about two bars into her first number, 'Doin' What Comes Natur'lly.' Partly this is because Merman's Annie was a hearty, boisterous gal, while Peters plays an adorable, slightly goofy gamine. ... For anyone {{who cares about the}} American musical theater, <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Peters in this role is reason enough to see the show."

500|$|For Victor, Entity FX {{tried to}} create digital imagery of the character's inner {{workings}} to give the audience <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how his robotic side operates. For instance, Entity FX visually walked the audience {{through the process of}} how Victor's CPU downloads the schematics and diagrams to Lex's Level 33.1 facility, as well as disarming the security. Creating abilities for Arthur posed their own challenges, as there were not a lot of opportunities to put the character in the water {{when he was in the}} Mid-West. Using the technology they had when Arthur first came to Smallville, as well as the effects used in the unaired pilot for Aquaman, Entity FX was able to digitally create both Arthur and the water he swims in for the character's arrival shot at Level 33.1. When creating Arthur's super swimming speed, the team attempted to give the imagery a look similar to that of a torpedo gliding through the water. The team battled back and forth on how to illustrate Arthur's movements, deciding between having the character leave a trail of bubbles like a torpedo, or [...] "maneuvering around the water and...actually traveling with the bubbles".|$|E

Damore lamented the fact that the second season's cliffhanger ending had been left unresolved, and that viewers would never get <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Carter's [...] "happy ending", despite knowing she gets one, leaving the character's [...] "fate unfulfilled, languishing in the obscurity of 'what could have beens'". She also noted that Marvel had now lost [...] "the opportunity to show several prominent MCU events, {{not the least of which}} is the founding of S.H.I.E.L.D.", and added that despite making [...] "leaps and bounds for women in the MCU, the same [...] be said for people of color," [...] wishing the series had addressed Asian American women like Hazel Ying Lee, one of 38 Women Airforce Service Pilots who died in the line of duty, or Black women like Harriet Ida Pikens and Frances Wills, the first two Black members of the United States Naval Reserve.|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were critical. Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examinations, wrote a rather {{positive}} review of the episode. He noted that, while the episode [...] "told us nothing of significance" [...] regarding the [...] "big picture" [...] mythology story arc, <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Mulder and Scully together one last time resulted in [...] "an exquisite Mulder-Scully moment". He was particularly pleased with the final scene, noting {{that it was an}} appropriate conclusion; he called it [...] "fitting", as well as [...] "wonderful". Kessenich maintained that, {{were it not for the}} return of Duchovny, [...] "nobody would have given a damn about the end of this series." [...] Julie Salamon of The New York Times gave the episode a positive review. Salamon noted that [...] "Until the end, the series maintained its mesmerizing visual gloominess, cleverly punctuated with suggestive plays of color and light". She claimed the show [...] "also retained its conspiracy-theory heart that has appealed so greatly to viewers". John C. Snider of SciFiDimensions praised the episode, stating [...] "The Truth is a satisfying conclusion to the series, with plenty of twists and turns, a few surprise guest appearances, and an explosive finale complete with requisite black helicopters. The romantics among us will also be pleased with the culmination of the Mulder/Scully relationship".|$|E
500|$|Left Behind {{was written}} {{to focus on}} the {{relationship}} between Ellie and Riley, and to recount the events that defined their later personalities. Riley was chronologically introduced to Ellie in , a comic book written by creative director Neil Druckmann and artist Faith Erin Hicks. The team used the comic as a reference point when developing the relationship between Ellie and Riley, becoming particularly interested in having <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more of their relationship; Druckmann felt that they would not have developed Left Behind if American Dreams hadn't been written. Druckmann felt that the story of Joel and Ellie's relationship in The Last of Us dealt with survival, loyalty and love, and that Ellie and Riley's relationship in Left Behind deals with similar themes. Straley felt that the themes involve love, loss and devotion, pondering the extent that one goes to protect those one cares about. Ashley Johnson portrayed Ellie in Left Behind, reprising her role from The Last of Us. To portray Riley, the team cast Yaani King; Johnson has noted that it was interesting to act against someone different, and that King fit the role immediately. King felt intimidated to become part of a large project, and was worried about [...] "fit in". The team found it interesting {{to tell the story of}} Riley, as players of The Last of Us were already aware of the effect that she had on Ellie; Left Behind sees Riley's behavior change Ellie, resulting in the latter's focus to fight in order to save those close to her. The team were also interested in Ellie's behavior around Riley; she is perceived as being more playful. In Left Behind, Ellie and Riley share a kiss; the team explored omitting the kiss from the game, but felt that it was imperative to the story, and that it strengthened the relationship. Though initially he only felt that Ellie viewed Riley as an influence, Druckmann later considered her romantic appeal, and decided to explore the concept.|$|E
