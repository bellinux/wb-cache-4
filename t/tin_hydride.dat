40|$|Eight {{members of}} a new family of highly {{fluorinated}} (fluorous) <b>tin</b> <b>hydrides</b> have been synthesized and studied as reagents for radical reactions. <b>Tin</b> <b>hydrides</b> of the general formulas [Rf(CH 2) (n) ] 3 SnH-and [Rf(CH 2) (n) ]Me 2 SnH have been prepared where Rf is C 4 F 9, C 6 F 13, C 8 F 17, or C 10 F 21 and n is 2 or 3. These reagents are highly soluble in fluorinated solvents, and partition coefficients between perfluorohexanes and several organic solvents have been measured. The reagents are generally useful for reductive radical reactions and hydrostannation reactions that would typically be conducted with tributyltin hydride. Stoichiometric and catalytic procedures have been developed, and both feature very easy separation of the tin products from the organic products by convenient liquid-liquid or solid-liquid extractions. The tin reagents are recovered from reactions in high yields and are routinely reused. Rate constant measurements suggest that the fluorous <b>tin</b> <b>hydrides</b> are about as reactive as (or in some cases, slightly more reactive than) tributyltin hydride. The reagents show excellent potential for large-scale application in 'green' (environmentally friendly) processes.

First, addition of a Grignard or organolithium reagent to a trialkyltin halide will yield the organostannane. Palladium can also promote a radical addition of <b>tin</b> <b>hydride</b> to alkynes or alkenes. The benefits of using organotin reagents are that they are air and moisture stable (some reactions can even take place in water), they can be synthesized, purified by chromatography, and store for long periods of time, and they are tolerant of most functional groups.

5000|$|Reductive desulfonylation {{reactions}} lead to {{the replacement}} of a carbon-sulfur bond in the sulfonyl group with a carbon-hydrogen bond. Because the sulfonyl group is by definition attached to two carbons, however, reduction to two sets of products is possible. Mechanistic studies of reductions employing metal amalgams as the reducing agent suggest that upon electron transfer to the sulfone, fragmentation to a sulfinate anion and the more stable organic radical occurs. Immediate reduction of the radical and protonation then occur to afford the sulfur-free product derived from the more stable radical. Thus, S-alkyl bonds are cleaved in preference to S-aryl or S-alkenyl bonds.Samarium(II) iodide {{may be used to}} reductively cleave α-keto sulfones; in the presence of hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), SmI2 is able to effect reductive elimination of α-functionalized sulfones (see equation (...) below).Tin hydrides reduce α-keto and allylic sulfones. The mechanisms of these processes involve the addition of a tin-centered radical to the substrate followed by elimination of a sulfinyl radical, which abstracts a hydrogen from a molecule of <b>tin</b> <b>hydride</b> to propagate the radical chain.

The mechanism of desulfonylation of α-keto sulfones is similar.Transition-metal-mediated reductive desulfonylations rely on the generation of an intermediate π-allyl complex, which undergoes nucleophilic attack by hydride or another nucleophile to afford reduced products. Nucleophilic attack generally occurs at the less substituted position of the π-allyl moiety, although site selectivity depends strongly on the substrate and reaction conditions. Palladium(0) complexes are the most commonly used precatalysts.|$|E

Proton spectra of di-cyclohexyl <b>tin</b> <b>hydride</b> and di-benzyl <b>tin</b> <b>hydride</b> have been reported for the first time. Some of the hydrides were deuterated [(CH 3) 2 SnH 2, (C 6 H 5) 2 SnH 2, C 6 H 5 H 3 and (C 6 H 5 CH 2 SnH 2] {{and the effects of}} deuterium substitution both on shielding and on spin spin coupling constants have been measured. Sn spectra at 22. 37 MHz were obtained by the pulse FT method and values for 119 Sn chemical shift and tin-proton and tin-deuterium coupling constants obtained. Isotopic effects were observed both on shifts and coupling constants as a result of deuterium substitution. A linear dependence for Sn shifts on the number of substituents in methyl and phenyl stannanes has been found. The spin-lattice relaxation times (T 1) of the naturally abundant magnetic tin satellites in the proton spectra of these hydrides have been measured and were found to be shorter than the relaxation times of the central feature resulting from molecules containing non-magnetic tin. Correlation times were calculated from the dipolar contribution to the total relaxation time. The temperature dependence of C spin-lattice relaxation time in di-methyl <b>tin</b> <b>hydride</b> has also been studied.
