5|$|Dragon Quest {{games have}} an overall upbeat feeling. The typical Dragon Quest plot {{involves}} the player controlling {{a party of}} heroes to defeat an ultimate evil villain, who usually threatens the world in some way. The plot-line often consists of smaller stories that involve encounters with other characters. This linear plot-line is intentional, <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>ease</b> the generally high learning curve RPGs have for those unaccustomed to them. The gameplay is designed to allow players to decide when, and whether, to pursue certain storyline paths. To ensure players continue to enjoy playing the game, no storyline path is made without some kind of reward and, <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>ease</b> players who may be apprehensive about whether {{they are on the}} right path, the distance the character has to travel to get rewarded is reduced {{at the beginning of the}} game. While the player never starts the game in a wholly non-linear way, they usually allow players to explore an open world in a non-linear manner following an early linear section of the game. Early character levels start players off with more hit points and a substantially increasing growth at later levels, although the effective bonuses of every additional level decreases.|$|E

At first, Scully believes that Crump is suffering from some sort of biological contagion, but after investigating the Crumps' home, she discovers a U.S. Navy antenna array emitting ELF waves stretches beneath their property. Scully deduces that an abnormal surge in these waves somehow caused a rising pressure in the inner ear of the nearby inhabitants. Westward motion and an increase in speed seems to be the only thing <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>ease</b> the pain of the increasing pressure.|$|E

5|$|Due to the fog, {{visibility}} {{was low and}} the {{two main}} forces failed to notice Oxford's victory over Hastings. As such, {{the collapse of the}} Yorkist left wing had little (if any) effect on morale of either side. The fighting between Montagu's and Edward's groups was evenly matched and intense. The Lancastrian left wing, however, was suffering treatment similar to that Oxford had inflicted on its counterpart; Gloucester exploited the misaligned forces and beat Exeter back. Progress for Edward's brother was slow because his group was fighting up a slight slope. Nonetheless, the pressure he exerted on the Lancastrian left wing rotated the entire battle line. Warwick, seeing the shift, ordered most of his reserves <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>ease</b> the pressure on Exeter, and took the rest into fighting at the centre. Gradually, the battle line settled to an orientation that slanted north-east to south-west.|$|E

Rays manager Joe Maddon stated that once the Rays finished interleague play, and returned to playing American League teams, he would consider putting Pena in the Designated Hitter role <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>ease</b> the workload on his {{left index finger}}, as the Rays were more concerned about his ability to throw the ball, more than having to swing the bat.|$|E

25|$|Because of the prisons' {{overcrowding}} {{crisis in}} Birmingham in October 2006 three dozen police cells {{are to be}} made available to house inmates in Birmingham <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>ease</b> congestion. (By contrast, one contemporary account reported, in 1833, that for days the city gaol had been entirely empty.) Despite a dip in the number of prisoners that month, prisons in the region are close to capacity or already full. Between 32 and 44 cells were set aside at Steelhouse Lane police station, in Birmingham City Centre, in case of emergency. West Midlands Police has an established agreement with HM Prison Service to provide cells in the event they are needed.|$|E

25|$|However, {{regardless}} of whether or not Dmitry's tale was authentic, the Wiśniowiecki brothers, along with Samuel Tyszkiewicz, Jan Sapieha, Roman Różyński, and several other Polish noblemen soon agreed to fully back the man, and his claim, against Tsar Boris Godunov. In March 1604, Dmitry visited the royal court of Sigismund III Vasa in Kraków. The king provisionally supported him, but gave no promise of military aid <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>ease</b> the young man's path to the throne. To attract the support of powerful Jesuits in lieu of the king outright stating anything, Dmitry publicly converted to Roman Catholicism on 17 April 1604, thus convincing papal nuncio Claudio Rangoni to also back up the young Russian's claim.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} a new sort {{of engineering}} support tool that directly addresses {{one of the}} major remaining sources of delay and error in engineering projects: the need to coordinate the actions of large and often distributed engineering teams. By combining now-standard web-based enterprise information technologies with ideas and techniques from artificial intelligence we have produced a tool that supports capture of design history and rationale, and then exploits the resulting dependency network to identify possible consequences of design changes and conflicts. The system can generate targeted notifications of affected designers, and supports on-line discussions aimed at resolving design difficulties. In addition <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> <b>ease</b> team coordination problems, this tool can also provide a solid base for proactive design knowledge management. A version of this system has been implemented, and the resulting Advanced Design Coordination Tool (ADCT) is available for evaluation and as a customizable product. Introduction: Proble...|$|R

25|$|France {{seemed to}} be at the start of civil unrest in 1899, and once again Louis Lépine was {{recalled}} <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>ease</b> the situation. Again and again Paris appeared to be on the point of violent protestations, but through wise diplomacy and carefully organised policing, Lépine managed to avoid the worst of times. He attempted to limit the role of the army as a force of internal order by handling most situations with police and gendarmerie alone. During these febrile times France faced the possibility of a military government and whilst there were occasions when Lépine required military assistance to control demonstrations it is credit to his reforms that these were rare and that the gendamerie largely controlled the civil strife.|$|E

In Northern California, two agencies have teamed up to develop the San Ramon Valley Recycled Water Program. Jointly sponsored by the Dublin San Ramon Services District and the East Bay Municipal Utility District, the program will provide recycled water to municipal parks, golf courses, business parks, greenbelts and roadways. The Irvine Ranch Water District has built a dual water system, which supplies recycled water to commercial high rises for use in flushing toilets and urinals. A West Basin Municipal Water District project distributes recycled water to more than 85 customers, including Chevron and Mobil refineries.
