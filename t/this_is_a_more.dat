5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Coastal Cushion' (= 'Schnapper Point') was {{originally}} collected by Neil Marriott and called 'Schnapper Point' {{from the same}} locality as 'Birthday Candles'. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> spreading plant to 50cm tall and up to 1.5–2m across with dark red-styled gold flowers (a couple of shades darker than 'Birthday Candles') 15cm high by 6cm across. It is propagated by Richard Anderson of Merricks Nursery. It {{appears to be more}} adaptable to points north than other dwarf forms – growing reliably in southeastern Queensland. This form can be very floriferous, with some plants sporting more than 40 inflorescences at any one time.|$|E

25|$|This {{is because}} the Dutch Ministry of Justice applies a gedoogbeleid (tolerance policy) {{with regard to the}} {{category}} of soft drugs: an official set of guidelines telling public prosecutors under which circumstances offenders should not be prosecuted. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> official version of a common practice in other European countries wherein law enforcement sets priorities regarding offenses on which it is important enough to spend limited resources.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} Buddhist texts, and as {{taught by the}} modern Theravada school, the goal of {{becoming}} a teaching Buddha in a future life is viewed as the aim {{of a small group}} of individuals striving to benefit future generations after the current Buddha's teachings have been lost, but in the current age there is no need for most practitioners to aspire to this goal. Theravada texts do, however, hold that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> perfectly virtuous goal.|$|E
25|$|When {{excessive}} {{inflammation of}} the colon renders primary bowel resection too risky, bowel resection with colostomy remains an option. Also known as the Hartmann's operation, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> complicated surgery typically reserved for life-threatening cases. The bowel resection with colostomy implies a temporary colostomy which {{is followed by a}} second operation to reverse the colostomy. The surgeon makes an opening in the abdominal wall (a colostomy) which helps clear the infection and inflammation. The colon is brought through the opening and all waste is collected in an external bag.|$|E
25|$|This {{refers to}} any disease {{that can be}} caught during sexual {{activity}} with another person, including vaginal or anal sex or (less commonly) through oral sex (see below). Transmission is either directly between surfaces in contact during intercourse (the usual route for bacterial infections and those infections causing sores) or from secretions (semen or the fluid secreted by the excited female) which carry infectious agents that get into the partner's blood stream through tiny tears in the penis, vagina or rectum (<b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> usual route for viruses). In this second case, anal sex is considerably more hazardous since the penis opens more tears in the rectum than the vagina, as the vagina is more elastic and more accommodating.|$|E

50|$|Earlier in August 2008, archeologists at the Huaca Pucllana ruins in Lima (located some 500 mi {{south of}} Chiclayo) {{discovered}} <b>a</b> mummy that <b>is</b> also thought to <b>be</b> Wari. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> typical location {{for such a}} find, within the territory known to be Wari.|$|R
25|$|African honeybees abscond (abandon {{the hive}} and any food store {{to start over}} in a new location) more readily than European honeybees. This is not {{necessarily}} a severe loss in tropical climates where plants bloom all year but in more temperate climates it can leave the colony with insufficient stores to survive the winter. Thus Africanized bees are expected to be a hazard mostly in the Southern States of the United States, reaching as far north as the Chesapeake Bay in the east. The cold-weather limits of the African bee have driven some professional bee breeders from Southern California into the harsher wintering locales of the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascade Range. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> difficult area to prepare bees for early pollination placement in, such as is required for the production of almonds. The reduced available winter forage in northern California means that bees must be fed for early spring buildup.|$|E
25|$|These models {{rely on the}} {{assumption}} that asset price fluctuations are the result of a well-behaved random or stochastic process. This is why mainstream models (such as the famous Black-Scholes model) use normal probabilistic distributions to describe price movements. For all practical purposes, extreme variations can be ignored. Mandelbrot thought this was an awful way to look at financial markets. For him, the distribution of price movements is not normal and has the property of kurtosis, where fat tails abound. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> faithful representation of financial markets: the movements of the Dow index for the past hundred years reveals a troubling frequency of violent movements. Still, conventional models used {{by the time of the}} 2008 financial crisis ruled out these extreme variations and considered they can only happen every 10,000 years. An obvious conclusion from Mandelbrot’s work is that greater regulation in financial markets is indispensable. Other contributions of his work for the study of stock market behaviour are the creation of new approaches to evaluate risk and avoid unanticipated financial collapses.|$|E
25|$|However, chromatographic {{methods for}} {{separation}} started being {{adopted in the}} early 1980s. Developments were ongoing in the time period between when Cohn fractionation started being used, in 1946, and when chromatography started being used, in 1983. In 1962, the Kistler & Nistchmann process was created which was a spin-off of the Cohn process. Chromatographic processes {{began to take shape}} in 1983. In the 1990s, the Zenalb and the CSL Albumex processes were created which incorporated chromatography with a few variations. The general approach to using chromatography for plasma fractionation for albumin is: recovery of supernatant I, delipidation, anion exchange chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, and gel filtration chromatography. The recovered purified material is formulated with combinations of sodium octanoate and sodium N-acetyl tryptophanate and then subjected to viral inactivation procedures, including pasteurisation at 60°C. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> efficient alternative than the Cohn process for four main reasons: 1) smooth automation and a relatively inexpensive plant was needed, 2) easier to sterilize equipment and maintain a good manufacturing environment, 3) chromatographic processes are less damaging to the albumin protein, and 4) a more successful albumin end result can be achieved. Compared with the Cohn process, the albumin purity went up from about 95% to 98% using chromatography, and the yield increased from about 65% to 85%. Small percentage increases make a difference in regard to sensitive measurements like purity. There is one big drawback in using chromatography, which {{has to do with the}} economics of the process. Although the method was efficient from the processing aspect, acquiring the necessary equipment is a big task. Large machinery is necessary, and for a long time the lack of equipment availability was not conducive to its widespread use. The components are more readily available now but it is still a work in progress.|$|E

50|$|Around 11,400 BCE, the Bromme culture {{emerged in}} Southern Scandinavia. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> rapidly warming era and this {{provided}} opportunity for other substantial hunting game animals than the ubiquitous reindeer.
