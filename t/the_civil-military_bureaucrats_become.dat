40|$|During {{the last}} year the {{security}} threats to the European Union have increased dramatically {{under the influence of}} military crisis in eastern Ukraine and Islamic terrorist activities in Europe. Consequently the demand for defence in the member states of the European Union has become greater than in previous years. This situation leads to the dilemma when the high level of defence expenditure can hamper the financial support of other sectors of national economy. Therefore it is necessary to increase the efficiency of available financial resources that have been allocated for the defence without a significant increase in defence expenditure. In order to achieve this efficiency the concept of closer cooperation between military and civil sector can be the base for complex defence support measures that use the potential of national economy. Having regard to the above mentioned, {{the purpose of this study}} is to introduce <b>the</b> concept of <b>civil-military</b> cooperation that utilizes the main task of military Keynesianism (to stimulate industrial development and economic growth) and functions within the framework of Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Union. In order to analyse the concept the following tasks were set: 1) to modify the standard concept of military Keynesianism by the analysis of different theoretical sources; 2) to identify the main advantages and deficiencies of <b>the</b> <b>civil-military</b> cooperation concept by the use of expert interview; 3) to set out the main conditions for the functioning of <b>the</b> <b>civil-military</b> cooperation concept by the use of cost-benefit analysis. The following primary qualitative and quantitative methods have been used in this research: 1) literature analysis that incorporates the study of theoretical works, research articles, as well as policy and legal documents; 2) expert interview that has been conducted after <b>the</b> presentation of <b>civil-military</b> cooperation concept to the experts from the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Latvia and Latvian National Armed Forces Joint Headquarters. 3) cost-benefit analysis of hypothetical implementation of <b>the</b> <b>civil-military</b> cooperation concept for ammunition manufacturing in the territory of the European Union. The research shows that the negative impact of the identified deficiencies of <b>the</b> <b>civil-military</b> cooperation concept can be significantly reduced by the use of effective legal framework and simple procedures of implementation. Also the main conclusion of the research is that under the pressure of the high demand for defence the member states of the European Union,which defence industrial base is small or non-existent (Poland, Baltic states et al.), can use <b>the</b> <b>civil-military</b> cooperation concept in order to attract the foreign manufacturers of military or dual-use goods by implementation of tax relief,as well as use of state infrastructure objects at a reduced price...|$|R

To achieve this goal, risk and uncertainty are defined in terms of knowledge (total or partial) of possible future events or potential outcomes of the action/ decision. The decision alternatives capitalize the results obtained by the optional (the real options analysis in conditions of uncertainty) and flexibility (the prediction of transition moment according to the life cycle of resources).

The early chapters are devoted to explaining the ideological and historical background of the American revolution with respect to American fears of power, anarchy, standing armies, and military despotism; the American 2 ̆ 7 s faith in their militia; and their insistence on civil supremacy being the guiding principle of <b>the</b> <b>civil-military</b> relationship. Also detailed is how the Continental Army was created, structured, and maintained so as to minimize the possibility of it subverting the civilian governments. Additionally addressed in the early chapters are the personal and political dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>civil-military</b> relationship. How <b>the</b> Continental Congress and state governments controlled and directed their military forces, as well as how the military controlled themselves, is detailed in the middle chapters. Also included in these chapters is an analysis of the military 2 ̆ 7 s often critical opinion of the civilian governments and the American people; explanations for those instances when the military threatened and violated the lives, liberties, and properties of their fellow citizens; and a discussion of the military 2 ̆ 7 s frequent involvement in and interference with the civilian governments and the political process. The last chapters are devoted to an analysis of <b>the</b> <b>civil-military</b> relationship during <b>the</b> last four years of the Revolutionary War, when it was most severely tested, and when the American Revolution was most susceptible to being undermined by a domestic military tyranny. Special attention is given in these chapters to the factors which prevented the Continental Army from subverting the civilian governments, particularly during the last year of the war.

40|$|DOI: [URL] The {{education}} {{in human rights}} is an important mediation for affirming and building democracy. In Brazil, the year of 2014 is the 50 th anniversary of <b>the</b> <b>civil-military</b> putsch which had started {{a long period of}} dictatorship that lasted more than two decades, with systematic practices of human rights violations by part of the State. Into this framework {{it is very important to}} develop a pedagogy of memory to educate for the “never more” in the sense of qualifying and improving the democracy. From the focus on (dis) celebrating the 50 th anniversary of <b>the</b> <b>civil-military</b> dictatorship, this article is structured into three parts. The first one presents the origin of the expression “never more”, its incorporation by the human rights education, and its relationship with the memory. It also deepens into the different senses of the memory and its contributions and articulations to the education for “never more”. Finally it argues why to educate for the “never more”. The second part presents three pedagogical proposals from the vision of the (dis) celebrating of the 50 years of <b>the</b> <b>civil-military</b> dictatorship for educating for the “never more”: one general character proposal, another guided to the teacher training, and the third one for the teacher to work with their students in class. Finally, some considerations are made about the subject of the work of memory/ies and the education for the “never more”...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes {{the effect of}} high levels of criminal violence on military missions and civil–military relations. Specifically, it examines how the criminal violence in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras changed the militaries and subsequently altered <b>the</b> <b>civil–military</b> relations in each country. In {{order to determine the}} change, each country is evaluated in terms of military missions immediately after transitioning to a civilian democracy and then again in present day. Similarly, each country is then evaluated for <b>the</b> state of <b>civil–military</b> relations at <b>the</b> end of military authoritarianism, and then again in present day. The results of the research show that the militaries have changed in three distinct ways: 1) the overall missions have shifted from traditional to internal, 2) the equipment used and procured is best suited for internal missions, and 3) the doctrine and training of the militaries supports an internal role. <b>The</b> <b>civil–military</b> relations research shows that there is an imbalance {{as a result of the}} criminal violence.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{literature}} on <b>civil-military</b> relations has always focused on democratic civilian {{control of the}} armed forces. There is currently a debate in <b>the</b> <b>civil-military</b> relations field concerning the amount of military knowledge politicians should possess in order to effectively control the armed forces.

This thesis attempts to illustrate the differences between political and knowledge-based management of the armed forces by examining two case studies: Chile and Colombia.
