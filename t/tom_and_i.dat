500|$|In 1974, Aerosmith brought [...] "Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] {{into the}} hard-rock mainstream. [...] Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Tom Hamilton had {{performed}} the song prior to joining Aerosmith. [...] Perry recalled, [...] "'Train Kept A-Rollin {{was the only}} song we had in common {{when we first got}} together. [...] Steven's band had played 'Train' and <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> played it in our band... It's a blues song, if you follow its roots all the way back... I always thought if I could just play one song, it would be that one because of what it does to me". [...] Perry's band began performing the song regularly after he had been moved by the performance of [...] "Stroll On" [...] in Blowup; Tyler recalled his band opened for the Yardbirds in 1966: ...|$|E
500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{referred}} to Blink-182 as the band's [...] "underrated masterwork," [...] writing that {{the record is}} generally considered by [...] "fans, critics and band members alike as its best work, Blink's answer to Pet Sounds or Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." [...] The band themselves have regarded it as a [...] "huge turning point" [...] in their career, marking {{a change in the}} way they write and record music, as well as view themselves. In his memoir Can I Say, Barker writes: [...] "It {{had a little bit of}} everything: we ventured far enough outside our genre to make ourselves happy, but not so far that we offended our fan base. It was a perfect happy medium, and it's the Blink album that Mark, <b>Tom,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are most proud of." ...|$|E

60|$|They went. Marie <b>and</b> <b>Tom,</b> <b>and</b> Mother <b>and</b> <b>I</b> played {{bridge in}} one corner. Lettie {{said she wanted}} to show George some new pictures, and they bent over a {{portfolio}} for some time. Then she bade him help her to clear the room for the dances.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sentence}} I {{spoke to}} the boys, Sam <b>and</b> <b>Tom</b> could mean either I {{spoke to the}} boys <b>and</b> Sam <b>and</b> <b>Tom</b> (<b>I</b> spoke to more than three people) or I spoke to the boys, who are Sam <b>and</b> <b>Tom</b> (<b>I</b> spoke to two people); ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then that is settled, <b>Tom.</b> <b>And</b> now, <b>I</b> suppose," [...] <b>and</b> {{her voice}} quivered a little, [...] "you {{will want to}} be off {{as soon as you}} can?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right you are, <b>Tom,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am {{not ashamed}} {{to admit it}} to you. But please don't--don't well, make fun of it to me any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I said I would, <b>Tom,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will. I'll ha'nt that tavern {{every night}} for a year! I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Several {{have gone}} out, but no traces {{are to be}} had. Dick, <b>Tom,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are in to hunt for him, though, as soon as our Uncle Randolph will permit it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Six {{months after}} our [...] "gam" [...] with the Yankees <b>Tom</b> Lokins <b>and</b> <b>I</b> found {{ourselves}} seated {{once more in}} the little garret beside my dear old mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Papa, I {{wish you}} 'd come and waltz with me. Fan {{told me not}} to go near her, 'cause my wed dwess makes her pink one look ugly; <b>and</b> <b>Tom</b> won't; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> want to dwedfully." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>And</b> tell <b>Tom,</b> Dick, <b>and</b> Harry <b>I</b> {{rose from}} the dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's fine {{of you to}} be able to do it, Dick. I am only sorry I can't help you. But {{some day}} <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will finish up here and then we'll take hold." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would stand}} the courts, {{and is just}} the truth," [...] cried Hurry; [...] "you've got it now, old <b>Tom,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> should like {{to hear what you}} mean to make out of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To see me here {{under the}} circumstances," [...] put in Leonard bitterly. [...] "Nor {{would you have}} done so, but <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{understood}} that it was only to be a three days' sale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And, Captain Bunting," [...] {{continued}} Ned, [...] "do you {{water the}} horses and mules: our vaquero will help you. Jones will unpack the provender. <b>Tom</b> Collins <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will see to getting supper ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{vote the}} girls all {{go into the}} cabin," [...] said Dick. [...] "Sam can go with them if he wants to. <b>Tom,</b> you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can stay on deck {{to look after the}} sails." ...|$|R
6000|$|You {{must get}} well <b>Tom,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> shall feel whole and genial as the winter air. Give me as many letters as you like, and write to Sawrey soon. I {{received}} a short letter from Bailey about Cripps, {{and one from}} Haydon, ditto. Haydon thinks he improved very much. Mrs. Wells desires particularly ... to <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> her respects to George, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> desire no better than to be ever your most affectionate Brother ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, Leonard, {{you could}} not; <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> both {{saw that in}} your looks, and quite {{expected}} to hear of your being ill; but, you see, we are never tried above what we can bear!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do so want not to {{make you}} angry, Uncle <b>Tom.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> do so wish he would be happy with someone else. Nobody ought {{to be made to}} marry unless they like it;--ought they?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sam, I guess <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{had better}} go on ahead," [...] said Dick. [...] "You can follow on foot, {{if you want}} to, and you can come, too, if you wish," [...] he added, to the colored man.|$|E
5000|$|I {{spoke to}} the boys, Sam, <b>and</b> <b>Tom</b> - must be the boys <b>and</b> Sam <b>and</b> <b>Tom</b> (<b>I</b> spoke to more than three people).|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} have come in <b>Tom's</b> place, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hope you will be good, and not get into scrapes, for I told papa I thought you would not; and you see, if you do, he will turn round and blame me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Looking for a {{title track}} for the as yet unnamed album, Mick Fleetwood {{suggested}} that they take the rehearsal riff that Lindsey Buckingham used for sound-checks. Producers Richard Dashut and Ken Caillat hence created a drum-driven production. In addition to normal drums, Fleetwood Mac also experimented with different found sounds on the song. Fleetwood and Buckingham played lamb chops and a Kleenex box on the track respectively. [...] I'm playing floor <b>toms,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> overdubbed a lot of American Indian wood tribal drums. It's a whole hodgepodge of Kleenex boxes, drums, weird stuff, slapping of lamb chops <b>and</b> things. <b>I</b> got a big leg of lamb in there somewhere - I'm hitting it with a spatula. Mick Fleetwood ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I {{am proud}} when the least unselfish nature has from first to last done the most unselfish things. No {{one of us}} has ever given up so much as <b>Tom,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am sure he will be happy in it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, that's where <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{were bound}} for when {{we fell in}} with Stalker and his band! We shall {{probably}} meet Tom returning. But the road is horrible--indeed there is no road at all, and I don't think a cart could--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All arranged," [...] {{answered}} Sam. [...] "We {{are going}} to take you up. Dick is going to take Dora in a buggy, and <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{are going to}} take you and Nellie in a two-seated. The baggage can go in a wagon behind." ...|$|E

5000|$|At {{the first}} {{practice}} before the 1959 season, Nugent addressed his team, [...] "Hi, I'm <b>Tom</b> Nugent <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hate West Virginia."

6000|$|... "Is {{it really}} Dick Rover?" [...] {{questioned}} the newcomer, as he shook hands. [...] "And <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> Sam, too! <b>I</b> must be dreaming. Is Putnam Hall on its travels?" ...|$|R
6000|$|They lost no time, {{but they}} did not eat in haste, and Alton glanced at Seaforth when the meal was done. [...] "You'll stop right here, Charley, by the tent," [...] he said. [...] "I can't quite tell when <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will be back again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be {{something}} for you to look forward to, <b>Tom,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> doubt not that you will find among the spare ones at Villeroy one as good as your own, and that with practice you will {{soon be able to}} shoot as truly with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{seen all}} along that we've been growing apart," [...] he added sadly. [...] "You've got certain ideas about things which I can't share. I suppose I'm old fashioned.

6000|$|... "I {{feel as if}} I {{had known}} them for years, instead of hours," [...] he told himself. [...] "There is a certain {{attractiveness}} about Sam, <b>Tom,</b> <b>and</b> Dick <b>I</b> cannot understand. Yet I do not wonder {{that they have a}} host of friends who are willing to do almost anything for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{expect it}} would have been for <b>Tom</b> <b>and</b> you. If <b>I</b> had remembered what my {{business}} on the wharf was I should never have brought all this upon you." ...|$|R
