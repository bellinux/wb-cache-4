5|$|After {{navigating}} {{the palace of}} Azad and reaching the hourglass of the Sands in the Tower of Dawn, <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> hesitates when following Farah's instructions on containing the Sands, unsure of whether to trust her. The Vizier ambushes them and they barely escape with the Dagger, ending up in a tomb beneath the city. Eventually finding shelter in a mysterious bathhouse, the two rest and consummate their growing feelings for each other. When <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> wakes up back in the palace, Farah has gone with the Dagger, leaving him her amulet. He follows her and only just manages to catch her as she is driven over a ledge above the hourglass by monsters. To save <b>the</b> <b>Prince,</b> Farah allows herself to fall to her death. As <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> mourns over her, the Vizier offers him eternal life {{in exchange for the}} Dagger. <b>The</b> <b>Prince</b> refuses and stabs the hourglass with the Dagger. Time rewinds to before the attack on the Maharaja's palace, and <b>the</b> <b>Prince,</b> still in possession of the Dagger and his memories, runs ahead to warn Farah of the Vizier's treachery. It is now revealed that <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> has been recounting his tale to Farah, and as he finishes, the Vizier enters to kill him. <b>The</b> <b>Prince</b> kills the Vizier and returns the Dagger to Farah, who believes his narrative was just a story. In parting, <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> mentions a private word she told him during their time in the tomb, leaving her amazed.|$|E

5|$|The {{story is}} set in Persia during the 9th century AD, and begins with <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> narrating to an unseen {{listener}} about his adventures. <b>The</b> <b>Prince</b> and the army of his father Shahraman are passing through India to visit the Sultan of Azad. The Vizier of a local Maharaja, wanting to prevent his death using a substance known as the Sands of Time, entices them into attacking the Maharaja's palace, where the Sands are stored. During the fight, <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> loots an artefact called the Dagger of Time, and the Maharaja's daughter Farah is taken {{as a gift for}} the Sultan of Azad. Visiting Azad, the Vizier tricks <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> into releasing the Sands, turning everyone but <b>the</b> <b>Prince,</b> the Vizier and Farah (protected by the Dagger, a staff and an amulet respectively) into sand creatures. The Vizier attempts to seize the Dagger from <b>the</b> <b>Prince,</b> but he escapes and eventually allies with Farah to undo the damage he has caused and prevent the Sands from covering the world, even though he has doubts about her loyalties and motives.|$|E

5|$|After some time, the king's {{designated}} successor, Andriambonimena, {{launched a}} retaliatory {{attack against the}} prince's half-brother Andrianentoarivo at Ambohipotsy and successfully chased him from his fief. Andriantomponimerina {{recognized the need to}} take more dramatic action to consolidate his grip on power and sent a messenger to the Sakalava king requesting his support. The Sakalava reaffirmed their loyalty to Andriamasinavalona, however, and threatened to attack <b>the</b> <b>prince</b> if the rightful king was not released from his captivity. According to one version of the oral history, having failed to use the king as a pawn to gain power, <b>the</b> <b>prince</b> decided to ransom his father for 7,000 piastres to increase his personal wealth. Every citizen of Imerina was obligated to contribute, and those who had no money sold their children or themselves into slavery in order to raise the necessary funds. The money was placed in seven baskets and transported by dugout canoe to <b>the</b> <b>prince</b> at Ambohidratrimo, who released the king. According to another version of the story, Prince Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana of Ambohimanga sent two hunters of the Tsimahafotsy clan to free the king by digging an escape passage under the wall of his heavily guarded enclosure. After returning to Antananarivo, Andriamasinavalona sent a messenger who announced that the king had decided to hand power to Andriantomponimerina and invited <b>the</b> <b>prince</b> to the capital to be enthroned. <b>The</b> <b>prince</b> hurried to the palace, and throughout the city he was greeted with cheers, singing and dancing. When Andriamasinavalona received him, however, he publicly condemned <b>the</b> <b>prince</b> and stripped him of his rank and power.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{the circle}} around <b>the</b> <b>prince,</b> however, Gaveston also became {{entangled}} in conflicts between the King and his son. These difficulties first materialised in a dispute between treasurer Walter Langton and Prince Edward.

Though the two were reconciled at a later point, the King still prevented Gaveston from rejoining <b>the</b> <b>prince.</b> This matter was settled before 26 May 1306, however, the date when Gaveston was knighted, four days after <b>the</b> <b>prince.</b> Later that year Gaveston was once more in trouble, when he and twenty-one other knights deserted a Scottish campaign to attend a tournament. An arrest order was sent out for the deserters, but, at the insistence of Queen Margaret, they were all pardoned in January 1307.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} Cornish and Devonian icons, clotted cream has become entrenched in local folklore.

Another myth, from Dartmoor, tells of a princess who wanted to marry an elven prince, but according to tradition had to bathe in pure cream first. Unfortunately, a witch who wanted <b>the</b> <b>prince</b> for her daughter kept souring the cream. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>prince</b> offered the princess clotted cream, which the witch was unable to sour.|$|E
5|$|At Swansea, the Tennant Canal {{could be}} relinked to <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> of Wales Dock, and hence to the River Tawe, {{which has become}} a large marina since the {{construction}} of a tidal barrage. This could then provide a link to a restored Swansea Canal. Associated British Ports, who run Swansea Docks, rejected the idea of a canal link in 1997, but since then <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> of Wales Dock has become the subject of a regeneration scheme, and a route for the canal has been reserved in the planning document. The feasibility of this scheme and a possible route was investigated in a report by the engineers W. S. Atkins published in 2003. A report for Natural Resources Wales by Trilein Ltd. recommended a range of initiatives to better connect the urban areas of the city to the more rural east of the county, including Crymlyn Bog. The reconnection of the Tennant Canal to <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> of Wales Dock was again outlined in that report.|$|E

Aylesford was appalled and decided to seek a divorce. Meanwhile, Lord Blandford's brother, Lord Randolph Churchill, persuaded the lovers against an elopement. Now concerned by the threat of divorce, Lady Aylesford sought to dissuade her husband from proceeding but Lord Aylesford was adamant and refused to reconsider. In an attempt to pressure Lord Aylesford to drop his divorce suit, Lady Aylesford and Lord Randolph Churchill called on Alexandra and told her that if the divorce was to proceed they would subpoena her husband as a witness and implicate him in the scandal. Distressed at their threats, and following the advice of Sir William Knollys and the Duchess of Teck, Alexandra informed the queen, who then wrote to <b>the</b> <b>Prince</b> of Wales. <b>The</b> <b>prince</b> was incensed.
