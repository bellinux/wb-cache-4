The drive employs a redundant lubrication system to increase its reliability. An overrunning clutch mechanism is used to permit block redundant application {{of two or more}} drives to a common array drive shaft. Two prototype actuator and clutch assemblies, in continuous vacuum life <b>test</b> <b>under</b> <b>load</b> at 10 to the minus 8 th power torr for more than sixteen months, have each accumulated more than 34, 000 output revolutions without anomaly, the equivalent of more than seven years of operation in a 1000 km orbit or nearly ninety-five years at synchronous altitude...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Material {{failures}} in heat exchangers are often {{closely tied to}} events associated with the conditions of service and operating parameters. These events can generally be attributed to adverse load application and higher than optimum operating temperatures {{that could lead to}} changes in the microstructure of the materials and fatigue failure of the component. However, fatigue failure in heat exchangers is usually associated with the presence of a biaxial stress condition. Two nonparallel forces create a two-dimensional stress field at the free surface of the structural element where the process and mechanism of fatigue failure normally initiate. An experimental investigation was conduct 6 d to evaluate the biaxial fatigue behavior of commercially pure titanium Ti- 50 A (Grade 2) and low-alloy titanium Ti-Code 12 (Grade 12) heat exchanger materials. The biaxial state of stress was composed of an axial stress and a superimposed torsional stress, applied in a thin-wall tubular specimen machined from titanium tubing. Torsional stress was applied independently using a torsion machine and a torque fixer assembly devised as part of this study. After applying the desired torsion, the torsionally stressed specimen was mounted on a closed-loop electrohydraulic machine for the application of axial cyclic loading. A minimum of four tests were conducted for each of three alternating stress levels at both high and low torsional stresses. The biaxial fatigue <b>test</b> <b>under</b> <b>load</b> control condition was done under fully reversed cycles equivalent to a biaxiality ratio of - 1. These test parameters were determined from an analytical formulation based on Mohr's circle. The results are presented in terms of the various measured or calculated quantities versus number of cycles to fracture. Biaxial fatigue curves were drawn through the experimental points corresponding to Weibull's mean life criterion. The four data points exhibit scatter that appears {{to be related to the}} applied stress amplitude. It was also found that a correlation exists between the magnitude of applied cyclic biaxial stress and fatigue life to failure. In addition, the results have been discussed taking existing failure criteria into account...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of studies dealing with FRP strengthened columns deal with columns of a circular cross section. Moreover, most concrete columns {{in the field}} have square or rectangular cross sections and resist eccentric loads as well.

A total of sixteen short square reinforced concrete columns wrapped with carbon FRP (CFRP) composites were investigated in this study.
