Kansas' following game was against Iowa State; this time, the Jayhawks won the game by a margin of nine points. The Jayhawks won their next four games before losing to Oklahoma State in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Due to the lack of a shot-clock in 1957, the Cowboys held the ball for the final three and a half minutes in order to win the game 5654. Both of the Jayhawks regular season losses were in part due to poor ball control by the Jayhawks. The Jayhawks squad closed out {{the regular season}} with four more victories.

Allen had 11points, but his Owls were upset by the Big Red 78-65. Following the season, Allen was selected to the All-Atlantic 10 First Team and All-Atlantic 10 Defensive Team. He was recognized as an All-Fourth District first-team selection by the National Association of Basketball Coaches making him eligible for the State Farm Division I All-America teams. Since the Atlantic 10 Conference was its own district, this is equivalent to being named first team All-Atlantic 10 by the NABC. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association named Allen to the 10-man All-District II team covering college basketball players in the states of New York, New Jersey, Delaware. the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{was awarded}} a {{scholarship}} by Santa Clara for the 1992–93 season. At that time, it had been five years since the Broncos appeared in the NCAA tournament. That changed when Nash led the Broncos to a WCC Tournament title and an upset win over the No. 2 seeded Arizona {{in the first round}} of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In that game, Nash scored six straight free throws in the last 30 seconds of the contest. Although Santa Clara was defeated by Temple in the next round, the 1992–93 campaign was considered a successful one. However, the Broncos failed to sustain the momentum the following season, and only managed a 5–7 record in the conference. The team rebounded in the 1994–95 season, with Nash being named Conference Player of the Year and the Broncos topping the WCC. Featuring the league leader for scoring and assists in Nash, the Broncos returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NCAA</b> <b>tournament,</b> but they were defeated by Mississippi State. After the season, Nash contemplated turning professional, and decided against it when he learned that he would probably not be considered as a first-round pick in the 1995 NBA draft.|$|E
5|$|The Georgetown Hoyas {{participated in}} the Great Alaska Shootout to start the 198182 season. The Hoyas lost their opening game to Southwestern Louisiana 7061 after playing a sloppy game. After winning the {{following}} game against, the Hoyas lost to Ohio State by one point in their {{final game of the}} tournament. Georgetown then began a thirteen-game win streak, which was followed by losing three straight to three conference opponents. The Hoyas then finished the regular season with nine more wins and one loss, which was good enough to finish second in the Big East regular season standings. The Hoyas won their first two games of the Big East Tournament by a collective margin of 29 points and advanced to the championship game against the Villanova Wildcats. The two teams were tied at halftime, but at halftime the Hoyas elected to use a man to man defense over a zone. This proved effective as they were able to force turnovers and shoot well from the field, which led them to win the game 7254. The Georgetown Hoyas won the Big East Tournament and also, a bid <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NCAA</b> <b>Tournament.</b>|$|E

5|$|The first NCAA Tournament was {{organized}} by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Oregon won the inaugural tournament, defeating Ohio State 46–33 in the first championship game. Before the 1941 tournament, control of the event {{was given to the}} NCAA. In {{the early years of the}} tournament, it was considered less important than the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), a New York City-based event. Teams were able to compete in both events in the same year, and three of those that did so—Utah in 1944, Kentucky in 1949, and City College of New York (CCNY) in 1950—won the NCAA Tournament. The 1949–50 CCNY team won both tournaments (defeating Bradley in both finals), and is the only college basketball team to accomplish this feat. By the mid-1950s, the NCAA Tournament became the more prestigious of the two events, and in 1971 the NCAA barred universities from playing in other tournaments, such as the NIT, if they were invited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NCAA</b> <b>Tournament.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{winning the}} PCC Northern Division, Oregon {{earned the right}} to play the winner of the Southern Division in a best-of-three playoff series, with the games held at McArthur Court. In {{addition}} to the PCC championship, the winner would gain a berth in the first NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, which the National Association of Basketball Coaches would run. The series was slated to be held between March 10–13, but a tie between California and Southern California for first place in the Southern Division necessitated a one-game playoff. Rumors began that the PCC championship series would be postponed by one week, which would have prevented the winner from competing in the NCAA Tournament; the event was scheduled to begin on March 20. In response, Oregon declared that they would not play if the series was scheduled to end after March 14. Despite the school's claim, it agreed to a rescheduling approved by PCC member schools, in which the series was set for March 16–18. Hobson declared that Oregon would accept an invitation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>NCAA</b> <b>Tournament,</b> following hints that the PCC champion might be passed over for a bid in favor of a PCC team that did not receive a shortened rest between games. California won the Southern Division playoff 42–36 over Southern California to become the Webfoots' opponent in the PCC championship series. Dick later noted that he considered it vital for Oregon to sweep the Golden Bears in two games, to avoid an overnight trip to San Francisco for the NCAA Tournament and secure an off day in the Webfoots' schedule.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina {{began their}} 195657 {{campaign}} with three straight victories {{by a wide}} margin of victory. In their fourth game, the Tar Heels traveled Columbia, South Carolina, to play against South Carolina, where the Gamecocks took the Tar Heels to overtime before North Carolina was able to come away with the victory by four points. Near the end of December, the Tar Heels participated in the annual Dixie Classic The Tar Heels won the classic, and also remained undefeated, after beating Wake Forest in the championship game. North Carolina then won five more games before going into double overtime against Maryland and winning the game 6561 to earn their seventeenth consecutive victory. In the following game, Duke and North Carolina were tied at 7373 before Tar Heel Kearns sank two free throws to give North Carolina a two-point lead before the game ended. The Tar Heels closed out the regular season with six more victories to end the season with a record of 240. North Carolina won their quarterfinal matchup in the ACC Tournament by twenty points to advance to the semifinals against Wake Forest. The Demon Deacons were ahead 5958 as the game entered the final minute. With time running out, Rosenbluth made a two-point shot and was fouled in the act of shooting, which sent him to the line to shoot a free throw; he made the free throw and the Tar Heels won 6159.
