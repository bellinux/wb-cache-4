The new test facility is the latest piece of the center's PHIL testing program. It has a 24,000-volt direct current with a capacity of 5 megawatts, making it the most powerful PHIL system of its kind at a university research center worldwide. To create the new system, the center put together four individual 6 kilovolt, 1.25 megawatt converters that can be arranged in any combination, in series or parallel connection, to form an extremely flexible test bed for medium voltage direct current (MVDC) system investigations.|$|E

At present, {{testing is}} the most modern method of {{knowledge}} control. A significant drawback of modern computer <b>testing</b> <b>systems</b> is their attachment to the platform and operating system on which it is implemented. In addition, {{there is a problem}} of <b>testing</b> <b>system</b> security, since each operating system has its own vulnerabilities that may affect the operation of the software. Therefore, it became urgent to develop such a <b>testing</b> <b>system,</b> which provides reliable protection for testing and has a flexible access system of candidates to the <b>testing</b> <b>system</b> without linking to a particular platform or operating system. We suggested implementation of the <b>testing</b> <b>system</b> using a cross-platform solutions that have ample opportunities to build secure systems with high security level, and web-technologies allowing the use of the <b>testing</b> <b>system</b> for any device connected to the Internet or LAN using one?s own web-server. We presented a structural scheme of the secure web-based <b>testing</b> <b>system</b> and relationship between its components. We considered development features of each software module of the web-based <b>testing</b> <b>system.</b> We considered problems of security provision for the <b>testing</b> <b>system,</b> and possible malicious attacks. We developed protection mechanisms for databases and the data transmitted in the <b>testing</b> <b>system.</b> All required cryptographic protection technologies, such as encryption, key exchange, authentication and digital signature were developed on the basis of own methods on a single mathematical apparatus of recurrent Vk sequences. This allowed us not only to improve the <b>testing</b> <b>system</b> security, but also to increase its speed of cryptographic transformations. ?? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ???????? ??????????? ??????? ???????? ??????. ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ???????????? ?????? ???????????? ???????? ?? ???????? ? ?????????? ? ???????????? ????????, ?? ??????? ??? ???????????. ????? ????? ?????????? ???????? ???????????? ?????? ????????????, ????????? ?????? ???????????? ??????? ????? ???? ??????????? ??????????, ??????? ????? ?????? ?? ?????? ???????????? ????????. ??????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ????? ??????? ????????????, ??????? ?? ???????????? ???????? ?????? ???????????? ? ??? ???? ????? ?????? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ? ??????? ????????????, ??? ???????? ? ?????????? ????????? ??? ???????????? ???????. ?????????? ?????????? ??????? ???????????? ? ?????????????? ?????-????????????? ???????, ??????? ????? ??????? ??????????? ??? ?????????? ?????????? ?????? ? ??????? ??????? ????????????, ? ????? ???-??????????, ??????????? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ?? ????? ??????????, ???????????? ? ?????????? ???? ???????? ??? ????????? ???? ? ?????????????? ???????????? ???-???????. ???????????? ??????????? ????? ?????????? ???-??????? ????????????, ? ????? ??????????? ????? ?? ????????????. ??????????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????? ???-??????? ????????????. ??????????? ???????? ??????????? ???????????? ??????? ????????????, ? ????? ????????? ????? ??????????????. ??????????? ????????? ?????? ???? ?????? ? ??????, ??????? ?????????? ? ??????? ????????????. ??? ??????????? ?????????? ????????????????? ??????, ??? ?? ??????????, ????????? ??????, ?????????????? ? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?? ?????? ??????????? ??????? ?? ?????? ?????????????? ???????? ????????????

In 2008, many of the 136 standalone distributed computers on board the B-2, including the primary flight management computer, were being replaced by a single integrated system. The avionics are controlled by 13 EMP-resistant MIL-STD-1750A computers, which are interconnected through 26 MIL-STD-1553B-busses; other system elements are connected via optical fiber.|$|E
25|$|An {{advantage}} of DFAT testing over reverberant testing is the portability of the DFAT system. This allows {{the test equipment}} to be transported to any location, setup, calibrated, used to perform a High Intensity Acoustic Test and then removed from the test site. The entire process from load-in to load-out can be accomplished in no more than 4 days for a large satellite or similar aerospace structure. The <b>test</b> <b>system</b> uses a “building block” approach to form combinations of equipment to satisfy the environmental requirements. Systems typically include 500 plus speakers, 2 million plus watts of amplification, at least 8 to 16 control microphones, and a closed-loop MIMO acoustic control and data acquisition system. The mobility and “building block” approach allows this method to be tailored for each application {{and to provide a}} more timely and cost effective test solution. This method can also be useful for testing articles that are too large to fit inside a traditional acoustic reverberant chamber.|$|E
