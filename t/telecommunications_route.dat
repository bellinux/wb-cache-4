5000|$|In {{computer}} {{networking and}} <b>telecommunications,</b> <b>route</b> flapping {{occurs when a}} router alternately advertises a destination network via one route then another (or as unavailable, and then available again) in quick sequence. A closely related term is interface flapping where an interface on a router has a hardware failure that will cause the router to announce it alternately as [...] "up" [...] and [...] "down".|$|E
50|$|The {{geomagnetic}} {{section of}} the Conrad Observatory is near completion. It serves the detection and investigation of the geomagnetic field {{as well as the}} development of measuring devices. The topics of research are the geomagnetic field's temporal variations and their consequences, e.g. navigation, climate. Geomagnetic storms caused by solar wind and solar flares (protuberances) are of high interest, too, because these events impact <b>telecommunications,</b> <b>route</b> guidance systems, electrical power supply stations, and safety systems.|$|E
5000|$|Communications in China were {{established}} {{rapidly in the}} early 1950s. By 1952 the principal telecommunications network centered on Beijing, and links to all large cities had finally been established. Work quickly got under way to repair, renovate and expand the system, and from 1956 <b>telecommunications</b> <b>routes</b> were extended more rapidly. To increase {{the efficiency of the}} communications system, the same lines were used for both telegraphic and telephone service, while Teletype and television (broadcasting) services were also added.|$|R

Stanley Angwin (2, 500 -ton gross) {{surveyed}} the route for the Tortola-Bermuda telephone cable which {{will provide the}} northern outlet for the 21 -million W.

40|$|At the country-wide level, {{core regions}} can clearly be discerned from {{peripheral}} regions in Croatia. The Zagreb region {{accounts for only}} 8. 7 % of Croatia''s surface area, yet its importance distinguishes it as a exceptional core region. A total of 27. 8 % of Croatia''s population lives in it (2001), while 29. 9 % of its working population is employed there (1991). In the city of Zagreb itself, the equivalent shares are approximately one sixth (17. 6 % of the population, 18. 2 % of all employed). Within the region itself, this concentration and centralization are even more marked, particularly in terms of labor. Zagreb accounts for approximately three fifths {{of the population and}} over three quarters of the employed of the wider Zagreb region, while the urban agglomeration, formed as a result of intensified suburbanization, encompasses approximately 80 % of the population and almost 90 % of the employed. Realistically, therefore, only the Zagreb urban region, i. e. the Zagreb agglomeration, can be referred to as a core region. Zagreb''s importance came to the forefront after Croatia attained independence in 1991. Zagreb then became the political center of the new state, which further enhanced its functions and deepened the differences between it and other cities. A large concentration of the country''s population, a high degree of urbanization and dynamic economic development, particularly in the tertiary sector, contributed to these processes considerably. A comparison of population trends in Zagreb and Croatia''s remaining three macro-regional hubs, Split, Rijeka and Osijek, additionally confirms the aforementioned processes. During the 1991 - 2001 period, the differences between Zagreb and these three remaining centers grew. Thus the ratio between Zagreb and the country''s second largest city, Split, increased from 1 : 3. 7 (1991) to 1 : 3. 9 (2001), while the ratio betwwen Zagreb and Rijeka went from 1 : 4. 2 to 1 : 4. 8, and between Zagreb and Osijek from 1 : 6. 7 to 1 : 7. 5. This ocurred under conditions marked by the considerable decline of Croatia''s population, which had less of an impact on the core region, while almost all other regions and large cities in Croatia were affected by depopulation. This means that the order of size of Croatian cities is even more irregular now than it was ten years ago and this in turn indicates increasing monocentrism. A further indicator is the number and share of business entities in Croatia: 75 % of the largest Croatian corporations (15 out of 20), 45 % of Croatia''s banks (21 out of 47) and 67 % of the largest Croatian retail/wholesale companies (12 out of 18) are headquartered in Zagreb. The most important transit routes are also centered in Zagreb, regardless of whether {{it is a matter of}} road, rail, air or <b>telecommunications</b> <b>routes.</b> However, the links between Zagreb and the remaining macro-regional centers, particularly Split, are unsatisfactory. In this manner, the remaining settlements are additionally left behind in integration with European developmental trends. Generally the overall economic development of other parts of Croatia considerably lags behind that of the central, Zagreb area, which is reflected in unequal regional development. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{telecommunications}} provider {{is usually}} {{aware of the}} required Grade of Service for a particular product. To achieve and maintain a given Grade of Service, the operator must ensure that sufficient <b>telecommunications</b> circuits or <b>routes</b> are available to meet a specific level of demand. It should also {{be kept in mind}} that too many circuits will create a situation where the operator is providing excess capacity which may never be used, {{or at the very least}} may be severely underutilized. This adds costs which must be borne by other parts of the network. To determine the correct number of circuits that are required, telecommunications service providers make use of Traffic Tables. An example of a Traffic Table can be viewed in Figure 1. It follows that in order for a telecommunications network to continue to offer a given Grade of Service, the number of circuits provided in a circuit group must increase (non-linearly) if the traffic intensity increases.|$|R
