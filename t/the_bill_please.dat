5000|$|In December 1992, White moved a {{resolution}} advocating {{the creation of}} a regulating body for social workers in Ontario. At the time, Ontario was the only province that did not have a regulating body for social workers. A spokesman for the Ministry of Social Services said that legislation for social work was a low priority. While he was not successful in getting a bill passed during his time as MPP, a similar <b>bill</b> called <b>the</b> Social Work and Social Service Work Act was enacted in 1998.

5000|$|Because {{of fellow}} quarterback John Elway's well-publicized {{reluctance}} {{to play for}} the Baltimore Colts, which chose him in the 1983 NFL Draft, Kelly's agent asked whether there were any teams he would not play for. Kelly, who disliked cold weather, listed the Minnesota Vikings, Green Bay Packers, and Buffalo <b>Bills.</b> He was <b>pleased</b> to see while watching the 1983 draft on television that <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> did not select him as the 12th pick in the first round, but learned from his agent that the team had another first-round pick; <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> chose Kelly as the 14th pick.

50|$|Each Bill {{consists}} of five main parts: the long title, the short title, the interpretation clause, {{the main body}} of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> and <b>the</b> objects and reasons. The long title is a description of the nature of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> and covers <b>the</b> intent of <b>the</b> <b>Bill.</b> <b>The</b> Short title follows the long title and labels <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> for identification purposes. The short title sometimes also, contains the commencement clause, which states when <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> will have legal force. The short title in turn is followed by the interpretation clause, which defines certain words and phrases used in <b>the</b> <b>Bill.</b> <b>The</b> body of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> {{consists of}} all of the other clauses, which contain the provisions of <b>the</b> <b>Bill,</b> that is, they contain all of the measures that <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> is enacting. <b>The</b> objects and reasons is the final part of a Bill and it seeks to explain in layman’s terms the purpose of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> and <b>the</b> reason why it is necessary.|$|R

5000|$|The {{reach of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights (beneficiaries, duties, time and territory) {{demarcates}} {{the types of}} legal disputes to which <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights directly applies.

In addition, and subject to considerations of justiciability and jurisdiction, <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights generates {{its own set of}} remedies.

50|$|Once the Parliament {{agrees to}} the general {{principles}} of a <b>Bill,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> progresses to Stage 2.

Occasionally, a Bill is transferred to a committee of the entire Scottish Parliament. <b>The</b> committees <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> is referred to then cover <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> in detail, and must agree on each individual portion (in contrast to Stage 1, where only the general idea of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> must be agreed on).

50|$|Once a {{bill has}} been {{approved}} in two debates in each house, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> {{is sent to the}} government (President) for its approval.

The delay for returning a bill with objections is 6 days (no more than 20 articles in <b>the</b> <b>bill),</b> 10 days (21-50 articles) or 20 days (over 50 articles). If the prescribed delay expires without the government having returned <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> with its objections, the President shall approve and promulgate it. If <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> is again adopted by an absolute majority of the members of both houses, the President must sign <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> without objection. However, if the President objected to <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for unconstitutionality, <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> will be sent, if the houses insist, to the Constitutional Court. The Court then has six days to rule on <b>the</b> <b>bill's</b> constitutionality; a favourable ruling forces the President to sign <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> an unfavourable decision defeats <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Patriots stay at {{home for}} a matchup against <b>the</b> Tyrod Taylor-led <b>Bills.</b> On <b>the</b> first play of scrimmage, Brissett hit Edelman on a 90-yard catch-and-run to <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> 1, but <b>the</b> play was nullified by a holding penalty on former Buffalo Bills player, Chris Hogan.
