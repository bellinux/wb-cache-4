They want to give President Obama a strong tongue-lashing and lick {{government}} spending".|$|R

30|$|In addition, we {{go beyond}} {{establishing}} differences in behavioral profiles of ties {{based on their}} levels of cognitive salience, and examine {{the question of whether}} the behavioral temporal signature of social ties differs depending on whether their nodes are linked in the nomination layer or not. We hypothesize that cognitive salient ties will also exhibit behavioral activity in days of the week and times of the day that are associated with informal sociability in <b>this</b> population (e.g., <b>weekends</b> <b>and</b> evenings), and that this feature differentiates them from ties whose nodes are disconnected in the nomination layer.|$|R

5000|$|... "It {{was just}} a really good night overall for the entire Stewart Haas organization, {{just a lot of}} hard work we have put in over the last few months just trying to get back to where we feel like we could win a race. We had good Top 5, Top 10 cars but just we were not able to get to victory lane. Tonight we had all the pieces together. We {{unloaded}} fast <b>this</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>and</b> Tony did an incredible job qualifying, starting up front makes all the difference in the world and good pit stalls and being able to help the guys out, all things combined, it was a good effort." [...] Darian Grubb, speaking after the race.|$|E
5000|$|... "It’s {{with heavy}} hearts and our deepest regrets that we {{announce}} {{we will be}} cancelling all future dates {{for the foreseeable future}} and the band will be taking an indefinite break starting immediately.

Our sincerest apologies to those of you looking forward to seeing us <b>this</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>and</b> at our other shows throughout the year. We’re gutted we can’t be there with you. We pray you will all understand and support us in what has been an incredibly hard decision to make, but a very necessary one all the same.|$|E

It would be inappropriate for NASCAR to comment on this case so we will continue to respect the process and authorities involved." ...|$|E
500|$|Australia {{finished}} the Games with two bronze medals. Jason Hellwig {{stated that the}} aim was to win between two and five medals. He said: [...] "wo medals absolutely is a pass ... so we're really pleased with that but we're absolutely disappointed we didn't get the mission done to win that gold medal, but I tell you what, we are absolutely determined to get it done in four years' time. It hasn't been easy, we've come in under the most difficult of circumstances that I've ever seen a team [...] at a major Games." [...] Chris Nunn, Chef de Mission, pointed to the future by stating that [...] "We really need to focus on having good-quality athletes who are robust and have financial support to get overseas. It's not like living in Austria, Sweden or Germany where you can do <b>this</b> on the <b>weekend</b> <b>and</b> after work." ...|$|R
