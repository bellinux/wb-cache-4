50|$|Unlike penicillins, {{which are}} {{rendered}} ineffective through rapid hydrolysis by the β-lactamase enzyme present in some strains of bacteria, <b>thienamycin</b> remains antimicrobially active. <b>Thienamycin</b> displayed high activity against bacteria that were resistant to other β-lactamase-stable compounds (cephalosporins), highlighting {{the superiority of}} <b>thienamycin</b> as an antibiotic among β-lactams.|$|E
50|$|Due to low titre and to {{difficulties}} in isolating and purifying <b>thienamycin</b> produced by fermentation, total synthesis {{is the preferred}} method for commercial production. Numerous methods {{are available in the}} literature for the total synthesis of <b>thienamycin.</b> One synthetic route is given in Figure 3.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thienamycin</b> {{also known}} as Thienpenem {{is one of the}} most potent {{naturally}} produced antibiotics known thus far, was discovered in Streptomyces cattleya in 1976. <b>Thienamycin</b> has excellent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and is resistant to bacterial β-lactamase enzymes.Thienamycin is a zwitterion at pH 7.|$|E

5000|$|In vitro, <b>thienamycin</b> {{employs a}} similar {{mode of action}} as {{penicillins}} through disrupting the cell wall synthesis (peptidoglycan biosynthesis) of various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa to name a few). [...] Although <b>thienamycin</b> binds {{to all of the}} penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) in Escherichia coli, it preferentially binds to PBP-1 and PBP-2, which are both associated with the elongation of the cell wall.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thienamycin</b> is {{extremely}} unstable and decomposes in aqueous solution. Consequently, it is impractical for the clinical treatment of bacterial infections, so stable derivatives were created for medicinal consumption. One such derivative [...] - [...] imipenem [...] - [...] was formulated in 1985. Imipenem, an N-formimidoyl derivative of <b>thienamycin,</b> is rapidly metabolized by a renal dipeptidase enzyme {{found in the}} human body. To prevent its rapid degradation, imipenem is normally coadministered with cilastatin, an inhibitor of this enzyme.|$|E
50|$|Imipenem was {{patented}} in 1975. It {{was discovered}} via a lengthy trial-and-error {{search for a}} more stable version of the natural product <b>thienamycin,</b> which is produced by the bacterium Streptomyces cattleya. <b>Thienamycin</b> has antibacterial activity, but is unstable in aqueous solution, so impractical to administer to patients. Imipenem has {{a broad spectrum of}} activity against aerobic and anaerobic, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is particularly important for its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Enterococcus species. It is not active against MRSA, however.|$|E
50|$|The {{gene cluster}} (thn) for the {{biosynthesis}} of <b>thienamycin</b> of S. cattleya was identified and sequenced in 2003, lending {{insight into the}} biosynthetic mechanism for <b>thienamycin</b> formation. The biosynthesis is thought to share features with the biosynthesis of the simple carbapenems, beginning with the condensation of malonyl-CoA with glutamate-5-semialdehyde to form the pyrroline ring. The β-lactam is then formed by a β-lactam synthetase, which makes use of ATP, providing a carbapenam. At some later point, oxidation to the carbapenem and ring inversions must occur.|$|E
50|$|Streptomyces cattleya is a Gram-positive {{bacterium}} {{which makes}} cephamycin, penicillin and <b>thienamycin.</b> The bacterium expresses a fluorinase enzyme, and the organism {{has been used}} to understand the biosynthesis of fluoroacetate and the antibacterial 4-fluoro-L-threonine.|$|E
50|$|Carbapenem {{antibiotics}} {{were originally}} developed at Merck & Co. from the carbapenem <b>thienamycin,</b> a naturally derived product of Streptomyces cattleya. Concern has arisen {{in recent years}} over increasing rates of resistance to carbapenems, as there are few therapeutic options for treating infections caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria (such as the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Klebsiella pneumoniae).|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of <b>thienamycin</b> {{is thought to}} occur through a different pathway from classic β-lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins). Production of classic β-lactams in both fungi and bacteria occur through two steps: First, the condensation of -cysteine, -valine, and -α-aminoadipic acid by ACV synthetase (ACVS, a nonribsomal peptide synthetase) and then cyclization of this formed tripeptide by isopenicillin N synthetase (IPNS).|$|E
50|$|From the 1960s {{into the}} 1990s Merck and Co. used a {{spheroplast}} screen {{as a primary}} method for discovery of antibiotics that inhibit cell wall biosynthesis. In this screen devised by Eugene Dulaney, growing bacteria were exposed to test substances under hypertonic conditions. Inhibitors of cell wall synthesis caused growing bacteria to form spheroplasts. This screen enabled the discovery of fosfomycin, cephamycin C, <b>thienamycin</b> and several carbapenems.|$|E
5000|$|In 1976, {{fermentation}} broths {{obtained from}} the soil bacterium Streptomyces cattleya {{were found to be}} active in screens for inhibitors of peptidoglycan biosynthesis. [...] Initial attempts to isolate the active species proved difficult due to the chemical instability of that component. After many attempts and extensive purification, the material was finally isolated in >90% purity, allowing for the structural elucidation of <b>thienamycin</b> in 1979 (Figure 1).|$|E
50|$|<b>Thienamycin</b> was {{the first}} among the {{naturally}} occurring class of carbapenem antibiotics to be discovered and isolated. Carbapenems are similar in structure to their antibiotic “cousins” the penicillins. Like penicillins, carbapenems contain a β-lactam ring (cyclic amide) fused to a five-membered ring. Carbapenems differ in structure from penicillins in that within the five-membered ring a sulfur {{is replaced by a}} carbon atom (C1) and an unsaturation is present between C2 and C3 in the five-membered ring.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydroxyethyl}} {{side chain}} of <b>thienamycin</b> {{is thought to}} be a result of two separate methyl transfers from S-adenosyl methionine. According to the proposed gene functions, ThnK, ThnL, and ThnP could catalyze these methyl-transfer steps. A β-lactam synthetase (ThnM) is thought to catalyze the formation of the β-lactam ring fused to the five-membered ring. How the cysteaminyl side-chain is incorporated is largely unknown, although ThnT, ThnR, and ThnH are involved in the processing of CoA to cysteamine for use in the pathway. Various oxidations complete the biosynthesis.|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of intravenously administered N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> (MK 0787) {{were studied}} in 14 healthy male subjects in a single-dose study, {{in which the}} volunteers received N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> with and without probenecid, and in a multiple-dose study, in which the subjects were given 250 or 500 mg every 8 h for 10 doses. High dose-related plasma concentrations of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> were achieved; co-administration with probenecid resulted in only minor increases in these concentrations. No accumulation in plasma was seen after multiple doses. The plasma half-life of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> was slightly less than 1 h and did not increase significantly with the coadministration of probenecid. The urinary recovery of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> varied between 6. 0 and 38. 4 % of the dose with a marked intersubject variability. Variations in individual subjects were small, however, when the urinary recoveries after repeated doses were compared. These results were in agreement with previous animal studies showing a renal metabolism of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin.</b> Probenecid administration resulted in a marked decrease in N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> urinary recovery. In vitro experiments showed that the decay of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> in spiked pretreatment urine samples was 2 to 5 %/h with more rapid degradation at acidic than at basic pH...|$|E
40|$|N-Formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> (MK 0787) {{undergoes}} renal metabolism by a dipeptidase, dehydropeptidase I, {{located on}} the brush border of the proximal tubular cells. The effects of two inhibitors (MK- 789 and MK- 791) of dehydropeptidase I on the pharmacokinetics of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> were studied in 41 healthy subjects receiving various combinations of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> and MK- 789 or MK- 791. Both inhibitors affected the plasma kinetics of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> only to a small extent. Plasma concentrations and the area under the plasma concentration curve increased about 20 % with a proportional decrease in plasma clearance. Plasma half-life was not altered significantly. Coadministration of MK- 789 or MK- 791 resulted in uniform and marked increases in urinary recovery and renal clearance of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin.</b> Thus, at an N-formimidoyl thienamycin/MK- 791 ratio of 1 : 0. 25 or higher, the urinary recovery was about 72 % in all subjects, whereas it varied between 7. 7 and 43 % when N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> was given alone. The ratio of the N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> and MK- 791 doses affected response. At relatively higher doses of MK- 791, significant increases of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> urinary recovery, renal clearance, and urine concentrations occurred during the later part of the 10 -h observation period after each administration. At a 1 : 1 ratio of the two drugs, the inhibition of renal metabolism of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> was maintained for at least 8 h, whereas renal clearance declined as soon as 4 h after the administration of a 1 : 0. 25 ratio. The results indicated that MK- 789 and MK- 791 alter the renal excretion of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> from glomerular filtration plus tubular secretion to glomerular filtration only, possibly by competitively inhibiting the penetration of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> into the proximal tubular cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{antibacterial}} activity of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> (MK 0787) was evaluated in 335 clinical isolates of ampicillin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, 50 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 28 Acinetobacter spp., 50 Streptococcus faecalis strains, and 7 oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and was {{compared with the}} recently developed beta-lactam antibiotics mezlocillin, cefuroxime, cefazedone, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, and moxalactam. Among the gram-negative bacteria, N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> was less active than cefotaxime against Klebsiella, Serratia, and Proteus spp. but had comparable activity against Escherichia coli and Enterobacter strains. Activity of the <b>thienamycin</b> derivative was somewhat {{lower than that of}} moxalactam against most of the strains and superior to that of mezlocillin, cefuroxime, and cefoperazone. Moreover, N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> was the most active drug against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. and had activity comparable to that of ampicillin against Streptococcus faecalis. N-Formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> was bactericidal at concentrations less than twice the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in all gram-negative isolates tested. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci (MIC of oxacillin, greater than 4 micrograms/ml) were inhibited at low concentrations of the <b>thienamycin</b> derivative (90 % MIC, 0. 25 micrograms/ml); however, N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> was not bactericidal at the 90 % MIC.

All of the 285 isolates, {{with the exception of}} 1 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolate, were inhibited by a concentration of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> of {{less than or equal to}} 8 micrograms/ml. More than 50 % of all isolates were inhibited by the lowest concentration of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> tested (0. 125 micrograms/ml); 98 % of Staphylococcus aureus and 80 % of S. epidermidis isolates were inhibited by N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> at a concentration of 0. 125 micrograms/ml. Only 2 of 45 enterococci were not inhibited by 1 microgram of N-formimidoyl <b>thienamycin</b> per ml, and this drug was the most active agent tested against 162 gram-negative bacilli.

40|$|Abstractβ-lactam ring {{formation}} in carbapenem and clavam biosynthesis proceeds through an alternative mechanism to the biosynthetic pathway of classic β-lactam antibiotics. This involves {{the participation of}} a β-lactam synthetase. Using available information from β-lactam synthetases, we generated a probe for {{the isolation of the}} <b>thienamycin</b> cluster from Streptomyces cattleya. Genes homologous to carbapenem and clavulanic acid biosynthetic genes have been identified. They would participate in early steps of <b>thienamycin</b> biosynthesis leading to the formation of the β-lactam ring. Other genes necessary for the biosynthesis of <b>thienamycin</b> have also been identified in the cluster (methyltransferases, cysteinyl transferases, oxidoreductases, hydroxylase, etc.) together with two regulatory genes, genes involved in exportation and/or resistance, and a quorum sensing system.

40|$|The {{generation}} of non-thienamycin-producing mutants with mutations in the thnL, thnN, thnO, and thnI genes within the thn gene cluster from Streptomyces cattleya and {{their involvement in}} <b>thienamycin</b> biosynthesis and regulation were previously reported. Four additional mutations were independently generated in the thnP, thnG, thnR, and thnT genes by insertional inactivation. Only the first two genes were found {{to play a role}} in <b>thienamycin</b> biosynthesis, since these mutations negatively or positively affect antibiotic production. A mutation of thnP results in the absence of <b>thienamycin</b> production, whereas a 2 - to 3 -fold increase in <b>thienamycin</b> production was observed for the thnG mutant. On the other hand, mutations in thnR and thnT showed that although these genes were previously reported to participate in this pathway, they seem to be nonessential for <b>thienamycin</b> biosynthesis, as <b>thienamycin</b> production was not affected in these mutants. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) -mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of all available mutants revealed some putative intermediates in the <b>thienamycin</b> biosynthetic pathway. A compound with a mass corresponding to carbapenam- 3 -carboxylic acid was detected in some of the mutants, suggesting that the assembly of the bicyclic nucleus of <b>thienamycin</b> might proceed in a way analogous to that of the simplest natural carbapenem, 1 -carbapen- 2 -em- 3 -carboxylic acid biosynthesis. The accumulation of a compound with a mass corresponding to 2, 3 -dihydrothienamycin in the thnG mutant suggests that it might be the last intermediate in the biosynthetic pathway. These data, together with the establishment of cross-feeding relationships by the cosynthesis analysis of the non-thienamycin-producing mutants, lead to a proposal for some enzymatic steps during <b>thienamycin</b> assembly...|$|E
