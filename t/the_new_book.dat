However, around the same time, Crown Prince Taufa'ahau Tupou IV returned {{from a trip to}} Australia where he realized that some changes should be made to the written Tongan language. Morton began working on a revised draft, but felt unacquainted with Tongan grammar. For a year, he studied the language and finally completely his revision on March 15, 1945. The Tongan version of the Book of Mormon was published in April 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the novel brought Rand new {{publishing}} opportunities. Bobbs-Merrill offered to publish a nonfiction book expanding on the ethical ideas presented in The Fountainhead. Though this book was never completed, {{a portion of the}} material was used for an article in the January 1944 issue of Reader's Digest. Rand was also able to get an American publisher for Anthem, which previously had been published in England, but not in the United States. When she was ready to submit Atlas Shrugged to publishers, over a dozen competed to acquire <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>book.</b>|$|E

5|$|After A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords, Martin {{originally}} intended to write three more books. The fourth book, tentatively titled A Dance with Dragons, was to focus on Daenerys Targaryen's return to Westeros and the associated conflicts. Martin wanted to set this story five years after A Storm of Swords so that the younger characters could grow older and the dragons grow larger. Agreeing with his publishers early on that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> should be shorter than A Storm of Swords, Martin set out to write the novel closer in length to A Clash of Kings. A long prologue was to establish {{what had happened in}} the meantime, initially just as one chapter of Aeron Damphair on the Iron Islands at the Kingsmoot. Since the events on the Iron Islands were to have an impact in the book and could not be told with existing POV characters, Martin eventually introduced three new viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|By 1926 Joyce had {{completed}} the first {{two parts of the}} book. In that year, he met Eugene and Maria Jolas who offered to serialise the book in their magazine transition. For the next few years, Joyce worked rapidly on <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>book,</b> but in the 1930s, progress slowed considerably. This was due to a number of factors, including {{the death of his father}} in 1931, concern over the mental health of his daughter Lucia, and his own health problems, including failing eyesight. Much of the work was done with the assistance of younger admirers, including Samuel Beckett. For some years, Joyce nursed the eccentric plan of turning over the book to his friend James Stephens to complete, on the grounds that Stephens was born in the same hospital as Joyce exactly one week later, and shared the first name of both Joyce and of Joyce's fictional alter-ego, an example of Joyce's superstitions.|$|E
5|$|When Unearthed Arcana was {{released}} in July, Gygax's bet paid off, as <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> sold 90,000 copies in the first month. His novel also sold well, and he immediately published a sequel, Artifact of Evil. The financial crisis had been averted, but ironically Gygax had {{paved the way for}} his own downfall. In October 1985, the new manager, Lorraine Williams, revealed that she had purchased all of the shares of Kevin and Brian Blume—after Brian had triggered his own 700-share option. Williams was now the majority shareholder, and replaced Gygax as president and CEO. She also made it clear that Gygax would be making no further creative contributions to TSR. Several of his projects were immediately shelved and never published. Gygax took TSR to court in a bid to block the Blumes' sale of their shares to Williams, but he lost.|$|E
40|$|This essay investigates how the {{chapters}} of the interwar and the Second World War have changed {{in the high school}} history textbooks during the period from 1944 to 2008. In the study eleven history textbooks have been studied, most quantitatively but also qualitatively. For example the number of pages and rows devoted to different subjects and countries are compared in the books over time. The result of the study shows that there are some big changes over time but in most sections there are also big differences between the books, which make it harder to draw general conclusions. There are a lot more names, pictures and dates in <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> <b>books</b> compared to <b>the</b> older ones, although the number of different names is about the same in all the books. As for how much of the textbooks which are about the interwar and the Second World War there has been a little but discernible increase in <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> <b>books</b> compared with <b>the</b> older ones. As for the Scandinavian and Swedish history there have been almost no changes over time in the chapter of the interwar period, but a distinct increase of both areas in the chapter of the Second World War, in the books from the 21 th century. The disposition of the interwar period has also changed a little. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>books</b> write more about the great economic crisis, and less about the democracies. In the case of <b>the</b> democracies <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> <b>books</b> write less about the developments in Great Britain and France, but more about that in USA. When it comes to the dictatorships there are no general changes percentage but <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> <b>books</b> write more rows about <b>the</b> dictatorships. <b>The</b> <b>newer</b> <b>books</b> write more about Germany than the older, especially <b>the</b> two <b>newest</b> ones. In <b>the</b> space devoted to Soviet Union and Spain there are no clear changes over time while the space devoted to Italy and Turkey in the books has decreased with time. In the oldest books there was quite some space devoted to Japan then it decreased in some books but then increased and more is written about Japan in <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> <b>books.</b> As for China <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> <b>books</b> write less about the development in the country during interwar period than the older books. The two genocides, the Holocaust and the communists genocide, have quantitatively been given more space and have asserted themselves in the books headlines and been given own sections in <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> <b>books.</b> <b>The</b> number of pictures of the genocides has also increased, especially in the books of the 21 th century...|$|R

5|$|The first {{classic work}} about the Tang is the Old Book of Tang by Liu Xu (887–946) et al. of the Later Jin, who {{redacted}} {{it during the}} last years of his life. This was edited into another history (labelled <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Book</b> of Tang) in order to distinguish it, which was a work by the Song historians Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072), Song Qi (998–1061), et al. of the Song dynasty (between the years 1044 and 1060). Both of them were based upon earlier annals, yet those are now lost. Both of them also rank among the Twenty-Four Histories of China. One of the surviving sources of the Old Book of Tang, primarily covering up to 756, is the Tongdian, which Du You presented to the emperor in 801. The Tang period was again placed into the enormous universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, edited, compiled, and completed in 1084 by a team of scholars under the Song dynasty Chancellor Sima Guang (1019–1086). This historical text, written with 3 million Chinese characters in 294 volumes, covered the history of China {{from the beginning of the}} Warring States (403 BC) until the beginning of the Song dynasty (960).|$|E
5|$|As in {{the first}} Prayer Book, the origins and {{participants}} {{in the work of}} its revision are obscure, but it was clear that Cranmer led the project and steered its development. It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter. Late in 1550, the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision. The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine. New rubrics noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the curate, thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> removed any possibility of prayers for the dead, as such prayers implied support for the doctrine of purgatory. The Act of Uniformity 1552, which authorised the book's use, specified that it be exclusively used from 1 November. However, the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute, due to Dudley's intervention. While travelling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer, John Knox, then based in Newcastle. Impressed by his preaching, Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects. In a sermon before the king, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion. On 27 September 1552, the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it. He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy. On 22 October, the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so-called Black Rubric, which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion.|$|E

25|$|Despite Zheng Yin's high status, {{little is}} firmly {{established}} about his career {{except for the}} 705 to 710 time period—as, unusual for a chancellor, {{he did not have}} a biography in either the Old Book of Tang or <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Book</b> of Tang.

Toward the end of the dynasty, Li Zhirou was briefly put temporarily in charge of the Office of the Chancellors in 895 with the designation Quanzhi Zhongshu Shi (權知中書事) and therefore could be regarded as a chancellor as well (and was listed in the table of chancellors in <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Book</b> of Tang); similarly, Lu Guangqi went through two similar titles.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} expected effects on developed business models of introducing remote printing technology into <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand <b>book</b> publishing industry. Remote printing technology will both address and improve on {{the constraints of}} geographical proximity and market size, enabling <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand <b>book</b> publishing industry to collectively grow and experience future prosperity. Aspects of technological innovation and consumer behaviour are examined to explore issues surrounding geographic proximity and supply chain inefficiencies. Criteria are developed using Just-In-Time (JIT) theory and Supply Chain Management (SCM) to evaluate where remote printing technology might best be integrated in <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand <b>book</b> publishing industry’s supply chain. The mutual effects between remote printing technology adoption and the expected effects on business models are evaluated, identifying which model is expected to provide the most significant benefits in a New Zealand context. A case study of six <b>New</b> Zealand <b>book</b> industry respondents was conducted. Qualitative data was collected in semi-structured interviews with members associated within different sectors of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand <b>book</b> publishing industry. The interview data was supplemented with secondary data sources, including publicly available information about <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand <b>book</b> industry. A within-case and cross-case analysis was performed around the research identified above. By evaluating developed business models and assessing which model/s effectively address <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand context, remote printing offers brick-and-mortar booksellers the ability to better compete with offshore online booksellers. The expected effects remote printing technology will have on <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand <b>book</b> industry are presented.
