A total of 69 analysts from 20 countries examined a <b>test</b> <b>slide</b> by light microscopy, which contained Ambrosia pollen and pollen from other Asteraceae that could be recorded in the atmosphere at the same time of year (i. e. Artemisia, Iva, and Xanthium). Daily average pollen concentrations produced by individual participants were compared with the assigned value and the bias was measured by z-score. Both the assigned value and standard deviation for proficiency testing were calculated following the consensus value principle (ISO 13528 : 2005) from the results reported by all the participants in the test. It took a total of 531 days from when the exercise commenced until all 69 analysts reported their results. The most outliers were reported for Artemisia pollen concentrations followed by Xanthium and Iva. The poor results for Artemisia and Xanthium were probably caused by low concentrations on the <b>test</b> <b>slide</b> leading to larger bias due to the unequal distribution of pollen over the microscope slide. Participants performed the best in identifying and quantifying Ambrosia pollen. Performing inter-laboratory ring tests with the same sample is very time consuming and might not be appropriate for large-scale proficiency testing in aerobiology.

40|$|Aims: Methicillin {{resistant}} Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{is a major}} nosocomial pathogen {{in hospitals}} with hospital based outbreaks world-wide. The resistance to antimicrobial agents among Staphylococci is an increasing problem. The present study was carried out to estimate the prevalence of MRSA isolates in clinical specimens and to investigate the sensitivity pattern of those isolates against various antibiotics used for treating hospitalized patients. Attempt was also done {{to find out the}} percentage of Staphylococcus aureus having inducible clindamycin resistance (iMLS B) in our geographic area using D-test. We tried to ascertain the relationship between the isolates of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and inducible clindamycin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Place and Duration of the Study: An ongoing study (July 2013 - June 2014) in the Department of Microbiology, KIMS. Methodology: A total of 529 isolates of S. aureus were identified by standard laboratory procedures including catalase <b>test,</b> <b>slide</b> and tube coagulase tests, β- haemolysis on blood agar and growth on mannitol salt agar. Subsequently antibiotic sensitivity pattern of S. aureus were determined by Kirby Baeur’s disc diffusion method.

An appropriate knowledge on the current antibiotic susceptibility pattern of MRSA is essential for appropriate therapeutic scenario.

40|$|Brucellosis is {{a typical}} {{zoonotic}} disease caused by organisms of genus brucella, a potential bio-warfare agent. Humans become infected by ingestion of animal food products, direct contact with infected animals or inhalation of infectious aerosols. Different diagnostic tests, ranging from culture, serologic <b>test</b> (<b>Slide</b> Agglutination Test, Tube Agglutination Test, Antihuman Globulin Test, 2 -Mercaptoethanol Test, Fluorescent Polarization Test, ELISA) and numerous PCR-based assays are available. Brucellosis remains a worldwide veterinary, medical and economical problem (Mediterranean Basin, South and Central America, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, Caribbean and Middle East). There are no enough accessible reliable data concerning epidemiology and episootology of brucellosis in some countries in Central and Southeast Europe (Balkan region). According official and published data countries in Balkan region belongs to countries with: a) significant problems with brucellosis in animals and human as: Macedonia (sheep, goats and human), Greece and Turkey (sheep, goats, cattle and human), b) with less significant problems, but disease present in animals and human: Serbia & Montenegro (and Kosovo), Bosnia & Herzegovina and Albania, c) free from brucellosis as: Slovenia, Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria. Slovenia, Croatia and Romania had no brucellosis caused by B. melitensis or B. abortus and no human cases in last 10 years. In Bulgaria, occasionally, there are imported cases of human brucellosis (recent outbreak between shepherds from region of Sliven, who worked at a Greek farm, two of them have died).

However, financial and expert’s well supported, long-term, common programs to control, eradicate and prevent spreading the disease to countries and regions free from brucellosis, are necessity. ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether one ear of a profoundly deaf student could duplicate a response rate similar to the response rate achieved by the opposite ear on an auditory training program. The formal hypothesis of this study was: a student that reaches criterion level of acceptable performance in the right ear on one presentation of Auditory Training Program No. V will achieve the same criterion level of acceptable performance during the first presentation of the last twenty test slides of Auditory Training Program No. V to the left ear. In observation of clinical performance oft hearing impaired patients, it was reported that often the-discrimination score of one ear improves or remains the same after a hearing aid is fitted to that ear for a length of time. At the same time, the contralateral ear, i. e., the ear not fitted with a hearing aid, fails to maintain or improve its ability to respond to speech discrimination tests. Since a review of the literature failed to reveal any existing research explaining this observation, an investigation into this problem appeared warranted. Three subjects were selected for the {{purpose of this}} investigation, two males and one female. Each subject was a student in high school at the Oregon State School for the Deaf. Of the three subjects, two were juniors, and one was a senior. All three subjects possessed hearing levels below 110 dB (ISO 1964 standards). To evaluate the hypothesis, each subject was first given a pretest trial to determine the discrimination ability of each ear when presented with Auditory Program No. V. Then the right ear of all three subjects was trained to a predetermined criterion level of acceptable performance. For each day that a treatment phase was presented to a subject, the remaining successive subject(s) was/were given the twenty <b>test</b> <b>slide</b> sequence of the auditory training program. A post-test of the left ear followed the training of the right ear, and this was compared to the pretest score achieved by the left ear at the beginning of the treatment period. To support the hypothesis of this study, the left ear would have to demonstrate a response rate comparable to the trained right ear on one presentation of the training program. Results of the study indicate that the left ears of two of the subjects tested, obtained response rates comparable to the response rates achieved by their right ears. However, the results also showed that the left ear on the third subject tested failed to compare with the response rate obtained by his trained right ear. It was suggested that this gave added support to the reported clinical observations, since out, of the three treatment subjects tested, one subject was found who could not respond with the left ear. It was concluded that a more intense investigation of the research problem be considered. Suggestions were also given in regards to improving the multiple-base- line design utilized in this study...|$|E

Furthermore, because the microscopic method provides not only quantitative, but also qualitative information, such as the shape of bacilli, it has remained significant. We have previously developed and reported panel <b>test</b> <b>slides</b> made from polyacrylamide-based artificial sputum (PBAS) mixed with both cultured THP- 1 cells and nonpathogenic mycobacteria. In this paper, we report an improved preparation method for PBAS for panel <b>test</b> <b>slides</b> that provides a simplified method and enhanced availability with high consistency in each grade and in which only negative PBAS is prepared from polyacrylamide and cultured THP- 1 cells and mixed with graded formalin-fixed Mycobacterium tuberculosis solution (FFTBS) containing oral flora and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the slides. In the smears prepared using this improved method, the numbers (average ± standard deviation [SD]) of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in 300 fields (2 - by 3 -cm smear) in eight smears of each grade ranged from 5 to 9 (6. 4 ± 1. 4), from 59 to 88 (74. 6 ± 10. 0), from 503 to 912 (705. 0 ± 145. 7), and from 1, 819 to 3, 256 (2133. 3 ± 478. 0) in ±, +, ++, and +++ smears, respectively.
