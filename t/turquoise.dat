5|$|<b>Turquoise</b> {{was very}} {{important}} to the people of Chaco. Around 200,000 pieces of <b>turquoise</b> have been excavated from the ruins at Chaco Canyon, and workshops for local manufacture of <b>turquoise</b> beads have been found. The <b>turquoise</b> was used locally for grave goods, burials and ceremonial offerings. Over 15,000 <b>turquoise</b> beads and pendants accompanied two burials at Pueblo Bonito.|$|E
5|$|Found in grasslands {{and open}} {{woodlands}} dominated by Eucalyptus and Callitris trees, the <b>turquoise</b> parrot feeds mainly on grasses and seeds and occasionally flowers, fruit and scale insects. It nests in hollows of gum trees. Much of its habitat has been altered and potential nesting sites lost. Predominantly sedentary, the <b>turquoise</b> parrot can be locally nomadic. Populations {{appear to be}} recovering from a crash in the early 20th century. The <b>turquoise</b> parrot has been kept in captivity since the 19th century, and several colour variants exist.|$|E

5|$|<b>Turquoise</b> parrots are {{encountered}} in pairs or small groups consisting {{of parents and}} several offspring, though they may congregate into larger flocks of up to 75 predominantly juvenile birds outside the breeding season. As the breeding season nears, pairs separate out from these flocks. <b>Turquoise</b> parrots roost together communally in autumn and winter. At night they roost among the foliage of trees such as gums or wattles, anywhere from 1 to 8m (3–25ft) above the ground. They retreat to trees near their feeding areas during the day. The calls of the <b>turquoise</b> parrot have been little-studied; birds give a high-pitched soft contact call when feeding or in flight, while the alarm call {{has been described as}} a high-pitched zitting call. <b>Turquoise</b> parrots also chatter when settling to roost in the evening.|$|E
5|$|Copper oxide and {{carbonate}} {{are used}} add color in stain glass works, in glassmaking, and in ceramic glazes to impart <b>turquoise</b> blue, green, and brown colors.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, a {{paramyxovirus}} {{with some}} antigenic similarity to Newcastle disease was {{isolated from the}} brain of a <b>turquoise</b> parrot in the Netherlands. That year, many aviary species including several species of Australian parrot {{and members of the}} genus Neophema had exhibited neurological symptoms reminiscent of Newcastle disease. Like other members of the genus, the <b>turquoise</b> parrot is highly sensitive to avian paramyxovirus infection. It is one of many species of parrot that can host the nematode Ascaridia platyceri.|$|E

5|$|M. s. musgravei was {{described}} in 1922 by amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews as a separate species from the Lake Eyre Basin in central Australia. It is found in mulga and mallee country across much of South Australia and the southern Northern Territory. It has lighter blue or <b>turquoise</b> upperparts than the splendid fairywren, {{as well as a}} black rump. This is largely synonymous with what was known as M. callainus or the <b>turquoise</b> fairywren which had been collected by ornithologist Samuel White and named by John Gould in 1867. The original collection bearing the name callainus was deemed a hybrid between what is now called musgravei and melanotus, and hence musgravei was resurrected as the name for the <b>turquoise</b> fairywren.|$|E

5|$|In the 1900s Barney held early {{gatherings of}} the salon {{at her house}} in Neuilly. The {{entertainment}} included poetry readings and theatricals (in which Colette sometimes performed). Mata Hari performed a dance once, riding into the garden as Lady Godiva on a white horse harnessed with <b>turquoise</b> cloisonné.|$|E

5|$|Mount Elbert {{is part of}} the Sawatch Range, an uplift of the Laramide Orogeny which {{separated}} from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 million years ago. The tops of this range were heavily glaciated, leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues. For example, the base of Elbert on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and metamorphic rocks deposited when the glaciers receded, which lie on a lateral moraine. Further up the eastern side there is a large cirque with a small tarn. There are also lakes to both the north and south, <b>Turquoise</b> and Twin Lakes respectively; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines, and <b>Turquoise</b> Lake was created by the manmade Sugar Loaf Dam.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} is {{the production}} of colour by microscopically structured surfaces fine enough to interfere with visible light, sometimes in combination with pigments. For example, peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their microscopic structure makes them also reflect blue, <b>turquoise,</b> and green light, and they are often iridescent.|$|E

5|$|The <b>turquoise</b> parrot is a {{predominantly}} ground-based seed eater, foraging in clearings in open woodland, forest margins, and near trees in more open {{areas such as}} pastures. It occasionally feeds along road verges and rarely ventures onto lawns. Birds forage in pairs or small troops of up to thirty or even fifty individuals. Observations at Chiltern in Victoria indicated seasonal variation in flock size, with <b>turquoise</b> parrots foraging in groups of 5–30 in winter and 6–8 in spring and summer. Foraging takes place from {{early in the morning}} till late afternoon, with a break between midday and mid-afternoon. Birds prefer to feed in shaded areas, where they are better camouflaged in the grass.|$|E
5|$|Another gift {{in demand}} was the streamlined, oval-shaped Princess {{telephone}} {{introduced in the}} early 1960s. The phone came {{in a variety of}} colors, including pink, <b>turquoise,</b> and cream. When one of Mattel's Barbie doll outfits included a Princess phone as an accessory, a fashion trend was born. By 1963, many Baby Boomers had reached driver's license age and, for the first time, middle-class families splurged on cars for their offspring.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{named for}} Ridgway include the buff-collared nightjar, Caprimulgus ridgwayi (once known as Ridgway's whip-poor-will); the <b>turquoise</b> cotinga, Cotinga ridgwayi; the Caribbean {{subspecies}} of the osprey, Pandion haliaetus ridgwayi; a Big Island subspecies of the elepaio, Chasiempis sandwichensis ridgwayi; Ridgway's hawk, Buteo ridgwayi; {{and many other}} species and subspecies. The monotypic genus Ridgwayia is named for him; it consists of Aztec thrush, R. pinicola.|$|E

5|$|Four {{expedition}}s to the <b>turquoise</b> mines of Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai are dated to his reign by in-situ inscriptions. The latest {{took place in}} his ninth year on the throne and could be the last expedition of the Middle Kingdom, since the next inscription dates to Ahmose I's reign, some 200 years later.|$|E
