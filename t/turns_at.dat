5|$|Eldora Speedway, {{which opened}} in 1954, is {{considered}} to be one of 14 intermediate tracks on the Truck Series schedule, the others being Charlotte, Chicagoland, Dover, Homestead-Miami, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Michigan, Phoenix, Pocono, Rockingham and Texas. The track is a 0.5 mile (0.80km) oval with <b>turns</b> <b>at</b> a 24 degree banking, while the straightaways are 8 degrees. The track's grandstands can fit 17,782 spectators, and the hillside seating can fit an unlimited number of fans.|$|E
5|$|Cheetahs are diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), whereas the leopards, tigers, and lions are nocturnal (active mainly at night); diurnality allows better {{observation}} and {{monitoring of the}} animal. Hunting is the major activity throughout the day; peaks are observed during dawn and dusk indicating crepuscular tendencies. Groups rest in grassy clearings after dusk, though males and juveniles often roam around at night. The cheetah is an alert animal; individuals often inspect their vicinity at observation points such as elevations. Even while resting, they take <b>turns</b> <b>at</b> keeping a lookout.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, City Council Member Eric Ulrich, a Republican {{representing}} Ozone Park, {{came out}} against the plan as among other things, it prohibited left <b>turns</b> <b>at</b> Jamaica Avenue. He had been in favor of bus rapid transit along Woodhaven Boulevard, as he stated in a 2014 opinion editorial. The plan was modified in May 2016 {{in an effort to}} accommodate Ulrich's objections. It included restrictions on left-turns at only five intersections, including none at Jamaica Avenue. The left-turn restrictions were put into the plan to speed up travel times by eliminating the signal time allocated to split phasing—a traffic-signal setup where traffic in one direction has a green light, while the other directions of traffic have a red light, in order to allow drivers at the green light to turn left without conflicts from oncoming traffic. The restrictions also reduce conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Instead of banning left <b>turns</b> <b>at</b> Jamaica Avenue, the left turn bays would be re-engineered around the BMT Jamaica Line subway columns to decrease blind spots and collisions. Local community members were also opposed to the plan due to the reduction of traffic lanes along the boulevard's service roads from two lanes to a single lane.|$|E

5|$|Super Mario Bros. 3 {{includes}} a multiplayer option which allows two players to cooperatively {{play the game}} by taking <b>turns</b> <b>at</b> navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels; the first player controls Mario, while the other controls Luigi (a palette swap of Mario). Through this mode, players can access several mini-games, including a remake of the original Mario Bros. arcade game, in which one player {{has the opportunity to}} steal the cards of another but may lose their turn if they lose the mini-game.|$|E
5|$|The next {{stretch of}} State Route 664 {{is full of}} bends, and the highway {{continuously}} <b>turns</b> <b>at</b> a constant rate. At an intersection with another Honey Suckle Lane, the highway starts its northwestern progression once again. This changes again when Tedrow Lane begins paralleling the highway. Now following a steady northeastern alignment, the highway continues through the large patches of trees south of Haneyville. At Little Plum Run Road, the highway turns onto a steady northward alignment. The highway continues through the trees for a while, continuing northward {{on its way to}} Gallagher Township.|$|E
5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was the <b>turns</b> <b>at</b> the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could be done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} NY252 in Henrietta between Marketplace Drive and Ridgeland Road was widened {{from four to}} six lanes {{as part of a}} multi-year, $15.6million project that began in mid-2009. Phase one of the five-phase project, {{completed}} {{during the second half of}} 2009, involved the relocation of utility poles and water mains. The next four phases involved the actual widening of the highway. During phase two, all traffic on Jefferson Road was routed along the eastbound lanes while the westbound half of the road was reconstructed and widened; this was reversed during phase three. A raised median between the two directions, which prohibited left-hand <b>turns</b> <b>at</b> all points except signalized intersections, was constructed during phase four, and phase five covered the finishing touches of the project. As part of the project, the intersection between Jefferson Road and East Henrietta Road (NY15A) was widened to have two dedicated left turn lanes in all four directions. Work on the last four phases began on March29, 2010, and was expected to be fully completed in November 2011. Construction did get completed in November 2011, but at the cost of $16.5million (2012USD) instead of the original $15.6million.|$|E
5|$|Until 2007, US-89 {{followed}} State Street to North Temple (100 North), {{two blocks}} from the capitol, but now it <b>turns</b> <b>at</b> 400 South, following the former alignment of SR-186 and SR-176 west and north on 300 West, and rejoining its pre-2007 route at North Temple. In this area, modern US-89 runs for one block with the UTA TRAX Red Line in its median before crossing the TRAX line in Main Street's median, then passing the Frank E. Moss United States Courthouse, Pioneer Park, the historic Warehouse District at Pierpont Avenue, Japantown, EnergySolutions Arena, the Arena TRAX station, the Triad Center, and West High School. As it leaves downtown, 300 West curves northwesterly and becomes Beck Street, meeting the modern terminus of SR-186 at Victory Road at the back side of Capitol Hill.|$|E

For example, if teams consist of players 1 and 2 versus players 3 and 4, and player 1 breaks, turns alternate {{in the pattern}} 1 (breaking), 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2, 4, etc. I.e., the ending of a player's <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> the table ends that team's <b>turn</b> <b>at</b> the table.

25|$|Boots {{and wraps}} are worn by almost all horses, {{due to the}} fact that they may easily injure their legs when landing or when making tight <b>turns</b> <b>at</b> speed. Open-fronted tendon boots usually are worn on the forelegs, because they provide {{protection}} for the delicate tendons that run down the back of the leg, but still allow the horse to feel a rail should it get careless and hang its legs. Fetlock boots are sometimes seen on the rear legs, primarily to prevent the horse from hitting itself on tight turns.|$|E
25|$|Whereas a {{helicopter}} works by forcing the rotor blades through the air, drawing air from above, the autogyro rotor blade generates lift {{in the same}} way as a glider's wing by changing the angle of the air as the air moves upwards and backwards relative to the rotor blade. The free-spinning blades turn by autorotation; the rotor blades are angled so that they not only give lift, but the angle of the blades causes the lift to accelerate the blades' rotation rate, until the rotor <b>turns</b> <b>at</b> a stable speed with the drag and thrust forces in balance.|$|E
