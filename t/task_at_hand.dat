5|$|Another problem {{exposed by}} Rolling Thunder was the unpreparedness of the Air Force for the {{operations}} it was undertaking. Its aircraft {{had been designed}} and its pilots trained for strategic operations against the Soviet Union – for nuclear, not conventional war. The new campaign exposed years of neglect in conventional tactics, while aircraft capabilities and armament were ill-suited to the <b>task</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> The Air Force was also embarrassed {{by the fact that}} the Navy was better prepared. It possessed the only all-weather bomber in the U.S. inventory in the new A-6 Intruder and was also responsible for the development of the F-4 Phantom fighter-bomber, which became ubiquitous during the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Tool use in orangutans was {{observed}} by primatologist Birutė Galdikas in ex-captive populations. In addition, evidence of sophisticated tool manufacture and {{use in the}} wild was reported from a population of orangutans in Suaq Balimbing (Pongo abelii) in 1996. These orangutans developed a tool kit for use in foraging that consisted of both insect-extraction tools {{for use in the}} hollows of trees and seed-extraction tools for harvesting seeds from hard-husked fruit. The orangutans adjusted their tools according {{to the nature of the}} <b>task</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> and preference was given to oral tool use. This preference was also found in an experimental study of captive orangutans (P. pygmaeus).|$|E
5|$|Woodfull {{was known}} for his gentlemanly nature and his {{adherence}} to the spirit of the game. Aside from refusing to retaliate against bodyline, Woodfull refused to exploit loopholes to dismiss batsmen. On one occasion, Jack Fingleton was run out after wandering out of the crease to inspect the crease, without intending to run. A teammate broke the wicket and the umpire upheld the appeal, but Woodfull called Fingleton back. He led his team in an understated way, preferring to give broad objectives to his players and trusting them to choose their own methods to fulfil the <b>task</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> However, he was known to organise his team tightly on tour to ensure that things proceeded smoothly.|$|E

5|$|One day, Zhou surprises the {{children}} with a written exam and leaves the classroom to speak with a visitor. Wang's son, Wang Gui (王贵), tricks their maid's son, Yue Fei, into completing their assignment while they go outside to play. After easily finishing the <b>task</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> Yue writes a heroic poem on a whitewashed wall and signs it with his name. The children then burst into the classroom upon learning of Zhou's forthcoming return and tell Yue to escape {{in order to avoid}} apprehension. The old teacher eventually discovers the ruse and, after marveling at Yue's impromptu ballad, asks Yue to fetch his mother, Lady Yao (姚夫人), for an important meeting. With the entire Wang household assembled in the main hall, Zhou asks the Lady for her blessing to have the boy as his adopted son and student. She consents and Yue takes his seat amongst Zhou's students the following morning. Because Zhou knows Yue is poor, he commands the four students to become sworn brothers. Zhou also begins to teach Yue all of the eighteen weapons of war.|$|E
25|$|Although {{restoring}} the person's weight {{is the primary}} <b>task</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> optimal treatment also includes and monitors behavioral change in the individual as well. There {{is some evidence that}} hospitalisation might adversely affect long term outcome.|$|E

25|$|Micheltorena {{eventually}} {{made it to}} Monterey, {{but was unable to}} control his troops, a number of whom were convicts. This fomented rumors of a revolt, and by 1844, Alvarado himself became associated with the malcontents and an order was given by Micheltorena for his arrest. His detention, however, was short-lived as Micheltorena was under orders to organize a large contingent in preparation for war against the United States. All hands would be required for the <b>task</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the basic}} {{assumption}} of fight-flight, the group behaves {{as though it}} has met to preserve itself at all costs, and that this can only be done by running away from someone or fighting someone or something. In fight, the group may be characterized by aggressiveness and hostility; in flight, the group may chit-chat, tell stories, arrive late or any other activities that serve to avoid addressing the <b>task</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> The leader {{for this sort of}} group is one who can mobilize the group for attack, or lead it in flight.|$|E
25|$|The {{commitment}} made selecting one {{or another}} ontology can produce a sharply different view of the <b>task</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> Consider the difference that arises in selecting the lumped element view of a circuit rather than the electrodynamic view of the same device. As a second example, medical diagnosis viewed in terms of rules (e.g., MYCIN) looks substantially different from the same task viewed in terms of frames (e.g., INTERNIST). Where MYCIN sees the medical world as made up of empirical associations connecting symptom to disease, INTERNIST sees a set of prototypes, in particular prototypical diseases, to be matched against the case at hand.|$|E
50|$|The final {{fundamental}} assumption evaluates one’s self as a positive, moral, {{and excellent}} individual.

5000|$|A novel form of {{workplace}} deviance {{has emerged in}} recent years, as technology becomes a bigger part of people's work lives. Internet workplace deviance (or [...] "cyber loafing") has become another way for employees to avoid the <b>tasks</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> This includes surfing the web and doing non-work-related tasks on the internet such as chatting on social-networking sites, online shopping and other activities.|$|R
25|$|When {{an older}} {{individual}} is completing a task, {{such as having}} a conversation or doing work, they are using their working memory to help them complete this task. As they age, their ability to multi-task seems to decline; thus after an interruption it is often more difficult for an aging individual to successfully finish the <b>task</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> Additionally, working memory {{plays a role in}} the comprehension and production of speech. There is often a decline in sentence comprehension and sentence production as individuals age. Rather than linking this decline directly to deficits in linguistic ability, it is actually deficits in working memory that contribute to these decreasing language skills.|$|E
25|$|Speed of {{processing}} is another theory {{that has been}} raised to explain working memory deficits. As a result of various studies he has completed examining this topic, Salthouse argues that as we age our speed {{of processing}} information decreases significantly. It is this decrease in processing speed that is then responsible for our inability to use working memory efficiently as we age. The younger persons brain is able to obtain and process information at a quicker rate which allows for subsequent integration and manipulation needed to complete the cognitive <b>task</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> As this processing slows, cognitive tasks that rely on quick processing speed then become more difficult.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of the NVA/PAVN fighter. Compared {{to their}} VC {{counterparts}} most NVA {{had a higher}} standard of literacy. While his preparation was not especially impressive by Western standards, the typical NVA soldier proved more than adequate for the <b>task</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> NVA training was surprisingly conventional, with little special emphasis on jungle warfare. Most of the troops' learning occurred on the job. Service and indoctrination under the communist system prior to army recruitment made the typical NVA fighter a bit older and more seasoned than his American or ARVN opponent. Throughout the conflict, NVA defections and surrenders were extremely low, especially compared to that of the VC, a testimony to their motivation and organization.|$|E

25|$|With the new {{emphasis}} on Gulag as the means of concentrating cheap labor, new camps were then constructed throughout the Soviet sphere of influence, wherever the economic <b>task</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand</b> dictated their existence (or was designed specifically to avail itself of them, such as the White Sea-Baltic Canal or the Baikal Amur Mainline), including facilities in big cities — parts of the famous Moscow Metro and the Moscow State University new campus were built by forced labor. Many more projects during the rapid industrialization of the 1930s, war-time and post-war periods were fulfilled {{on the backs of}} convicts. The activity of Gulag camps spanned a wide cross-section of Soviet industry. Gorky organised in 1933 a trip of 120 writers and artists to the White Sea–Baltic Canal, 36 of them wrote a propaganda book about the construction published in 1934 and destroyed in 1937.|$|E
25|$|Motivation is {{a factor}} that {{encourages}} a person to perform and succeed at the <b>task</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b> In an experiment done by Roebers, Moga and Schneider (2001), participants were placed in either forced report, free report or free report plus incentive groups. In each group, {{they found that the}} amount of correct information recalled did not differ, yet in the group where participants were given an incentive they had higher accuracy results. This means that presenting participants with an encouragement to provide correct information motivates them to be more precise. However, this is only true if the perception is that success is providing correct information. When it is believed that success is the completion of the task rather than the accuracy of that completion, the number of responses is higher, yet its accuracy is lowered. This shows that the results are dependent on how success is defined to the participant. In the referred experiment, the participants that were placed in the forced response group had the lowest overall accuracy; they had no motivation to provide accurate responses and were forced to respond even when they were unsure of the answer. Another study done by Hill RD, Storandt M, and Simeone C tested the impact of memory skills training and external reward on free recall of serial word lists. Effects similar to those reported in the previous study were seen in children—in contrast to older learners.|$|E

50|$|In its entirety, the Constitution came to {{resemble}} those of other francophone African states that were also adopted {{under the influence of}} General Charles de Gaulle's Fifth Republic and in response to the perceived need for strong, centralized leadership. In light of the highly fragmented polities typical of much of sub-Saharan Africa at that time, however, a system of checks and balances was thought to be overly cumbersome for the immediate <b>tasks</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
50|$|Human {{multitasking}} is {{an apparent}} human {{ability to perform}} more than one task, or activity, over a short period (1 hour). An example of multitasking is taking phone calls while typing an email and reading a book. Multitasking can result in time wasted due to human context switching and apparently causing more errors due to insufficient attention. Studies have shown {{that it is impossible}} to focus on more than one <b>task</b> <b>at</b> a time. However, if one is proficient at one of the <b>tasks</b> <b>at</b> <b>hand,</b> then it is possible to do these tasks.|$|R
