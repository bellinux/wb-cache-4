40|$|Many {{pleasure}} {{trips are}} often {{characterized by the}} visit {{of more than a}} single destination. Despite the topic is well documented in literature, the empirical studies are limited to a few pioneering studies. This lack may be attributable to the failure of tourism organizations to collect data on multi-destination trip behaviors, as it results, for example, from the system of European statistics on tourism (according to the Council Directive 95 / 57 EC), where no information on the average number of destinations visited within a single trip are provided. This paper aims to analyze <b>the</b> <b>main</b> implications of multi-destination trips both on tourism statistics and in tourism planning, and to describe the research design and the solutions adopted for the analysis of incoming tourism in Sicily. Some results related to the number of destinations visited and on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> travel <b>itineraries</b> undertaken by tourists in Sicily derived from the survey are presented...|$|R

40|$|A geogrid {{reinforced}} {{steep slope}} was built and monitored during construction {{and during the}} first ten months of service. The slope is located between Régua and Reconcos in <b>the</b> new Portuguese <b>main</b> <b>itinerary,</b> IP 3, and {{is a part of}} reestablishment 2. The reinforced slope has an extension of about 206. 2 ?m, is in curve and the reinforced area reaches a maximum height of about 19. 6 ?m in the outside curve slope at 150. 0 ?m of extension (km 0 + 150). The monitored slope cross section is at km 0 + 150. The reinforcements are high density polyethylene geogrids;. materials with different tensile strength values were used. The reinforcement strains were measured at three reinforcement levels using linear extensometers. The soil vertical stresses were recorded using load cells. The internal horizontal displacements of the slope were recorded using two inclinometer tubes. The face displacements were recorded topographically in points spaced approximately 1. 2 ?m vertically along the face of the slope on the km 0 + 150 cross section. The reinforced slope behaviour was observed during a period of about 13 months, which includes three months of construction period. This way it was possible to obtain information about the slope behaviour during and after construction (the first 10 months of service). The behaviour of the observed reinforced slope is characterized by: low values of face displacements, slope internal horizontal displacements and reinforcement strains; change of the face displacements configuration at the end of construction during service;tendency to stabilization of the horizontal displacements in {{a relatively short period of}} service; change, during service, of the position of the line passing through the points of the reinforcements where maximum strains were recorded. The reinforced slope behaviour express the conservative design of Equilibrium Limit methods and encourage the research on new design methods for geosynthetic reinforced soil system...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{describe}} the medical itineraries followed by breast cancer women affiliated to the People's Health Insurance in San Luis Potos&# 237;, central Mexico. We used an ethnographic approach based on oral histories of 12 women {{diagnosed with breast cancer}} in the year prior to the first meeting. Two face-to-face sessions per participant lasting 60 minutes each were conducted followed by a telephone interview. Content and diachronic analyses were used. Three <b>main</b> <b>itineraries</b> were identified: (1) diagnostic process, (2) final diagnosis to treatment, and (3) cancer control and relapse. Findings suggested that infrastructure and human resources to adequately screen and timely diagnose breast cancer were scant and insufficiently trained, respectively. Deferral of medical assessment was related with lack of information about breast cancer consequences, with women being afraid of a positive result, and with economic constraints. The current screening program needs to be redesigned to prevent diagnostic delays, as these seem to explain the high frequency of advanced stages reported at the time of diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of three <b>main</b> <b>itineraries</b> between <b>the</b> capital of Lusitania and the maritime harbour of Olisipo is attested to by archaeological evidence and by written, literary and epigraphic sources from the Roman period. Among {{this group of}} written sources, the text known as the Antonine <b>Itinerary</b> is <b>the</b> <b>main</b> document. <b>The</b> object of study {{is one of these}} itineraries, connecting Augusta Emerita to Olisipo through Ebora. The interpretation of the Antonine Itinerary, a group of texts known through its medieval copies, is still open to debate in current scientific research. There are several views regarding its nature and purpose, chronology and, especially, regarding the correspondence between the itineraries descriptions and the road network, which indeed existed in the territory during the Roman period. In order to overcome these difficulties of interpretation, it seems relevant to understand the topological nature of the Antonine Itinerary and seek to understand the data structure that it presents. Therefore, this thesis revises current available information, in order to define, within the territory, a plausible route, relying on archaeological, epigraphic and historical data. Starting with the definition of a route and of a wide band encircling the conventional representation of it’s axis, it seeks to understand {{the manner in which the}} itinerary is articulated with the occupation and organisation of the territory. The analysis of the information thus analysed culminated in a proposal of interpretation of the sequence of mile indications for this path in the Antonine Itinerary: it defends the thesis that the numerals expressed in these sequences correspond to distances between stations, in a counting scheme limited to boundaries of administrative territory within the route. In other words, it defends that the mile indications have their origin in the capital of each territorial unit, irradiating from this caput uiae in the different directions of the roads until they reached the territory of the adjoining city...|$|R

She set sail on her first inaugural cruise from Miami, Florida, on 1 June 1980, a 7-day cruise with only two stops, one in Little San Salvador then followed by a stop in St. Thomas, USVI. The other days of the cruise were sea days as the Norway was the destination itself. This remained her <b>main</b> <b>itinerary</b> from 1980 to 1982 until NCL announced Nassau, Bahamas was added. By 1985 St. Maarten, Netherlands Antilles was added. In 1987 her new itinerary was introduced: a 7-day cruise from Miami stopping at St. Maarten, St. John, USVI; St. Thomas and Great Stirrup Cay. Her Western Caribbean cruises later introduced were 7-days stopping at Cozumel, Mexico; Grand Cayman, Cayman Islands; Roatan and NCL's private island Great Stirup Cay. Between regular cruising in the Caribbean and dry dock periods, she sailed many cruises to Western Mediterranean, Western Europe coast, Northern Europe, the British Isles and the Norwegian fjords.|$|R
