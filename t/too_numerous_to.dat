5|$|The Seven Dwarfs made rare {{appearances}} in shorts, despite their popularity; they simply were <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> <b>to</b> animate efficiently. Commissioned shorts The Standard Parade (1939), The Seven Wise Dwarfs (1941, using mostly recycled footage), All Together (1942) and The Winged Scourge (1943) all include appearances.|$|E
5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> <b>to</b> be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E

50|$|Bits and Bobs also is English {{slang for}} a {{collection}} of small items <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> or varied <b>to</b> name individually. It originated from carpenters' tool kits containing parts for a drill, with bits used for making holes while bobs are routing or screwdriving drill attachments.

25|$|The {{subjects}} {{found on}} the face of postage stamps are generally what defines a particular stamp issue to the public and are often a reason why they are saved by collectors or history enthusiasts. Graphical subjects found on postage stamps have ranged from the early portrayals of kings, queens and presidents to later depictions of ships, birds and satellites, famous people, historical events, comics, dinosaurs, hobbies (knitting, stamp collecting), sports, holiday themes, and a wealth of other subjects <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> <b>to</b> list.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the title}} page Stewart {{immediately}} starts with the theme, quoting Ecclesiastes 1:4 — [...] "Men go and come, but earth abides." [...] For {{the first half of}} Earth Abides, George R. Stewart concentrates on a major theme for the book, that humans have no privileged place in nature and are not immune to nature's built-in population controls. The main character, an ecologist, states it plainly, [...] "When anything gets <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> it's likely <b>to</b> get hit by some plague".|$|R
40|$|Pressure {{to force}} or induce the {{consolidation}} of rural schools through legislation is common across the United States. Whereas consolidation was once chiefly about school improvement, today {{it is more likely}} to be about fiscal savings. Legislative battles have produced many lessons for rural school advocates which are discussed here. Consolidation is also on the agenda of many of the school reform movements at work in the United States, many of which see rural schools as <b>too</b> <b>numerous,</b> <b>too</b> attached <b>to</b> the communities they serve, and too democratically managed to reform from without. As reformers grapple with the resistance to reform in many rural community schools, they assume the haughty and arrogant style of the fading English aristocracy that Oscar Wilde lampooned in The Importance of Being Earnest. The essay closes with a caricature of the 2 ̆ 2 education reform aristocracy 2 ̆ 2 attributing to it some of the sentiments expressed by Wilde 2 ̆ 7 s pompous characters...|$|R
25|$|Mr. T.M. Carnegie's {{abilities}} were <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> {{and complex}} <b>to</b> {{be summed up}} in a sentence. He was a man of sterling integrity; and it was a common saying in Pittsburg that his word was better than some men's bond. He had remarkable judgment; and his opinion on commercial questions was valued above that of much older and more experienced men. Quick and keen in his perceptions, cautious but progressive in his ideas, faithful to his engagements, and just in all his dealings, he gave to his company that which corporations are habitually lacking, namely, a conscience.|$|R
25|$|The Tramways Committee met {{nearly every}} two weeks and the minutes record a {{constant}} stream of accidents and claims on the committee for damages <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> <b>to</b> list here. There are complaints by shopkeepers against tramcar drivers who let their horses and cars stand outside the shop. There are records of payments to tramcar drivers who acted bravely in restraining horses which were startled and bolted. Despite the imminent introduction of electric cars, the horse tram rails still required maintenance, and the minute book records that the track outside the Mechanics Institute was replaced at the end of 1897.|$|E
25|$|Though <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> <b>to</b> list, {{the city}} has a {{surprising}} number of architecturally significant late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century buildings and skyscrapers. Daniel Burnham, Louis Kamper, and the Smith Hinchman & Grylls firm are among the architects who designed some of the city's other important skyscrapers {{at the turn of the}} century which endure today. Burnham's three remaining Detroit skyscraper designs are the Neo-Classical styled Chrysler House (1912) — renovated in 2002, and the Neo-Renaissance Whitney (1915) and Ford (1909) buildings. Among their early projects Smith Hinchman & Grylls designed the Neo-Gothic R.H. Fyfe Building (1919) at Woodward and Adams, now a residential high-rise.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{of great}} {{interest}} is also a history written by Isidore of Seville. He used Hydatius’s accounts, together with the Chronicle of John of Biclaro, to form an abridged history of the Suevi in Hispania. The controversy around Isidorus’s historiography is centered on his omissions and additions, which many historians and scholars consider <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> <b>to</b> all be simply mistakes. Throughout Isidore’s History of the Kings of the Goths, Vandals, and Sueves certain details from Hydatius are altered. Many scholars attribute these changes {{to the fact that}} Isidore may have had sources other than Hydatius at his disposal.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{national}} parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs), the heritage coast designation is non-statutory, and designations can only be made with the agreement of local authorities and landowners. However, the majority of heritage coast falls within statutorily designated landscapes such as {{national parks}}, AONBs and the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. These coincident designations {{are listed in the}} fourth column of the tables below. Designations for nature conservation (as opposed to landscape, e.g. SSSI, Special Area of Conservation and Special Protection Area) of parts of Heritage Coasts are <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> and complex <b>to</b> easily list here.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few short}} words the good Abbot gave us the very points that we wished to know. But all that he said only made our task more formidable. The walls of the Abbey were forty feet high. The lower windows were barricaded, and the whole {{building}} loopholed for musketry fire. The gang preserved military discipline, and their sentries were <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> for us <b>to</b> hope to take them by surprise. It was more than ever evident that a battalion of grenadiers {{and a couple of}} breaching pieces were what was needed. I raised my eyebrows, and the Bart began to whistle.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{traces the}} origins and {{evolution}} of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) over two decades of continuous operation. The technology has been continuously improved from hundreds of milliseconds in the rowdy Internet of the early 1980 s to tens of nanoseconds in the Internet of the new century. It includes a blend of history lessons, technology milestones and series of experiments that shape, define and record {{the early history of}} the Internet and NTP. This narrative is decidedly personal, since the job description for an Internet timekeeper is highly individualized and invites very few applicants. There is no attempt here to present a comprehensive tutorial, only a almanac of personal observations, eclectic minutiae and fireside chat. Many souls have contributed to the technology, some of which are individually acknowledged in this paper, the rest <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> left <b>to</b> write their own memoirs...|$|R
25|$|When the Spanish War Memorial Committee's Committee on Estimates and Designs {{considered}} {{the nature of}} the memorial, it quickly realized that the number of dead was <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> <b>to</b> list their names on a tablet. A memorial book listing the names of the dead was more appropriate, so the Spanish War Memorial Committee established a second subcommittee, the Record Book Committee, to produce this volume. Esther Gill Jackson of Maryland was appointed chair of this subcommittee. Rosa Wright Smith of Washington, D.C., the society's Assistant National Secretary, was assigned to aid her. Jackson sent hundreds of letters to state militia commanders, requesting complete lists of the name, rank, and home towns of those in state militia and volunteer regiments who died in the war. Complete lists of U.S. Army and U.S. Navy dead were obtained from General Henry Clarke Corbin, Adjutant General of the Army, and Rear Admiral Presley Marion Rixey, Surgeon General of the Navy.|$|E
25|$|The {{damage was}} {{greatest}} both near, and well {{north of the}} surface faulting, {{as well as at}} the foot of the mountains. The hospital buildings, the freeway overpasses, and the Sylmar Juvenile Hall facility were situated on coarse alluvium that overlaid thousands of feet of loosely consolidated sedimentary material. Underground water, sewer, and gas systems did not fare well in the city of San Fernando where the breaks were <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> <b>to</b> count, and some sections were so badly damaged that they were abandoned. Ground displacement damaged sidewalks and roadways, with cracks in the more rigid asphalt and concrete often exceeding the width of the shift in the underlying soil. Accentuated damage near alluvium had been documented previously during the investigation of the effects of the 1969 Santa Rosa earthquakes. A band of similarly intense damage further away near Ventura Boulevard at the southern end of the valley was also identified as having been related to soil type.|$|E
25|$|The dhole {{only rarely}} takes {{domestic}} livestock. Certain people, {{such as the}} Kurumbas and some Mon Khmer-speaking tribes will appropriate dhole kills; some Indian villagers welcome the dhole because of this appropriation of dhole kills. Dholes were persecuted throughout India for bounties until they were given protection by the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. Methods used for dhole hunting included poisoning, snaring, shooting and clubbing at den sites. Native Indian people killed dholes primarily to protect livestock, while British sporthunters during the British Raj did so under the conviction that dholes were responsible for drops in game populations. Persecution of dholes still occurs {{with varying degrees of}} intensity according to region. Bounties paid for dholes used to be 25 rupees, though this was reduced to 20 in 1926 after the number of presented dhole carcasses became <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> <b>to</b> maintain the established reward. In Indochina, dholes suffer heavily from nonselective hunting techniques such as snaring.|$|E
50|$|The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh was {{established}} in 1505, known then as the Barber Surgeons of Edinburgh. The Museum at Surgeons Hall, Edinburgh dates from 1699 when the Incorporation of Edinburgh Surgeons announced that they were making a collection of ‘natural and artificial curiosities’. and advertised for these in {{the first edition of}} a local paper, the Edinburgh Gazette. Daniel Defoe, an early visitor in 1726, wrote in his Tour thro' the whole Island of Great Britain that the 'chamber of rarities' contained many curious things <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> for him <b>to</b> describe. Much of this early collection was given to the University of Edinburgh in the 1760s.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{model of}} a robot {{may not be able}} to {{consider}} all the physical phenomena influencing the manipulator performances since they are <b>too</b> <b>numerous</b> and/or difficult <b>to</b> measure: this is model discrepancy. For a highly-accurate active space telescope, an important source of inaccuracy was measured using photogrammetry: the deformation of its mobile platform. This deformation cannot be directly measured in space and needs to be properly modeled in order to enable the telescope calibration with the available measurements. Two incremental models are proposed and the parameter observability is discussed. After experimental calibration, a micrometer accuracy can be reached. The influence of model discrepancy on the experimental parameter identification is finally discussed...|$|R
2500|$|In model theory, a {{complete}} theory [...] is called stable {{if it does}} not have too many types. One goal of classification theory is to divide all complete theories into those whose models can be classified and those whose models are too complicated to classify, and to classify all models in the cases where this can be done. Roughly speaking, if a theory is not stable then its models are <b>too</b> complicated and <b>numerous</b> <b>to</b> classify, while if a theory is stable there might be some hope of classifying its models, especially if the theory is superstable or totally transcendental.|$|R
