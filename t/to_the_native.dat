In various tribal {{languages}} (Plateau Penutian, Chinookan, Salishan), Pahto means high up, very high, standing up, or high sloping mountain. The Klickitat name is of Klickitat origin and {{comes from the}} Chinookan for beyond.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> {{conditions}} {{of where it}} developed, the Boreray is very well suited to conservation grazing, which is grazing that uses livestock to improve biodiversity and achieve nature conservation in a given area. However, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust believe {{that this could be}} further capitalised on if the breed is developed further.|$|E
5|$|Floating point {{numbers are}} also {{stored in a}} platform-specific range. They can be {{specified}} using floating point notation, or two forms of scientific notation. PHP has a native Boolean type that is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> Boolean types in Java and C++. Using the Boolean type conversion rules, non-zero values are interpreted as true and zero as false, as in Perl and C++.|$|E

50|$|The {{one issue}} Laval never relented with, however, was {{the trade of}} alcohol <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives.</b> Once he was {{appointed}} bishop, he revisited his original cause. In 1675, Laval, despite Governor Frontenac’s resistance on <b>the</b> matter, proceeded <b>to</b> excommunicate all who sold alcohol <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives.</b> On 24 May 1679 Laval succeeded in obtaining a royal decree banning the trade.|$|R

5|$|A Jack Russell named Bothy {{made history}} in 1982 {{as part of}} the Transglobe Expedition. Owned by explorers Ranulph and Ginny Fiennes, he became the first dog to travel to both the north and south poles. This feat is {{unlikely}} to be repeated, as all dogs have been banned from Antarctica by the Antarctic Treaty nations since 1994, due to fears that they could transmit diseases <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> seal population. Ranulph Fiennes and Charles Burton actually made the trip to the north pole by powered sledges before signalling to the base camp that they had arrived. To celebrate their achievement, a plane was sent out to take the two men champagne, along with Bothy.|$|E

5|$|Allah jang Palsoe was {{the first}} stage play by the {{journalist}} Kwee Tek Hoay. Born to an ethnic Chinese textile merchant and his wife, Kwee was raised in Chinese culture and schools that focused on modernity. By the time he wrote the drama, Kwee Tek Hoay was an active proponent of Buddhist theology. However, he also wrote extensively on themes relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> population of the archipelago and was a keen social observer. He read extensively in Dutch, English, and Malay, and drew on these readings after becoming a writer.|$|E
5|$|Fauna is sparse on {{the island}} due to a {{combination}} of a lack of vegetation and the consequences of phosphates mining. Many indigenous birds have disappeared or become rare owing to destruction of their habitat. There are about 60recorded vascular plant species native to the island, none of which are endemic. Coconut farming, mining, and introduced species have caused serious disturbance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> vegetation.|$|E

60|$|All these {{precautions}} {{with respect}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> were defeated by one unwary provision. It was permitted that the Indians might be compelled <b>to</b> work in <b>the</b> mines, {{and in other}} employments; but this was limited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> royal service. They were to be engaged as hired laborers, and punctually paid. This provision led to great abuses and oppressions, and was ultimately as fatal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> as {{could have been the}} most absolute slavery.|$|R

5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Roberts sat on {{an interim}} committee dealing with hospice and palliative care issues, and carried legislation originating from that committee during the 2010 session, including two bills that clarified policies surrounding end-of-life care and advance directives. Other legislation that Roberts carried in 2010 included {{a bill to}} allow voluntary income tax contributions to support 2-1-1 services, and she fought against cuts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> American tuition waiver program at Fort Lewis College. Roberts {{was one of only}} three Republican House members to vote in support of Colorado's 2010 budget, after successfully sponsoring an amendment that removed restrictions on Fort Lewis College's ability to set its own out-of-state tuition rates.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{departure}} of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been {{the southern part of the}} Celtic kingdom of Elmet, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of Mercia. Gradually, Anglian settlers pushed west from the kingdom of Deira. The Britons of Elmet delayed this English expansion into the early part of the 7th century. An enduring Celtic presence within this area is evidenced by the settlements called Wales and Waleswood close to Sheffield—the word Wales derives from the Germanic word Walha, and was originally used by the Anglo-Saxons to refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> Britons.|$|E
5|$|He had {{intended}} {{to go to the}} bar, but in the October term of 1802 he chanced to hear Charles Simeon speaking of the good done in India by a single missionary, William Carey, and some time afterwards he read the life of David Brainerd, a missionary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Native</b> Americans. He resolved, accordingly, to become a missionary himself. On 22 October 1803, he was ordained deacon at Ely, and afterwards priest, and served as Simeon's curate at the Church of Holy Trinity, taking charge of the neighbouring parish of Lolworth.|$|E
2500|$|After the conquest, the Spanish crown {{focused on}} the Catholic {{indoctrination}} of <b>the</b> <b>natives.</b> Human settlements founded by royal missionaries in the New World were called [...] "Indian doctrines" [...] or simply [...] "doctrines". Originally, friars had only temporary missions: teach <b>the</b> Catholic faith <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives,</b> and then transfer <b>the</b> settlements <b>to</b> secular parishes, just like the ones that existed in Spain at the time; the friars were supposed to teach Spanish and Catholicism <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>natives.</b> And when <b>the</b> <b>natives</b> were ready, they could start living in parishes and contribute with mandatory tithing, just like the people in Spain.|$|R

5|$|Invasive plants include {{fountain}} grass, tamarisk, Malta starthistle, {{and many}} others, but {{by far the}} most severe threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> ecosystem is buffelgrass. This drought-tolerant plant, native to parts of Africa and Asia, was imported to the United States in the 1930s and planted near Tucson and elsewhere to create cattle forage and to control erosion. First detected in the park in 1989, it has dispersed widely in both districts. Competing with other plants for sustenance, buffelgrass fills the empty spaces normally found between native desert plants and creates a significant fire hazard. The noxious weed, considered impossible to completely eliminate, is managed in some areas of the park and in Tucson residential zones by hand-pulling and, during periods of wet weather, application of glyphosate-based herbicides.|$|E
5|$|Numbered Treaties {{were signed}} {{in the late}} 19th century with the chiefs of various First Nations that lived in the area. These {{treaties}} made specific promises of land for every family. As a result, a reserve system was established {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Federal Government. The prescribed amount of land promised <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> peoples was not always given; this led aboriginal groups to assert rights to the land through aboriginal land claims, many of which are still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{were known}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>native</b> people of Sumatra and Borneo for millennia.
