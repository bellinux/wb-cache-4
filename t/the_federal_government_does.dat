5|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{the planning and}} construction of L'Enfant Plaza (immediately {{to the west of}} the site) delayed construction of any buildings on the block until the late 1960s. In 1963, the RLA purchased the land from the Westminster Memorial Church, Fifth Baptist Church, and homeowners. The United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare wished to purchase the site for its new headquarters, but the RLA declined to sell the property. (<b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not pay taxes on land and structures it owns, and the RLA wanted a private owner who would add to the tax base.) The RLA attempted to sell the land on January 29, 1965, but there were no buyers.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not {{regularly}} measure or estimate travel speeds. One {{study reported}} in a transportation engineering journal offered historical perspective on the increase in travel speeds over a decade, as shown below.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the state}} of Montana is not engaged in a full inter se {{adjudication}} of water rights, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not have to relinquish its water rights in Montana under the McCarran Act. The MWUA established the Montana Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission to negotiate a series of compacts with federal agencies and Native American tribes to essentially adjudicate federal claims.|$|E

25|$|The Swiss National Bank (SNB) {{serves as}} the country's central bank. Founded by the Federal Act on the Swiss National Bank (16 January 1906), it began {{conducting}} business on 20 June 1907. Its shares are publicly traded, and are held by the cantons, cantonal banks, and individual investors; <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not hold any shares. Although a central bank often has regulatory authority over the country's banking system, the SNB does not; regulation is solely {{the role of the}} Federal Banking Commission.|$|E
25|$|The first {{civil unions}} in the United States were {{offered by the}} state of Vermont in 2000. <b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not {{recognize}} these unions. By the end of 2006, Connecticut and New Jersey had also enacted civil union laws; New Hampshire followed in 2007. Furthermore, California's domestic partnership law had been expanded {{to the point that it}} became practically a civil union law, as well. The same might be said for domestic partnership in the District of Columbia, domestic partnership in Washington, and domestic partnership in Oregon.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the Florida Department of Education {{announced}} that Brevard's graduation rate {{was the highest}} in the state at 92.1%. However, there is a major discrepancy between the way the state measures student graduation (tracks each student) and the way <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> (quantity entering, quantity graduating). So the figure by national standards is much lower. Using federal guidelines, the graduation rate for the class of 2005, was 69.3%, {{the highest in the}} state, but below the national average of 70.6%. The school district was first or second in the state for graduation rates from 2001 through 2009.|$|E
50|$|One {{argument}} against retrocession was that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> in fact use Alexandria: {{as a military}} outpost, signal corps site, and cemetery.|$|R

25|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that on more than one occasion, the federal {{government}} has threatened to withhold highway funds from states which did not pass certain articles of legislation. Any state which lost highway funding for any extended period would face financial impoverishment, infrastructure collapse or both. Although the first such action (the enactment of a national speed limit) was directly related to highways and done {{in the face of a}} fuel shortage, most subsequent actions have had little or nothing to do with highways and have not been done in the face of any compelling national crisis. An example of this would be the federally mandated drinking age of 21, upheld in South Dakota v. Dole. Critics of such actions feel that when <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> this they upset the traditional balance between the states and the federal government.|$|E
25|$|Freedom of religion, {{despite being}} {{guaranteed}} in the constitution, faces many restrictions in Malaysia. Legally, a Malay in Malaysia {{must be a}} Muslim. Non-Malays are more free to shift between religions. Attempts by Muslims to convert to other religions are punished by state governments, with punishments ranging from fines to imprisonment. <b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not intervene in legal disputes over conversion, leaving it to the courts. The secular courts of Malaysia have ruled {{they do not have}} the authority to decide these cases, referring them to the Syariah courts. These Islamic courts have unanimously ruled that all ethnic Malays must remain Muslims. Even non-Malays who have converted to Islam are not allowed to leave Islam, and children born to Muslim parents are considered to be Muslims. A non-Muslim who wishes to marry a Muslim must first convert to Islam.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not {{guarantee}} universal healthcare to all its citizens, but publicly funded healthcare programs help {{to provide for}} the elderly, disabled, the poor, and children. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act or EMTALA also ensures public access to emergency services. The EMTALA law forces emergency healthcare providers to stabilize an emergency health crisis and cannot withhold treatment for lack of evidence of insurance coverage or other evidence of the ability to pay. EMTALA does not absolve the person receiving emergency care of the obligation to meet the cost of emergency healthcare not paid for at the time and it is still within the right of the hospital to pursue any debtor for the cost of emergency care provided. In Canada, emergency room treatment for legal Canadian residents is not charged to the patient at time of service but is met by the government.|$|E
50|$|Initially, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> {{not have}} {{support from the}} provincial governments. Only Ontario and New Brunswick {{supported}} the plan.

50|$|Justice John Marshall Harlan II dissented in Roth, {{involving}} a federal statute, but concurred in Alberts, {{involving a}} state law, {{on the grounds}} that while states had broad power to prosecute obscenity, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not.|$|R
25|$|The federal {{government}} asked on April 6, 1879, {{that the jury}} verdict be set aside {{on the basis of}} the Supreme Court's ruling in Carr v. United States, 98 U.S. 433, (a decision handed down on March 3, after the jury's verdict had been reached). Carr v. United States involved a case where the city of San Francisco, California, transferred title to property within the city to the {{federal government}} even though a private citizen claimed title to the land. The Supreme Court reaffirmed in Carr that the federal government cannot be sued without its consent, that a suit against an officer or agent of <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not bind the government itself, and that courts do not have jurisdiction over title suits against the federal government's officers and agents. Only when property has been transferred by the courts does a private citizen establish a right to establish or reclaim rights to title. But the circuit court in Lee held that much of the decision in Carr was dicta, and reaffirmed the jury decision.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} states without {{wetlands}} laws on their books still have other state environmental laws dealing with water quality or natural resources, and they may already provide substantial authority to regulate wetlands. However, a comprehensive picture of states' ability to protect wetlands, under various possible authorities, is difficult to draw together. To {{fill in the gap}} left by removal of some federal regulatory jurisdiction, states could adopt more comprehensive wetlands regulatory statutes or wetland amendments to state pollution control statutes (possibly including independent water quality certification programs) and rules. The latter, for example, could integrate wetlands, water quality, and watershed management. States do not have the constitutional constraints that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> in enacting legislation (whether a legislative action exceeds Congress' power under the Commerce Clause). Also, CWA section 404(t) expressly provides that the existence of section 404 does not preempt state law governing the discharge of dredged or fill material. However, whether states will take steps to expand wetlands protection in response to the Court's decision raises difficult political and resource questions. It is quite likely that, among states, the SWANCC decision pleases some states and is opposed by others.|$|E
500|$|Robert L. Schulz and his We the People Foundation {{take the}} {{positions}} {{that the government}} [...] "is clearly prohibited from doing what it is doing – taxing the salaries, wages and compensation of the {{working men and women}} of this country and forcing the business entities that utilize the labor of ordinary American citizens to withhold and turn over to the IRS a part of the earnings of those workers" [...] and [...] "that <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>DOES</b> NOT possess ANY legal authority statutory or Constitutional to tax the wages or salaries of American workers." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{grassroots}} {{generation of}} survivor registries led {{many people to}} wonder why <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> not have such a system already in place.

2500|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> {{not have}} {{specific}} statutory law for establishing partnerships, {{it has an}} extensive statutory and regulatory scheme for the taxation of partnerships, {{set forth in the}} Internal Revenue Code and Code of Federal Regulations. [...] The IRC is Title 26 of the United States Code wherein Subchapter K of Chapter 1 creates tax consequences based upon partnership operations that effectively serve as a federal statutory scheme that governs many aspects of partnerships.|$|E
2500|$|In United States {{constitutional}} law, {{police power}} is {{the capacity of the}} states to regulate behavior and enforce order within their territory for the betterment of the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of their inhabitants. [...] Under the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the powers not delegated to the Federal Government are reserved to the states or to the people. This implies that <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Government</b> <b>does</b> not possess all possible powers, because most of these are reserved to the State governments, and others are reserved to the people.|$|E
2500|$|Nickles said, [...] "If {{some state}} wishes to {{recognize}} same-sex marriage, {{they can do}} so".

Patricia Schroeder said, [...] "You can't amend the Constitution with a statute. Everybody knows that. This is just stirring the political waters and seeing what hate you can unleash." [...] Barr countered that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution grants Congress power to determine [...] "the effect" [...] of the obligation of each state to grant [...] "full faith and credit" [...] to other states' acts.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is unclear}} how safe the bridge {{actually}} is, or what its current lifespan is projected to be. According to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not maintain an inventory of rail bridges or their condition. Nor {{is the federal government}} responsible for railroad bridge safety: [...] "Responsibility for railroad bridge safety rests with the owner of the track carried by the structure. The owner ensures the bridge is capable of safely accommodating all rail traffic operated over the track and specifies the maximum weight the structure can support." [...] There is also no federal law or regulation which requires railroad bridge owners {{to ensure the safety of}} their bridges. Rather, it is FRA [...] "policy" [...] that they do so by following the recommendations contained in the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance-of-Way Association's Manual for Railway Engineering and by inspecting bridges annually using trained, experienced inspectors.|$|E

Not one day passes that some evidence does not come to hand of Yankee fraud and mendacity.

2500|$|No {{uniform system}} for {{regulation}} of assisted reproductive technologies, including genetic testing, {{exists in the}} United States. The practice and regulation of PGD most often falls under state laws or professional guidelines as <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> not have direct jurisdiction over the practice of medicine. To date, no state has implemented laws directly pertaining to PGD, therefore leaving researchers and clinicians to abide to guidelines set by the professional associations. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that all clinics providing IVF must report pregnancy success rates annually to the federal government, but reporting of PGD use and outcomes is not required. Professional organizations, such as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), have provided limited guidance on the ethical uses of PGD. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) states that, [...] "PGD {{should be regarded as}} an established technique with specific and expanding applications for standard clinical practice." [...] They also state, [...] "While the use of PGD for the purpose of preventing sex-linked diseases is ethical, the use of PGD solely for sex selection is discouraged." ...|$|E
