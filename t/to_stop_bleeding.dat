25|$|An {{embolism}} {{is usually}} a pathological event, i.e., accompanying illness or injury. Sometimes it is created intentionally for a therapeutic reason, such as <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>bleeding</b> or to kill a cancerous tumor by stopping its blood supply. Such therapy is called embolization.|$|E
25|$|Cryobiology {{history can}} be traced back to antiquity. As early as in 2500 BC, low {{temperatures}} were used in Egypt in medicine. The use of cold was recommended by Hippocrates <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>bleeding</b> and swelling. With the emergence of modern science, Robert Boyle studied the effects of low temperatures on animals.|$|E

25|$|Oxytocin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Pitocin among others, is a {{medication}} made from the peptide oxytocin. As a medication, {{it is used to}} cause contraction of the uterus in order to start labor, increase the speed of labor, and <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>bleeding</b> following delivery. For this purpose, it is given by injection either into a muscle or into a vein.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin, in addition, evokes endothelial {{nitric oxide}} synthase {{activation}} and stimulates, through a 5-HT1B receptor-mediated mechanism, the phosphorylation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in bovine aortic endothelial cell cultures. In blood, serotonin is collected from plasma by platelets, which store it. It is thus active wherever platelets bind in damaged tissue, as a vasoconstrictor <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>bleeding,</b> and also as a fibrocyte mitotic (growth factor), to aid healing.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} widely {{investigated}} material in this category, magnesium was originally investigated as a potential biomaterial in 1878 when it was used by physician Edward C. Huse in wire form as a ligature <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>bleeding.</b> Development continued into the 1920s, after which Mg-based biomaterials fell out of general investigation due to their poor performance (likely due to impurities in the alloys drastically increasing corrosion). It {{was not until the}} late 1990s that interest started to pick up again, spurred by the availability of ultra-high purity Mg, which significantly increases its longevity inside the body.|$|E

500|$|During Victoria's {{lifetime}} and {{after her death}} in 1901, there have been rumours that Conroy or someone else, and not the Duke of Kent, was her biological father. Historians have continued to debate the accuracy and validity of these claims. In his 2003 work The Victorians, biographer A. N. Wilson suggests that Victoria was not actually descended from George III because several of her descendants had haemophilia, which was unknown among her recognised ancestors. Haemophilia is a genetic disease that [...] impairs the body's ability to control blood clotting, which is used <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>bleeding</b> when a blood vessel is broken; it is carried in the female line but the symptoms manifest mostly in males. Wilson proposes that the Duchess of Kent took a lover (not necessarily Conroy) {{to ensure that a}} Coburg would sit on the British throne.|$|E
500|$|The {{player can}} move with weapons drawn and use {{automatic}} targeting functions. Enemies can knock Regina's weapon {{out of her}} hand, at which point she'll have to retrieve it. Sometimes [...] "DANGER" [...] may flash on the screen in perilous situations, {{at which point the}} player should push all the controller buttons as rapidly as possible to survive. If Regina becomes injured, she will hold her arm or struggle to walk. Med Paks can be used to heal Regina's health. Sometimes a trail of blood may appear, indicating that Regina is bleeding and will continue to lose health. Hemostats can be used <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>bleeding</b> injuries. Two types of medical supplies are available in the game: Med Paks, which heals player health, and Hemostats, which stop bleeding injuries. If Regina dies, the player may continue from the room she died in. After five [...] "Continues" [...] are exhausted, the player must continue from their last save point.|$|E
2500|$|Epistaxis, or nosebleed, is {{a special}} case, where almost all first aid {{providers}} train the use of pressure points. [...] The appropriate point here is on the soft fleshy part of the nose, which should constrict the capillaries sufficiently <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>bleeding,</b> although obviously it does not stop bleeding from the nasopharynx or tear ducts.|$|E
5000|$|Choice of {{treatment}} is largely {{dictated by the}} clinical situation. A ruptured interstitial pregnancy is a medical emergency that requires an immediate surgical intervention either by laparoscopy or laparotomy <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the <b>bleeding</b> and remove the pregnancy.|$|R

2500|$|Platelets, {{also called}} thrombocytes ( [...] + , [...] "blood clot cell"), are a {{component}} of blood whose function (along with the coagulation factors) is <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>bleeding</b> by clumping and clotting blood vessel injuries. Platelets have no cell nucleus: they are fragments of cytoplasm that are derived from the megakaryocytes of the bone marrow, and then enter the circulation. These unactivated platelets are biconvex discoid (lens-shaped) structures, [...] 2–3µm in greatest diameter. Platelets are found only in mammals, whereas in other animals (e.g. birds, amphibians) thrombocytes circulate as intact mononuclear cells.|$|E
2500|$|After World War II and the Second Sino-Japanese War {{respectively}} in 1945, {{she moved}} to Keio University in Shinanomachi in Tokyo. As resources were scarce, {{she and her husband}} Shosuke Okamoto changed to research on blood: [...] "If there was not enough we could simply use our own". They hoped to find a treatment for post-partum haemorrhage, a potent drug <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>bleeding</b> after childbirth. They began by studying epsilon-amino-caproic acid (EACA). They then studied a related chemical, 1-(aminomethyl)-cyclohexane-4-carboxylic acid (AMCHA), also known as tranexamic acid. The Okamotos found it was 27 times as powerful and thus a promising hemostatic agent and published their findings in the Keio Journal of Medicine in 1962.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{specialized}} training {{began in}} the mid-15th century, when certain samurai families started to focus on covert warfare, including espionage and assassination. Like the samurai, ninja were born into the profession, where traditions were kept in, and passed down through the family. According to Turnbull, the ninja was trained from childhood, as was also common in samurai families. Outside the expected martial art disciplines, a youth studied survival and scouting techniques, {{as well as information}} regarding poisons and explosives. Physical training was also important, which involved long distance runs, climbing, stealth methods of walking and swimming. A certain degree of knowledge regarding common professions was also required if one was expected to take their form in disguise. Some evidence of medical training can be derived from one account, where an Iga ninja provided first-aid to Ii Naomasa, who was injured by gunfire in the Battle of Sekigahara. Here the ninja reportedly gave Naomasa a [...] "black medicine" [...] meant <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>bleeding.</b>|$|E
50|$|One of King's {{most memorable}} moments {{occurred}} while performing his cut-and-restored rope routine. King {{has said that}} one of his biggest pet peeves is that some magicians use dull scissors, and he makes it a point to keep his scissors razor sharp. While performing the routine, he accidentally severed the tip of his thumb. He quickly tried <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the <b>bleeding</b> by wrapping his thumb in tape, but the injury was too severe. He asked the audience if there was a nurse present, and a nurse stepped forward. She managed <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the <b>bleeding.</b> King continued with his show and finished his second show later that evening before going to the hospital to have his injury treated.|$|R
50|$|Treatment {{depends on}} the cause. In cases where {{malignancy}} is ruled out, hormone supplementation or the therapeutic use of hormonal contraception is usually recommended to induce bleeding on a regular schedule. Selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) are sometimes used <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> uterine <b>bleeding.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On {{the show}} Dual Survival, Canterbury {{demonstrated}} various survival skills, {{such as how}} to cauterize an injury using gunpowder and fire. He intentionally sliced open his own arm and then had his co-host, Cody Lundin, use this technique <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the <b>bleeding.</b>|$|R
2500|$|A {{dressing}} can {{be placed}} over wounds to keep them clean and to facilitate healing, and antibiotics {{may be used in}} cases where infection is likely. People with contaminated wounds who have not been immunized against tetanus within five years may be given a tetanus vaccination. Lacerations may require stitches <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>bleeding</b> and facilitate wound healing with as little scarring as possible. Although it is not common for bleeding from the maxillofacial region to be profuse enough to be life-threatening, it is still necessary to control such bleeding. [...] Severe bleeding occurs as the result of facial trauma in 1–11% of patients, and the origin of this bleeding can be difficult to locate. Nasal packing can be used to control nose bleeds and hematomas that may form on the septum between the nostrils. [...] Such hematomas need to be drained. [...] Mild nasal fractures need nothing more than ice and pain killers, while breaks with severe deformities or associated lacerations may need further treatment, such as moving the bones back into alignment and antibiotic treatment.|$|E
2500|$|All {{occupants}} of the ground floor were seriously injured. In the first-floor corridor, some occupants decided to {{lie down on the}} ground to show that they offered no resistance. Nonetheless, police beat them and kicked them when they arrived. Soon, there were police officers on all four floors of the building, kicking and battering prone occupants. In one corridor, police ordered a group of young men and women to kneel, so that they could batter them around the head and shoulders more easily. Here, Daniel Albrecht, a 21-year-old cello student from Berlin, had his head beaten so badly that he needed surgery <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>bleeding</b> in his brain. The police also used humiliation to cow the {{occupants of}} the school. An officer who stood spread-legged in front of a kneeling and injured woman, grabbed his groin and thrust it into her face. Another who paused amid the beatings and took a knife to cut off hair from his victims, including Nicola Doherty; the constant shouting of insults; the officer who asked a group if they were OK and who reacted to the one who said [...] "No" [...] by handing out an extra beating.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not {{our fault}} that we are so late. Our master's {{messenger}} was attacked, near Nevers, and was left for dead on the road. The letter he bore, and his purse, were taken from him. The night air caused his wounds <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>bleeding,</b> and he managed to crawl to Moulins. Having no money, {{he was unable to}} hire a horse, and indeed could not have sat one. He went to an inn frequented by market people, and there succeeded in convincing an honest peasant, who had come in with a cart of faggots, that his story was a true one, and promised him large pay on his arrival at la Vallee.|$|E
5000|$|A handkerchief, {{also called}} a bloodrag, is {{carried in the}} singlet. In the event of bleeding, the wrestler will remove the cloth from his singlet and attempt <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the <b>bleeding</b> or clean up any bodily fluids that may have gotten onto the mat.|$|R
50|$|Ferric subsulfate (also {{known as}} Monsell's Solution) {{is often used}} by Jewish burial {{societies}} (chevra kadisha) <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> post-mortem <b>bleeding.</b> Since Jewish burial does not allow any external skin adhesives such as bandages, tape, glue or resin, ferric subsulfate is an effective way <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> post-mortem <b>bleeding.</b> Most post-mortem bleeding stems from surgery, emergency room situations, autopsies or blood which may result when removing IV lines during Jewish burial preparation. A piece of cotton, or Q-tip, soaked with this solution is pressed against the open wound and held for a few seconds. This is usually enough time for the seal to take effect. For more severe cases, such as arterial lines, if the line is still inside, the solution can be inserted directly into the IV line.|$|R
50|$|The goal of {{treatment}} {{is to achieve}} a urine output of greater than 0.5 ml/kg/h, a central venous pressure of 8-12 mmHg and a mean arterial pressure of 65-95 mmHg. In trauma the goal is <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the <b>bleeding</b> which in many cases requires surgical interventions.|$|R
