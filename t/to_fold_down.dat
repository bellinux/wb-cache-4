25|$|The {{original}} design——provided for {{the island}} to retract flush with the deck during flight operations, but that {{was found to be}} too complicated. Another solution was considered where the two masts were <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> <b>down,</b> in lieu of the retractable island, to allow the carrier to pass under the Brooklyn Bridge. The larger center mast was to fold to the side and rest on the flight deck, and the smaller mast was to fold toward the stern.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, the Port Authority started {{planning}} {{on a project}} to allow larger container ships to use the Kill Van Kull. [...] The expansion of the Panama Canal, which allows the passage of larger ships coming from Asia to reach the East Coast, also made the bridge too low for these larger ships to pass under it {{on the way to}} and from Newark Bay. [...] Its clearance of between [...] above the Kill Van Kull depending on the tide meant that some contemporary ships, which could reach [...] above the waterline, had <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> antenna masts, take on ballast, or wait for low tide to pass through.|$|E
2500|$|Upon introduction, {{the model}} {{had only one}} trim level, which would later {{be known as the}} LX model trim; it was powered by the 2.0L straight-four B20B {{producing}} [...] at 5400rpm and [...] of torque at 4800rpm. Outer dimensions for this engine would be identical to the Integra's 1.8L engine, but internally the engine had a larger [...] bore to add the extra displacement needed to produce more torque. The engine utilized a one-piece cylinder sleeve construction unique from any other B-series engine. The chassis was a unibody design with a four-wheel double wishbone suspension. Inside, the rear seats were able <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> <b>down,</b> and a picnic table was stowed in the rear floor area. A common external trait that was visible with this generation was plastic cladding covering the front bumper, rear bumper, and fender wells. In most countries, CR-Vs had a chrome grille; however, in the United States, the grille was made out of the same black plastic as the bumpers. A major difference between the LX and EX trims was that the EX had anti-lock brakes and 15inch alloy wheels while the LX did not. Drivetrain options were front-wheel drive or Honda's Real Time AWD.|$|E

6000|$|Arctic Sleeping-bags.--Arctic {{travellers}} use coarse drugget bags, {{covered with}} brown holland {{to make them}} less pervious to the wind, and having a long flap at the upper end <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> over the face. I have already extracted passages from travellers' accounts relating to them, in speaking of [...] "Encamping on Snow," [...] p. 140, and another, when speaking of [...] "Snow-walls with Tenting for their Roofs," [...] p. 143.|$|E
60|$|This letter, {{written in}} Aurelia's best Italian hand, {{on a large}} sheet of paper, she brought with her the next evening. She was bidden <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> the exact place for the signature, which Mr. Belamour {{proceeded}} to affix, and she was then to carry it to the candles in the lobby, and there fold, seal, and address it to the Reverend Edward Godfrey, D.D., Canon of Windsor, Windsor. She found the A. Belamour very fairly written {{except that it was}} not horizontal, and she performed the rest of the task with ladylike dexterity, sealing it with a ring that had been supplied for the purpose. It did not, as she expected, bear the Belamour sheaf of arrows, but was a gem, representing a sleeping Cupid with folded wings, so beautiful that she asked leave to take another impression for Harriet, who collected seals, after the fashion of the day.|$|E
6000|$|This {{child of}} my {{invention}} was nearly six feet square, exclusive of two triangular flaps {{to serve as}} a pillow by night and as {{the top and bottom of}} the sack by day. I call it [...] "the sack," [...] but it was never a sack by more than courtesy: only a sort of long roll or sausage, green waterproof cart-cloth without and blue sheep's fur within. It was commodious as a valise, warm and dry for a bed. There was luxurious turning room for one; and at a pinch the thing might serve for two. I could bury myself in it up to the neck; for my head I trusted to a fur cap, with a hood <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> over my ears, and a band to pass under my nose like a respirator; and in case of heavy rain I proposed to make myself a little tent, or tentlet, with my waterproof coat, three stones, and a bent branch.|$|E
50|$|The Comet wagon would {{introduce}} a Dual-Action tailgate, able <b>to</b> both <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> or swing aside, an idea soon copied {{by all the}} major U.S. manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|After {{the killing}} of Alexander Litvinenko, {{probably}} authorized by the Kremlin, IFCL seems <b>to</b> have <b>folded</b> <b>down</b> its public activities. The foundation's web site has not been updated since 2006.|$|R
50|$|Also a Space Duster {{package was}} offered. This allowed the back bench seat <b>to</b> be <b>folded</b> <b>down,</b> {{allowing}} more space to carry cargo. There {{is also a}} security flap allowing private things to be stashed away from view of others.|$|R

50|$|Once {{the mine}} is scattered, {{the top is}} ejected, {{allowing}} the spring-loaded legs <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> <b>down.</b> Also four tripwires are launched away from the mine. After a short period the mine is armed, from that point on, any disturbance of the trip wires will trigger the mine, scattering fragments to a lethal radius of approximately 15 meters.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Cephalaria leucantha. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. They create a lower-surface, tentiform mine. The lower {{epidermis}} has strong folds, while the upper epidermis is vaulted. The mine contracts strongly, causing the leaf margins <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> and inwards. Last instar larvae also feed on the tissue of {{the roof of the}} mine. Pupation takes place within the mine.|$|E
5000|$|Yamhill. Sidewheeler. As of February 1867, this steamer made regular {{trips on}} the Tualatin River {{as far as}} Hillsboro, Oregon under Capt. Edward Kellogg, brother of Joseph Kellogg. [...] Yamhill had a hinged {{smokestack}} to allow it <b>to</b> be <b>folded</b> <b>down</b> on the deck to pass under bridges along the way.|$|R
50|$|On some {{versions}} the pad is on a hinge, {{in order}} <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> it <b>down</b> and facilitate storage, or simply take up less {{space in a}} room. In this case it is often called a drop leaf chair, and becomes a close cousin to the mechanical desk.|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to its radical exterior design, the interior {{design of the}} Ford Aerostar adopted many industry-standard features. For example, the seven-passenger Aerostar was configured with the 2-2-3 seating layout popularized in both Chrysler and General Motors minivans. Borrowing features from full-size conversion vans, XLT-trim versions were available with second-row bucket seats; another option allowed both rear bench seats <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> to make a bed; both rows of rear seats were removable.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the secret}} {{compartment}} bed is impossible <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> without the knob, René rings for monsieur Alfonse {{to come with}} his tools to try to open it. After listening through the wall with a stethoscope and having drilled a small air hole through it, monsieur Alfonse decides to put small dynamite charges at the hinges {{of the bed and}} blow them off. While René goes to ask Michelle for some dynamite, Edith decides to feed the trapped couple by pouring soup into the air hole.|$|E
50|$|The Stowboard design {{consists}} of a metal alloy middle platform, 110 mm front wheels mounted on a pivoting front truck, a plastic rear foot platform with 65mm conical rear wheels mounted on a straight axle. This design allows the Stowboard <b>to</b> be <b>folded</b> <b>down</b> from full length (31 inches) to an 11 x 8.5 x 4 inch block.|$|R
5000|$|Polespear: Pole spears, or hand spears, {{consist of}} a long shaft with point {{at one end and}} an elastic loop at the other for propulsion. They also come in a wide variety, from {{aluminum}} or titanium metal, to fiberglass or carbon fiber. Often they are screwed together from smaller pieces or able <b>to</b> be <b>folded</b> <b>down</b> for ease of transport. In 1951 Charlie Sturgill beat the competition (who were all using spearguns) with his own pole spear design.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} bolted-together anodized 6061-T6 aluminum and 4130 steel tubing, with its single-surface wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its 35 ft span wing {{is supported by a}} single tube-type kingpost and uses an [...] "A" [...] frame control bar. Buoyancy is provided by two Full Lotus inflatable floats. The wheels retract above the floats for water operations and in ground operations the nosewheel is fully steerable. The wing uses a unique hand crank mechanism <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> the wing in place on the frame and then <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> it <b>down</b> for storage or ground transportation.|$|R
50|$|As {{with its}} chassis, the 1978-1979 Bronco derives {{much of its}} body from the F-Series truck line, sharing the doors, front {{roofline}} and sheetmetal, and interior with the F-Series. Retaining the wagon body of its predecessor and adopting {{the configuration of the}} Blazer/Jimmy, the Bronco was fitted with a removable hardtop and folding rear seat. Similar to the Ford LTD Country Squire, the glass of the rear window rolled down into the tailgate (via a dash-mounted switch or from using the key on the outside), allowing the tailgate <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For 1966, {{the rear}} {{tailgate}} was updated, marking {{the debut of}} the two-way [...] "Magic Doorgate" [...] shared with all other Ford and Mercury station wagons; the design allowed the tailgate <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> as a tailgate as well as swing oututo the drivers' side as a door. For 1967, passenger capacity was expanded as sideways-facing third-row seats were added as an option. To increase ventilation for {{the rear of the}} vehicle, the Colony Park introduced fresh-air ventilation through channels integrated into the D-pillar, allowing ventilation if the rear window was retracted.|$|E
50|$|On October 26, 2016, Microsoft {{announced}} a 28-inch all-in-one desktop PC, the Surface Studio. The device {{claims to have}} the thinnest LCD ever made in an all-in-one PC. All its components, including the processor and a surround-sound system, are located in a compact base on which the screen is mounted upon via a flexible, four-point hinge. The design allows the screen <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> to a 20-degree angle for physical interaction with the user. It comes with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update preinstalled, but is optimized for the Windows 10 Creators Update released in April 2017.|$|E
50|$|A {{stowable}} {{rack mount}} monitor is 1U, 2U or 3U high and {{is mounted on}} rack slides allowing the display <b>to</b> be <b>folded</b> <b>down</b> and the unit slid into the rack for storage. The display is visible only when the display is {{pulled out of the}} rack and deployed. These units may include only a display or may be equipped with a keyboard creating a KVM (Keyboard Video Monitor). Most common are systems with a single LCD but there are systems providing two or three displays in a single rack mount system.|$|R
50|$|Accordingly, {{the style}} of the Multani shalwar is similar to the Sindhi kancha shalwar as both are {{derivatives}} of the pantaloon shalwar worn in Iraq The Multani shalwar is very wide, baggy, full and has folds like the Punjabi suthan. Further influence on the Multani shalwar came from Baloch migrants who arrived in Multan during the 15th century from Balochistan, Pakistan. However, the large Balochi shalwar was discarded by the migrants in favour of the local style. Nevertheless, a large amount of material is used around the waist <b>to</b> create <b>folds</b> <b>down</b> the legs.|$|R
5000|$|Henning {{tells the}} {{audience}} that the Origami Box is so named because it [...] "unfolds, like an Origami work of art." [...] He proceeds to unfold the box into a larger orange and black box. He further explains that the box holds just as much when it is <b>folded</b> <b>down</b> small as when it is opened up large. To demonstrate, a female assistant wearing a turquoise costume appears on stage and climbs into the box. Henning points out that she barely fits inside the larger box; and then proceeds <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> the box <b>down</b> into its original smaller size. As he does so, he recites a short poem: ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{standard}} {{dump truck}} is a truck chassis with a dump body mounted to the frame. The bed is {{raised by a}} vertical hydraulic ram mounted under {{the front of the}} body, or a horizontal hydraulic ram and lever arrangement between the frame rails, and the back of the bed is hinged {{at the back of the}} truck. The tailgate can be configured to swing up on top hinges (and sometimes also <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> on lower hinges) or it can be configured in the [...] "High Lift Tailgate" [...] format wherein pneumatic rams lift the gate open and up above the dump body.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a package}} 6 in longer than an Outback, the Baja {{featured}} a four-door passenger compartment {{along with a}} 41 in open bed and drop-down tailgate. A system marketed as the [...] "Switchback" [...] allowed the rear passenger seat <b>to</b> <b>fold</b> <b>down</b> and a small hatch from the open bed to fold inward, allowing an extended length of 75 in {{to the end of}} the open tailgate. A light in the instrument cluster signaled an [...] "open" [...] status for the Switchback. The design featured two stainless steel exposed buttresses behind the passenger compartment, marketed as Sports Bars, providing structural reinforcement for the open bed.|$|E

50|$|Ford Aerospace's entry {{was based}} around the Bofors 40 mm L/70 cannons, twin-mounted {{in the center}} of the turret in a fashion similar to the General Dynamics entry. The {{relatively}} large and boxy turret also mounted separate long-range search and short-range tracking radars on top. The radars were mounted on booms to give them a clear view of the sky, and both had the ability <b>to</b> be <b>folded</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> reduce the vehicle's height during travel. The tracking radar was a modified version of the Westinghouse AN/APG-66 from the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Like the GD entry, it also mounted a complete optical sighting and ranging system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sides of}} the [...] stand almost {{straight}} up, due to the wide top sewn onto the cap. The skirt that surrounds the cap {{is made in the}} same wool as the cap, and is double layered in the rear three quarters of the skirt, enabling it <b>to</b> be <b>folded</b> <b>down</b> over the ears. The skirt has a small dip in the front quarter with a divide secured by two small buttons {{in order to get the}} skirt around the bill. The small section in the front quarter was built shorter to show the insignia, and cover the wearer's chin or mouth, without disturbing breathing by covering the nose.|$|R
50|$|A hinge in {{the frame}} may allow the rear {{triangle}} and wheel <b>to</b> be <b>folded</b> <b>down</b> and flipped forward, under the main frame tube, as in the Bike Friday, Brompton Mezzo Folder, and Swift Folder. Such a flip hinge may be combined with a folding front fork, as in the Birdy. Swing and flip hinges may be combined on the same frame, as in the Brompton Mezzo Folder and Dahon, which use a folding steering column. Folding mechanisms typically involve latches and quick releases, which affect {{the speed of the}} fold/unfold. Bike Friday offers a model, the Tikit, featuring a cable-activated folding mechanism requiring no quick releases or latches, for increased folding speed.|$|R
