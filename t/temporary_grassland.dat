Land use patterns were studied based on agricultural and forestry data from the French Ministry of Agriculture collected in 1955 and 1988. In the Massif Central. France, water vole populations were monitored from 1985 to 1993 by using index methods. Outbreaks of water vote populations occurred in many dispersed epicentres and spread suddenly and widely over > 7500 km(2). At a regional scale, the fluctuation lasts six years on average with an outbreak period lasting from two to three years. Density variation patterns are positively correlated with the proportion of permanent grassland to agricultural land. A high risk of outbreak is linked to {{a high proportion of}} permanent grassland (over 90 %), whereas a low risk of outbreak is linked to a proportion of < 80 %. Conversely. density variation patterns are negatively correlated with the proportion of <b>temporary</b> <b>grassland</b> to agricultural land and with the proportion of forest to total land in the western (major) part of the study area. <b>Temporary</b> <b>grassland</b> thus appears to be a marginal habitat for water voles and extensive forests could act as a brake on outbreaks. The increase in the area of permanent grassland from 1955 to 1988 was apparently the major cause of chronic high densities of water voles.

A simulation study was performed using the model PASIM to extrapolate potential emissions from grassland/livestock systems under alternative climate/soil/plant/management regimes at 12 French sites. Fluxes of CO 2 associated with those of N 2 O indicate that both gases may be controlled by similar or concomitant environmental factors. In particular, CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes {{were higher in the}} <b>temporary</b> <b>grasslands,</b> where grass management (mowing, N fertilization) promotes increased plant respiration and soil organic matter turnover. In these systems, high CO 2 and N 2 O emissions were accompanied by absence of CH 4 emissions.

High CH 4, and low CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes were generally estimated with extensive permanent pastures.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the dynamics of}} soil N mineralization in the experimental intensive dairy farming system ‘De Marke’ on a dry sandy soil in the Netherlands. We hypothesized that knowledge {{of the effects of}} crop rotation on soil N mineralization and of the spatial and temporal variability of soil N mineralization in a farming system can be used to better synchronize N application with crop N requirements, and hence to increase the recovery of applied N and to reduce N losses. Soil N mineralization was recorded continuously in the soil layer 0 – 0. 30 m, from 1992 to 2005, using a sequential in situ coring technique on six observation plots, of which two were located in permanent grassland and four in crop rotations with a 3 year grassland phase and an arable phase of 3 or 5 years, dominated by maize. Average annual soil N mineralization was highest under permanent grassland: 381 kg ha- 1 and lowest under = 3 rd years arable crops: 184 kg ha- 1. In <b>temporary</b> <b>grassland,</b> soil N mineralization increased in the order: 1 st year, 2 nd year, 3 rd year grassland and in arable crops after grassland mineralization decreased in the order: 1 st year, 2 nd year, = 3 rd years. Total mineral N input, i. e. the sum of N mineralization and mineral N supply to soil, exceeded crop N requirements in 1 st year maize and was lower than the requirements in 1 st year <b>temporary</b> <b>grassland.</b> N mineralization in winter, outside the growing season, was 77 kg ha- 1 in maize and 60 kg ha- 1 in grassland. This points at the importance of a suitable catch crop to reduce the susceptibility to N leaching. Temporal and spatial variability of soil N mineralization was high and could not be related to known field conditions. This limits the extent to which N fertilization can be adjusted to soil N mineralization. Variability increased with the magnitude of soil N mineralization. Hence, situations with high soil N mineralization may be associated with high risks for N losses and to reduce these risks a strong build-up of soil organic N should be avoided. This might be achieved, for instance, by fermenting slurry before application on farmland to enhance the fraction mineral N in slurry at the expense of organic N...|$|E

Solitary bees were caught with colored pan traps in 15 margins of OSR fields and 35 margins of non-OSR fields.

40|$|Positive plant diversity-productivity {{relationships}} {{have been reported}} for experimental semi-natural grasslands (Cardinale et al. 2006; Hector et al. 1999; Tilman et al. 1996) as well as <b>temporary</b> agricultural <b>grasslands</b> (Frankow-Lindberg et al. 2009; Kirwan et al. 2007; Nyfeler et al. 2009; Picasso et al. 2008). Generally, these relationships are explained, on the one hand, by niche differentiation and facilitation (Hector et al. 2002; Tilman et al. 2002) and, on the other hand, by greater probability of including a highly productive plant species in high diversity plots (Huston 1997). Both explanations accept that diversity is significant because species differ in characteristics, such as root architecture, nutrient acquisition and water use efficiency, to name a few, resulting in composition and diversity being important for improved productivity and resource use (Naeem et al. 1994; Tilman et al. 2002). Plant diversity is generally low in <b>temporary</b> agricultural <b>grasslands</b> grown for ruminant fodder production. Grass in pure stands is common, but requires high nitrogen (N) inputs. In terms of N input, two-species grass-legume mixtures are more sustainable than grass in pure stands and consequently dominate low N input grasslands (Crews and Peoples 2004; Nyfeler et al. 2009; Nyfeler et al. 2011). In temperate grasslands, N is often the limiting factor for productivity (Whitehead 1995). Plant available soil N is generally concentrated in the upper soil layers, but may leach to deeper layers, especially in grasslands that include legumes (Scherer-Lorenzen et al. 2003) and under conditions with surplus precipitation (Thorup-Kristensen 2006). To improve soil N use efficiency in <b>temporary</b> <b>grasslands,</b> we propose the addition of deep-rooting plant species to a mixture of perennial ryegrass and white clover, which are the most widespread forage plant species in <b>temporary</b> <b>grasslands</b> in a temperate climate (Moore 2003). Perennial ryegrass and white clover possess relatively shallow root systems (Kutschera and Lichtenegger 1982; Kutschera and Lichtenegger 1992) with effective rooting depths of < 0. 7 m on a silt loamy site (Pollock and Mead 2008). Grassland species, such as lucerne and chicory, grow their tap-roots into deep soil layers and exploit soil nutrients and water in soil layers that the commonly grown shallow-rooting grassland species cannot reach (Braun et al. 2010; Skinner 2008). Chicory grown as a catch crop after barley reduced the inorganic soil N down to 2. 5 m depth during the growing season, while perennial ryegrass affected the inorganic soil N only down to 1 m depth (Thorup-Kristensen 2006). Further, on a Wakanui silt loam in New Zealand chicory extracted water down to 1. 9 m and lucerne down to 2. 3 m soil depth, which resulted in greater herbage yields compared with a perennial ryegrass-white clover mixture, especially for dryland plots (Brown et al. 2005). There is little information on both the ability of deep- and shallow-rooting grassland species to access soil N from different vertical soil layers and the relation of soil N-access and herbage yield in <b>temporary</b> agricultural <b>grasslands.</b> Therefore, {{the objective of the}} present work was to test the hypotheses 1) that a mixture comprising both shallow- and deep-rooting plant species has greater herbage yields than a shallow-rooting binary mixture and pure stands, 2) that deep-rooting plant species (chicory and lucerne) are superior in accessing soil N from 1. 2 m soil depth compared with shallow-rooting plant species, 3) that shallow-rooting plant species (perennial ryegrass and white clover) are superior in accessing soil N from 0. 4 m soil depth compared with deep-rooting plant species, 4) that a mixture of deep- and shallow-rooting plant species has greater access to soil N from three soil layers compared with a shallow-rooting two-species mixture and that 5) the leguminous grassland plants, lucerne and white clover, have a strong impact on grassland N acquisition, because of their ability to derive N from the soil and the atmosphere. ...|$|R

Ecological Focus Areas (EFAs) were introduced as a component of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 'greening' measures. Different options are available depending on those activated by individual Member States, but across Europe as a whole, they range from cover crops and agroforestry, to the protection and enhancement of boundary features. Eligible farms must have a minimum arable area (including fallow land, <b>temporary</b> <b>grassland</b> and crop land) of 15 ha, for which EFAs need to comprise 5 % of this area. The overall environmental benefits delivered by a given EFA option will depend on farm specific factors, and will vary between farms and Member States. In order to help account for this variability, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) commissioned the development of a software tool, the EFA calculator, to assist land managers in the selection of EFA elements appropriate to their farm, in order to optimise ecosystem services, biodiversity and farm management. A simple bespoke scoring system underpins the calculator but enables the distillation of complex and data-intensive parameters into a readily interpretable and user friendly format. Although multiple ecosystem services are accounted for by the tool, this paper will focus on pest control, specifically the impact of EFAs on ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and their potential role as beneficial insects.

Further, the mixtures doubled their dry matter accumulation in the two weeks just around grass heading. The systems partly buffered the time-wise differences {{in the sense that the}} P accumulation paralleled dry matter but the N was diluted. This was mirrored in a decrease in N concentration and maintenance of the concentration level of P and other elements. As the stem-leaf ratio was higher (P< 0. 05) in festulolium than in ryegrass and as the stems of festulolium has lower concentrations of N, K, Ca, S, Mg, Fe and Cu than leaves, the mixtures including festulolium had a rapidly declining proportion of these elements in the combined mixtures’ dry matter. Management options in improving the mineral supplies are thus to chose species when establishing the temporary grasslands according to functionality, to manipulate the content of legumes by the N supply level, and to time the harvest of the herbage...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Nutrient {{loadings}} {{from its}} catchment upon The Fleet, a highly valuable coastal lagoon in Southern England, were hindcast {{for the period}} AD 1866 – 2004, using a catchment model, export coefficients, and historical data on land use changes, livestock numbers, and human population. Agriculture was the main nutrient source throughout, other inputs representing minor contributions. Permanent pasture was historically the main land use, with <b>temporary</b> <b>grassland</b> and cereals increasing during the mid- 20 th century. Sheep, the main 19 th century livestock, were replaced by cattle during the 1930 s. Results Total nitrogen loadings rose from ca 41 t yr- 1 during the late 19 th century to 49 – 54 t yr- 1 for the mid- 20 th, increasing to 98 t yr- 1 by 1986. Current values are ca 77 t yr- 1. Total phosphorus loads increased from ca 0. 75 t yr- 1 for the late 19 th century to ca 1. 6 t yr- 1 for the mid- 20 th, reached ca 2. 2 t yr- 1 in 1986, and are now ca 1. 5 t yr- 1. Loadings rose most rapidly between 1946 and 1988, owing to increased use of inorganic fertilisers, and rising sheep and cattle numbers. Livestock were the main nutrient source throughout, but inputs from inorganic fertilisers increased after 1946, peaking in 1986. Sewage treatment works and other sources contribute little nitrogen, but ca 35 % of total phosphorus. Abbotsbury Swannery, an ancient Mute Swan community, provides ca 0. 5 % of total nitrogen, and ca 5 % of total phosphorus inputs. Conclusion The Fleet has been grossly overloaded with nitrogen since 1866, climaxing during the 1980 s. Total phosphorus inputs lay below 'permissible' limits until the 1980 s, exceeding them in inner, less tidal parts of the lagoon, during the 1940 s. Loadings on Abbotsbury Bay exceeded 'permissible' limits by the 1860 s, becoming 'dangerous' during the mid- 20 th century. Phosphorus stripping at point sources will not significantly reduce loadings to {{all parts of the}} lagoon. Installation of 5 m buffer strips throughout the catchment and shoreline will marginally affect nitrogen loadings, but will reduce phosphorus inputs to the West Fleet below 'permissible' limits. Only a combination of measures will significantly affect Abbotsbury Bay, where, without effluent diversion, loadings will remain beyond 'permissible'. </p...|$|E
40|$|Insight {{is needed}} into how {{management}} influences soil biota when sustainable grassland systems are developed. A crop rotation {{of grass and}} maize can be sustainable in terms of efficient nutrient use. However, there is lack {{of information on the}} effect of such a crop rotation on soil biological quality. Earthworms, nematodes, bacteria and fungi were sampled over three years in a 36 years old experiment. Permanent arable land was compared with permanent grassland and with a ley-arable crop rotation. In the rotation, a period of three years of grassland (<b>temporary</b> <b>grassland)</b> was followed by a period of three years of arable land (temporary arable land) and vice versa. In the first year of arable cropping in the rotation, the number of earthworms was already low and not different from continuous cropping. In the three-year grass ley, the abundance of earthworms returned to the level of permanent grassland in the second year. However, the restoration of earthworm biomass took a minimum of three years. Furthermore, the anecic species did not recover the dominance they had in the permanent grassland. The numbers of herbivorous and microbivorous nematodes in the ley-crop rotation reached similar levels to those in the permanent treatments within one to two years. Although the same holds for the nematode genera composition, the Maturity Index and the proportion of omnivorous nematodes in the temporary treatments remained significantly lower than in their permanent counterparts. Differences in recovery were also found among microbial parameters. In the temporary treatments, bacterial growth rate and the capacity to degrade a suite of substrates recovered in the second year. However, the Community-Level Physiological Profiles in the permanent grassland remained different from the other treatments. Our results suggest that many functions of soil biota that are well established in permanent grassland, are restored in a ley-arable crop rotation. However, due to a reduction in certain species, specific functions of these soil biota could be reduced or lost. The ley-arable crop rotations were intermediate to permanent grassland and continuous arable land in terms of functioning of soil biota (e. g., N-mineralization). In terms of the functional aspects of the soil biota, permanent grassland might be preferable wherever possible. For maize cultivation, a ley-arable crop rotation is preferable to continuous arable land. However, a ley-arable crop rotation is only preferable to continuous arable cropping if it is not practised at the expense of permanent grassland at farm level...|$|E

40|$|Land-use {{practices}} {{aiming at}} increasing agro-ecosystem sustainability, e. g. no-till systems {{and use of}} <b>temporary</b> <b>grasslands,</b> have been developed in cropping areas, but their environmental benefits could be counterbalanced by increased N 2 O emissions produced, in particular during denitrification. Modelling denitrification {{in this context is}} thus of major importance. However, to what extent can changes in denitrification be predicted by representing the denitrifying community as a black box, i. e. without an adequate representation of the biological characteristics (abundance and composition) of this community, remains unclear. We analysed the effect of changes in land uses on denitrifiers for two different agricultural systems: (i) crop/grassland conversion and (ii) cessation/application of tillage. We surveyed potential denitrification (PD), the abundance and genetic structure of denitrifiers (nitrite reducers), and soil environmental conditions. N 2 O emissions were also measured during periods of several days on control plots. Time-integrated N 2 O emissions and PD were well correlated among all control plots. Changes in PD were partly due to changes in denitrifier abundance but were not related to changes {{in the structure of the}} denitrifier community. Using multiple regression analysis, we showed that changes in PD were more related to changes in soil environmental conditions than in denitrifier abundance. Soil organic carbon explained 81...|$|R

Effect of age (1 to 4 -yr-old) and management (slurry, grazing multispecies mixture) of a grass phase mixed crop rotation on carbon sequestration and emissions upon cultivation was compared with 17 -yr-old grassland and a pea field as reference. Aboveground and root biomass were determined and soils were incubated to study CO 2 emissions after soil disturbance. Aboveground biomass was highest in 1 -yr-old grassland with slurry application and lowest in 4 -yr-old grassland without slurry application. Root biomass was highest in 4 -yr-old grassland, but all 1 to 4 -yr-old grasslands were {{in between the}} pea field (0. 81 ± 0. 094 g kg- 1 soil) and the 17 -yr-old grassland (3. 17 ± 0. 22 g kg- 1 soil).

40|$|Because of {{environmental}} and health safety issues, {{it is necessary to}} develop strategies that do not rely on herbicides to manage weeds. Introducing <b>temporary</b> <b>grassland</b> into annual crop rotations and mechanical weeding are the two main features that are frequently used in integrated and organic cropping systems for this purpose. To evaluate the contribution of these two factors in interaction with other cropping system components and environmental conditions, the present study updated an existing biophysical model (i. e. AlomySys) that quantifies the effects of cropping system on weed dynamics. Based on previous experiments, new sub-models were built to describe the effects on plant survival and growth reduction of mechanical weeding resulting from weed seedling uprooting and covering by soil, and those of grassland mowing resulting from tiller destruction. Additional modifications described the effect of the multi-year crop canopy of grassland on weed survival, growth, development and seed return to the soil. The improved model was used to evaluate the weed dynamics over 27 years in the conventional herbicide-based cropping system most frequently observed in farm surveys (i. e. oilseed rape/winter wheat/winter barley rotation with superficial tillage) and then to test prospective non-chemical scenarios. Preliminary simulations tested a large range of mechanical weeding and mowing strategies, varying operation frequencies, dates and, in the case of mechanical weeding, characteristics (i. e. tool, working depth, tractor speed). For mechanical weeding soon after sowing, harrowing was better than hoeing for controlling weed seed production. The later the operation, the more efficient the hoeing and the less efficient the harrowing. Tractor speed had little influence. Increasing tilling depth increased plant mortality but increased weed seed production because of additional seed germination triggering by the weeding tool. Decreasing the interrow width for hoeing was nefarious for weed control. The best combinations were triple hoeing in oilseed rape and sextuple harrowing in cereals. The best mowing strategy was mowing thrice, every 4 – 6 weeks, starting in mid-May. The best individual options were combined, simulated over 27 years and compared to the herbicide-based reference system. If herbicide applications were replaced solely by mechanical weeding, blackgrass infestation could not be satisfactorily controlled. If a three-year lucerne was introduced into the rotation, weed infestations were divided by ten. Replacing chisel by mouldboard ploughing before winter wheat reduced weed infestations at short, medium and long term to a level comparable to the herbicide-based reference system...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} awareness of the detrimental influence of diffuse sources of pollution on aquatic systems and of the integral role played by sediment in the mobilisation and transport of pollutants. The recognition of the environmental, societal and economic importance of the ecological health of aquatic environments has led to a change in emphasis regarding agricultural and environmental policy. To implement successful delivery of emerging policy requirements, there is a current need to have an enhanced understanding of the relationship between different forms of land use and sources of diffuse pollution, particularly sources of fine sediment. To understand the potential impacts of future land use changes, including environmental conservation measures on sources of sediment, it is useful to consider them within a longer-term context. This study has successfully applied the sediment source fingerprinting technique to floodplain overbank sediment cores in a retrospective study of six diverse UK river catchments with identified sediment problems. The varying estimates of relative sediment contributions from differing sources have been compared to known land use change in the study catchments over concurrent time periods, to explore any associations which might be apparent. Over the last 40 years, the increased cultivation of high erosion risk crops, such as those which are harvested late in the season (e. g. maize) and those which are sown in the autumn (e. g. winter wheat), has contributed disproportionately to the total sediment load relative to the area of land occupied by such cultivation. Increased stocking densities have resulted in increased relative sediment contributions from grassland sources, particularly intensively managed <b>temporary</b> <b>grassland,</b> but can have an even greater impact on sediment contributions derived from channel bank sources. The installation and maintenance of drainage for agriculture or for flood risk management has resulted in increased relative sediment loads from channel bank and associated sub-surface sources. Through the further development of such research, the efficacy of mitigation measures can be tested against evidence-based historic trends and those management approaches which provide identifiable improvements can be developed as best practice options for future land management targeted at reducing the negative impacts of excessive sediment ingress to river systems. The design of the source fingerprinting methodology used in this work was based on an established successful approach and this was developed further through the incorporation of a number of refinements designed to improve the robustness of the technique and expedite its implementation.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record. Soils deliver crucial ecosystem services, such as climate regulation through carbon (C) storage and food security, {{both of which are}} threatened by climate and land use change. While soils are important stores of terrestrial C, anthropogenic impact on the lateral fluxes of C from land to water remains poorly quantified and not well represented in Earth system models. In this study, we tested a novel framework for tracing and quantifying lateral C fluxes from the terrestrial to the aquatic environment at a catchment scale. The combined use of conservative plant-derived geochemical biomarkers n-alkanes and bulk stable δ(13) C and δ(15) N isotopes of soils and sediments allowed us to distinguish between particulate organic C sources from different land uses (i. e. arable and <b>temporary</b> <b>grassland</b> vs. permanent grassland vs. riparian woodland vs. river bed sediments) (p< 0. 001), showing an enhanced ability to distinguish between land use sources as compared to using just n-alkanes alone. The terrestrial-aquatic proxy (TAR) ratio derived from n-alkane signatures indicated an increased input of terrestrial-derived organic matter (OM) to lake sediments over the past 60 years, with an increasing contribution of woody vegetation shown by the C 27 /C 31 ratio. This may be related to agricultural intensification, leading to enhanced soil erosion, but also an increase in riparian woodland that may disconnect OM inputs from arable land uses in the upper parts of the study catchment. Spatial variability of geochemical proxies showed a close coupling between OM provenance and riparian land use, supporting the new conceptualization of river corridors (active river channel and riparian zone) as critical zones linking the terrestrial and aquatic C fluxes. Further testing of this novel tracing technique shows promise in terms of quantification of lateral C fluxes as well as targeting of effective land management measures to reduce soil erosion and promote OM conservation in river catchments.

40|$|In France about 45 % of the {{agricultural}} area is devoted to forage production, of which about 68 % is permanent grasslands (mountains and lowlands) and 19 % is <b>temporary</b> <b>grasslands,</b> generally associatedwith maize silage on dairy farms. Grasslands are often considered as beneficial for water quality, linked to their i) permanent soil cover and well-developed rhizosphere that provide a buffer for water quality;ii) frequently riparian location within a catchment and their border vegetation (e. g., hedgerows); and iii) usual management with moderate levels of nutrient input and no pesticides, enabling them to diluteand regulate diffuse pollution.

The residual effects of six different <b>temporary</b> <b>grasslands</b> (1994 - 96) on yield and nitrate leaching {{in the following}} cereal crops (1997 - 99) were investigated on a loamy sand in central Jutland. The grasslands were unfertilized grass-clover and fertilized ryegrass subject to cutting or continuous grazing by dairy cows with two levels of N in feed supplements. In the first year there was sufficient residual effect of the grazed grasslands to obviate the need for supplementary fertilizer, but in the following years gradually more fertilizer N was required to obtain optimal yields. Nitrate leaching decreased {{as a function of}} time after cultivation of grassland, but grassland management had little effect on the subsequent nitrate leaching (6 to 36 kg N/ha in unfertilized plots). Application of cattle slurry to cereals influenced nitrate leaching more than the history of the grassland and caused the annual mean nitrate concentration to exceed the EU Drinking Water Directive upper limit in most cases. Presumably, large differences in N-input during the grassland phase of the crop rotation had relatively little effect on the subsequent N release because of variable N losses during grazing. Possibilities for further improvement of the utilization of grassland N following cultivation are limited when the current knowledge has been implemented.
