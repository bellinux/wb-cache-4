25|$|Audi's 'trademark' quattro {{permanent}} (or semi-permanent, {{dependent on}} gearbox type) four-wheel drive system {{was the only}} offering for the drivetrain. This normally distributes the engine torque as a 'default' 50:50 between front and rear axles, but can automatically dynamically apportion up to a bias of 20:80 to 80:20 front and rear. The automatic transmission utilizes a hydraulically controlled multi-plate clutch to apportion drive between front and rear axles, whereas the manual transmission variants utilize a Torsen type 1 Torque Sensing center differential. The rear axle final drive unit contains a Torsen type 1 <b>Torque</b> <b>Sensing</b> <b>differential,</b> instead of the more common hypoid open differential.|$|E
50|$|The Amarok {{has three}} drive concepts: rear wheel drive, Shiftable 4Motion and Permanent 4Motion.The Shiftable {{all wheel drive}} system can shift drive between the axles whereas the Permanent {{full-time}} all wheel drive system distributes power through a <b>Torque</b> <b>Sensing</b> (Torsen) <b>differential</b> with a 40:60 ratio between {{the front and rear}} axles.|$|R

Drive to the front wheels is linked through a free-floating differential; drive to the rear wheels is transmitted via a 56/44 front/rear torque-splitting Ferguson viscous-coupling-controlled epicyclic central differential. At the rear wheels is a Torsen (<b>torque</b> <b>sensing)</b> rear <b>differential.</b> It divides the torque between the wheels according to the available grip, with a maximum lockup of 70%.|$|R
25|$|The 86, BRZ and FR-S {{are offered}} with two 6-speed transmissions, an {{in-house}} developed Toyota TL70 manual gearbox (based on Aisin AI's AZ6) and an Aisin-Warner A960E automatic transmission, which is modified from that {{used on the}} Lexus IS 250. The latter uses a traditional wet torque converter design, but its software has been engineered to mimic the response of a dual-clutch gearbox. The automatic transmission uses three different modes: Sport, Snow, and Normal. A <b>torque</b> <b>sensing</b> limited slip <b>differential</b> is standard on most models.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of human-robot cooperation {{and the demand}} of high-precision robot control have increasingly spurred the usage of joint torque sensors. A build-in torque sensor for harmonic drive is researched in this paper, which utilizes strain gauges attached {{to the surface of}} the flexspline to measure torque. As the strain signal is significantly affected by the rotation of wave generator, positioning error of strain gauges and uneven distribution of the load torque, a new <b>torque</b> <b>sensing</b> technique with on-line torque estimation is developed to eliminate disturbance and achieve better measurement precision. Meanwhile, the dynamic strain of flexspline is obtained by finite element method, which is utilized to optimize the layout of strain gauges for lower disturbance.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a new generation}} of torque-controlled lightweight robots (LWR) developed at the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics of the German Aerospace Center. In order to act in unstructured environments and interact with humans, the robots have design features and control/software functionalities which distinguish them from classical robots, such as: load-to-weight ratio of 1 : 1, <b>torque</b> <b>sensing</b> in the joints, active vibration damping, sensitive collision detection, as well as compliant control on joint and Cartesian level. Due to the partially unknown properties of the environment, robustness of planning and control with respect to environmental variations is crucial. After briefly describing the main hardware features, the paper focuses on showing how joint <b>torque</b> <b>sensing</b> (as a main feature of the robot) is consequently used for achieving the above mentioned performance, safety, and robustness properties.

Multi-mode DCCD AWD is able to operate in automatic mode or manual mode, where the driver is able to adjust the center differential lockup on the fly.|$|R
40|$|A {{controller}} {{design and}} tuning methodology is proposed that facilitates {{the rejection of}} periodic load-side disturbances applied to a torsional mechanical system, whilst simultaneously compensating for the disturbance observer's inherent phase delay, thereby facilitating the used of lower bandwidth, practically realisable, disturbance observers.

5000|$|Unlike other friction-based LSD {{designs that}} combine a common spider gear [...] "open" [...] {{differential}} {{in combination with}} friction materials that inhibit differentiation, the <b>torque</b> <b>sensing</b> design is a unique type of differential, with torque bias inherent to its design, not as an add-on.

It was standard on the 220 Turbo Coupé, and optional {{for the first year}} of production on the naturally aspirated 220 version. Critics at the time reported that the handling was marred by the power being rather clumsily transmitted through the front wheels. As a result, the handling dynamics fell short of its rivals.|$|R

40|$|Functional dry {{adhesives}} are dry adhesives {{that rely}} on dry adhesive structures for adhesion but also include additional functionality that enables adhesion switching or sensing capabilities. This thesis describes the design and testing of functional dry adhesives. Electro-dry-adhesives with flexible electrodes were fabricated. When a high voltage {{was applied to the}} flexible electrodes, fabricated from mixing and curing Carbon Black (CB) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), an electrostatic field was generated between opposing electrodes and between the Electro-dry-adhesive and the surface it was attached to. The generated electrostatic field resulted in an increased shear adhesion force over the shear adhesion measured without the applied electrostatic field applied as well as the ability to self-preload. Magnetic field switchable dry adhesives were designed with a backing layer composed of iron oxide particles embedded within PDMS. The design of the dry adhesive backing layer allowed increased or decreased measured adhesion forces when the magnetic field was present during only the pull-off portion of the normal dry adhesion test cycle depending on the orientation of the magnetic field. Decreased adhesion was observed when the magnetic field was present during either the entire adhesion test cycle or when the magnetic field was present during only the preload portion of the dry adhesion test cycle regardless of the orientation of the magnetic field. Force and <b>torque</b> <b>sensing</b> dry adhesives were designed and fabricated by molding CB-PDMS. Force sensing was observed when the device was both compressed and extended by measuring a change in the resistance across the device terminals. <b>Torque</b> <b>sensing</b> was observed when the dry adhesive backing layer was twisted again by comparing resistance changes across the device terminals. The design of the force and <b>torque</b> <b>sensing</b> dry adhesives allowed the user to differentiate between forces in compression and extension as well as torques. Finally, a low cost method of fabricating dry adhesives was developed that utilizes commercially available meshes as a mold. The ability to utilize commercially available meshes instead of cleanroom fabrication techniques may save on overall fabrication costs and allow dry adhesives to be fabricated in large sheets...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Variable Stiffness Actuation (VSA) {{devices are}} be-ing used to jointly {{address the issues}} of safety and {{performance}} in physical human-robot interaction. With reference to the VSA-II prototype, we present a feedback linearization approach that allows the simultaneous decoupling and accurate tracking of motion and stiffness reference profiles. The operative condi-tion that avoids control singularities is characterized. Moreover, a momentum-based collision detection scheme is introduced, which does not require joint <b>torque</b> <b>sensing</b> nor information on the time-varying stiffness of the device. Based on the residual signal, a collision reaction strategy is presented that {{takes advantage of the}} proposed nonlinear control to rapidly let the arm bounce away after detecting the impact, while limiting contact forces through a sudden reduction of the stiffness. Simulations results are reported to illustrate the performance and robustness of the overall approach. Extensions to the multi-dof case of robot manipulators equipped with VSA-II devices are also considered. I...|$|R

The universal controller has been used in an application involving a six-degree-of-freedom mechanical arm equipped with a six-dimensional force-torque sensor at its base. In this application, the hand controller acts as a position control input device to the arm, while forces and <b>torques</b> <b>sensed</b> {{at the base of the}} mechanical hand back drive the hand controller.
