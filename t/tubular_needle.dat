30|$|The {{significance}} of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{in the field}} of nanotechnology was noticed abundantly by the researchers, after the <b>tubular</b> <b>needle</b> growth model, proposed by the Ijima in 1991 [1]. The growth model of CNTs was proposed to be, the rolling up graphene-hexagon sheet into a cylinder shape to form a tubular structure. The CNTs growth model possess the similar way of the bacon’s scroll model [1]. CNTs are costly and highly demanded nanomaterial around the world, due to their excellent electrical conductivity [2], tensile strength [3] and thermal conductivity. An elastic modulus of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) is tenfold higher than the any commercial, industrial fiber [4].|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work {{describes}} a novel experimental setup {{which allows the}} measurement of the temperature field in the depth of injection moldings throughout the length of injection molding cycles and after ejection as well. An experimental device has been designed and realized, including a specific mold equipped with a <b>tubular</b> <b>needle</b> for guiding an embedded micro-thermocouple inside the cavity. Disturbance caused by the probe remains weak and under control. Temperature field modeling has been performed using Moldflow and Cat 1 D softwares. Cat 1 D is a thermal modeler developed at the OPERP laboratory. Measured depth temperature history slope coincides satisfactorily with the Cat 1 D computed one. Surface temperature measurements reveal some thermal singularities corresponding to modifications in the thermal boundary conditions during injection cycle phase changes. These temperature field evolution singularities, confirmed by Cat 1 D modeler, are due to the TRC phenomenon within the cavity and to the ejection point. The quantitative assessment of these phenomenon impacts appears essential to control injection molded part dimensions...|$|E

40|$|Computer-integrated surgery {{represents}} a growing segment {{of our national}} healthcare system. These systems transform preoperative images and other information into models of individual patients, assist clinicians in developing an optimized interventional plan, register this preoperative data to the actual patient in the operating room, and then {{use a variety of}} means, such as robots and image overlay displays, to assist in the accurate execution of the planned interventions. Finally, they perform complex postoperative analysis of the interventions. Borrowing analogies from industrial production systems, the process was named surgical CAD/CAM. Percutaneous (“through skin”) local therapies represent a significant portion of minimally invasive procedures. They involve the insertion of <b>tubular</b> therapy devices (<b>needles,</b> catheters, bone drills, screws, tissue ablating devices, etc.) into the body, with the guidance of intra-operative imaging devices, like CT, MRI, ultrasound, or fluoroscopy. Percutaneous systems also depend on sophisticated image acquisition and analysis tools. This paper provides an introduction to the surgical CAD/CAM paradigm and also presents an implementation of the paradigm for percutaneous local therapies. 1...|$|R
