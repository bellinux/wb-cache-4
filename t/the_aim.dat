Before this, engineering in sport was not popular as many people did not realize the important of engineering factors in sports. It was not discovered {{and most of the}} athletes depend on the experienced and their practice in order to achieve their target. This study will be focusing on <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> part and <b>the</b> factors that will affect <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> and concentration of the archery athletes. Based on this study, there are a few factors that will be determined to be the cause for the distraction of <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> phase. Corresponds to the project background and problem statements, it is decided that the objectives of the project are to analyse <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> techniques from archery athletes, to study the relationship between the heart rate and emotions with the performance and to relate <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> time with <b>the</b> shot points. The results from the analysis of heart rate proved that lower heart rate will distribute to a higher score. From the biofeedback device, the emotions level showed a distraction to the performance of the athletes. The increase of stress level can cause a lower accuracy during <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> phase and will distribute to a lower score. For <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> time, three parameters have been set up which are 3, 5 and 7 seconds. From this <b>aiming</b> time, <b>the</b> best total score is during <b>the</b> <b>aiming</b> time in 5 seconds...|$|R
