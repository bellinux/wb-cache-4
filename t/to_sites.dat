40|$|AbstractRat hepatocytes were {{maintained}} in monolayer culture for 20 h {{in the presence}} of 10 % (v/v) new-born calf serum and then for a further 1 – 24 h in serum-free medium containing 2 g bovine serum albumin/l. The specific binding of human 125 -I-LDL <b>to</b> two distinct <b>sites</b> was then measured at 4 °C. Binding <b>to</b> <b>site</b> 1 was displaced by dextran sulphate while that <b>to</b> <b>site</b> 2 was not. The presence of 1 – 100 nM insulin for 24 h in the second incubation significantly increased binding <b>to</b> <b>site</b> 1. Significant increases were also seen when cells were incubated with 10 nM insulin for 1 h. No significant effects of insulin on binding <b>to</b> <b>site</b> 2 were observed. In contrast, 10 nM— 1 μM dexamethasone decreased binding <b>to</b> both <b>sites.</b> The effects of these hormones were mutually antagonistic...|$|R

5|$|Along {{with the}} {{excavations}} at Gedi during the 1950s, concurrent excavations also {{took place at}} similar sites along the Swahili Coast. Wilson's 1982 survey of the 116 sites along the coast found 34 isolated ruins, which he concluded likely contained possible settlements or isolated dwellings. Although smaller settlements were studied, larger sites received the most attention. Other than Gedi, the site most intensively excavated was Ungwana {{at the mouth of}} the Tana River, which was similar in size to Gedi. However, compared <b>to</b> <b>sites</b> similar in size, Gedi had one of the more densely populated urban centers.|$|E

The lower humidity of these areas made them more suitable for a gaseous diffusion plant, but the Clinton Engineer Works site was immediately available and otherwise suitable.

5|$|Early {{conceptual}} {{designs of}} the Pod itself were based, as it {{existed in the}} novel, {{on one of the}} primary shapes in geometry, a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided figure. Eventually the Pod was modified to a spherical capsule that encases the traveler. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the Kennedy Space Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials allowed them access <b>to</b> <b>sites</b> off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the space shuttle. There, they concentrated on the mechanics of the elevator and the gantry area and loading arm. The resulting photographs and research were incorporated into the design of the machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod itself, the interior of the elevator, and the gantry, which took almost four months to build. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{instituted a}} series of reforms. He {{installed}} phone lines for the Supervising Construction Quartermasters, demanded weekly reports on progress, ordered that reimbursement vouchers be processed within a week, and sent expediters <b>to</b> <b>sites</b> reporting shortages. He ordered his contractors to hire whatever special equipment they needed and to pay premium prices if necessary to guarantee quick delivery. Instead of allowing construction of camps to proceed in whatever order the contractors saw fit, Groves laid down priorities for completion of camp facilities, so that the troops could begin moving in even while construction was still under way. By mid-December, {{the worst of the}} crisis was over. Over half a million men had been mobilized and essential accommodations and facilities for two million men were 95 per cent complete. Between 1 July 1940 and 10 December 1941, the Construction Division let contracts worth $1,676,293,000 ($ with inflation), of which $1,347,991,000 ($ with inflation), or about 80 per cent, were fixed-fee contracts.|$|E

Greenleaf {{decided that the}} right to harvest ice would be divided up in proportion with the amount of the shore line owned by the different claimants; from then onwards, the rights to harvest ice could be bought and sold and the value of land adjacent <b>to</b> <b>sites</b> such as Fresh Pond increased rapidly, with one owner who purchased land at $130 ($2,500 in 2010 terms) an acre (0.4 hectares) in the 1820s refusing an offer of $2,000 ($44,000) an acre by the 1850s.|$|E

The Chrysler Building was thus the first man-made structure to be taller than , and as one newspaper noted, the tower was also taller than the highest points of five states. The new Chrysler Building, appraised at $14 million, was also exempt from city taxes as per an 1859 law that gave tax exemptions <b>to</b> <b>sites</b> owned by the Cooper Union. Although the city had attempted to repeal the tax exemption, Cooper Union opposed that measure, and because the Chrysler Building retains the tax exemption, it has paid Cooper Union for the use of their land since opening.|$|E
5|$|The cytosol has {{no single}} {{function}} and is instead {{the site of}} multiple cell processes. Examples of these processes include signal transduction from the cell membrane <b>to</b> <b>sites</b> within the cell, such as the cell nucleus, or organelles. This compartment is also the site {{of many of the}} processes of cytokinesis, after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane in mitosis. Another major function of cytosol is to transport metabolites from their site of production to where they are used. This is relatively simple for water-soluble molecules, such as amino acids, which can diffuse rapidly through the cytosol. However, hydrophobic molecules, such as fatty acids or sterols, can be transported through the cytosol by specific binding proteins, which shuttle these molecules between cell membranes. Molecules taken into the cell by endocytosis or on their way to be secreted can also be transported through the cytosol inside vesicles, which are small spheres of lipids that are moved along the cytoskeleton by motor proteins.|$|E

5|$|The Maya sculptural {{tradition}} {{that produced the}} stelae emerged fully formed and had probably been preceded by sculpted wooden monuments. However the tradition of raising stelae had its origin elsewhere in Mesoamerica, among the Olmecs of the Gulf Coast of Mexico. In the Late Preclassic it then spread into the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and southwards along the Pacific Coast <b>to</b> <b>sites</b> such as Chiapa de Corzo, Izapa and Takalik Abaj where Mesoamerican Long Count calendar dates began to be carved onto the stelae. Although at Izapa the stelae depicted mythological scenes, at Takalik Abaj they began to show rulers in Early Classic Maya posture accompanied by calendrical dates and hieroglyphic texts. It was also at Takalik Abaj and Izapa that these stelae began to be paired with circular altars. By approximately 400BC, {{near the end of}} the Middle Preclassic Period, early Maya rulers were raising stelae that celebrated their achievements and validated their right to rule. At ElPortón in the Salamá Valley of highland Guatemala a carved schist stela (Monument1) was erected, the badly eroded hieroglyphs appear to be a very early form of Maya writing and may even be the earliest known example of Maya script. It was associated with a plain altar in a typical stela-altar pairing that would become common across the Maya area. Stela 11 from Kaminaljuyu, a major Preclassic highland city, dates to the Middle Preclassic and is the earliest stela to depict a standing ruler. The sculpted Preclassic stelae from Kaminaljuyu and other cities in the region, such as Chalchuapa in ElSalvador and Chocolá in the Pacific lowlands, tend to depict political succession, sacrifice and warfare.|$|E
