On 1 November 2006, the Xinhua News Agency published the information on its military website <b>that</b> <b>China</b> planned to introduce the Su-33. China had previously obtained a manufacturing license for Su-27 production.|$|E

5|$|Chinese and North Vietnamese {{documents}} {{state that}} relations between them worsened in 1973–75. A Vietnamese document claimed <b>that</b> <b>China</b> hindered the eventual reunification, while Chinese documents {{claimed that the}} source of the conflict was Vietnamese policy towards the Spratly and the Paracel Islands. However, the core issue for the Chinese was to minimize Vietnam's cooperation with the Soviets. Increasing Soviet/Vietnamese cooperation left China ambivalent about reunification.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{over the}} sale of the Su-35 proved {{protracted}} due to concerns over intellectual property rights. Since China had reverse engineered the Su-27SK and Su-33 to create the J-11B and J-15, respectively, there were concerns <b>that</b> <b>China</b> would copy the airframe and offer the copied design on the export market. At one stage Rosoboronexport demanded <b>that</b> <b>China</b> provided a legally-binding guarantee against copying. However, industry sources believed that Chinese industry was interested in the AL-41FS1 engine and Irbis-E radar. According to The Diplomat, China was specifically interested in the engine of the Su-35, as the country was already test flying the J-11D. While the aircraft reportedly has less range, payload and manoeuvrability than the Su-35, the J-11D has an active electronically-scanned array radar, instead of the less-advanced PESA radar as found on the Su-35. Various reports have drawn attention to the need for Chinese industry to close the technological gap between its engine industry and those of the US, Europe and Russia.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{concerns}} over the Games, or China's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities, including allegations <b>that</b> <b>China</b> violated its pledge to allow open media access, various alleged human rights violations, its continuous support of repressive regimes (such as Zimbabwe, Myanmar, Sudan and North Korea), air pollution in both the city of Beijing and in neighbouring areas, proposed boycotts, warnings {{of the possibility that}} the Beijing Olympics could be targeted by terrorist groups, disruption from pro-Tibetan protesters, and religious persecutions.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the success}} of the Chinese First Phase Campaign, the UN {{planners}} still believed <b>that</b> <b>China</b> had not intervened in Korea on a large scale. The suddenness of the Chinese withdrawal {{in the face of a}} victory further reinforced this belief. Working on the assumption that only 30,000 Chinese troops could remain hidden in the hills, General Douglas MacArthur ordered the bombing of the bridges over the Yalu River in an effort to cut off Chinese reinforcements. Confident that the UN air force could detect and disrupt any troop movements across the Yalu River, MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive on November 24 to rout the remaining Chinese and North Korean forces and to end the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Du Bois {{opposed the}} U.S. {{intervention}} in World War II, {{particularly in the}} Pacific, because he believed <b>that</b> <b>China</b> and Japan were emerging from the clutches of white imperialists. He felt that the European Allies waging war against Japan was an opportunity for whites to reestablish their influence in Asia. He was deeply disappointed by the US government's plan for African Americans in the armed forces: Blacks were limited to 5.8% of the force, and {{there were to be}} no African-American combat units– virtually the same restrictions as in World War I.The military later changed its policy, and units such as the Tuskegee Airmen saw combat. With blacks threatening to shift their support to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Republican opponent in the 1940 election, Roosevelt appointed a few blacks to leadership posts in the military.|$|E

Most analysts appear to agree <b>that</b> <b>China’s</b> primary interest {{in the region is}} to gain greater access to needed resources — such as oil, copper, and iron — through increased trade and investment. Some also believe Beijing’s additional goal is to isolate Taiwan by luring the 12 Latin American and Caribbean nations still maintaining diplomatic relations with Taiwan to shift their diplomatic recognition to China. Some analysts maintain <b>that</b> <b>China’s</b> involvement in the region could pose a future threat to U. S. influence. Others assert <b>that</b> <b>China’s</b> inroads in Latin America are marginal and likely to remain overwhelmed by the economic and geographic advantage of the U. S. market...|$|R
5|$|For much of 2009 and 2010, China {{was under}} {{pressure}} from the US to allow the yuan to appreciate. Between June and October 2010, China allowed a 2% appreciation, but there were concerns from Western observers <b>that</b> <b>China</b> only relaxed its intervention when under heavy pressure. The fixed peg was not abandoned until just before the June G20 meeting, after which the yuan appreciated by about 1%, only to devalue slowly again, until further US pressure in September when it again appreciated relatively steeply, just prior to the September US Congressional hearings to discuss measures to force a revaluation.|$|E
5|$|Having decisively won {{the battle}} and once again turned the tide {{of the war in}} favor of the Communists, the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River {{represented}} the peak of the Chinese military's performance in Korea. However, Mao interpreted the UN ceasefire as a weakness <b>that</b> <b>China</b> should further exploit. Against advice from Peng and other senior military leaders, Mao ordered the PVA to invade South Korea—a mission that was beyond the Chinese military's abilities while breaking the fragile Chinese supply lines. Recognizing the Chinese difficulties, Ridgway then led the Eighth Army to inflict severe losses on the PVA during the Chinese offensives of 1951.|$|E

5|$|Khrushchev greatly {{improved}} relations with Yugoslavia, {{which had been}} entirely sundered in 1948 when Stalin realized he could not control Yugoslav leader Josip Tito. Khrushchev led a Soviet delegation to Belgrade in 1955. Though a hostile Tito did {{everything he could to}} make the Soviets look foolish (including getting them drunk in public), Khrushchev was successful in warming relations, ending the Informbiro period in Soviet-Yugoslav relations. During the Hungarian crisis, Tito initially supported Nagy, but Khrushchev persuaded him of the need for intervention. Still, the intervention in Hungary damaged Moscow's relationship with Belgrade, which Khrushchev spent several years trying to repair. He was hampered by the fact <b>that</b> <b>China</b> disapproved of Yugoslavia's liberal version of communism, and attempts to conciliate Belgrade resulted in an angry Beijing.|$|E
5|$|Lê Duẩn visited China from 20–25 November 1977 to seek aid. CPC Chairman Hua Guofeng {{stated that}} Sino/Vietnamese {{relations}} had deteriorated because they held different principles. Hua insisted <b>that</b> <b>China</b> {{could not help}} Vietnam because of its own economic difficulties and differences in principles. Lê Duẩn countered that the only difference was how they viewed the Soviet Union and the United States. Following his visit, China (Xinhua) condemned COMECON. China halted all economic development projects between May and July 1978. During this period total Chinese aid to Vietnam amounted to $300 million.|$|E
5|$|North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950. After {{receiving}} its endorsement {{from the}} United Nations, the United States landed its first troops in Korea on September 15. On October 1, {{the first anniversary}} of the founding of the People's Republic, UN forces crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea. There was some disagreement within China's leadership about how to react to the American push to the Chinese border: Mao and Zhou wanted direct military intervention, while most Chinese leaders believed <b>that</b> <b>China</b> should not enter the war unless China was directly attacked. Lin Biao was Mao's first choice to lead the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) into Korea, but Lin refused, citing his bad health.|$|E

40|$|Since China's {{accession}} to the World Trade Organization in 2001, annual {{growth rates of}} its imports and exports have increased, and raised tensions between China {{and some of its}} major trading partners. Using a gravity model of trade, we find <b>that</b> <b>China's</b> orientation toward foreign trade is much greater than expected for an economy of its size and level of development. Our analysis shows <b>that</b> <b>China's</b> excessive orientation toward foreign trade ("over-trading") varies substantially across countries and we consider various explanations for the over-trading. A comparison of China's export boom with the earlier export booms of more market-based East and Southeast Asian economies shows <b>that</b> <b>China's</b> export boom has exceeded earlier booms in magnitude but not in duration. We conclude with a discussion of the likely scale of future export and import flows from and to China. China Trade Gravity model Over-trading Export boom...|$|R
5|$|On November 15, {{near the}} end of the Battle of Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek convened a meeting of the Military Affairs Commission's Supreme National Defense Council to {{undertake}} strategic planning, including a decision on what to do in case of a Japanese attack on Nanking. Here Chiang insisted fervently on mounting a sustained defense of Nanking. Chiang argued, just as he had during the Battle of Shanghai, <b>that</b> <b>China</b> would be more likely to receive aid from the great powers, possibly at the ongoing Nine Power Treaty Conference, if it could prove on the battlefield its will and capacity to resist the Japanese. He also noted that holding onto Nanking would strengthen China's hand in peace talks which he wanted the German ambassador Oskar Trautmann to mediate.|$|E
5|$|Sukhoi {{is working}} on a more {{advanced}} version, the Su-33K, a development to integrate the advanced technologies of the Su-35 fighters into the older Su-33 airframe. However, worries over other Chinese intentions emerged when it was reported <b>that</b> <b>China</b> had acquired one of the T-10Ks, a Su-33 prototype, from Ukraine, potentially to study and reverse engineer a domestic version. Various aircraft are alleged to have originated partially from the Su-33, such as the Shenyang J-15. Photos of Shenyang aircraft designers posing in front of a T-10K carrier based fighter prototype strongly suggest that the J-15 is directly related to T-10K. Negotiations stagnated as the Shenyang Aircraft company sought to reduce Russian content in the aircraft, while Sukhoi wanted to ensure a level of income from future upgrades and modifications made to the J-11.|$|E

40|$|Dani Rodrik argues <b>that</b> <b>China's</b> {{exports are}} unusually {{sophisticated}} {{for a country}} at its income level. He also claims <b>that</b> <b>China's</b> export sophistication reflects the government's successful industrial policy and {{has been instrumental in}} the recent acceleration of its economic growth. Although Rodrik's interpretation of China's economic growth is broadly correct, the accuracy of his empirical analysis is questionable. This note identifies several problems regarding the "export sophistication" index used in his empirical work and casts doubt on his analysis.
