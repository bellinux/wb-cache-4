Then, {{from the}} surrounding black and silence, came two thin, ominous, stringed musical notes of the theorbo instrument that seemed to herald, if not some portent of doom, certainly not tidings of joy, either. And then she emerged: a woman with short, straight black hair in a plain black dress. She stood {{for a few moments}} alone on the stage in the spotlight, gazing out at the audience with {{what seemed to be a}} mixture of hopelessness, desperation, and a curious kind of veiled dignity. After a few moments, she slowly turned from her viewers and began to ascend the impressive set, leaving the audience with the striking memory of that arresting stare. As it was with this dramatic opening, in many instances of the Chicago Opera Theater’s March 26 dress rehearsal of Claudio Monteverdi’s Il Ritorno d’Ulisse in Patria (“The Return of Ulysses”), a character’s silences often communicated much more than his or her actual lines.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the design is to show the desire of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> through her {{sexuality}} while also following her belief of modesty. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> with <b>a</b> lot of creativity and elegance. She wants to show every unique side to her. I wanted to challenge my design abilities by doing a garment I have not done before. Using a slippery fabric and a fitted top, it gave the garment the class, elegance, and sex appeal I desired. The colors show the creative side of her while the flow gives her elegance. Process: Before beginning the sketches for my designs, images were collected for inspiration and design elements. The inspiration was primarily photos of Muslim women, who are often viewed as oppressed, but these photos show the creativity {{in which they have}} control over their fashion. To me, this represented strong women who are fun and creative while still being able to practice modesty for their beliefs. In order to show a modest look while giving a little sex appeal, I chose to gather the skirt at the waist using a lot of fabric while keeping a slit up to show the leg while she’s walking. Not only fashions and prints were inspiration but also architecture and colors of the Middle East including mosques as well as Jewish synagogues across Israel and Lebanon. Techniques: Draping and flat patterning methods were used to create this garment. The top of the dress is flat-patterned and then altered to fit the model’s bust. The skirt was solely draped at the waist and cut for each panel, then the front seam was left partially opened up the leg. The materials include 1 -¼ yards of the top skirt sheer organza fabric {{as well as for the}} black sheer lining fabric underneath. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> half a yard of the top woven fabric used as well as for the neck and armhole facings. Contribution to fashion: A lot of playful colors and lines gives a feminine look to the garments. Architectural and geometric design elements that show strength in the look as well. The flow of the skirt with the high slit shows boldness while the movement gives elegance. Materials: Woven fabric, zipper, interfacing, polyester thread. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> one in <b>a</b> line of three garments; the entire line can be seen at the Apparel, Textiles, and Merchandising spring fashion show, May 30, at 3 : 00 p. m. and 7 : 00 p. m. in Milo Smith Theater in McConnell Hall...|$|R
