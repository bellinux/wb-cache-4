One is a soft plastic 10-inch version that includes a series of projected stills from the film on his stomach, which can be changed when the figure's arm is moved, and which emits accompanying sounds. Deluxe Flying Baymax, which retails for $39.99, depicts the armored version of the character and features lights and sounds that activate at <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> button. Placing the Hiro figurine on his back changes the sounds into speech and when the figure is tilted, the sounds are those of flying. The Armor-Up Baymax (original retail cost $19.99) comes with 20 pieces of armor that can be assembled onto the robot by the owner. The other characters from the film, including the other members of team and Professor Callaghan (who is called Yokai) are issued in 4-inch action figures, each of which have eight points of articulation.|$|E

500|$|Light gun {{shooters}} typically feature [...] "on-rails" [...] movement, {{which gives}} the player no control over the direction the protagonist moves in; the player only has control over aiming and shooting.

Other games may eschew on-rails movement altogether and allow the player to move the protagonist freely around the game's environment; still others may feature a static environment.

2500|$|A sliding knife is a knife {{that can}} be opened by sliding the knife blade out {{the front of the}} handle.

2500|$|Marshall {{began to}} see more {{competition}} from American amplifier companies such as Mesa Boogie and Soldano. Marshall then updated the JCM800 range with additional models and new features such as [...] "channel switching", which meant that players could switch between clean and distorted tones with <b>the</b> <b>push</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> foot-operated switch. This feature debuted in the 2205 (50 watt) and 2210 (100 watt) series and these amps contained more pre-amp gain than ever thanks to a new innovation; diode clipping. This meant a solid-state diode added additional distortion to the signal path, akin to adding a distortion pedal. As such the split channel JCM800s were the highest gain Marshalls yet built – [...] "When they were first released, many players were shocked (some were even put off) by its bright, intense distortion – far {{more than any other}} amp of the day." [...] While hotly criticised today among valve purists, these amps were more popular than ever, finding mass acceptance within the hard rock community and still in use today by many. The split-channel JCM800s are still used by Tom Morello (Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave) and were played exclusively by Michael Schenker (UFO) for many years.|$|E

50|$|Overblowing is a {{technique}} used while playing a wind instrument which, primarily through manipulation of the supplied air (versus, e.g., a fingering change or operation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> slide), causes the sounded pitch to jump to a higher one. Depending on the instrument (and less so on the player), overblowing may involve a change in air pressure, in {{the point at which}} the air is directed, or in the resonance characteristics of the chamber formed by the mouth and throat <b>of</b> the player (<b>a</b> feature <b>of</b> embouchure). In some instruments, overblowing may also involve the direct manipulation of the vibrating reed(s), and/or <b>the</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> register key while otherwise leaving fingering unaltered. With the exception of harmonica overblowing, the pitch jump is from one vibratory mode of the reed or air column, e.g., its fundamental, to an overtone. Overblowing can be done deliberately in order to get a higher pitch, or inadvertently, resulting in the production <b>of</b> <b>a</b> note other than that intended.|$|R
