5|$|Beside {{the many}} authors who were {{attracted}} into Dada through his promotional activities, Tzara {{was able to}} influence successive generations of writers. This {{was the case in}} his homeland during 1928, when the first avant-garde manifesto issued by unu magazine, written by Sașa Pană and Moldov, cited as its mentors Tzara, writers Breton, Ribemont-Dessaignes, Vinea, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, and Tudor Arghezi, as well as artists Constantin Brâncuși and Theo van Doesburg. One of the Romanian writers to claim inspiration from Tzara was Jacques G. Costin, who nevertheless offered an equally good reception to both Dadaism and Futurism, while Ilarie Voronca's Zodiac cycle, first published in France, is traditionally seen as indebted to The Approximate Man. The Kabbalist and Surrealist author Marcel Avramescu, who wrote during the 1930s, also appears to have been directly inspired by Tzara's views on art. Other authors from <b>that</b> <b>generation</b> to have been inspired by Tzara were Polish Futurist writer Bruno Jasieński, Japanese poet and Zen thinker Takahashi Shinkichi, and Chilean poet and Dadaist sympathizer Vicente Huidobro, who cited him as a precursor for his own Creacionismo.|$|E

40|$|The Chichilnisky {{criterion}} of intergenerational equity is time-inconsistent {{and has no}} optimal solution in the Ramsey model. Hence, seeking optimality is both irrelevant and futile.

The time-discounted utilitarian optimum is the unique equilibrium path when the initial stock is small, implying that the weight on the infinite future in the Chichilnisky criterion plays no role.

25|$|The Druze {{religion}} branched {{off from}} the religion of Islam, and although it is considered as its own religion separate from Islam, some Druze people still consider themselves to be Muslims.

Conversions are not permitted in the Druze religion, because they believe that the first generation after the establishment of the Druze religion had an opportunity then to join the religion, and everyone alive today is reincarnated from <b>that</b> <b>generation.</b> Much like the Abrahamic faiths, the Druze religion is monotheistic, and recognize many prophets including Jesus, John the Baptist, Mohammed, and Moses.

25|$|Morente {{arrived back}} to {{orthodox}} flamenco singing with his recording Homenaje a Don Antonio Chacón (Homage to Antonio Chacón, 1977), which obtained the National Award for best folk music album, {{granted by the}} Ministry of Culture.

25|$|He had {{excellent}} parts, {{which had}} been improved by parliamentary and diplomatic experience; but the infirmities of his temper detracted much from the effective strength of his abilities. Negotiator and courtier as he was, he never learnt the art of governing or of concealing his emotions. When prosperous, he was insolent and boastful; when he sustained a check, his undisguised mortification doubled the triumph of his enemies: very slight provocations sufficed to kindle his anger; {{and when he was}} angry he said bitter things which he forgot {{as soon as he was}} pacified, but which others remembered many years. His quickness and penetration would have made him a consummate man of business but for his selfsufficiency and impatience. His writings prove that he had many of the qualities of an orator: but his irritability prevented him from doing himself justice in debate: for nothing was easier than to goad him into a passion; and, from the moment when he went into a passion, he was at the mercy of opponents far inferior to him in capacity. Unlike most of the leading politicians of <b>that</b> <b>generation,</b> he was a consistent, dogged, and rancorous party man, a Cavalier of the old school, a zealous champion of the Crown and of the Church, and a hater of Republicans and Nonconformists. He had consequently a great body of personal adherents. The clergy especially looked on him as their own man, and extended to his foibles an indulgence of which, to say the truth, he stood in some need, for he drank deep, and when was in a rage—and he very often was in a rage—he swore like a porter.|$|E
