500|$|Meanwhile, at {{the summer}} camp, young bully Nathan and his lackey Mimsy plot to destroy Jimmy during the {{athletic}} competitions so Nathan can be declared the camp's champion. This sub-plot is also narrated in the same style as Intervention. Nathan uses Mimsy as a minion {{to carry out his}} plans to harm Jimmy, but is repeatedly foiled by Mimsy, who either misinterprets his instructions or takes them too literally and causes his plans to backfire. [...] Nathan tries to plant a black mamba in Jimmy's canoe during a race, but Mimsy instead leaves it in Nathan's canoe (when told to put it [...] "in the canoe"). Subsequently, Nathan tries to lead Jimmy's team into dangerous Indian territory during a scavenger hunt, but instead Mimsy switches the maps and switches them again (Nathan demanded him to [...] "Switch the maps! Switch the maps!"), and leads Nathan's team there. When Nathan tries to use a whistle with a shark mating call against Jimmy, Mimsy, who was supposed <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> underwater, instead swims in the water briefly then blows the whistle on land and a shark jumps {{out of the water and}} anally rapes Nathan with its nine-inch long penis, according to the Colorado National Wildlife Association. During the talent show, Nathan rigs Jimmy's ukulele with C-4, hoping it will explode during a solo, but when Jimmy cannot perform the solo correctly, Mimsy starts to show Jimmy the correct notes. Nathan interrupts and confronts Mimsy about his failure to follow orders. With a lapse of judgment, Nathan plays the correct notes and causes the ukulele to explode, knocking him away before being further injured by his past plans attacking him again. The ukulele solo is spoofing the Looney Tunes repeated use of the Xylophone gag, where the last note of Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms, is booby trapped, but the protagonist always somehow manages to play it wrong. Nathan is subsequently escorted to an ambulance, but is given the champion's crown by Jimmy. Nathan tells Jimmy he hates him anyway before he is sent away to the hospital.|$|E

40|$|Of {{the many}} {{challenges}} in public sector management, few are {{as complex as}} the management of whistleblowing. Because {{it can lead to}} the discovery and rectification of wrongdoing, public interest whistleblowing is widely acknowledged as being positive for organisations and for society at large. However, the conflicts and reprisal risks often associated with whistleblowing also support a widespread belief that every whistleblower is destined to suffer, and nothing can be done to protect them from reprisals. Even if they did it once, sensible employees are often seen as unlikely <b>to</b> ever <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> a second time around. The extensive research in this book reveals a more complex and, fortunately, more positive picture. The product of one of the world’s most comprehensive research projects on whistleblowing, evidence from over 8, 000 public servants in over 100 federal, state and local government agencies shows that whistleblowers can and do survive, and that often their role is highly valued. Public sector managers face significant challenges in better managing and protecting whistleblowers. There is great variation between the many public agencies making the effort, and the many agencies where the outcomes — for managers and whistleblowers alike — are still likely to be grim. This book is compulsory reading for all public sector managers who wish to turn this negative trend around, and for anyone interested in public accountability generally...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhistleblowing is {{the act of}} {{disclosing}} {{information from}} a public or private organization in order to reveal cases of corruption that are of immediate or potential danger <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public. <b>Blowing</b> <b>the</b> <b>whistle</b> involves personal risk, especially when legal protection is absent, and charges of betrayal, which often {{come in the form}} of legal prosecution under treason laws. In this article we argue that whistleblowing is justified when disclosures are made with the proper intent and fulfill specific communicative constraints in addressing issues of public interest. Three communicative constraints of informativeness, truthfulness and evidence are discussed in this regard. We develop a ‘harm test’ to assess the intent for disclosures, concluding that it is not sufficient for justification. Along with the proper intent, a successful act of whistleblowing should provide information that serves the public interest. Taking cognizance of the varied conceptions of public interest, we present an account of public interest that fits the framework of whistleblowing disclosures. In particular, we argue that whistleblowing is justified inter alia when the information it conveys is of a presumptive interest for a public insofar as it reveals an instance of injustice or violation of a civil or political right done against and unbeknown to some members of a polity...|$|R
