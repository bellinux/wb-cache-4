5|$|Interpretations vary. The canvas {{seems to}} portray {{simultaneously}} a dreaming {{woman and the}} content of her nightmare. The incubus and horse's head refer to contemporary belief and folklore about nightmares, but have been ascribed more specific meanings by some theorists. Contemporary critics were <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the overt sexuality of the painting, since interpreted by some scholars as anticipating Jungian ideas about the unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Waters Davis stipulated in his sale to Deering {{that the}} Cape Florida {{lighthouse}} be restored. Deering {{wrote to the}} U.S. government seeking specifications and guidelines for the lighthouse. Government officials were <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the request, wondering how a federal lighthouse could have passed into private hands. An Act of Congress and two Executive Orders, in 1847 and 1897, had reserved the island for the federal lighthouse and for military purposes. Patient legal work eventually convinced the U.S. Congress and President Woodrow Wilson to agree to recognize Matheson's and Deering's ownership of Key Biscayne.|$|E
25|$|Apparently <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the {{critical}} reception of this novel, and {{the critical}} outcry when {{he was awarded the}} Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962, Steinbeck published no more fiction in the next six years before his death.|$|E
60|$|Matt was <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> {{somewhat}} <b>by</b> {{this unexpected}} reply, {{and his face}} showed it.|$|R
6000|$|Next {{morning the}} {{population}} of Nopolis were <b>taken</b> all <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> reading in 'The Tea-Pot,' the following extraordinary leader: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, I've got {{two of them}} if {{you come}} to that," [...] he answered, <b>taken</b> rather <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the brusque and {{apparently}} irrelevant nature of the question.|$|R
25|$|The {{attitude}} of Soviet soldiers was ambiguous. Many committed atrocities, most notably rape and murder, {{and did not}} always distinguish between Poles and Germans, mistreating them equally. Other Soviets, were <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the brutal treatment of the German civilians and tried to protect them.|$|E
25|$|Many {{fans of the}} {{original}} Squad Leader game who had looked forward to improvements to the system {{with the release of}} Advanced Squad Leader were <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the need to replace the four modules they had bought; only the mapboards of the earlier series were compatible with the new game.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{returning}} to the U.S., Miller became rabbi of Congregation Agudath Shalom in Chelsea, Massachusetts. Initially, the community was <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> Miller's audacious pedagogy, and {{the sheer volume of}} his Torah presentations, attempting in vain to restrain his unconventional approach. Within a few years however, the community had changed their minds, desiring for Miller to stay longer.|$|E
60|$|Never have I seen {{my friend}} more {{completely}} <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> than <b>by</b> the cabman's reply. For an instant {{he sat in}} silent amazement. Then he burst into a hearty laugh.|$|R
6000|$|Kate was <b>taken</b> quite <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> this summary {{method of}} coming to the point. Repulsing him energetically, she exclaimed, while she blushed crimson, [...] "O Harry--Mr Somerville!" [...] and burst into tears.|$|R
6000|$|It <b>took</b> her <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> its directness, and for {{a moment}} left her without an answer. Then: [...] "I think you had better leave me," [...] she told him frostily. [...] "You forget yourself." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1975, CHS {{became the}} first {{alternative}} school in Michigan to receive accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Accreditation officials, according to news reports, were mildly <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the school's eccentricities, questioning {{the lack of any}} non-smoking area within the school and some students' practice of bringing their pets to school.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Nixon {{arranged}} {{an interview}} with British journalist David Frost {{in the hopes of}} improving his legacy. Based on a previous interview in 1968, he believed that Frost would be an easy interviewer and was <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> Frost's incisive questions. The interview displayed the entire scandal to the American people, and Nixon formally apologized, but his legacy remained tarnished.|$|E
25|$|Captain Lee, {{who was in}} {{his private}} cabin {{at the time of}} the incident, {{immediately}} rushed to the bridge. After a short period, all the ship's mates and helmsmen arrived there as well. Around this time, the chief engineer stopped the engines, although it is unknown whether it was on his own volition or following an order from Captain Lee. At 8:50, the chief engineer ordered an evacuation of the engine room through a call to the assistant engineer. During this time, Park was crying, as she was <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the sudden incident; this lasted until at least 9:06a.m.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh--ah--precisely," [...] {{said the}} knight, <b>taken</b> {{somewhat}} <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> {{the nature and}} brevity of the answer, [...] "that of course; but I meant, how do you proceed? What is the method, and what the machinery that you put in motion?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Poor little maid! {{of course}} I had to quench her,' said Felix, {{as far as}} her own day was concerned. I told her more about it {{than she had ever}} heard, but then she <b>took</b> me <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> saying Father was happy, and she thought he would like her to be happy.' ...|$|R
25|$|Some {{relatives}} of the victims in the case were <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the announcement of a Crown appeal, especially because Attorney-General Wally Oppal had said {{a few days earlier}} that the prosecution would likely not appeal. Although Pickton had been acquitted on the first-degree murder charges, he was convicted of second-degree murder and received the same sentence as he would have on first-degree murder convictions. The {{relatives of}} the victims expressed concern that the convictions would be jeopardized if the Crown argued that the trial judge had made errors. Opposition critic Leonard Krog criticized the Attorney-General for not having briefed the victims’ families in advance.|$|E
25|$|Josh and Babe become close friends. On October 31, 2005, Josh tells Babe that he cannot deny it anymore: he {{is falling}} for her, {{and he wants}} her {{to be happy and}} to enjoy her life and not worry about JR or Jamie anymore. During this talk, they share a kiss. Babe is <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> Josh's declaration. Although she is flattered, she tells him she simply is not ready to be in another romantic relationship. Babe later becomes romantically {{involved}} with JR again, however, which later leads to a murder attempt made on her by JR when he has an extreme mental breakdown.|$|E
25|$|To bring Fanny to her senses, Sir Thomas {{sends her}} for a visit to her parents in Portsmouth, hoping that the {{contrast}} will awaken her {{to the value of}} Henry's offer. She sets off with William and sees him in his first berth as a commissioned officer. At Portsmouth, she develops a firm bond with her younger sister, Susan, but is <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the contrast between her dissolute surroundings — noise, chaos, unpalatable food, crude conversation, and filth everywhere — and the harmonious environment at Mansfield. Henry visits her there. Although Fanny still refuses him, her attitude begins to soften, particularly as Edmund and Mary seem to be moving toward an engagement.|$|E
6000|$|A {{short time}} ago, in the evening, in a street of Liverpool, I saw a decent man, {{of the lower}} orders, <b>taken</b> much <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> being roughly brushed against by a rowdy fellow. He looked after him, and exclaimed indignantly, [...] "Is that a Yankee?" [...] It shows the kind of {{character}} we have here.|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked at}} me as if <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> a little <b>by</b> my {{assurance}} and the seemingly transparent candour of my speech, and in his face I saw that he believed me. A moment he hesitated yet; then-- ...|$|R
50|$|Despite Brienne's {{failure to}} secure House Tully's support, the Stark loyalists are {{successful}} in ousting House Bolton, albeit only with {{the intervention of the}} Knights of the Vale and Littlefinger. Bran and Arya Stark, having heard of the Starks' victory, return to Winterfell. Arya spars with Brienne, and <b>takes</b> Brienne <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the ease with which she defeats the older woman.|$|R
25|$|As a child, Steve Jr. {{had heard}} his late father's stories of adventures with Wonder Woman during World War II. It is {{essentially}} confirmed {{in the second}} season première that his father never introduced him to Wonder Woman {{and that he had}} never even seen her photographed. It is similarly implied that he and YN1 Diana Prince were unaware of each other. Diana is <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the younger Steve's existence, implying that his father had never spoken of the boy to either Wonder Woman or YN1 Prince. This was particularly striking when she spoke to Steve Jr. about knowing his father well, from the j-shaped burn scar on his right shoulder, to the 20mm shell casing that he used as a paperweight.|$|E
25|$|Stax {{was located}} in Memphis, Tennessee, which was still a {{segregated}} city, where Martin Luther King, Jr., {{a leader of the}} civil rights movement, was assassinated in 1968. Whilst there was much racism around the artists, the Stax recording studio seemed to be an escape from the turmoil of the real world. When the artists got into the studio, they were there for one reason only, and that was to make hit music, some of which had the social consciousness that became a soundtrack for the civil rights movement. On their 1967 tour in Europe, some of the Stax artists were <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the welcome that they received, enjoying a better reception in parts of Europe than in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Another {{featured}} {{character is}} Erin Silver (who goes by her last name), Kelly Taylor and David Silver's half sister and Naomi's former best friend, until Silver's father's affair is revealed by Naomi, although she eventually reconciles her friendship with Naomi. She quickly befriends Annie and starts dating Dixon, who is somewhat <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> her not-so-90210 lifestyle, {{as she is}} a virgin who doesn't care about popularity. In a multi-episode arc that culminated in a very special episode, it is revealed that Silver has bipolar disorder. Kelly Taylor is now a guidance counselor at West Beverly and has a son named Sammy. Kelly becomes Silver's guardian after their mother proves to be an inadequate caretaker for Silver due to her alcoholism. Kelly briefly dates Ryan, but discovers that he also slept with Brenda, re-creating the rift between the two friends. Following Brenda's discovery that she cannot have children, however, the women are drawn together in an accord once again.|$|E
60|$|At Auchtermuchty and Portsmouth no obstacle, apparently, {{was offered}} to the invaders. At Brighton the enemy were {{permitted}} to land unharmed. Scarborough, <b>taken</b> utterly <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the boyish vigour of the Young Turks, was an easy prey; and at Yarmouth, though the Grand Duke received a nasty {{slap in the face}} from a dexterously-thrown bloater, the resistance appears to have been equally futile.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Truck {{afterwards}} {{affirmed that}} he was [...] "never before <b>taken</b> so flat <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> a question as by this." [...] Still he extricated himself from the dilemma with dexterity, the spirit of proselytism apparently arising within him in proportion as the other manifested indifference to his offices.|$|R
6000|$|If Polly had {{suddenly}} boxed his ears, Tom {{could n't have}} looked more <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> than <b>by</b> that burst. He looked at her excited face, seemed to {{understand the meaning of}} it, and remembered all at once {{that he was trying to}} hide behind a girl. He turned scarlet, said shortly, [...] "Come back, Polly," [...] and walked straight out of the room, looking as if going to instant execution, for poor Tom had been taught to fear his father, and had not entirely outgrown the dread.|$|R
25|$|Nevertheless, Greig helped Packer {{by signing}} {{a number of}} English and foreign players he was acquainted with. Great secrecy cloaked these signings, {{although}} Greig dropped a number of hints to friends not involved. The touring Australians arrived in England and they were scheduled to play Greig's Sussex team on 7–10 May 1977. The match was ruined by poor weather, but at a party held at Greig's house during the match, two Australian journalists discovered the secret signings and the news became public. Although Greig had counted on a backlash, he was <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> {{the severity of the}} condemnation and vitriol that poured in his direction. His central role in the organisation of the breakaway troupe caused much annoyance and surely conflicted with his role as England captain. As the furore continued on, Greig became the focal point for critics, particularly because Packer was still an unknown in Britain. Finally, after a week of politicking, Greig was removed from the England captaincy.|$|E
25|$|The book {{created a}} {{reaction}} in China, sparking follow-up essays by Chinese writers who were <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the Phan's description of Vietnamese life under French colonial rule. It generated gloomy pieces by Chinese writers who predicted that their nation would suffer {{a similar fate}} if they failed to modernize. One such Chinese response later became a teaching text at the Tonkin Free School in Hanoi, a school run by Phan's contemporaries to promote the independence movement. However, Phan did not receive much of a reaction in terms of aid towards his independence efforts, since the book made Chinese readers worry about their own future. The book had a much better reception among Vietnamese readers. Phan and a colleague, Đặng Tử Kính, left Japan {{for the first time}} in August 1905, carrying 50 copies of the book that were to distributed throughout Vietnam, of which further copies were made inside the country. Phan's direct writing style, without the use of allegories, upset traditionalists but made the book more accessible to literate people who had not been trained in classical literature.|$|E
25|$|After several weeks, they {{traveled}} to Amritsar, staying near the Harmandir Sahib and worshipping at a Sikh gurudwara. They also read English- and Sanskrit-language books, exposing Tagore to astronomy, biographies of such figures as Benjamin Franklin, and Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Later, in mid-April, Tagore {{and his father}} set off for the remote and frigid Himalayan hill station of Dalhousie, India, near what is now Himachal Pradesh's border with Kashmir. There, at an elevation of some 2,300meters (7,500feet), {{they lived in a}} house high atop Bakrota hill. Tagore was <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> <b>by</b> the region's deep gorges, alpine forests, and mossy streams and waterfalls. Yet Tagore was also made to study lessons — including such things as Sanskrit declensions — starting in the icy pre-dawn twilight. Tagore took a break from his readings for a noontime meal; thereafter, Tagore was to continue his studies, although he was often allowed to fall asleep. Some two months later, Tagore left his father in Dalhousie and journeyed back to Calcutta.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} answer--I tell you, sir, I could not answer, so <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> was I <b>by</b> the {{assurance}} of the woman. And so, seeming by my silence {{to agree to}} all that she had said, I was dragged away by the butler and the constable into the cellar, in which they locked me for the night.|$|R
5000|$|In the Classic Albums {{documentary}} about the making of A Night at the Opera, Brian May stated that the band was somewhat <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> at first <b>by</b> the bitterness of Mercury's lyrics, and described by Mercury as being [...] "so vindictive that he May felt bad singing it". After the song came together, {{it was agreed that}} the [...] "author should have his way", and the song was recorded as written.|$|R
60|$|Stunned {{and terrified}} though poor Mrs Foster was, as she rushed {{about the room}} in search of water and scent-bottles, she was <b>taken</b> <b>aback</b> {{somewhat}} <b>by</b> the warmth of these expressions, which Bax, in {{the strength of his}} feelings, and the excitement of the moment, uttered quite unconsciously. Guy was utterly confounded, for the truth {{now for the first time}} flashed upon him, and when he beheld his friend tenderly press his lips on the fair forehead of the still insensible Amy, it became clear beyond a doubt. Lucy was also amazed, for although she was aware of Amy's love for Bax, she had never dreamed that it was returned.|$|R
