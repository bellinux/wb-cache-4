5|$|René Wellek (1903–1995) was an Austrian-born scholar {{from the}} structuralist Prague school of linguistics, {{studying}} under Vilém Mathesius. Wellek had training in classical literature and was fluent in several European languages, both Romance and Slavic. His <b>theoretical</b> <b>training</b> included the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl, {{as used in}} Roman Ingarden's work, and the psychologically influenced linguistics of Karl Bühler. After Nazi Germany occupied Prague in 1939, Wellek fled London– {{where he had been}} teaching– for the United States, teaching at the University of Iowa under Norman Foerster.|$|E

Recreational divers are expected not to do decompression dives by most certification organizations, though CMAS and BSAC allow for short decompression dives in some levels of recreational divers. Technical, commercial, military and scientific divers may all be expected to do decompression dives in {{the normal course of}} their sport or occupation, and are specifically trained in appropriate procedures and equipment relevant to their level of certification. A significant part of practical and <b>theoretical</b> <b>training</b> for these divers is on the {{practice of}} safe and effective decompression procedures and the selection and use of the appropriate equipment.|$|E

25|$|The {{motorcycles}} {{are divided}} in three categories. Anyone born before 1985 may drive a moped. Persons born in 1985 or after may obtain a moped driver's licence {{at the age}} of 15. This requires training in a driving school or by your relative. After that there's a theoretical test and short handling test. The A1 licence, allowing the use of light motorbikes, may be obtained {{at the age of}} 16. The practical training is done independently in traffic after a training permit has been obtained from the police. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>training</b> includes 12 theory lessons. A person who has A1 licence can get an A2 after holding the A1 for two years by completing an additional training course in a driving school. After two years of A2 licence, it can be turned into full A licence with extra training in a driving school. After the age of 24, a person can obtain the A licence directly, without holding an A1 licence first.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{graduating from}} Gymnasium (high school) in 1935, Wick, who {{initially}} considered {{a career as}} a forester, applied to the officer candidate course of the new German Air Force. Scoring well on the suitability tests, he was accepted into the German military on 6 April 1936 at the Luftwaffe officer candidate school in Dresden, after completing compulsory Reichsarbeitsdienst (Reich Labour Service). He swore the oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler on 16 April. After passing officer training courses, Wick was assessed as [...] "well suited to become an officer" [...] on 13 July. He then started flight training and shortly later soloed in a Focke-Wulf Fw 44 [...] "Stieglitz". Wick was considered an average pilot and had difficulties with his <b>theoretical</b> <b>training,</b> especially those topics that were of little or no interest to him. In early May 1937, he was briefly transferred to the 6. Staffel (6th squadron) of Kampfgeschwader 254 (254th Bomber Wing). A month later he returned to Dresden to complete his officer training.|$|E

In the 1920s, schools of photographic realism were popping up throughout Europe but {{each had a}} different view on the direction photography should take. [...] The Surrealist movement, founded in 1924, was a catalyst for this paradigm shift. Cartier-Bresson began socializing with the Surrealists at the Café Cyrano, in the Place Blanche. He met {{a number of the}} movement's leading protagonists, and was drawn to the Surrealist movement's technique of using the subconscious and the immediate to influence their work.
