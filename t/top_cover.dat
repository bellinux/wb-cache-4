5|$|On 7 September 1940, No. 605 {{moved on}} {{rotation}} to Croydon Aerodrome {{under the command}} of Squadron Leader Walter Churchill. McKellar scored a further four victories in a single mission on 9 September. McKellar attacked with the sun at his back with his Squadron, save for one Section which was left to provide <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> against Bf 109s. The attack was made head-on to break up the German bomber formation which consisted of a large mass of He 111s. He destroyed three He 111s with a single, 12–second burst. The first He 111 exploded. It damaged a second which rolled over and dived down into the ground. McKellar then moved his fire to a third. Its port wing snapped off. He then destroyed a Bf 109 in the afternoon giving him a fourth success.|$|E

5|$|Pottery steamer: Archaeological {{excavations}} {{show that}} using steam to cook {{began with the}} pottery cooking vessels known as yan steamers; a yan composed of two vessel, a zeng with perforated floor surmounted on a pot or caldron with a tripod base and a <b>top</b> <b>cover.</b> The earliest yan steamer dating from about 5000 BC was unearthed in the Banpo site. In the lower Yangzi River, zeng pots {{first appeared in the}} Hemudu culture (5000–4500 BC) and Liangzhu culture (3200–2000 BC) and used to steam rice; there are also yan steamers unearthed in several Liangzhu sites, including 3 found at the Chuodun and Luodun sites in southern Jiangsu. In the Longshan culture (3000–2000 BC) site at Tianwang in western Shandong, 3 large yan steamers were discovered.|$|E
5|$|The German fighter escort {{consisted}} of five Gruppen from JG 3, JG 53 and Jagdgeschwader 77 (JG 77). LG 2 Bf 109s flew <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> while Adolf Galland's JG 26 and Jagdgeschwader 51 (JG 51) conducted fighter sweeps {{in advance of}} the main bomber stream. For the sake of appearances (the morale of the bomber crews), Zerstörergeschwader 26 (Destroyer Wing 26 or ZG 26) flying the Messerschmitt Bf 110 flew close escort to KG 26. It was twice as small as the formation that hit London on 7 September, but instead of having two fighters for every bomber, there were four. Nor could the German pilots complain about being tied to the bombers. Sufficient numbers of fighters were allowed to roam on free-ranging patrols.|$|E
5|$|While {{they fell}} away seriously shot about, {{and the rest}} of 60 Squadron exited the scene, Voss was engaged by B Flight, 56 Squadron, in their SE.5as. Captain James McCudden and his wingmen {{attacked}} in pairs from 300meters (1,000feet) above Voss. In a pincer movement, McCudden hooked into an assault from the right while his wingman, Lieutenant Arthur Rhys Davids, swooped in from the left. Muspratt trailed them down, while Cronyn brought up the rear. Jeffs and Young held high as <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> in case Voss climbed. He was now boxed in from above and below, with assailants pouncing from either side. To further worsen Voss's situation, there was a British fighter patrol beneath him.|$|E

5|$|Lützow {{was posted}} {{missing in action}} {{following}} combat on 24 April 1945 while attempting to intercept an attack by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers near Donauwörth. According to Stockert, an examination of U.S. records by Mr. Hirst indicates that Lützow's Me262 crashed near Schrobenhausen. The USAAF flew three attacks against the oil terminals at Schrobenhausen, south of Neuburg an der Donau, that day. On their second mission, 22 B-26 bombers escorted by 16 Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft, were just beginning their bomb run at 3:25pm, when they came under attack by four Me262s. Two P-47s came diving down from their <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> position {{to fend off the}} attacking jets. In this account, one Me262 pilot noticed {{that he was about to}} come under attack and attempted to dive away. Unable to recover from this dive, the American pilots observed the Me262 crashing into a small hill. This Me262 may have been piloted by Lützow.|$|E
5|$|No. 151's Pilot Officer Richard Milne {{shot down}} Gruppenkommandeur of II./KG 53, Major Reinhold Tamm. The He 111 blew up, killing all aboard. The escorting Bf 109s counter-attacked, {{shooting}} down two No. 151 Squadron Hurricanes, killing one pilot and wounding the other. No. 257 Squadron also engaged and lost one pilot {{killed in a}} crash landing after combat with Bf 110s. No. 46 Squadron—the only 12 Group unit to take part—also engaged. Shortly hence, the 13 Hurricanes from No. 85 Squadron, led by Peter Townsend, struck at the bombers but was blocked by ZG 26 Bf 110s. Bf 109s was also present and inconclusive engagements began. It was likely the Bf 109s belonged to III./JG 51 providing <b>top</b> <b>cover.</b> There was intense combat around the bombers. No. 1 Squadron's leader, David Pemperton, accounted for one JG 3 Bf 109. No. 85 Squadron accounted for one He 111, but lost a Hurricane to the Bf 110s, the pilot, Pilot Officer Paddy Hemmingway, bailed out into the Channel and survived. Another pilot, Flight Lieutenant Dick Lee, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of France and a flying ace with nine victories was reported missing in action. He was last seen chasing three Bf 109s out to sea. His body was never found. Among the few British squadrons left in the fight (owing to fuel and ammunition running low) was No. 54 Squadron. Its commander, Colin Falkland Gray, destroyed a Bf 110.|$|E
25|$|It {{operated}} as an {{open top}} unvestibuled tram until 1928, when a <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> was fitted. A {{transfer to the}} Engineering Department in 1934 saw the tram renumbered 4 and modified for engineering use - the <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> being removed and replaced with a central wire inspection tower with current collection poles front and rear, and driver's windscreens fitted. In the Blackpool fleet renumbering of the 1960s, it was renumbered 754.|$|E

25|$|USAAF escort {{fighters were}} {{increasingly}} effective. On 11 September 1944 II. (Sturm)/JG 300 lost 13 Fw 190s to P-51 Mustangs, with 10 pilots killed and two wounded. They claimed nine Mustangs, actual Mustang losses {{was just one}} 339th Fighter Group P-51, damaged by Flak and shot down by an Me 262.

50|$|In July 1928, {{an evening}} postal {{collection}} was instituted on the 8.30pm tram from River. In December 1928, two secondhand trams were purchased from the Birmingham and Midland Joint Committee, with three <b>top</b> <b>covers</b> {{at a total}} cost of £450. The new trams took numbers 11 and 12 and the <b>top</b> <b>covers</b> were fitted to trams 25 - 27. Trams 22 - 24 were withdrawn from traffic so that their bodies could be rebuilt. The introduction of the new cars meant that some alterations {{had to be made}} to the overhead wiring and support poles.|$|R
25|$|A variant {{known as}} the Bizon-3 was also developed, and {{features}} a flip-up rear peep sight moved further to the rear on the receiver cover and a stock that folds {{up and over the}} receiver to lock into a spring-loaded latch on the receiver <b>top</b> <b>cover.</b> The weapon's barrel has an adapter for several types of muzzle devices. These are selected by the operator depending on the weapon's tactical employment and include sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, compensators and flash hiders.|$|E

25|$|On 11 December, India airdropped the 2 Parachute Battalion Group in the {{now famous}} Tangail airdrop. The {{operation}} involved An-12s, C-119s, 2 Caribous and Dakotas from various squadrons. In total, about 700 troops were airdropped. The only hitch was one paratrooper, Hav Mahadeo, who had a static line hangup. Gnats from No. 22 Squadron provided <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> for the operation, which ultimately went unhindered. Also, on 11 December, three converted An-12s from the No. 44 Squadron struck the Jaydebpur Ordnance factory in East Pakistan.|$|E

25|$|The first daytime raids in East Pakistan {{were flown}} by Hunters of No. 17 Squadron, {{and these were}} given <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> by four MiG-21s from No.28 Squadron. It proved unnecessary, and the Hunters shot down one Sabre when intercepted before the {{rendezvous}} took place. No. 14 Squadron also struck Kurmitola AFB, hitting the hangars and installations with rockets. By the afternoon, Hunters would strike Narayangunj fuel depots, and would hit Chittagong Harbour {{on the morning of}} 4 December. In an afternoon strike on Tejgaon by MiGs from 28 Squadron, a Twin otter was destroyed on the ground.|$|E
25|$|The steam tram {{achieved}} {{only limited}} success and cut just 10 {{minutes from the}} 1-hour 10-minute horse-drawn journey from Basford to Nottingham. The report of 1885 in The Railway & Tramway Express reported that the steam tram gave unsatisfactory performance and had more holidays allotted to it than the horses. With running costs of around 6d per mile, each return trip from Basford to Nottingham would have cost the company around 2s 9d. In 1889, it lost its licence and was withdrawn, the 1885 passenger tram car being rebuilt into a horse-drawn, four-wheeled vehicle, being shortened and having its <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> removed. This car {{spent the rest of}} its days on the Trent Bridge service.|$|E
25|$|Allied pilots {{soon found}} that the only {{reliable}} way to destroy the jets, as with the even faster Me 163 Komet rocket fighters, was to attack {{them on the ground}} or during takeoff or landing. Luftwaffe airfields identified as jet bases were frequently bombed by medium bombers, and Allied fighters patrolled over the fields to attack jets trying to land. The Luftwaffe countered by installing extensive flak alleys of anti-aircraft guns along the approach lines to protect the Me 262s from the ground—and by providing <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> during the jets' takeoff and landing with the most advanced Luftwaffe single-engined fighters, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190D and (just becoming available in 1945) Focke-Wulf Ta 152H. Nevertheless, in March–April 1945, Allied fighter patrol patterns over Me 262 airfields resulted in numerous jet losses.|$|E
