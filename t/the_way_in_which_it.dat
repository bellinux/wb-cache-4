5|$|Ability {{of judges}} to balance {{competing}} policy considerations. Where the decision requires the intricate balancing of various competing policy considerations, judges may be ill-equipped to decide {{because of their}} limited training, experience and access to materials. Thus, the courts should avoid reviewing the merits of such executive decisions. This was mentioned in GCHQ where Lord Diplock held {{that the type of}} evidence admissible in the judicial process and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> is adduced tends to exclude from the attention of the court competing policy considerations which need to be weighed against one another.|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{correctly}} {{identifies the}} origin of amber as the fossilised resin of pine trees. Evidence cited includes {{the fact that some}} samples exhibit encapsulated insects, a feature readily explained by the presence of a viscous resin. Pliny refers to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> exerts a charge when rubbed, a property well known to Theophrastus. He devotes considerable space to bees, which he admires for their industry, organisation, and honey, discussing the significance of the queen bee and the use of smoke by beekeepers at the hive to collect honeycomb. He praises the song of the nightingale.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the film had been growing since Noé's adolescence, when he first became {{interested}} in matters of death and existence. In his early twenties—while under influence of psilocybin mushrooms—he saw Robert Montgomery's Lady in the Lake, a 1947 film shot entirely in a first-person perspective. He then decided that, if he ever made a film about the afterlife, that was <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> would be filmed. Noé {{had been working on}} different versions of the screenplay for fifteen years before the film went into production. The story had initially been more linear, and the drafts were set in different locations, including the Andes, France, and New York City. Tokyo was chosen because it could provide colourful environments required for the film's hallucinogenic aspects, and because Japan's repressive drug laws add to the drama, explaining the intensity of the main character's fear of the police.|$|E

Admittedly, it started very well, as Streak got Vincent out with the third delivery of the match. Ireland continued his happy knack of getting wickets, getting the opposing skipper Stephen Fleming for 23 and Hamish Marshall for 7, as New Zealand struggled to 67 for 4.|$|E

25|$|In later years, this {{oversight}} role was vested in the Native Land Court under the Native Land Court Act of 1862, and later renamed the Māori Land Court. It was through this court that much Māori land was alienated, and <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> functioned is much criticised today. Over the longer term, the land purchase {{aspect of the}} Treaty declined in importance, while the clauses of the Treaty which deal with sovereignty and Māori rights took on greater importance.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the object can be {{increased}} by <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> is given and several authors have pointed {{to the fact that}} organs given in altruistic manner acquire greater social worth. Organs given in altruistic manner are thought to say something about the moral character of the people who give them. Furthermore, the giving of organs without any form of compensation erases the possibility that the giver will have any form of vested interest in the transaction.|$|E
25|$|The trifolium villa, {{named after}} a clover-shaped room that was without a doubt used as a triclinium, is the largest private house {{excavated}} so far at Dougga. The house had two storeys, but there is almost nothing left of the upper storey. It stands {{in the south of}} the city, halfway up the hill. The house is particularly interesting because of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> is built to align with the lay of the land; the entrance hall slopes down to a courtyard around which the various rooms were arranged.|$|E

25|$|Sticking one's {{tongue out}} at someone is {{considered}} a childish gesture of rudeness and/or defiance in many countries; the act may also have sexual connotations, depending on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> is done. However, in Tibet it {{is considered a}} greeting. In 2009, a farmer from Fabriano, Italy was convicted and fined by the country's highest court for sticking his tongue out at a neighbor {{with whom he had}} been arguing. Proof of the affront had been captured with a cell phone camera. Blowing a raspberry can also be meant as a gesture of derision.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the strongest}} criticisms of the World Bank has been <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> is governed. While the World Bank {{represents}} 188 countries, it {{is run by a}} small number of economically powerful countries. These countries (which also provide most of the institution's funding) choose the leadership and senior management of the World Bank, and their interests dominate the bank. Titus Alexander argues that the unequal voting power of western countries and the World Bank's role in developing countries makes it similar to the South African Development Bank under apartheid, and therefore a pillar of global apartheid.|$|E

The trial {{has been noted}} by the press in the north, and the {{reaction}} is strongly disapproving of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was conducted, but the African-American domestics wonder if the reaction would have been as strong if the victim had been black ("A Rumblin' and a Rollin'"). Lucille tries to help Leo with his appeal, but reveals crucial information to Craig, provoking a fight between Leo and Lucille ("Do it Alone"). Lucille then finds Governor Slaton at a party ("Pretty Music") and attempts to advocate for Leo. She accuses him of either being a fool or a coward if he accepts {{the outcome of the}} trial as is. Meanwhile, Tom Watson approaches Hugh Dorsey and tells him that he will support his bid for governor should he choose to make it.|$|E

25|$|One {{characteristic}} of postmodern art is its conflation {{of high and}} low culture through the use of industrial materials and pop culture imagery. The use of low forms of art were a part of modernist experimentation as well, as documented in Kirk Varnedoe and Adam Gopnik's 1990–91 show High and Low: Popular Culture and Modern Art at New York's Museum of Modern Art, an exhibition that was universally panned at the time as the only event that could bring Douglas Crimp and Hilton Kramer together in a chorus of scorn. Postmodern art is noted for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> blurs the distinctions between what is perceived as fine or high art and what is generally seen as low or kitsch art. Whilst this concept of 'blurring' or 'fusing' high art with low art had been experimented during modernism, it only ever became fully endorsed after the advent of the postmodern era. Postmodernism introduced elements of commercialism, kitsch and a general camp aesthetic within its artistic context; postmodernism takes styles from past periods, such as Gothicism, the Renaissance and the Baroque, and mixes them so as to ignore their original use in their corresponding artistic movement. Such elements are common characteristics of what defines postmodern art.|$|E

500|$|The {{association}} {{of women with}} the typewriter {{may be linked to}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was marketed. Before the typewriter was acquired by Remington, Sholes' daughter was employed to demonstrate the device and to appear in promotional images, which served as the basis for early advertisements. Remington's sales agents later marketed the machine with tactics including the use of attractive women to demonstrate the device at trade shows and in hotel lobbies. Depictions of female operators suggested the device was [...] "easy enough for a woman" [...] and suited for domestic use. Although also designed to allow Remington to maintain manufacturing efficiencies with its sewing machine division, the typewriter's aesthetics (the sewing machine stand and floral ornamentation) were further intended to facilitate its acceptance into the household.|$|E
500|$|Black is {{the color}} of power, ambition, death, illness, corruption, selfishness, amorality, and sacrifice. It is not {{necessarily}} evil, though many of its cards refer directly or indirectly to this concept. Black's strengths include the ability to destroy creatures instantly; forcing players to discard cards from their hand; decreasing a player's life while you usually gain that same amount lost; evasive abilities are common among Black creatures; and resurrecting creatures from a player's graveyard. Furthermore, because Black seeks to win at all costs, it has limited access to many abilities or effects that are normally available only to one of the other colors; but these abilities often require large sacrifices of life totals, creatures, cards in hand, cards in library, and other difficult-to-replace resources. One of the most notable abilities among Black creatures is [...] "", which always causes creatures damaged by those possessing this ability to be sent to the graveyard, regardless of the damage amount assigned. Black's main weaknesses include an almost complete inability to deal with enchantments and artifacts; the tendency to inflict itself with severe negative effects in order to defeat the opponent; <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> overly relies on cards inside the graveyards; and difficulties in removing other Black creatures.|$|E
500|$|J. Hoberman of The Village Voice {{said the}} film was a [...] "gripping" [...] account that did [...] "an {{excellent}} job in deconstructing the Venezuelan TV news footage of blood, chaos, and rival crowds", {{and said it was}} [...] "nearly a textbook on media manipulation". Writing for The New York Times, Stephen Holden said {{the film was}} [...] "a riveting documentary" [...] that delivered [...] "the suspense of a smaller-scale Seven Days in May", citing <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> examined how television can be used to [...] "deceive and manipulate the public". He reproached the film's uncritical depiction of Chávez, and how it hinted at CIA involvement without presenting any proof. Ty Burr in The Boston Globe called the film [...] "our best chance" [...] to find out what really happened on 11–13April, but cautioned that the filmmakers' [...] "pro-Chávez stance" [...] meant that for wider context audiences should look elsewhere, as it left out too much of Chávez's record. Burr also said the film's attempt to make the US into a villain was ineffective. He said, [...] "because [...] view the chasm that divides Venezuela purely {{in the context of the}} Cold War and Latin American political instability, they downplay the class warfare that's exploding right in front of them." [...] Nevertheless, Burr concluded that the film's narrow focus remained engrossing.|$|E
