2500|$|By 1954, when Brown {{came up for}} decision, it {{had been}} {{apparent}} {{for some time that}} segregation rarely if ever produced equality. Quite aside from any question of psychology, <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>facilities</b> provided for blacks were not as good as those provided for whites. That had been demonstrated in a long series of cases [...] [...] [...] The Court's realistic choice, therefore, was either to abandon the quest for equality by allowing segregation or to forbid segregation in order to achieve equality. There was no third choice. Either choice would violate one aspect of the original understanding, but there was no possibility of avoiding that. Since equality and segregation were mutually inconsistent, though the ratifiers did not understand that, both could not be honored. When that is seen, it is obvious the Court must choose equality and prohibit state-imposed segregation. The purpose that brought the fourteenth amendment into being was equality before the law, and equality, not separation, was written into the law.|$|E

40|$|It can {{be argued}} that {{customer}} satisfaction is at the centre of the marketing concept, and strategic planning of <b>physical</b> <b>facilities</b> has been found to influence consumer satisfaction. Considering the spectator sport industry has experienced a tremendous boom in the building of facilities, {{a better understanding of how}} facilities influence customers is warranted. A sample of 218 minor league ice hockey spectators was used to investigate the influence of individual <b>physical</b> <b>facility</b> elements on customer satisfaction, and to investigate the influence of <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>facility</b> relative to other targets of quality, namely the core product and service personnel. Multiple regression analysis revealed that facility elements together predicted customer satisfaction (R 2 = 0. 183, adjusted R 2 = 0. 162), but that the attributes of the facility had little impact individually. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that both perceptions of service personnel and of <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>facility</b> contributed to customer satisfaction over and above the impact of customers' perceptions of the core product. Based on these results, it is argued that managers must address <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>facility</b> in combination with other targets of quality to improve spectators' levels of customer satisfaction. ...|$|R
