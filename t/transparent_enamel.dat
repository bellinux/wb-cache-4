500|$|There {{are only}} four other known survivals, secular or religious, of basse taille enamel on gold, one the small Salting Reliquary, {{also in the}} British Museum, and none as fine as the cup. The [...] "King John Cup" [...] in King's Lynn, of ca. 1340, silver-gilt with <b>transparent</b> <b>enamel,</b> is {{the best example of}} basse-taille work {{probably}} made in England; the metalwork expert Herbert Maryon describes this and the Royal Gold Cup as the [...] "two examples of outstanding merit, unsurpassed in any collection." [...] However it is unclear if most of the enamel at King's Lynn is original. The closest comparison to the Royal Gold Cup is perhaps the silver-gilt Mérode Cup of about 1400, which is the only surviving medieval example of plique á jour enamel, a difficult technique which creates a see-through effect like stained glass. A silver-gilt cup in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam of before 1376 has no enamels or gems, and a different shape, but offers an interesting comparison as it has a tripod stand with winged grotesques as legs, a short stem, and the cover has both an elaborate finial and a raised decorated strip around the rim, so that all the altered aspects of the Royal Gold Cup are present.|$|E
50|$|The term is also {{applied to}} {{monochrome}} painting in enamels. This technique uses {{a buildup of}} white enamel to create highlights and light areas. However, instead of using a black background, as in grisaille, <b>transparent</b> <b>enamel</b> is laid in first, beneath the whites. This technique is frequently used on snuffboxes, watches and medallions.|$|E
5000|$|Marny {{exhibited}} at the Royal Academy. In 1874 the British Journal of Photography reported that'A Gallic brother, M. Paul Marny Godard, of Paris, has obtained a patent {{for the application of}} carbon printing to porcelain or other similar substance, which, after the picture is developed, receives a coating of <b>transparent</b> <b>enamel</b> ...". He died in Scarborough.|$|E
5000|$|Basse-taille, {{from the}} French word meaning [...] "low-cut". The {{surface of the}} metal is {{decorated}} with a low relief design which can be seen through translucent and <b>transparent</b> <b>enamels.</b> The 14th century Royal Gold Cup is an outstanding example.|$|R
5000|$|Lewis’ PWF method also {{pioneered the}} {{enameling}} of lightweight iron filigree beads. The PWF immersion method allows for artistic variations using multiple combinations of opaque and <b>transparent</b> <b>enamels</b> or reducing the oxygen to create smoky hazes. These variations and other {{applications of the}} PWF method are discussed in a [...] "ning" [...] network. The PWF immersion method {{is the subject of}} Torch Fired Enamel Jewelry - A Workshop in Painting with Fire.|$|R
5000|$|The NSC is a four-stepped {{sterling}} silver cross ensigned with the Crown of St Edward. The obverse bears a <b>transparent</b> red <b>enamel</b> cross insert overlaid on a flecked pattern radiating from {{the centre of}} the medal.|$|R
50|$|Other kiln and torch firing {{processes}} for producing enamel jewelry have typically {{been limited to}} pure copper or expensive fine silver. These other methods {{can be used to}} enamel sterling silver, but only after completing the laborious process of depletion gilding. With the PWF method, if using transparent enamels in cool colors (blue or green), there is no requirement to heat and dip the oxidized silver into pickling acid. The immersion method involves the same three-times heating and immersion of the sterling piece, attached to the stainless steel mandrel, and coating with <b>transparent</b> <b>enamel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Clover Leaf Egg {{is made of}} an {{openwork}} {{pattern of}} stems and leaves of clover forming {{the shape of an}} egg. The gaps between the metal outline of the leaves are covered with transparent bright green enamel. A very thin golden ribbon paved with rubies curls through the foliage. At the time, the production of <b>transparent</b> <b>enamel</b> was still a new method, and often suffered from problems while cooling. There are no flaws in the enamel of the Clover Leaf Egg, but it is considered too fragile to travel.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} {{then spread}} to other centres for high-quality courtly work, {{at a time when}} the champlevé enamels associated above all with Limoges had become almost mass-produced and relatively cheap. It is generally agreed that the late 14th century Royal Gold Cup, now in the British Museum, is the outstanding surviving example of basse taille enamel. [...] It is one of only four known survivals done on gold, including both secular or religious pieces; another is the small Salting Reliquary, also in the British Museum. [...] The [...] "King John Cup" [...] in King's Lynn, of ca. 1340, silver-gilt with <b>transparent</b> <b>enamel,</b> is the best example of basse-taille work probably made in England; the metalwork expert Herbert Maryon describes this and the Royal Gold Cup as the [...] "two examples of outstanding merit, unsurpassed in any collection". [...] However it is unclear if most of the enamel at King's Lynn is original.|$|E

5000|$|Plique-à-jour, French for [...] "open to daylight" [...] {{where the}} enamel is applied in cells, similar to cloisonné, {{but with no}} backing, so light can shine through the <b>transparent</b> or {{translucent}} <b>enamel.</b> It has a stained-glass like appearance; the Mérode Cup is the surviving medieval example.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{admission}} {{into the}} Alberta Order of Excellence, {{in a ceremony}} held at Government House in Edmonton, members are presented with the order's insignia. According to Insignia Regulation, which stipulates {{the design of the}} order's badges and ribbon and how they are worn, the main emblem of the order is a 51 mm wide gold medallion {{in the form of a}} cross pattée, with the equidistant arms consisting of a <b>transparent</b> blue <b>enamel</b> over gold patterned to resemble prairie wheat. This cross is layered between a burnished gold disk bearing roses and rose leaves, and another roundel with the coat of arms of Alberta on a red enamel background, surrounded by a white circle bearing the words The Alberta Order of Excellence. On the reverse is a maple leaf supported by a sheaf of wheat. The ribbon is patterned with vertical stripes in blue, burgundy, white, and gold, reflecting the colours within the provincial coat of arms; men wear the medallion suspended from this ribbon at the collar, while women carry theirs on a ribbon bow at the left chest. Members will also receive for wear on casual clothing a lapel pin.|$|R

5000|$|Plique-à-jour (French for [...] "letting in daylight") is a {{vitreous}} enamelling technique {{where the}} enamel is applied in cells, similar to cloisonné, {{but with no}} backing in the final product, so light can shine through the <b>transparent</b> or translucent <b>enamel.</b> It is in effect a miniature version of stained-glass and is considered very challenging technically: high time consumption (up to 4 months per item), with a high failure rate. The technique {{is similar to that}} of cloisonné, but using a temporary backing that after firing is dissolved by acid or rubbed away. A different technique relies solely on surface tension, for smaller areas. In Japan the technique is known as shotai-jippo (shotai shippo), and is found from the 19th century on.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This {{study used}} three lasers (red, green and blue) with a {{spectrophotometer}} {{to compare the}} light propagation [Absorption (A), Transmittance (T), Attenuation (K) and Scattering Anisotropy Coefficient (g) ] in dental tissues and nano filled resin based composite using three incremental build-up techniques: one shade (Body), two shades (Enamel and Dentin), and three shades (<b>Enamel,</b> <b>Transparent</b> and Dentin). Methods: Twenty un-erupted recently extracted human 3 rd molars (shade: B 1) were used to obtain 40 tooth slabs (1. 5 mm thickness x 4 mm length). The samples were randomized and equally distributed into four experimental groups: Positive Control (Dental Tissues – enamel, dentino- enamel-junction and dentin), Technique 1 (T 1 = 1 shade, B 1 B), Technique 2 (T 2 = 2 shades, A 2 Dentin/B 1 Enamel), and Technique 3 (T 3 = 3 shades, A 2 Dentin/Transparent/B 1 Enamel). One calibrated operator performed all procedures and tests. Cavity preparation was standardized using a # 58 carbide bur. Using the spectrophotometer, each specimen was irradiated by the three LASERs. A Voltmeter recorded the light output signal and from this raw data the following optical constants were calculated: absorption (A), transmittance (T), attenuation coefficient (K) and Scattering Anisotropy Coefficient (g). The {{data were analyzed using}} One-way ANOVA, followed by the post-hoc Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s test. All tests utilized a significance level of 0. 05. Results: Regarding absorption and transmittance, dental tissues were significantly different compared to the three build-up techniques for all lasers. Regarding the attenuation coefficient, dental tissues were not significantly different for T 2 and T 3 for the blue and red lasers, however they were significantly different for the green laser. There was no significant difference among the three lasers for T 2 and T 3. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, none of the build-up techniques used was able to reproduce the dental tissues optical properties and Technique 2 (2 shades) and Technique 3 (3 shades) resulted in a similar pattern of light propagation...|$|R
