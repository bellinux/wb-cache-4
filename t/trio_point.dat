2500|$|The [...] "Sleepy Floyd game" [...] was a {{catalyst}} for increased interest in the NBA in the Bay Area which was furthered by new coach Don Nelson, who engineered another successful string of wins in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the high-scoring <b>trio</b> of <b>point</b> guard Tim Hardaway, guard Mitch Richmond and forward Chris Mullin (collectively known as [...] "Run TMC" [...] after the rap group Run-D.M.C.). But [...] "Run TMC" [...] stayed together for only two seasons (winning only one playoff series), when coach Nelson, in a move to get a promising young front-court player to complement his run-and-gun system, sent Richmond to the Sacramento Kings for rookie power forward Billy Owens. Nelson {{had been brought to}} the Warriors from the Milwaukee Bucks by Jim Fitzgerald, who along with Dan Finnane owned the team between 1986 and 1995. In 1993–94, with first-round draft pick and Rookie of the Year power forward Chris Webber playing alongside off-guard Latrell Sprewell, the Warriors made the playoffs.|$|R
50|$|The 1981-82 season saw the {{introduction}} of three points for a win and Stoke got their first <b>trio</b> of <b>points</b> on {{the opening day of}} the season away at Arsenal. This was followed by a 4-0 win at home against Coventry City. However results and performances declined and after picking up just four more wins by January Stoke found themselves in a fight against relegation. Youth team product Adrian Heath was fast becoming one of the most talked about midfielders in the division and so Barker allowed him to join Everton for a healthy £700,000. He brought in England international David Watson from Southampton for £50,000 to replace the ageing Denis Smith and Sammy McIlroy for £350,000. Mike Doyle left soon after Watson's arrival following an argument with Barker. Despite an upturn in the results in February Stoke managed just a point in their next nine matches. With Stoke looking destined for relegation McIlroy proved to be a calming influence and Stoke managed to survive by two points.|$|R
50|$|On March 27, Wade, James, and Bosh {{became the}} second trio in NBA history {{to have at}} least 30 points and 10 rebounds in the same non-overtime game (a home win against the Houston Rockets), {{matching}} Oscar Robertson, Wayne Embry and Jack Twyman for the Cincinnati Royals in a loss to the Philadelphia Warriors on February 2, 1961. Additionally, {{it was the first time}} that a team's <b>trio</b> recorded 20 <b>points</b> and 10 rebounds in consecutive games since Sidney Wicks, Lloyd Neal and John Johnson accomplished the feat with the Portland Trail Blazers in March 1975. It was also the first time in Heat franchise history that three players scored 30 points in the same game.|$|R
40|$|Regulator of G-protein signaling" (RGS) {{proteins}} {{facilitate the}} termination of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling via their ability to increase the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of Galpha subunits (known as GTPase-accelerating protein or "GAP" activity). RGS 2 is unique in its in vitro potency and selectivity as a GAP for Galpha(q) subunits. As many vasoconstrictive hormones signal via G(q) heterotrimer-coupled receptors, it is perhaps not surprising that RGS 2 -deficient mice exhibit constitutive hypertension. However, to date the particular structural features within RGS 2 determining its selectivity for Galpha(q) over Galpha(i/o) substrates have not been completely characterized. Here, we examine a <b>trio</b> of <b>point</b> mutations to RGS 2 that elicits Galpha(i) -directed binding and GAP activities without perturbing its association with Galpha(q). Using x-ray crystallography, we determined {{a model of the}} triple mutant RGS 2 in complex with a transition state mimetic form of Galpha(i) at 2. 8 -A resolution. Structural comparison with unliganded, wild type RGS 2 and of other RGS domain/Galpha complexes highlighted the roles of these residues in wild type RGS 2 that weaken Galpha(i) subunit association. Moreover, these three amino acids are seen to be evolutionarily conserved among organisms with modern cardiovascular systems, suggesting that RGS 2 arose from the R 4 -subfamily of RGS proteins to have specialized activity as a potent and selective Galpha(q) GAP that modulates cardiovascular function...|$|R
5000|$|The evening {{started with}} a high-energy group number from the Argentinian trio [...] "Los Huincas Gauchos." [...] Their routine mixed weaponry, drum playing, and hand clapping, but was {{relatively}} low on dance steps. The Argentinian judge, Maria Pogee, remarked that the group [...] "didn't do everything they were supposed to." [...] The <b>trio</b> received 48 <b>points,</b> the lowest score of the competition to that point. India's second soloist, Mythili Prakash, went next, performing a traditional South Indian routine. Her performance earned 58 points. Indian coach Nakul Dev Mahajan is baffled by the score, saying Prakash [...] "sets the standard" [...] for her style of dance". South African judge Harold Van Buuren replies that [...] "there is always room for improvement." [...] Next, Irish step-dancer Kelly Hendry performed a traditional dance {{with a bit of}} a contemporary twist. The judges gave her 56 points.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Thom Jurek says [...] "At the Crossroads {{delivers}} what its title promises: {{a portrait of}} the Organ <b>Trio</b> at the <b>point</b> where they look back at B-3 jazz history and move it ever forward". In JazzTimes Steve Greenlee said [...] "Carter’s tone—alternately gruff and sensuous, always balancing melody and skronk—of course gets the limelight. His is, after all, one of today’s most unmistakable saxophone voices, and he knows it". On All About Jazz C. Michael Bailey noted [...] "Carter takes advantage of the music, exploring all of its facets in his exceptional organ trio format. No stone is left unturned, no influence unaknowledged". The Guardian critic John Fordham wrote [...] "Carter can be sumptuously romantic or exhilaratingly funky - his technique embraces all kinds of extreme playing, from split-note multiphonic harmonies to staccato effects - and he directs his full firepower at this mostly mainstream-groovy repertoire".|$|R

5000|$|After a subpar {{stretch in}} the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team had a brief {{resurgence}} with coach Karl, culminating in a famous 1987 Western Conference Semifinal match against Magic Johnson's Lakers, which is still shown on TV in the NBA's Greatest Games series. In the game, the Warrior's NBA All-Star point guard Sleepy Floyd had an amazing performance in the second half, which is still the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in a half (39). Floyd scored 12 consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter, finishing the game with 51 points, and leading the Warriors to victory. The [...] "Sleepy Floyd Game" [...] was a catalyst for increased interest in the NBA in the Bay Area, which was furthered by new coach Don Nelson who engineered another successful string of wins {{in the late}} 1980s to early 1990s with the high scoring <b>trio</b> of <b>point</b> guard Tim Hardaway, guard Mitch Richmond, and forward Chris Mullin (collectively known as [...] "Run TMC" [...] after the rap group Run-D.M.C.). However, coach Don Nelson wishing to get frontcourt players to complement his run-and-gun system, made a trade that broke up the Run TMC core by sending Richmond to the Sacramento Kings for Billy Owens while bypassing Dikembe Mutombo, who was selected next by the Denver Nuggets.

She sees the three missing students in a room being scourged by Belonia and once she is gone, Joy frees the <b>trio.</b> At this <b>point,</b> {{it was revealed that}} Sister Belonia tortures students either for being disobedient or small mistakes. Crisel, Sabel, and Adela, in retaliation, wrote a letter to their headmistress nun, Mother Agnes, for Belonia's actions. Mother Agnes, upon learning this, reprimands Sis. Belonia for her brutal and torturous manners of disciplining the three girls and her class. When the day for the class picture arrived, the headmistress realizes that their class have the said three girls missing. She then suspends Belonia from San Selino (this later explains why she utters the words often) and tells her that she cannot come back until the three students are found. In return, she committed suicide but not before swearing that she will complete her class' picture, (which explains her vengeance to take three students). Later on, she finds herself now clad in the Hispanic period San Selino school uniform.|$|R
5000|$|The 1964 squad {{returned}} its {{two leading}} scorers {{from the previous}} season, Gary Butler and Gordon Wilkie, both ex-Pats, who had combined for 79 points in just 24 games the previous season. They played better than expected, combining for a remarkable 135 points in just 29 games-both players finished just shy of Berenson's single-season record of 70 points. Rookie Wilf Martin added an unexpected 58 points. Mel Wakabayashi, all 5'5" [...] of him, join the team in January 1964, centering Rob Coristine and Bob Ferguson on the third line.

50|$|Zacchia got {{his first}} taste of {{endurance}} racing at the 2003 24 Hours of Le Mans. He raced for Larbre Compétition in the GTS class using a Chrysler Viper GTS-R. His team mates were Patrice Goueslard and 1993 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Christophe Bouchut. They finished 16th overall and fourth in class. Larbre signed Zacchia prior to the 2004 Le Mans Series season. He reunited with 2003 Le Mans team mate Bouchut, his other team mate was ex-F1 driver Pedro Lamy. The trio won every race in the GTS class with their Ferrari 550-GTS Maranello, thus winning the championship. Zacchia focused on FIA GT {{for the next two}} seasons before returning to LMS in 2007, once again with Larbe with support from Aston Martin Racing as Larbre ran their DBR9. His team mate {{for the majority of the}} season was Gregor Fisken. For the final round, the 2007 Mil Milhas Brasil, the duo were joined by Roland Bervillé and Brazilian racer Fernando Rees. It was the final round at Interlagos that he won in the GT1 class but only half points were awarded due to less than five cars competing in that particular class. Zacchia and Fisken finished eighth in the GT1 standings, with their No. 51 car finishing sixth in the teams championship. In 2008, he was signed by Swiss team Speedy Racing Team Sebah (now Rebellion Racing) for the Le Mans Series season. Zacchia raced a Lola B08/80-Judd in the LMP2 class along with team mates Andrea Belicchi and Xavier Pompidou The <b>trio</b> picked up <b>points</b> in only the first event of the season, the 1000 km of Catalunya where they finished second in class Zacchia and co. finished tenth in the drivers championship and seventh in the teams. Zacchia returned to the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2008 for Speedy, teaming up with LMS team mates Belicchi and Pompidou. Their LMP2-spec Lola-Judd retired after 194 laps.|$|R
40|$|This {{performance}} dissertation explored three significant piano trios, {{two major}} instrumental sonatas and a solo piano sonatine over {{the course of}} three recitals. Each recital featured the work of either Brahms, Tchaikovsky or Ravel. Each of these three composers had a special reverence for older musical forms and genres. The piano trio originated from various forms of trio ensemble in the Baroque period, which consisted of a dominating keyboard part, an accompanying violin, and an optional cello. By the time Brahms and Tchaikovsky wrote their landmark trios, the form had taken on symphonic effects and proportions. The Ravel <b>Trio,</b> another high <b>point</b> of the genre, written {{in the early twentieth}} century, went even further exploring new ways of using all possibilities of each instrument and combining them. The duo repertoire has come equally far: duos featuring a string instrument with piano grew from a humble Baroque form into a multifaceted, flexible classical form. Starting with Bach and continuing with Mozart and Beethoven, the form traveled into the Romantic era and beyond, taking on many new guises and personalities. In Brahms’ two cello sonatas, even though the cello was treated as a soloist, the piano still maintained its traditional prominence. In Ravel’s jazz-influenced violin sonata, he treated the two instruments with equal importance, but worked with their different natures and created an innovative sound combination. The solo piano work in this dissertation, the Ravel Sonatine, is beautifully constructed, revisiting older forms while being firmly rooted in new early-twentieth century Impressionist sounds. Two of the three recitals featured a major trio by Brahms and Ravel coupled with sonatas and a sonatine. The Tchaikovsky Trio, monumentally long and difficult, was presented alone at my lecture recital. The recitals were performed on December 7, 2014, November 15, 2015, and March 30, 2016 at the University of Maryland School of Music’s Gildenhorn Recital Hall, and I was assisted by violinists Sharon Oh and Dr. James Stern as well as cellists Seth Castleton and Andrew Hesse. The recitals were recorded on CDs, which {{can be found in the}} Digital Repository at the University of Maryland (DRUM) ...|$|R
50|$|This {{was a more}} {{straightforward}} day {{of racing}} than the one previous. Five riders formed the day's principal breakaway - Yaroslav Popovych, Kristof Vandewalle, Sacha Modolo, Frederik Veuchelen, and the original instigator Jussi Veikkanen. Their maximum advantage was left carefully controlled at six minutes. Modolo {{was the first to}} lose the pace, and rode for several kilometers in a no-man's land between the other four and the peloton, an effort that cost him sufficient strength that he finished dead last on the day. Veikkanen next fell off the pace to leave a leading <b>trio.</b> At this <b>point,</b> Modolo's teammate Stefano Pirazzi set off on the attack from the main field to try to bridge up to the leaders, but he was never able, being caught between the two groups for some 10 km. Pirazzi's attack made little if any strategic sense, but it pleased the roadside fans who had brought signs showing their support for the Italian. With about 10 km left to race, Vandewalle tried to solo to the finish, leaving Popovych and Veuchelen behind to be swept up by the main field. His advantage was only 48 seconds at that point, and the peloton reabsorbed him with just under 2 km remaining. Attacks from David Millar, František Raboň, Matthias Frank, and Robert Kišerlovski were all very short-lived. Within the final kilometer, Danilo Di Luca took first position on the road and for a moment appeared poised for victory before he was passed up by former teammate Alessandro Petacchi. The points leader had started his sprint from nearly 600 m out, since leadout man Danilo Hondo pulled off at that point upon seeing that Francisco Ventoso and not Petacchi was sitting in his slipstream. Ventoso occupied first position with about 100 m to go, at which point it seemed that Petacchi was going to pass him and claim the stage win, but the Italian suddenly stopped pedaling just meters from the finish line, giving Ventoso the stage win. When interviewed by media shortly after the stage's conclusion, Petacchi was so exhausted that for over a minute he did not have sufficient breath to speak, and could only gasp for air. He later said he was satisfied with second on the day, since the uphill finish meant victory was unlikely for a field sprinter like him. Ventoso, for his part, had targeted this stage ahead of time, believing that the group that arrived at the finish together would be select and not include the entire peloton. The top ten in the overall standings were essentially unchanged, giving Pieter Weening another day in the pink jersey.|$|R
