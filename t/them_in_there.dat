25|$|I {{started selling}} out on Dune. Looking back, it's no one's fault but my own. I {{probably}} shouldn't {{have done that}} picture, but I saw tons and tons of possibilities for things I loved, {{and this was the}} structure to do <b>them</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> was so much room to create a world. But I got strong indications from Raffaella and Dino De Laurentiis of what kind of film they expected, and I knew I didn't have final cut.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2006, Rowe was {{featured}} in an article admitting to the inaccuracy found in Loose Change, such as inaccurately stating a B-52 flew into the Empire State Building (it was actually a B-25 in the 1940s). [...] "We don't ever {{come out and say}} that everything we say is 100 percent. We know there are errors in the documentary, and we've actually left <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> so that people discredit us and do the research for themselves." [...] In 2007, media entrepreneur Mark Cuban was going to distribute Loose Change, and Charlie Sheen was going to narrate. However, this did not happen; Fox News political talk show host Bill O'Reilly interviewed Cuban on his radio show and said Sheen's career would be over if he narrated it.|$|E

[...] "They were drove from Spaddleholt Farm only yesterday, where Father bought 'em at a stiff price enough. They are wanting to get home again, the stupid toads! Will you shut the garden gate, dear, and help me to get <b>'em</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> are no men folk at home, only Mother, and they'll be lost if we don't mind." ...|$|R
50|$|Stathas and a {{group of}} Greek {{military}} commanders fled to the Aegean sea. In 1807, Kolokotronis met with <b>them</b> <b>in</b> Skiathos. <b>There,</b> Stathas and Nikotsaras were initiated to the Filiki Eteria.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{doubt if}} anybody could take <b>them</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> {{are only a}} few cottages and the mussel-gatherers and farm-hands have swarms of children. I rather imagine Jake would walk across the sands----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My idea was," [...] Mr. Weatherley proceeded, [...] "that {{one of my}} own young men--there are {{twelve of}} <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> aren't there?" [...] he added, jerking his head in the {{direction}} of the office--"might do. What do you think?" ...|$|E
60|$|Jon screwed his {{features}} into a scowl. They got in--with two other beasts!--oh! heaven! He tipped the porter unnaturally, in his confusion. The brute deserved nothing for putting <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> and {{looking as if}} he knew all about it into the bargain.|$|E
500|$|Rogan was the {{greatest}} pitcher that ever threw a ball. He had not only an arm to pitch with but a head to think with. Rogan was a smart pitcher with a wonderful memory. Once Rogan pitched to a batter, he never forgot that batter's weaknesses and strong points. And don't think Rogan was nicknamed [...] "Bullet" [...] for nothing. That guy had a ball that was almost too fast to catch. [...] He would really burn <b>'em</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b>|$|R
60|$|They {{were equally}} wealthy and equally old, They were equally timid and equally bold; They were equally tall {{as they stood}} in their shoes-- Between <b>them,</b> <b>in</b> fact, <b>there</b> was nothing to choose.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't {{we get to}} {{the yacht}} somehow?" [...] asked Sam. He was {{thinking}} of Grace and the other girls, and wondering what would become of <b>them</b> <b>in</b> case <b>there</b> was a fight on board.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why!" [...] he said, [...] "there {{are more}} of <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> I saw their eyes and heard them snarl. Now, give me a burning branch and I will show you, brother, {{that you are not}} the only one who can fight a lion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall put no more coals on the fire," [...] he said, [...] "and {{it will be}} out in {{a quarter}} of an hour. Put <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and leave the door open. I will close it in an hour when the oven cools." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{there are}} any of <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> now," [...] one of the Turks remarked as Wilkinson closely {{surveyed}} the islets through his glass, [...] "most likely they have made you out before this. I only hope {{there will not be}} too many of them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another Monarchs teammate, George Carr, said, Rogan was the {{greatest}} pitcher that ever threw a ball. He had not only an arm to pitch with but a head to think with.

6000|$|Presently Hastings looked round again. [...] "It's {{the team}} Bramfield hires {{out at the}} settlement," [...] he said. [...] "None of our friends would get him to drive <b>them</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> seem to be two men in the wagon. Bramfield will be one. I can't make out the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will see}} to it," [...] Mr. Parrot said. [...] "The ship's decks will be crowded up with cattle. She {{is a small}} craft, and I hear she will take as many as can be packed on her deck. She is {{alongside}} now, taking <b>them</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> is not much likelihood of any attention, whatever, being paid {{to you and your}} companion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'What shall I do with them?' {{said little}} Mr. Squirrel {{as soon as}} he was alone. 'It won't do for me to leave them where old King Bear will find them, for it might make him very angry.' At last he remembered a certain hollow tree. 'The very place!' cried little Mr. Squirrel. 'I'll drop <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> and no one will be any the wiser.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The Red Ryder Victory Patrol, a club {{founded in}} 1942 to {{encourage}} people in conservation practices that would help the war effort, was directly inspired by the radio show's popularity. Young listeners could get application cards from their local grocery stores and mail <b>them</b> <b>in.</b> <b>In</b> return <b>there</b> would receive a membership card, a certificate, a secret decorder and a 32-page comic book about [...] "Red Ryder".|$|R
60|$|The two Rovers {{were in no}} cheerful {{frame of}} mind. They {{realized}} that Sack Todd was much exercised {{over the fact that}} they had discovered the secret of the ranch, and what he would do to <b>them</b> <b>in</b> consequence <b>there</b> was no telling.|$|R

6000|$|... "Here was {{the secret}} of her blanched face, her shaken nerves, her peals of hysterical {{laughter}} on the next morning. But what {{had been in the}} box? What had she done with that? Of course, {{it must have been the}} old metal and pebbles which my client had dragged from the mere. She had thrown <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> at the first opportunity to remove the last trace of her crime.|$|E
60|$|Then Bill {{explained}} the affair to the Canarios {{as well as}} he could, and afterward drew his comrade back into the shadow of the deck-house to hold a council. Both of them felt somewhat lonely as they blinked at the desolation of dingy mangroves which hemmed <b>them</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> was, so far as they knew, not a white man in that part of Africa, and the intentions of the negroes were apparently by no means amicable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Spirits at your command! Yes, some of <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> I think," [...] and {{he pointed}} to the black bottle on the table, [...] "and others too, perhaps; I will not deny it. Well, let them advance, and we will see who is {{on the top of the}} mountain, I, the old paid {{advocate}} of God, or you and your spirits, Madame," [...] and hooking the handle of the big umbrella over his wrist, he folded his arms and stared at her through the blue spectacles.|$|E

50|$|Any vessel {{tracking}} system, including VMS, requires technology on the vessel, ashore, and communications between <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> addition, <b>there</b> may be additional communications from the Fisheries Management Center (FMC) of the vessel's country of registry, and regional or national FMCs {{of the waters}} in which the vessel is fishing.|$|R
50|$|Norwegian {{national}} road (Norwegian: Riksvei/Riksveg abbr. Rv; literally: road of the rike/realm), are roads thus {{categorized by}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (Statens vegvesen) which also maintains <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> 2007 <b>there</b> were 27,343 km of {{this class of}} Norwegian roads, which constituted 29.4% of public roads in Norway.|$|R
60|$|Three quarts {{only did}} Grief get, when the tiger sharks {{appeared}} and drove <b>them</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> were {{six of them}} on the Rock, and a pint a day, in the sweltering heat of the mid-tropics, is not sufficient moisture for a man's body. The next night Mauriri and Tehaa returned with no water. And the day following Brown learned the full connotation of thirst, when the lips crack to bleeding, the mouth is coated with granular slime, and the swollen tongue finds the mouth too small for residence.|$|E
60|$|And {{there the}} good whales lay, the happy sleepy beasts, upon the still oily sea. They were all right whales, you must know, and finners, and razor-backs, and bottle-noses, and spotted sea- unicorns with long ivory horns. But the sperm whales are such raging, ramping, roaring, rumbustious fellows, that, if Mother Carey let <b>them</b> <b>in,</b> <b>there</b> {{would be no}} more peace in Peacepool. So she packs them away in a great pond by {{themselves}} at the South Pole, two hundred and sixty-three miles south-south-east of Mount Erebus, the great volcano in the ice; and there they butt each other with their ugly noses, day and night from year's end to year's end.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{express the}} {{confusion}} I was in, though {{the joy of}} seeing a ship, and one that I had reason to believe was manned by my own countrymen, and consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe; but yet I had some secret doubts hung about me—I cannot tell from whence they came—bidding me keep upon my guard. In the first place, {{it occurred to me}} to consider what business an English ship could have {{in that part of the}} world, since it was not the way to or from any part of the world where the English had any traffic; and I knew there had been no storms to drive <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> in distress; and that if they were really English it was most probable that they were here upon no good design; and that I had better continue as I was than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.|$|E
50|$|Uzbek Jews {{have two}} {{distinct}} communities; the more religious and traditional Bukharan Jewish {{community and the}} more progressive, Europe extracted Ashkenazi community. There were 94,900 Jews in Uzbekistan in 1989, but fewer than 5,000 remained in 2007 (most of <b>them</b> <b>in</b> Tashkent). <b>There</b> are 12 synagogues in Uzbekistan.|$|R
