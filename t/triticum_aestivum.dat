Most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids; bread wheat, <b>Triticum</b> <b>aestivum,</b> is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses. Several commercial fruits including loganberry (Rubus × loganobaccus) and grapefruit (Citrus × paradisi) are hybrids, as are garden herbs such as peppermint (Mentha × piperita), and trees {{such as the}} London plane (Platanus × acerifolia). Among many natural plant hybrids is Iris albicans, a sterile hybrid that spreads by rhizome division, and Oenothera lamarckiana, a flower that {{was the subject of}} important experiments by Hugo de Vries that produced an understanding of polyploidy.|$|E

25|$|The oldest {{evidence}} for hexaploid wheat {{has been confirmed}} through DNA analysis of wheat seeds, dating to around 6400-6200 BCE, recovered from Çatalhöyük. The first identifiable bread wheat (<b>Triticum</b> <b>aestivum)</b> with sufficient gluten for yeasted breads has been identified using DNA analysis in samples from a granary dating to approximately 1350BCE at Assiros in Macedonia.|$|E
25|$|Most of the aspen parkland, {{like the}} prairie biome, has been {{extensively}} altered by agriculture over the last 100 years since settlement first {{began in the late}} 19th Century. While the climate is generally cooler than in the prairies, the climate is still mild and dry enough to support large-scale farming of crops such as canola (Brassica napsus), alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and wheat (<b>Triticum</b> <b>aestivum),</b> and livestock grazing. The soils in the aspen parkland biome are also quite fertile, especially around Edmonton and Saskatoon. Oil and natural gas exploration and drilling have also disturbed the natural habitat, especially in Alberta and northeastern British Columbia. As a result, less than 10% of the original habitat remains.|$|E
25|$|Flowers of Poaceae are {{characteristically}} {{arranged in}} spikelets, each having {{one or more}} florets. The spikelets are further grouped into panicles or spikes. The part of the spikelet that bears the florets is called the rachilla. A spikelet consists of two (or sometimes fewer) bracts at the base, called glumes, followed {{by one or more}} florets. A floret consists of the flower surrounded by two bracts, one external—the lemma—and one internal—the palea. The flowers are usually hermaphroditic—maize being an important exception—and anemophilous or wind-pollinated. The perianth is reduced to two scales, called lodicules, that expand and contract to spread the lemma and palea; these are generally interpreted to be modified sepals. This complex structure {{can be seen in the}} image on the right, portraying a wheat (<b>Triticum</b> <b>aestivum)</b> spikelet.|$|E
25|$|However, durum {{is a hard}} {{grain and}} was {{difficult}} to grind with the early hand-held grindstones. The flour also had to be sifted repeatedly to obtain fine flour (such as the solet required in the Temple offerings). Thus, durum was primarily used for porridges, or parboiled and dried, or roasted and boiled, and barley flour continued {{to be used for}} making bread, until another hybrid of emmer, common or “bread” wheat (<b>triticum</b> <b>aestivum)</b> replaced barley as the primary grain after the Greek conquest of the land of Israel and, together with durum wheat, became widespread during the Greco-Roman period, constituting the bulk of the grain crop {{by the end of the}} Second Temple period. The introduction of common wheat, which contained more starch and had a higher level of gluten, spread the use of wheat for bread-making and led to the production of loaves that were more lightly textured than barley and durum wheat breads.|$|E

2500|$|Barley is more {{tolerant}} of soil salinity than wheat, which might explain the increase of barley cultivation in Mesopotamia from the second millennium BCE onwards. Barley is not as cold tolerant as the winter wheats (<b>Triticum</b> <b>aestivum),</b> fall rye (Secale cereale) or winter triticale (× Triticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus.), but may be sown as a winter crop in warmer areas of [...] Australia and Great Britain.|$|E
2500|$|Outside of wetlands, soras {{are most}} often {{reported}} in cultivated areas during migration or in the postbreeding period. For instance, a sora was observed [...] from marshland in a cultivated field in Iowa {{in the middle of}} August. A male sora was observed less than [...] from a large wetland in a soybean (Glycine max) field in northwestern Iowa during the postbreeding period. From early June to mid-July, soras were observed on farms in Saskatchewan sown mainly with wheat (<b>Triticum</b> <b>aestivum).</b>|$|E
2500|$|Wheat {{gliadins}} {{and potentially}} oat avenins {{are associated with}} another disease, known as wheat-dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA) {{which is similar to}} baker's allergy as both are mediated by IgE responses. In WDEIA, however, the ω-gliadins or a high molecular weight glutenin subunit, and similar proteins in other Triticeae genera enter the blood stream during exercise where they cause acute asthmatic or allergic reaction. [...] One recent study of ω-gliadins demonstrated these gliadins are more similar to the bulk of oat avenins than α/β or γ gliadins but, so far, oat avenins have not been linked to WDEIA. Wheat may specifically induce WDEIA and certain chronic urticaria because the anti-gliadin IgE detects ω5-gliadins expressed by most of the Gli-B1 alleles but almost no responses prolamins extracted from rye or wheat/rye translocates. The Gli-B1 gene in wheat, <b>Triticum</b> <b>aestivum</b> comes from one of three progenitor species, Aegilops speltoides, indicating that nascent mutations on the B genome of wheat or [...] from a small number of cultivated triticeae species.|$|E
