In addition to tar and nicotine, tobacco also contains radioactive Polonium- 210 (Po- 210) which is very dangerous {{for the health of}} smokers. Po- 210 in cigarettes comes from the air and phosphate fertilizer often used by tobacco farmers to cultivate tobacco plants. The danger of Po- 210 is from emission of alpha particles as it decays into a stable lead (Pb- 206).

In 2009 and 2010, a group of TNO and Dutch Customs experts performed two experimental sessions involving air cargo containers, several <b>trace</b> <b>detector</b> systems and real explosive compounds at the cargo terminal of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Field experiments were designed in order to test the applicability of various commercially of the shelf trace detectors and promising newly-developed instruments with 6 + TRL levels for screening of air cargo containers and pallets. In order to select instruments suitable for cargo screening and trace detection of explosives hidden in cargo containers, a detailed market review and assessment of information acquired from diverse available sources has been performed during the initial phase of the project. In the subsequent stages a theoretical evaluation of the potential of these instruments or techniques was performed, followed by laboratory experiments and feasibility trials with selected devices and sampling tools. Preliminary investigation resulted in the fi nal choice of devices/systems matched to the acknowledged threat list. Six diff erent explosives – among them pure explosives as well as composites, characterized by diff erentiated physical and chemical properties were used during the experiments in two diff erent scenarios. All explosives were packaged and concealed, such that large quantities of explosive were not visually exposed and possibly not readily available for sampling and analysis, with the aim of avoiding easy, visual detection. All experiments were designed and performed by TNO employees with particular attention paid to meticulous and well-structured sampling procedures. Logistic schemes were built to secure the best possible performance for all instruments tested. All trace detectors were applied according to the instructions provided by the many cooperating suppliers, enabling the equipment to achieve the best results for each detector. In particular cases simple modifi cations to the sampling methods were carried out and/or additional sampling methods were introduced and tested. Both vapor and particle trace detectors were employed during the experiments. The results were analyzed directly after the sampling step or in more complicated cases the analysis was performed afterwards. The applicability of the particular set up or technique in a current scenario was evaluated. Functioning of the detectors used in a dedicated scenario was assessed in terms of the detection performance, observed false alarm rate and usage convenience.

Material and Methods: We conducted the measurement of periodic concentrations of radon (1 – 2 months) in the summer using type Tastrak <b>trace</b> <b>detectors.</b> We determined the average concentrations of radon in air in 66 underground tourist routes in Poland. Results: The research results comprise 259 determinations of average radon concentrations in 66 routes. The arithmetic average of the results was 1610 Bqm– 3, and the maximum measured concentration was over 20 000 Bqm– 3. The minimum concentration was 100 Bqm– 3 (threshold method) considering the arithmetic average of the measurements. It was found that in 67 % of the routes, the average concentration of radon has exceeded 300 Bqm– 3 and in 22 underground routes it exceeded 1000 Bqm– 3. Conclusions: Radon which occurs in many Polish underground tourist routes may be an organizational, legal and health problem. It is necessary to develop a program of measures to reduce radon concentrations in underground routes, especially routes located in the former mines. Med Pr 2015; 66 (4) : 557 – 56...|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{noses and}} similar sensors show promise for {{detecting}} buried landmines through the explosive trace signals they emit. A key {{step in this}} detection is the sampler or sniffer, which acquires the airborne trace signal and presents it to the detector. Practicality demands no physical contact with the ground. Further, both airborne particulates and molecular traces must be sampled. Given a complicated minefield terrain and microclimate, this becomes a daunting chore. Our prior research on canine olfactory aerodynamics revealed several ways that evolution has dealt with such problems: 1) proximity of the sniffer to the scent source is important, 2) avoid exhaling back into the scent source, 3) use an aerodynamic collar on the sniffer inlet, 4) use auxiliary airjets to stir up surface particles, and 5) manage the “impedance mismatch ” between sniffer and sensor airflows carefully. Unfortunately, even basic data on aerodynamic sniffer performance {{as a function of}} inlet-tube and scent-source diameters, standoff distance, etc., have not been previously obtained. A laboratory-prototype sniffer was thus developed to provide guidance for landmine <b>trace</b> <b>detectors.</b> Initial experiments with this device are the subject of this paper. For example, a spike in the trace signal is observed upon starting the sniffer airflow, apparently due to rapid depletion of the available signalladen air. Further, shielding the sniffer from disruptive ambient airflows arises as a key issue in sampling efficiency...|$|R

This is expressed both in the higher values of the radiation dose to be expected and in the deviation of the type and spectral distribution of cosmic radiation in space from terrestrial radiation.

Firstly, the radiation exposure of the astronaut onboard is to be detected and, secondly, the influence of radiation on the proper functioning of equipment and materials on and in the spacecraft is to be determined. The radiation measuring technique {{used for this purpose}} has to supply statements on the radiation doses, types of radiation and their spectral distribution to be expected. Based on the known effectiveness of radiation as a function of its type and energy, it is possible to derive risks and possible protective measures. The overall goal of this project was to carry out further research of the dynamic radiation situation in near space by means of passive radiation detectors.
