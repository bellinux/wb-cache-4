Rush criticized Obama: [...] "Barack Obama went to Harvard and became an educated fool. We’re not impressed with <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> with these Eastern elite degrees. Barack is a person who read about the civil-rights protests and thinks he knows all about it." [...] Trotter said, [...] "Barack is viewed in part to be the white man in blackface in our community." [...] Though the Chicago Tribune endorsed Obama, many, including local officials, President Bill Clinton, and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic Party nominee for President, endorsed Rush.|$|E

2500|$|With {{reference}} to the DNA tests, Witherington wrote in his blog: [...] "he most the DNA evidence can show is that several of <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> are interrelated…. We would need an independent control sample from some member of Jesus' family to confirm that these were members of Jesus' family. We do not have that at all." [...] This quote clarifies {{the fact that the}} documentarians do not believe they have tested the DNA and have proven it to be Jesus. They simply used DNA testing to prove that the [...] "Jesus son of Joseph" [...] and the [...] "Mariamne" [...] in this tomb were not maternally related (i.e. {{that they did not have}} the same mother or grandmother). The film asserted that this DNA evidence suggests they were probably spouses. Critics contend they could have been paternally related (e.g. father and daughter, or grandfather and granddaughter), or related by someone else's marriage. Mariamne could just as well have been the wife of one of the other two males in the ossuary.|$|E

2500|$|Maggie Stands Looking, a {{daughter}} of Oglala Lakota Chief American Horse, {{was among the first}} wave of children brought from Rosebud and one of Captain Pratt's model students. Maggie had difficulty adjusting to the demands of her new lifestyle at Carlisle, and once slapped Miss Hyde, the matron, when Hyde insisted that Maggie make her bed every day and keep her room clean. Instead of retaliating, Miss Hyde stood her ground and Maggie acquiesced. Like most of the Carlisle students, Maggie was enrolled in the Summer Outing Program. After her arrival to her country home, Maggie wrote a letter to Pratt. [...] "Dear Captain Pratt: What shall I do? I have been here two weeks and I have not bathed. <b>These</b> <b>folks</b> have no bath place. Your school daughter, Maggie Stands Looking." [...] Pratt advised her to do as he had done on the frontier and signed his letter [...] "Your friend and school father. R.H. Pratt."

2500|$|Writing for CNN, Sonia Katyal and Eduardo Peñalver {{said that}} [...] "A {{straight}} line {{runs from the}} 1930s sit-down strikes in Flint, Michigan, to the 1960 lunch-counter sit-ins to the occupation of Alcatraz by Native American activists in 1969 to Occupy Wall Street. Occupations employ physical possession to communicate intense dissent, exhibited by a willingness {{to break the law}} and to suffer the -- occasionally violent -- consequences." [...] Another CNN report by Douglas Rushkoff, said that even though the protesters are not ready to articulate an exact array of problems or how to solve them,"Anyone who says he has no idea what <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> are protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for {{most of the rest of}} us are getting tougher. What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns...They mean to show that there is an inappropriate and correctable disconnect between the abundance America produces and the scarcity its markets manufacture".|$|E
2500|$|The cast of V {{features}} {{a number of}} actors from other science-fiction series, including Lost, Firefly and Smallville. Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: [...] "Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus {{that a lot of}} <b>these</b> <b>folks</b> have appeared in genre shows in the past, but it was not designed that way. We also {{wanted to make sure that}} as we moved forward, we honoured and respected the characters and the themes that the (original) show envisioned, while introducing brand new characters and brand new themes that make sense in a post-9/11 world." [...] Mitchell was a fan of the original series as a child, recalling: [...] "I liked the escape of it; I liked the entertainment of it. It was a fun night for me. I was allowed to watch an hour of television with my parents, and we made a kind of celebration of it. I hope that other teenagers will do that with their parents with this show." [...] Mitchell's role in V sees her play an FBI agent with traits traditionally assigned to males. She commented: [...] "I like playing a traditional hero. I don't think I've ever done it before. Sigourney Weaver said she always chooses male roles because they are meatier." [...] Mitchell characterizes Erica as having [...] "a little bit of a hero complex", but [...] "her joy and her love and her true affection is with her son, and the fact that he is in imminent danger (makes it) fun to play." ...|$|E
