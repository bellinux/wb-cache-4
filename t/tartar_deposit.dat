40|$|In an Italian {{case-control study}} of oral cancer, number of missing teeth {{and other aspects}} of dental care were similar, but the general {{condition}} of the mouth, as indicated by gum bleeding, <b>tartar</b> <b>deposits</b> and mucosal irritation, was worse among oral cancer cases than controls. No differences were detected in sexual practices (including oral sex) and (previous) sexually transmitted infections. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R
40|$|The main {{interest}} {{of this paper}} generally refers {{to the results of}} an analysis regarding the influences of the <b>tartar</b> <b>deposits</b> effect on the water supply plumbing systems (mainly warm water installations made of steel pipes or polar plastic materials). The dysfunctional effect due to this effect has a consequence the increase of the linear pressure loss and the decrease of the service pressure of the consumers. To emphasize the effect of the <b>tartar</b> impurity <b>deposit</b> of the time behavior for the sanitary plumbing systems, the analysis was made using the MATLAB program facilities for the simulation of this phenomenon. The model allows several propositions to include the impurities deposit effect in the standard method to design the installations...|$|R
50|$|The Company's {{extensive}} {{connections in}} Europe enabled it to branch out into production of food-processing ingredients. In 1863, Erhart and Pfizer began importing crude argols — the <b>tartar</b> <b>deposits</b> formed in wine casks during the aging process—from France and Italy {{and set up}} their own refining operation for the manufacture of tartar and tartaric acid, which was used by bakers, beverage manufacturers, and in cooking. Sales began to climb, and by 1871, revenues of the young company were about $1.4 million.|$|R
500|$|A Russian Toy {{will often}} require {{the help of}} a {{veterinarian}} to remove any retained deciduous teeth (known as [...] "puppy teeth" [...] or [...] "baby teeth") that fail to fall out and make way for the permanent teeth. Without this intervention, usually done under anesthetic, the baby and permanent teeth will occupy the same socket in the jaw, which can cause <b>tartar</b> <b>deposits,</b> tooth decay, gingivitis and periodontitis, and can lead to premature loss of teeth. Retained puppy teeth can also cause misalignment of the teeth.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Paleomicrobiology {{establishes}} {{the diagnosis of}} ancient infectious diseases by studying ancient pathogens. This recent science also analyzes the evolution of these pathogens, virulence, and their adaptation to their habitat and their vectors. The DNA persists {{a long time after}} the death of an organism despite the chemical and enzymatic degradation. The possibility of sequencing bacterial, viral, parasitic and archaeal DNA molecules persists over time. Various sources are used for these studies: frozen tissue and particularly human tissue are a exceptional source for the analysis because at very low temperatures, all biological activity is suspended. The coprolites are a source of choice for studying the human microbiome. Other sources, the ancient bones are the most abundant, however, they may contain only small amounts of DNA due to natural leaching. When the use of the tooth is possible, is a particularly interesting source because of its highly mineralized structure, which gives greater persistence than bone. The calcified <b>tartar</b> <b>deposited</b> on teeth is a source of interest for the study of oral microbiome. All these sources are subject to precautions (gloves and masks hat) at the time of sampling to avoid cross contamination and also be listed in the most precise way because they are precious and rare...|$|R
2500|$|Teeth {{cleaning}} {{is part of}} {{oral hygiene}} and involves the removal of dental plaque from teeth {{with the intention of}} preventing cavities (dental caries), gingivitis, and periodontal disease. People routinely clean their own teeth by brushing and interdental cleaning, and dental hygienists can remove hardened <b>deposits</b> (<b>tartar)</b> not removed by routine cleaning. [...] Those with dentures and natural teeth may supplement their cleaning with a denture cleaner.|$|R
40|$|Parodontium {{diseases}} being {{a serious}} medico-social problem {{take one of}} the leading places in the structure of stomatological diseases. Inflammatory and dystrophic-inflammatory diseases such as catarrhal gingivitis and generalized periodontitis are the most spread among them. Complexity of the causation and pathogenesis of these diseases, their dependence upon many factors, deficiency of primary prevention stipulate high prevalence of both gingivitis and generalized peridontitis. Prevalence of parodontium tissue diseases depends, largely, on intensity of the local affecting causes: dental <b>tartar,</b> dental <b>deposit,</b> carriers and its complications, fillings of not good quality, not qualitative orthopedic constructions. In persons, connected with various occupational diseases, frequency of parodontium tissue diseases significantly increases. Attention should be paid, in particular, to enterprises, where women constitute the basic manpower. This problem deserves assiduous studying in the context of demographic policy.
