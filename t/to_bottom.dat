5|$|The new castle needed {{constant}} {{investment to}} maintain its quality as a military fortification. Winter floods in 1315–16 damaged the soil {{at the base of}} the motte, requiring immediate repairs.

5|$|The sand whiting's {{distinctive}} {{body shape}} and mouth placement is an adaptation <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> feeding, {{which is the}} predominant method of feeding for all whiting species. All larger whiting feed by using their protrusile jaws and tube-like mouths to suck up various types of prey from in, on or above the ocean substrate, as well as using their nose as a 'plough' to dig through the substrate.|$|E
5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly from top <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc {{is close to the}} boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
5|$|Because all {{languages}} have a {{very large}} number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right to left as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top <b>to</b> <b>bottom).</b> A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.|$|E

5|$|Chinese {{characters}} {{conform to}} a roughly square frame {{and are not}} usually linked to one another, so {{do not have a}} preferred direction of writing. Traditionally Chinese text was written in vertical columns which were read from top <b>to</b> <b>bottom,</b> right-to-left; the first column being {{on the right side of}} the page, and the last column on the left. Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no punctuation, with sentence and phrase breaks are determined by context and rhythm. Vertical Chinese is still used for effect or where space requires it, such as signs or on spines of books.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E
5|$|In the Case 1 diagram, B1 cells show {{canonical}} values, {{which are}} color-coded {{to show their}} row-wise distribution in B2 triplets. Colors reflect distribution but not location or values. For this case: the B2 top row triplet (r21) has 1 value from B1 middle triplet, the other colorings can now be deduced. E.g. the B2 bottom row triplet (r23) coloring is forced by r21: the other 2 B1 middle values must go <b>to</b> <b>bottom,</b> etc. Fill {{in the number of}} B2 options for each color, 3..1, beginning top left. The B3 color-coding is omitted since the B3 choices are row-wise determined by B1, B2. B3 always contributes 3! permutations per row triplet, or 63 for the block.|$|E

5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow from top <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the {{sole of the foot}} venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 1999, the {{spotlights}} {{surrounding the}} Peace Candle were accidentally turned on, {{and the heat}} from the lights ignited a fire among several of the Christmas trees surrounding the structure. Several residents called police and sprayed the flames with fire extinguishers until city firefighters arrived to put out the blaze. Although flames reached as high as 30 feet, only the trees were damaged and the Peace Candle itself was undamaged. The incident spurred discussion about removing the trees altogether, but Easton officials insisted the fire was just a fluke accident. New spotlights were installed in 2000, which lit the candle from top <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> and focused on the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic unit}} of Maya hieroglyphic text is the glyph block, which transcribes {{a word or}} phrase. The block is {{composed}} {{of one or more}} individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space. Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern. For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> numerically. Thus, any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified: C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards. If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc. Numeric row labels restart from 1 for each discrete unit of text.|$|E

5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top <b>to</b> <b>bottom,</b> were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on {{the left side of}} the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5|$|The finless sleeper ray is {{susceptible}} <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> trawls {{and perhaps}} other demersal fishing gear. It {{is a potential}} bycatch of fisheries operating throughout its range, which are particularly intense in the Andaman Sea. Most individuals caught are probably discarded, though post-capture survival rates {{are believed to be}} extremely low. Additionally, catches of this species by Burmese fishers are often sold in Phuket in Thailand. Due to heavy fishing pressure within its range and its low reproductive rate, the finless sleeper ray has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Specific population data are lacking, but at least off Thailand electric ray populations overall appear to have declined since 1975.|$|E
5|$|The pupal {{transformation}} into a butterfly through metamorphosis has held great appeal to mankind. To transform from the miniature wings {{visible on the}} outside of the pupa into large structures usable for flight, the pupal wings undergo rapid mitosis and absorb a great deal of nutrients. If one wing is surgically removed early on, the other three will grow to a larger size. In the pupa, the wing forms a structure that becomes compressed from top <b>to</b> <b>bottom</b> and pleated from proximal to distal ends as it grows, so that it can rapidly be unfolded to its full adult size. Several boundaries seen in the adult colour pattern are marked by changes in the expression of particular transcription factors in the early pupa.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to test three {{flexible}} polyurethane foams for mattress for comfort and durability. In particular, they were investigated the effects of foam composition and cell architecture on some physical-mechanical properties of interest for bedding applications and related to foam comfort levels (i. e. surface firmness, hysteresis loss and resistance <b>to</b> <b>bottoming</b> out), and their changes after artificial weathering due to moisture and temperature. The results demonstrated that all the three foams have open cell morphology and similar cell structure, with average cell diameters ranging from 430 to 510 micron and wide cell size distribution. As a consequence, they also show comparable water vapor transport behavior. On the contrary, their mechanical response, in terms of hysteresis loss, surface firmness and resistance <b>to</b> <b>bottoming</b> out, was found strongly dependent on their chemical structure and molecular mobility, as inferred from infrared spectroscopy analysis. During accelerated weathering all the foams undergo oxidations that affected their comfort factors in static conditions, giving a progressive lowering of hysteresis loss, surface firmness and resistance <b>to</b> <b>bottoming</b> out, particularly for the two foams having lower crosslinking level and thus slow recovery rate after compression...|$|R
