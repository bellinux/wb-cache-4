40|$|AbstractFungal vacuoles are acidic organelles with degradative {{and storage}} {{capabilities}} that have many similarities to mammalian lysosomes and plant vacuoles. In {{the past several}} years, well-developed genetic, genomic, biochemical and cell biological tools in S. cerevisiae have provided fresh insights into vacuolar protein sorting, organelle acidification, ion homeostasis, autophagy, and stress-related functions of the vacuole, and these insights have often found parallels in mammalian lysosomes. This review provides a broad overview of the defining features and functions of S. cerevisiae vacuoles and compares these features to mammalian lysosomes. Recent research challenges the traditional view of vacuoles and lysosomes as simply the <b>terminal</b> <b>compartment</b> of biosynthetic and endocytic pathways (i. e. the “garbage dump” of the cell), and suggests instead that these compartments are unexpectedly dynamic and highly regulated...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{principle of}} pharmacokinetic modeling {{is to use}} the least complicated model possible that adequately describes the process studied. Pharmacokinetic studies in peritoneal dialysis often attempt to describe the time course of drug concentration in the dialysate. Peritoneal dialysis patients are subjected to the inconvenience and risk of infection associated with sampling peritoneal fluid. Alternative pharmacokinetic models were used to study drug distribution during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Efficient pharmacokinetic models of distribution in the peritoneal cavity were described for three drugs and the classes they represent. Procainamide pnarmacokinetics were determined in six CAPD patients. The time course of procainamide or N-acetylprocainamide (NAPA) in the peritoneal fluid is of less interest than the amount cleared through the peritoneum. Therefore the peritoneal cavity is treated as a <b>terminal</b> <b>compartment.</b> Procainamide and NAPA exhibited mean elimination half-lives of 26 and 42. 9 hours respectively. CAPD accounted for 1. 1 % and 13 % of total body clearance of procainamide and NAPA respectively. Phenytoin pharmacokinetics were studied to determine the time course of dialysate phenytoin concentrations with respect to drug unbound to plasma proteins (free phenytoin). The peritoneal cavity was modeled as part of the peripheral compartment. CAPD did not prove to be an effective elimination pathway for phenytoin, accounting for only 2. 1 % of total body clearance of phenytoin. Closed compartment pharmacokinetic theory was investigated as an alternative modeling method when the drug has no other elimination pathway than the peritoneal cavity. In this case, vancomycin closed compartment pharmacokinetics were compared to open model analysis. Both models were used to predict an end of dwell concentration by fitting the data from a previous dwell. It was found that the closed model approach required less data and provided prediction close to the open model predictions. The model used depends on the underlying pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug and the aims of the study. A <b>terminal</b> <b>compartment</b> method is sufficient when only clearance due to CAPO is required. When the drug is not administered intraperitoneally, the peritoneal space can be described as part of the peripheral compartment. Closed compartment pharmacokinetics are useful when the drug in question is eliminated only through the peritoneum. Whatever model is used, the investigator must consider the integrity of the peritoneal membranes, ultrafiltration, and volume shifts within the peritoneal cavity...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{trafficking}} steps occur between the last compartment of the Golgi apparatus (TGN) and the vacuole of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To date, two intracellular routes from the TGN to the vacuole have been identified.

Proteins resident to the TGN achieve their localization despite a continuous flux of traffic by continually being retrieved from the distal PVC by virtue of an aromatic amino acid–containing sorting motif.

40|$|Lysosomes, {{the major}} membrane-bound degradative organelles, have a {{multitude}} of functions in eukaryotic cells. Lysosomes are the <b>terminal</b> <b>compartments</b> in the endocytic pathway, though they display highly dynamic behaviors, fusing {{with each other and}} with late endosomes in the endocytic pathway, and with the plasma membrane during regulated exocytosis and for wound repair. After fusing with late endosomes, lysosomes are reformed from the resulting hybrid organelles through a process that involves budding of a nascent lysosome, extension of the nascent lysosome from the hybrid organelle, while remaining connected by a membrane bridge, and scission of the membrane bridge to release the newly formed lysosome. The newly formed lysosomes undergo cycles of homotypic fusion and fission reactions to form mature lysosomes. In this study, we used a forward genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans to identify six regulators of lysosome biology. We show that these proteins function in different steps of lysosome biology, regulating lysosome formation, lysosome fusion, and lysosome degradation...|$|R

40|$|Magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus (SON) can {{differentially}} control peptide {{release from}} the somato/dendritic and axon <b>terminal</b> <b>compartment.</b> Dendritic release can be selectively regulated through activation of intracellular calcium stores by calcium mobilizers such as thapsigargin (TG), resulting in preparation (priming) of somato/dendritic peptide pools for subsequent activity-dependent release. As dynamic modulation of the actin cytoskeleton is implicated in secretion from synaptic terminals and from several types of neuroendocrine cells, we studied its involvement in oxytocin and vasopressin release from SON neurons. Confocal image analysis of the somata revealed that the normally continuous cortical band of F-actin is disrupted after high potassium (K+, 50 mm) or TG (200 nm) stimulation. The functional importance of actin remodelling was studied using cell-permeable actin polymerizing (jasplakinolide, 2 μm) or depolymerizing agents (latrunculin B, 5 μm) to treat SON and neural lobe (NL) explants in vitro and measure high K+-induced oxytocin and vasopressin release. Latrunculin significantly enhanced, and jasplakinolide inhibited, high-K+-evoked somato/dendritic peptide release, while release from axon terminals was not altered, suggesting that high-K+-evoked release in the SON, but not the NL, requires depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton. TG-induced priming of somato/dendritic release was also blocked by jasplakinolide and latrunculin, suggesting that priming involves changes in actin remodelling...|$|E

Gamma-vinyl-GABA (GVG), a catalytic inhibitor of GABA-transaminase, was microinjected directly into each of four brain areas: superior colliculus (SC), substantia nigra (SN), frontal cortex (CTX) and caudate-putamen (CP). The subsequent rate of GABA accumulation was linear for at least 90 min in all regions, and {{was found to be}} 2 - 3 times higher in the SC and SN than in the CTX and CP. The nerve terminal contribution to the initial rate of GABA accumulation after GVG was determined by comparing values obtained in the intact SN with those obtained in the SN in which the GABAergic afferent terminals had been destroyed. The initial rate of GABA accumulation in the denervated SN was less than one-half of that measured in the intact SN, indicating that, under normal conditions, both nerve-terminal and non-nerve-terminal (perikarya, glia) compartments contribute to the rate of GABA accumulation after GABA-transaminase inhibition. Our results indicate that the intracerebral injection of GVG is a sensitive and reliable method for studying in vivo GABA synthesis in brain. Although the rate of GABA accumulation after GVG is sensitive to changes in the nerve <b>terminal</b> <b>compartment,</b> other GABA compartments may also influence these measurements...|$|E
40|$|Great {{progress}} has been made in the elucidation of the function of proteins in membrane traffic. Less is known about the regulatory role of lipids in membrane dynamics. Studies of nerve <b>terminals,</b> <b>compartments</b> highly specialized for the recycling of synaptic vesicles, have converged with studies from other systems to reveal mechanisms in protein-lipid interactions that affect membrane shape as well as the fusion and fission of vesicles. Phosphoinositides have emerged as major regulators of the binding of cytosolic proteins to the bilayer. Phosphorylation on different positions of the inositol ring generates different isomers that are heterogeneously distributed on cell membranes and that together with membrane proteins generate a “dual keys” code for the recruitment of cytosolic proteins. This code helps controlling vectoriality of membrane transport. Powerful methods for the detection of lipids are rapidly advancing this field, thus complementing the broad range of information about biological systems that can be obtained from genomic and proteomic approaches...|$|R
40|$|Lipid {{modifications}} {{are essential}} in cellular sorting and trafficking inside cells.

In this work, we identify a dynamic association of the lipid kinase PI 4 KIIIb with Lys and unveil its regulatory function in lysosomal export and retrieval. We have found that absence of PI 4 KIIIb leads to abnormal formation of tubular structures from the lysosomal surface and loss of lysoso-mal constituents through these tubules. We demonstrate that the kinase activity of PI 4 KIIIb is necessary to prevent this unwanted lysosomal efflux under normal conditions, and to facilitate proper sorting when recycling of lysosomal material is needed, such as in the physiological context of lysosomal reformation after prolonged starvation...|$|R

40|$|Neurons {{are highly}} {{differentiated}} and polarized cells, whose various functions {{depend upon the}} compartmentalization of ion channels. The rat hypothalamic-neurohypophysial system (HNS), in which cell bodies and dendrites reside in the hypothalamus, physically separated from their nerve terminals in the neurohypophysis, provides a particularly powerful preparation in which to study the distribution and regional properties of ion channel proteins. Using electrophysiological and immunohistochemical techniques, we characterized the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channel {{in each of the}} three primary compartments (soma, dendrite, and terminal) of HNS neurons. We found that dendritic BK channels, in common with somatic channels but in contrast to nerve terminal channels, are insensitive to iberiotoxin. Furthermore, analysis of dendritic BK channel gating kinetics indicates that they, like somatic channels, have fast activation kinetics, in contrast to the slow gating of terminal channels. Dendritic and somatic channels are also more sensitive to calcium and have a greater conductance than terminal channels. Finally, although terminal BK channels are highly potentiated by ethanol, somatic and dendritic channels are insensitive to the drug. The biophysical and pharmacological properties of somatic and dendritic versus nerve terminal channels are consistent with the characteristics of exogenously expressed alphabeta 1 versus alphabeta 4 channels, respectively. Therefore, one possible explanation for our findings is a selective distribution of auxiliary beta 1 subunits to the somatic and dendritic compartments and beta 4 to the <b>terminal</b> <b>compartment.</b> This hypothesis is supported immunohistochemically by the appearance of distinct punctate beta 1 or beta 4 channel clusters in the membrane of somatic and dendritic or nerve terminal compartments, respectively...|$|E

Radioisotopes and multi compartment transport boxes [see method column] {{were used to}} understand separately absorption and translocation in cases of several ions. Effects of hydrogen ions (pH) and calcium ions (Ca 2 +) have been studied as important factors of root environments. At pH 3, substantial ion absorption has been lost except {{in the case of}} iron. Iron absorption looks rather like adsorption, because negligible radioactive iron {{can be found in the}} outer sections of excised roots examined. At pH 3. 0 where a quick adsorption or {{absorption of}} iron is found, the hydrogen ion concentration is equivalent to 1. 0 mM. Even though this low pH level is fatal to plants, similar severe condition can be seen in a solution culture experiment, after the renewal of complete nutrient solution containing a few mM of ammonium, whenever ammoniumtolerant plants have grown up sufficiently. Calcium disturbed absorption of other ions as like a commonly accepted theory in the field of plant nutrition. Calcium interruption is more severe to sodium, monovalent cation, than to iron and manganese, polyvalent cations. However there is exception that an available fraction exuded into the <b>terminal</b> <b>compartment</b> through xylem is rather stable between non-and 0. 5 mM calcium levels. Besides the difference of carried fractions between the non and the low calcium treatment is not clear in the roots apart from the radio-activated tip section.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The protein {{trafficking}} pathway in eukaryotic {{cells is}} essential for maintenance of organelle identity, nutrient uptake, and adaptation to extracellular stimuli. The endocytic pathway is tasked with uptake of plasma membrane receptors and bulk extra-cellular material as well as interaction with the secretory pathway. The Rab 5 family of small GTPases are essential in maintaining the endocytic pathway. Rab 5 proteins are active only when bound to GTP. Due to the slow intrinsic rate of GTP loading, Rab 5 relies on the VPS 9 domain for activation. VPS 9 domains are highly conserved and function as activators of Rab 5 by promoting GDP release and GTP loading. The diversity {{of members of the}} Rab 5 subfamily and their activators indicates that this family may multiple roles in endocytosis. VPS 9 -domain proteins are themselves highly regulated. An emerging theory in this field suggests that modulating their localization may influence Rab 5 localization and therefore function. To address this I investigate possible regulatory roles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Vps 9 as influenced by ubiquitin. Yeast Vps 9 can both bind ubiquitin and become ubiquitylated, though it has remained unclear what, if any, influence these functions have on Vps 9 activity. These studies lead to the discovery of Muk 1, an alternate yeast Rab 5 activator with a VPS 9 -domain. The yeast vacuole or mammalian lysosome is considered the <b>terminal</b> <b>compartment</b> of endocytosis and the HOPS protein complex {{is essential for}} regulating membrane fusion at this organelle. This complex contains several carboxy-terminal RING domains. While most RING domains have been shown to possess E 3 ubiquitin ligase activity, the HOPS RING domains remain largely uncharacterized. Finally, I examined HOPS RING domain mutants to address their function for vacuole morphology and their relation to ubiquitin...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Stress-induced {{release of}} {{dynorphin}} and subsequent {{activation of the}} kappa opioid receptor (KOR) has been hypothesized to mediate the dysphoric component of stress. Evidence suggests that this dysphoria can alternately block or potentiate the rewarding properties of addictive drugs, while also directly inducing aversion. These effects have historically been described as being mediated by the ability of KOR activation to inhibit dopamine release within the nucleus accumbens. However, {{a growing body of}} evidence suggests that this model is overly simplistic. This dissertation focuses on improving our understanding of how KOR signaling pathways within dopamine neurons can mediate the aversive, anhedonic, and proaddictive properties of stress. We first attempt to understand if changes in dopamine signaling can model bivalent, KOR-induced changes in cocaine reward. These experiments show that a combination of KOR effects on the somatodendritic and <b>terminal</b> <b>compartments</b> of dopamine neurons induce similar shift in the activity of core-projecting dopamine neurons as are seen in the behavior of mice during a conditioned place preference experiment. We then proceed to demonstrate that activation of KOR within dopamine neurons of the VTA is both necessary and sufficient for mediating the aversive properties of KOR activation. Surprisingly, however, we find that it is phosphorylation of the receptor and subsequent activation of p 38 MAPK, and not KOR-induced inhibition of dopamine release, that is the key mediator of this behavior...|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{studies have}} {{suggested}} a functional link between cholesterol/sphingolipid metabolism and endocytic membrane traffic. Here we show that perturbing the cholesterol/sphingomyelin balance in the plasma membrane results in the massive formation of clusters of narrow endocytic tubular invaginations positive for N-BAR proteins. These tubules are intensely positive for sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK 1). SPHK 1 is also targeted to physiologically occurring early endocytic intermediates, and is highly enriched in nerve <b>terminals,</b> cellular <b>compartments</b> specialized for exo-endocytosis. Membrane recruitment of SPHK 1 involves a direct, curvature-sensitive interaction with the lipid bilayer mediated by a hydrophobic patch on the enzyme’s surface. The knockdown of SPHKs results in endocytic recycling defects, and a mutation that disrupts the hydrophobic patch of C. elegans SPHK fails to rescue the neurotransmission defects in loss-of-function mutants of this enzyme. Our studies support a role of sphingosine phosphorylation in endocytic membrane trafficking beyond the established function of sphingosine- 1 -phosphate in intercellular signaling...|$|R
40|$|BK {{channels}} are well studied targets of acute ethanol action. They play {{a prominent role}} in neuronal excitability and have been shown to {{play a significant role in}} behavioral ethanol tolerance in invertebrates. The focus of my work centers on the effects of alcohol on the BK channel and comprises studies that examine how subcellular location affects acute ethanol sensitivity and how duration of acute alcohol exposure impacts the development of rapid tolerance. My results also provide potential mechanisms which underlie acute sensitivity and rapid tolerance. I first explore BK channel sensitivity to ethanol in the three compartments (dendrite, cell body, and nerve terminal) of magnocellular neurons in the rat hypothalamic-neurohypophysial (HNS) system. The HNS system provides a particularly powerful preparation in which to study the distribution and regional properties of ion channel proteins because the cell bodies are physically separated from the nerve terminals. Using electrophysiological and immunohistochemical techniques I characterize the BK channel in each of the three primary compartments and find that dendritic BK channels, similar to somatic channels, but in contrast to nerve terminal channels, are insensitive to alcohol. Furthermore, the gating kinetics, calcium sensitivity, and iberiotoxin sensitivity of channels in the dendrite are similar to somatic channels but sharply contrast terminal channels. The biophysical and pharmacological properties of somatodendritic vs. nerve terminal {{channels are}} consistent with the characteristics of exogenously expressed αβ 1 vs. αβ 4 channels, respectively. Therefore, one possible explanation for my findings is a selective distribution of β 1 subunits to the somatodendritic compartment and β 4 subunits to the <b>terminal</b> <b>compartment.</b> This hypothesis is supported immunohistochemically by the appearance of distinct punctate β 1 or β 4 channel clusters in the membrane of somatodendritic or nerve terminal compartments, respectively. In conclusion, I found that alcohol sensitivity of BK channels within the HNS system is dependent on subcellular location and postulate that β-subunits modulate ethanol sensitivity of HNS BK channels. In the second and primary focus of my thesis I explore tolerance development in the striatum, a brain region heavily implicated in addiction. Numerous studies have demonstrated that duration of drug exposure influences tolerance development and drug dependence. To further elucidate the mechanisms underlying behavioral tolerance I examined if BK channel tolerance was dependent on duration of alcohol exposure using patch clamp techniques in cultured striatal neurons from P 8 rats. I found that persistence of rapid tolerance is indeed a function of exposure time and find it lasts surprisingly long. For example, after a 6 hr exposure to 20 mM ethanol, acute sensitivity was still suppressed at 24 hrs withdrawal. However, after a 1 or 3 hr exposure period, sensitivity had returned after only 4 hrs. I also found that during withdrawal from a 6 hr but not a 3 hr exposure the biophysical properties of BK channels change and that this change is correlated with an increase in mRNA levels of the alcohol insensitive STREX splice variant. Furthermore, BK channel properties during withdrawal from a 6 hr exposure to alcohol closely parallel the properties of STREX channels exogenously expressed in HEK 293 cells. In conclusion I have established that BK channels develop rapid tolerance in striatal neurons, that rapid tolerance is dependent upon exposure protocol, and is surprisingly persistent. These findings present another mechanism underlying BK channel tolerance and possibly behavioral tolerance. Since these phenomena are dependent on duration of drug exposure my results may find relevance in explaining how drinking patterns impact the development of alcohol dependence in humans...|$|E
40|$|Endocytosis is a {{fundamental}} property of all eukaryotic life. In contrast to animal cells the endosomal system of plants is largely unknown. Recent research indicates a central role of endocytosis as a regulatory mechanism in plant morphogenesis and growth (Baluska et al., 2003; Geldner et al., 2003). Motivated by the growing interest in plant endocytosis, this work was intended to examine the endocytic pathway and its regulation in plant cells by different approaches and techniques. Three-dimensional time-lapse (4 D) imaging was used to investigate the structure and dynamics of the plant vacuole, the <b>terminal</b> <b>compartment</b> of the endocytic pathway, and endosome trafficking in living tobacco BY- 2 cells. Staining of the vacuolar membrane and endocytic compartments was obtained by using internalization of membrane bound, fluorescent styryl dyes. 4 D imaging of the labeled vacuolar membrane revealed a structurally complex and dynamic morphology. The vacuole is traversed by multiple trans-vacuolar strands (TVS), which moved along each other {{and were able to}} fuse. New strands were created by fission of large membrane sheets. These observations lead to propose a model for TVS homeostasis whereby fusion and fission of TVS drive the alterations in TVS number that are observed across the cell cycle in plant cells (Kutsuna and Hasezawa, 2002). By double labeling, endocytic vesicle traffic was followed within the dynamic TVS. Membrane traffic and internalization was studied via different GFP fusion constructs. GFP fused to the GPI-anchored cell surface protein AtGPIP 1 from A. thaliana allowed to visualize the secretory pathway in connection to endocytosis of dye labeled plasma membrane and assess the effect of Brefeldin A (BFA) on both pathways in plant cells. BFA is a fungal toxin and affects Golgi structure, endocytic recycling and secretion in animal cells. Imaging of the BFA effects in the cellular context in plant cells showed the formation of ER-Golgi hybrids and so-called “BFA compartments”. Double labeling of secretory and endocytic pathway in one cell demonstrated that the “BFA compartment” is a composite structure consistent of endosomal and secretory membrane components. The regulation of endocytosis in plant cells was analyzed by an artificial receptor construct comprising of the cytosolic tail of the wild-type rabbit poly-Ig receptor and GFP on the extracellular side. The endocytic behavior of this fusion protein was compared with a second fusion protein containing the pIgR tail with a mutated endocytosis signal fused to GFP. The observed decrease in endocytosis of the mutant construct suggests the functionality of mammalian endocytosis signals in plant cells and indicates that the prerequisites for receptor-mediated endocytosis in plant cells exist. Furthermore, relocation of both fusion proteins to the cell plate during cytokinesis suggests that also the targeting signals within the pIgR tail are recognized. In addition to signal mediated endocytosis of the artificial receptor also the endocytosis signal of a native plant receptor-like protein was intended for examination. The Ve 2 protein from tomato was suggested as cell-surface receptor based on the sequence (Kawchuk et al., 2001). As the sequence also contains a potential endocytosis signal, Ve 2 and a mutant version of Ve 2 with altered endocytosis signal were chosen for fusion to GFP. However, the fusion proteins were localized to the ER, even after removal of a potential ER localization signal. In the last part of this work, an assay was developed that quantified membrane internalization in plant cells for screening of compounds on their effects on endocytosis. Testing of BFA confirmed the results obtained on cellular context by microscopy of transgenic cells expressing AtGPIP 1 -GFP and showed inhibition of recycling. In addition to its role in Golgi-mediated secretion and endocytic recycling, it was found that BFA also inhibited endocytic uptake in this study. The assay was further used to screen auxins and inhibitors of polar auxin transport. The polar auxin transport inhibitor TIBA was shown to inhibit membrane cycling of the auxin efflux carrier PIN 1 thereby resulting in inhibition of auxin transport (Geldner et al., 2001). The inhibition of membrane internalization by TIBA was confirmed in uptake assays. Auxins demonstrated a reversing effect on endocytosis in uptake assays. Taken together with the findings that inhibition of membrane cycling of PIN 1 blocks auxin transport, this suggests an auxin signaling pathway, where auxins mediate their own transport within the plant by endocytosis-mediated modulation of the activity of cell surface proteins by their levels at the plasma membrane...|$|E

Barrier function is reduced with the skin’s intrinsic aging process, however the molecular mechanisms involved are unknown. We previously demonstrated that Claudin (Cldn) -containing tight junctions (TJs) are essential {{in the development of}} the epidermis and that transgenic mice overexpressing Cldn 6 in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis undergo a perturbed terminal differentiation program characterized in part by reduced {{barrier function}}. To dissect further the mechanisms by which Cldn 6 acts during epithelial differentiation, we overexpressed a Cldn 6 cytoplasmic tail deletion mutant in the suprabasal compartment of the transgenic mouse epidermis. Although there were no gross phenotypic abnormalities at birth, subtle epidermal anomalies were present that disappeared by one month of age, indicative of a robust injury response. However, with aging, epidermal changes with eventual chronic dermatitis appeared with a concomitant barrier dysfunction manifested in increased trans-epidermal water loss. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed aberrant suprabasal Cldn localization with marked down-regulation of Cldn 1. Both the proliferative and <b>terminal</b> differentiation <b>compartments</b> were perturbed as evidenced by mislocalization of multiple epidermal markers.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about how {{metabolism}} changes during development. For most animal embryos, yolk protein is a principal source of nutrition, particularly of essential amino acids. Within eggs, yolk is stored inside large organelles called yolk platelets (YPs). We have gained insight into embryonic nutrition in the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis by studying YPs. Amphibians follow the ancestral pattern in which all embryonic cells inherit YPs from the egg cytoplasm. These YPs are consumed intracellularly {{at some point during}} embryogenesis, but it was not known when, where or how yolk consumption occurs. We have identified the novel yolk protein Seryp by biochemical and mass spectrometric analyses of purified YPs. Within individual YPs, Seryp is degraded to completion earlier than the major yolk proteins, thereby providing a molecular marker for YPs engaged in yolk proteolysis. We demonstrate that yolk proteolysis is a quantal process in which a subset of dormant YPs within embryonic cells are reincorporated into the endocytic system and become <b>terminal</b> degradative <b>compartments.</b> Yolk consumption is amongst the earliest aspects of differentiation. The rate of yolk consumption is also highly tissue specific, suggesting that nutrition in early amphibian embryos is tissue autonomous. But yolk consumption {{does not appear to be}} triggered by embryonic cells declining to a critically small size. Frog embryos offer a promising platform for the in vivo analysis of metabolism...|$|R
40|$|The seven {{mammalian}} isotypes of β tubulin are {{strikingly similar}} in amino acid sequence. The differences in isotypic sequence, although small, are nonetheless conserved in evolution, {{which suggests that}} they may confer distinct functional roles. If so, such roles should {{be reflected in the}} selective expression of isotypes by cell type, or even in the sorting of isotypes to within-cell pools. Hair cells of the vestibular sensory epithelia each possess a kinocilium, a microtubule-based organelle that could represent a distinct microtubule compartment, separate from the extensive microtubule network in the soma. The afferent neurons that innervate the vestibular sensory epithelia may also be functionally divided into dendritic, somatic, and axonal compartments, each with its own complement of microtubules. We have examined the distribution of β tubulin isotypes in gerbil vestibular epithelia using isotype-specific antibodies to four isotypes and indirect immunofluorescence. We found that hair cells selectively express βI and βIV tubulin, while supporting cells express βI, βII, and βIV tubulin. However, no sorting of isotypes between somatic and kinocilia compartments was found in hair cells. Vestibular ganglion cells display three isotypes in the soma, axon, and <b>terminal</b> dendrite <b>compartments</b> (βI, βII, and βIII tubulin), but only βIII tubulin was found in calyceal nerve endings. The implication of these findings is that β tubulin isotypes are not sorted to within-cell compartments in hair cells but are sorted in some vestibular neurons...|$|R
40|$|Measures of dopamine-regulating {{proteins}} in somatodendritic regions {{are often used}} only as static indicators of neuron viability, overlooking the possible impact of somatodendritic dopamine (DA) signaling on behavior and the potential autonomy of DA regulation between somatodendritic and <b>terminal</b> field <b>compartments.</b> DA reuptake capacity is less in somatodendritic regions, possibly placing a greater burden on de novo DA biosynthesis within this compartment to maintain DA signaling. Therefore, regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity may be particularly critical for somatodendritic DA signaling. Phosphorylation of TH at ser 31 or ser 40 can increase activity, but their impact on L-DOPA biosynthesis in vivo is unknown. Thus, determining their relationship with L-DOPA tissue content could reveal a mechanism by which DA signaling is normally maintained. In Brown-Norway Fischer 344 F 1 hybrid rats, we quantified TH phosphorylation versus L-DOPA accumulation. After inhibition of aromatic acid decarboxylase, L-DOPA tissue content per recovered TH protein was greatest in NAc, matched by differences in ser 31, but not ser 40, phosphorylation. The L-DOPA per catecholamine and DA turnover ratios were significantly greater in SN and VTA, suggesting greater reliance on de novo DA biosynthesis therein. These compartmental differences reflected an overall autonomy of DA regulation, as seen by decreased DA content in SN and VTA, but not in striatum or NAc, following short-term DA biosynthesis inhibition from local infusion of the TH inhibitor a-methyl-p-tyrosine, {{as well as in}} the long-term process of aging. Such data suggest ser 3...|$|R
40|$|Retinal {{degeneration}} {{and visual}} impairment {{are the first}} signs of juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis caused by CLN 3 mutations, followed by inevitable progression to blindness. We investigated retinal degeneration in Cln 3 Δex 1 - 6 null mice, revealing classic ‘fingerprint’ lysosomal storage in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), replicating the human disease. The lysosomes contain mitochondrial F 0 -ATP synthase subunit c along with undigested membranes, indicating a reduced degradative capacity. Mature autophagosomes and basal phagolysosomes, the <b>terminal</b> degradative <b>compartments</b> of autophagy and phagocytosis, are also increased in Cln 3 Δex 1 - 6 RPE, reflecting disruption to these key pathways that underpin the daily phagocytic turnover of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) required for maintenance of vision. The accumulated autophagosomes have post-lysosome fusion morphology, with undigested internal contents visible, while accumulated phagosomes are frequently docked to cathepsin D-positive lysosomes, without mixing of phagosomal and lysosomal contents. This suggests lysosome-processing defects affect both autophagy and phagocytosis, supported by evidence that phagosomes induced in Cln 3 Δex 1 - 6 -derived mouse embryonic fibroblasts have visibly disorganized membranes, unprocessed internal vesicles and membrane contents, in addition to reduced LAMP 1 membrane recruitment. We propose that defective lysosomes in Cln 3 Δex 1 - 6 RPE have a reduced degradative capacity that impairs the final steps of the intimately connected autophagic and phagocytic pathways that are responsible for degradation of POS. A build-up of degradative organellar by-products and decreased recycling of cellular materials is likely to disrupt processes vital to maintenance of vision by the RPE...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Salmonella typhimurium is an {{intracellular}} {{bacterial pathogen}} that remains enclosed in vacuoles (SCV) upon {{entry into the}} host cell. In this study we have examined the intracellular trafficking route of S. typhimurium within epithelial cells. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis showed that bacteria initiated fusion with lysosomal membrane glycoprotein (lgp) -containing compartments "o 15 min after bacterial internalization. This process was completed,o 75 min later and did not require microtubules. Cation-independent (CI) - or cation-dependent (CD) -mannose 6 -phosphate receptors (M 6 PRs) were not observed at detectable levels in SCV. Lysosomal enzymes showed a different distribution in SCV: lysosomal-acid phosphatase (LAP) was incorporated into these vacuoles with the same kinetics as lgps, while cathepsin D was present in a low proportion ('o 30 %) of SCV. Uptake experiments with fluid endocytic tracers such as fluorescein-dextran sulphate (F-DX) or horseradish-peroxi-dase (HRP) showed that after 2 h of uptake, F-DX was present in "o 75 % of lgp-containing vesicles in uninfected cells, while only "o 15 % of SCV contained small amounts of the tracer during the same uptake period. SCV also showed only partial fusion with HRP-preloaded secondary lysosomes, with "o 30 % of SCV having detectable amounts of HRP at 6 h after infection. These results indicate that SCV show limited accessibility to fluid endocytic tracers and mature lysosomes, and are therefore functionally separated from the endocytic route. Moreover, the unusual intracellular trafficking route of S. typhimurium inside epithelial cells has allowed us to establish the existence of two different lgp-containing vesicles in Salmonellainfected cells: one population is separated from the endocytic route, fusogenic with incoming SCV and may arise from a secretory pathway, while the second involves the classical secondary or mature lysosomes. YSOSOMES are acidic organelles considered to be <b>terminal</b> degradative <b>compartments</b> in the endocyti...|$|R
40|$|Selected {{mutations}} {{in the human}} α 4 or β 2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes cosegregate with a partial epilepsy syndrome known as autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). To examine possible mechanisms underlying this inherited epilepsy, we engineered two ADNFLE mutations (Chrna 4 S 252 F and Chrna 4 +L 264) in mice. Heterozygous ADNFLE mutant mice show persistent, abnormal cortical electroencephalograms with prominent delta and theta frequencies, exhibit frequent spontaneous seizures, and show an increased sensitivity to the proconvulsant action of nicotine. Relative to WT, electrophysiological recordings from ADNFLE mouse layer II/III cortical pyramidal cells reveal a > 20 -fold increase in nicotine-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents with no effect on excitatory postsynaptic currents. i. p. injection of a subthreshold dose of picrotoxin, a use-dependent γ-aminobutyric acid receptor antagonist, reduces cortical electroencephalogram delta power and transiently inhibits spontaneous seizure activity in ADNFLE mutant mice. Our {{studies suggest that the}} mechanism underlying ADNFLE seizures may involve inhibitory synchronization of cortical networks via activation of mutant α 4 -containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors located on the presynaptic <b>terminals</b> and somatodendritic <b>compartments</b> of cortical GABAergic interneurons...|$|R
40|$|A three-compartment {{model of}} the electrotonic {{structure}} of an identified motoneurone, the median gastric (m. g.) neurone of the stomatogastric ganglion of the spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) was constructed, based on the passive response of the cell to a step of injected current. While its structure is only remotely related {{to that of the}} cell, the model is able to predict the passive response of the cell to any wave form of injected current. The shape of the m. g. neurone provided the basis {{for the development of a}} multicompartment {{model of the}} cell from the simple compartment model. Unlike the three-compartment model, the multicompartment model has a structure that corresponds closely to that of the cell while it retains the ability to predict the passive response of the cell to any wave form of injected current. The multicompartment model was used to analyse the electrotonic structure and synaptic integration of the cell. The axon acts as a current sink, causing steady-state voltage attenuation between the tips of different dendrites and the integrating segment to range between 26 and 89 %. Steady-state voltage attenuation in the distal direction is 2 % or less. Synaptic inhibition of m. g. by Interneurone 1 was simulated with simultaneously activated conductance-increase synapses located on all dendritic end-compartments of the model. Inhibitory post-synaptic potential (i. p. s. p.) wave forms recorded in the cell soma were duplicated in the soma compartment when the synaptic conductance change in each of the twenty-eight end-compartments was set equal to 5 nS for 8 ms. I. p. s. p. wave forms in dendritic end-compartments were 30 % larger than the soma compartment i. p. s. p., while i. p. s. p. s in the integrating segment compartment were intermediate in size. Charge from a 92 mV, 1 ms action potential in the model axon was passively conducted from axonal compartments to the soma compartment of the model, where it reproduced the attenuated, broadened voltage wave forms of action potentials recorded in the cell soma. Passive spread of charge from an axonal action potentials to <b>terminal</b> dendritic <b>compartments</b> evoked potentials there that were 30 % larger and faster than the corresponding soma compartment potential...|$|R
40|$|Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn), {{the major}} causative agent of human fungal meningoencephalitis, {{replicates}} within phagolysosomes of infected host cells. Despite {{more than a}} half-century of investigation into host-Cn interactions, host factors that mediate infection by this fungal pathogen remain obscure. Here, we describe {{the development of a}} system that employs Drosophila S 2 cells and RNA interference (RNAi) to define and characterize Cn host factors. The system recapitulated salient aspects of fungal interactions with mammalian cells, including phagocytosis, intracellular trafficking, replication, cell-to-cell spread and escape of the pathogen from host cells. Fifty-seven evolutionarily conserved host factors were identified using this system, including 29 factors that had not been previously implicated in mediating fungal pathogenesis. Subsequent analysis indicated that Cn exploits host actin cytoskeletal elements, cell surface signaling molecules, and vesicle-mediated transport proteins to establish a replicative niche. Several host molecules known to be associated with autophagy (Atg), including Atg 2, Atg 5, Atg 9 and Pi 3 K 59 F (a class III PI 3 -kinase) were also uncovered in our screen. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated depletion of these autophagy proteins in murine RAW 264. 7 macrophages demonstrated their requirement during Cn infection, thereby validating findings obtained using the Drosophila S 2 cell system. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy analyses demonstrated that Atg 5, LC 3, Atg 9 a were recruited to the vicinity of Cn containing vacuoles (CnCvs) {{in the early stages of}} Cn infection. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy and/or PI 3 -kinase activity further demonstrated a requirement for autophagy associated host proteins in supporting infection of mammalian cells by Cn. Finally, systematic trafficking studies indicated that CnCVs associated with Atg proteins, including Atg 5, Atg 9 a and LC 3, during trafficking to a <b>terminal</b> intracellular <b>compartment</b> that was decorated with the lysosomal markers LAMP- 1 and cathepsin D. Our findings validate the utility of the Drosophila S 2 cell system as a functional genomic platform for identifying and characterizing host factors that mediate fungal intracellular replication.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Activation of GABA(B) receptors in the dentate gyrus (DG) enhances {{granule cell}} (GC) {{activity}} by reducing synaptic inhibition imposed by hilar interneurons. This disinhibitory action facilitates signal transfer from the perforant {{path to the}} hippocampus. However, as the two main molecular subtypes, GABA(B(1 a, 2)) and GABA(B(1 b, 2)) receptors, prefer axonal <b>terminal</b> and dendritic <b>compartments,</b> respectively, they may modulate the hilar pathways at different synaptic localisations. We examined their relative expression and functions in the DG. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The localisation of GABA(B) subtypes was revealed immunohistochemically using subunit-selective antibodies in GABA(B 1 a) (-/-) and GABA(B 1 b) (-/-) mice. Effects of subtype activation by the GABA(B) receptor agonist, baclofen, were examined on the perforant path-stimulated GC population activities in brain slices. KEY RESULTS: GABA(B(1 a, 2)) receptors were concentrated in the inner molecular layer, the neuropil of the hilus and hilar neurons at the border zone; while GABA(B(1 b, 2)) receptors dominated the outer molecular layer and hilar neurons in the deep layer, showing their differential localisation on GC dendrite and in the hilus. Baclofen enhanced the GC population spike to a larger extent in the GABA(B 1 b) (-/-) mice, demonstrating exclusively disinhibitory roles of the GABA(B(1 a, 2)) receptors. Conversely, in the GABA(B 1 a) (-/-) mice baclofen not only enhanced but also inhibited the population spike during GABA(A) blockade, revealing both disinhibitory and inhibitory effects of GABA(B(1 b, 2)) receptors. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The GABA(B(1 a, 2)) and GABA(B(1 b, 2)) receptor subtypes differentially modulate GC outputs via selective axonal terminal and dendritic locations in the hilar pathways. The GABA(B(1 a, 2)) receptors exclusively mediate disinhibition, thereby playing {{a greater role in}} gating signal transfer for hippocampal spatial and pattern learning...|$|R
