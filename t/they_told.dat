On one occasion in Texas, <b>they</b> <b>told</b> their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as {{a way that they}} increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E

Olajuwon was not highly recruited and was merely offered {{a visit to the}} university to work out for the coaching staff, based on a recommendation from a friend of Lewis who had seen Olajuwon play. He later recalled that when he originally arrived at the airport in 1980 for the visit, no representative of the school was there to greet him.

In the other two conditions, <b>they</b> were <b>told</b> <b>they</b> would not receive caffeine; in one they did not, but in the other they did. This design was used in order to compare and evaluate two opposing models of drug conditioning. Results showed many effects of the drug and expectancy, but were inconclusive about which model governs drug taking behavior...|$|R

Bowers agreed, and immediately began recruiting ex-police and ex-firefighters from Denver.|$|E
5|$|The West Side Boys were unstable, {{possibly}} due to prolonged use of cannabis and cocaine, {{and their}} behaviour {{during the crisis}} was erratic. After their release, the five soldiers described an incident in which Kallay, dissatisfied with their explanation, conducted a mock execution in which he threatened to shoot the soldiers unless <b>they</b> <b>told</b> him why they had entered the West Side Boys' territory. The gang's drug habits also posed {{a problem for the}} British negotiators as the cannabis caused them to forget previous discussions and the cocaine made them distrustful.|$|E

Maurice and Lyda sit by the fire, holding hands, saying that they almost had the two agents. Meanwhile, at Mulder's apartment, Mulder and Scully exchange gifts, even though <b>they</b> <b>told</b> each other they would not.|$|E

Mikalsen also contacted the Bodø rescue team, which was equipped with a Sea King helicopter, but <b>they</b> <b>told</b> him that the helicopter had left to transport a sick child.

40|$|Sixty {{preschool}} children {{were asked to}} perform either an objectively easy task which <b>they</b> were <b>told</b> was easy for other children, an objectively easy task which <b>they</b> were <b>told</b> was difficult for others, an objectively difficult task which <b>they</b> were <b>told</b> was easy for others, or an objectively difficult task which <b>they</b> were <b>told</b> was difficult. Their level {{of success and failure}} in achievement activity prior to performing this task was manipulated. Results indicated that when the task was either objectively difficult or allegedly difficult for other children, subjects who had failed on a previous task persevered longer than did subjects who had previously succeeded. However, when the task was both objectively easy and apparently easy for others, subjects who had previously been successful persevered longer than subjects who had previously failed. Results were inconsistent with achievement motivation theory (Atkinson, 1957), but were interpretable using an exchange formulation of behavior (Thibaut and Kelley, 1959). © 1967...|$|R
5|$|Cinematographer Roger Deakins {{discussed}} {{the look of}} the film with the Coens during pre-production. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> him that they wanted some parts of the film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.|$|E

Instead, they both enrolled in the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, which allows students to plan their own curriculum. Cole focused his curriculum on the humanities and archaeology while Dylan focused on video game design.

While Heffernan did not support the challenger, after other officers saw him with the sign <b>they</b> <b>told</b> senior officers, including the police chief, who strongly supported the mayor.
