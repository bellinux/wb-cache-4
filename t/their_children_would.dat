5|$|Nevertheless, {{many white}} Zimbabweans {{complained that they}} were {{suffering}} from racial discrimination. Many whites remained uneasy about living under the government of a black Marxist and they also feared that <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> be unable to secure jobs. There was a growing exodus to South Africa, and in 1980, 1700 whites—approximately {{a tenth of the}} white Zimbabwean population—emigrated. Mugabe's government had pledged support for the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid forces within South Africa, although did not allow them to use Zimbabwe as a base for their military operations. To protest apartheid and white minority rule in South Africa, Mugabe's government banned Zimbabwe from engaging South Africa in any sporting competitions. In turn, South Africa tried to destabilise Zimbabwe by blocking trade routes into the country and supporting anti-Mugabist militants among the country's white minority.|$|E
5|$|With {{the growth}} of {{settlement}} in Pearsall's Flats, which was later the location of Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans {{for the establishment of}} schools and churches. A log structure, which served as both a school and a church, was built at Pearsall's Flats around 1752 near Fort Pearsall. To provide for a teacher's payment, a form was circulated around Romney and each parent indicated on the paper how many of <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> attend the school and the type of payment the teacher would expect. By the time Romney was surveyed by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron laid out the town of Romney in 1762, the log school was still in existence. That year, a stone school building was erected on the site to the immediate north of the old Hampshire County Courthouse and became known as Romney Academy.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, it was {{discovered}} that medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) produce more ketone bodies per unit of energy than normal dietary fats (which are mostly long-chain triglycerides). MCTs are more efficiently absorbed and are rapidly transported to the liver via the hepatic portal system rather than the lymphatic system. The severe carbohydrate restrictions of the classic ketogenic diet made it difficult for parents to produce palatable meals that <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> tolerate. In 1971, Peter Huttenlocher devised a ketogenic diet where about 60% of the calories came from the MCT oil, and this allowed more protein and up to three times as much carbohydrate as the classic ketogenic diet. The oil was mixed with at least twice its volume of skimmed milk, chilled, and sipped during the meal or incorporated into food. He tested it on twelve children and adolescents with intractable seizures. Most children improved in both seizure control and alertness, results that were similar to the classic ketogenic diet. Gastrointestinal upset was a problem, which led one patient to abandon the diet, but meals were easier to prepare and better accepted by the children. The MCT diet replaced the classic ketogenic diet in many hospitals, though some devised diets that were a combination of the two.|$|E

25|$|According to the Indian Act, status Indian {{women who}} married {{men who were}} not status Indians lost their treaty status, and <b>their</b> <b>{{children}}</b> <b>would</b> not get status. However, in the reverse situation, if a status Indian man married {{a woman who was}} not a status Indian, the man would keep his status and his children would also receive treaty status. In the 1970s, the Indian Rights for Indian Women and Native Women's Association of Canada groups campaigned against this policy because it discriminated against women and failed to fulfill treaty promises. They successfully convinced the federal government to change the section of the act with the adoption of Bill C-31 on June 28, 1985. Women who had lost their status and children who had been excluded were then able to register and gain official Indian status. Despite these changes, status Indian women who married men who were not status Indians could pass their status on only one generation: <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> gain status, but (without a marriage to a full-status Indian) their grandchildren would not. A status Indian man who married a woman who was not a status Indian retained status as did his children, but his wife did not gain status, nor did his grandchildren.|$|E

Their first child, Laura, was born in April 1951. In 1952, the small family moved to Paris, where Harry continued his studies in conducting at I’Ecole Normale de Musique (Paris Normal School of Music).

25|$|In his Notes Jefferson {{wrote of}} a plan he {{supported}} in 1779 in the Virginia legislature that would end slavery through the colonization of freed slaves. This plan was widely popular among the French people in 1785 who lauded Jefferson as a philosopher. According to Jefferson, this plan required enslaved adults to continue in slavery but <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> be taken from them and trained to have a skill in the arts or sciences. These skilled women at age 18 and men at 21 would be emancipated, given arms and supplies, and sent to colonize a foreign land. Jefferson believed that colonization was the practical alternative, while freed blacks living in a white American society {{would lead to a}} race war.|$|E
25|$|During the 18th Century, some Native American women {{turned to}} freed or runaway African men {{due to a}} major decline in the male {{population}} in Native American villages. At the same time, the early slave population in America was disproportionately male. Records show that some Native American women bought African men as slaves. Unknown to European sellers, the women freed and married the men into their tribe. Some African men chose Native American women as their partners because <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> be free, as the child's status followed that of the mother. The men could marry {{into some of the}} matrilineal tribes and be accepted, as their children were still considered to belong to the mother's people. As European expansion increased in the Southeast, African and Native American marriages became more numerous.|$|E
25|$|According to Marvin Harris, another {{anthropologist}} {{and among}} the first proponents of cultural materialism, these killings of legitimate children occurred only among the Rajputs and other elite land-owning and warrior groups. The rationale was mainly economic, lying in a desire not to split land and wealth among too many heirs and in avoiding the payment of dowries. Sisters and daughters would marry men of similar standing and thus pose {{a challenge to the}} cohesion of wealth and power, whereas concubines and <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> not and thus could be allowed to live. He further argues that the need for warriors in the villages of a pre-industrial society meant female children were devalued, and the combination of war casualties and infanticide acted as a necessary form of population control.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between children diagnosed with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) and the occurrence of frequent childhood ear infections. Other topics examined were whether parents engaged in preventative measures to reduce the risk that <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> develop ear infections, the impact of AD/HD on the child and the family, and if interventions controlled or reduced the symptoms of AD/HD. Utilizing historical and case study methodology, this study showed a relationship between frequent childhood ear infections and AD/HD. Additionally, parents did not intentionally use preventative measures to reduce the risk that <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> develop ear infections. Interventions to control the symptoms of AD/HD were utilized but did not appear to make a significant difference as children with AD/HD continued to present significant challenges for family members and teachers. The findings from this study are important. Parents should utilize early interventions and public schools should revise guidelines regarding hearing screenings as well as provide training on AD/HD for school personnel. Parents should participate in support groups and children who have AD/HD should have access to specialized school services and interventions...|$|R
50|$|SCS is {{the most}} common {{craniosynostosis}} syndrome and affects 1 in every 25,000 to 50,000 individuals. It occurs in all racial and ethnic groups, and affects males and females equally. If a parent carries a copy of the SCS gene mutation, then there is a 50% chance <b>their</b> <b>child</b> will also carry a copy of the gene mutation, in which case, the child may or may not show signs of SCS. There is also a 50% chance <b>their</b> <b>child</b> will have two working copies of the gene, and would therefore, not have SCS. If both parents carry a single copy of the SCS gene mutation, then there is a 25% chance <b>their</b> <b>child</b> will have two gene mutation copies (so <b>child</b> <b>would</b> develop severe SCS), a 25% chance <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> have two normal copies of the gene (so would be completely normal), and a 50% chance <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>would</b> carry one gene mutation copy and 1 normal copy (so child may or may not display SCS). In rare situations, two normal parents can have a child with SCS due to a de novo mutation. The exact cause of the de novo mutation is unknown, but it doesn't seem to be related to anything that the parents did or didn't do during the pregnancy. SCS due to a de novo mutation is so rare that the proportion of past cases is unknown.|$|R
25|$|During {{its time}} of {{existence}} the legal settlement that gives the rabbinical courts the monopoly on conducting the marriages and divorces of the entire Israeli Jewish population {{has been a source}} of great criticism from the secular public in Israel, but also to the ardent support from the religious public. The main argument of the supporters of the law is that its cancellation will divide the Jewish people in Israel between the Jews who would marry and divorce each other within the Jewish religious authorities and the Jews who would marry and divorce each other within the civil marriages—which would not be registered or inspected by the religious authorities, and thus <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> be considered illegitimate to marry the children of the couples married within the religious court, from fear of them being considered Mamzer. Opponents of the law see it as a severe offense to the human civil rights made by the state of Israel.|$|E
25|$|In November 1878, Pratt {{was ordered}} by the War Department {{to report to the}} Secretary of the Interior for Indian {{educational}} duty and then proceed to Dakota Territory to recruit Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota students for the new school. These tribe were selected on the principle of taking the most pains with those who resisted the United States the most. The order came less than three years after the Lakota and their allies defeated Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer and the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment in the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Pratt protested that he was not familiar with the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota, and they were in a hostile attitude toward the US Government. But the War Department was insistent that Pratt go to Red Cloud (Oglala) and Spotted Tail (Sicangu), important chiefs, because some military strategists believed <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> be hostages for the good behavior of their people. Pratt's speech to Spotted Tail convinced him to send his children to Carlisle.|$|E
25|$|According to the Christian Heritage Academy website, {{the school}} began in 1972 {{with a vision}} of Sunnyside Baptist Church and its pastor, Harry Boydstun. Prior to the school's founding, {{demographic}} changes in primary education were taking place in Oklahoma City and in other cities across America. In the 1971 Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education ruling, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of busing to end school segregation and dual school systems. The federal courts began mandating that enrollment be racially balanced {{in the public school}} systems and be achieved through the forced busing of elementary students. Many parents were alarmed that the public schools were being radically reorganized and <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> be transported miles across town to be taught in some other place than their neighborhood schools. The movement of large numbers of white families to suburbs of large cities, so-called white flight and a string of Supreme Court decisions, reduced the effectiveness of the busing policy.|$|E

25|$|Nearly each summer, Maria, Alexander and <b>their</b> <b>{{children}}</b> <b>would</b> make {{an annual}} trip to Denmark, where her parents, King Christian IX and Queen Louise, hosted family reunions. Maria's brother, King George I, and his wife, Queen Olga, {{would come up}} from Athens with their children, and the Princess of Wales, often without her husband, would come with some of her children from England. In contrast to the tight security observed in Russia, the tsar, tsarina and their children relished the relative freedom that they could enjoy at Bernstorff and Fredensborg. The annual family meetings of monarchs in Denmark was regarded as suspicious in Europe, where many assumed they secretly discussed state affairs. Bismarck nicknamed Fredensborg “Europe’s Whispering Gallery” and accused Queen Louise of plotting against him with her children. Maria also had {{a good relationship with}} the majority of her in-laws, and was often asked to act as a mediator between them and the tsar.

25|$|Ministerials were serfs, {{and as such}} {{could not}} move without {{expressed}} permission of their lord or lady, though in certain clergy lands they could take holy orders without permission. Ministerials were in many places forbidden to marry without permission, but other places upheld Galatians 3:28 that says no one may be denied a sacrament because of one's legal status. If a liege disliked any marriage, though, the liege could easily withdraw any lands or income held by his subject. Any marriage was subject to review or approval of the liege, as in Salzburg:In July 1213 Archbishop Eberhard II of Salzburg (1200–1246) and Bishop Manegold of Passau (1206–1215) asked King Frederick II at the imperial court held at Eger (today Cheb in the Czech Republic) to confirm the marriage contract that Gerhoch II of Bergheim-Radeck, an archiepiscopal ministerial, had made with Bertha of Lonsdorf, a Passau ministerial. The couple had agreed, presumably with their lords' consent, that their first two children were to belong to Salzburg and the third to Passau, and that any remaining children would be divided equally between the two churches.

Both Deans and Philip Nel point to the book's real-life implications for Geisel and his wife. Deans draws a connection between the elephant-bird in Horton and the Infantograph, a failed invention Geisel created that combined two photos and was meant to give couples an idea of what <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>would</b> look like.
