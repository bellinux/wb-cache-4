5|$|Peterborough {{sent two}} members to {{parliament}} {{for the first}} time in 1547. Before the civil war, many were relatives of the clergy; then for two hundred years after the restoration <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a Fitzwilliam, or a Fitzwilliam nominee, sitting as member for Peterborough, making it a Whig stronghold. Representation was reduced to one member under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.|$|E
5|$|The end {{of silent}} {{film in the}} West and in Japan was imposed by the {{industry}} and the market, not by any inner need or natural evolution.... Silent cinema was a highly pleasurable and fully mature form. It didn't lack anything, least in Japan, where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> the human voice doing the dialogues and the commentary. Sound films were not better, just more economical. As a cinema owner you didn't {{have to pay the}} wages of musicians and benshi any more. And a good benshi was a star demanding star payment.|$|E
5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became officials, {{they did not}} always {{see eye to eye}} with others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> the factor of competition with other officials. Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new officials often needed higher-ranking officials to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. Officials with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other officials for support, leading to pacts of rivaling officials lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E

5|$|Fitzgerald had {{no system}} {{to monitor the}} {{presence}} or amount of water in her cargo hold, even though <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> some present. The intensity of the November 10 storm {{would have made it}} difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water {{reached the top of the}} taconite cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo. The Marine Board noted that because Fitzgerald lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost freeboard (the level of a ship's deck above the water).|$|E
5|$|Mehldau {{was born}} on August 23, 1970, in Jacksonville, Florida. His father, Craig Mehldau, was a doctor, and his mother, Annette, was a homemaker. His sister, Leigh Anne, became a social worker. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a piano in the house during Mehldau's childhood, and he {{initially}} listened to pop and rock music on the radio. His family moved to West Hartford, Connecticut, when Mehldau was 10. Up to this point he had played mostly simple pop tunes and exercises from books, but the move brought him a new piano teacher, who introduced him to classical music. This new interest lasted for a few years, but {{by the age of}} 14 he was listening more to jazz, including recordings by saxophonist John Coltrane and pianist Oscar Peterson.|$|E

5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. When it rained <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E
5|$|British and French {{submarine}} {{operations in}} the Sea of Marmara were the one significant area of success of the Gallipoli Campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five gunboats, 11 troop transports, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels {{at a cost of}} eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in the Sea of Marmara. During the campaign <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> one British submarine in the Sea of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region. E2 left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles. By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease {{operations in the}} area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.|$|E
5|$|In the club's {{formative}} years, West Bromwich Albion {{were run}} by a seven-man playing committee, and funded by each member contributing a weekly subscription of 6d (six pence) (2½p). Albion's first chairman was Henry Jackson, appointed in 1885, with the club becoming a limited company in June 1891. Other early chairmen of Albion included Jem Bayliss and Billy Bassett, both of whom had earlier played for the club. Indeed, from 1878 to 1986 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> an Albion player or ex-player on the club's committee or board of directors. Bassett became an Albion director in 1905, following {{the resignation of the}} previous board in its entirety. The club was in deep financial trouble and had had a writ served upon them by their bank, but Bassett and returning chairman Harry Keys rescued the club, aided by local fund-raising activities. Bassett became chairman in 1908, and helped the club to avoid bankruptcy once more in 1910 by paying the players' summer wages from his own pocket. He remains Albion's longest-serving chairman, having held the position until his death in 1937. The club's longest-serving director was Major H. Wilson Keys, during the period 1930–1965, including 15 years as chairman. He became the FA's vice-president in 1969.|$|E

5|$|Traditional Chinese {{holidays}} such as Chinese New Year, Lantern Festival, Cold Food Festival, {{and others}} were universal holidays. In {{the capital city of}} Chang'an <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> lively celebration, especially for the Lantern Festival since the city's nighttime curfew was lifted by the government for three days straight. Between the years 628 and 758, the imperial throne bestowed a total of sixty-nine grand carnivals nationwide, granted by the emperor in the case of special circumstances such as important military victories, abundant harvests after a long drought or famine, the granting of amnesties, the installment of a new crown prince, etc. For special celebration in the Tang era, lavish and gargantuan-sized feasts were sometimes prepared, as the imperial court had staffed agencies to prepare the meals. This included a prepared feast for 1,100 elders of Chang'an in 664, a feast for 3,500 officers of the Divine Strategy Army in 768, and a feast for 1,200 women of the palace and members of the imperial family in the year 826. Drinking wine and alcoholic beverages was heavily ingrained into Chinese culture, as people drank for nearly every social event. A court official in the 8th century allegedly had a serpentine-shaped structure called the 'Ale Grotto' built with 50,000 bricks on the groundfloor that each featured a bowl from which his friends could drink.|$|E
5|$|When {{a member}} of the family died there were varying degrees of prostration and display of piety amongst family members, each one {{behaving}} differently according to the custom of kinship association with the deceased. There was to be no flashy or colorful attire while in the period of mourning, and proper funerary rituals were observed such as cleansing and clothing the deceased to rid him or her of impurities. This was one of the necessary steps in the observance of the deceased as one of the worshipped ancestors, which in turn raised the prestige of the family. Funerals were often expensive. A geomancer had to be consulted on where to bury the dead, caterers were hired to furnish the funeral banquet, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> the purchase of the coffin, which was burned along with paper images of horses, carriages, and servants in order for them to accompany the deceased into the next life. Due to the high cost of burial, most families opted for the cheaper practice of cremation. This was frowned upon by Confucian officials due to beliefs in the ancestral cult. They sought to ban the practice with prohibitions in 963 and 972; despite this, cremation amongst the poor and middle classes persisted. By the 12th century, the government came up with the solution of installing public cemeteries where a family's deceased could be buried on state owned property.|$|E
