5|$|Cernan {{turned down}} the {{opportunity}} {{to walk on the}} Moon as Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 16, preferring to risk missing a flight altogether for the opportunity to command his own mission. After the cancellation of Apollo 18, NASA decided to send a scientist, Harrison Schmitt, to the Moon. This decision meant the original Lunar Module (LM) pilot, Joe Engle, never had the opportunity to walk on the Moon. Cernan fought <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> crew together; however, public pressure from the scientific community cemented Schmitt's position on the crew. Even though Cernan wanted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>his</b> crew together, he had a positive evaluation of Schmitt's abilities. For example, he believed Schmitt was an outstanding LM pilot and that Engle was merely an adequate one.|$|E
