5|$|As {{a result}} of the Franco-Syrian War, <b>Turkey</b> annexed the southwestern Anatolian sanjaks (districts) that had been part of Aleppo Vilayet, such as Mar'ash, Gaziantep ('Ayntab), Rumkale (Qal'at Rum), Urfa (al-Ruha). These sanjaks became part of <b>Turkey</b> {{following}} the October 1921 treaty with France. Aleppans opposed the Turkish annexation. The Franco-Turkish treaty allowed for a resumption of commerce between Aleppo and the Alexandretta Sanjak, including Antioch, due to improved security conditions, but commerce between Aleppo and Anatolia largely ceased. Alexandretta was considered by Aleppans to be their port to the Mediterranean Sea and a crucial part of their socio-economic region. It remained part of Syria under French control, but was administered by a semi-autonomous government that was heavily influenced by <b>Turkey.</b> Aleppo's merchants and nationalist politicians feared this autonomy would ultimately lead to its annexation by <b>Turkey</b> and consequently precipitate an economic crisis in Aleppo; Alexnadretta was separated from Syria in 1938 and became part of <b>Turkey</b> in the following year.|$|E

40|$|Our {{analysis}} will discuss <b>Turkey’s</b> changing direction, if any, {{in terms of}} its trade orientation. This paper argues that <b>Turkey’s</b> trade sector has maintained its long-standing direction towards the major European Union (EU) member countries with only minor setbacks, while new dimensions in bilateral trade have emerged not only due to <b>Turkey’s</b> changing foreign policy considerations but also global economic transformations. Moreover, this paper argues that <b>Turkey’s</b> trade partners are subject to these changes, as the epicentre of the global economy shifts, i. e. to the East.

40|$|Wild <b>turkeys,</b> Meleagris gallopavo, {{are among}} the most ornamented birds in North America, {{displaying}} vividly coloured fleshy ornaments on their heads and bright, iridescent structural coloration in their plumage. We investigated the effect of experimental inoculation with coccidian parasites on the expression of iridescent structural coloration in yearling male <b>turkeys.</b> Prior to moult of ornamental feathers, we assigned <b>turkeys</b> to three experimental groups: we maintained six <b>turkeys</b> free of coccidial infection, inoculated four <b>turkeys</b> with a single species of coccidial oocysts, and inoculated six <b>turkeys</b> with multiple species of coccidial oocysts. We used reflectance spectrometry to quantify the plumage coloration of wing covert and breast feathers in the breeding plumage of males in each treatment protocol. We found significant treatment-based variation in the iridescent plumage coloration of yearling male <b>turkeys</b> such that infected males showed proportionately less UV reflectance in their wing covert and breast feathers and had duller breast feathers. This is the first experimental evidence that parasites can suppress the expression of structural plumage coloration, and our findings suggest that, in wild <b>turkeys,</b> iridescent coloration could serve as a condition-dependent signal of male health...|$|R
