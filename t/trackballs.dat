40|$|Interaction with 3 D {{objects and}} scenes is {{becoming}} increasingly important on mobile devices. We explore 3 D object rotation as a fundamental interaction task. We propose {{an extension of the}} virtual <b>trackball</b> metaphor, which is typically restricted to a half sphere and single-sided interaction, to actually use a full sphere. The extension is enabled by a hardware setup called the “iPhone Sandwich,” which allows for simultaneous front-and-back touch input. This setup makes the rear part of the virtual <b>trackball</b> accessible for direct interaction and thus achieves the realization of the virtual <b>trackball</b> metaphor to its full extent. We conducted a user study that shows that a back-of-device virtual <b>trackball</b> is as effective as a front-of-device virtual <b>trackball</b> and that both outperform an implementation of tilt-based input.

The prototype controller replaces the right analog stick of a standard game controller (used for pointing and camera control) with a <b>trackball.</b> To measure {{the performance of the}} three input devices, participants played two games. Penguin Hunt measured the number of target hits per minute, which was 28. 1 with the keyboard and mouse, 22. 9 with the <b>trackball</b> controller, and 21. 7 with the standard controller. Modern Warfare measured average completion times, which were 26. 8 s with the keyboard and mouse, 31. 8 s with the <b>trackball</b> controller and 35. 5 s with the standard controller.

40|$|Objective: This {{research}} examines individual dierences in {{the wrist}} postures adopted during {{the use of}} two pointing devices (mouse and <b>trackball).</b> Design: A multiple case study of twelve participants was employed. Background: The use of pointing devices may lead to musculoskeletal discomfort and injury {{as a consequence of}} prolonged exposure to postures involving wrist extension and ulnar deviation. Methods: Wrist flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation was measured while twelve participants completed two standardised tasks involving horizontal and vertical cursor movements respectively. Results: Exposure to extreme ulnar deviation and wrist extension was observed in the use of computer mouse and <b>trackball.</b> The <b>trackball</b> involved decreased ulnar deviation and increased wrist extension, however considerable individual dierences were ob-served. Conclusions: Some users may be placed at risk of injury by prolonged exposure to the use of such devices, while others may not. A <b>trackball</b> may reduce the exposure to extreme ulnar deviation, but in some cases, a <b>trackball</b> may increase exposure to extrem...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} two new six {{degree of}} freedom desktop input devices based on the key concept of combining forceless isotonic rotational input with force-requiring elastic translational input. The GlobeFish consists of a custom three degrees of freedom <b>trackball</b> which is elastically connected to a frame. The <b>trackball</b> is accessible from {{the top and bottom}} and can be moved slightly in all spatial directions by using force. The GlobeMouse device works in a similar way. Here the <b>trackball</b> is placed on top of a movable base, which requires to change the grip on the device to switch between rotating the <b>trackball</b> and moving the base. Our devices are manipulated with the fingertips allowing precise interaction with virtual objects. The elastic translation allows uniform input for all three axes and the isotonic <b>trackball</b> provides a natural mapping for rotations. Our user study revealed that the new devices perform significantly better in a docking task in comparison to the SpaceMouse, an integrated six degrees of freedom controller. Subjective data confirmed these results. Author Keywords User interface hardware, input devices, interactio...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} major {{extension}} to our previous work on <b>Trackball</b> EdgeWrite—a unistroke {{text entry method}} for trackballs—by taking it from a character-level technique to a word-level one. Our design is called stroke-based word completion, and it enables efficient word selection {{as part of the}} stroke-making process. Unlike most word completion designs, which require users to select words from a list, our technique allows users to select words by performing a fluid crossing gesture. Our theoretical model shows this word-level design to be 45. 0 % faster than our prior model for character-only strokes. A study with a subject with spinal cord injury comparing <b>Trackball</b> EdgeWrite to the onscreen keyboard WiViK, both using word prediction and completion, shows that <b>Trackball</b> EdgeWrite is competitive with WiViK in speed (12. 09 vs. 11. 82 WPM) and accuracy (3. 95 % vs. 2. 21 % total errors), but less visually tedious and ultimately preferred. The results also show that word-level <b>Trackball</b> EdgeWrite is 46. 5 % faster and 36. 7 % more accurate than our subject’s prior peak performance with character-level <b>Trackball</b> EdgeWrite, and 75. 2 % faster and 40. 2 % more accurate than his prior peak performance with his preferred on-screen keyboard.

5000|$|<b>Trackballs</b> have {{appeared}} in computer and video games, particularly early arcade games (see a List of trackball arcade games) notably Atari's Centipede and Missile Command - though Atari spelled it [...] "trak-ball". Football, by Atari, released in 1978, is commonly misunderstood {{to be the first}} arcade game to use a trackball, but in The Ultimate History of Video Games by Steven L. Kent the designer of Football, Dave Stubben, claims they copied the design from a Japanese game, Soccer (Taito, 1973). Console <b>trackballs,</b> now fairly rare, were common in the early 1980s: the Atari 2600 and 5200 consoles, as well as the competing ColecoVision console, though using a joystick as their standard controller, each had one as an optional peripheral. The Apple Pippin, a console introduced in 1996 had a trackball built into its gamepad as standard. <b>Trackballs</b> were occasionally used in e-sports prior to the mainstreaming of optical mice in the early 2000s because they were more reliable than ball mice, but now they are extremely rare because optical mice offer superior speed and precision. A trackball requires no mousepad and enables the player to aim swiftly (in first person shooters). <b>Trackballs</b> remain in use in pub golf machines (such as Golden Tee) to simulate swinging the club.|$|E
