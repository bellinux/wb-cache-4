5|$|Sophia's {{early life}} {{was focused on}} education. Lady Charlotte Finch served as her governess, a role she {{performed}} for all the royal children. As with the strict education and discipline received by her brothers, Lady Charlotte through the sub-governesses chosen by Queen Charlotte arranged expert tutors to give the princesses lessons in English, French, music, art, and geography; Sophia and her sisters were also allowed to play sports and boisterous games with <b>their</b> <b>brothers.</b> The queen sought to combine her daughters' entertainments with educational benefits. Sophia and her siblings were brought up with an exposure to theatre and were entertained with special performances. Princess Sophia's first appearance in public occurred when she accompanied her parents and elder siblings to a commemoration for George Frideric Handel, held at Westminster Abbey on 26 May 1784.|$|E

25|$|The {{increased}} paternity seen in V. acadica {{leads to}} a lower relatedness between worker and their sisters, but not between workers and <b>their</b> <b>brothers.</b> These discrepancies are important in determining the allocation of resources made by workers to each sex. Estimates of sex ratios indicate that near equal numbers {{of males and females}} are produced. However, the queens are much larger in size than males which suggests sex allocation is biased towards females in a significant ratio.|$|E
25|$|Customary laws favoured men {{more than}} women. For example, {{inheritance}} among the elites in Italy, England, Scandinavia and France was {{passed on to}} the eldest male heir. In all of the regions, the laws also gave men substantial powers over lives, property and bodies of their wives. However, there were some improvements for women as opposed to ancient custom for example they could inherit in the absence of <b>their</b> <b>brothers,</b> do certain trades without their husbands and widows to receive dower.|$|E

25|$|In {{autumn of}} 704, there {{began to be}} accusations of {{corruption}} levied against Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, as well as <b>their</b> <b>brothers</b> Zhang Changqi, Zhang Changyi, and Zhang Tongxiu (張同休). Zhang Tongxiu and Zhang Changyi were demoted, but even though the officials Li Chengjia (李承嘉) and Huan Yanfan advocated that Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong be removed as well, Wu Zetian, taking the suggestion of the chancellor Yang Zaisi, did not remove them. Subsequently, charges of corruption against Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were renewed by the chancellor Wei Anshi.|$|E
25|$|In 1973, Märtha Louise's {{younger brother}} was born Haakon Magnus. In 1990 the Norwegian {{constitution}} was altered, granting full cognatic primogeniture to the Norwegian throne, {{meaning that the}} eldest child, regardless of gender, takes precedence {{in the line of}} succession. This change only affects those born in 1990 or later. Females born between 1971 and 1990 (i.e. only Märtha Louise), were given succession rights, but <b>their</b> <b>brothers</b> would be before them in the line of succession, meaning that Prince Haakon still took precedence over Märtha Louise in the line of succession.|$|E
25|$|With {{the first}} Canadian chapter only founded at Toronto in 1879, her sister {{chapters}} were still young when war came to them. Particularly stricken were the Alpha Psi and Theta Xi chapters at McGill and U Toronto. Even in 1914, {{they were already}} sending letters indicating <b>their</b> <b>brothers</b> heading east across the sea to the war. In 1915, {{more than half the}} workers at the McGill Base Hospital were Zetes from Alpha Psi. By war's end, the two beleaguered chapters had sent two hundred of the brothers in defense of King and Country, 31 did not return and many others came home wounded in body and spirit.|$|E

25|$|Because {{relatedness}} differs in haplodiploid species, {{the effects}} of kin selection are predicted to differ {{from that of a}} diploid species. V. pensylvanica is a haplodiploid species. Thus, female offspring have a 0.75 relatedness to their sisters, but only a 0.25 relatedness to <b>their</b> <b>brothers.</b> As a result, kin selection posits that workers will be more inclined to show altruistic behavior toward sisters than brothers. Further, this implies that a conflict over sex ratio may result, with workers preferring their mothers to have daughters. Because the mother is related equally to sons and daughters, kin selection predicts the mother will not show a preference toward either sex.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} consequences of the Secular Franciscan charism is that the spiritual formation of the OFS must cater for those whose vocation is, motivated by the dynamic power of the Gospel, to live in secular circumstances. Intimate union with Christ {{lies at the heart of}} the OFS vocation. Therefore, Secular Franciscans should seek to encounter the living and active person of Christ in <b>their</b> <b>brothers</b> and sisters, in Sacred Scripture, in the Church and in liturgical activity. They do this by studying, loving and most of all by living in an integrated way the human and evangelical aspects of their life.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} Byzantine {{record of}} the Rus' may have been written prior to 842. It is preserved in the Greek Life of St. George of Amastris, which speaks of a raid that had extended into Paphlagonia. Contemporary Byzantine presence of the Rus' is mentioned in the Frankish Annals of St. Bertin. These relate that a delegation from the court of the Byzantine emperor visited Frankish Emperor Louis the Pious at his court in Ingelheim in 839. In this delegation were two men who called themselves Rhos (Rhos vocari dicebant). Louis enquired about their origins and learnt that they were Swedes. Fearing that they were spies for <b>their</b> <b>brothers,</b> the Danes, he incarcerated them.|$|E

25|$|Colonies of P. gallicus {{have one}} queen that mates and {{produces}} offspring. All females, both workers and queens, {{are capable of}} producing male offspring, and have a genetic incentive to do so; mother-to-son relatedness is 1/2, while the relatedness of a worker to her brothers is 1/4. If the queen has only been mated once, then worker's relatedness to the male offspring of other workers is 3/8, meaning workers should favor male production by themselves and their sisters over production by the queen. However, in {{the case that the}} queen mates more than once, workers are actually more related to <b>their</b> <b>brothers</b> than compared to the offspring of other workers (a mixture of full and half sisters).|$|E
25|$|Conflict often {{develops}} between queens {{and workers}} of haplodiploid species because workers are more {{related to their}} sisters than <b>their</b> <b>brothers</b> or daughters. This results in them trying to push the sex ratio {{so that there are}} more females produced by the queen than males. At the same time, however, it is best for the queen to keep a 1:1 ratio of male and female offspring because she is equally related to both. D. media workers and queens have been observed policing worker laid eggs which helps to push the ratio more towards the females. This may help to keep worker-queen conflict from getting worse since workers do not produce many offspring in the nest.|$|E
25|$|In May 1525, King James V of Scotland {{recommended}} Campbell's {{appointment as}} Abbot of Coupar Angus, a recommendation confirmed by parliament {{in the following}} year - {{despite the fact that the}} monks of Coupar Angus Abbey had already elected one of <b>their</b> <b>brothers,</b> Alexander Spens, to the position in early 1524. In September 1529, the papacy agreed that Campbell could hold the abbey for eight months in commendam, providing that if he did not become a monk in this period the abbey would thereafter be regarded as vacant; the following February, 1530, he received an eight-month extension to this. Campbell seems to have complied, and was in France in the following months.|$|E
