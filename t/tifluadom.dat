40|$|The {{effects of}} a series of opiold drugs on urine output in the water-loaded rat were studied and also the block of those effects by the {{irreversible}} opiold receptor antagonist, j 3 -funaltrexamine (8 -FNA). Fentanyl, d-propoxyphene, profadol, bromadoline, bu-prenorphine and nalbuphine produced only a decrease in unne output, which was antagonised by pretreatment with $-FNA, 40 mg/kg s. c., 24 hr beforehand.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{and biological}} {{evaluation of a}} series of 2 -substitued 5 -phenyl- 1, 4 -benzodiazepines, structurally related to <b>tifluadom</b> (5), the only benzodiazepine that acts simultaneously as a kappa-opioid agonist and a cholecystokinin-A (CCK-A) antagonist, are reported. The radioligand binding models used in these studies were [I- 125 (BH) -CCK- 8 in rat pancreas (CCK-A), [H- 3]-(MeNLE(28, 31)) -CCK- 8 in guinea pig cerebral cortex (CCK-B), and [H- 3]U- 69593 (kappa(1)), [H- 3]DAMGO (mu), and [H- 3]DADLE (delta) in guinea pig brain. All the title compounds were devoid of significant affinity for both CCK-A and CCK-B receptors, while some of them bound with nanomolar affinity and high selectivity for kappa-opioid receptors. In particular, the 2 -thienyl derivative 7 a (X = H) with a K-i = 0. 50 nM represents a clear improvement with respect to <b>tifluadom,</b> showing a comparable potency but higher selectivity. The application of computational simulations and linear regression analysis techniques to the complexes between guinea pig kappa (kappa(1)) -receptor and the title compounds allowed the identification of the structural determinants for recognition and quantitative elucidation of the structure-affinity relationships in this class of receptors...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of opiates acting {{preferentially}} on mu receptors, like morphine, methadone and fentanyl (mu agonists) and on kappa receptors, like U 50, 488, bremazocine and <b>tifluadom</b> (kappa agonists) on the release of dopamine (DA) and of its metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid, from the nucleus accumbens and from the dorsal caudate of freely moving rats using brain dialysis coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Spontaneous behavior was videotaped and analyzed by estimating the percentage of time spent by the animals in performing certain specific behavioral items. Mu agonists stimulated DA-release and metabolism in the accumbens at lower doses than in the caudate. Maximal stimulation of DA release did not exceed 100 % except after high doses of methadone (10 mg/kg) which stimulated DA release in the accumbens by more than 300 %, possibly {{as a result of}} hypoxia. Stimulation of DA release was associated to stimulation of behavior at low doses and to a biphasic inhibitory-stimulatory syndrome after higher doses of the opiates. Pretreatment with low doses of naloxone (0. 1 mg/kg s. c.) or with the irreversible mu antagonist beta-funaltrexamine (10 nmol i. c. v.) increased the ED 50 for the stimulation of DA release by the three opiates. In contrast with mu agonists, agonists of kappa receptors like U 50, 488, bremazocine and <b>tifluadom</b> decreased DA release in the accumbens and in the caudate and reduced motor activity. These effects were antagonized only by rather high doses of naloxone (2. 5 mg/kg s. c.) and were not affected by pretreatment with beta-funaltrexamine (10 nmol i. c. v.).

40|$|By {{selectively}} blocking cross-interferences {{from other}} types of binding sites, a binding site which likely represents kappa opiold binding sites was obtained in the guinea-pig brain suspension of the particulate fraction. Selective ligands for mu, sigma, delta and epsilon opioid binding sites were poor inhibitors for inhibiting [3 H]ethylketocyclazocine binding to this site, whereas kappa opiolds like oxilorphan, dynorphin(I- 1 3), ethylketocyclazocine, butorphanol, cyclazocane, ketocydazocine, <b>tifluadom,</b> nalor-phine, pentazocine, U- 50 - 488, nalbuphine and naloxone were potent ligands. Buprenorphine, generally {{believed to be a}} mu opiate, was the most potent inhibitor at the kappa site. Scatchard analysis of the saturation curve of[3 H]ethylketocydazocine bind-ing revealed two subtypes of kappa binding sites: a high-affinity site and a low-affinity site wfth K = 0. 7 and 78 nM and maximum binding = 22 and 1 01 frnol/mg of protein, respectively.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{irreversible}} opioid receptor antagonist, beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA), on antinociception produced by mu- and kappa-receptor agonists was studied in the rat. beta-FNA, 20 to 80 mg kg- 1, s. c., given 24 h before testing, produced a dose-related antagonism {{of the effects of}} morphine in the paw pressure, hotplate and tail-flick tests. Following the 80 mg kg- 1 dose, the degree of antagonism of morphine was stable for up to 48 h after dosing, but was reduced by 5 days and had disappeared by 8 days. In the paw pressure test, beta-FNA, 40 mg kg- 1, s. c., antagonized the effects of fentanyl, buprenorphine, <b>tifluadom,</b> ethylketocyclazocine and proxorphan; it was without effect against the highly selective kappa-agonist, U- 50, 488. In light of these results, the possible opioid receptor selectivities of both the agonists and beta-FNA are reassessed...|$|E
40|$|Intracellular {{records were}} made from neurones in the submucous plexus of the {{guinea-pig}} caecum. [Met 5]enkephalin, [Leu 5]enkephalin, [D-Ala 2,D-Leu 5]enkephalin (DADLE) and [D-Ser 2,Leu 5]enkephalin-Thr (DSLET) hyperpolarized the membrane when applied in concentrations of 30 nm- 10 microM. Normorphine, [D-Ala 2, MePhe 4,Gly 5]enkephalin-ol (DAGO), [D-Ala 2,MePhe 4,Met(0) 5]enkephalin-ol (FK 33824), dynorphin A and <b>tifluadom</b> had no effect at concentrations up to 10 microM. The hyperpolarization resulted from {{an increase in the}} membrane potassium conductance. Hyperpolarizations induced by [Met 5]enkephalin were antagonized competitively by naloxone and by N-bisallyl[aminoisobutyrate 2, 3, Leu 5]enkephalin (ICI 174864). The Schild plots for these antagonisms had slopes not different from one, and the dissociation equilibrium constants among individual neurones were 5 - 50 nM for naloxone and 5 - 60 nM for ICI 174864.

40|$|Kappa {{receptor}} multiplicity is {{a complex}} area. We now present evidence from binding studies suggesting the existence of four kappa receptor subtypes. The guinea pig cerebellum contains high levels of U 50, 488 -sensitive, or,, receptors. Kappa opiates (U 50, 488, <b>tifluadom,</b> Mr 2034, Mr 2266 and Win 44, 441) compote [3 H]ethylketocyclazocine binding to ‘c receptors with K, values under 1 0 nM and Hill coefficients of approximately one, as does dynorphin A (K,, 0. 27 ± 0. 05 nM; Hill coefficient, 0. 83 ± 0. 20, n = 4). However, competition studies with dynorphin B yield a Hill coefficient of 0. 46 ± 0. 03 (n = 5) and nonlinear regression analysis of the competition curve is best fit by two sites. a-Neoendorphin competition curves (Hill coefficient, 0. 46 ± 0. 07; n = 3) also were best fit with two components.

40|$|In {{conscious}} saline loaded rats, the kappa-opioid agonists <b>tifluadom,</b> U 50488, and ethylketocyclazocine, given subcutaneously, induced {{a characteristic}} diuresis {{which could be}} antagonized by naloxone. Bilateral adrenal demedullation significantly reduced adrenal gland catecholamine content and plasma adrenaline levels, but did not significantly affect plasma corticosterone levels, indicating that the adrenal cortex remained both intact and functional. Seven days following bilateral adrenal demedullation, the subcutaneous administration of the kappa-agonists no longer induced diuresis. However, demedullation {{did not affect the}} diuretic response to frusemide or clonidine, nor did it affect the antidiuretic response induced by the mu-opioid agonists morphine and buprenorphine. Adrenal catecholamines {{do not appear to be}} involved in kappa-opioid-induced diuresis, since pretreatment with propranolol, prazosin and idazoxan did not affect the diuretic response in intact animals. The results indicate a link between the adrenal medulla and kappa-opioid-induced diuresis and suggest that a peripheral mechanism may also be involved in mediating this effect...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} {{and biological}} {{evaluation of a}} series of new derivatives of 2 -substituted 5 -phenyl- 1, 4 -benzodiazepines, structurally related to <b>tifluadom</b> (5), are reported. Chemical and pharmacological studies on compounds 6 have been pursued with the aim of expanding the SAR data and validating the previously proposed model of interaction of this class of compounds with the kappa-opioid receptor. The synthesis of the previously described compounds 6 has been reinvestigated in order to obtain a more direct synthetic procedure. To study the relationship between the stereochemistry and the receptor binding affinity, compounds 6 e and 6 k were {{selected on the basis of}} their evident structural resemblance to <b>tifluadom.</b> Since a different specificity of action could be expected for the enantiomers of 6 e and 6 k, owing to the results shown by (S) - and (R) -tifluadom, their racemic mixtures have been resolved by means of liquid chromatography with chiral stationary phases (CSP), and the absolute configuration of the enantiomers has been studied by circular dichroism (CD) and H- 1 NMR techniques. Moreover, some new 2 -[(acylamino) ethyl]- 1, 4 -benzodiazepine derivatives, 6 a-d,f,g,j, have been synthesized, while the whole series (6 a-o) has been tested for its potential affinity toward human cloned kappa-opioid receptor. The most impressive result obtained from the binding studies lies in the fact that this series of 2 -[2 -(acylamino) ethyll- 1, 4 -benzodiazepine derivatives binds the human cloned kappa-opioid receptor subtype very tightly. Indeed, almost all the ligands within this class show subnanomolar K-i values, and the least potent compound 6 o shows, in any case, an affinity in the nanomolar range. A comparison of the affinities obtained in human cloned kappa-receptor with the correspondent one obtained in native guinea pig kappa-receptor suggests that the human cloned kappa-receptor is less effective in discriminating the substitution pattern than the native guinea pig kappa-receptor. Furthermore, the results obtained are discussed with respect to the interaction with the homology model of the human kappa-opioid receptor, built on the recently solved crystal structure of rhodopsin. Finally, the potential antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of compounds 6 e and 6 i have been investigated by means of the hot-plate and passive avoidance test in mice, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of adenylate cyclase in striatal membrane-enriched fractions (25, 000 g) was inhibited by morphine, beta-endorphin, [D-Ala 2 -D-Leu 5] enkephalin (DADLenk), fentanyl and bremazocine. Whereas guanosine triphosphate (GTP) appeared {{essential for the}} expression of this effect, sodium chloride seemed to enhance the degree of inhibition. Dopamine stimulation and sodium fluoride activation of the enzyme was also suppressed by morphine, beta-endorphin and DADLenk. beta-Endorphin and DADLenk inhibited adenylate cyclase activity in vasa deferentia membrane-enriched fractions (25, 000 g); both opioids required GTP and NaCl and were inhibited by a delta-opioid receptor antagonist and by naloxone. Morphine, bremazocine and <b>tifluadom</b> did not significantly alter the {{activity of}} the vas deferens enzyme. Basal cyclic AMP values of striatal slices were not significantly altered by morphine, beta-endorphin or DADLenk. However, dopamine-induced elevation of cyclic AMP was reduced by morphine and this effect of the opiate was suppressed by naloxone. Only beta-endorphin lowered the basal cyclic AMP values in the vas deferens. The physiological relevance of adenylate cyclase coupling to opioid receptor subtypes is considered...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{drugs on the}} {{extracellular}} concentration of dopamine in two terminal dopaminergic areas, the nucleus accumbens septi (a limbic area) and the dorsal caudate nucleus (a subcortical motor area), was studied in freely moving rats by using brain dialysis. Drugs abused by humans (e. g., opiates, ethanol, nicotine, amphetamine, and cocaine) increased extracellular dopamine concentrations in both areas, but especially in the accumbens, and elicited hypermotility at low doses. On the other hand, drugs with aversive properties (e. g., agonists of kappa opioid receptors, U- 50, 488, <b>tifluadom,</b> and bremazocine) reduced dopamine release in the accumbens and in the caudate and elicited hypomotility. Haloperidol, a neuroleptic drug, increased extracellular dopamine concentrations, but this effect was not preferential for the accumbens and was associated with hypomotility and sedation. Drugs not abused by humans [e. g., imipramine (an antidepressant), atropine (an antimuscarinic drug), and diphenhydramine (an antihistamine) ] failed to modify synaptic dopamine concentrations. These results provide biochemical evidence for the hypothesis that stimulation of dopamine transmission in the limbic system might be a fundamental property of drugs that are abused...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} opioid {{agonists}} on veratrine-stimulated Ca 2 + influx and amino acid neurotransmitter release in rat cerebrocortical brain slices were studied. Inhibitory effects were seen {{on both of}} these parameters {{with all of the}} opioid agonists used. None of the drugs used affected basal 45 Ca 2 + uptake, basal K+ content or basal amino acid release from the slices. At high concentrations (100 microM) fentanyl, <b>tifluadom,</b> U 50, 488 H, butorphanol and bremazocine greatly inhibited the depolarization of the slices by veratrine as determined by the reduced release of K+. The opioid receptor subtypes at which the drugs were acting were characterized by the antagonistic effects of naloxone and WIN 44441 - 3. The opioid-induced inhibition of stimulated Ca 2 + uptake and amino acid release were not antagonized by WIN 44441 - 2, the inactive enantiomer of WIN 44441 - 3. It is concluded that opioid agonists acting through mu- and kappa-receptors and probably through delta- and sigma-receptors, have an inhibitory effect on Ca 2 + uptake into cerebrocortical brain slices and the subsequent release of aspartate, glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{actions of}} various opioids were {{examined}} on calcium action potentials {{in the cell}} somata of guinea pig myenteric neurones and on the release of acetylcholine at synapses onto these cells. The opioids morphine, normorphine, and [D-Ala 2, MePhe 4, Met 5 (O) ]enkephalin-ol caused membrane hyperpolarizations resulting from an increase in potassium conductance; opioids that are more selective agonists for the kappa receptor subtype (dynorphin, <b>tifluadom,</b> U 50488 H) did not. Conversely, calcium action potentials were depressed or abolished by the kappa opioids but were not affected by morphine and [D-Ala 2, MePhe 4, Met(O) 5]enkephalin-ol. Both groups of opioids caused presynaptic inhibition of acetylcholine release in the myenteric plexus, depressing the amplitude of the fast excitatory postsynaptic potential. The presynaptic inhibition caused by [D-Ala 2, MePhe 4, Met(O) 5]enkephalin-ol, morphine, and normorphine, but not that caused by the kappa opioids, was prevented by pretreatment with the selective mu site-directed irreversible antagonist beta-funaltrexamine. Furthermore, the presynaptic inhibitory action of morphine and [D-Ala 2, MePhe 4, Met(O) 5]enkephalin-ol, but not that of the kappa-receptor agonists, was reversibly blocked by barium. The results suggest that presynaptic inhibition caused by mu receptor activation probably results from an increase in potassium conductance, whereas kappa-receptor agonists may depress the release of acetylcholine by directly reducing calcium entry into the nerve terminals...|$|E
40|$|The {{irreversible}} inhibitor of mu-opioid receptor-mediated effects, beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA), {{was used}} to investigate the selectivity of various opioid agonists at mu-opioid receptors in the electrically stimulated guinea-pig ileum and mouse vas deferens preparations in vitro. In the guinea-pig ileum, pretreatment with beta-FNA (3 X 10 (- 8) - 3 X 10 (- 6) M) produced a concentration-dependent antagonism of the inhibitory effect produced by the mu-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala 2, MePhe 4, Gly(ol) 5]enkephalin (DAGO). High concentrations of beta-FNA (3 X 10 (- 6) - 1 X 10 (- 5) M) also antagonized the inhibitory effects of the kappa-opioid agonist U 50488. Pretreatment of guinea-pig ileum with beta-FNA at 1 X 10 (- 6) M resulted in blockade {{of the effect of}} some opioid agonists. The compounds which showed the largest rightward shifts in their concentration-response curves, and hence the greatest mu/kappa opioid receptor selectivity, were nalbuphine, [D-Ser 2, Leu 5]enkephalinyl-Thr 6 (DSLET), morphine, DAGO and normorphine. Responses to <b>tifluadom,</b> Mr 2034, ethylketocyclazocine, butorphanol, nalorphine, proxorphan and U 50488 were not inhibited by beta-FNA. In the mouse vas deferens, pre-treatment with beta-FNA (1 X 10 (- 6) M) produced a similar shift in the dose-response curves for normorphine as in the guinea-pig ileum. The concentration-response curves for the delta-receptor agonists [D-Ala 2, D-Leu 5] enkephalin (DADLE) and DSLET were, however, also shifted, indicating that beta-FNA will also block delta-opioid receptors. Since beta-FNA does not block kappa-opioid receptor-mediated effects, it can be used in the guinea-pig ileum preparation as a selective mu-receptor inhibitor. However, its lack of selectivity between mu- and delta-opioid receptors should be taken into account in many other isolated tissues and experiments in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Spinal {{reflexes}} in {{the rabbit}} are suppressed tonically by endogenous opioids. The contributions made to this suppression by mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors {{have been investigated}} by studying {{the actions of a}} range of opioid antagonists and agonists on reflexes evoked by sural nerve stimulation in the ankle extensor gastrocnemius medialis (g. m.), and in the knee flexor semitendinosus (s. t.). When given at a total dose of 88. 5 micrograms kg- 1 i. v., either of the universal opioid receptor antagonists (-) -naloxone and (-) -quadazocine enhanced the g. m. response to more than 7 times the pre-drug control values, and the s. t. reflex to 1. 5 times controls. The effects of quadazocine were stereospecific. The selective delta antagonist ICI 174864 (3. 5 mg kg- 1 i. v. total) also augmented the g. m. reflex but only to twice pre-drug controls. The mu-agonists fentanyl (100 micrograms kg- 1) and morphine (50 mg kg- 1) suppressed both g. m. and s. t. reflex responses to less than half control levels by a naloxone-reversible mechanism. The kappa-agonists bremazocine (50 micrograms kg- 1 total), <b>tifluadom</b> (100 micrograms kg- 1), ethylketocyclazocine (200 micrograms kg- 1) and U 50488 H (1 mg kg- 1) potentiated the g. m. reflex and had variable effects on the s. t. response. Naloxone usually added to the facilitatory actions of these drugs. kappa-Opioid receptor agonists also caused a profound, naloxone-reversible depression of arterial blood pressure. It may be concluded that the endogenous opioid-mediated suppression of spinal reflexes in the rabbit is mediated mainly, if not exclusively, through mu-receptors. There are no known endogenous ligands which are specific for the mu-receptor, so in the present case it seems that selectivity is determined by the receptor population rather than by the ligand...|$|E
