During this time, Mitchell was unavailable for commitments made by Jeffery, which included Hendrix's first appearance on U.S. TV—on The Dick Cavett Show—where he was backed by the studio orchestra, and an appearance on The Tonight Show where he appeared with Cox and session drummer Ed Shaughnessy.|$|E
5|$|Special {{technical}} solutions had to {{be designed}} for <b>the</b> <b>accommodations</b> for three adults to be confined in a small balloon basket for up to 30 days. The sleeping berths for the crew were fitted at {{the floor of the}} basket, along with some of stores and provisions. The highly flammable hydrogen meant that cooking could not be done in the basket itself. The solution was a modified primus stove (designed by a friend of Andrée's) that could be dangled 8m (26ft) below the crew and then lit from the basket, at a safe distance. An angled mirror attached to the specially designed stove allowed the crew to determine whether it was successfully lit or not.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper deck}} housed {{facilities}} for officers and first- and second-class passengers. A long forecastle contained <b>the</b> <b>accommodations</b> {{for the crew}} and petty officers, {{as well as a}} hospital and the third-class lavatories. First-class staterooms for 106 passengers were located close {{to the middle of the}} ship. To their rear, between the funnels, was the first-class passenger dining room, spanning the width of the ship. With seating for 208, it featured mahogany furniture and satinwood paneling with inlays, and a glass skylight ceiling that extended up through two decks. Beyond this area were the galleys, sculleries, and pantries that served all passenger classes. Moving further aft, the second-class passenger dining room, which could accommodate 120 diners, was next. It, too, spanned the width of the ship and featured mahogany furniture, but was paneled with tapestry upon a cream-colored ground. Beyond the dining area were cabins for 76 second-class passengers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlthough contour rivalry {{is known}} to {{suppress}} {{the contribution of the}} non-dominant eye to some visuomotor mechanisms such as the pupillary light reflex, there have been no reports of the impact of rivalry on <b>accommodation</b> control. In <b>the</b> situation where <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> demands in <b>the</b> two eyes are in dynamic conflict, {{it has been reported that}} <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> response can be modelled in terms of a vector average of the appropriate response in the two eyes. This study compared the binocular interactions in <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> system with rivalrous and non-rivalrous stimuli. Accommodation was continuously monitored with an infrared optometer, while <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> demand in <b>the</b> two eyes was dynamically modulated independently in the two eyes. When the visual target was perceptually rivalrous the previously described binocular interactions were abolished and <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> response closely followed <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> demand presented to the dominant eye.

40|$|The {{influence}} of gas-surface interactions of a dilute gas confined between two parallel walls on the heat flux predictions is investigated using a combined Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) approach. <b>The</b> <b>accommodation</b> coefficients are computed from {{the temperature of}} incident and reflected molecules in molecular dynamics and used as effective coefficients in Maxwell-like boundary conditions in Monte Carlo simulations. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic wall interactions are studied, {{and the effect of}} the gas-surface interaction potential on the heat flux and other characteristic parameters like density and temperature is shown. The heat flux dependence on <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> coefficient is shown for different fluid-wall mass ratios. We find that <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> coefficient is increasing considerably when the mass ratio is decreased. An effective map of the heat flux depending on <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> coefficient is given and we show that MC heat flux predictions using Maxwell boundary conditions based on <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> coefficient give good results when compared to pure molecular dynamics heat predictions. <b>The</b> <b>accommodation</b> coefficients computed for a dilute gas for different gas-wall interaction parameters and mass ratios are transferred to compute the heat flux predictions for a dense gas. Comparison of the heat fluxes derived using explicit MD, MC with Maxwell-like boundary conditions based on <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> coefficients, and pure Maxwell boundary conditions are discussed. A map of the heat flux dependence on <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> coefficients for a dense gas, and <b>the</b> effective <b>accommodation</b> coefficients for different gas-wall interactions are given. In the end, this approach is applied to study the gas-surface interactions of argon and xenon molecules on a platinum surface. <b>The</b> derived <b>accommodation</b> coefficients are compared with values of experimental results...|$|R

25|$|Coincidentally {{there was}} a circus in Charlottetown during the conference, and {{it was much more}} {{interesting}} to the majority of the population. There was no one working at the public wharf at the foot of Great George Street when the Canadian delegates arrived on the steamship SS Victoria, so Prince Edward Island representative William Henry Pope had to handle receptions by himself, including rowing out to greet the new arrivals.

25|$|In a {{proposal}} to the Port of Portland, the west channel of the Willamette River next to Swan Island {{would have to be}} widened, and a dike built to keep high water out. The project extended its timeline in May 1926, forcing the USPS to keep using Pearson Airfield in Vancouver to deliver mail to the city. Most of <b>the</b> <b>accommodations</b> for the USPS at Swan Island Municipal Airport opened in September 1926, but commercial services were still being readied. The airfield only took-up a fraction of the land on Swan Island. The other areas were cleared and leveled so industrial growth could take place. During its construction, the Port of Portland requested that the Swan Island Municipal Airport be the future site of the Pacific Coast Air Derby, which was approved.|$|E
25|$|While the {{compromise}} {{was a success}} for the residents of Wheatley Hills, according to Robert Caro in The Power Broker, the $175,000 was a smokescreen {{for the fact that}} the land purchasing would cost $2.25million (1929USD) and rather than the locals, the taxpayers would be stuck with the majority (over 90%) of the bill from the acquisition. The $175,000 also was claimed by Moses to have been spending for the entire cost of the detour, rather than the land acquisition. Caro goes on to explain that <b>the</b> <b>accommodations</b> made for the citizens of Wheatley Hills denied Long Islanders some of the parks on the North Shore that had been proposed by Moses, pardoning Caumsett State Park. Caro also explained that along with the $10,000 bribe that Moses had accepted, the illegal purchases of the Taylor Estate would turn him into a beating stick for the politicians of New York to get him to stop fighting.|$|E

25|$|With {{the first}} of the new {{commuter}} cars in service on the Burlington the next railroad that approached Budd to design of new type of car with a greater seating capacity while also improving <b>the</b> <b>accommodations</b> for coach passengers was the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The Santa Fe was searching for a better design for its long distance passenger trains and, with the design of the Burlington coaches in mind Budd set out to create a similar passenger car design to meet the Santa Fe's needs. In September 1952 the Santa Fe placed an order for two two-level prototypes, Budd's Lot 9679-129. The two coaches carrying the numbers 526 and 527 were delivered in July 1954, at which time both were placed into service for evaluation. These two prototypes had seating on the both levels, stairs on one end to provide access to single-level cars, a stairway {{at the center of the}} car for access to toilets on the lower level, as well as the door in the side of the car for embarking and departing passengers. This lower floor also contained various mechanical and pneumatic equipment that otherwise would be mounted below the floors of single-level cars.|$|E
25|$|Little {{investment}} in private homes or businesses {{took place in}} the neighborhood between 1911 and the 1990s. However, the unwillingness of landlords elsewhere in the city to rent to black tenants, together with {{a significant increase in the}} black population of New York, meant that rents in Harlem were for many years higher than rents elsewhere in the city, even as the housing stock decayed. In 1920, one-room apartments in central Harlem rented for $40 to whites or $100–$125 to blacks. In the late 1920s, a typical white working-class family in New York paid $6.67 per month per room, while blacks in Harlem paid $9.50 for the same space. The worse <b>the</b> <b>accommodations</b> and more desperate the renter, the higher the rents would be. This pattern persisted through the 1960s; in 1965, CERGE reported that a one-room apartment in Harlem rented for $50–$74, while comparable apartments rented for $30–$49 in white slums. The high rents encouraged some property speculators to engage in block busting, a practice whereby they would acquire a single property on a block and sell or rent it to blacks with great publicity. Other landowners would panic, and the speculators would then buy additional houses relatively cheaply. These houses could then be rented profitably to blacks.|$|E
25|$|Diseases such as typhus or cholera {{appeared}} very quickly. The close confinement of <b>the</b> <b>accommodations</b> and {{the number}} of prisoners per barrack, on average 250, partly explains the phenomenon, as the foul air circulated very little. An official policy of integration of different nationalities mean that typhus tended to spread rapidly from Russian troops, among whom it was endemic, to the French and British who had little immunity to it. In February 1915, the camp at Chemnitz was placed under quarantine; one prisoner wrote that the only vehicles approaching the camp were those transporting coffins. Serious outbreaks of typhus occurred at the camps at Wittenberg, Gardelegen, Cassel and Cottbus, among others: at Cassel, for example, of 18,300 prisoners, there were 7,218 cases of typhus, with a mortality rate of 11 per cent. In November 1915, a circular from the war ministry was sent to the various camps to put in place rules of hygiene. The fight against lice was at the centre of measures to be taken by using hair-removing creams and disinfecting rooms. Vaccines were also ordered, and a vaccination frenzy ensued. For instance, Charles Gueugnier was vaccinated against typhus on 28 September 1915, only to be re-vaccinated on 2 and 7 October. At Merseburg camp, the blankets were de-loused {{for the first time on}} 5 June 1915.|$|E
40|$|In {{sedimentary}} basins, {{a better}} understanding of the controlling effect of accommodation/transfer zones on stratal architecture and facies distribution can improve the success rate of locating hydrocarbon reservoirs. The Fushan Depression is a half-graben rift sub-basin located in the southeast of the Beibuwan Basin, South China Sea. In this study, comparative analysis of seismic reflection, palaeogeomorphology, fault activity and depositional facies distribution indicates that three different types of inner-basin slopes (i. e. multi-level step-fault slope in the western area, slope flexure zone in <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> zone area and gentle slope in the eastern area) were developed along the southern slope of the Fushan Depression, together with a large-scale accommodation zone located at the intersection of the western and eastern fault systems. Further analysis shows that <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> zone played an important role in controlling not only stratal architectural variability in the southern slope but also depositional facies distribution in <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> zone area. During the high-stand stage, the deposition of depositional systems was mainly controlled by sediment supply and the NW-trending transfer faults. Major drainage systems entered the Fushan Depression through <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> zone along <b>the</b> direction of sediment supply, and sedimentary flow paths were parallel to <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> zone axis with sedimentary flows constrained to the adjacent areas of the NW-trending transfer faults. By contrast, during the low-stand stage, the transfer faults had little control over depositional facies distribution, and the sublacustrine fan sediments diverted away from <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> zone and flew down along the northeast, oblique to <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> zone axis. <b>The</b> flow division in the lowstand stage might be greatly influenced by flow type and topography. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>accommodation</b> zone area demonstrated unique hydrocarbon accumulation models different from the western and eastern areas, suggesting that the future exploration should be conducted at different levels in the Fushan Depression...|$|R

500|$|The {{potential}} {{dangers of}} the building were apparent to some, as no fire stops or party walls {{were present in the}} building to slow the progress of a fire. In the late eighteenth century a committee of MPs predicted {{that there would be a}} disaster if the palace caught fire. This was followed by a 1789 report from fourteen architects warning against the possibility of fire in the palace; signatories included Soane and Robert Adam. Soane again warned of the dangers in 1828, when he wrote that [...] "the want of security from fire, the narrow, gloomy and unhealthy passages, and the insufficiency of <b>the</b> <b>accommodations</b> in this building are important objections which call loudly for revision and speedy amendment."

500|$|By 31 March, 14th Field Troop had {{completed}} its mine-awareness training; only Lieutenant Stephen Alexander and five others remained at Oshakati, the main SADF {{base in the}} north of the country. During the early hours of 1 April an SADF aircraft began dropping flares, and mortar rounds landed near the base. This signalled the start of an intense period of conflict, and Alexander's team was quickly withdrawn to Grootfontein. What had occurred was the infiltration {{of a large number of}} PLAN combatants (about 1,600), re-entering Namibia from Angola. Accounts differed, but Hearn stated that all of those interviewed at the time made it clear that [...] "they did not enter Namibia for war, but to seek out the UN". Reuters reported that SWAPO demanded the right to establish bases in Namibia. The large size of the PLAN forces and the very small number of deployed UN forces (less than 1,000 at the time) meant that the UN had very little intelligence, and was unable to respond in force. Sitkowski wrote that the UN should have been informed about the high probability of SWAPO infiltration, but this did not occur.
