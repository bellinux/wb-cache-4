40|$|Robert Hill {{has made}} a {{valuable}} contribution to the conference {{in a number of}} respects. First, he has provided a succinct and thought-provoking discussion of the broad range of issues relevant to measuring inflation. Second, he has highlighted a number of developments that could potentially alter {{the way in which we}} measure inflation. For example, as Robert has explained, a reduction in the measurement bias would, by itself, reduce average CPI inflation, while a shift to more frequent updating of expenditure weights could increase the short-term volatility of CPI inflation. And third, he has issued a challenge for inflation-targeting central banks to consider the likely impact of these potential changes in inflation measurement on monetary policy. It is this third area on which I will focus my attention. The relevant discussion for policy-makers can be framed around two related questions: (i) how should inflation targeters deal with changes in the measurement of inflation; and, (ii) should inflation targeters care about the potential for mismeasurement of inflation? <b>The</b> <b>short</b> <b>answers</b> <b>are</b> first, that a flexible inflationtargeting regime can deal quite effectively with changes that affect the measuremen...|$|R

50|$|Fraud is {{more than}} just a {{possibility}} in these pension statements as there were 80,000 plus known pension applications. While Congress’ act of 1818 and 1820 discouraged military resignation and encouraged enlistment, it also allowed for poor colonists who did not serve to get fraud pensions from the United States Government. The pension office most commonly rejected pension applications because the soldier had not served nine months in the war. A small percentage of pension claims were rejected because the soldier’s name was not found on a roster. Widows often got rejected when they could not prove the date of their marriage with a veteran. Although these rejections were plentiful, there is no question the fraud pension statements were accepted by the pension office. So can the system be trusted especially decades after the war had ended? <b>The</b> <b>short</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> yes. The pension application procedure required the applicant to appear before a court and describe under oath his or her service. Also, there exist many historical records that contain names of officers, battles, and places that are compared with pension statements. Veterans who actually served usually kept the war alive by talking about it with family and friends. As mentioned above, a lot of enlisted men as well as widows were illiterate which most likely means they had no documentation of their service. In a random sample held by Graves and Harris, only one pension application of two hundred turned out to be fraud because the applicant tried to impersonate a soldier who had already died.|$|E

40|$|The 22 supersetnd Hohenheim Consensus Workshop {{took place}} in at the University of Stuttgart-Hohenheim. The subject of this conference was vitamin C {{and its role in}} the {{treatment}} of endothelial dysfunction. Scientists, who had published and reviewed scientific and regulatory papers on that topic were invited, among them basic researchers, toxicologists, clinicians and nutritionists. The participants were presented with eleven questions, which <b>were</b> discussed and <b>answered</b> at the workshop, with the aim of summarising the current state of knowledge. The explicatory text accompanying <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>answers</b> <b>was</b> produced and agreed on after the conference and was backed up by corresponding references. The therapeutic relevance of administration of the physiological antioxidant vitamin C in high parenteral doses in Endothelial Dependent Pathophysiological Conditions (EDPC) was discussed. Endothelial dysfunction is defined as including disturbed endothelial dependant relaxation of resistance vessels, breakdown of the microvascular endothelial barrier and/or loss of anti-adhesive function. It occurs in severe burn injury, intoxications, acute hyperglycemia, sepsis, trauma, and ischemic-reperfusion tissue injury and is induced by oxidative stress. Reduced plasma ascorbate levels are a hallmark of oxidative stress and occur in severe burns, sepsis, severe trauma, intoxication, chemotherapy/radiotherapy and organ transplantation. Vitamin C directly enhances the activity of nitric oxide synthase, the acyl CoA oxidase system and inhibits the actions of proinflammatory lipids. There is experimental evidence that parenteral high-dose vitamin C restores endothelial function in sepsis. In vitro, supraphysiological concentrations (&gt; 1 mM) of ascorbate restore nitric oxide bioavailability and endothelial function. Only parenterally, can enough vitamin C be administered to combat oxidative stress. There is no evidence that parenteral vitamin C exerts prooxidant effects in humans. Theoretical concerns in relation to competitive interactions between vitamin C and glucose cellular uptake are probably only relevant for oxidised vitamin C (dehydroascorbate) ...|$|R

It turns out that even pessimistic forecasts of economic growth are so promising that we could arguably either stop worrying about future generations 2 ̆ 7 economic well-being or even enact policies to shift economic well-being from the future to today. The flaw in that reasoning, however, lies in the unequal distribution of our economic prosperity, with a {{gap between rich and poor}} that is profoundly troubling. Even if future growth turns out to be as high as current forecasts predict, there is a very real chance that the least among us will not see their living standards rise at all, even as the more fortunate ascend to untold levels of affluence. I thus argue that a better approach to analyzing intergenerational issues is to view them as straightforward matters of distributive justice, focusing on how policies change the distribution of incomes across time as well as currently.
