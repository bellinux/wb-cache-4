40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the eigenfunctions of a linear system is a fundamental issue both from the theoretical {{as well as from}} the applications point of view. Nonetheless, no analytic solution is available for the eigenfunctions of a general linear system. There are two important classes of contributions suggesting analytic expressions for the eigenfunctions of slowly-varying operators: [5], and the references therein, where it was proved that the eigenfunctions of underspread operators can be ap-proximated by signals whose time-frequency distribution (TFD) is well localized in the time-frequency plane, and [7] where a strict relationship between the in-stantaneous frequency of the channel eigenfunctions and the contour lines of the Wigner Transform of the operator kernel (or Weyl symbol) was derived for Hermi-tian slowly-varying operators. In this article, following an approach similar to [7], we will show that the eigenfunctions can be found exactly for systems whose spread function is concentrated along a straight line and they can be found in approximate sense for those systems whose spread function is maximally concentrated in regions of the Doppler-delay plane whose area is smaller than one. 0. 1. 2 Eigenfunctions of time-varying systems The input/output relationship of a continuous-time (CT) linear system is [3]: y(t) = h(t, τ) x(t − τ) dτ (0. 1. 1) where h(t, τ) is the system impulse response. Although throughout this section we will use the terminology commonly adopted in the <b>transit</b> <b>of</b> <b>signals</b> through time-varying channels, it is worth pointing out that the mathematical formulation is much more general. For example, (0. 1. 1) can be used to describe the propagation of waves through non homogeneous media and in such a case the independent variables t and τ are spatial coordinates. Following the same notation introduced by Bello [3], any linear time-varying (LTV) channel can be fully characterized by its impulse response h(t, τ), or equivalently by the delay-Doppler spread function (or simply spread function) S(ν, τ) := − ∞ h(t, τ) e −j 2 piνtdt, or by the time-varying transfer function H(t, f) := − ∞ h(t, τ) ...|$|E

40|$|Plants {{and animals}} have had about 1. 6 billion years—the time that {{has passed since}} they diverged from their last {{unicellular}} ancestor—to evolve different mechanisms for solving unique problems of development and inter-cellular signaling. As an example, plant cells are sepa-rated from each other by a substantial extracellular ma-trix, the cell wall. Although the cell wall is not imper-vious, {{it is likely to}} hinder cell-to-cell communication. Moreover, because plant cells cannot migrate during de-velopment, location, instead of lineage, is the primary determinant of cell fate in plants, making communica-tion over both long and short distances essential for the coordination of plant growth. It appears that plants have significantly overcome the downside of having a cell wall by forming channels between cells to allow the <b>transit</b> <b>of</b> <b>signaling</b> and other important molecules. Plants may even be considered as supracellular organ-isms, in that whole tissues are symplastically connected. The channels that connect plant cells are called plasmo-desmata (PD), and their investigation offers tantalizing clues as to how plant cells may use them to communi-cate with each other and to coordinate development. Al-though once seen as constricted channels through which only molecules < 1 kD in size could pass (Terry and Ro-bards 1987; Burnell 1988), PD have recently been shown to be far more dynamic and allow passage of both pro-teins and nucleic acids.
