[...] "Anything goes among the physics community – cosmic wormholes, time travel," [...] he argues, [...] "just {{so long as it}} keeps its distance from anything mystical or New Age-ish." [...] Referring to this position as [...] "pathological disbelief," [...] he holds it responsible for the rejection by academic journals of papers on the paranormal. He has compared parapsychology to the theory of continental drift, proposed in 1912 by Alfred Wegener (1880–1930) to explain observations that were otherwise inexplicable, which was resisted and ridiculed until evidence led to its acceptance after Wegener's death.|$|E
500|$|The story, for Mellor, was strong; [...] "the shocks {{have the}} {{intended}} impact {{and the whole}} half-hour works a treat". She commended the [...] "good writing [...] excellent structure". Hogan considered the episode [...] "ingeniously plotted", and Owen called it [...] "delightfully written". [...] The timing was also praised. Critics were less convinced by the revelation {{at the end of}} the episode; though Butler called it [...] "satisfying and surprising", it was criticised as lacking in meaning, and as [...] "prosaically disappointing". For Billen, the reveal made the episode's premise [...] "less interesting", and, for Owen, the characters were <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> admit defeat. The final scene, in particular, was criticised, with some commentators suggesting that, if thought about too much, it was not fully convincing; it was described as [...] "arguably unnecessary" [...] and as offering the episode's only [...] "punch [...] to connect".|$|E
500|$|On 12 August, the Football Association {{announced}} that Pogba would be suspended for Manchester United's opening Premier League fixture of the 2016–17 season against Bournemouth, due to two yellow cards he had accumulated {{in the previous}} season's edition of the Coppa Italia with Juventus. On 19 August, {{he made his first}} appearance since returning to the club in a 2–0 home victory over Southampton in the Premier League. After the 2–1 defeat at home in the first Manchester Derby of the season on 10 September, Pogba was criticized for his lack of discipline in positioning by pundit Jamie Carragher. Pogba, however, soon recovered to form and scored his first Premier League goal for United with a header against defending champions Leicester City in a 4–1 home win on 24 September. He then scored twice, once from the penalty spot and then with a strike from distance, in a Europa League tie against Fenerbahçe on 20 October. Manager José Mourinho defended Pogba after the game, criticizing football's [...] "Einsteins" [...] for being <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> judge the player.|$|E

500|$|During {{the second}} half of the war, {{political}} opposition within the Royalist senior leadership against Rupert continued to grow. Rupert's personality during the war had made him both friends and enemies. He enjoyed a [...] "frank and generous disposition", showed a [...] "quickness of... intellect", was prepared to face grave dangers, and could be thorough and patient when necessary. However, he lacked the social gifts of a courtier, and his humour could turn into a [...] "sardonic wit and a contemptuous manner": with a hasty temper, he was <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> say who he respected, and who he disliked. The result was that, while Rupert could inspire great loyalty in some, especially his men, he also made many enemies at the Royal court. When he took Bristol, he also slighted the Marquess of Hertford, the lethargic but politically significant Royalist leader of the South-West. Most critically, Rupert fell out with George Digby, a favourite of both the King and the Queen. Digby was a classic courtier and Rupert fell to arguing with him repeatedly in meetings. The result was that towards the end of the war Rupert's position at court was increasingly undermined by his enemies.|$|E
500|$|Issue #1 {{received}} an average score of 7.3/10 based on 26 reviews from critics on Comic Book Roundup. Greg McElhatton of CBR gave it four stars writing, [...] "Overall, Civil War II #1 {{is a good}} launching point for this miniseries, even as it integrates the information from Civil War II #0 and the Free Comic Book Day special. I'm curious to see if Bendis and Marquez can maintain this level of tension and what they'll add into the mix to keep the conflict burning strong. For now, though, it's {{more than enough to}} get readers coming back for more." [...] Schedeen gave it a 7.1 saying, [...] "This first issue cleanly establishes the conflict and delivers a nonstop stream of gorgeous artwork. However, it offers few surprises for those not already familiar with the basics of this crossover, and it often fails to elicit a strong emotional response in the way the first issue of Civil War did ten years ago." [...] Richard Gray of Newsarama gave it a 7 and said, [...] "At this early stage, Civil War II suffers {{some of the problems that}} have beleaguered similar narratives in recent years, principally in seeing heroes all <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> take sides against comrades on a possible future. Yet this is also just the beginning of something much larger, and while it may seem at times like this is an extended version of the 'zero' issue that preceded it, all the pieces are now in place for the 'war' proper to commence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Simon {{has been}} {{critical}} of traditional economics’ elementary understanding of decision-making, and argues it [...] "is <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> build an idealistic, unrealistic picture of the decision-making process and then prescribe {{on the basis of}} such unrealistic picture."

5000|$|Trenchant early {{criticism}} of Freud's monism {{was made by}} Karen Horney, who suggested that the psychoanalytic view had itself become fixated {{at the level of}} the small boy aggrandising himself at his sister's expense.

2500|$|One unique {{facet of}} Kean’s {{leadership}} was his advocacy for the arts. Leaders {{in the arts}} community praised the Governor for his work. This work culminated {{in the creation of}} the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, a highly successful cultural and entertainment center in Newark. Although its creation required roughly $200 million in funding, Kean believed that the cultural center had the power to revitalize the city, making the risk worth it. The Governor also believed that improving the city would strengthen the state as a whole. [...] Kean has remained involved in advocacy for the arts years after his time as governor, criticizing recent state-level funding cuts for being <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> do away with arts spending.|$|E

5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is <b>too</b> <b>quick,</b> contributing <b>to</b> an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start to lean {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|R
2500|$|The {{publication}} of the article immediately led to a public backlash. Editorial pages of newspapers received numerous letters from angry readers, and clergymen vehemently protested {{the content of the}} article. Even though the article itself explored the theological and philosophical issues in depth, [...] "any people...were <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> judge the magazine by its cover and denounced Time as a haven of godlessness". For Time the issue caused around 3,500 letters to the editorthe largest number of responses to any one story {{in the history of the}} magazine. Reader criticism was targeted at Thomas J. J. Altizer in particular. Altizer left Emory in 1968, and by the end of the decade the [...] "death of God" [...] movement had lost much of its momentum. In its issue of December 26, 1969, Time ran a follow-up cover story asking, [...] "Is God Coming Back to Life"? ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 1, 2013, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett {{announced}} he would sue the NCAA in federal court over the sanctions imposed on Penn State. [...] Although Corbett is an ex officio {{member of the board}} of trustees, Penn State was not involved in the suit. [...] According to the Associated Press, Corbett was filing an antitrust suit against the NCAA. Though Corbett had originally [...] "endorsed [...] as 'part of the corrective process'", [...] he and other Pennsylvania elected officials had more recently begun to object to the prospect of the $60 million fine being spent mostly outside of Pennsylvania. One reason given for the objection is that there is no legal way Penn State can ensure that taxpayer money won't be used to pay the fine. In sharply criticizing the governor's move in an editorial, The New York Times noted that the governor [...] "barely mentioned the young victims" [...] in his 2013 statement. It continued: [...] "In his complaints, the governor only confirmed the inquiry finding that the university’s obsession with football predominance helped drive the cover-up of Mr. Sandusky’s crimes." [...] It also noted that, in the suit, Corbett [...] "bypassed incoming state attorney general Kathleen Kane [...] in her election campaign last year ... promised to look into why it took so long for the pedophilia scandal to be investigated when Mr. Corbett previously served as attorney general". The Patriot-News said of the suit: [...] " [...] comes after a year of withering criticism of Corbett by some quarters of the Penn State community, which has seen the governor and his fellow PSU trustees as <b>too</b> <b>quick</b> <b>to</b> brand former head coach Joe Paterno and others as fall guys for the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal." [...] On June 6, 2013, federal Middle District Judge Yvette Kane said she could not [...] "find any factual allegations" [...] and threw out the lawsuit calling it [...] "a Hail Mary pass" [...] that easily warranted dismissal.|$|E
