He is subsequently invited back to Goldfinger's mansion near Reculver where he narrowly escapes being caught on camera looking over the house. Goldfinger introduces Bond to his factotum, a Korean named Oddjob.|$|E
5|$|In 682, Jasaw Chan K'awiil I erected {{the first}} dated {{monument}} at Tikal in 120 years and claimed {{the title of}} kaloomte, so ending the hiatus. He initiated a programme of new construction and turned the <b>tables</b> <b>on</b> Calakmul when, in 695, he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered. After this, Calakmul never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory.|$|E
5|$|Billy and Stu {{discuss their}} plan to kill Sidney and frame the murder spree on her father, {{whom they have}} taken hostage. The pair also reveal that they, not Cotton, murdered her mother, Maureen, as she {{was having an affair}} with Billy's father, which drove his mother away. Gale, who survived the crash, intervenes, and Sidney takes {{advantage}} of this to turn the <b>tables</b> <b>on</b> her attackers, killing Stu. Randy is revealed to be wounded but alive. Billy attacks Sidney but she shoots him through the head, killing him. As the sun rises and police arrive, a badly injured Dewey is taken away by ambulance and Gale makes an impromptu news report about the night's events.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} season at Massillon, Brown's team posted a 5–4–1 record, better than the {{previous}} year but far from Brown's exacting standards. The Tigers improved again in 1933, ending with an 8–2 record but losing to their chief rivals, the Canton McKinley High School Bulldogs. In 1934, Massillon won all of its games until a 21–6 defeat to Canton in {{the final game of}} the season. As the pressure on Brown grew to turn the <b>tables</b> <b>on</b> Canton, Massillon finally accomplished the feat the following year in an undefeated season, the first of several with Brown at the helm.|$|E
5|$|In late 2007 the {{restaurant}} {{moved to a}} modern building custom-built for {{the restaurant}} about 100 meters from the prior location, with the original location still being used for staff meals. The new layout features wooden floors, with simply dressed <b>tables.</b> <b>On</b> each table sits three stones to signify the three Roca brothers, while the tableware is Rosenthal china. The enlarged kitchen in the new location includes space for thirty chefs to work and also features Joan Roca's open plan office, {{so that he can}} {{keep an eye on the}} chefs even while he is doing more administrative tasks. At least one of the three brothers is present for every service. There is a capacity for 45 diners.|$|E
5|$|In {{the morning}} draw, women's team play saw Team North America turning the <b>tables</b> <b>on</b> Team World by winning two games and {{splitting}} the points for the third. Heather Nedohin held a slight lead over Margaretha Sigfridsson, who tried {{to win the game}} in the final end but fell short and tied the game. Jennifer Jones and Mirjam Ott played a back-and-forth game which saw Ott miss a double-takeout attempt for the win, allowing Jones to steal the point. Allison Pottinger stole three in the fifth end against Eve Muirhead and held the lead {{through the rest of the}} game, capping off the game with a four-point end.|$|E

5|$|When {{you throw}} a {{cat in the}} oven, it's easy to have someone in the {{orchestra}} slam a hammer down on an anvil, scaring {{the hell out of}} everyone. The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. You hear the same music when Dussander is turning the <b>tables</b> <b>on</b> Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E
5|$|While {{filming the}} scene where Keller and her team perform a Decompressive {{craniectomy}} on Weir, an actual brain surgeon performed the same procedure on a head model live from ten feet away, and directed the cast on what to do. While following the surgeon, Staite was nervous about doing the scene. After filming was completed, the surgeon's voice {{was removed from the}} final cut. During the sequence where the city travels through a clearing in the asteroid field, the producers wanted {{the scene where}} Atlantis gets hit by the odd asteroid as authentic as possible, so in the control room, not only the cameras, but the screens and <b>tables</b> <b>on</b> the set were shaken slightly as well.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{discovers that}} he has an ally who is also working {{undercover}} at the half-built resort, Felix Leiter, who has been recalled to duty by the CIA and is working ostensibly as an electrical engineer while setting up bugs in Scaramanga's meeting room. However, they learn that Scaramanga plans to eliminate Bond when the weekend is over. Bond's true identity is confirmed by a KGB agent and Scaramanga makes new plans to entertain the gangsters and the KGB agent by killing Bond while they are riding a sight-seeing train to a marina. However, Bond manages to turn the <b>tables</b> <b>on</b> Scaramanga and, {{with the help of}} Leiter, kill most of the conspirators. Wounded, Scaramanga escapes into the swamps, where Bond pursues him. Scaramanga lulls Bond off-guard and shoots him with a golden derringer hidden in his palm. Bond is hit but returns fire and shoots Scaramanga several times, killing him at last.|$|E

5|$|On Memorial Day, May 28, 2012, Shackleford raced in what analysts {{called the}} deepest {{field of the}} year {{featuring}} favorites To Honor and Serve, Caleb's Posse, Jackson Bend and Caixa Eletronica in the $750,000 Grade 1 Metropolitan Handicap (known by most as the Met Mile run at one mile on the dirt at Belmont Park). Shackleford had just enough left to withstand the furious late rush of Caleb's Posse, stopping the clock in 1:33 1/5 over the fast track to win by a nose. Favorite To Honor and Serve was another three and half lengths back in third. With this win, Shackleford turned the <b>tables</b> <b>on</b> old rival Caleb's Posse, who beat him in the 2011 Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile. The horses met each other four times, with each winning two races. However, Caleb's Posse retired soon after the Met Mile.|$|E
5|$|With the Senate's assent, Agrippina and Nero {{begin to}} ascend the throne, but the {{ceremony}} {{is interrupted by}} the entrance of Claudius's servant Lesbus. He announces that his master is alive ("Allegrezza! Claudio giunge!"), saved from death by Otho, {{the commander of the}} army. Otho himself confirms this and reveals that Claudius has promised him the throne as a mark of gratitude. Agrippina is frustrated, until Otho secretly confides to her that he loves the beautiful Poppaea more than he desires the throne. Agrippina, aware that Claudius also loves Poppaea, sees a new opportunity of furthering her ambitions for Nero. She goes to Poppaea and tells her, falsely, that Otho has struck a bargain with Claudius whereby he, Otho, gains the throne but gives Poppaea to Claudius. Agrippina advises Poppaea to turn the <b>tables</b> <b>on</b> Otho by telling the Emperor that Otho has ordered her to refuse Claudius's attentions. This, Agrippina believes, will make Claudius revoke his promise to Otho of the throne.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{this period}} the pro-independence forces made two {{important}} advances. In the Southern Cone, a veteran of the Spanish army with experience in the Peninsular War, José de San Martín, became the governor of the Province of Cuyo. He used this position to begin organizing an army as early as 1814 in preparation for an invasion of Chile. This was an important change in strategy after three United Provinces campaigns had been defeated in Upper Peru. San Martín's army became the nucleus of the Army of the Andes, which received crucial political and material support in 1816 when Juan Martín de Pueyrredón became Supreme Director of the United Provinces. In January 1817, San Martín was finally ready to advance against the royalists in Chile. Ignoring an injunction from the congress of the Río de la Plata not to move against Chile, San Martín together with General Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme, later Supreme Director of Chile, led the Army over the Andes in a move that turned the <b>tables</b> <b>on</b> the royalists. By February 10, San Martín had control of northern and central Chile, and a year later, after a war with no quarter, the south. With the aid of a fleet under the command of former British naval officer Thomas Cochrane, Chile was secured from royalist control and independence was declared that year. San Martín and his allies spent the next two years planning an invasion of Peru, which began in 1820.|$|E
