40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} {{methods were}} used to investigate the flyability of magnetic recording sliders on discrete <b>track</b> <b>recording</b> media. Experiment techniques were developed to study the hysteresis of "touch-down" and "take-off" of magnetic recording sliders on discrete <b>track</b> <b>recording</b> media. The slider dynamics on discrete <b>track</b> <b>recording</b> media was compared with that on conventional smooth (flat) media. Various experimental methods {{were used to}} study the contact behavior, wear characteristics and tribological characteristics of discrete recording media. Advantages and disadvantages of discrete <b>track</b> <b>recording</b> media were investigated and compared with conventional smooth media. To improve flyability and mechanical properties of discrete <b>track</b> <b>recording</b> media, planarization of discrete track media was employe...|$|R

Also included are four <b>tracks</b> <b>recorded</b> at the sessions for The Electrifying Eddie Harris (Atlantic, 1967).|$|R
5|$|Before its release, many journalists {{expected}} Pirates of the Caribbean to be a flop. The pirate genre had {{not been}} successful for years, with Cutthroat Island (1995) being a notable flop. The film was also based on a theme park ride, and Depp, known mostly for starring in cult films at the time, had little <b>track</b> <b>record</b> as a box office leading man.|$|E
5|$|Jackson quickly built a <b>track</b> <b>record</b> {{of never}} missing a floor vote. Once he nearly missed his great-grandmother's funeral for a roll call, but the {{presiding}} officer {{was able to}} slightly delay the closing the roll, thereby keeping his attendance record. Fellow Democrats said he debates and votes with a contentiousness {{that makes it difficult}} to view him as a team player. Jackson developed foes not only in the House, but also in Chicago against William Daley, who had a hand in several attempts to block Jackson's seating on the transportation committee he desired because of his support for a third Chicago airport. Jackson has also been a target of conservative media figures. Jackson established a heavily liberal voting record on both social and fiscal issues. During the 1990s, because of his name recognition and liberal <b>track</b> <b>record,</b> Jackson received many public speaking and media requests.|$|E
5|$|The two Mercedes {{exchanged}} new <b>track</b> <b>record</b> {{times as}} Rosberg, then Hamilton, {{and once again}} Rosberg set fast times during Q2. Bottas was again the fastest non-Mercedes runner, but teammate Felipe Massa was hindered by traffic and did not proceed into Q3. Also eliminated were Pastor Maldonado, Jenson Button, Felipe Nasr, and Daniil Kvyat, the latter two being bettered by a late fast lap from Max Verstappen.|$|E

5|$|After {{ten weeks}} being {{constantly}} watched to prevent suicide attempts in police custody, he {{was transferred to}} Akershus Fortress and awaited trial {{as part of the}} legal purge. Despite initially losing weight and suffering from polyneuritis, his strong constitution meant that he soon started working hard on his case with Henrik Bergh, a lawyer with a good <b>track</b> <b>record</b> but largely unsympathetic, at least initially, to Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried to act {{in the best interests of}} Norway and decided to use this as a starting point for the defence.|$|E
5|$|After the 2014 race {{had been}} held at a resurfaced circuit, causing the teams to fight with the soft tyre choice by Pirelli, speculations arose if drivers {{would be able to}} {{challenge}} the eleven-year old <b>track</b> <b>record</b> set by Rubens Barrichello in 2004. However, practice showed that lap times actually slowed due to changes to the kerbs, forcing the drivers {{to stay away from the}} insides of the corners. Pirelli chose the soft and medium compounds for the event.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st century, the {{landscape}} of large leveraged buyout firms was changing. Several large and storied firms, including Hicks Muse Tate & Furst and Forstmann Little & Company were dragged down by heavy losses in the bursting of the telecom bubble. Although, KKR's <b>track</b> <b>record</b> since RJR Nabisco was mixed, losses on such investments as Regal Entertainment Group, Spalding, Flagstar and Primedia (previously K-III Communications) were offset by successes in Willis Group, Wise Foods, Inc., Wincor Nixdorf and MTU Aero Engines, among others.|$|E

5|$|Forty-four {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only forty-three raced because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Edwards clinched his eighth pole position during his career, {{with a time}} of 26.224 seconds, which was a new <b>track</b> <b>record.</b> He was joined on the front row of the grid by Kurt Busch. Kahne qualified third, Kyle Busch took fourth, and Smith started fifth. Joey Logano, Martin Truex, Jr., McMurray, Keselowski, and Biffle rounded out the first ten positions. The driver who failed to qualify for the race was Brian Keselowski, who had a time of 27.431 seconds.|$|E
5|$|In the Gotham Stakes on April 7, Laurin {{decided to}} {{experiment}} with Secretariat's running style. With no speed horses entered in the race, Secretariat {{would be allowed to}} set his own pace. Accordingly, Turcotte hustled Secretariat from the starting gate and they led easily. Down the stretch though, Champagne Charlie came running and at the eighth pole was almost even. Turcotte tapped Secretariat once on each side with the whip and Secretariat drew away to win by three lengths. He ran the first 3/4 mile in 1:08 and finished the one-mile race in 1:33, matching the <b>track</b> <b>record.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 2 July 2014, Sporting Clube de Portugal {{announced}} {{the signing of}} Gauld from Dundee United, for an undisclosed fee rumoured {{to be in the}} region of £3 million. He signed a six-year contract with a €60 million buy-out clause. He credited Sporting's <b>track</b> <b>record</b> of developing players such as Luís Figo, Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani for his decision to join them. Despite being put into the club's B-team, Gauld was named in the 25-man squad to play in the UEFA Champions League after impressing manager Marco Silva during training sessions.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} a still-standing <b>track</b> <b>record</b> of 1:59, Secretariat ran each quarter-mile segment {{faster than}} the one before it. The {{successive}} quarter-mile times were :25, :24, :23, :23, and :23. This means he was still accelerating as of the final quarter-mile of the race. No other horse had won the Derby in less than 2 minutes before, and it would not be accomplished again until Monarchos ran the race in 1:59.97 in 2001.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Nerva lacked {{widespread}} {{support in the}} Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist, his <b>track</b> <b>record</b> would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history, but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after {{the news of the}} assassination broke. The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy.|$|E
