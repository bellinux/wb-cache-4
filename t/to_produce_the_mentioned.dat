40|$|Abstract. The {{sustainable}} world’s {{economic growth}} and people’s life improvement greatly depend {{on the use of}} alternative products in the architecture and construction, such as industrial wastes conventionally called “green materials”. This paper concerns the main results of an experimental work carried out with the objective of developing new composite materials based on gypsum and incorporating waste material as granulated cork, a by-product of cork industry, and cellulose fibres, a waste of paper industry. Such materials are intended to be used as composite boards for non structural elements of construction, such as dry walls and ceiling. Cork (bark of the plant Quercus Suber L), a substance largely produced in Portugal, is a material whose characteristics are of considerable interest for the construction industry. It is regarded as a strategic material with enormous potential by its reduced density, elasticity, compressibility, waterproof, vibration absorption, thermal and acoustic insulation efficiency [1]. During the first stage of this research work the gypsum binder and its properties were studied. Then, composites with mineral additions (added to increase the waterproofing and resistance) were also developed and submitted to tests to determine their physical and mechanical properties. In last stage, reinforced composites using different industrial by-products have been developed. This paper will present the properties and the manufacture methods used <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>the</b> above <b>mentioned</b> eco-friendly composites that can ease ways for using industrial wastes as new construction materials, with excellent inherent thermal and acoustic properties...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a great {{increase}} in the amount of the document production since the 1900 ?s {{with the help of the}} institutionalization and the heavy usage of the computers at the institutions as a result of the industrialization. The increasing document production necessitated the institutions <b>to</b> control their <b>produced</b> documents, <b>to</b> prevent <b>the</b> production of unnecessary documents and <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> well-qualified documents. <b>The</b> <b>mentioned</b> necessities are <b>the</b> most important factors that create the document management. Document management is a management operation that contains the management of the entire period which starts with the production of the documents and ends with the transfer of the documents to the archives. The institutions and <b>the</b> organizations have <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>the</b> documents, <b>to</b> receive the documents, to store the documents that prove the institutions and the organizations had completed those transactions and to reuse the documents in order to continue their activities, to run the management and to execute legal obligations. In the current era when the production and the usage of the documents reach to an amazing size, it can easily be seen that the importance and the usage of the archives are tremendously increased as parallel to the increase in the number of the data and the documents. The purpose of this paper is to study the correspondence, filing, document and archive operations according to the principles and policies of the document and archive managements. The content of this paper consists of the concepts of ?document management?, ?archive management? and the document and archive services at the ?Istanbul Stock Exchange?. The document and the archive managements are tried to be explained in detail and the document and the archive managements at the Istanbul Stock Exchange are studied...|$|R

50|$|A total {{synthesis}} of progesterone {{was reported in}} 1971 by W.S. Johnson. The synthesis begins with reacting the phosphonium salt 7 with phenyl lithium <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>the</b> phosphonium ylide 8. The ylide 8 is reacted with an aldehyde <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>the</b> alkene 9. The ketal protecting groups of 9 are hydrolyzed <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>the</b> diketone 10, {{which in turn is}} cyclized to form the cyclopentenone 11. The ketone of 11 is reacted with methyl lithium to yield the tertiary alcohol 12, which in turn is treated with acid <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>the</b> tertiary cation 13.
