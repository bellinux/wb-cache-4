5|$|Some of {{the ministers}} heading congregations {{in the area}} {{attended}} the Seneca Falls Convention, but none spoke out during the sessions, not even when comments from the floor were invited. On Sunday, July 23, many who had attended, and more who had not, attacked the Convention, the Declaration of Sentiments, and the resolutions. Women in the congregations reported to Stanton, who saw {{the actions of the}} ministers as cowardly; in their congregations, no one would be allowed <b>to</b> <b>reply.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wittmann drove towards Villers-Bocage {{and along}} the road, the Rifle Brigade troops {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> with PIAT anti-tank weapons and a 6-pounder anti-tank gun but, as the Tiger drew closer, panic set in and the riflemen looked for cover. The brigade vehicles were set on fire by machine guns and high-explosive shells, but few casualties were inflicted. At {{the east end of}} Villers-Bocage, Wittmann engaged and knocked out three M5 Stuart light tanks of the 4th CLY Reconnaissance Troop.|$|E

5|$|Clemson's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 14-yard line, where the Yellow Jackets began their game-winning drive. The offense began slowly; Georgia Tech gained only nine yards in three plays, setting up a crucial fourth-down conversion. A failed try would give Clemson the ball deep in Georgia Tech territory, with little time remaining in the game for Georgia Tech <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> to any score. Instead, the Yellow Jackets converted the fourth down, keeping their drive alive. On the first play after the fourth-down conversion, Nesbitt completed a 21-yard pass to Dwyer, pushing Tech to near midfield. Eight plays later, Dwyer breached the Clemson defense for a 15-yard gain and the go-ahead score. A false start penalty on Georgia Tech's two-point conversion try prevented any extra points, but the touchdown's six points were enough to give Georgia Tech a 39–34 lead.|$|E
5|$|Don instructs the Jaguar team {{to ditch}} the {{mistress}} concept {{because it is}} vulgar. Later, Harry praises Peggy's work on Chevalier Blanc. She tells Don the client ultimately went with the same ad as before, only in a Paris setting. Don says Ginsberg will take over once the Jaguar pitch is finished, prompting Peggy <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> {{that she is not}} in charge of everything. Don pulls some money from his wallet and condescendingly tosses it in Peggy's face, telling her that if she wants to go to Paris, she should just go. Ken tries to comfort her, saying that Don is just upset about Jaguar, to which she replies that she does not care.|$|E

Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave. Both parents were given arguido status on 7 September, and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A.

5|$|Tătărescu became Foreign Minister {{and vice}} {{president}} of the government in the cabinet of Petru Groza when the latter came into office after Soviet pressures in 1945; his faction had been awarded leadership of four other ministries — Finance, with three successive office-holders (of whom the last was Alexandru Alexandrini), Public Works, with Gheorghe Vântu, Industry (with Petre N. Bejan), and Religious Affairs, with Radu Roșculeț. He indirectly helped the PCR carry out an electoral fraud during the general election in 1946 by failing <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> to American proposals for organizing fair elections. At the Paris Conference, where he was accompanied by the PCR leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and Pătrășcanu, he acknowledged the dissolution of Greater Romania under the provisions of the new Treaty (1947).|$|E
5|$|Venezuela's senior counsel was former US President Benjamin Harrison, {{assisted}} by Severo Mallet-Prevost, Benjamin F. Tracy, James R. Soley, and José María Rojas. Britain {{was represented by}} its Attorney General, Richard Webster, {{assisted by}} Robert Reid, George Askwith and Sidney Rowlatt, with Sir Frederick Pollock preparing the original outline of Britain's argument. The parties had eight months to prepare their case, another four months <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> to the other party's case, and other three months for the final printed case. The final arguments were submitted in December 1898, with the total evidence and testimony amounting to 23 volumes.|$|E
5|$|After two failed {{attempts}} {{to capture the}} fort by straight forward attacks, the British resorted to attrition tactics. On 28 November, instead of launching another infantry assault, the fort was encircled from all sides and placed under siege. This prevented Nepalese reinforcements from entering the fort. Mawbey then instructed his gunners, by now strongly reinforced, to fire into the fort. He also sent scouts to locate and cut off the fort's external water source. The water situation was made worse for the defenders when about a hundred earthen vessels stocked with water, stored in a portico, were destroyed in the bombardment. The eastern and northern walls of the fort were razed to the ground. The continuous bombardment also caused {{three of the four}} cannons installed on the fort's battlements to fall outside the fort, while the other fell inside. The other cannons that the Nepalese possessed were unusable, having either been disabled by misfiring during previous attacks, or because they had been buried under rubble in the British bombardment. Left without any cannons <b>to</b> <b>reply,</b> the garrison suffered heavy casualties. They continued to resist using gunfire and stones, but eventually the few people that remained in the fort became desperate and could not hold on any longer. That night, despite threats to their person and property, desertion became rampant.|$|E

5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Winnie Johnson sent Hindley another letter, again {{pleading}} with her to assist the police in finding the body of her son Keith. In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity. Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987. This time, the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher. She stayed overnight in Manchester, at the flat of the police chief in charge of GMP training at Sedgley Park, Prestwich, and visited the moor twice. She confirmed to police that the two areas {{in which they were}} concentrating their search—Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain—were correct, although she was unable to locate either of the graves. She later remembered that as Pauline Reade was being buried she had been sitting next to her on a patch of grass and could see the rocks of Hollin Brown Knoll silhouetted against the night sky.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Marshall {{departed}} for Philadelphia, the temporary national capital, George Muter and Benjamin Sebastian, both justices of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, published a pamphlet stating that Marshall had perjured {{himself in a}} Court of Appeals case between himself and James Wilkinson. No known copies of the pamphlet are extant, and related surviving documents do not relate {{the exact nature of}} the charges. Marshall, being out of the state, was unable <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> immediately to the charges, and his enemies in the General Assembly drafted a memorial to the U.S. Senate requesting an investigation of the charges. On December 16, 1795, the memorial was approved by the General Assembly and transmitted to the Senate. The Senate appointed a committee to recommend action on the memorial, and the committee found that the charges against Marshall were not specific, that the authors had provided no evidence upon which to evaluate the charges, that no one was empowered to prosecute the charges in the Senate, and that further action by the Senate was inappropriate. On March 22, 1796, the Senate approved the committee's report by a vote of 168. Muter and Sebastian never filed formal charges against Marshall for perjury.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{entered the}} 2010 season after a 2009 {{campaign}} {{that saw the}} team finish 10–3, including a season-ending win in the 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl against the Tennessee Volunteers. Because of that season-ending victory and the Hokies' general good performance during the 2009 season, Virginia Tech was ranked No. 10 in preseason national polling. The Hokies' {{first game of the}} season was a nationally televised contest against then-No. 3 Boise State at FedExField near Washington, D.C.. Because the game {{was the first of the}} season to feature two top-10 teams, it received large amounts of media coverage. During the game, Virginia Tech fell behind 17–0 in the first quarter, but rallied to take a 21–20 lead early in the third quarter. The two teams traded the lead, alternating scoring drives until Boise State scored a touchdown with 1:06 remaining. Virginia Tech was unable <b>to</b> <b>reply</b> one final time, and Boise State earned a 33–30 victory.|$|E

5|$|The {{game that}} became Fez {{began in a}} {{collaboration}} between Montreal-based Phil Fish and Toronto-based Shawn McGrath on McGrath's idea for a puzzle game: a four-sided 3D space with each side in 2D, similar to Fish's 3D pixels (voxels) as incorporated into Fez. The entirety of Fez design, lore, and art descends from this game mechanic. Fish provided the project's art and credited his influence to Shigeru Miyamoto and Hayao Miyazaki. Fish and McGrath's partnership crumbled due to creative differences, as Fish {{wanted to create a}} platform game. Fish continued to work on the game in his spare time and announced his search for a programmer on DeviantArt, and the first person <b>to</b> <b>reply,</b> Renaud Bédard, became lead programmer. They were both the same age and living in Montreal. Though Bédard had some hobbyist experience in 3D graphics and was studying computer science, Fez was his first professional game development project.

5|$|Upon Lee's {{return from}} the army, Whitney gives the {{relationship}} another chance.

Ryan's young daughter Lily Branning (Aine Garvey) comes to live in Walford when her mother Stacey Branning (Lacey Turner) is sent to prison, and Whitney babysits her. She puts a photo of herself and Lily online and is shocked when Ryan contacts her under the alias of 'Simon Parker'. After speaking with Johnny and Lee, she decides <b>to</b> <b>reply.</b> Stacey is granted her appeal and freed but Whitney worries it will ruin her relationship with Lily. Whitney tells Lily about Ryan saying she could possibly meet him. When Stacey finds out, she argues with Whitney and says she will not be seeing Lily again. Whitney then messages Ryan saying she needs to see him urgently. Whitney then arranges to meet Ryan at the park. Stacey and Lily visit the park whilst Whitney is waiting for Ryan. Stacey apologises to Whitney and she accepts. Whitney thinks Ryan has stood her up, so leaves with Stacey and Lily. Ryan turns up late and hides on seeing Stacey, and remains unseen as a result.|$|E
