25|$|On 1 November 2013, a 3 coach KTM Class 83 derailed near Rawang station while {{moving through}} a <b>track</b> <b>switch.</b> No {{one was hurt}} in the incident. The two rear coaches were {{separated}} and towed away using a locomotive while the remaining front coach removed by use of cranes.|$|E
25|$|The {{southbound}} Metrolink train (#100) {{struck the}} parked Jeep {{that had been}} driven by Álvarez onto the tracks at the Chevy Chase Drive grade crossing just west of San Fernando Road, pushing the Jeep southward along the track towards the Los Feliz Boulevard undercrossing until automotive parts struck a <b>track</b> <b>switch</b> and became lodged under the leading car of the Metrolink train, raising it up and causing the train to derail. Cars from the derailed train jackknifed, hitting both the locomotive of the stationary freight train and sideswiping {{the rear of the}} passing northbound #901 Metrolink passenger train. This caused the rear cars of the northbound train to derail, and at least one car rolled over onto its side. A fire, involving one or more passenger cars, was caused by spilled diesel fuel.|$|E
500|$|The train departs {{the station}} {{to the right and}} climbs a small lift leading to a short drop, then circles around to the [...] lift hill, {{carrying}} the riders into the [...] mountain. It is the tallest attraction at Walt Disney World, beating The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror by 6 inches. Disney keeps it just under 200 feet because law requires structures 200 feet or taller to have a blinking red light as a beacon for low-flying planes, which Disney feels would take parkgoers out of the experience. On the way up it passes through a ransacked temple with murals of the yeti, warning the riders that the mountain is his territory. At {{the top of the mountain}} the train curves around the main peak and goes through a cave. When it emerges, it draws to a halt in front of track that has been torn apart, presumably by the yeti. The train itself is held in place by a series of rubber tires while an automatic switch rotates the piece of track directly behind the train. The train then rolls backwards along a new route that spirals down through the mountain, coming to a halt in a large cave, where riders see the yeti's shadow on the wall as he tears up more track. This effect distracts riders from noticing another automatic <b>track</b> <b>switch</b> rotates in front of them. As the shadow moves away, the train rolls forward out of the mountain and down the main [...] drop. It enters a 250° turn and speeds back up through another cave in the mountain, where the roars of the yeti are heard once more. The train exits from the rear of the mountain and enters a large helix before being lifted back into the mountain a final time. The train drops through a cave, where the yeti is reaching down toward it. On reaching the bottom of this drop, riders return to the unloading dock and depart into a gift shop. One ride takes about 2 minutes and 50 seconds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Track</b> <b>switching</b> greatly {{increases}} headway distance. A vehicle {{must wait}} for the previous vehicle to clear the track, for the <b>track</b> to <b>switch</b> and for the switch to be verified. If the <b>track</b> <b>switching</b> is faulty, vehicles {{must be able to}} stop before reaching the switch, and all vehicles approaching the failed junction would be affected.|$|R

2500|$|On April 12, 2001, the Ocean train {{originating}} at Halifax {{destined for}} Montréal derailed at a manually operated main <b>track</b> <b>switch</b> in Stewiacke, Nova Scotia. A standard Canadian National (CN) switch lock used {{to secure the}} switch in correct position had been tampered with. The two locomotives and the first two cars continued on the main track, but the following cars took a diverging route onto an industrial track adjacent to the main track. Nine of the cars derailed and a farm supply building, {{as well as the}} industrial track were destroyed. Four occupants of the building escaped without injury prior to impact. There were 132 persons on board the train. Twenty-two persons were transported to hospital in either Truro or Halifax. Nine were seriously injured. [...] A 15-year-old boy pleaded guilty to the charge of mischief endangering life relating to the lock tampering.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal IFAC-Papers OnLine and the definitive published version is available at [URL] <b>track</b> <b>switches,</b> {{commonly referred to as}} ‘turnouts’ or ‘points,’ are a necessary element of any rail network.

The novel design meets the set of functional requirements for <b>track</b> <b>switching</b> solutions, in addition to offering several features that the current designs are unable to offer, in particular to enable multi-channel actuation and rail locking, and provide a degree of fault tolerance. This paper describes the design and operation of this switching concept, from requirements capture and solution generation through to the construction of the laboratory demonstrator. The novel concept is contrasted with the design and operation of the ‘traditional’ switch design.

5000|$|The longest set {{of points}} {{in the world was}} {{installed}} in Bitterfeld station in January 1998.

50|$|The {{switching}} {{arrangement was}} remarkably simple. In {{addition to an}} ordinary <b>track</b> <b>switch,</b> in which, however, the switch bar is made to throw only one rail, a connection was made {{by means of a}} vertical rod and upper switch bar with a shifting section of the guide rail, whereby, on the moving of the track rail and the setting of the signal, the guide rail was simultaneously moved, the adjustment being effected and both being locked in position according to the methods usual in ordinary railway practice.|$|E
50|$|Electric trams use various {{devices to}} collect power from {{overhead}} lines. The most common device found {{today is the}} pantograph, while some older systems use trolley poles or bow collectors. Ground-level power supply has become a recent innovation. Another new technology uses supercapacitors; when an insulator at a <b>track</b> <b>switch</b> cuts off power from the tram for a short distance along the line, the tram can use energy stored in a large capacitor to drive the tram past {{the gap in the}} power feed. A rather obsolete system for power supply is conduit current collection.|$|E
