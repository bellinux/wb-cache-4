It defined eligibility for a civil partnership {{and the process of}} registering a civil partnership. Rather than listing all the rights of a civil partner, it specified that all the rights of marriage would apply <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> a civil partnership. However, it specifically defined the dissolution process and the process for recognising foreign civil partnerships.|$|E
5|$|Lunalilo left no heirs. The {{legislature}} was {{empowered by}} the constitution to elect the monarch in these instances and chose David Kalākaua as the next monarch. The new ruler was pressured by the U.S. government to surrender Pearl Harbor to the Navy. Kalākaua was concerned that this would lead to annexation by the U.S. and to the contravening of {{the traditions of the}} Hawaiian people, who believed that the land ('Āina) was fertile, sacred, and not for sale <b>to</b> <b>anyone.</b> <b>In</b> 1875, the United States Congress agreed to an additional seven years of reciprocity in exchange for Ford Island. At the end of the seven-year reciprocity agreement, the United States showed little interest in renewal.|$|E
5|$|A free buffet for {{servicemen}} {{was provided}} {{at the station}} during both World Wars. The Preston Station Free Buffet Association served free hot drinks, biscuits and buns and sold sandwiches at cost price <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> uniform 24 {{hours a day for}} the duration of the First World War. Four hundred women working 12-hour shifts served over 3million men between 1915 and 1919. 12million cups of tea were served between 1939 and 1945. It was funded by subscription and had its own marked crockery. The station was on a major north-south route for troops. There are three commemorative plaques related to the First World War buffet in the waiting room on platforms 3 and 4, the former site of WWI buffet. One of the drama segments of the televised Preston Passion of 2012 was set in the First World War servicemen's buffet. The Second World War buffet was located in the southern building further down platforms 5&6 (now platforms 3&4).|$|E

5|$|The academy {{was formed}} as a not-for-profit company in 1999 and officially opened on 1 April 2000. It {{occupied}} converted naval premises until a clubhouse was built, which was opened in June 2005 by the Princess Royal. £7.85 million of funding for the project was donated by charities, individuals and local councils; the National Lottery donated £3 million in 2003, and the South West Regional Development Agency added £3.34 million. The academy's aims are to promote the sport of sailing {{at all levels of}} competence and ability, through courses, training and events, and to contribute to the economic regeneration of the area. Since opening it has created a demand in service and marine industries worth around £10 million. WPNSA continues to promote sailing to local schools, offering benefits such as free boat hoist and storage. Use of the facilities and access to training is open <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> return for an annual membership fee. On 6 July 2005, London was chosen to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and the WPNSA was chosen to host the sailing events.|$|E

25|$|They were regulars on NBC's Monitor, {{often on}} {{stand-by}} {{to go on}} the air at short notice if the program's planned segments developed problems, and they were also heard in a surprising variety of formats and timeslots, from a 15-minute series in mid-afternoon to their hour-long show aired weeknights just before midnight in 1954-55. During that same period, they did an audience participation game show, Pick and Play with Bob and Ray, which was short-lived. It came at a time when network pages filled seats for radio-TV shows by giving tickets <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> the street, and on Pick and Play the two comics were occasionally booed by audience members unfamiliar with the Bob and Ray comedy style.|$|E
25|$|The leather dog collar {{found on}} Tiernan's body was {{manufactured}} {{by a company}} based in Nottingham who sold it to 220 separate wholesalers.

The 112th company contacted was a Liverpool-based mail order company called Pets Pyjamas who confirmed that they had made three sales in the area, and emailed a list to DC Wilson. Taylor's name {{was one of the}} customers, and this was immediately flagged up for attention as a name previously provided following the appeal by Det. Supt. Gregg. This was a major breakthrough for the investigation which now considered Taylor the prime suspect and the police exercised a search warrant at his home.|$|E

25|$|The {{case has}} been {{called one of the}} most {{important}} of the late 20th century, since it freed nationally chartered banks to offer credit cards <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. they deemed qualified, and more specifically because it allowed them to export credit card interest rates to states with stricter regulations, opening up a race between states in an effort to attract lending institutions to set up shop in their states and offer a wider variety of consumer credit products. Over the next decade, the states accelerated a process that had already begun of repealing or loosening their anti-usury laws, allowing state-chartered banks to compete more equally with national ones. As a result, the use of credit cards has vastly increased, and since the mortgage industry soon followed suit, the issuance of subprime mortgages also increased drastically, facilitating the housing bubble that led to the 2008 housing crisis.|$|E
25|$|An Iraqi {{survivor}} {{from the}} same boat, Zainab Abbas, who also lost two children from the disaster, told reporters that Abdullah had been presented to her as the 'captain', that he was driving the overcrowded boat too fast, causing it to flip over, and that he pleaded with her {{while they were still}} both in the water not to report him <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> authority. Abbas said her family escaped out of Baghdad from ISIS and she was angry because all the media attention was on Aylan Kurdi and Abdullah Kurdi and not on her family. She later returned to Baghdad and said her dead children's bodies had not been correctly prepared for burial and called on Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to grant her family asylum so they can escape Islamic State. The Reuters agency reported that interviews with two other passengers in the boat, Iraqis Ahmed Hadi Jawwad (Zainab Abbas's husband), and 22-year-old Amir Haider, corroborated Abbas's account.|$|E

Rolling Stone published an article in which Madonna advocated [...] "intense personal exploration" [...] over drug use. While being asked if [...] "Devil Pray" [...] could run the risk of being misunderstood as a song encouraging drugs, Madonna replied: [...] "I'm certainly not judging people who take drugs or saying 'don't do drugs', however, I'm saying you can do all of these things to connect to a higher level, but ultimately you're going to be lost. People who are getting high are instinctively also trying to connect to a higher level of consciousness, but are doing {{it in a way that}} will not sustain them." ...|$|E
500|$|A 2011 {{article in}} New York Magazine {{described}} {{the company as}} the [...] "largest and indisputably weirdest hedge fund" [...] because of its unwavering commitment to [...] "total honesty and accountability" [...] and minute detail in its corporate culture. For example, Dalio encourages employees to do [...] "whatever {{it takes to make}} the company great" [...] and emphasizes transparency and openness in its decision making processes. All meetings are recorded and can be viewed by any employee as long as the meeting topic is not proprietary. In addition, Dalio says that he fosters [...] "an extreme meritocracy of ideas" [...] and asserts that decisions are made about investments without considerations of hierarchy. He says that any employee can respectfully say anything <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> the firm, but they must be prepared to be challenged in return. The company's flat corporate structure aims to remove the barriers associated with traditional asset management firms, and qualities like stodginess and risk-aversion are discouraged.|$|E
500|$|In 2001 Margaret Morrell and Stephanie Capparell {{presented}} Shackleton as a {{model for}} corporate leadership in their book [...] They wrote: [...] "Shackleton resonates with executives in today's business world. His people-centred approach to leadership can be a guide <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> a position of authority". Other management writers were soon following this lead, using Shackleton as an exemplar for bringing order from chaos. The Centre for Leadership Studies at the University of Exeter (United Kingdom) offers a course on Shackleton, who also features in the management education programmes of several American universities. In Boston a [...] "Shackleton School" [...] was set up on [...] "Outward Bound" [...] principles, with the motto [...] "The Journey is Everything". Shackleton has also been cited {{as a model}} leader by the US Navy, and in a textbook on Congressional leadership, Peter L Steinke calls Shackleton the archetype of the [...] "nonanxious leader" [...] whose [...] "calm, reflective demeanor becomes the antibiotic warning of the toxicity of reactive behaviour". In 2001, the Athy Heritage Centre-Museum, Athy, County Kildare, Ireland, established the Ernest Shackleton Autumn School, which is held annually, to honour the memory of Ernest Shackleton.|$|E

500|$|As the {{territory}} developed, their tasks changed; slaves {{also served as}} household servants and farm workers, {{as in the case}} of William Henry Harrison's slaves. George Rogers Clark's two slaves assisted him in running a gristmill in Clarksville. While the pro-slavery faction was in power, laws were passed permitting anyone to seize and return slaves who were more than ten miles from their home, and a one hundred dollar fine was placed on anyone who helped a slave escape. Some slaves, like [...] "Aunt Fannie", who belonged to Dennis Pennington, refused to be set free. Pennington had freed all his slaves when he left Virginia, but Fannie did not want to be left behind and continued on as a free household servant for the rest of her life. She was buried in the Pennington family cemetery in Corydon, Indiana. Others were not so fortunate {{as in the case of}} another black woman who also lived in Corydon. When she tried to escape from her masters she was run down in the street, beaten, and carried back home. The men threatened death <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> the town, which was strongly anti-slavery, who interfered.|$|E
500|$|The Shins {{were not}} truly a band when James Mercer {{composed}} the song, {{and the idea}} of making music his career seemed uncertain. The song's creation was partially a reaction to the music scene in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the band's hometown, which Mercer described as [...] "macho, really heavy, and aggressive." [...] He characterized it as a punk rock-esque move akin to giving the finger to the entire town. The song was born out of frustration regarding his personal life and future. [...] "It's definitely a moment in my life, that sort of angst and confusion about what my future was going to be," [...] he remarked. He described it as a [...] "Saturn return" [...] period of his life, in which he felt he could not relate <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> his hometown and his life there had become depressing. He had become a [...] "hermit" [...] working on the band's debut album, Oh, Inverted World, and had lost interest in partying with friends. The line [...] "Gold teeth and a curse for this town" [...] refers to his songwriting talent and his feelings on Albuquerque.|$|E
500|$|There was no duty {{to report}} a death <b>to</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>in</b> authority. Instead, each parish {{appointed}} two or more 'searchers of the dead', whose duty was to inspect a corpse and {{determine the cause of}} death. A searcher was entitled to charge a small fee from relatives for each death they reported, and so habitually the parish would appoint someone to the post who would otherwise be destitute and would be receiving support from the parish poor rate. Typically, this meant searchers would be old women who were illiterate, might know little about identifying diseases and who would be open to dishonesty. Searchers would typically learn about a death either from the local sexton who had been asked to dig a grave, or from the tolling of a church bell. Anyone who did not report a death to their local church, such as Quakers, Anabaptists, other non-Anglican Christians or Jews, frequently did not get included in the official records. Searchers during times of plague were required to live apart [...] from the community and stay indoors except when performing their duties, for fear of spreading the diseases. Outside they should avoid other people and always carry a white stick to warn of their occupation. Searchers reported to the Parish Clerk, who made a return each week to the Company of Parish Clerks in Brode Lane. Figures were then passed to the Lord Mayor and then to the Minister of State once plague became a matter of national concern. The reported figures were used to compile the Bills of Mortality, which listed total deaths in each parish and whether by plague. The system of Searchers to report the cause of death continued until 1836.|$|E
