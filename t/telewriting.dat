5000|$|First {{experimental}} developments at the Open University of {{what became}} the Cyclops system - then called a <b>telewriting</b> or audio-graphic system but nowadays would be called a whiteboard system - under two separate teams in the Faculties of Mathematics (Read and Bacsich) and Technology (Pinches and Liddell) - the first team focusing on storage on cassette tape of digital data to drive VDUs, the second focusing on transmission of handwriting over telephone lines. There were similar developments {{under way in the}} US and France.|$|E

British Journal of Educational Technology, 14(2), pp. 109-126. Paper describes the CYCLOPS system, developed at the Open University UK in the early 1980s, which provides multi-site tutoring through a shared whiteboard system providing voice conferencing combined with synchronous handwriting and real-time annotation of downloaded graphics. A more comprehensive set of six short papers describing Cyclops was published in Media in Education and Development vol. 16 no. 2, June 1983, pp. 58-74.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an audio teleconferencing system enhanced with a microcomputer-based <b>telewriting</b> system and examines its application {{in the delivery}} of university courses in statistics, microcomputer applications in special education, nursing issues, introductory writing, and staff development for teachers. The actual application of the technology in these courses is examined in order to demonstrate the versatility of the technology and the range of instructional designs possible with the telewriter. Instructional strategies used in the courses are described and the interrelationship between instructional strategies and subject matter is explored in each case. In conclusion, the paper notes the following instructional issues arising from the experiences described: (1) using the celewriter requires considerable advance preparation; (2) inst-uctors found effective new ways to use th...|$|E
40|$|MCLGallery is a C++ {{library with}} visual {{component}} templates to allow easy manipulation of multimedia data, real-time data transfer across networks and rapid prototyping in Windows 95. The design philosophy of MCLGallery is to enable researchers to prototype, develop, and implement applications ready for industrial and commercial audiences, while focusing the programming on the research, not {{the complexities of}} Windows 95. This is accomplished {{through the use of}} Powersoft 's Power++ component template technology and building a library over powerful Windows 95 multimedia APIs. Introduction The Multimedia Communications Laboratory (MCL) at Memorial University is a recently founded research lab, investigating a broad spectrum of topics in the domain of multimedia communications, such as face tracking, <b>telewriting,</b> augmented reality, telemedicine, face recognition, and image coding. Driving this research is the major goal of the rapid transfer of research results into demonstration system [...] ...|$|E
