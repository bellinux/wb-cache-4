5|$|The {{dearth of}} {{artefacts}} recovered from Buckton Castle, {{and the lack}} of finely finished stonework, might indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> was never finished, however the re-cutting of the ditch suggests either an extended period of occupancy of abandonment followed by repairs to the fortifications.|$|E
5|$|The terrain amplified the {{importance}} of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains extending as far south as Georgia, creating the near-impassable mountainous terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> commanded.|$|E

5|$|Although {{investigation}} of Preclassic remains is difficult at Motul de San José {{due to the}} overlying Late Classic construction, it is evident <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> experienced major growth during the Late Preclassic (300 BCAD 300) and became a sizeable centre. At roughly the same time, {{most of the major}} structures were built at Akte, and Chakokot experienced its earliest occupation during the Late Preclassic. In contrast, Buena Vista appears to have been lightly occupied. La Trinidad de Nosotros also underwent major expansion in the Late Preclassic and became larger and more important than Motul de San José, with its architectural layout being finalised in this period – later Classic period construction was superimposed upon pre-existing Late Preclassic structures.|$|E
5|$|Controversy over Kampoeng Rawa had {{developed}} by late 2012, when the Water Resource Management Agency declared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> was illegally {{located in the}} green belt around Lake Rawa Pening. In 2013, the ecologist Sudharto of Diponegoro University stated that the area around Rawa Pening had to be clear of all buildings, otherwise the water flow and ecosystem would be disturbed. It was {{also found that the}} permits for the establishment had not been obtained. However, the Regent of Semarang, Sudharto, was supportive of Kampoeng Rawa, stating that the complex not only improved the welfare of the farmers and fishermen, but stopped feuds over the use of rice paddies in the area.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that during the}} Iron Age people farmed the fields and mined the iron-rich rocks in the Tunbridge Wells area, and excavations in 1940 and 1957–61 by James Money at High Rocks uncovered {{the remains of a}} defensive hill-fort. It is thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> was occupied into the era of Roman Britain, and the area continued {{to be part of the}} Wealden iron industry until its demise in the late eighteenth century. An iron forge remains in the grounds of Bayham Abbey, in use until 1575 and documented until 1714.|$|E

5|$|George Wimpey became Taylor Wimpey {{through a}} {{corporate}} merger and submitted an application in 2010 {{to build a}} further 15 homes on the site. A report by the London Borough of Hillingdon's planning department rejected the proposal in December that year on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> was already overdeveloped. Local residents had raised this concern in November that year, which {{the leader of the}} council explained was out of the council's control due to planning laws.|$|E
5|$|In 1722 Sir Thomas Webster {{bought the}} castle. For over a century, Bodiam Castle and its {{associated}} manor descended through the Webster family. It was in this period <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> became popular as an early kind of tourist attraction because of its connection with the medieval period. The first drawings of Bodiam Castle date from the mid-18th century, when it was depicted as a ruin overgrown with ivy. Ruins and medieval buildings such as Bodiam Castle served as an inspiration for the revival in Gothic architecture and the renovation of old structures.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, local clandestine {{treasure}} hunters digging at the Eshmun Temple site haphazardly discovered inscriptions carved {{onto the}} temple's walls. This discovery stirred {{the interest of}} Theodore Macridy, curator of the Museum of Constantinople, who cleared the temple remains between 1901 and 1903. Wilhelm Von Landau also excavated the site between 1903 and 1904. In 1920, Gaston Contenau headed a team of archaeologists who surveyed the temple complex. The first extensive archaeological excavation revealing the Eshmun Temple remains was undertaken by Maurice Dunand between 1963 and 1975. Archaeological evidence shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> was occupied from the seventh century BC to the eighth century AD.|$|E

5|$|In 1964 {{the stones}} {{in the circle}} were {{disturbed}} by agricultural activity. It was then decided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> would be excavated, a project which was ordered by the Ministry of Public Building and Works and carried out in May 1965 under the directorship of Geoffrey J.

5|$|In 1981, {{the site}} was {{proposed}} for commercial development, provoking an energetic campaign by the Chiswick Wildlife Group, formed in March 1982, which became the local branch of the London Wildlife Trust. The threat to {{the site was}} one of the first to be highlighted by the London Wildlife Trust on its formation in October 1981. The campaign led to a Public Inquiry in July 1983, which determined <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> should be devoted to nature conservation. This was the first time anywhere in the United Kingdom that a Public Inquiry had ruled in favour of nature in a city, and the Gunnersbury Triangle example became a test case.|$|E
