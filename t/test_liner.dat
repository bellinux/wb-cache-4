40|$|Several {{enhancements}} {{that improve}} the accuracy and robustness of an impedance eduction technique that use an automatic optimizer are presented. These enhancements are {{then used to}} launch an intensive investiga-tion into the cause of anomalous behavior that occurs for {{a small number of}} test conditions. This anomalous behavior is investigated for both a hardwall insert and a conventional liner. The primary conclusions of the study are that: (1) for the hard wall insert, the anomalies are due to narrow peaks in the objective function, (2) For the conventional liner, the anomalies are due to the presence of an extremely flat objective function, and (3) the anomalies appear to be triggered by inconsistencies between the duct propagation model and the measured data. At high frequencies, the duct propagation model may need to include the effects of higher-order duct modes, whereas at low frequencies, the effects of the mean boundary layer may have to be included.

These activities will be focused on the intense demand of chemical and biochemical strategies to enhance bonding within paper and paperboard. Nowadays, on average, 55 % of fibrous compositions for papermaking are made of recycled fibers. In this field, about 65 - 70 % are fibrous compositions intended to be used for packaging papermaking. Corrugated cardboard {{is one of the most}} significant examples, since it is made of fluting (internal part) and <b>test</b> <b>liner</b> (external part). In <b>test</b> <b>liner</b> mills, fibrous compositions are made of 50 % paper cuts from the cardboard industry and the rest of other types of paper and cardboard. Some <b>test</b> <b>liner</b> papers have low content of mineral fillers. While recycling, fibers get damaged due to the hornification phenomena and mechanical refining of the pulp (with the purpose of enhancing the mechanical properties). The producer does not have many alternatives to address this situation: to increase the quality of the pulp, to slightly refine the pulp or to add some chemical additives that enhance mechanical properties. One strategy or alternative to this situation could be biorefining processes of the pulp. The present work aims to biorefine a pulp made of recycled fibers with the purpose of restoring the mechanical properties of the industrial <b>test</b> <b>liner</b> or improving them and making possible the addition of mineral fillers in order to decrease the production costs.

40|$|An {{impedance}} eduction technique, previously validated for ducts with plane {{waves at}} the source and duct termination planes, has been extended to support higher-order modes at these locations. Inputs for this method are the acoustic pressures along the source and duct termination planes, and along a microphone array located in a wall either adjacent or opposite to the <b>test</b> <b>liner.</b> A second impedance eduction technique is then presented that {{eliminates the need for}} the microphone array. The integrity of both methods is tested using three sound sources, six Mach numbers, and six selected frequencies. Results are presented for both a hardwall and a <b>test</b> <b>liner</b> (with known impedance) consisting of a perforated plate bonded to a honeycomb core. The primary conclusion of the study is that the second method performs well in the presence of higher-order modes and flow. However, the first method performs poorly when most of the microphones are located near acoustic pressure nulls. The negative effects of the acoustic pressure nulls can be mitigated by a judicious choice of the mode structure in the sound source. The paper closes by using the first impedance eduction method to design a rectangular array of 32 microphones for accurate impedance eduction in the NASA LaRC Curved Duct Test Rig in the presence of expected measurement uncertainties, higher order modes, and mean flow.

40|$|A 2 -D {{impedance}} eduction methodology {{is extended}} to quasi- 3 -D sound fields in uniform or shearing mean flow. We introduce a nonlocal, nonreflecting boundary condition {{to terminate the}} duct and then educe the impedance by minimizing an objective function. The introduction of a parallel, sparse, equation solver significantly reduces the wall clock time for educing the impedance when {{compared to that of}} the sequential band solver used in the 2 -D methodology. The accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the methodology is demonstrated using two examples. In the first example, we show that the method reproduces the known impedance of a ceramic tubular <b>test</b> <b>liner.</b> In the second example, we illustrate that the approach educes the impedance of a four-segment liner where the first, second, and fourth segments consist of a perforated face sheet bonded to honeycomb, and the third segment is a cut from the ceramic tubular <b>test</b> <b>liner.</b> The ability of the method to educe the impedances of multisegmented liners has the potential to significantly reduce the amount of time and cost required to determine the impedance of several uniform liners by allowing them to be placed in series in the test section and to educe the impedance of each segment using a single numerical experiment. Finally, we probe the objective function in great detail and show that it contains a single minimum.

The mean flow is permitted flow gradients in both cross-sectional directions of the tube. The unknown admittance value is obtained by solving an eigenvalue problem. This eigenvalue problem results from the application of the finite-element method to the partial differential equation and boundary conditions governing the acoustic field. The credibility of the method is established by comparing results with exact solutions obtained for a constant mean-flow profile and with previous results for cases involving shear in only one cross-sectional direction.

The NASA technique relies on an objective function built on acoustic pressure measurements located on the wall opposite the <b>test</b> <b>liner,</b> and the propagation code solves the convected Helmholtz equation in uniform ow using a finite element method that implements a continuous Galerkin discretization. The ONERA method uses an objective function based either on wall acoustic pressure or on acoustic velocity acquired above the liner by Laser Doppler Anemometry, and the propagation code solves the linearized Euler equations by a discontinuous Galerkin discretization. Two acoustic liners are tested in both ONERA and NASA ow ducts and the measured data are treated with the corresponding impedance eduction method. The first liner is a wire mesh facesheet mounted onto a honeycomb core, designed to be linear with respect to incident sound pressure level and to grazing ow velocity.

The evaluation is performed at three centerline Mach numbers, using data acquired in a grazing flow impedance tube, using both upstream and downstream propagating sound sources, and on a database of <b>test</b> <b>liners</b> for which the expected behavior of the impedance spectra is known. The <b>test</b> <b>liners</b> are a hard-wall insert consisting of 12. 6 mm thick aluminum, a linear liner without a facesheet consisting {{of a number of}} small diameter but long cylindrical channels embedded in a ceramic material, and two conventional nonlinear liners consisting of a perforated facesheet bonded to a honeycomb core. The study is restricted to a frequency range for which only plane waves are cut on in the hard-wall sections of the flow impedance tube. The metrics used to evaluate each boundary condition are 1) how well it educes the same impedance for upstream and downstream propagating sources, and 2) how well it predicts the expected behavior of the impedance spectra over the Mach number range. The primary conclusions of the study are that the same impedance is educed for upstream and downstream propagating sources except at the highest Mach number, that an effective impedance based on both the upstream and downstream measurements is more accurate than an impedance based on the upstream or downstream data alone, and that the Ingard-Myers boundary condition with an effective impedance produces results similar to that achieved with the modified Ingard-Myers boundary condition...|$|R

The Curved Duct Test Rig (CDTR) has been developed at NASA Langley Research Center to investigate sound propagation through a duct of comparable size (approximately the gap of GE 90) and physical characteristics to the aft bypass duct of typical aircraft engines. The liner test section is designed to mimic the outer/inner walls of an engine exhaust bypass duct that has been unrolled circumferentially. Experiments to investigate the effect of curvature along the flow path on the acoustic performance of a <b>test</b> <b>liner</b> are performed in the CDTR and reported in this paper. Flow paths investigated include both straight and curved with offsets from the inlet to the discharge plane of and 1 duct width, respectively. The test liners are installed on the side walls of the liner test section. The liner samples are perforate over honeycomb core, which design is typical of liners installed in aircraft nacelles. In addition to fully treated side walls, combinations of treated and acoustically rigid walls are investigated. While curvature in the hard wall duct is found not to reduce the incident sound significantly, it does cause mode scattering. It is found that asymmetry of liner treatment causes scattering of the incident mode into less attenuated modes, which degrades the overall liner attenuation. It is also found that symmetry of liner treatment enhances liner performance by eliminating scattering into less attenuated modes. Comparisons of measured liner attenuation with numerical results predicted by an analytic model based on the parabolic approximation (CDUCT-LaRC) have also been made and are reported in this paper.

Rainbow testing of TBC's on turbine nozzles, shrouds, and buckets are described {{along with a}} <b>test</b> on combustor <b>liners.</b> GEPG has conducted over 15 machine tests with TBC coated turbine nozzles of various coatings. TBC performance has been quite good and additional testing, including TBC's on shrouds and buckets, is continuing. Included is a brief comparison of TBC requirements for power generation and aircraft turbines...|$|R
30|$|The {{correlation}} between the wear behavior of a heavy commercial vehicle (HCV) brake <b>liner</b> <b>tested</b> under controlled laboratory conditions and that in actual field conditions is investigated. A brake liner study for friction and wear is performed on an inertia brake dynamometer (IBD) at different temperatures (200 °C, 250 °C, and 300 °C) using 6000 brake actuations in a laboratory. The total wear loss of the brake liner at three different temperatures for 6000 brake actuations in IBD {{is found to be}} 1.12 mm. The actual field test is conducted on four different HCVs, namely, a city bus (CB), a high speed bus (HSB), a highway truck (HWT), and a tipper lorry (TL). These HCVs run at different terrain/traffic conditions and load conditions. When comparing the predicted life of the brake liner through the IBD test with the actual life of the brake liner in different HCVs, a vast difference is observed. Due to the large variation of liner life observed between the actual and predicted tests, an extensive field test is conducted. In the field <b>test,</b> the <b>liner</b> with identical formulation is fitted in the four types of HCVs. The predicted life of the liner using IBD is then correlated with the field test observation and a correlation factor is determined. Based on this correlation factor, the predicted life of the liner and the achieved life on the HCV are found to be fairly close. This study will be useful to design the friction material formulation and to predict the actual life of the brake liner for various HCVs.|$|R
40|$|Wear {{and fatigue}} of {{polyethylene}} acetabular cups {{have been reported}} {{to play a role in}} the failure of total hip replacements. Edge loading of hip replacements can occur where there is sub-optimal component positioning and/or joint laxity. Wear resistance can be improved by crosslinking but the manufacturing process of these materials involves post-irradiation thermal treatments to recombine free radicals and to stabilise the materials. Stabilisation can also be achieved by adding antioxidants. Material degradation due to oxidation and manufacturing process can result in rim cracking and/or fracture due to a reduction in mechanical properties and this has been observed in vivo. A requirement for pre-clinical hip simulator testing under edge loading conditions for all of these materials has therefore been identified. This thesis describes the development and evaluation of a hip simulator edge loading protocol using accelerated aged conventional UHMWPE acetabular liners as positive controls and commercially available crosslinked UHMWPE acetabular liners as negative controls. The edge loading protocol was then used to evaluate antioxidant stabilised liners in hip simulator tests. Explanted UHMWPE acetabular liners were evaluated for wear and damage mechanisms and compared with the damage observed on the hip simulator <b>tested</b> <b>liners</b> and new methodologies were developed to measure and analyse these explanted liners. The edge loading protocol produced cracking and subsurface damage in the aged UHMWPE liners but not in the non-aged crosslinked liners. Rim deformation was observed on all liners and the volume change produced was reduced under edge loading conditions for both types of UHMWPE liner. The antioxidant liners performed as well as the commercially available crosslinked liner in hip simulator tests and the rim deformation that was observed on explanted liners was replicated under edge loading conditions in the hip simulator tests. The edge loading protocol can be used in the future to test a range of UHMWPE materials, including aged materials, and explant analysis using the methodologies developed in this study can be used to inform the design of future simulator tests...|$|R
40|$|Trenchless {{renovation}} {{has been}} in operation since the 1970 ’s in North America and the United Kingdom. However, {{it has not been}} widely accepted due to cost effectiveness concerns. Many Canadian cities are faced with the problem of aging and deteriorating water distribution network due to one or a combination of pipe breaks, leakages, or aesthetic water quality problems, resulting from aging and internal corrosion. Various polymer-based products such as Cured-in Place Pipe (CIPP) lining have been widely employed in structural water main rehabilitation applications. On the other hand, only a few technologies deal with non-structural systems, usually meant to serve as barrier coatings thereby protecting the iron water mains. This thesis presents the results of a laboratory testing program designed to investigate the renewal of potable water mains via the use of polyurea and epoxy-polyurethane lining in two separate locations in Ontario. The effectiveness of using these polymeric linings are investigated, available and new cleaning technologies are discussed, and thereafter properties of the <b>tested</b> <b>liner</b> material are verified. There are two primary objectives for this research. They include 1) evaluation of the lining products, which are installed using new technologies, and 2) development of testing protocol to address construction Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) concerns for the new technologies. Employing a spray-on liner in trenchless technology applications provide several challenges including unknown pipe life, unknown corrosion rate in pipes, and pipe-liner material interaction (in form of bond). This research incorporated some trial sites to gather field data related to the primary objectives described above. The trial site is located at the 3 M Oxford street facility, located in London, Canada. The field installation of liners into pipe sections are put into practical demonstration and samples are tested for as per quality control. Finally, it is concluded that using an effective pipe cleaning method eradicates lining faults and improves adhesion to the host pipe. Also, a strategic QA/QC test protocol is developed...|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} of plane waves and higher order acoustic modes {{in a circular}} multisectioned duct was studied. A unique source array consisting of two concentric rings of sources, providing phase and amplitude control in the radial, as well as circumferential direction, was developed to generate plane waves and both spinning and nonspinning higher order modes. Measurements of attenuation and radial mode shapes were taken with finite length liners between the hard wall sections of an anechoically terminated duct. Materials <b>tested</b> as <b>liners</b> included a glass fiber material and both sintered fiber metals and perforated sheet metals with a honeycomb backing. The fundamental acoustic properties of these materials were studied with emphasis on the attenuation of sound by the liners and the determination of local versus extended reaction behavior for the boundary condition. The experimental results were compared with a mathematical model for the multisectioned duct...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of liner material constitutive modeling parameters {{based on the}} results of four EFP <b>tests,</b> with different <b>liner</b> geometry's, is described in this paper. This paper presents an approach for determining an "appropriate set" of material parameters to describe the deviatoric behavior of the liner material. The Johnson-Cook and Steinberg-Guinan constitutive models are evaluated with the Steinberg model shown to be more suitable because of its upper limit on the flow stress. A set of flow stress hardening parameters are found that provide excellent correlation to the four different EFP warhead design configurations...|$|R
