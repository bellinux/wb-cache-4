25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first. We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid I have to put my foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought â€” let's just make one album.|$|E
25|$|However, the B-25's as {{high level}} bombers were flying without escort fighters. Although better armed were still treated badly by swarms of Zeros. On 24 May 6 B-25s {{attacked}} Lae Airfield {{and one of}} them came back. Harassing missions were flown out of Jackson Field with the A-24s until 29 July when an eight ship convoy was spotted 50 miles north of Buna, Papua New Guinea. Five of seven A-24s that had taken off to attack the convoy were shot down by enemy fighter planes. They initially had an escort of P-39's. Somewhere over the Owen Stanley Mountains they lost their escort and decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> out them. Subsequently, they ran into 24 Japanese fighters over Buna. In the succeeding battle against overwhelming Zero odds and shattering anti-aircraft fire the Squadron suffered heavy losses.|$|E

The Evening Herald reviewer {{called it an}} [...] "entertaining, tightly-packaged edition" [...] of the show but also opined, [...] "Where Scannal stumbled, however, was in its failure <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> both feet on the cringe-inducing elephant in the room: John Delaney's embarrassing plea to Fifa boss, the odious Sepp Blatter, to let Ireland be [...] "the 33rd team" [...] at the World Cup".|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{brought all}} that on yourself. You had no {{business}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> those two thieves. If you had remained honest {{there would have been}} no call for you to run away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{might offer}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the general," [...] March suggested, {{and the men}} {{apparently}} {{thought this was a}} joke. Mrs. March did not laugh in her feminine worry about ways and means.|$|E
60|$|After some further conference, Mr. Bucket (whom {{everybody}} {{seemed to}} know and defer <b>to)</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the others at a door and left me in the carriage, while the driver {{walked up and down}} by his horses to warm himself. The tide was coming in, as I judged from the sound it made, and I could hear it break {{at the end of the}} alley with a little rush towards me. It never did so--and I thought it did so, hundreds of times, in what can have been at the most a quarter of an hour, and probably was less--but the thought shuddered through me that it would cast my mother at the horses' feet.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Vifa {{announced}} its first wireless speaker, Copenhagen, which uses textiles by the Danish textile manufacturer, Kvadrat, and supports Apple Airplay.

60|$|The Bon Ton Store--big as four barns--my! {{it would}} simply scare a person <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> there, <b>with</b> {{seven or eight}} clerks all looking at you. And the men's suits, on figures just like human. And Axel Egge's, like home, lots of Swedes and Norskes in there, and a card of dandy buttons, like rubies.|$|R
60|$|He {{stepped on}} to the pavement, and {{assisted}} her to alight. The thought of leaving her so abruptly was painful to him, and yet he dreaded to hear her invite him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> her; nevertheless, she did so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{should get}} along," [...] said Mrs. Saunders with the lazy piety {{which had never}} yet found Providence to fail it. [...] "I should get Miss Snively <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> me, here. She ain't making out very well, alone, and she could be company to me {{in more ways than}} one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my Concho, {{but suppose}} I take the fight off your hands. Now, here's a proposition: I will get {{half a dozen}} Americanos <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> you. You {{will have to get}} money to work the mine,--you will need funds. You shall share half with them. They will take the risk, raise the money, and protect you." ...|$|E

60|$|This {{was very}} true. The wheel {{did not seem}} to be injured, but still I could not travel without a tire. This was the most {{satisfactory}} feature of the affair.

5000|$|... "I've got <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> Rock. It's all right. I'm not afraid. Some time, Rock, {{when the}} team is up against it, when things are wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, ask them <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> there <b>with</b> all they've got and win just one for the Gipper.

6000|$|... "The fact is, {{the idea}} came into my head last fall when I went up to Superior. My partner wanted me <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> him on some land, and I did.

60|$|This {{was all so}} {{pleasant}} that I hope it made {{me still}} more like the mountain than I had been before.

6000|$|... "Calthy, this {{is truly}} like old times," [...] he said.

6000|$|I {{replied that}} it was, and invited him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> me to supper. The Sergeant {{remained}} in his place, {{and said something}} about enjoying {{the smell of the}} garden at night. I left him to his enjoyment. Just as I was turning in at the door, I heard [...] "The Last Rose of Summer" [...] at the wicket-gate. Sergeant Cuff had made another discovery!

60|$|I shall {{always be}} ashamed {{of the way that}} woman wheedled the Altrurian, when we found him the next morning, walking up and down the piazza, before breakfast--that is, it was before our breakfast; when we asked him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> us, he said he had just had his breakfast, and was waiting for Reuben Camp, who had promised to take him up as he passed with a load of hay for one of the hotels in the village.|$|E
6000|$|Joan offered <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> and sit <b>with</b> the invalid. But Mary {{feared the}} {{exertion}} of talking {{might be too}} much for him. [...] "He gets so excited," [...] she explained. She slipped out noiselessly.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{word for}} this town (Used {{by many people}} to-date)was Mucakuthi. The founding chief's name was Gutu (Kikuyu word for Ear).
