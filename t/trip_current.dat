An announcement of Chavez's death was made in the middle of the band's performance in a children's music school, putting an abrupt end to the show and the rest of the performance itinerary. The Ciegos continued performing until the late Summer of 2013 before officially going on hiatus. The hiatus was short-lived, however, as due to popular demand, the Ciegos decided to put their differences aside and resume performing in late 2014.|$|E
5000|$|A {{polymeric}} PTC {{device is}} made up of a non-conductive crystalline organic polymer matrix that is loaded with carbon black particles to make it conductive. While cool, the polymer is in a crystalline state, with the carbon forced into the regions between crystals, forming many conductive chains. Since it is conductive (the [...] "initial resistance"), it will pass a current. If too much current is passed through the device the device will begin to heat. As the device heats, the polymer will expand, changing from a crystalline into an amorphous state. The expansion separates the carbon particles and breaks the conductive pathways, causing the device to heat faster and expand more, further raising the resistance. [...] This increase in resistance substantially reduces the current in the circuit. A small current still flows through the device and is sufficient to maintain the temperature at a level which will keep it in the high resistance state. The device can be said to have latching functionality. The hold current is the maximum current at which the device is guaranteed not to trip. The <b>trip</b> <b>current</b> is the current at which the device is guaranteed to trip.|$|E
5000|$|Fig. 3 shows {{a typical}} Pulses Plus schematic. The pack {{includes}} diodes in each branch {{to minimize the}} possibility of reverse charging the cells. PTCs, or positive temperature coefficient thermistors act as resettable fuses. PTCs begin to get warm at a <b>trip</b> <b>current.</b> The warmth increases their resistance which produces even more heat, and the PTC quickly [...] "trips" [...] and shuts off most of the current. The PTC rarely trips in a typical ADCP pack, because the safety circuit is the primary protection against short circuits (defined to be any current above about 8 A). The safety circuit also turns off the pack before its voltage falls below a threshold. If the pack were allowed to fully discharge, one branch could discharge before the others, {{which could lead to}} the discharged branch being charged by the remaining cells. Any attempt to charge a lithium cell is potentially dangerous, and turning the pack off at about 75-80% of its starting voltage prevents this from happening. At this voltage, only around 3% of the capacity remains, but the remaining capacity still allows years for disposal of the pack before it discharges fully.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the {{behavior}} of residual current devices at frequencies higher than the rated one. Many experiments are carried out by measuring <b>tripping</b> <b>current</b> and time of devices of different typology, produced by different manufacturers. The attention is mainly devoted to verify the sat- isfaction of the current-time safety curve at high frequency and experiment tripping and immunity to unwanted tripping in the presence of harmonics. Conduced tests show that the behavior of residual current devices at high frequency is strongly influenced by their typology rather than the values assumed by their phys- ical parameters. In addition, a mathematical model is developed, and simulations are compared with measurements showing satis- factory agreement in the entire frequency range under study...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 100 - 102). Smart grid plays a vital role to protect electrical load and utilities among electrical power consumers due to its wide range of advantages which in turn made up its growing demand in current world. Mostly, electrical loads are venerable to fault current in the system results in sudden failure of expensive loads which is needed to be detached for safety reason. Therefore, this paper mainly focuses on designing the circuit in generating a fictitious fault current and its detection through WiMAX communication so as to detach the load from power generation unit using Matlab Simulink. In order for transmission of fault or <b>trip</b> <b>current</b> through wireless communication system, a WiMAX transceiver IEEE STD 802. 16 d has been designed, implemented and optimized for <b>trip</b> <b>current</b> transmission and receiption to certain distant places circuit breakers located in different HV and LV distribution system. Moreover, an automatic back-up system has been proposed to provide an uninterruptable power to the utilities/load during when the fault current occurs. Finally, the simulation result shows a successful transmission and detection of fault signal along with its impact in load end is evaluated for overall performance of the designed system.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports the}} design and {{experimental}} demonstration of a novel bi-directional solid-state disconnect (SSD) based on Silicon Carbide (SiC) depletion-mode junction field effect transistors (JFETs) for protecting critical sensitive components in high power systems. The SSD is able to provide a fast disconnect action upon receiving a preset <b>trip</b> <b>current</b> flowing through it and has a very low insertion loss, which makes it suitable for high power applications. For the application in 150 kW six-phase power inverter systems, an insertion loss of less than 0. 91 % and a current fall time of less than 20 µs for trip currents of about 800 A have been demonstrated experimentally. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there are no other solid-state disconnects available of comparable parameters...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{discrete}} choice Random Utility Maximization (RUM) {{models of}} recreation demand ignore {{the influence of}} knowledge, or site capital, gained over past <b>trips</b> on <b>current</b> site choice, despite its obvious impact. We develop a partially dynamic RUM model that incorporates a measure of site capital as an explanatory variable {{in an effort to}} address this shortcoming. To avoid the endogeneity of past and <b>current</b> <b>trip</b> choices, we estimate an auxiliary instrumental variable regression to purge site capital of its correlation with the error terms in current site utility. Our instrumental variable regression gives a fitted value ranging between 0 and 1 for each alternative for each person – a prediction of whether or not a person visited a site. Results suggest that the presence of accumulated site capital is an important predictor of <b>current</b> <b>trips,</b> and that failure to account for site capital will likely lead to underestimates of potential welfare effects. ...|$|R
