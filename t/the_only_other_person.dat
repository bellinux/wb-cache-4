50|$|The Well Tower (Studniční věž), {{being the}} {{logistical}} centerpiece the castle could not function without, {{was the first}} part of the castle to be built. Miners were brought in from the mining town of Kutná Hora, however, water was not encountered even after the depth of the well was 70 m, well below the level of the nearby Berounka river. An underground channel was therefore excavated to bring in water from a nearby stream, yielding a water column of 25 m, sufficient to last for several months. The reservoir had to be manually refilled roughly twice a year by opening a floodgate. Considering the significant strategic weakness incurred to the castle by the lack of an independent water source, the existence of the underground channel was a state secret known <b>only</b> to <b>the</b> Emperor himself, and <b>the</b> burgrave. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>other</b> <b>persons</b> aware of its existence were the miners, who were however allegedly massacred on their way from the castle after the construction, leaving no survivors.|$|R
25|$|Book Nine {{introduces}} {{the details of}} Fyodor's murder and describes the interrogation of Dmitri as he is questioned for the crime he maintains he did not commit. The alleged motive for the crime is robbery. Dmitri was {{known to have been}} completely destitute earlier that evening, but is suddenly seen on the street with thousands of rubles shortly after his father's murder. Meanwhile, the three thousand rubles that Fyodor Karamazov had set aside for Grushenka has disappeared. Dmitri explains that the money he spent that evening came from three thousand rubles Katerina gave him to send to her sister. He spent half that at his first meeting with Grushenka—another drunken orgy—and sewed up the rest in a cloth, intending to give it back to Katerina in the name of honor, he says. The lawyers are not convinced by this. All of the evidence points against Dmitri; <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>other</b> <b>person</b> in the house {{at the time of the}} murder was Smerdyakov, who was incapacitated due to an epileptic seizure he apparently suffered the day before. As a result of the overwhelming evidence against him, Dmitri is formally charged with the patricide and taken away to prison to await trial.|$|E
