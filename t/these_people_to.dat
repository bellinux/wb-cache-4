5|$|When the California Republic was assimilated {{into the}} United States in 1848, American {{settlers}} {{began to move}} into the Santa Ana River region in great numbers. The Mexican ranchos were divided into smaller individual properties, and irrigated agriculture began on a large scale. The city of Santa Ana Viejo, the original location of Santa Ana, was founded in this period. In 1854, Mormons settled in the upper Inland Empire area and started the city of San Bernardino, gaining prosperity by using water from the river, as well as Lytle Creek and Mill Creek, to irrigate crops. The cattle industry began to decline as farms began to replace ranches. Soon, white settlers in the region were more numerous than Hispanics as well. The California Gold Rush around this time was responsible for attracting many of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> the state, but many remained in Southern California afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Despite never moving onto land, Nina's {{proximity}} to Hawaii and the forecasts for an imminent landfall resulted in massive evacuations. An estimated 300people living in Hanapepe and Hanalei {{were forced to}} evacuate when the Hanalei River overflowed its banks. An estimated 1,500people on Kauai were evacuated to higher ground, where the Red Cross had established seven evacuation centers for <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> evacuate to. In addition, thirteen members of the United States Coast Guard were evacuated from low-lying islands and harbors when they were threatened by rising tides triggered by the hurricane {{and the threat of}} flooding forced 420military personnel and families in Waikiki's Ft. Derussy and Ft. Armstrong as well as those living in Ft. Kamehameha, near Pearl Harbor to leave for higher ground. 270 were housed in Tripler Army Hospital and a temporary shelter was opened in Ft. Shafter, both of which were on high ground. In anticipation of Nina, 85 planes were flown away from Barber's Point Naval Air Base to Midway and several commercial flights were cancelled until the storm had passed. There was also concern for the residents of the privately owned Niihau, the closest landmass to the center of Nina and 20miles closer than Kauai. The island's only communications was by boat and most attempts at reaching the island failed due to high surf.|$|E

25|$|One group {{contends that}} the {{ancestors}} of the Taíno came {{from the center of}} the Amazon Basin, and are related to the Yanomama. This is indicated by linguistic, cultural and ceramic evidence. They migrated to the Orinoco valley on the north coast. From there they reached the Caribbean by way of what is now Guyana and Venezuela into Trinidad, proceeding along the Lesser Antilles to Cuba and the Bahamian archipelago. Evidence that supports this theory includes the tracing of the ancestral cultures of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> the Orinoco Valley and their languages to the Amazon Basin.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} the end of March, some Americans were leaving the city. For instance, ten {{families}} departed on March 31. Flights out of Saigon, lightly booked under ordinary circumstances, were full. Throughout April the speed of the evacuation increased, as the Defense Attaché’s Office (DAO) began to fly out nonessential personnel. Many Americans attached to the DAO refused to leave without their Vietnamese friends and dependents, who included common-law wives and children. It was illegal for the DAO to move <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> American soil, and this initially slowed down the rate of departure, but eventually the DAO began illegally flying undocumented Vietnamese to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines.|$|E
500|$|Uroš Predić (1857–1953) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} 19th- and 20th-century Serbian realists. A native of Orlovat, a village in the Banat region of Austria-Hungary, Predić drew scenes of life in the village throughout his career. One of the more frequent sights during his stays there was of intoxicated young men returning from the pub at dawn and waking up the whole village. In painting the composition, Predić was not only attempting to realistically depict contemporary village life but also to convey a message. [...] "I observed this every day", he explained. [...] "I said to myself there must be some way of telling <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> what an unhappy level they have descended and have a moral impact on them, capturing all the bad habits of my compatriots." [...] Predić had expressed disapproval of the villagers' behavior in an earlier work, Clients in Front of a Lawyer's Door (1886).|$|E
500|$|Sound editor Bruce Tanis {{explained}} {{the production of}} sound {{that went into the}} episode in an interview with Designing Sound: [...] "In 'Fracture', the villain has created a serum which several characters inject because of a type of post-hypnotic suggestion. He has invented a frequency generator which causes <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> crystallize and then explode. In one of the best scenes all season, Walter and Astrid are in the lab and, using a watermelon for their experiments, are able to determine the exact frequency that the villain’s generator operates on. It was something like 68.7 megacycles (I don’t recall exactly), so I used the signal generator plugin and created some tones that started out as 68.7 megacycles. They were simply low-frequency tones on their own so I processed them so that they warbled and chorused and were a bit more mysterious than the straight tone. It ended up being pretty subtle for television, but when Walter identifies the tone as a certain frequency, that’s what’s actually playing." ...|$|E

500|$|The BBC Top Gear {{studio is}} part of the Home Space when viewing a car. The studio has the {{original}} TV series cars on plinths, such as the destroyed Toyota Hilux and Clarkson's Fiat Coupé police car as seen in Series 11, Episode 1, and all of the original Top Gear logos, Stig posters, and lighting arrangements, that reflect off the paintwork of the car the player is viewing, similar to how they would on the real Top Gear show. A live action commercial was produced and contained a voice over track by Jeremy Clarkson. The commercial is set in a busy city in which a man merely wants to drive fast. As the man speeds through the city streets with police in pursuit Clarkson speaks of lovers of speed as an endangered species. He notes that places for <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> truly enjoy their cars are being taken away, then pitches the video game. The commercial was well received by the media. Jalopnik's Ray Wert called the advert [...] "epic". The driving was performed by professional stunt driver Martin Ivanov.|$|E

[...] Rhimes also explains why {{it took so long}} to produce this episode: [...] The script was written by Rhimes in November 2010.

Sara Ramirez used the opportunity to launch her career as a singer-songwriter; an alternate version of [...] "The Story" [...] is included on her debut EP, released four days prior to the episode's premiere. The episode served to improve the relationship between Mark and Arizona. Capshaw assessed that, [...] "The traumatic circumstance leads to them having a greater understanding of each other and then appreciation, and then need for each other and desire to be in each other’s lives. They come to care, I think, for one another." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 28, 2008, Beghe posted online {{a letter}} to Church leader David Miscavige, {{requesting}} the confidential confessional files that Scientology compiles during Auditing sessions. In a message posted to the Operation Clambake website, Beghe wrote: [...] "As the Church of Scientology carefully monitors all anti-scientology websites, I am posting the letter here, on xenu.net, to assure that it be received by the C of S." [...] He had previously contacted the President's Office at The Church of Scientology Celebrity Centre International who [...] "refused to directly respond" [...] to his request, and {{a letter to}} David Miscavige sent through the Church communication system was also refused. Beghe told The Village Voice that these confidential files are also kept on actor Tom Cruise {{as well as other}} celebrity Scientologists. [...] "More people have left Scientology than are currently in it. And yet they maintain these files about what people have said to them in private sessions. Why would you want <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> hold onto this stuff?" [...] said Beghe to The Village Voice. Beghe believes that Scientology's practice of disconnection is still in place, and in an interview with Tony Ortega of The Village Voice cited his four-year-old son being kicked out of a Scientology school as an example of disconnection.|$|E
