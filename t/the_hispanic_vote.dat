25|$|The Hispanic population, {{particularly}} the large Mexican American {{population in the}} Southwest and the large Puerto Rican and Dominican populations in the Northeast, have been strong supporters of the Democratic Party. In the 1996 presidential election, Democratic President Bill Clinton received 72% of <b>the</b> <b>Hispanic</b> <b>vote.</b> In following years, however, the Republican Party gained increasing support from the Hispanic community, especially among Hispanic Protestants and Pentecostals. With his much more liberal views on immigration, President Bush was the first Republican president to gain 40% of <b>the</b> <b>Hispanic</b> <b>vote</b> (he did so in the 2004 presidential election). Yet the Republican Party's support among Hispanics eroded in the 2006 midterm elections, dropping from 44% to 30%, with the Democrats gaining in <b>the</b> <b>Hispanic</b> <b>vote</b> from 55% in 2004 to 69% in 2006. Democrats increased their share of <b>the</b> <b>Hispanic</b> <b>vote</b> in the 2008 presidential election, with Barack Obama receiving 67%. According to exit polls by Edison Research, Obama increased his support again in 2012, winning 71% of Hispanic voters.|$|E

Cruz won with 4.5 million votes (56.4%) to Sadler's 3.2 million (40.6%). Two minor candidates garnered the remaining 3% of the vote. According to a poll by Cruz's pollster Wilson Perkins Allen Opinion Research, Cruz received 40% of <b>the</b> <b>Hispanic</b> <b>vote,</b> vs. 60% for Sadler, outperforming Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney with <b>the</b> <b>Hispanic</b> <b>vote</b> in Texas.|$|E

50|$|Arizona was McCain's {{home state}} and gave its 10 electoral votes to its {{favorite}} son. However, he won just under 54 {{percent of the}} vote. By comparison, he'd been reelected in 2004 with 77 percent of the vote, {{one of the largest}} margins of victory for a statewide race in Arizona history. This led to speculation that the race would have been far closer without McCain on the ballot. One major factor is <b>the</b> growing <b>Hispanic</b> <b>vote</b> in <b>the</b> state, a voting bloc that tends to favor the Democrats, although both George W. Bush and John McCain held moderate positions on illegal immigration.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, <b>the</b> Latino or <b>Hispanic</b> <b>vote</b> is {{typically}} associated with immigration issues such as immigration reform, immigration enforcement and amnesty for undocumented immigrants, usually with images of Mexican illegal immigrants crossing the border or being arrested by the border patrol, {{despite the fact that}} in many cases immigration could be an issue no more important than unemployment or the economy for many Latino American citizens.|$|R
25|$|The Nevada Caucus {{took place}} on January 19. Obama {{received}} the endorsement of two very important unions in the state: the Culinary Workers Union (whose 60,000 members staff the casinos and resorts of Las Vegas and elsewhere) and the Nevada chapter of the SEIU.

25|$|In the end, Giuliani won 59% of {{the vote}} to Messinger's 41%, {{and became the first}} {{registered}} Republican to win a second term as mayor while on the Republican line since Fiorello H. La Guardia in 1941. Voter turnout was the lowest in 12 years, with 38% of registered voters casting ballots. The margin of victory included gains in his share of the African American vote (20% compared to 1993's 5%) and <b>the</b> <b>Hispanic</b> <b>vote</b> (43% from 37%) while maintaining his base of white ethnic, Catholic and Jewish voters from 1993.|$|E
5000|$|The {{last time}} Texas {{voted for a}} Democratic {{candidate}} was the 1976 Presidential election when Jimmy Carter won 51.14% of <b>the</b> popular <b>vote.</b> <b>Hispanic</b> participation can create a very interesting and unpredictable outcome, especially on the Democratic statewide tickets since they lean heavily Democratic.

25|$|Georgia was {{the last}} state to fall, with Sonny Perdue taking the {{governorship}} in 2002. Republicans aided the process with redistricting that protected <b>the</b> African-American and <b>Hispanic</b> <b>vote</b> (as required by the Civil Rights laws), but split up the remaining white Democrats so that Republicans mostly would win. In 2006, the Supreme Court endorsed {{nearly all of the}} gerrymandering engineered by Tom DeLay that swung the Texas Congressional delegation to the GOP in 2004. DeLay himself was acquitted on appeal in 2013 of illegally funding the state GOP.|$|R
50|$|In {{the general}} election, 67% of <b>Hispanics</b> and Latinos <b>voted</b> for Obama and 31% voted for McCain, with a {{relatively}} stronger turnout than in previous elections in states such as Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, and Virginia, helping Obama carry those formerly Republican states. Obama won 70% of non-Cuban Hispanics and 35% of the traditionally Republican Cuban Americans who have a strong presence in Florida. The changing state demographics, in which <b>the</b> non-Cuban <b>Hispanic</b> community is increasing in number, also contributed to his carrying Florida's Latinos with 57% of <b>the</b> <b>vote.</b> <b>Hispanics</b> and Latinos also offset Republican gains in traditional red states; for example, Obama carried 63% of Texas Latinos, when the overall vote of the state was for McCain by 55%.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>Hispanic</b> <b>voting</b> {{behavior in}} <b>the</b> 2004 Presidential election. Our research makes {{a significant contribution}} to <b>the</b> literature on <b>Hispanic</b> politics, as this is the first study to apply theories of issue and economic voting to a nationwide sample of Hispanic voters. We demonstrate that, similar to Anglos, issues and ideology were highly influential in <b>the</b> <b>vote</b> choice of <b>Hispanics</b> in <b>the</b> 2004 election. However, using the best available data on <b>Hispanic</b> <b>voting</b> behavior for this election, a statewide aggregation of the National Election Pool (NEP), we demonstrate that in this election Hispanic voters placed more emphasis on moral values issues and national security than on traditional domestic issues such as the economy and education. This accounted for Republican gains beyond the overall increase in Bush’s vote share from 2000 to 2004. We also show that moral values and national security had roughly equal importance in Bush’s victory.

From July through December 1998, Bush's reelection {{committee}} paid Rove & Co. nearly $2.5 million, and also paid the Rove-owned Praxis List Company $267,000 {{for use of}} mailing lists. Rove says his work for the Bush campaign included direct mail, voter contact, phone banks, computer services, and travel expenses. Of the $2.5 million, Rove said, [...] "bout 30 percent of that is postage". In all, Bush (primarily through Rove's efforts) raised $17.7 million, with $3.4 million unspent as of March 1999.

He remained in the Senate until 1961 and set the filibuster record in the chamber at the time by speaking for thirty-six straight hours against a set of bills on segregation. Most of the bills were abandoned (eight out of ten). He ran for governor in 1958 and finished second in the Democratic primary (the real contest for governor in what was then a solidly Democratic state) to Price Daniel. In May 1961, González ran in the special election for the Senate seat that Lyndon B.
