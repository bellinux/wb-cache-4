5|$|On August 31, Huntsman made a {{major policy}} announcement, calling for, amongst other things such as more {{aggressive}} action on completing free trade agreements, a tax policy modeled on the Simpson-Bowles plan, specifically: elimination of <b>the</b> <b>Alternative</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Tax,</b> elimination of taxes on capital gains and dividends, elimination of all deductions and credits, in favor of significantly lower general rates, with brackets of 8, 14 and 23 percent, and lowering the general corporate rate from 35 to 25%.|$|E
5|$|Ryan {{supports}} {{eliminating the}} capital gains tax, the corporate income tax, the estate tax, and <b>the</b> <b>Alternative</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Tax.</b> In 1999, Ryan supported the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed some financial regulation of banks from the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933. During the economic recovery from the Great Recession of the late 2000s, Ryan supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which authorized the Treasury to purchase toxic assets from banks and other financial institutions, and the auto industry bailout; Ryan opposed the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which expanded consumer protections regarding credit card plans, and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which strengthened financial regulation.|$|E
5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from dividends and capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and <b>the</b> <b>Alternative</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Tax.</b> He promised {{that the loss of}} government revenue from these tax cuts would be offset by closing loopholes and placing limits on tax deductions and credits available to taxpayers with the highest incomes, but said that that aspect of the plan could not yet be evaluated because details would have to be worked out with Congress.|$|E

The capital gains rate was capped at 28%. The value of high income itemized deductions was limited: reduced by 3% times {{the extent to which}} AGI exceeds $100,000.

25|$|The Senate {{then began}} {{consideration}} of the bill starting with the $275 billion tax provisions in the week of February 2, 2009.

25|$|The current {{federal income}} tax law allows {{individuals}} to deduct the home mortgage interest costs from taxable income (unless the taxpayer is subject to <b>the</b> <b>Alternative</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Tax).</b> Home mortgage interest {{is one of the}} few personal expenditures that is treated in this manner. Someone paying a 25% income tax rate would receive $250 back from the government for $1,000 expended in home mortgage interest. While there is no deduction for payroll taxes and most do not itemize the income tax deduction for full benefit, this preferential treatment of mortgage interest encourages households to spend relatively more of their income on housing than would otherwise be the case.|$|E
25|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and {{its impact}} on <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> (AMT) reduced nominal rates on the wealthy and {{eliminated}} tax deductions, while raising tax rates on lower-income individuals. The across the board tax system reduced marginal rates and further reduced bracket creep from inflation. The highest income earners (with incomes exceeding $1,000,000) received a tax break, restoring a flatter tax system. In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report characterized the effective rise in the AMT for individuals as a problem with the tax code. Through 2007, the revised AMT had brought in more tax revenue than the former tax code, which has made it difficult for Congress to reform.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>Alternative</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Tax</b> targeted {{tax shelters}} {{used by a}} few wealthy households. However, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 greatly expanded the AMT to aim at {{a different set of}} deductions that most Americans receive. Things like the personal exemption, state and local taxes, the standard deduction, private activity bond interest, certain expenses like union dues and even some medical costs for the seriously ill could now trigger the AMT. In 2007, the New York Times reported, [...] "A law for untaxed rich investors was refocused on families who own their homes in high tax states." ...|$|R

In summary, McCain would make the Bush tax cuts permanent instead of letting them expire, he would eliminate <b>the</b> <b>Alternative</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Tax</b> in order to assist the middle-class, he would double the personal exemption for dependents, reduce the corporate tax rate, and offer a new research and development tax credit. At the same time, he pledges to eliminate pork-barrel spending, freeze nondefense discretionary spending {{for a year or}} more, and reduce Medicare growth. He is also opposed to extravagant salaries and severance deals of corporate CEOs. In 2013, the National Journal gave McCain an economic rating of 61% conservative and 38% liberal.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Obama's 2012 re-election, Congressional Republicans and Obama again faced {{off over}} the final fate of the Bush tax cuts. Republicans sought to make all tax cuts permanent, while Obama sought to extend the tax cuts only for those making under $250,000. Obama and Congressional Republicans came to an {{agreement}} on the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which made permanent the tax cuts for individuals making less than $400,000 a year (or less than $450,000 for couples). For earnings greater than that amount, the income tax increased from 35% to 39.6%, which was the top rate before {{the passage of the}} Bush tax cuts. The deal also permanently indexed <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> for inflation, limited deductions for individuals making more than $250,000 ($300,000 for couples), permanently set the estate tax exemption at $5.12 million (indexed to inflation), and increased the top estate tax rate from 35% to 40%. Though many Republicans did not like the deal, the bill passed the Republican House in large part {{due to the fact that}} the failure to pass any bill would have resulted in the total expiration of the Bush tax cuts.|$|E

40|$|PROFESSORS Chorvat and Knoll present us with {{a strong}} {{argument}} for repealing <b>the</b> corporate <b>alternative</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> (AMT). In 2001, repeal was recommended by the Joint Committee on Taxation {{as part of their}} simplification study, endorsed by the ABA/AICPA/TEI tax simplification project, and included in a bill passed by the House of Representatives. Since this issue is likely to arise again, it seems worthwhile to review the arguments raised by Chorvat and Knoll. Upon review, none of these arguments seem particularly persuasive; at best, they make a case for reforming the corporate AMT, not for repealing it. On the other hand, Chorvat and Knoll understate the case for retaining the corporate AMT in some form...|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{proposed}} {{changes to the}} United States tax code have been announced by the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. The proposal would reduce the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent as well as repealing <b>the</b> corporate <b>alternative</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>tax</b> (“AMT”). Depreciation rules would be replaced with expensing new investment in equipment, structures, and intellectual property.

In addition, the deductibility of net interest expense would be eliminated. Additionally, corporate tax would be [...] "border adjusted", which would mean that exports would be exempt from the tax and imports subject to it.|$|R
25|$|During his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney said {{he would}} seek income tax law reforms that he said would help lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth.

Non-partisan analyses of Romney’s tax plan estimated that it could have added more than $3 trillion to the federal deficit, and would have favored the highest-earning Americans, possibly raising annual taxes on middle-class earners by as much as $2,000. Romney and supporters of his tax plan said that such analyses were unreliable because they were based on assumptions about specific measures that were not detailed in the plan and because they had not adequately accounted for the positive effects on economic growth that Romney said his plan would generate. And that lower tax rates would lower rates of Tax evasion.|$|E
500|$|According to Congressional Quarterly's Politics in America, one of Neal's long-standing {{legislative}} priorities is {{to simplify}} the tax code. Neal has long advocated repealing <b>the</b> <b>Alternative</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Tax</b> (AMT), believing its effects have reached unreasonably low income brackets. He led an unsuccessful movement to reform the AMT in 2007. He successfully pushed in 1998 to exempt a child tax credit from being affected by the AMT, and in 2001 Congress made the exemption permanent at his urging. He voted against the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, saying that they would force millions onto the AMT. Another priority of Neal's is to eliminate tax [...] "loopholes" [...] that favor higher-income individuals. He was the lead proponent of a bill to require federal contractors to pay federal taxes for workers hired through offshore shell headquarters. The bill, H.R. 6081, passed both houses of Congress unanimously and {{was signed into law}} in May 2008.|$|E
500|$|The FairTax is a {{proposal}} to reform the federal tax code of the United States. [...] It would replace all federal income taxes (including <b>the</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>tax,</b> corporate income taxes, and capital gains taxes), payroll taxes (including Social Security and Medicare taxes), gift taxes, and estate taxes with a single broad national consumption tax on retail sales. The Fair Tax Act (/) would apply a tax, once, {{at the point of}} purchase on all new goods and services for personal consumption. The proposal also calls for a monthly payment to all family households of lawful U.S. residents as an advance rebate, or [...] "prebate", of tax on purchases up to the poverty level. [...] First introduced into the United States Congress in 1999, a number of congressional committees have heard testimony on the bill; however, it has not moved from committee and has yet to have any effect on the tax system. [...] In recent years, a tax reform movement has formed behind the FairTax proposal. [...] Attention increased after talk radio personality Neal Boortz and Georgia Congressman John Linder published The FairTax Book in 2005 and additional visibility was gained in the 2008 presidential campaign.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the above studies, William G. Gale of the Brookings Institution published a study in Tax Notes that estimated a rate of 28.2% (39.3% tax-exclusive) for 2007 assuming full taxpayer compliance and an average rate of 31% (44% tax-exclusive) from 2006 to 2015 (assumes that the Bush tax cuts expire on schedule and accounts for the replacement of an additional $3 trillion collected through <b>the</b> <b>Alternative</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Tax).</b> The study also concluded that if the tax base were eroded by 10% due to tax evasion, tax avoidance, and/or legislative adjustments, the average rate would be 34% (53% tax-exclusive) for the 10-year period. [...] A dynamic analysis in 2008 by the Baker Institute For Public Policy concluded that a 28% (38.9% tax-exclusive) rate would be revenue neutral for 2006. The President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform performed a 2006 analysis to replace the individual and corporate income tax with a retail sales tax and estimated the rate to be 25% (34% tax-exclusive) assuming 15% tax evasion, and 33% (49% tax-exclusive) with 30% tax evasion. The rate {{would need to be}} substantially higher to replace the additional taxes replaced by the FairTax (payroll, estate, and gift taxes). Several economists criticized the President's Advisory Panel's study as having allegedly altered the terms of the FairTax, using unsound methodology, and/or failing to fully explain their calculations.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> federal <b>Alternative</b> <b>Minimum</b> <b>Tax</b> has {{potentially}} salutary – and heretofore unrecognized – {{effects that}} counteract pathologies of state budgets over the business cycle. A taxpayer’s AMT liability increases with income, and acts to eliminate federal tax subsidies for state revenue-raising. Thus, as a state’s income grows and the AMT hits more state residents, state spending becomes more expensive in flush times {{as the federal}} tax subsidy {{for state and local}} taxes is reduced. Conversely, when state fiscal health deteriorates, the federal tax subsidy grows as fewer state residents fall under the AMT, boosting taxpayer support for state spending. This stabilizing mechanism has the potential to overcome problems state politicians face committing to saving during boom times and spending during bust times.
