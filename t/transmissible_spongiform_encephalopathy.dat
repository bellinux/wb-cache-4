25|$|Bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE), {{commonly known as}} mad cow disease, is a <b>transmissible</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> and fatal neurodegenerative disease in cattle that may be passed to humans who have eaten infected flesh. BSE causes a spongiform degeneration {{of the brain and}} spinal cord. BSE has a long incubation period, of 2.5 to 5 years, usually affecting adult cattle at a peak age onset of four to five years. BSE is caused by a misfolded protein—a prion. In the United Kingdom, more than 180,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million slaughtered during the eradication program. In France, the country worst affected overall, over 300,000 cases were identified, although most were not recorded at the time.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), {{with support}} from the TSE (<b>transmissible</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy)</b> Advisory Committee, began {{monitoring}} the potential risk of transmitting animal diseases, especially bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease. An FDA study from that year stated: [...] "...steps such as heat, alkaline treatment, and filtration could be effective in reducing the level of contaminating TSE agents; however, scientific evidence is insufficient at this time to demonstrate that these treatments would effectively remove the BSE infectious agent if present in the source material." [...] On March 18, 2016 the FDA finalized three previously-issued interim final rules designed to further reduce the potential risk of BSE in human food. The final rule clarified that [...] "gelatin is not considered a prohibited cattle material if it is manufactured using the customary industry processes specified." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prions are not {{destroyed}} even if {{the beef}} or material containing them is cooked or heat-treated. Prion proteins carry the disease between individuals and cause deterioration of the brain. <b>Transmissible</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathy</b> (TSE)s like BSE can arise in animals that carry an allele which causes previously normal protein molecules to contort by themselves from an alpha helical arrangement to a beta pleated sheet, which is the disease-causing shape for the particular protein. Transmission can occur when healthy animals {{come in contact with}} tainted tissues from others with the disease. In the brain, these proteins cause native cellular prion protein to deform into the infectious state, which then goes on to deform further prion protein in an exponential cascade. This results in protein aggregates, which then form dense plaque fibers leading to the microscopic appearance of [...] "holes" [...] in the brain, degeneration of physical and mental abilities, and ultimately death.|$|E

40|$|The <b>transmissible</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> are a {{heterogeneous}} group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders occurring in humans, mink, cats, and ruminant herbivores. The occurrence of novel <b>transmissible</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> in cattle in the United Kingdom and Europe and in mule deer and elk {{in parts of}} the United States has emphasized the need for reliable diagnostic tests with standardized reagents. Postmortem diagnosis is performed by histologic examination of brain sections from affected animals. The histopathological criteria for <b>transmissible</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies</b> include gliosis, astrocytosis, neuronal degeneration, and spongiform change. These lesions vary in intensity and anatomic location depending on the host species and genetics, stage of disease, and infectious agent source. Diagnosis by histopathology alone may be ambiguous in hosts with early cases of disease and impossible if the tissue is autolyzed. Deposition of the prion protein (an abnormal isoform of a native cellular sialoglycoprotein) in the central nervous system is a reliable marker for infection, and immunohistochemical detection of this marker is a useful adjunct to histopathology. In the present paper we describe monoclonal antibody (MAb) F 89 / 160. 1. 5, which reacts with prion protein in tissues from sheep, cattle, mule deer, and elk with naturally occurring <b>transmissible</b> <b>spongiform</b> <b>encephalopathies.</b> This MAb recognizes a conserved epitope on the prion protein in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections after hydrated autoclaving.
