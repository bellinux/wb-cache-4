5|$|By Sept. 2, 1871, Polaris {{had reached}} her furthest north of 82°29'N. Tension flared {{again as the}} three leading {{officers}} could not agree on whether to proceed further or not. Hall and Tyson wanted to press north, to cut down the distance {{they would have to}} travel to the Pole by dogsled. Budington did not want to further risk the ship, and walked out on the discussion. In <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>they</b> sailed into Thank God Harbor (now called Hall Bay) on Sept. 10, 1871, and anchored for the winter on the shore of northern Greenland.|$|E
5|$|In Resident Evil 5, {{the primary}} player {{controls}} Redfield, whom Alomar follows throughout {{the game as}} an ally controlled by artificial intelligence (AI). In the game's co-operative gameplay mode, a second player will control Alomar. When the game has been completed once, there is an option to make Alomar the primary character. During {{the events of the}} game, Alomar and Redfield stop the Tricell corporation, who were continuing Umbrella's work, from infecting the world with a new BOW. In <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>they</b> kill the series' villain Albert Wesker.|$|E

50|$|Cervantes {{announces that}} the story is {{finished}} {{at least as far}} as he has written it, but the prisoners are dissatisfied with <b>the</b> <b>ending.</b> <b>They</b> prepare to burn his manuscript when he asks for the chance to present one last scene.|$|R
5|$|The Japanese {{units in}} the area also defended strongly, but they too were short on {{supplies}} and in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>they</b> were forced to withdraw further north. Wareo subsequently fell to the Allies on 8 December, who then established a line east from Wareo to Gusika on the coast. From there they carried out further advances north later in the month and into early January 1944.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{localization}} of {{the game}} was done by Aksys Games; Chunsoft was introduced to them by Spike when looking {{for a company that}} could publish the game in North America. When Aksys evaluated the game, many at the company did not believe in it and turned it down; as {{many of the people who}} evaluate games at Aksys do not speak Japanese, it was difficult for them to determine whether a game was good or not. In <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>they</b> decided to localize it, which was considered a big risk for the company.|$|E
5|$|The episode centres on Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) working {{her first}} case with Torchwood Three in Cardiff. A purple alien gas is {{loose in the}} city and takes Carys Fletcher (Sara Gregory) host; the gas kills its victims by orgasm, leaving behind a pile of dust. Over the course of the episode, the team hunt for Carys before the gas kills her.

50|$|The linebackers' main role is run support; they line up {{anywhere}} between <b>the</b> defensive <b>ends.</b> <b>They</b> can be stacked on the tackles or offset either inside or outside, {{depending on the}} tackles' alignment. Pass coverage responsibilities are for running backs {{coming out of the}} backfield, running backs in the slot formation, or, in some situations, tight <b>ends.</b> <b>The</b> defensive backs' first concern is to watch for the pass; they are responsible for <b>the</b> <b>ends.</b> <b>They</b> may cover a running back in the slot back position, leaving <b>the</b> tight <b>end</b> for <b>the</b> linebacker. In run plays, they act as a second set of linebackers.|$|R
5|$|Weaver and Chambers {{left the}} {{convention}} with {{high hopes for}} the third party's cause, but in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>they</b> were disappointed. The election was a close contest between the Republican, James A. Garfield, and the Democrat, Winfield Scott Hancock, with Garfield being the narrow victor. The Greenback ticket placed a distant third, netting just over three {{percent of the popular}} vote.|$|E
5|$|Adnan led a 42-strong platoon {{from the}} Malay Regiment in the defence of Singapore against the invading Japanese. The {{soldiers}} fought at the Battle of Pasir Panjang, at Pasir Panjang Ridge in the Bukit Chandu (Opium Hill) area on 12–14 February 1942. Although heavily outnumbered, Adnan refused to surrender and urged {{his men to}} fight on until <b>the</b> <b>end.</b> <b>They</b> held off the Japanese troops for two days amid heavy enemy shelling from artillery guns and tanks and chronic shortages of food, medical supplies and ammunition (on {{the last day of}} the battle, Adnan and his men were only left with a few hand grenades and had to fight off the Japanese soldiers with their bayonets and through brutal hand-to-hand combat. Adnan was shot but carried on fighting.|$|E
5|$|On D-Day, the 1st Special Service Brigade was {{tasked with}} linking {{up with the}} 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword and {{securing}} the high ground near La Plein. No. 3 Commando landed at La Breche, west of Ouistreham at 09:05 coming ashore in the second wave. They were engaged before they hit the beach, {{and three of the}} landing craft that the Commandos were travelling in were hit by high-velocity shells. Casualties were high, with No. 6 Troop suffering at least 20 wounded, but in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>they</b> were lower than had been expected.|$|E

5|$|They {{announced}} their forthcoming {{project in the}} Spanish media, stating that they were choosing ten songs for the album {{and that it would}} be released in the fall of 2011 or early in 2012. In <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>they</b> created several more songs than they had planned. When asked if the album might be released in March 2012, marking the 17th anniversary of Selena's death, Abraham said that it was a possibility. Many media outlets called it a remix album. Abraham told the press that it would be released in five volumes, with ten tracks on each.|$|E
5|$|After filming commenced, Paramount Pictures {{brought in}} two African-American {{consultants}} {{to review and}} approve the depiction of the black characters: Willis Edwards, {{vice president of the}} local NAACP chapter, and David L. Crippens, the vice president and stage manager of the local PBS affiliate. In <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>they</b> walked away with different views of the film. Crippens did not find the film to have any racist connotations, while Edwards found it inflammatory and felt it should not have been made, particularly not during that year, when a series of murders of black children was occurring in Atlanta. The two men provided a write-up of their views for the studio executives, which were passed to Davison along with warnings that the studio feared a film boycott. But Fuller was neither told of these discussions, nor given the notes, until two weeks before filming was slated to conclude. Known for being a staunch integrationist and for his regularly giving black actors non-stereotypical roles, Fuller was furious, finding the studio's actions insulting. He reportedly had both representatives banned from the set afterwards, though he did integrate some of the suggested changes into the film.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{revealed}} to be a ghost story inspired by nineteenth-century French fantasy literature, the film uses the conventions of the genre —that people who die in emotional distress or with an unfinished task may become ghosts— and openly details these conventions. Marie and Adrienne's 'lives' as revenants are reduced to a single purpose, each with only {{the memory of her}} suicide and her last emotions remaining. Julien, like the audience, is eventually confronted with Marie's nightmare of repetition. Elements of the horror genre are used, not to scare but to explore memory and loss. To stay with Marie, Julien first has to forget about her, and at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>they</b> have the promise of a new beginning. Marie becomes a living person again rather than an object of fantasy. Marie's tears and blood are a miracle overcoming her death, and may reflect a fantasy of turning back the menopause. The credits are accompanied by an upbeat jazz song performed by Blossom Dearie, Our Day Will Come, that represents love as a pledge, the only music used in the film.|$|E

[...] Human 'Mission control' Following the team's first mission rescuing kidnapped {{children}} from aspirational skypirates, he recruited {{them as a}} band of trouble shooters and emissaries for Gastonia.

5|$|The game {{begins as}} Professor E. Gadd completes his newest {{invention}} {{of a time}} machine powered by a gem called the Cobalt Star, which is presented at Peach's Castle. Peach enters the time machine into the past, but fails to return, only leaving {{a member of an}} alien species known only as the Shroobs within the damaged time machine. The Mushroom Kingdom of the past had actually been invaded by the Shroobs, with Peach being kidnapped and held hostage at her castle. After defeating the monster, a time hole opens, leaving a passageway into the past. While searching for Peach, Mario and Luigi locate their younger selves, and agree to locate the crystal shards, which are remnants of the Cobalt Star which had been shattered during Peach's journey. Unwittingly, the brothers collect all of the shards, while being pestered by Baby Bowser (Bowser in the past) who wants the Cobalt Star. At <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>they</b> restore the Cobalt Star only to unleash the Elder Princess Shroob, who serves as the game's final boss character. The story ends when she is defeated, Peach is rescued, and the past returns to normal.|$|E
5|$|When {{they face}} Orphan, despite the party's pleas for Fang to not {{transform}} into Ragnarok, Fang eventually transforms into an incomplete version and fights the fal'Cie alone, but gets tortured {{as a result}} of her failure, only to be saved by Lightning's group. After Orphan's destruction, Fang and Vanille complete their Focus by becoming Ragnarok to save Cocoon from crashing into Gran Pulse. In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Fang and Vanille appear to help Serah escape from the endless dream in the Void Beyond that Caius placed her in, and at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>they</b> are rescued from Cocoon's pillar when it finally collapse. By the events of Lightning Returns, after awakening and seeing Vanille being used by the Order, Fang has taken up residence in the Dead Dunes and becomes the leader of a bandit group bent on thwarting the Order from obtaining a relic within the desert. She attempts to destroy the relic so Vanille can be saved from being killed by the ritual. Fang appears on the final day, helping Lightning dissuade Vanille from going through with the ritual and helps her guide the souls of the dead to the new world.|$|E
5|$|Benfica {{played the}} second {{leg of the}} UEFA Cup third round on 3 March. At the Lerkendal Stadion, Rosenborg scored two goals inside the first 15 minutes, but Benfica regained their {{aggregate}} lead with a goal on the 19th minute. Despite playing with a man less in the second half, Moreira was not beaten again and Benfica went through to the next round on away goals. On the 7th, the team visited Gil Vicente's home stadium. Benfica scored first with Geovanni, but squandered two chances to make it 2–0. Instead Gil Vicente were able to equalize. Camacho substituted in Manuel Fernandes and the 17-year-old scored the winning-goal for Benfica. Camacho praised the players for maintaining their commitment after an exhausting European game. On the following Thursday, Benfica hosted Inter Milan in the UEFA Cup. The team had multiple chances against Toldo but could not beat him, with the match ending 0–0. On 14 March, Benfica played host to Marítimo, beating them 1–0 with a goal by Simão in the 81st minute. On the 17th, Benfica hosted Belenenses for the Portuguese Cup semi-final. With three goals scored in the first 36 minutes, Benfica managed the lead until <b>the</b> <b>end.</b> <b>They</b> qualified for their first final since 1997. On 21 March, Benfica visited the new Municipal de Aveiro to face the local team, Beira-Mar. With the team resting players for the game with Inter, Camacho brought in Nuno Gomes and the striker scored the winning goal with 15 minutes left to play. The win reduced the gap to Sporting to just 4 points. Four days later, Benfica and Inter Milan had an entertaining seven-goal thriller in the second leg of the UEFA Cup. At half-time, the teams were level, but in the 10 minutes between the 60th and 70th minute, Inter scored three to Benfica's one, opening a two-goal cushion. Benfica later reduced the lead to 4–3, but this was insufficient to prevent an elimination. Benfica closed March on the 28th. Two early goals allowed the team to cruise past Alverca, bringing their win tally to five wins in eight games.|$|E
