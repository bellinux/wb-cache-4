5|$|A later popular Polish legend related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the Polish {{coronation}} weapon, the Szczerbiec sword, is {{the tale}} of the Golden Gate of Kiev, upon which the Szczerbiec was supposedly notched when Bolesław's entered the city. This legend has no historical basis, however, and the gate was only built approximately 20years later, while the sword itself was not forged until 200years later. It is of course possible, however unlikely, that Bolesław notched another gate with another sword, thus giving rise to the legend.|$|E

50|$|At that time, {{after the}} great {{disturbance}} {{at the end of}} Sui, much of old book collections had been lost. Linghu advocated, and Emperor Gaozu agreed, to seek out books and purchase them and, once they were bought, to have them copied as well. After several years, the imperial collections were more comprehensive. Linghu also pointed out that while <b>the</b> Southern Dynasties' <b>histories</b> were largely written, little have been formally compiled of Northern Zhou and Sui Dynasty's histories—and that the deeds of the great people of those two dynasties, including those of Emperor Gaozu's ancestors, would be lost. Emperor Gaozu therefore issued an edict commissioning Xiao Yu, Wang Jingye (王敬業), and Yin Wenli (殷聞禮) <b>to</b> compile <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Northern Wei; Chen, Linghu, and Yu Jian (庾儉) <b>to</b> compile <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Northern Zhou; Feng Deyi and Yan Shigu <b>to</b> compile <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Sui; Cui Shanwei (崔善為), Kong Shao'an (孔紹安), and Xiao Deyan (蕭德言) <b>to</b> compile <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Liang Dynasty; Pei Ju, Zu Xiaosun (祖孝孫), and Wei Zheng <b>to</b> compile <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Southern Qi; and Dou Jin (竇璡), Ouyang Xun, and Yao Silian <b>to</b> compile <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Chen Dynasty. However, after the issuance of Emperor Gaozu's edict, not much actual historical compilation was carried out, and the projects stalled.|$|R

5|$|His 1815 Polish {{translation}} of Homer's Iliad {{met with a}} negative reception. In 1816–20 he published many of his writings in a 9-volume Works (Dzieła).
