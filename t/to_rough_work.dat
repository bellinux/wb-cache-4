6000|$|The surgeon {{looked at}} him gravely. [...] "I {{scarcely}} think you need worry, {{but if you have}} <b>to</b> do any <b>rough</b> <b>work</b> I would endeavour to avoid any lacerated bruises, and, as far as possible, keep your skin unbroken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A sure thing! Money is made {{by sitting}} tight in your office and hiring other fellows <b>to</b> do the <b>rough</b> <b>work.</b> They break up the rocks and cut the milling logs; you take the profit. It's business, first and last, for mine!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a kitchen-maid, who cooked this wretched mess," [...] Cecil answered, [...] "and another {{under her}} from the village, who seems half an idiot. There is no one else except Pawles, a man who comes in from the stables <b>to</b> do the <b>rough</b> <b>work</b> and pump the water up for the bath. We are {{practically}} alone in the house." ...|$|R
60|$|Child-bearing, hard work, and {{constant}} anxiety {{were beginning to}} tell on Mrs. Athelny; and sometimes her back ached in the evening so {{that she had to}} sit down and rest herself. Her ideal of happiness was to have a girl <b>to</b> do the <b>rough</b> <b>work</b> so that she need not herself get up before seven. Athelny waved his beautiful white hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{would never}} stand our going to Switzerland by ourselves," [...] I objected. [...] "You know what {{happened}} last time.

50|$|The reader learns at {{the closest}} levels that Sheppey’s wife, Mrs Miller, {{believes}} she {{will benefit from}} the assistance of a charwoman <b>to</b> do the <b>rough</b> <b>work</b> of washing etc. as she approaches her later years. Florrie, his daughter, is able and does quit her work in the city so that she can speed up the proposed marriage date to her somewhat precocious sweetheart Ernie.|$|R
60|$|Having {{risen to}} his feet, Corrie at once hopped towards Alice, after {{the fashion of}} those country wights who indulge in sack races, and, going {{down on his knees}} beside her, began {{diligently}} to gnaw the rope that bound her with his teeth. This was by no means an easy or a quick process. He gnawed and bit at it long before the tough rope gave way. At length Alice was freed, and she immediately set to work to undo the fastenings of the other two, but her delicate fingers were not well suited <b>to</b> such <b>rough</b> <b>work,</b> and a considerable time elapsed before the three were finally at large.|$|R
6000|$|... "By the saints, no! Gaston, I {{will not}} have it! You have said truly {{that it is an}} awesome thing <b>to</b> have such <b>rough</b> <b>work</b> upon one's soul. I am but a rude soldier, yet I have a mind. Mon Dieu! I reflect, I weigh, I balance. Shall I not meet this man again? Shall I not bear him in mind? Shall I not know him by his great paws and his red head? Ma foi, yes!" ...|$|R
60|$|As Stephen Boldero had foretold, Geoffrey did {{not find}} his work on shore oppressively hard. He did his best, and, {{as he and his}} {{companion}} always performed a far larger share of work than that done by any two of the Spaniards, they gained the goodwill of their overlooker, who, when a fortnight later the principal bey of the place sent down a request for two slaves <b>to</b> do some <b>rough</b> <b>work</b> in his garden, selected them for the work.|$|R
60|$|Well it {{was that}} Hare had {{received}} his initiation and had become inured <b>to</b> <b>rough,</b> incessant <b>work,</b> for now he came to know the real stuff of which these Mormons were made. No obstacle barred them. They penetrated the gullies to the last step; they rode weathered slopes that were difficult for deer to stick upon; they thrashed the bayonet-guarded manzanita copses; they climbed into labyrinthine fastnesses, penetrating to every nook where a steer could hide. Miles of sliding slope and marble-bottomed streambeds were ascended on foot, for cattle could climb where a horse could not. Climbing was arduous enough, yet the hardest and most perilous toil began when a wild steer was cornered. They roped the animals on moving slopes of weathered stone, and branded them {{on the edges of}} precipices.|$|R
60|$|Missionaries, however good, may {{not always}} be wise folk; the reader might even think the Rev. Thomas Bull to be no perfect {{embodiment}} of wisdom, sympathy or perhaps manners, but taking them as a class they are certainly heroic folks, who endure many things for small reward, as we reckon reward. In nothing perhaps do they show their heroism and faith more greatly than in their persistent habit of conveying women and young children into the most impossible places of the earth, there to suffer many things, not exclusive, occasionally, of martyrdom. At least the Protestant section of their calling does this; the Roman Catholics are wiser. In renouncing marriage these save themselves from many agonies, and having only their own lives and health at stake, are perhaps better fitted <b>to</b> face <b>rough</b> <b>work</b> in <b>rough</b> places.|$|R
6000|$|... "You do talk, Athelny," [...] she said, {{looking at}} him, not with anger but with scornful calm. [...] "You've had the {{pleasant}} {{part of the}} children, I've had the bearing of them, and the bearing with them. I don't say that I'm not fond of them, now they're there, but if I had my time over again I'd remain single. Why, if I'd remained single I might have a little shop by now, and four or five hundred pounds in the bank, and a girl <b>to</b> do the <b>rough</b> <b>work.</b> Oh, I wouldn't go over my life again, not for something." ...|$|R
60|$|She had {{obtained}} {{the address of}} a warehouse ready <b>to</b> give such <b>rough</b> <b>work</b> as the women {{could be expected to}} do; but as they were unaccustomed to work at home, and were at present much crowded from the loss of so many houses, and could besides be little depended on for working well enough without superintendence, her plan was to hire a room, collect the women, and divide the superintendence between the ladies; who should give out the work, see that it was properly done, keep order, and the like. She finished off in full order, by moving a resolution to this effect.|$|R
60|$|The {{sounds of}} keen {{activity}} stirred Festing's blood. He had {{a touch of}} constructive genius, but lack of specialized training had forced him {{into the ranks of}} the pioneers. Others must add the artistic finish and divide the prizes of ultimate victory; his part was <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> out the <b>work</b> and clear the way. But he was satisfied with this, and something in him thrilled as he heard in the crash of a blasting charge man's bold challenge to the wilderness. Kerr waited with a twinkle of understanding amusement while Festing looked about, and then took him up the hill.|$|R
6000|$|... "I seem to see--I seem to see--a sort of City of Women, Ponderevo. Yes.... A walled enclosure--good stone-mason's work--a city wall, high as {{the walls}} of Rome, going about a garden. Dozens of square miles of garden--trees--fountains--arbours--lakes. Lawns on which the women play, avenues in which they gossip, boats.... Women like that sort of thing. Any woman who's been to a good eventful girls' school lives on the memory of {{it for the rest}} of her life. It's one of the pathetic things about women--the superiority of school and college--to {{anything}} they get afterwards. And this city-garden of women will have beautiful places for music, places for beautiful dresses, places for beautiful work. Everything a woman can want. Nurseries. Kindergartens. Schools. And no man--except <b>to</b> do <b>rough</b> <b>work,</b> perhaps--ever comes in. The men live in a world where they can hunt and engineer, invent and mine and manufacture, sail ships, drink deep and practice the arts, and fight--" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{thus the}} {{perpetual}} question and contest must arise, who is <b>to</b> do this <b>rough</b> <b>work?</b> {{and how is}} the worker of it to be comforted, redeemed, and rewarded? {{and what kind of}} play should he have, and what rest, in this world, sometimes, {{as well as in the}} next? Well, my good working friends, these questions will take a little time to answer yet. They must be answered: all good men are occupied with them, and all honest thinkers. There's grand head work doing about them; but much must be discovered, and much attempted in vain, before anything decisive can be told you. Only note these few particulars, which are already sure.|$|R
6000|$|... 295. First {{cultivate}} {{all your}} personal powers, not competitively, but patiently and usefully. You {{have no business}} to read in the long vacation. Come here to make scholars of yourselves, {{and go to the}} mountains or the sea to make men of yourselves. Give at least a month in each year <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> sailor's <b>work</b> and sea fishing. Don't lounge and flirt on the beach, but make yourselves good seamen. Then, on the mountains, go and help the shepherd at his work, the wood-men at theirs, and learn to know the hills by night and day. If you are staying in level country, learn to plow, and whatever else you can that is useful. Then here in Oxford, read to the utmost of your power, and practice singing, fencing, wrestling, and riding. No rifle practice, and no racing--boat or other. Leave the river quiet for the naturalist, the angler, and the weary student like me.|$|R
50|$|The wide {{selection}} of brick styles and types generally available in industrialized nations allow much variety in {{the appearance of the}} final product. In buildings built during the 1950s-1970s, a high degree of uniformity of brick and accuracy in masonry was typical. In the period since then this style was thought to be too sterile, so attempts were made <b>to</b> emulate older, <b>rougher</b> <b>work.</b> Some brick surfaces are made to look particularly rustic by including burnt bricks, which have a darker color or an irregular shape. Others may use antique salvage bricks, or new bricks may be artificially aged by applying various surface treatments, such as tumbling. The attempts at rusticity of the late 20th century have been carried forward by masons specializing in a free, artistic style, where the courses are intentionally not straight, instead weaving to form more organic impressions.|$|R
60|$|Pittsburg and Alleghany--which {{latter is}} a town similar in its nature to Pittsburg, {{on the other side}} of the river of the same name--regard {{themselves}} as places apart; but they are in effect one and the same city. They live under the same blanket of soot, which is woven by the joint efforts of the two places. Their united population is 135,000, of which Alleghany owns about 50,000. The industry of the towns is of that sort which arises from a union of coal and iron in the vicinity. The Pennsylvanian coal fields are the most prolific in the Union; and Pittsburg is therefore great, exactly as Merthyr-Tydvil and Birmingham are great. But the foundery work at Pittsburg is more nearly allied <b>to</b> the heavy, <b>rough</b> <b>works</b> of the Welsh coal metropolis than to the finish and polish of Birmingham.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must get}} some men crafty in ship-building {{from one of}} the ports, sending down a body of our own serfs <b>to</b> do the <b>rough</b> <b>work.</b> We will go to Exeter first and there choose us the {{craftsman}} most skilled in building ships, and will take council with him as to the best form and size. She must be good to sail and yet able to row fast with a strong crew, and she must have room to house a goodly number of rowing and fighting men. You, Edmund, might, before we start, consult King Alfred. He must have seen at Rome and other ports on the Mediterranean the ships in use there, which are doubtless far in advance of our own. For we know from the Holy Bible that a thousand years ago St. Paul made long voyages in ships, and doubtless they have learned much since those days." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{champion}} now {{sent for}} his wife, whom he revered as a preeminently sensible and well-mannered woman. The newcomer {{could see in}} her only a ridiculous dancing-mistress; but he treated her with great deference, and thereby improved the favorable opinion which Skene had already formed of him. He related to her how, after running away from school, {{he had made his}} way to Liverpool, gone to the docks, and contrived to hide himself on board a ship bound for Australia. Also how he had suffered severely from hunger and thirst before he discovered himself; and how, notwithstanding his unpopular position as stowaway, he had been fairly treated as soon as he had shown {{that he was willing to}} work. And in proof that he was still willing, and had profited by his maritime experience, he offered to sweep the floor of the gymnasium then and there. This proposal convinced the Skenes, who had listened to his story like children listening to a fairy tale, that he was not too much of a gentleman <b>to</b> do <b>rough</b> <b>work,</b> and it was presently arranged that he should thenceforth board and lodge with them, have five shillings a week for pocket-money, and be man-of-all-work, servant, gymnasium- attendant, clerk, and apprentice to the ex-champion of England and the colonies.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of the hornfels is very characteristic. Very rarely {{do any of the}} minerals show crystalline form, but the small grains fit closely together like the fragments of a mosaic; they are usually of nearly equal dimensions. This has been called pflaster or pavement structure from the resemblance <b>to</b> <b>rough</b> pavement <b>work.</b> Each mineral may also enclose particles of the others; in the quartz, for example, small crystals of graphite, biotite, iron oxides, sillimanite or feldspar may appear in great numbers. Often the whole of the grains are rendered semi-opaque in this way. The minutest crystals may show traces of crystalline outlines; undoubtedly they are of new formation and have originated in situ. This leads us to believe that the whole rock has been recrystallized at a high temperature and in the solid state so that there was little freedom for the mineral molecules to build up well-individualized crystals. The regeneration of the rock has been sufficient to efface most of the original structures and to replace the former minerals more-or-less completely by new ones. But crystallization has been hampered by the solid condition of the mass and the new minerals are formless and have been unable to reject impurities, but have grown around them.|$|R
5000|$|Another key moment {{occurred}} in 1988, when, having long {{been working on}} Strat and Chatto by Jan Mark he found that after his [...] "early drawings in pencil/charcoal were rejected as too sophisticated," [...] and he felt that pencil-work often suffered from printing techniques he experimented in improving his pen and ink style. [...] "Submitting a rough pen and ink drawing to Pentagram", he found that they [...] "chose {{to use it as}} a finished piece" [...] as the cover to a book by Don Marquis entitled [...] "Archy and Mehitabel". In late 1989, [...] "he was invited by The Observer magazine to produce drawings for a topical weekly medical column, [...] "A Doctor Writes" [...] by Dr. John Collee," [...] first as one of a number of rotating artists, but soon as the solo, regular weekly artist. Describing his aversion <b>to</b> <b>roughing</b> out his <b>work,</b> Hughes notes the immediacy and challenge of producing full work as tending to allow an artist to produce better work: ...|$|R

60|$|So saying, {{he gently}} possessed {{himself of the}} handles of the litter, placed the sash over his shoulders, and started. It was indeed an immense relief <b>to</b> Nat. The <b>rough</b> <b>work</b> of the {{preceding}} day had caused {{the ends of the}} bone to grate, and had set up a great deal of inflammation. He had been suffering acutely since he started, in spite of the support of the bandage, and he had more than once thought that he would be obliged to ask Myra to take his place. He did not attempt to mount in the young Frenchman's saddle, for he thought that the motion of the horse would be worse for him than walking; he therefore took the reins in his hand, and walked at the horse's head behind the litter. The pain was less now that he was relieved of the load, but he still suffered a great deal, and he kept in the rear behind the others, while Myra chatted with Monsieur Laurent, learning from him what had happened in the town, and giving him a sketch of their adventures. As they passed the house of Madame Duchesne's sister, the invalid said that she would be taken in there, as she had heard from Monsieur Laurent that their own house was partially unroofed. Myra ran in to see her aunt, who came out with her at once.|$|R
