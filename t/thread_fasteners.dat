40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the loosening tendency of a <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener.</b> To achieve the objective, the <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> looseness model is constructed through the following procedures. Firstly, static and dynamic <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> models are derived to find the static and dynamic interior forces respectively. Secondly, for investigating the bolt loosening behaviour, the effects of thread lead angle, initial preload, vibration frequency, and the nature of material on the bolt looseness, the <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> looseness model is constructed by combining the above models with a Karnopp frictional model. The proposed approach not only analyses both the static and the dynamic behaviours of the bolt as well as the bolt loosening but also detects whether the bolt is within the elastic range or not. The approach can serve as a guide for designing a thread fastening procedure to avoid the failure of <b>threaded</b> <b>fasteners</b> due to vibration...|$|R

An externally <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> which {{is prevented from being}} turned during assembly and which can be tightened or released only by torquing a nut is a bolt.

40|$|Abstract- Fuel leakage in the {{pre-filter}} bowl of {{a diesel}} engine feed pump is the common problem in the field.

Though the <b>threaded</b> <b>fasteners</b> are easy for maintenance and low cost in the assembly of the components, they are not advisable due to its limitation of loosing the <b>threaded</b> <b>fastener</b> under the dynamic loading.
