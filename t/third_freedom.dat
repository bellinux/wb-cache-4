50|$|Race report: Pippa Mann led {{the field}} to the green flag, but was {{immediately}} overtaken by Wade Cunningham, with Charlie Kimball, series returnee Jeff Simmons and Martin Plowman all getting ahead of Mann {{by the end of}} the first lap. Mann's race ended at Turn 1 of lap three, being an innocent victim in an accident with Simmons, producing the race's only caution period. Championship leader Jean-Karl Vernay hit trouble early in the race, making a lengthy pit-stop on lap one, returning to the field several laps down. When the race returned to green on lap nine, Cunningham led from Kimball, Plowman, Dan Clarke and Philip Major. Kimball took the lead on lap ten before Cunningham repassed him on lap eleven. James Hinchcliffe progressed through the field, and ran as high as second place for the middle portion of the race, before Kimball reasserted himself in the position. He once again took the lead from Cunningham before the New Zealander took the lead for good on lap 34. Cunningham held his rivals off for the remaining laps, as he took his <b>third</b> <b>Freedom</b> 100 victory by 0.4368 seconds from Kimball, with Hinchcliffe, Clarke and Plowman rounding out the top five positions. Along with Simmons and Mann, Arie Luyendyk Jr. retired from the race due to mechanical gremlins. With Vernay finishing down the field, his championship lead over Kimball was trimmed to just five points.|$|E

During the New Order authoritarian make press system so {{consequently}} the press is curbed. In contrast, the Reformation reconanced as democratic future, including in terms of press freedom. The purpose of this research are: First, to explain the freedom of the press before the era of the Reformation by Act No. 21 of 1982 on the Principles of the Press and its amendment. Second, to explain the freedom of the press after the Reformation era by Act No. 40 of 1999 on the Press. Third, to explain {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the press before and after the Reformation. From this research, there are three things that concluded. First, freedom of the press before the era of the Reformation by Act No. 21 of 1982 on the Principles of the Press and amendments if traced the articles are shackles for the life of the press, the press is required to issue a license issue this license that can be used to control the editorial contents and banning. Second, freedom of the press after the Reformation era by Act No. 40 of 1999 concerning the Press is to guarantee freedom of the press, because there is no silencing and banning. Third, before the Reformation era Indonesian press called Pancasila press with a free and responsible goals. However, there is no freedom, so no complaints as a result of the deviation of the freedom of the press. However, due to the strict control of the Government of the press lost their identity to carry out its functions independently. Freedom of the press after the Reformation era is done on a national responsibility without limitation license renewal. Disadvantages of the press after the Reformation era is freedom takes precedence over its responsibilities while the excess press after a press Reformation era became an independent institution. Suggestions writer, first to guarantee press freedom ideally built on a foundation of community interest media managers, and the interests of the target service. Secondly, with regard to the interests of community framework is advisable actualization national press freedom, not only will meet the interests unilaterally, either interest manager (source), and the top of the fulfillment of the target interest (public media). The press must be responsive to public situations, because the powerlessness of the public to appreciate his opinion to press leaders should act as a facilitator to be able to appreciate what is desired. <b>Third,</b> <b>freedom</b> of the press after the Reformation era should be retained but remained on its responsibilities so as not to be excessive...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to seek a {{definition}} of freedom of belief and opinion which would allow this freedom to be seen as a human right for a person with psychosis. This study has four research questions: 1) How can the freedom of belief and opinion be understood as a human right? 2) In what kinds of discourses, concepts and presuppositions are the different views of freedom of belief and opinion based? 3) What aspects are relevant when the realization of and interferences with freedom of belief and opinion are considered in the case of an individual with psychosis? 4) How are views about freedom of belief and opinion challenged in the case of an individual with psychosis? In this study materials from different fields are analysed by philosophical conceptual analysis in order to realize interdisciplinary two-way interaction in human rights theory. The material includes: (1) legislation and ethical principles which guide psychiatric care, (2) human rights theory, legislation and conventions concerning the freedom of belief and opinion, (3) textbooks on psychiatric diagnosis, (4) discussions concerning philosophy and the ethics of psychiatry, (5) (political) philosophical discussions concerning freedom and human rights and (6) studies and reports which concentrate on the views and experiences of patients with psychotic disorder. In this study necessary criteria of irrationality (with a loss of insight), being unwell and alienation are presented for a psychotic view of reality in order to distinguish it from other exceptional views of reality. However, it is noted, that in human rights theory the concepts of thought and opinion are defined in such a manner that they also seem to include delusions. Because it is also declared that there is an absolute right to hold thoughts and opinions (forum internum), it seems to follow that a person has an absolute right to hold a delusion. This conclusion challenges the formulations presented in human rights theory and reveals that there is a tension between human rights theory and views on, and the practice of, psychiatry. In order to arrive at an appropriate view of freedom of belief and opinion, three different views concerning the freedom of belief and opinion are analysed in this study and their applicability and the challenges they present in the case of an individual with psychosis are clarified. First, freedom of belief and opinion has been understood in classical human rights discussion in the negative sense, which means that other people do not interfere technically or physically with an individual holding and manifesting his or her beliefs and opinions. Non- and involuntary treatment is seen as an interference in an individual s negative liberty. One problem with this point of view is that when it is applied to a person with psychosis, the consequences seem to be ethically problematic. It seems to follow from this view that the use of involuntary antipsychotic medication is absolutely against an individual s human rights. Alternatively, it might be argued that a person with psychosis is no longer deemed to be entitled to freedom of belief and opinion because as an incompetent person he or she does not fulfil the requirements of this right. This view of freedom does not take into account that the person with psychosis may need help in order to develop and manifest his or her beliefs and opinions and in order to live a life which is sufficiently in accordance with his or her values. If the forum internum was redefined as a negative right to competence, the view of negative liberty might be partly helpful in understanding freedom of belief and opinion. Second, especially in some philosophical and ethical discussions freedom of belief and opinion is understood in terms of authenticity, which means the right to hold such beliefs and opinions which are really one s own and the right to manifest them in a way that is in harmony with them. From this viewpoint, a psychotic disorder which distorts a person s beliefs and opinions can be defined as a violator of authenticity. One problem with this viewpoint is that there are different views about how such authenticity should be evaluated. Moreover, the criteria for any such evaluation seem to be, on the one hand, too demanding in order to understand freedom of belief and opinion as a human right in general. On the other hand, some people with delusions still fulfil these criteria, and should be regarded, because of that, as holding authentic beliefs and opinions and left without treatment. <b>Third,</b> <b>freedom</b> of belief and opinion can be understood in terms of capability, which signifies that the individual is capable of choosing a way of life which he or she considers valuable and which is worthy of human dignity. For example, stigmatization and the undesirable effects of both a psychotic disorder and antipsychotic medication can be seen as impediments to such a capability. This view encourages patients to participate in the treatment and to find their place in society and encourages carers to listen to patients voice including their existential considerations. Because of its background suppositions, the view of capability also seems to be relevant to people with psychosis. For example, the view of capability guides one to understand the forum internum not as something which protects holding thoughts and opinions or believing and thinking processes, but instead as something which protects the abilities needed in believing and thinking. This kind of redefinition would allow one to see the forum internum also as an absolute human right for a person with psychosis. However, one problem with this view is that the relationships between legal rights and what is ethically good are undefined. Moreover, it seems that many decisions are left to be considered individually in each case. This is why a capabilities approach is difficult to apply in a juridical context. However, the view of freedom in terms of capability could be developed in interdisciplinary discussion and cooperation so that juridical challenges concerning freedom of belief and opinion could be discussed and resolved in more detail. In psychiatry, the approach of values-based practice could be used in order to develop the view of freedom of belief and opinion in terms of capability. Developing human rights theory also requires more cooperation between conceptual research and practical psychiatry in order to clarify what we really want to protect under the term freedom of belief and opinion. Tutkimuksessa on kehitetty sellaista uskonnon- ja mielipiteenvapauden ymmärtämistapaa, joka olisi mielekäs myös silloin, kun ihmisellä on psykoottisia harhaluuloja. Tarve uskonnon- ja mielipiteenvapauden teorian kehittämiseen nousee lainsäädännön ja ihmisoikeusteorian sisäisestä ristiriitaisuudesta. Ihmisoikeussopimuksissa on nimittäin määritelty, että ihmisellä on mielensä sisällä ehdoton oikeus ajatuksiinsa ja mielipiteisiinsä eikä tätä oikeutta saa rajoittaa mistään syystä. Näyttää siltä, että kirjaimellisen tulkinnan mukaan ihmisellä on ehdoton oikeus myös omiin harhaluuloihinsa. Tällaista oikeutta ei kuitenkaan tunnusteta mielenterveyslainsäädännössä, koska psykoottista ihmistä voidaan hoitaa ns. pakkohoidossa antipsykoosilääkityksellä, jolla pyritään lieventämään tai poistamaan hänen harhaluulojaan. Tämän ristiriidan vuoksi tässä tutkimuksessa selvitetään kolmen eri vapauskäsityksen näkökulmasta, mitä uskonnon- ja mielipiteenvapaudella on pohjimmiltaan tarkoitus suojata. Klassisen uskonnon- ja mielipiteenvapauden ymmärtämistavan mukaan ihmisen tulee saada pitää omat mielipiteensä ja uskomuksensa ilman, että muut ihmiset pyrkivät niitä muuttamaan konkreettisin pakkokeinoin esimerkiksi lääkitystä käyttämällä. Täysi pidättäytyminen pakkohoidosta olisi kuitenkin eettisesti kyseenalaista potilaan laiminlyöntiä. Tässä ymmärtämistavassa saatetaan myös määritellä uskonnon- ja mielipiteenvapaudelle ehtoja, jotka rajaavat psykoottiset ihmiset näiden oikeuksien ulkopuolelle. Toiseksi on esitetty, että uskonnon- ja mielipiteenvapaus suojaa ihmisen oikeutta niihin uskomuksiin ja ajatuksiin, jotka ovat todella hänen omiaan ja joiden muodostamisprosessia muut ihmiset tai psykoosi sairautena eivät ole vääristäneet. Tämän ymmärtämistavan mukaan pakkohoito on yritys vapauttaa potilas psykoosin vaikutuksesta ja näin palauttaa hänen uskonnon- ja mielipiteenvapautensa. Tämän näkemyksen ongelmana on muun muassa sen idealistinen oletus ihmisyyden luonteesta: oletuksena näyttää olevan, että aitoon ihmisyyteen ei kuulu epärationaalisuus, kärsimys tai pahuus toisia kohtaan. Lisäksi on epäselvää, miten aitous tunnistetaan ja mikseivät harhaluulot voisi ainakin joskus olla ihmisen aitoja uskomuksia. Tutkimuksen mukaan uskonnon- ja mielipiteenvapaus on mielekkäintä ymmärtää valmiuksien näkökulmasta. Tällöin uskonnon- ja mielipiteenvapaus suojaa mahdollisuutta valintoihin, jotka ovat ihmisen oman arvomaailman mukaisia ja jotka turvaavat hänelle ihmisarvoisen elämän. Suojelemisen kohteena eivät ole niinkään uskomusten ja mielipiteiden sisällöt tai uskomus- ja ajatusprosessit, vaan ihmisen kyky ja valmiudet uskomusten ja mielipiteiden muodostamiseen. Jos ihmisoikeusteoriaa kehitetään tähän suuntaan, uskonnon- ja mielipiteenvapaus voidaan nähdä kaikkien ihmisten, myös psykoottisten henkilöiden, ihmisoikeutena. Valmiuksien näkökulmasta psykiatrisessa hoidossa on keskeistä muun muassa se, kuinka potilaan ajattelukykyä, maailmankuvan kehittymistä ja omien arvojen mukaisen elämän mahdollisuuksia tuetaan. Laajemmin uskonnon- ja mielipiteenvapaus kannustaa kehittämään yhteiskuntaa, jossa hulluksi leimautuminen ei muodosta esteitä mielipiteiden esittämiselle ja uskonnolliselle aktiivisuudelle...|$|E
