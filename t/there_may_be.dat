5|$|Crystals {{are often}} {{idealized}} as being perfectly periodic. In that ideal case, the atoms are positioned on a perfect lattice, the electron density is perfectly periodic, and the Fourier transform F(q) is zero except when q {{belongs to the}} reciprocal lattice (the so-called Bragg peaks). In reality, however, crystals are not perfectly periodic; atoms vibrate about their mean position, and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> disorder of various types, such as mosaicity, dislocations, various point defects, and heterogeneity in the conformation of crystallized molecules. Therefore, the Bragg peaks have a finite width and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> significant diffuse scattering, a continuum of scattered X-rays that fall between the Bragg peaks.|$|E
5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is {{a concept}} that eludes precise categorization or definition, and this has caused disquiet amongst some critics. The implication is that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> some unfairness where questionable executive action remains unchallenged. Nonetheless, the concept of justiciability is useful in determining the likelihood of whether an executive action is within the purview of judicial review.|$|E

5|$|Irreversible {{competitive}} antagonists also involve {{competition between}} the agonist and antagonist of the receptor, but the rate of covalent bonding differs and depends on affinity and reactivity of the antagonist. For some antagonist, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a distinct period during which they behave competitively (regardless of basal efficacy), and freely associate to and dissociate from the receptor, determined by receptor-ligand kinetics. But, once irreversible bonding has taken place, the receptor is deactivated and degraded. As for non-competitive antagonists and irreversible antagonists in functional assays with irreversible competitive antagonist drugs, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{a shift in the}} log concentration–effect curve to the right, but, in general, both a decrease in slope and a reduced maximum are obtained.|$|E
5|$|Kohlberg {{suggested}} that <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a seventh stage—Transcendental Morality, or Morality of Cosmic Orientation—which linked religion with moral reasoning.

5|$|Metanephrops challengeri is {{currently}} listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, {{due in part}} to the Quota Management System put in place by the New Zealand government. The species does appear to be declining, however, based both on burrow counts and analyses of catch per unit effort. Estimates of the total population size of M.challengeri vary depending on the methods used. Based on indirect measures, such as burrow counts, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> as many as 28million individuals, and the annual catch might represent only 2%–4% of the total population. Using more reliable figures based on those animals seen during surveys, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> only 2–11million individuals available to trawlers, and the annual catch may remove 12%–28% of that population. Bycatch from the New Zealand scampi fishery has included the New Zealand sea lion, Phocarctos hookeri, which is considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN.|$|E

5|$|Rhabdomyolysis is a {{condition}} in which damaged skeletal muscle breaks down rapidly.

5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
