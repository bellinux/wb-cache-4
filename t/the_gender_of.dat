5|$|Ottawa {{grammatical}} gender classifies nouns as either animate or inanimate.

The {{distinction between the two}} genders also affects verbs through agreement patterns for number and gender. Similarly, demonstrative pronouns agree in gender with the noun they refer to.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> segmentation <b>of</b> occupations {{and the extent to}} which <b>the</b> <b>gendered</b> nature <b>of</b> a technology, or the use of that technology, is transferred from one country to another. Two imported technologies, the postal system and the telephone, are used as case studies to explore <b>the</b> <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> occupations in Meiji Japan. I argue that <b>the</b> <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> these occupations was the outcome of the nature of the imported technologies, the need to make the technology work in local circumstances, the required attributes of employees and prevailing social perceptions <b>of</b> <b>gender.</b> <b>The</b> <b>gender</b> division <b>of</b> labour that resulted was in both cases similar to, but not identical with, that in the countries from which the technologies came. However, <b>the</b> <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> postal occupations in early Meiji was not the subject of any formal consideration by the authorities, whereas the later arrival of the telephone in the early 1890 s was associated with a more carefully planned <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> telephony along <b>the</b> lines of Western industrial economies. In both cases, though, <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> division <b>of</b> labour initially established persisted through much of the 20 th century...|$|R
40|$|The article {{comprehensively}} {{reviews the}} {{theoretical and empirical}} work on <b>gender</b> and <b>the</b> knowledge society and introduces the articles of the special issue. Three {{ways in which the}} knowledge society and economy are <b>gendered</b> are distinguished: <b>the</b> <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> human capital; <b>the</b> <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> networks and <b>the</b> <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> definitions of the knowledge society. Using data from the Labour Force Survey, an original analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gendering</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UK knowledge economy is presented. It finds that the choice of definition of the knowledge economy makes a difference to its <b>gender</b> composition: <b>the</b> more centred on technology and fixed capital, the more masculine, the more centred on human capital, <b>the</b> more <b>gender</b> balanced. <b>The</b> knowledge economy provides better work and conditions. Gender gaps are narrower in the knowledge economy than the overall economy: occupational hierarchies are narrowed to women's advantage, while differences in work temporalities are narrowed to men's advantage...|$|R

5|$|Feminist economists {{often make}} a {{critical}} distinction that masculine bias in economics {{is primarily a}} result of gender, not sex. In other words, when feminist economists highlight the biases of mainstream economics, they focus on its social beliefs about masculinity like objectivity, separation, logical consistency, individual accomplishment, mathematics, abstraction, and lack of emotion, but not on <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> authorities and subjects. However, the over-representation of men among economists and their subjects of study is also a concern.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{challenges}} in assessing progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences.

Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Mayan languages is {{simpler than}} that of other Mesoamerican languages, yet its morphology is still considered agglutinating and polysynthetic.

Possessed nouns are marked for person of possessor. In Mayan languages, nouns are not marked for case and gender is not explicitly marked.

5|$|Typologically, Erromintxela {{displays}} the same features as the Basque dialects it derives its grammatical structures from. Its case marking follows the ergative–absolutive pattern where {{the subject of}} an intransitive verb is in the absolutive case (which is unmarked), the same case being used for the direct object of a transitive verb. The subject of a transitive verb is marked with the ergative case. Similarly, auxiliary verbs agree with the subject and any direct object and indirect object present and verb forms are marked for allocutive (i.e. a marker is used to indicate <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> the addressee).|$|E
