5|$|Bethe {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>research</b> on supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, {{and other}} problems in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties. In doing this, he collaborated with Gerald E. Brown of Stony Brook University. In 1978, Brown proposed that they collaborate on supernovae. These were reasonably well understood by this time, but the calculations were still a problem. Using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics, and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions, Bethe tackled the problems involved in stellar gravitational collapse, {{and the way in}} which various factors affected a supernova explosion. Once again, he was able to reduce the problem to a set of differential equations, and solve them.|$|E
5|$|Both Gray and Torrey {{were elected}} to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in December 1841. Gray never {{returned}} to teach a course at Michigan. In 1833 Dr.Joshua Fisher, a resident of Beverly, Massachusetts, and a Harvard University alumnus, bequeathed $20,000 to Harvard to endow a chair in natural history. The university allowed the proceeds to accumulate until it could fund a full year's salary for a professor. Because of this and a few problems in finding a suitable professor, this chair was not filled until it was formally offered to Gray on March26, 1842. The offer was $1,000/year salary, teaching duties limited to only botany, and being superintendent of Harvard's botanic garden. While the salary was low, the teaching limitation, rare for the time, allowed him plenty of time <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>research</b> {{and work in the}} botanic garden. After an exchange of letters, Gray accepted this appointment as Fisher Professor of Natural History at Harvard. The formal appointment was made April30, 1842. Gray arrived at Harvard on July22, 1842, and began his duties in September. He did not have to teach in the fall of 1842, but began in spring 1843, the first classes he had taught in nine years. Early in his years at Harvard, Gray had to borrow money from his father. Soon he was able to repay his father and help his family because he supplemented his income by giving lectures outside of Harvard, including at the Lowell Institute. Gray was considered a weak lecturer, but because of his expert knowledge, he was highly regarded by his peers. His skills were better suited to teaching advanced rather than introductory classes. He also gained renown for his textbooks and high quality illustrations. Gray moved into {{what became known as the}} Asa Gray House in the Botanic Garden in the summer of 1844. It had been built in 1810 for William Dandridge Peck and later occupied by Thomas Nuttall. As the demands of teaching, collecting, selling specimens, taking care of the herbarium, and writing books increased and he himself was not a good illustrator, Gray found it necessary to hire a botanical illustratorIsaac Sprague, who illustrated much of Gray's works for decades to come.|$|E

25|$|The USSR also {{captured}} {{a number of}} V-2s and staff, letting them set up in Germany for a time. The first work contracts were signed {{in the middle of}} 1945.

The first Soviet missile was the R-1, a duplicate of the V-2. Most of the German team was sent home after that project but some remained <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>research</b> until as late as 1951. Unknown to the Germans, work immediately began on larger missiles, the R-2 and R-5, based on extension of the V-2 technology.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} many {{operating}} systems that were significant in their day but are no longer so, such as AmigaOS; OS/2 from IBM and Microsoft; classic Mac OS, the non-Unix precursor to Apple's macOS; BeOS; XTS-300; RISC OS; MorphOS; Haiku; BareMetal and FreeMint. Some are still used in niche markets {{and continue to be}} developed as minority platforms for enthusiast communities and specialist applications. OpenVMS, formerly from DEC, is still under active development by Hewlett-Packard. Yet other operating systems are used almost exclusively in academia, for operating systems education or <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>research</b> on operating system concepts. A typical example of a system that fulfills both roles is MINIX, while for example Singularity is used purely for research.|$|E

25|$|Jones was {{rejected}} by all the Welsh universities, so he applied to the University of Edinburgh for an undergraduate degree, which had a closing date seven days later, and he was accepted onto a zoology undergraduate course. He stayed on in Edinburgh <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>research</b> for a Doctor of Philosophy degree on the ecological genetics of Cepaea, a snail whose shell is polymorphic in colour pattern, making it a model organism for evolutionary biologists. He developed an interest in snails from the late Bryan Clarke, one of his teachers at Edinburgh and subsequently professor of genetics at the University of Nottingham. After his PhD, Jones also completed post-doctoral research into the genetics of Drosophila at the University of Chicago to widen his experience. Much of Jones' research has been concerned with snails and the light their study can shed on biodiversity and genetics.|$|E
