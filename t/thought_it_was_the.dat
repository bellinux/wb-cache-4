In 1955, following the television broadcast of an adaptation of Fleming's earlier novel Casino Royale, Warner Bros. expressed an interest in Live and Let Die, and offered $500 for an option, against $5,000 if the film was made.

5|$|German forces also {{operated}} in the Battle of Jarama, {{which began with}} a Nationalist offensive on 6 February 1937. It included German-supplied ground forces, including two batteries of machine guns, a tank division, and the Condor Legion's anti-aircraft guns. Bombing by both Republican and Nationalist aircraft helped ensure a stalemate. It showed up the inadequacy of the Legion's aircraft, faced with superior Soviet-made fighters. The Legion's efforts only partly mitigated what was a significant defeat for the Nationalists at the Battle of Guadalajara during March. A joint Italian-German general {{had been set up}} in January 1937 to advise Franco on war planning. The defeat of a significant Italian force and the growing Soviet superiority in tanks and aircraft led the Germans to support a plan to abandon the offensive on Madrid and instead concentrate a series of attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas. While many countries believed motorised troops to have been proven less effective than first <b>thought,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> inadequacy of the Italians as a fighting force that dominated German thought.|$|E

In the movement of the 2nd Battalion and C and Headquarters Batteries, Daly was wounded a second time and was evacuated. The 2nd Battalion cleared the pass before midnight. On the west side it came under light attack but was able to continue its advance all the way to Taejong-ni, where it held position for the rest of the night.|$|E
25|$|Several {{groups of}} the conspirators {{surrounded}} the houses of the Prime Minister Dimitrije Cincar-Marković and senior officers loyal to King Alexander. Guard Lieutenant Petar Živković, on duty that night, unlocked {{the gate of the}} royal palace at 2:00 AM. As the conspirators entered the building the electric lighting was switched off throughout the palace. While several officers of the Royal Guard were involved in the plot, the majority of the guards on duty were not. However in the darkness and confusion they did not attempt an effective defense. Searching for the royal couple was unsuccessful for nearly two hours. During this time, Captain Jovan Miljković, an aide familiar with the conspiracy but who refused to participate, and Mihailo Naumović (unknown to the conspirators) were killed. The doors to the King’s bedroom were shattered with dynamite, but no one was in the bed. Unknown to the others, Apis spotted someone escaping down the stairs into the courtyard.

25|$|There {{are many}} other recent {{narratives}} extolling the divinity of the goddess, which are also linked to Shirdi Sai Baba and his devotees. In one such narration, a priest of Vani village known as Kakaji Vaidya who {{was working in the}} Saptashrungi Temple was quite disturbed by the miseries of life around him and he, therefore, appealed to the goddess to give him peace of mind and relieve him from all worries. Pleased with the priest's devotion to her, the goddess appeared to him in a dream and told him to go to the Baba to set his mind at rest and in peace. As the priest was then not aware of which Baba she meant, he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Shiva at Trimabakeshwar temple and so he went there and offered worship to Shiva and stayed there for a few days. In the process, he still did not get the feeling of peace and his restless mood continued. He came back to Vani village disheartened. Then, every day after taking bath in the morning he offered prayers to Shiva Linga by reciting Rudra mantra from the Yajurveda, for many days. He still did not get peace of mind. He then went back to the Mata temple and appealed to her to give relief to his restless mind. That night she appeared in his dream and told that the Baba she meant was Sai Samarth of Shirdi and that he should go there. The priest did not know the whereabouts of Sai Baba. Sai Baba through his divine psychic perception realised the need of the priest and so he sent his most loving devotee Madhavarao to meet the priest and bring him to his presence. Coincidentally, Madhavrao had also gone there at the advice of Baba to also offer two silver breasts to the goddess as his mother had forgotten to fulfill her vow of gifting the silver breasts to the goddess. When Madhavarao went to Vani village the priest met him and came to know that he had come from Shirdi to offer silver breast to the goddess. The priest was very pleased, and also for the first time felt peace of mind. He then took Madhavarao to the temple where the silver breasts were placed {{at the feet of the}} goddess in the sanctum as a fulfilment of his mother's vow. The priest then came to Shirdi with Madhavarao and had darshan of the Sai Baba and stayed there for 12 days and felt very peaceful. He then returned to Vani.|$|E

40|$|Contemporary feminist theorists {{typically}} {{regard the}} notion of transcendence with suspicion. By “transcendence” is meant “going beyond” or “surpassing” a limit or context. The problem {{for a number of}} feminists is that, certainly in Western <b>thought,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> body, and the material world more generally, that is usually identified as the limit to overcome and so transcend. Given that Western culture traditionally associates bodiliness and materiality with the female sex, “woman” has come to represent the constraints of material immanence, and women are thus devalued in the process. In The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir famously laments the way in which women, defined as the “other” by men, are “doomed” to immanence (29, 726). She urges women to claim transcendence for themselves and, in doing so, to realize their freedom and subjectivity. However, de Beauvoir is often criticized by later feminists for perpetuating patriarchal conceptions of transcendence and immanence...|$|R

40|$|Masuho Zanko was a "vulgar" Shintoist active {{mainly in}} the first half of the eighteenth century.
