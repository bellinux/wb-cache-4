50|$|<b>The</b> <b>organ</b> {{was removed}} from the Music Hall in 1884 to provide more {{performing}} space for the Boston Symphony. Initially put into storage, <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> was rebuilt and installed by <b>the</b> Methuen <b>Organ</b> Company in <b>the</b> Serlo <b>Organ</b> Hall in Methuen, Massachusetts, which was built to house <b>the</b> <b>organ.</b> <b>The</b> <b>organ</b> was later rebuilt again and augmented by <b>the</b> Aeolian-Skinner <b>Organ</b> Company.

50|$|On 1 December 2016, the Dr. Shane Moran {{installed}} {{an historic}} Australian made Fincham & Hobday <b>organ</b> into <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> chamber at Swifts. <b>The</b> <b>organ</b> {{was built in}} 1885 by Fincham & Hobday, Adelaide for the Congregational Church, Gawler, South Australia. The façade of <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> was decorated by Heinrich Ludwig Vosz (1812-1886). In 2011 <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> was gifted to <b>the</b> <b>Organ</b> Historical Trust of Australia. In 2015, Dr and Mrs Moran purchased <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> and engaged Hargraves Pipe Organs Pty Ltd of Mt Evelyn, Victoria, to undertake substantial restoration work {{over the course of}} more than a year, resulting in <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> being restored to its former grandeur.|$|R
5|$|The {{surrounded}} sac {{becomes the}} primitive gut. Sections of this gut begin to differentiate into <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> of the gastrointestinal tract, {{such as the}} esophagus, stomach, and intestines. The esophagus develops {{as part of the}} foregut tube. The innervation of the esophagus develops from the pharyngeal arches.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} that bathes <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> in hemolymph. The heart has three chambers: two {{auricles}} receiving blood from the gills, and a single ventricle. The ventricle is muscular and pumps hemolymph into the aorta, {{and then to the}} rest of the body. Some bivalves have a single aorta, but most also have a second, usually smaller, aorta serving the hind parts of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital organs, and <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>organ</b> {{was built}} in 1891 by <b>the</b> Schuelke <b>Organ</b> Company. <b>The</b> <b>organ</b> at St. Boniface {{is one of the}} few intact Schuelke organs that still exist today. Aside from regular maintenance, <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> has {{remained}} basically unaltered over the years.

5|$|Different {{national}} {{styles of}} organ building began to develop, often due to changing political climates. In the Netherlands, the organ became a large instrument with several divisions, doubled ranks, and mounted cornets. <b>The</b> <b>organs</b> of northern Germany also had more divisions, and independent pedal divisions became increasingly common. The {{divisions of the}} organ became visibly discernible from the case design. 20th-century musicologists labelled this the Werkprinzip.|$|E
5|$|Identification of AVMs {{requires}} detailed {{medical imaging}} of <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> most commonly affected by these lesions. Not all AVMs cause symptoms or {{are at risk}} of doing so, and hence there is a degree of variation between specialists as to whether such investigations would be performed, and by which modality; often, decisions on this issue are reached together with the patient.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{from cancer}} of <b>the</b> <b>organs,</b> {{such as the}} stomach or liver (visceral pain), is diffuse and {{difficult}} to locate, and {{is often referred to}} more distant, usually superficial, sites. Invasion of soft tissue by a tumor can cause pain by inflammatory or mechanical stimulation of pain sensors, or destruction of mobile structures such as ligaments, tendons and skeletal muscles.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>organ</b> {{was built}} in 1877 by Stumm of Rhaunensulzbach. Donations for <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> came, amongst others, from the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar. <b>The</b> <b>organ,</b> renovated in 1998, has 1,350 pipes.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>organ</b> {{dates back}} to an {{instrument}} that was built in 1817 by <b>the</b> <b>organ</b> builder De Volder. The style of the front is fully made in gothic revival.

5|$|Some redback {{males have}} been {{observed}} using an alternative tactic that also ensures more of their genetic material is passed on. Juvenile female redbacks nearing their final moulting and adulthood have fully formed reproductive organs, but lack openings in the exoskeleton that allow access to <b>the</b> <b>organs.</b> Males will bite through the exoskeleton and deliver sperm without performing the somersault seen in males mating with adult females. The females then moult {{within a few days}} and deliver a clutch of fertilised eggs.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion, after which <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>organs</b> of {{farm animals}} came from slaughterhouses, while {{fishermen}} supplied those of pinnipeds {{and the smaller}} whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was {{able to continue to}} collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.|$|E

5|$|The thorax, which {{develops}} from segments 2, 3 and 4 of the larva, {{consists of}} three invisibly divided segments, namely prothorax, metathorax and mesothorax. <b>The</b> <b>organs</b> of insect locomotion – the legs and wings – are borne on the thorax. The forelegs spring from the prothorax, the forewings and middle pair of legs are borne on the mesothorax, and the hindwings and hindlegs arise from the metathorax. In some cases, the wings are vestigial.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves {{relative to their}} brain size, <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> responsible for {{a heightened sense of}} smell. This suggests that the sense of smell was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The sense of smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed, in his Philosophie Zoologique of 1809, {{a theory}} of the {{transmutation}} of species (transformisme). Lamarck {{did not believe that}} all living things shared a common ancestor but rather that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck recognized that species adapted to their environment. He explained this by saying that the same innate force driving increasing complexity caused <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of those organs, just as exercise affects muscles. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of acquired characteristics that would become known as Lamarckism and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Later, upon {{visiting the}} grave of Graves, Mulder and Scully learn of his suicide {{and the death of}} his {{daughter}} at a young age, a daughter who would be Lauren's age were she still alive. Scully suspects that Graves faked his death, but on consulting the pathologist who examined his body and testing <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> he donated to others it is proved that he indeed died. Lauren meanwhile witnesses a vision at night, including blood appearing in the bathtub, that leads her to believe that Graves was murdered. At her going-away party, Lauren is threatened by Dorlund, who believes she has knowledge of confidential information that could implicate him. Lauren calls Mulder and Scully to her home, but before the agents can get there, two assassins hired by Dorlund arrive to kill her. An invisible force kills both of them, just as Mulder and Scully arrive (with Mulder witnessing the body of one of the assassins being hanged in midair).|$|E
5|$|Like other crustaceans, malacostracans {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} in which the heart pumps blood into the hemocoel (body cavity) where it {{supplies}} the needs of <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> for oxygen and nutrients before diffusing back to the heart. The typical respiratory pigment in malacostracans is haemocyanin. Structures that function as kidneys are located near the base of the antennae. A brain exists in the form of ganglia close to the antennae, there are ganglia in each segment and a collection of major ganglia below the oesophagus. Sensory organs include compound eyes (often stalked), ocelli (simple eyes), statocysts and sensory bristles. The naupliar eye is a characteristic of the nauplius larva and consists of four cup-shaped ocelli facing in different directions and able to distinguish between light and darkness.|$|E
5|$|Mummification was a {{tradition}} that many other pre-Columbian civilisations practiced. On the Altiplano, the habit of conserving the dead started in the Herrera Period, around the 5th century AD. The Muisca continued this culture and prepared their deceased beloved {{members of the society}} by putting the bodies above fires. The heat would dry the body and the phenol conserve <b>the</b> <b>organs</b> and protect them from decomposition, a process that took up to eight hours. After drying, the bodies were wrapped in cotton cloths and placed in caves, buried, or in some cases placed on elevated platforms inside temples, such as the Sun Temple. The position of the mummies was with their arms folded across the chest and the hands around the chin, while the legs were placed over the abdomen. During the preparation of the mummies, the Muisca played music and sang songs honouring their dead. The habit of mummification continued well into the colonial period; the youngest mummies found date from {{the second half of the}} 18th century.|$|E
