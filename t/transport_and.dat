40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>transport</b> costs <b>and</b> unemployment in South Africa is under researched, mostly {{due to a}} lack of appropriate data. However, two surveys—the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS) and the Labour Market Entry Survey (LMES) —have recently collected information on transport costs. This thesis uses these new sources of data to examine three aspects of the {{relationship between}} <b>transport</b> costs <b>and</b> unemployment in South Africa. The first is the relationship between <b>transport</b> costs <b>and</b> the probability of searching for employment. The second is the relationship between reservation wages <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> costs. The third is the relationship between <b>transport</b> premiums <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> costs, with a focus on commute times as a proxy for transport costs. This research shows: the negative correlation between job search <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> costs; a positive correlation between median <b>transports</b> costs <b>and</b> reservations wages for jobs that are far; negative correlation between <b>transport</b> premiums <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> costs...|$|R
