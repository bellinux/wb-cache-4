40|$|AbstractThe cement {{industry}} faces a unique challenge in reducing {{greenhouse gas emissions}} owing to the large amount, 5 % of global <b>total,</b> of <b>process</b> <b>emissions</b> originating from the calcination of limestone. Oxygen combustion is considered the most promising technological option as the energy penalty for capturing the CO 2 is only associated with the fuel, as opposed to post combustion capture where sorbent regeneration is required for both fuel and process CO 2. While more attractive, the implementation of oxygen combustion and the necessary flue gas recycling, will alter process conditions. As a result, significant research is required to produce a viable design for the complete conversion to oxygen combustion. The conversion will require modifications to every component of the plant {{with the exception of}} the quarry and finish grinding sections. The plant boundary will also expand to include an oxygen production facility and a CO 2 compression station. While the cost of the additions can be quantified, the final cost will be a balance between the modifications and revenues from increased production...|$|R

40|$|Large-scale {{composting}} {{facilities are}} known to cause environmental problems, mainly through pungent air emitted by composting material. In air samples taken above stacks set up to prepare compost used as a substrate in mushroom cultivation, several volatile compounds were identified {{by means of the}} coupled techniques of gas chromatography and mass spectrography. Among the compounds identified, sulfur-containing compounds [H 2 S, COS, CH 3 SH, CS 2, (CH 3) 2 S, (CH 3) 2 S 2, and (CH 3) 2 S 3] are the most conspicuous in causing a nuisance. Quantification of these compounds was performed by concentrating a relatively small air sample on Tenax GC. The sampling method appeared to be very useful under field conditions. During the composting process, the concentration of the volatile sulfur compounds in emitted air ranged from 1 to 35 μmol/m 3. The highest concentrations were obtained {{at the end of the}} outdoor <b>process.</b> <b>Total</b> sulfur <b>emission</b> amounted to 8. 3 mg of sulfur per kg (fresh weight) of compost. The end product still contained 2. 58 g of sulfur per kg (fresh weight) of compost. Suggestions about the origin of the volatile sulfur compounds are made...|$|R

Field samples were adsorbed from air on Tenax cartridges and analyzed {{in the laboratory}} by thermal desorption and gas chromatography. The emissions from a large thermomechanical pulp (TMP) plant consisted mainly of chemically unchanged hydrocarbon monoterpenes from the wood. The major monoterpenes were alpha-pinene (> 50 %) and beta-pinene (20 - 30 %). The proportions of ten additional components were determined in the <b>process</b> <b>emissions,</b> which may be recovered to turpentine.

40|$|Optical {{emissions}} from the laser welding {{process can be}} obtained relatively easy in real-time. Such emissions come from the melt pool, keyhole, or plume during welding. Therefore it is very beneficial to establish a clear relation between characteristics of these emissions and the resulting weld quality or the ocurrence of welding defects {{for any of the}} laser ype currently used in industry. Most commonly used in continuous wave (CW) laser welding applications are the CO 2 laser, Nd:YAG laser, diode, disk and fiber lasers. The disk lasers are relatively new and need to be characterized with respect to the nature of their plasma or plume generation. In this paper, the <b>process</b> <b>emissions</b> during laser welding of AISI 304 stainless steel with disk laser and Nd:YAG laser are compared.

Substantial temporal and spatial variability was observed in all seasons and attributed, in part, to the batch nature of operations, <b>process</b> <b>emission</b> variabil-ity and frequent work interruptions. The need for fine mapping grids was demonstrated, where elevations in particle concentrations were highly localized. Ultrafine particle concentrations were generally greatest during winter when incoming make-up air was heated with direct fire, natural gas burners. Make-up air drawn from roof level had elevated respirable mass and ul-trafine number concentrations above ambient outdoor levels, suggesting inadvertent recircula-tion of foundry <b>process</b> <b>emissions.</b> Elevated respirable mass concentrations were highly localized on occasions (e. g. abrasive blasting and grinding), depended on the area within the facility where measurements were obtained, but were largely unaffected by season. Particle sources were further characterized by measuring their respective number and mass concentra-tions by particle size. Sources that contributed to ultrafine particles included process-specific sources (e. g. melting and pouring operations), and non-process sources (e. g. direct fire natural gas heating units, a liquid propane-fuelled sweeper and cigarette smoking) were additionally identified...|$|R
