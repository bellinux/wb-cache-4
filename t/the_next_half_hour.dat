500|$|On 17 August 1943 Specht led {{the group}} from Gilze en Rijen on an {{intercept}} and sighted the [...] B-17 Flying Fortresses of 381 Bombing Group near Antwerp.

50|$|By consent, Francis Maginn {{was given}} the floor, and he spoke eloquently for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> or so about the need of an {{organised}} association that would command respect and watch other {{the interests of the}} deaf people in Britain, whether these interests be educational, moral or social.|$|R
60|$|Jim {{never asked}} no questions, {{he never said}} a word; but the way he worked for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> showed {{about how he was}} scared. By that time {{everything}} we had in the world was on our raft, and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid. We put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing, and didn't show a candle outside after that.|$|R
60|$|For <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> no {{word was}} spoken in the boat. Dick {{kept his eyes}} fixed on the {{opposite}} bank. Suddenly he touched the lieutenant.|$|E

50|$|Kids of Workers (Chinese: 《工人的孩子》) {{was created}} in 2007 in Chengdu, China, where he welded and sealed himself in a cage which was hung on a tree {{clustered}} by flowers.

25|$|Obdurate {{continued}} {{to investigate the}} surface contact and subsequently located two German submarines. Coming under attack from one of these submarines, the destroyer dropped depth charges before turning away to attack the Zeppelin. As the destroyer closed on it, though, the Zeppelin turned away to the south-east. Within the space of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour,</b> Dublin was unsuccessfully attacked by the German submarines {{at least three times}} with torpedoes, leading Dumaresq to conclude that the Germans were attempting to spring a trap on the British vessels. He subsequently ordered Obdurate to complete its investigation of the suspect vessel, which was subsequently determined to be a Dutch fishing vessel.|$|R
60|$|When the Franc-tireurs des Écoles {{assembled}} <b>the</b> <b>next</b> morning, <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> {{was given}} for consultation; then {{the vote was}} taken, and Henri Vancour was declared elected first Lieutenant of the company composed entirely of the art students, the Captain being François des Valles, who belonged to an old provincial family, a tall, dark, handsome young man, extremely popular among his comrades.|$|R
60|$|The time, now, was twenty-three {{minutes past}} twelve. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour,</b> at most, would decide the {{question}} of whether he would, or would not, get up from his bed, and leave the room.|$|E
60|$|During <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> {{hardly a}} word was spoken, so {{occupied}} were all hands with watching the stranger, which approached very slowly, {{and at the}} end of that time she was almost within hailing distance.|$|E
60|$|With this understanding, Master Plummer {{agreed to}} his friend's proposal, and during <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> Joe laboured {{faithfully}} at the housework, while Plums amused the princess, {{when it was}} possible for him to do so without too great an exertion.|$|E
2500|$|The Guardian {{published}} on 30 March 2007 a story detailing inconsistencies between an account Blair gave of {{his involvement in}} the Balcombe Street Siege on the night of 6 December 1975, and the recollections of others involved at the time. In a 2006 interview, Blair had stated: [...] "We turned the corner, and there is the car ... It was a very defining moment. I think I spent <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> pretending to be a bush. They {{got out of the car}} and started firing at us.

6000|$|... "Stay {{where you}} are," [...] Wilhelmina {{answered}} shortly. Her {{eyes were fixed}} upon the tall, lithe figure once more facing <b>the</b> bowler. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> ball was <b>the</b> last of the over. Macheson played it carefully for a single, and stood prepared for the bowling at the other end. He began by a graceful cut for two, and followed it up by a square leg hit clean out of the ground. For <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour,</b> <b>the</b> Thorpe villagers thoroughly enjoyed themselves. Never {{since the days of}} one Foulds, a former blacksmith, had they seen such an exhibition of hurricane hitting. The fast bowler, knocked clean off his length, became wild and erratic. Once he only missed Macheson's head by an inch, but his next ball was driven fair and square out of the ground for six. The applause became frantic.|$|R
60|$|Inside of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> he {{had covered}} a {{territory}} of many yards {{on both sides}} of the brook. In one spot he had seen several drops of blood and the finger marks of a bloody hand. Yellow Elk, however, had completely disappeared.|$|E
60|$|For <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> {{the door}} at the further end of the room {{continued}} to open and close, devouring, ogre-fashion, each time some dainty human morsel, now chorus gentleman, now chorus lady. Conversation among our thinning ranks became more fitful, a growing anxiety making for silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Must I?" [...] said she, plaintively. And {{then she}} sat for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> {{with her head}} against his shoulder; but nothing more was said about it. They both acquiesced in the {{sentence}} that had been pronounced against them, and went on together more lovingly than before.|$|E
60|$|Knight in his perplexity {{stood still}} for a moment, and {{collected}} his thoughts. The vicar's account {{of the fall of}} the tower was that the workmen had been undermining it all the day, and had left in the evening intending to give the finishing stroke <b>the</b> <b>next</b> morning. <b>Half</b> an <b>hour</b> after they had gone the undermined angle came down. The woman who was half buried, as it seemed, must have been beneath it at the moment of the fall.|$|R
5000|$|The EU {{parking disc}} design was {{introduced}} in 2000 and the old designs abolished in 2003. This gave rise to some confusion among car drivers since the old parking regulations denoted [...] "1:30 h" [...] of maximum parking time while the new parking regulations imposed a limit of [...] "1 hour".

In the evening worship, which begins at 6:00 PM, begins with the Divviti Salam (salute with torches) ceremony. Two men go round the temple; one holds a torch and the other plays a drum. The rituals offered in the evening are {{similar to that of the}} morning worship. The importance given to music is the major deviation. Night offering is provided to the deity. Devotees are allowed to have a glimpse of the deity for <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> from 8:30 PM. At 9:00 PM, sayana seva (sleeping ritual) is performed an the temple is closed.|$|R

60|$|After {{considerable}} {{discussion with}} Tim {{he decided to}} leave it behind the cane-board {{where it would be}} screened from view, and then a crowd of customers suddenly appearing, he was so busy during <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> that he hardly had time to think of that which had been intrusted to his keeping.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> was one Ben never forgot. The rebels evidently {{thought they}} had the Americans at their mercy and pushed in closer and closer, until {{more than half of}} the contestants were {{fighting}} hand to hand. Many had exhausted their ammunition, and were using their bayonets or else handling their guns as clubs.|$|E
5000|$|... "D" [...] Company's attack went in {{as planned}} at 0400 hours on 30 March. Finding their line of retreat {{cut off the}} German paratroopers decided to stand and fight. After seven hours of bitter street {{fighting}} a truce was called to evacuate the wounded on both sides. Making use of the truce, Sweeting issued the German commander an ultimatum, surrender within <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> or be totally destroyed. Realizing his position hopeless, the German commander surrendered. Of the original company from the 17th Fallschirmjäger Regiment of the 6th Fallschirmjäger Division garrisoning Netterden, only 2 officers and 22 soldiers survived to go into captivity as prisoners of war. During their two days in the area the battalion captured a total of 2 enemy officers and 128 other ranks {{at a cost of}} 4 Camerons killed and 10 wounded. For his successful company attack on Netterden Major Sweeting received the Distinguished Service Order.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a letter}} <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day. <b>Half</b> an <b>hour</b> after {{receiving}} it I found Cecile sunk {{down on the floor}} of her apartment, upon which all her wardrobe was strewn about as if to be packed up. She fell into my arms weeping passionately, and declaring she must leave us. to leave us and set up her menage with her husband had always been her ambition, so it was plain that this was not what she meant; but for a long time she neither would nor could tell me, or moan out anything but a 'convent,' 'how could he?' and 'my children.' ...|$|R
40|$|A late {{afternoon}} and two elderly people sit on an old, steel, wire-sprung camp stretcher bed. They sit back-to-back, engaging in {{commentary on the}} vehicles and people that pass them by. One of them, the old man, says suddenly, 2 ̆ 7 Me! I 2 ̆ 7 m number one singer myself! 2 ̆ 7 Without hesitation the old woman says, simply and bluntly, 2 ̆ 7 Bullshit! 2 ̆ 7 For <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> <b>the</b> dialogue between the two never varies though the utterances increase both in auditory levels and passion. To the outside observer the dialogue seems simple and nonsensical. However {{in the world of}} Yanyuwa music, composition and performance these two people - in their old age in the early 1980 s - are unique. The old man Jerry Brown Ngarnawakajarra and the old woman Elma Brown a-Bunubunu are the last two people in Yanyuwa society to have had revealed to them what in this article we will call 2 ̆ 7 dream state 2 ̆ 7 songs...|$|R

Our boat is on the beach, the FOAM CREST not two miles out at sea, and my husband will be here, under this very roof, within <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> perhaps. Sure! there is naught to hinder us. Chauvelin and his gang have not yet arrived." ...|$|E
60|$|Doctor Gys had rather impatiently {{awaited the}} young man's return to {{consciousness}} {{that he might}} complete his examination. He now devoted <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> to a careful diagnosis of Denton's injuries. By this time the patient was suffering intense pain and a hypodermic injection of morphine was required to relieve him. When at last he was quietly drowsing the doctor called Maud aside to give her instructions.|$|E
50|$|The {{prison was}} {{surrounded}} {{by the police and}} roads leading to the prison were closed at 5.45 pm. At around this time the prisoners broke into the prison's armouries and took arms including assault rifles. At around 6.15 pm five prisoners broke out of the prison and tried to escape on a trishaw. They opened fire at the STF who returned fire killing four of the prisoners. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour</b> there was heavy gunfights between the prisoners in the prison and the authorities outside. There was a power cut in the area at 6.25 pm which added more confusion to the situation. The authorities tried to storm the prison several times but had to withdraw after coming under fire from the prisoners. The army was called in, bringing with it an armoured car. The authorities had then planned to storm the prison at 8 pm but this had to be postponed due heavy rains. Eventually, at 2 am, the STF stormed the prison and took full control of the prison.|$|R

5000|$|Beladingala Baale is {{the tale}} of a chess player Revanth (Anant Nag). Revanth is the only Grand-master from India and gains {{worldwide}} fame when he becomes the world champion by beating Polonski, the reigning world champion. He returns to Bangalore where he works as an assistant executive for Kanara Advertising Service. Revanth is congratulated by all his colleagues including his boss and close friend James (Ramesh Bhat). He is, however, disappointed because he even though he has won an international tournament, he has absolutely no fans, very limited press coverage and no sort of recognition from the society.While he is expressing his disappointment to James, he gets a call from a lady who claims that she is his fan and is calling to congratulate him personally. However, she refuses to reveal her name, instead challenges Revanth to identify her within <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>half</b> an <b>hour,</b> with <b>the</b> only clue that her name starts with R. He takes up the challenge. James and Revanth start writing down the Hindu names starting with R. Revanth is interrupted by his boss, who asks him to conduct the interviews for batch of candidates. Revanth intelligently takes the interview where he asks all candidates to write Hindu names starting with letter R. After 10 minutes, Revanth has with him lots of Indian names starting with R but is still not able to identify the mystery woman. The lady disconnects the call as she gets offended by some of the names suggested by Revanth [...] - [...] which were actually provided to Revanth by James.|$|R
