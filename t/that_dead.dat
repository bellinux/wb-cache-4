25|$|The show's {{complete}} {{ratings were}} not released, though executives had claimed {{to at least}} one reporter <b>that</b> <b>Dead</b> Like Me had ratings three times Showtime's primetime average. This contrasts with the network's statement that the ratings were not high enough for a third season. The ratings for the series premiere were 1.11 million, a record for a Showtime series premiere that was not beaten until the premiere of Shameless seven years later.|$|E

Due to the success of this research, they can recreate these smells and train dogs on what exactly to search for, making these animals much more effective in aiding with homicide cases.|$|E
25|$|Hydrologists {{from the}} University of Colorado have {{investigated}} the impacts of beetle-infested forests on the water cycle, in particular, snow accumulation and melt. They concluded <b>that</b> <b>dead</b> forests will accumulate more snowpack {{as a result of}} thinner tree canopies and decreased snow sublimation. These thinned canopies also cause faster snow melt by allowing more sunlight through to the forest floor and lowering the snowpack albedo, as a result of needle litter on the snow surface. Augmented snowpack coupled with dead trees that no longer transpire will likely lead to more available water.|$|E
25|$|Dead Block was {{met with}} mixed to {{negative}} reviews from critics. Aggregating websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 60.71% and 63/100 and the Xbox 360 version 49.63% and 50/100. Metacritic reported a wide range in scores, with the lowest score of a 20% approval given by Nick Hartel of Video Game Talk to an 83% approval from ZT Game Domain's Michael Futter. As of year end 2011 the Xbox 360 version sold 35,625 copies.

25|$|Although {{the exact}} {{mechanism}} of the generation of dsDNA antibodies is still unknown, {{it is likely that}} extracellular DNA is one cause of an immune response against dsDNA. There {{is a great deal of}} evidence supporting the idea <b>that</b> <b>dead</b> or dying cells are one major source of this extracellular DNA. Apoptosis is the highly organised process of programmed cell death in which the cell degrades the nuclear DNA and signals for phagocytosis. In people with SLE and other autoimmune disorders this process is thought to be defective, causing either an increase in cell death and/or a decrease in the rate of dead cell clearance.|$|E
25|$|No {{explicit}} {{regulations are}} expressed in the bible concerning the treatment of a corpse itself, although historic rabbinical sources saw an implication that the dead should be thoroughly washed per Ecclesiastes, as children are washed when born; according to Eliezer ben Joel HaLevi, a prominent rishon, argued that the corpse should be cleansed carefully, including the ears and fingers, with nails pared and hair combed, so that the corpse could be laid {{to rest in the}} manner that the person had visited the synagogue during life. Washing of corpses was not observed among the Jews living in Persian Babylon, for which they were criticised as dying in filth, without a candle and without a bath; at the time, the non-Jewish Persians were predominantly Zoroastrian, and consequently believed <b>that</b> <b>dead</b> bodies were inherently ritually unclean, and should be exposed to the elements in a Tower of Silence to avoid defiling the earth with them.|$|E

500|$|Dead Head Fred {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. [...] The game's writing and dialogue were considered the main {{strengths of the}} game, with GameSpy's reviewer stating that [...] "In the vast sea of PSP titles, Dead Head Fred stands 'head and shoulders' above the rest." [...] IGN said [...] "The tale of revenge in a dark world is twisted [...] unapologetically humorous". [...] Other publications were not as impressed, however, with one reviewer stating [...] "...the overused profanity just makes it feel like it's been designed by teenagers desperately trying to be edgy." [...] The game's supernatural themes elicited comparisons to The Darkness and Grim Fandango. GamesRadar included it in their list of the 100 most overlooked games of its generation. Editor Jason Fanelli felt that PSP games often lacked creativity and <b>that</b> <b>Dead</b> Head Fred was the exception.|$|E

Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher said that, after living {{together}} for a while, Dead and Euronymous [...] "got on each other's nerves a lot" [...] and [...] "weren't really friends at the end". Hellhammer recalls <b>that</b> <b>Dead</b> once went outside to sleep in the woods because Euronymous was playing synth music <b>that</b> <b>Dead</b> hated.

2500|$|As {{the skin}} layers {{continually}} replaces itself, cells are pushed outward where they die and flake off. [...] For most individuals, these flakes of skin {{are too small}} to be visible. [...] However, certain conditions cause cell turnover to be unusually rapid, especially in the scalp. It is hypothesized that for people with dandruff, skin cells may mature and be shed in 2–7 days, as opposed to around a month in people without dandruff. [...] The result is <b>that</b> <b>dead</b> skin cells are shed in large, oily clumps, which appear as white or grayish flakes on the scalp, skin and clothes.|$|E

2500|$|The game's {{setting and}} {{presentation}} also received mixed opinions from critics. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed {{felt that the}} 1950s B-movie vibe was a bit overdone, and could have used [...] "just a smidgen more subtlety". Arthur Gies of IGN agreed. He felt that the game [...] "makes a good initial impression" [...] but {{that it did not}} have enough substance. GameSpot's Chris Watters felt that [...] "the campy B-movie vibe and cartoon aesthetic aren't good enough to add much appeal".

Hellhammer claimed <b>that</b> <b>Dead</b> [...] "was the first black metal musician to use corpse paint".
