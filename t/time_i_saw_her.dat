500|$|Billy Vaughn covered [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] on his 1967 Ode to Billy Joe {{instrumental}} album, as did Dean Martin on his 1970 album My Woman, My Woman, My Wife. Glen Campbell's version {{appeared on}} his 1971 album The Last <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>Her,</b> Eddy Arnold's on his 1972 album Lonely People, and George Strait's on his 1992 album Holding My Own. Steagall performed it with Reba McEntire on his 2007 Here We Go Again album, {{but she did}} not include it on her 2007 duets album , which was released four weeks later. Their collaboration was favorably reviewed, and McEntire was said to reinvigorate this country standard by Nathalie Baret of ABQ Journal. Martin's version was 3:07, and it later appeared on compilation albums, starting with the 1996 Dean Martin Gold, Vol. 2. It has appeared on a handful of other Martin compilation albums. Campbell's version was only 2:26. Strait's version is 2:53 and appears later on his 2004 Greatest Collection at a 2:55 length. Steagall's version with McEntire (who Steagall discovered at a 1974 county fair) is 3:10. R and boogie-woogie pianist and singer Little Willie Littlefield recorded a version for his 1997 album The Red One.|$|E
6000|$|Now Marina flushed {{beneath her}} brown skin, {{and for the}} first and last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> gentle eyes grow hard with anger as she answered: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought she}} was older," [...] I ventured to put in, remembering my {{impressions}} as to her age the last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> with her father.|$|E
60|$|How {{she found}} her way I cannot tell. Great pieces of her dress were torn off and {{remained}} hanging to the bushes into which she stepped; and many <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> run against a tree and recoil half stunned by the shock.|$|R
2500|$|... "The First <b>Time</b> Ever <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> <b>Her</b> Face" [...] (with The Flaming Lips) (2012) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think she}} felt pretty all-by-herselfish, too. Several <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> make a motion {{as if to}} cross over to us, but she never did it--too shy, I suppose. I wished she would come. If I hadn't felt so much like the {{aforesaid}} elephant I'd have gone to her. But I couldn't lumber across that big hall with all those boys howling on the stairs. She was the prettiest freshette <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> today, but probably favor is deceitful and even beauty is vain on your first day at Redmond," [...] concluded Priscilla with a laugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{she came}} to the city last month, and I've been to see her a number of times; the last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> she {{proposed}} to me." ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly she had changed, she had deserted {{me without}} a word of explanation, and the next <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> she was totally opposed to my {{maintaining}} any connection whatever with Sylvia.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O yes,' {{said the}} landlady, closing the door. 'The lady who was {{supposed}} to have met with such a horrible fate, and was alive all the <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> the other day.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The last <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> {{like her}} own old self, {{was the night}} when you came home, my dear. The day you went away, she said to me, [...] "I never shall see my pretty darling again. Something tells me so, that tells the truth, I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> {{driving her}} geese {{down the hill}} on the day I came to Four Winds, {{she looked at me}} with the same expression," [...] persisted Anne. [...] "I felt it, {{even in the midst of}} my admiration of her beauty. She looked at me resentfully--she did, indeed, Captain Jim." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{spring the}} first <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> for her papa and mamma [...] moved in [...] Next door, just as skating was over, and marbles about to begin; [...] For the fence in our back yard was broken, and <b>I</b> <b>saw,</b> as <b>I</b> peeped [...] through the slat, [...] There were [...] "Johnny-jump-ups" [...] all around her, and I {{knew it was}} [...] spring just by that.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, she's a good girl--a {{beautiful}} little thing. I was clean gone {{on her first}} <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> An' she was on me. Her mother lives with us--respectable girl, none o' your....' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since {{the first}} <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> {{and that was}} very soon after I came to this neighborhood. I knew as soon as she spoke to me that I would never marry any one else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How is Mary looking?" [...] said Sir Walter, in {{the height}} of his good humour. [...] "The last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> she had a red nose, but I hope that may not happen every day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, sir, I {{was frightened}} enough the first evening that I ventured on any advances, for they startled her {{enough to make}} her swoon away. I carried her from her room, and my uncle dragged me back before the colour came back to that lovely face so that the women might come to her. That was the only <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> save through the chinks of the shutters. Judge of the {{distraction}} I lived in!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This lasted twenty-six {{hours from}} the <b>time</b> when <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> {{had come and}} gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to falter. I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.|$|R
60|$|All {{eyes were}} now turned to Sorais, who stood {{with that same}} slow smile upon her {{beautiful}} face which I had noticed the first <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> She paused a little while, and cleared her throat, and then thrice she curtseyed low, once to Nyleptha, once to Curtis, and once to Good, and began to speak in measured tones.|$|R
6000|$|... "The last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> {{with that}} gown on," [...] said Mrs. Wragge, {{dropping}} {{into a chair}} and beginning to tremble, [...] "was the time when I came back from shopping and saw the Ghost." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, in her time, I had {{not reached}} the point where I stopped. The last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> I was still upstairs; and, indeed, I did not half know what I could do till I tried." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{all very}} well," [...] Norgate grumbled, [...] "but the last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> {{she was about}} three deep among the notabilities. I really don't feel that I ought to jostle dukes and ambassadors to claim a dance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean," [...] said Miss Mackinnon, {{striking}} {{her hips}} {{with the back}} of her hands smartly, and accenting each word that dropped like a bullet from her mouth with an additional blow,--"I--mean--that--your--wife--had one--of--her--old--hangers-on--from--'Frisco--here--in--this very--kitchen--all--the--arternoon; there! I mean that whiles she was waitin' here for you, she was canoodlin' and cryin' over old <b>times</b> with him! <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> myself through the winder. That's what I mean, Mr. Joshua Rylands." ...|$|R
5000|$|Roberta Williams {{collaborated with}} a team {{consisting}} mainly {{of the same people}} that worked with her on the previous two games, but more people were involved in the production this time. Al Lowe, who made the music in King's Quest II, became the lead programmer of King's Quest III, while his wife Margaret made the music instead. This was the game on which Al Lowe cut his teeth before moving onto his own series, Leisure Suit Larry. Williams said, [...] "Rosella was introduced {{toward the end of the}} game; seeing her on the screen for the first <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> suddenly <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> on her own adventures in a sequel." ...|$|R
60|$|The first <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> was one autumn {{morning as}} I rode to {{town in a}} horse-car. It was early, and my only fellow-passenger was a crusty old gentleman, who sat in a corner, reading his paper; so when the car stopped, I glanced out to see who came next, hoping {{it would be a}} pleasanter person. No one {{appeared}} for a minute, and the car stood still, while both driver and conductor looked in the same direction without a sign of impatience. I looked also, but all I could see was a little girl running across the park, as girls of twelve or thirteen seldom run nowadays, if any one can see them.|$|R
60|$|I {{was struck}} in this note with {{the mention of}} Lord Byron, and, the next <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> alluded to it, and remarked upon the {{peculiar}} qualities of his mind as shown {{in some of his}} more serious conversations with Dr. Kennedy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Umph--sickly?--no, no, {{she is not}} sickly--she is {{as healthy}} as any one in constitution--and, on my word, I think her paleness only renders her more interesting. The last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> I thought she might have rivalled one of Canova's finest statues." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not she! Last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> {{she told}} me she wouldn't go back into an office, or take on typewriting again, for {{anything}} in the world. She was looking prettier than ever, too. There's a swell chap almost crazy about her. Shouldn't wonder if she hasn't got an automobile." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There was {{the same}} {{wondering}} look in her eyes--only wilder than I had ever seen it yet--while I was speaking. When I'd done, she says in the same strange way, 'Speak out, mother; I can't hear you when you whisper like that.' She was as long saying these words, and bungled over them as much, {{as if she was}} only just learning to speak. I think I got the first suspicion then, of what had really happened. 'Mary!' I bawled out as loud as I could, 'Mary! can't you hear me?' She shook her head, and stared up at me with the frightened, bewildered look again: then seemed to get pettish and impatient all of a sudden--the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> so--and hid her face from me on the pillow.|$|R
40|$|I {{write this}} review under a darkening cloud. My friend Essie (not her real name) was {{recently}} diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the first friend in my generation. As I {{waited for the}} results of the com-prehensive assessment she underwent, I felt burdened by an almost unbearable weight that was not entirely selfless. Haunted by images of how her life would change, what would be lost to <b>her</b> as <b>time</b> passed, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> a year from now, five years from now, imagining what it might feel like as ways of being, doing, and living gradually slipped away. And <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> myself in a similar position or, at least I tried to, until I came to feel quite overwhelmed with fear and anguish. I am happy to report that Essie took the diagnosis with an equanimity that has left me in awe. Yet, perhap...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, pardner, let me {{tell you}} how I size up the princess. She's a good-hearted woman as ever lived, but she's a little off color with the women who run the church socials here. She's a rippin' good {{business}} woman, and her luck beats h--l. Why last week she bought a feller's claim in fer ten thousand dollars and yesterday they tapped a vein of eighty dollar ore, runnin' three feet wide. She don't haff to live here--she's worth a half million dollars--but she likes mining and she likes men. She knows how to handle 'em too--as you'll find out. She's hail-fellow with us all--but I tell ye she's got to like a feller all through before he sees the inside of her parlor. She's stuck on you. We're good friends--she come to call on my wife yesterday, and she talked about you pretty much the hull <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> worse bent up over a man. I believe she'd marry you, Mose, I do." ...|$|R
60|$|The next <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> she {{was opening}} {{the door of the}} house on the Prado to me, with her cap and the little black silk apron on, and with that marked {{personality}} of her own, which had been concealed so perfectly in the dowdy walking dress, very much to the fore.|$|E
6000|$|... "If she is {{as pretty}} as she was last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her,</b> she 'll get pupils fast enough. I would n't mind taking lessons myself," [...] was the gracious {{observation}} of Shaw, Jr., as he turned from the mirror, with the soothing certainty that his objectionable hair actually was growing darker.|$|E
60|$|I saw {{her only}} four times, but I {{remember}} them vividly; {{she made an}} impression upon me. I thought her very pretty and very interesting,--a charming specimen of a type. I am very sorry to hear of her death; and yet, when I think of it, why should I be sorry? The last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> she was certainly not--But I will describe all our meetings in order.|$|E
6000|$|Faith in the doctor. Perhaps that is {{the entire}} thing. It seems to look like it. In old times the King cured the king's evil by the touch of the royal hand. He {{frequently}} made extraordinary cures. Could his footman have done it? No--not in his own clothes. Disguised as the King, could he have done it? I think we may not doubt it. I think we may feel {{sure that it was}} not the King's touch that made the cure in any instance, but the patient's faith in the efficacy of a King's touch. Genuine and remarkable cures have been achieved through contact with the relics of a saint. Is it not likely that any other bones would have done as well if the substitution had been concealed from the patient? When I was a boy a farmer's wife who lived five miles from our village had great fame as a faith-doctor--that was what she called herself. Sufferers came to her from all around, and she laid her hand upon them and said, [...] "Have faith--it is all that is necessary," [...] and they went away well of their ailments. She was not a religious woman, and pretended to no occult powers. She said that the patient's faith in her did the work. Several <b>times</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> make immediate cures of severe toothaches. My mother was the patient. In Austria there is a peasant who drives a great trade in this sort of industry, and has both the high and the low for patients. He gets into prison every now and then for practising without a diploma, but his business is as brisk as ever when he gets out, for his work is unquestionably successful and keeps his reputation high. In Bavaria there is a man who performed so many great cures that he had to retire from his profession of stage-carpentering {{in order to meet the}} demand of his constantly increasing body of customers. He goes on from year to year doing his miracles, and has become very rich. He pretends to no religious helps, no supernatural aids, but thinks there is something in his make-up which inspires the confidence of his patients, and that it is this confidence which does the work, and not some mysterious power issuing from himself.|$|R
60|$|I {{drew her}} onward {{a few paces}} towards the Square. Then I stopped, remembering the body that lay face {{downwards}} on the road. The savage strength of a few moments before, had left me from the <b>time</b> when <b>I</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> now reeled where I stood, from sheer physical weakness. The sound of her pantings and shudderings, of her abject inarticulate murmurings for mercy, struck me with a supernatural terror. My fingers trembled round her arm, the perspiration dripped down my face, like rain; I caught at the railings by my side, to keep myself from falling. As I did so, she snatched her arm from my grasp, as easily as if I had been a child; and, with a cry for help, fled towards the further end of the street.|$|R
6000|$|... "I said to {{the corpse}} as I passed it, 'poor woman. I hope you are as happy as you look.'" [...] sighed Susan. [...] "She had not changed much. That dress she wore was the black satin she got for her daughter's wedding {{fourteen}} years ago. Her Aunt told her then to keep it for her funeral, but Myra laughed and said, 'I may wear it to my funeral, Aunty, but I will {{have a good time}} out of it first.' And I may say she did. Myra Murray was not a woman to attend her own funeral before she died. Many a <b>time</b> afterwards when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> enjoying herself out in company I thought to myself, 'You are a handsome woman, Myra Murray, and that dress becomes you, but it will likely be your shroud at last.' And you see my words have come true, Mrs. Marshall Elliott." ...|$|R
