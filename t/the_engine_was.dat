5|$|One {{aircraft}} was fitted with the Shvetsov M-71 for trials in 1944. However <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> {{not yet ready}} for service and the program was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> {{moved forward}} 100mm (4in) to improve {{longitudinal}} stability.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Rolls-Royce {{started work}} on modifying some Merlins which were later {{to be used}} in British MTBs, MGBs, and RAF Air-Sea Rescue Launches. For these the superchargers were {{modified}} single-stage units and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> re-engineered for use in a marine environment. Some 70 engines were converted before priority was given to producing aero engines.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same 90° 4.3 litre V8 {{as in the}} {{standard}} F430. The output remains the same at , {{as well as the}} torque at 343 lbft Nm. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> equipped with Double Overhead Camshafts and contains 4 valves per cylinder. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is,</b> and always has <b>been,</b> naturally aspirated. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> mounted behind <b>the</b> cockpit, and faces longitudinally (along the length of the car).|$|R
5000|$|Power: <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> a {{controlled}} 5.0L V8 (R302ci for the Ford Falcon and 304ci for the Holden Commodore). Most parts of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>are</b> controlled {{and unlike the}} Australian Touring Cars (Supercars Championship) which uses fuel injection, the series uses {{a controlled}} carburettor. The other control parts for <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>are</b> manifolds, exhausts, cam-shafts, rockers, air-filter/cold air box and ignition. <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> rev-limited to 6400rpm. Top speed is 240 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Manifold Pressure Gauge - Indicates the (absolute) {{pressure}} in <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> intake manifold. When <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> running normally, {{there is a}} good correlation between the intake manifold pressure and <b>the</b> torque <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> developing.|$|R
5|$|Restricted driver {{visibility}} {{due to the}} air-smoothed casing. The exhaust {{problem was}} never adequately resolved, and continued to beat down onto the air-smoothed casing when <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> on the move, obscuring the driver's vision from the cab.|$|E
5|$|Simons Wrecking Company No. 2 is a H.K. Porter, 0-6-0T {{steam engine}} built in 1941. The tank engine, which is oil fired, {{worked for the}} US Navy during World War II in Virginia as #14. Later <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> put into service with Simons Wrecking Co. as No. 2.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s and in {{the early}} 1960s, VAT and the French Camions Willème SA had plans for joint production, but only one jointly {{produced}} prototype was ever made; the chassis was from Vanaja, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> from AEC, and the cabin, which was a forward control type cabin and partly made from glass fibre, was from Willème.|$|E
50|$|Since early 2009, IKCO {{has used}} newly {{developed}} Iranian engines {{such as a}} dual-fuel national engine for its new models (EF7).In mid-2010, IKCO started to install petrol-only EF7 <b>engines</b> on Samand. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> not a petrol-based version of EF7 but the compressed natural gas (CNG) parts of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>are</b> removed and also <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> control unit (ECU) program. However, the petrol-based version of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> currently under development.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Alpina <b>engine</b> code <b>is</b> {{still unknown}} but <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> codenamed N63M30 by BMW.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} <b>the</b> Volkswagen {{air-cooled}} <b>engine.</b> It <b>is</b> extensively modified for aircraft use {{and all the}} parts <b>are</b> custom made. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> derived from <b>the</b> certified <b>engines</b> produced by <b>the</b> same manufacturer and used in several motorgliders and light aircraft.|$|R
5|$|Development {{began in}} November 1994 by the lead programmer, Simon Carter, and took {{two and a}} half years to develop. The game used the engine for Magic Carpet, and the first version was merely {{scrolling}} around a map and entering third-person. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> built by Glenn Corpes. Molyneux then developed a 2D prototype containing features that made it into the final game. The prototype focused on constructing the dungeon, and included the Treasure room, Hatchery, Training room, and Dungeon Heart. The characters were designed by the artist, Mark Healey.|$|E
5|$|In January 2006, Flying Scotsman duly {{entered the}} National Railway Museum's {{workshops}} {{for a major}} overhaul to return it to Gresley's original specification and to renew its boiler certificate. It was initially estimated that this would only take one year, and cost around £750,000. The bay in which the locomotive was being refurbished was on view to visitors to the NRM but <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> rapidly dismantled {{to such an extent}} that the running plate was the only component recognisable to the casual observer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Rolls-Royce started {{planning}} its future aero-engine development programme and realised {{there was a}} need for an engine larger than their 21-litre (1,296cu in) Kestrel which was being used with great success in a number of 1930s aircraft. Consequently, work was started on a new -class design known as the PV-12, with PV standing for Private Venture, 12-cylinder, as the company received no government funding for work on the project. The PV-12 was first run on 15 October 1933 and first flew in a Hawker Hart biplane (serial number K3036) on 21 February 1935. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> originally designed to use the evaporative cooling system then in vogue. This proved unreliable and when ethylene glycol from the U.S. became available, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> adapted to use a conventional liquid-cooling system. The Hart was subsequently delivered to Rolls-Royce where, as a Merlin testbed, it completed over 100 hours of flying with the Merlin C and E engines.|$|E
5000|$|... 0-4-0F #1 {{was built}} for Delaware Power & Light by H.K. Porter in 1950. <b>The</b> <b>Engine</b> <b>is</b> a fireless cooker, meaning it is a {{locomotive}} without a firebox. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> currently stored in Marshallton.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> also unusually compact for a V8. According to TVR, {{the total}} weight of <b>the</b> {{finished}} <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> 121 kg.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>engines</b> <b>were</b> {{featured}} in both Titanic films, [...] "A Night To Remember" [...] (1958) and the made-for-TV film [...] "S.O.S. Titanic" [...] (1979). <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> {{very similar to}} <b>the</b> actual <b>engines</b> on board <b>the</b> Titanic albeit <b>the</b> Titanic's <b>engines</b> <b>were</b> 4 cylinders as opposed to three. Yet <b>the</b> Kempton <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> correct size (4 stories tall) and of the correct type (triple expansion). Alas, land based pumping engines, Like Kempton Park's engines have flywheels: Marine Steam Engines have no flywheels.|$|R
5|$|On 1 September 1922, A Farman F.60 Goliath on {{a flight}} from Croydon Airport to Paris, {{suffered}} a severely damaged propeller after flying through torrential rain whilst crossing the English Channel. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> shut down and a precautionary landing was made at Saint-Inglevert where the propeller was changed in 15 minutes. The aircraft then departed for Le Bourget, where arrival was only 12 minutes later than scheduled.|$|E
5|$|The Astrid {{raised its}} anchor at around 11:00 on 24 July 2013, and left Oysterhaven on motor power. She {{was one of}} 50 vessels {{participating}} in Ireland's 2013 Gathering Cruise between Oysterhaven and Kinsale. At around 11:35 her sails were being raised while <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> still in use, and the ship was sailing towards the south-west at around 3 knots. At around 11:40, the ship's engine failed.|$|E
5|$|The {{contamination}} caused what {{is known}} as a hard alpha inclusion, where a contaminant particle in a metal alloy causes the metal around it to become brittle. The brittle titanium around the impurity then cracked during forging and fell out during final machining, leaving a cavity with microscopic cracks at the edges. For the next 18 years, the cracks all grew slightly each time <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> powered up and brought to operating temperature and finally broke open, causing the disk to fail.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{checkers}} <b>engine</b> can <b>be</b> {{used with}} the CheckerBoard GUI. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> available as freeware.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} <b>the</b> Wasserboxer. It is {{extensively}} modified for aircraft use {{and all the}} parts <b>are</b> custom made. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> derived from <b>the</b> certified <b>engines</b> produced by <b>the</b> same manufacturer and used in several motorgliders and light aircraft.|$|R
50|$|In a turbofan, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> {{started when}} {{compressed}} air is blown through its high-pressure stages. In a turboprop, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> started by <b>the</b> starter-generator, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> own electric generator - during the start, an electric current runs through it, making it spin, and then making <b>the</b> whole <b>engine</b> turn. In both cases, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> must <b>be</b> already spinning before igniting the fuel, {{so as to}} have the compressors attain enough speed to draw air and make it flow though <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> When there <b>is</b> a sufficient amount of air flowing, the fuel is injected, and then <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> will <b>be</b> able to run by itself.|$|R
5|$|The {{electric}} motor {{was equipped with}} several hundred feet of cable carried on a reel. The cable attached to a specially designed electrical outlet box that was nearest to the fire. The box would be located next to the water plugs throughout the city districts in the manner previously mentioned. When <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> tested, it gave very good results, {{and is now in}} use at the factory of the Crocker-Wheeler Electric Company, in Ampere, New Jersey. The company claimed that an electric fire engine of the same capacity as a steam fire engine would be more efficient.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> {{mounted on}} two main support frames that were {{supported}} by two tubular struts. The frame structure was triangulated and emanated from the fuselage. The main frames were bolted onto the power plant in its top quarter. In turn, the frames were attached to the firewall by universal joints. The firewall itself was constructed from asbestos mesh with dural sheets on both sides. All conduits passing through had to be arranged so that no harmful gases could penetrate the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|The {{pilot and}} gunner/radio {{operator}} sat in tandem, {{back to back}} in a single pressurized cockpit, protected by armour plates to their front and rear, {{as well as by}} a bulletproof windscreen, seated on ejection seats. The aircraft was intended to use Klimov VK-1 engines, a derivative of the Rolls-Royce Nene II, but <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> still under development, so less powerful Kuznetsov RD-45s were substituted instead. The aircraft carried a Toryii-1 radar for use by the gunner/radio operator.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> a twin {{cylinder}} four-stroke, horizontally-opposed, , air-cooled, gasoline engine design, with a mechanical gearbox spur gear reduction drive with a reduction ratio of 2.5:1. It employs electronic ignition and produces [...] continuous at 5750 rpm. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> management system <b>is</b> a six-sensor computer and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> optimized {{to drive a}} 68 to 70 in propeller.|$|R
40|$|A {{variable}} cycle jet <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> {{provided with}} a mixing duct assembly which mixes core engine exhaust gas with bypass air when <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> operating in a turbofan mode and which blocks flow from <b>the</b> core <b>engine</b> and isolates <b>the</b> core <b>engine</b> from <b>the</b> bypass flow when <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> operating as a ramjet...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> of an {{inverted}} vertical triple-expansion type, 62 ft tall from basement {{to the top}} of the valve casings and each weighing over 800 tons. <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> <b>are</b> thought to be the biggest ever built in the UK.|$|R
5|$|A {{specialist}} {{was hired}} to enhance the game's artificial intelligence and give enemies more lifelike behaviour. In previous Tomb Raider games, enemies would simply run at Lara and attack immediately, whereas in Tomb Raider III, enemies can pop {{out of the dark}} and attack the player, or retreat back into the level and regroup to attack later. A stealth element partially inspired by Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007 was also introduced, giving players the option of sneaking around and avoid detection. New vehicles that are critical to complete certain levels were added; the team also experimented with the idea of putting Lara on horseback, but they ultimately discarded it. The development of the game took eleven months to complete, and incorporating all the new ideas into <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> considered the most difficult task of the project.|$|E
5|$|After {{the storm}} {{moved into the}} western Atlantic, the Miami U.S. Weather Bureau issued storm {{warnings}} for the North Carolina coastline from Wilmington to Cape Hatteras; the region was warned to prepare for strong winds. The agency also issued a small craft advisory southward through Charleston, South Carolina. Offshore, the storm produced winds of up to 85mph (140km/h), as well as waves up to 35feet (10m) in height. The combination of the winds and rough waves drove a freighter ashore along Portsmouth Island in the Outer Banks, after <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> damaged when water entered the fuel line. The 26person crew initially planned to evacuate, but they later decided {{to stay on the}} freighter as the U.S. Coast Guard were deployed to assist. The seas damaged a portion of the ship, but the entire crew was rescued without any injuries. The storm later brushed New England, bringing rain, fog, warmer temperatures, and gusty winds. The combination resulted in downed power poles and tree limbs, leaving 10,000houses without electricity.|$|E
5|$|After version 1.0 {{had been}} finished, the engine's code name White Engine {{was changed to}} the {{official}} title Crystal Tools. This was not only done to represent {{the company and its}} works better, but also due to the refractive effects of real-life crystals that were meant to symbolize the flexibility of the engine. Over the next few months, the programmers advanced the engine to version 1.1 and added preliminary support for the Wii. In September 2011, Final Fantasy Versus XIII director Tetsuya Nomura announced that his team had replaced Crystal Tools with a proprietary action game engine that was supplemented by the lighting technology of the company's new Luminous Studio engine. Other teams, such as the staff behind Final Fantasy XIII-2, kept using and refining Crystal Tools. For , <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>was</b> adjusted to make it more suitable to games with an open world design.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} <b>the</b> Volkswagen {{air-cooled}} <b>engine</b> or <b>the</b> Wasserboxer. It is extensively modified for aircraft use {{and all the}} parts <b>are</b> custom made. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>is</b> derived from <b>the</b> certified <b>engines</b> produced by <b>the</b> same manufacturer and used in several motorgliders and small aircraft.|$|R
