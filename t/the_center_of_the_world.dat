5|$|The Final Fantasy Legend {{operates}} on a turn-based system {{similar to that}} of Final Fantasy II. The game's characters battle monsters and fiends using a variety of weapons, armor, and skills that develop through the player's actions. The game follows the story of four heroes who attempt to scale a tower at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> that supposedly leads to paradise. The four heroes may belong to one of three character classes, each housing a unique customization path.|$|E
5|$|View of the World from 9th Avenue (sometimes A Parochial New Yorker's View of the World, A New Yorker's View of the World {{or simply}} View of the World) is a 1976 {{illustration}} by Saul Steinberg {{that served as}} the cover of the March 29, 1976, edition of The New Yorker.

50|$|<b>The</b> lines joining <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{circles in}} Fig. 2 are {{perpendicular}} to the line segments AP, BQ and CR. For example, <b>the</b> line joining <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle containing ARB and <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circle containing AQC, is {{perpendicular to the}} segment AP. So, <b>the</b> lines joining <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circles also intersect at 60° angles. Therefore <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circles form an equilateral triangle. This is known as Napoleon's Theorem.|$|R

25|$|Unger looks {{closely at}} existential {{projects}} that fail: the heroic ethic (delusional about historic setting, which negates the ethic), and the impersonal absolute ethic (Buddhism, which tries but cannot divest itself of the world). Both {{respond to the}} fact of the individual not being <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> However, by doing so they disengage from the world and others. While Confucianism addresses interdependence, the philosophy elevates it to a level of canonical hierarchy and thus imposes strict constraints.|$|E
25|$|Unger {{sees the}} Christian-Romantic {{tradition}} {{as the one}} tradition that puts the individual at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and gives him the tools for the liberation of self and environment. However, similar to the world's religious and philosophical traditions, it fails to provide a lasting answer to the predicament of human existence. This failure is the constant danger that after liberation the self will return to its customary affairs and routine practices. Rather than moving onwards to greater feats of humanity and godlike existence, the individual will allow everyday affairs to again take over. This surrender to habit is directly linked to {{the defeat of the}} imagination. Thus metaphysical revolution is needed through a psychology of empowerment and an analysis of social conditions upon which this empowerment relies. Unger’s project begins here.|$|E

25|$|In his Divina commedia ("Divine comedy"; set in {{the year}} 1300), Dante Alighieri {{employed}} the concept of taking Virgil as his guide through Inferno (and then, in the second canticle, up the mountain of Purgatorio). Virgil himself is not condemned to Hell proper in Dante's poem but is rather, as a virtuous pagan, confined to Limbo just {{at the edge of}} Hell. The geography of Hell is very elaborately laid out in this work, with nine concentric rings leading deeper into the Earth and deeper into the various punishments of Hell, until, at <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> Dante finds Satan himself trapped in the frozen lake of Cocytus. A small tunnel leads past Satan and out {{to the other side of}} the world, at the base of the Mount of Purgatory.|$|E
25|$|The Catholicon – On {{the east}} side {{opposite}} the Rotunda is the Crusader structure housing the main altar of the Church, today the Greek Orthodox catholicon.

Since 1996 this dome is topped by the monumental Golgotha Crucifix which the Greek Patriarch Diodoros I of Jerusalem consecrated. It was at the initiative of Gustav Kühnel to erect a new crucifix at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem that would not only be worthy of the singularity of the site, but that would also become a symbol of the efforts of unity in the community of Christian faith.|$|E
500|$|Early in {{the sixteenth}} century Nicolaus Copernicus {{drastically}} reformed the model of astronomy by displacing the Earth from its central place in favour of the Sun, yet he called his great work De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres). Although Copernicus does not treat the physical nature of the spheres in detail, his few allusions make it clear that, like many of his predecessors, he accepted non-solid celestial spheres. Copernicus rejected the ninth and tenth spheres, placed the orb of the Moon around the Earth and moved the Sun from its orb to <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> [...] The planetary orbs circled <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> in the order Mercury, Venus, the great orb containing the Earth and the orb of the Moon, then the orbs of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

500|$|Reviewers {{suggested}} that the film draws upon many existing religious and mythological motifs. [...] Vern Barnet of the Charlotte Observer opined that Avatar poses a great question of faith—should the creation be seen and governed hierarchically, from above, or ecologically, through mutual interdependence?

500|$|His first {{leading role}} {{was in the}} 2001 feature <b>The</b> <b>Center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World,</b> where he plays Richard Longman, a lonely young {{entrepreneur}} who skips out on his company's big initial public offering and pays a stripper (Molly Parker) $10,000 to fly to Las Vegas with him. The film received average reviews, however, A.O. Scott of the New York Times, reported that the performances by both Sarsgaard and Parker [...] "provide a rough grain of authenticity, capturing the blunted affect and aimless neediness of people in their 20s struggling to navigate a world of material abundance and impoverished emotional possibility." [...] Scott concluded in his recap that Sarsgaard made his character [...] "seem like a genuinely nice guy, too innocent to grasp the sleaziness of his bargain with Florence." ...|$|E

[...] Kaeli is ambushed and poisoned in the process, and her mother informs Benjamin of the Elixir and where it can be found. [...] Benjamin's search for Elixir to heal Kaeli brings him to Bone Dungeon, where he's aided by a treasure hunter named Tristam in succeeding dual purposes: not only does Benjamin get Elixir from Tristam to heal Kaeli, but he defeats one of the four Vile Evils, Flamerous Rex, to free the Crystal of Earth and in turn restore life to the dying village of Foresta.
