40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{construction}} {{technique used}} to manufacture an RF cavity {{is critical in}} terms of cost, construction time, ease of construction and reliability {{in the design of}} a synchrotron radiation source. Three techniques have previously been used by Daresbury. The SRS storage ring cavities used forged components, fitted on a mandrel and electroformed together]. The present booster synchrotron cavity components were e-b welded while the spare was vacuum brazed [1]. Before deciding on any construction technique for the future UK Light Source DIAMOND, complete construction by an electroforming process, and sputtering copper onto an aluminium former are being assessed. II. DIAMOND Cavity The preliminary design for the future 3 rd generation light source DIAMOND has a 500 MHz cavity without nose cones to give good HOM characteristics [2] [4] [5]. Multipoint temperature sensors will help to control the <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cavity</b> <b>body</b> to better than 0. 05 C. Tuning...|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} a surgically {{implanted}} improvised explosive device (SIIED) {{is derived from the}} <b>Body</b> <b>Cavity</b> Bomb (BCB) concept enunciated by Dr. Robert J.

5000|$|Lipomas are tumors {{that occur}} within the fatty tissues and reside as soft, fluctant round masses that adhere tightly to {{surrounding}} tissue (typically to organs and the membrane linings <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>cavities).</b> For {{this type of}} tumor, surgical removal is the common treatment choice. However, removal is not guaranteed as the tumor sometimes adheres strongly to surrounding muscles and tissues.|$|R
50|$|A <b>body</b> <b>cavity</b> search, {{also known}} simply as a cavity search, is either a visual search or a manual {{internal}} inspection <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>cavities</b> for prohibited materials (contraband), such as illegal drugs, money, jewelry, or weapons. <b>Body</b> <b>cavities</b> used for concealment include nostrils, ears, mouth, navel, penis (urethra and foreskin) or vagina, and rectum. It is far more invasive than the standard strip search that is typically performed on individuals taken into custody, either upon police arrest or incarceration at a jail, prison, or psychiatric hospital. Often the procedure is repeated when the person leaves the institution.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Most {{cytology}} laboratories in all Gulf countries including Oman, use {{the standard}} papanicolaou (PAP) method to stain various cytological specimens. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the possible application of ultrafast PAP (UF-PAP) method in cytology laboratory. Materials and Methods: Samples from 46 patients containing 26 body fluids and 20 fine needle aspirations (FNAs) (9 thyroids and 11 breasts) were collected. Two air dried and two wet smears from each sample were prepared and stained by UF-PAP and the standard PAP stains, respectively. Background, nuclear staining, cell morphology, and overall staining were independently reviewed by two cytoscreeners. Results: In all cases of FNA, UF-PAP stain gave a good score for the background, nuclear staining, cell morphology, and overall staining when compared with the standard PAP method. Although the correct diagnosis was made in all cases <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>cavity</b> fluids cases except in one case, UF-PAP stain gave a fewer score in the assessment <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>cavity</b> fluid samples. Conclusion: The findings of this study support the use of UF-PAP method in cytology laboratory with a high emphasis on FNA samples...|$|R
40|$|Human {{herpesvirus}} 8 (HHV- 8) associated primary effusion lymphomas arise {{and grow}} in the <b>body</b> <b>cavities</b> as effusions, {{but it is not}} known whether the lining <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>cavities</b> and mesothelium derived malignancies are potential targets of HHV- 8 infection. We examined a series of 13 diffuse malignant mesotheliomas and four mesothelial cell rich effusion samples of non-neoplastic aetiology from non-immunodepressed patients using the polymerase chain reaction to detect HHV- 8 specific sequences. HHV- 8 amplification products were absent in diffuse malignant mesotheliomas and in non-neoplastic effusions samples. These results suggest that HHV- 8 has a selective tropism among <b>body</b> <b>cavity</b> based tumours, being confined to primary effusion lymphomas...|$|R
5000|$|Nematosomes arise by budding {{from the}} cnidoglandular tract of the mesenteries in N. vectensis; thus, {{they are of}} {{ectodermal}} origin. Although material can be seen circulating in the gastrovascular cavity from the onset <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>cavity</b> development, true nematosomes do not appear until approximately {{the same time that}} the polyp reaches sexual maturity. Inspection of the jelly matrix surrounding a spawned egg mass will reveal abundant nematosomes; male anemones do not appear to release nematosomes during spawning. Once outside the <b>body</b> <b>cavity,</b> nematosomes can live from one to several days in dilute seawater, dependent upon the temperature at which they are housed.|$|R

50|$|The wound must be {{of a type}} {{which can}} benefit from the {{application}} of maggot therapy. A moist, exudating wound with sufficient oxygen supply is a prerequisite. Not all wound-types are suitable: wounds which are dry, or open wounds <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>cavities</b> do not provide a good environment for maggots to feed. In some cases {{it may be possible}} to make a dry wound suitable for larval therapy by moistening it with saline soaks, applied for 48 hours.|$|R
40|$|The {{radiological}} {{manifestations of}} the aberrant air surrounding the pleura are varied because of the air outlining the organs {{in and out of}} the visceral space. The continuity of the visceral space from the neck, mediastinum to the retroperitoneum is originated from embryological development, which is compatible with the findings through laboratory experiments, cadaveric anatomy, and thoracic computer tomography image. We reviewed the embryo development to understand the anatomy <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>cavity,</b> which can determine the radiological findings of pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax...|$|R
50|$|Items can be {{concealed}} {{in a number}} <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>cavities.</b> For example, objects may be concealed by inserting them into the rectum. Illegal drugs can be placed in condoms and temporarily stored in the colon. Cylinders such as cigar tubes are used to hide money, intravenous syringes, and knives.

50|$|A {{mesentery}} is a membrane {{inside the}} <b>body</b> <b>cavity</b> <b>of</b> an animal. The term identifies different structures in different phyla: in vertebrates it {{is a double}} fold of the peritoneum enclosing the intestines; in other organisms it forms complete or incomplete partitions <b>of</b> the <b>body</b> <b>cavity,</b> whether that is the coelom or, as in the Anthozoa, the gastrovascular cavity.|$|R
50|$|In physiology, {{the term}} serous fluid or serosal fluid (originating from the Medieval Latin word serosus, from Latin serum) {{is used for}} various bodily fluids that are {{typically}} pale yellow and transparent and of a benign nature. The fluid fills the inside <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>cavities.</b> Serous fluid originates from serous glands, with secretions enriched with proteins and water. Serous fluid may also originate from mixed glands, which contain both mucous and serous cells. A common trait of serous fluids is their role in assisting digestion, excretion, and respiration.|$|R
50|$|The {{urogenital}} opening {{is where}} bodily waste and reproductive fluids are expelled {{to the environment}} outside <b>of</b> the <b>body</b> <b>cavity.</b> In some organisms, including birds and many fish, discharge from the urological, digestive, and reproductive systems empty into a common sac called the cloaca.|$|R

50|$|In older {{dogs and}} cats tumors are a common occurrence, and may involve any or {{multiple}} body systems: skin, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal tract, urogentital tract, reproductive tract, cardiovascular system, spinal cord and peripheral nerves, the spleen and the lining <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>cavities.</b> Common skin tumors include lipomas, mast cell tumors, melanomas, squamous cell carcinomas, basal cell carcinomas, fibrosarcomas, and histiocytomas. Skin tumors are removed through either simple excisions or through excisions needing reconstructive plastic surgery. Common oral tumors include melanomas, fibrosarcomas, squamous cell carcinomas, which are removed with as much surrounding tissue as possible, including parts of the mandible and maxilla. Other types of cancer requiring surgery include osteosarcoma, stomach and intestinal tumors, splenic masses, and urinary bladder tumors.|$|R
