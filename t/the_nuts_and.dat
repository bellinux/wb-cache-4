25|$|Therefore, for {{the first}} metamaterial, <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> bolts are one split-ring {{resonator}} electromagnetically combined with one (electric) conducting post. These are designed to resonate at designated frequencies to achieve the desired values. Looking at the make-up of the split ring, the associated magnetic field pattern from the SRR is dipolar. This dipolar behavior is notable because this means it mimics nature's atom, but on a much larger scale, such as in this case at 2.5 millimeters. Atoms exist {{on the scale of}} picometers.|$|E

Nuts and flowers are eaten by the wild turkey and several species of songbirds. Nuts and bark are eaten by black bears, foxes, rabbits, and raccoons. Small mammals eat <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> leaves; 5 to 10 percent of the diet of eastern chipmunks is hickory nuts. White-tailed deer occasionally browse hickory leaves, twigs, and nuts.|$|E
25|$|The {{specifications}} of the Army Technical Bureau {{were given}} to the 4th Military Laboratory of the Okubo District. The team started their design and worked hard to complete the project within the two years allocated. The team had to design everything from the ground up, including <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> bots to be used. The tank design was completed in May 1926 and production was ordered to begin at the Osaka Army Arsenal. At the time, there was little heavy industry allocated to the production of motor vehicles in Japan, so there were significant difficulties creating the prototype. The prototype was completed by February 1927, within the required period and ready for field trials.|$|E

25|$|During {{his studies}} on the Galápagos Islands, Charles Darwin {{observed}} 13 species of finches that are closely related and differ most markedly {{in the shape of}} their beaks. The beak of each species is suited to the food available in its particular environment, suggesting that beak shapes evolved by natural selection. Large beaks were found on the islands where the primary source of food for the finches are nuts and therefore the large beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for opening <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> staying well nourished. Slender beaks were found on the finches which found insects to be the best source of food on the island they inhabited; their slender beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for pulling out the insects from their tiny hiding places. The finch is also found on the mainland and it is thought that they migrated to the islands and began adapting to their environment through natural selection.|$|E

Eventually, he called series creator Chris Carter and expressed his desire to write an episode of Millennium instead. Carter agreed, but once more, King {{changed his mind and}} it was decided that he would write an episode of The X-Files. King sent various drafts to Carter from his home in Maine; the two individuals never actually met one another. King's original story had some issues that Carter rewrote. Carter explained, [...] "Stephen wasn't used to writing for Mulder and Scully [...] the Mulder-and-Scully story in his original draft didn't quite work". Carter separated Mulder and Scully in the finalized draft and helped to finalize the script, hence their dual writing credit on the episode. Kim Manners, the director for the episode, later said, [...] "I was very excited to be able to direct a Stephen King piece, and when it was all said and done, there was very little Stephen King left in it. <b>The</b> <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> bolts were his, but that was really one of Chris' scripts."

[...] Todd Gilchrist of IGN Entertainment expressed hope in the further development of the series, noting the complex backgrounds of each character as being the series' focal point. He noted that the ensemble, composed of [...] "countless comely females and enough strong, competitive males" [...] remains outstanding in prime time, being iconic, due to the vast interpretations regarding the main cast. Whereas Gilchrist acknowledged that the show gives the impression of it being only for women, he stated that he can attest to its universal, equal-opportunity appeal, assessing that the show [...] "explores the medical world with both a sense of testosterone-fueled intensity and estrogen-laced sensitivity" [...] and deserved to have viewers from both genders, championing its merits. In response to the bomb story arc, he called the two episodes [...] "juicy", while assessing that they [...] "followed a story line that not only explained the series up to that point, but featured all of the characters in their more or less purest from". Gilchrist provided an outlook on each character, describing Grey as a [...] "prodigiously talented but insecure surgeon, waylaid by her love for attending Derek Shepherd", while stating that Yang, [...] "an aggressively ambitious intern" [...] lacks knowledge on any topic, except medicine, comparing her to boyfriend Burke, described as her opposite. In response to George O'Malley's story line, he noted how his sensitive personality constantly results in difficulty in his path to becoming a proper surgeon. He also expressed excitement in the doors opened by the previous season's cliffhanger, seeing the arrival of Montgomery (Walsh) as [...] "certainly speaking to the show's focus on relationships over <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> bolts of being a surgeon", while praising Rhimes for continuing to [...] "merge those disparate elements in the way that does, or at least should be a source of enthusiasm for both men and women, creating an atmosphere both professional and intimately personal, often at the same time".|$|E
