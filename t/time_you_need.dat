Therefore, at this time, just criticising biofuel may not be a good solution. I would urge we need to address these issues in a comprehensive manner." [...] Regarding Jean Ziegler's proposal for a five-year ban, the U.N. Secretary rejected that proposal.|$|E

The second invariant is the "width" which corresponds, in the simple pole case, to the maximal integral difference between to eigenvalues of b^- 1. a (the logarithm of the monodromy).|$|R
