40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} characterise through {{elemental}} analysis some unusual gold glass <b>tesserae</b> {{said to have}} been found at a Roman villa site in Southwick, West Sussex. The site is no longer accessible, being underneath a Methodist chapel, but it has been excavated, to some extent, on several occasions. Glass <b>tesserae</b> are not common in a British setting but they are by no means unusual in Roman mosaics. Gold glass <b>tesserae,</b> however, in which gold leaf is sandwiched between two layers of glass, are very unusual: fewer than twenty such <b>tesserae</b> are known from Roman Britain and the seven examples from Southwick make up the largest single group. However, the provenance of these Southwick <b>tesserae</b> remains doubtful and so they were analysed and compared to gold glass <b>tesserae</b> from Roman London to try and establish whether they are compositionally related to typical Roman glass. For comparative reasons, the handful of coloured glass <b>tesserae</b> from Southwick were also analysed. Our results suggest that the <b>tesserae</b> said to be from Southwick are anomalous in relation to the other material and cannot be assigned to the Roman period...|$|R
30|$|White colored mosaics {{presented}} {{higher levels}} of Ca, P and in a minor extent, Mn. The major element was calcium as expected, because white mosaic <b>tesserae</b> were manufactured by a calcite-based matrix, {{as shown in the}} results obtained by Raman spectroscopy. Thus, elemental measurements corroborate the previous results. Moreover, unlike black <b>tesserae,</b> white ones do not present any of the previously mentioned elements related with volcanic origin in significantly high levels. Instead of them, white <b>tesserae</b> together with the orange ones, presented the highest level of P and Mn among all the analyzed <b>tesserae.</b> However, the intensity of the Kα line of P and Mn was very low in all the cases. The case of Cl in red <b>tesserae</b> was exactly the same as the previous one.|$|R

This produced a golden reflection emanating from in between the <b>tesserae</b> as well as their front, causing a far richer and more luminous effect than even plain gold leaf would create.|$|R

In fact, there is only few works [12, 25, 26] in which the chemical composition of some <b>tesserae</b> from Pompeian mosaics had been analyzed. Therefore, the available information about the materials used to manufacture the <b>tesserae</b> that were used to create the final Pompeian mosaics is few. Moreover, to manufacture colored <b>tesserae</b> it is supposed that pigments were used. For this reason it is interesting to analyze both the substrate matrix and the pictorial layer of the <b>tesserae.</b> These identifications could help to understand more about the custom procedures and materials used to manufacture Pompeian mosaics.|$|R

The old flint foundations that had been revealed; the houses with porches and corridors and courtyards and pillared hypocausts; the winter room with its wide beautiful floor--red and black and white and grey and yellow, with geometric pattern and twist and scroll and flower and leaf and quaint figures of man and beast and bird--all to be covered up with earth so that the plough may be driven over it again, and the wheat grow and ripen again as it has grown and ripened there above the dead city for so many centuries. The very earth within those walls had a reddish cast owing to the innumerable fragments of red tile and <b>tessera</b> mixed with it. Larks and finches were busily searching for seeds in the reddish-brown soil.

There has not before appeared a race like that of civilized Europe at this day, thoughtfully unproductive of all art--ambitious--industrious--investigative--reflective, and incapable. Disdained by the savage, or scattered by the soldier, dishonored by the voluptuary, or forbidden by the fanatic, the arts have not, till now, been extinguished by analysis and paralyzed by protection. Our lecturers, learned in history, exhibit the descents of excellence from school to school, and clear from doubt the pedigrees of powers which they cannot re-establish, and of virtues no more to be revived: the scholar is early acquainted with every department of the Impossible, and expresses in proper terms his sense of the deficiencies of Titian and the errors of Michael Angelo: the metaphysician weaves from field to field his analogies of gossamer, which shake and glitter fairly in the sun, but must be torn asunder by the first plow that passes: geometry measures out, by line and rule, the light which is to illustrate heroism, and the shadow which should veil distress; and anatomy counts muscles, and systematizes motion, in the wrestling of Genius with its angel. Nor is ingenuity wanting--nor patience; apprehension was never more ready, nor execution more exact--yet nothing is of us, or in us, accomplished;--the treasures of our wealth and will are spent in vain--our cares are as clouds without water--our creations fruitless and perishable; the succeeding Age will trample [...] "sopra lor vanita che par persona," [...] and point wonderingly back to the strange colorless <b>tessera</b> in the mosaic of human mind.|$|E

5000|$|Apart from roundels with figurative images the fused {{sandwich}} {{technique was}} used to create the <b>tesserae</b> for gold in mosaics, and for beads and the like. Gold glass <b>tesserae,</b> at least by Byzantine times, had a very thin top layer of glass, which was probably poured onto the lower glass with the gold leaf glued to it. <b>Tesserae</b> were made in blocks or [...] "cakes" [...] and then cut into cubes, which are relatively large {{in the case of}} gold backgrounds. Gold backgrounds were laid over earth red or yellow ochre backgrounds which enhanced their visual effect. Most colours of <b>tesserae</b> seem to have been made locally to the mosaic, but there is some discussion as to whether this was true for gold glass ones. In the 11th century the relatively new Christian centre of Kiev seems to have used gold <b>tesserae</b> made in Constantinople.|$|R
30|$|As stated previously, white, {{orange and}} red <b>tesserae</b> {{are placed in}} the same part of the PC 1. This is {{probably}} due to the common calcite-based matrix.

40|$|Microfossils {{recovered}} from chalk <b>tesserae</b> in mosaics from the Roman town Calleva Atrebatum, modern Silchester, southern England, {{are used to}} suggest a provenance for the source-rock. The microfossils include foraminifera characteristic of late Cretaceous (Campanian) foraminiferal biozone BGS 20 (quadrata macrofaunal biozone) and subzone BGS 21 i (basal mucronata macrofaunal biozone). Calcareous nannofossil assemblages from the same <b>tesserae</b> are poorly preserved, preventing precise age determination, but confirm an age of Santonian to Campanian. As indurated chalk beds of this age are not present in the chalks of southern England, {{it is probable that}} calcretized chalk, formed by secondary calcification beneath Palaeogene rock cover, was used to manufacture the <b>tesserae.</b> This suggestion is supported by a comparative analysis of chalk <b>tesserae</b> from the Norden Roman site in Dorset. Although the provenance of the chalk in some of the Silchester <b>tesserae</b> can be placed only within a broad geographical area of downland in southern England, others apparently originated in the Dorchester-Swanage-Portsdown area, some 100 km to the Wilkinson et al., 13 th March, 2008 1 southwest of Silchester.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the origin, supply pattern and {{production}} technology of Byzantine glass mosaic <b>tesserae.</b> In this study, we have analysed forty-eight glass <b>tesserae</b> from Sagalassos (Asia Minor) of different colours and from two archaeological contexts that were stratigraphically dated to the sixth century CE. The main aim was to identify the raw materials, colourants and opacifiers as well as secondary working practices that are reflected in the composition (EPMA, LA-ICP-MS analyses) and the microstructure (XRD, SEM-BSE) of the <b>tesserae.</b> The set of samples retrieved from the Roman Baths complex at Sagalassos is compositionally very homogeneous, representing possibly a single commission, and can be tentatively dated to the late Roman period. In contrast, the assemblage associated with the construction of a Byzantine church {{around the turn of the}} sixth century CE is more diverse, suggesting that these <b>tesserae</b> were produced from more than one silica source. This highlights a diversification in the supply and manufacture of glass <b>tesserae</b> during the Byzantine period. Although all analysed samples are natron-type soda-lime-silica glasses, a strong correlation between MgO, K 2 O, P 2 O 5 and CaO was observed, pointing to the contamination of the glass batch through fuel ash either intentionally in case of the red <b>tesserae</b> or accidentally as regards the green, peacock and white samples. The degree of contamination reflects differences in the duration of the secondary production stage according to the colour, which is also evidenced by the shapes and sizes of the opacifying crystals present in the opaque <b>tesserae.</b> X-ray diffraction measurements identified calcium antimonate (in the blue, peacock and white <b>tesserae)</b> and lead antimonate (green and yellow) as the main opacifying agents. The morphological analysis suggests that the calcium antimonate particles crystallised in situ, whereas a lead antimonate pigment was synthesised prior to its addition to the glass melt. Taken together, the compositional and microstructural characteristics clearly demonstrate different production processes that are related to the colours of the <b>tesserae,</b> thus indicating colour-specific secondary workshop practice...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} the archaeometric {{characterisation}} of 38 glass <b>tesserae</b> of various colours from an in situ mosaic in Aquileia, Italy, dated to {{the second half of}} the fourth century AD. The examination of the textural, mineralogical and chemical features, conducted by means of a multi-methodological approach (optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), electron probe micro analysis (EPMA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fibre Optic Reflectance Spectrophotometer (FORS)), has provided valuable insights into the changes in the production technology during the transition between the Roman and the Late Antique periods. The assemblage is heterogeneous, and each chromatic group is composed of <b>tesserae</b> produced with different base glasses and colouring/opacifying techniques, suggesting diverse supplies. A small group of <b>tesserae</b> shows strict links to the Roman tradition in terms of both base glass and colouring/ opacifying techniques and was probably obtained by re-using <b>tesserae</b> from older mosaics. Conversely, a larger group of <b>tesserae</b> shows textural and chemical evidence of recycling and indicates the prompt use of Bnew^ opacifying technologies (such as the use of tin compounds) or uncommon technological solutions (such as the use of quartz and bubbles as opacifiers or the addition of metallurgical slags in red <b>tesserae),</b> suggesting a specific production in the fourth century AD...|$|R
