25|$|The road {{began in}} the Forum Romanum, passed through the Servian Wall at the porta Capena, went through a cutting in the clivus Martis, and left the city. For this stretch of the road, the {{builders}} used the via Latina. The building of the Aurelian Wall centuries later required the placing of another gate, the Porta Appia. Outside of Rome the new via Appia went through well-to-do suburbs along the via Norba, the ancient track to the Alban hills, where Norba was situated. The road {{at the time was}} a via glarea, a gravel road. The Romans built a high-quality road, with layers of cemented stone over a layer of small stones, cambered, drainage ditches on either side, low retaining walls on sunken portions, and dirt pathways for sidewalks. The via Appia {{is believed to have been}} the first Roman road to feature the use of lime cement. The materials were volcanic rock. The surface was said to have been so smooth <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> distinguish the joints. The Roman section still exists and is lined with monuments of all periods, although the cement has eroded out of the joints, leaving a very rough surface.|$|E

You ought to go, to see how happy the human race can be. It is a fine, rich valley, about thirty miles from Port Platte; heavily timbered with mahogany all round; well watered; flowers so beautiful; fruits in abundance, so delicious <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> refrain from stopping to eat, till you could eat no more. My sons have laid out good roads, and built bridges and mills; the people are improving, and everything is prosperous.|$|E

500|$|On July 22, 2007, in an {{interview}} with The Hollywood Reporter, MacFarlane announced that he may start working on a feature film, although [...] "nothing's official."

[...] He came up with an idea for the story, [...] "something <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> do on the show, which [...] is the only reason to do a movie." [...] He later went to say he imagines the film to be [...] "an old-style musical with dialogue" [...] similar to The Sound of Music, saying that he would [...] "really be trying to capture, musically, that feel." [...] On October 13, 2011, Seth MacFarlane confirmed that a deal for a Family Guy film had been made, {{and that it would be}} written by himself and series co-producer Ricky Blitt.|$|E
500|$|Marshall later conceded that, [...] "I {{had never}} heard of atomic fission but I did know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> build much of a plant, much less four of them for $90million." [...] A single TNT plant that Nichols had {{recently}} built in Pennsylvania had cost $128million. Nor were they impressed with estimates to the nearest order of magnitude, which Groves compared with telling a caterer to prepare for between ten and a thousand guests. A survey team from Stone & Webster had already scouted a site for the production plants. The War Production Board recommended sites around Knoxville, Tennessee, an isolated area where the Tennessee Valley Authority could supply ample electric power and the rivers could provide cooling water for the reactors. After examining several sites, the survey team selected one near Elza, Tennessee. Conant advised that it be acquired at once and Styer agreed but Marshall temporized, awaiting the results of Conant's reactor experiments before taking action. Of the prospective processes, only Lawrence's electromagnetic separation appeared sufficiently advanced for construction to commence.|$|E

500|$|Eisenhower privately disparaged Bricker's motives, {{suggesting}} Bricker's {{push for}} the Amendment was driven by [...] "his one hope of achieving at least a faint immortality in American history," [...] and considered the Amendment entirely unnecessary, telling Stephen Ambrose it was [...] "an addition to the Constitution <b>that</b> said <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> violate the Constitution." ...|$|R
500|$|New York Daily News critic Jack Matthews {{believed}} the film lacked tension, and went more for cheap shocks—focusing more on enhancing the [...] "imagery of violence"—than real attempts {{to scare the}} audience; he gave the film {{one and a half}} stars out of five. Dennis Harvey, from Variety magazine, echoed Matthew's opinion that the film failed to deliver on the suspense; he also felt <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> tell one teenage character from the next, whereas in Carpenter's original each teenager had real personalities. In contrast, Rossiter Drake of The Examiner applauded Michael's backstory, feeling that it was a [...] "compelling take on the mythology" [...] that managed to be [...] "unique" [...] and [...] "shocking" [...] at the same time. In agreement with other critics, Empire magazine's Kim Newman felt that, because Zombie seemed less focused on the teenagers being stalked and killed by Michael, the film [...] " [...] flat" [...] when it came to delivering suspense or anything [...] "remotely scary"; Newman did praise McDowell for his portrayal of the [...] "dogged psychiatrist". Ben Walter, of Time Out London, felt Zombie added [...] "surprising realism" [...] to the development of Michael Myers’ psychopathic actions, but agreed with Newman that the director replaced the original film’s [...] "suspense and playfulness" [...] with a convincing display of [...] "black-blooded brutality".|$|E
2500|$|When Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, who worshiped {{and taught}} Islamic studies at Dar Al-Hijrah, {{for which he}} also was a camp counselor, was charged by U.S. {{prosecutors}} with plotting with members of al-Qaeda to assassinate President George W. Bush, Abdul-Malik said in February 2005: [...] "Our whole community is under siege. They don't see this as a case of criminality. They see it as a civil rights case. As a frontal attack on their community." [...] He added: [...] "The feeling I get here on a daily basis must be {{what it was like to}} be a member of Martin Luther King Jr.'s church following the case of Rosa Parks. People always ask, 'What is the latest from the courthouse?'" [...] Abdul-Malik accused the government of singling out Abu Ali to stir anti-Muslim sentiment. Abu Ali was convicted in 2005 of providing material support to the al-Qaeda terrorist network, and conspiracy to assassinate President Bush, and is serving a life sentence. [...] When in April 2005 Ali al-Timimi of Fairfax, Virginia, an American-born Muslim cleric, was convicted of inciting followers to wage war against the US just days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and of recruiting for the Pakistani terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the paintball terrorist cell, Abdul-Malik said: [...] "There is a view many Muslims have when they come to America <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be arrested for something you say. But now they have discovered they are not free to speak their minds. And if our opinions are out of vogue in the current climate, we feel we are all at risk."
