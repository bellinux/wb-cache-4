5000|$|Vermeer is {{represented}} as a dark spindly figure in a kneeling position. The figure’s outstretched leg serves as a <b>table</b> <b>top</b> <b>surface,</b> on which sits a bottle and a small glass. This leg tapers to a baluster-like stub; there is a shoe nearby. The walls and the distant views of the mountains are based on real views near Dalí's home in Port Lligat. [...] In Vermeer's painting the artist leans on a maulstick, and his hand is painted with an unusual blurriness, perhaps to indicate movement. In Dalí's painting Vermeer rests the same arm on a crutch.|$|E

Also discussed is recent innovations with regards to distinguishing multi touch from single touch technology. I explore the requirements needed to build a multi touch <b>table</b> <b>top</b> <b>surface,</b> and describe {{the process of building}} one. I then describe my proposed method of visualizing tree-structured data and how it can be implemented using Core Animation technology. I also propose a means of interacting with the data through a multi touch interface, and discuss which gestures can be used to navigate the visualization display...|$|E
40|$|We {{envision}} a nomadic model of interaction where {{the personal computer}} fits in your pocket. Such a computer is extremely limited in screen space. A technique is described for “spilling ” the display of a hand held computer onto a much larger <b>table</b> <b>top</b> display <b>surface.</b> Because our model of nomadic computing frequently {{involves the use of}} untrusted display services we restrict interactive input to the hand held. Navigation techniques such as scrolling or turning the display can be expressed through the <b>table</b> <b>top.</b> The orientation and position of the hand held on the <b>table</b> <b>top</b> is detected using three conductive feet that appear to the touch table like three finger touches. An algorithm is given for detecting the three touch positions from the table’s sensing mechanism. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>table</b> <b>top</b> and rim clamps {{hold and}} rotate {{the wheel to}} mount or {{dismount}} a tire. The <b>table</b> <b>top</b> is directly above the foot pedals and below the mount/demount mechanism. The <b>table</b> <b>top</b> is able to rotate clockwise and counter clockwise. The <b>table</b> <b>top</b> is shaped as the letter [...] "X", {{but it can be}} a circle in different tire changer models. On each end of the <b>table</b> <b>top,</b> there are pneumatic-powered rim clamps. These rim clamps move in unison to secure wheels onto the <b>table</b> <b>top.</b> Each rim clamp can be adjusted closer or further away {{from the center of the}} <b>table</b> <b>top</b> to accommodate smaller or larger wheels.|$|R
50|$|The {{tire changer}} has two foot pedals. The left pedal {{is called the}} clamp control pedal, a three {{position}} pedal that opens and closes the rim clamps. Once pressed, pneumatic pistons move the 4 rim clamps together or apart simultaneously. The right pedal is the <b>table</b> <b>top</b> pedal, which is a three position pedal that controls {{the rotation of the}} <b>table</b> <b>top.</b> When the <b>table</b> <b>top</b> pedal is pressed down, the <b>table</b> <b>top</b> spins clockwise. The <b>table</b> <b>top</b> spins counter clockwise when the pedal is raised.|$|R
