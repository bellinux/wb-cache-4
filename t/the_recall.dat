5|$|During the {{petition}} drive, groups supporting Morse accused the firm collecting the signatures of hiring convicted felons and gathering personal information. Recall backers said that Morse's group was misleading the public. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> drives brought in support from national groups {{on both sides}} of the issue. The National Rifle Association (NRA) supported <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> effort with mailers and donations. National groups opposing <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> included America Votes, believed to be financially supported by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as California billionaire Eli Broad.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{donations}} {{were also}} an issue. Bloomberg and Broad donated $350,000 and $250,000, respectively, {{to support the}} Senators. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee also spent $250,000 to oppose recall. The NRA spent over $108,000 to support <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> efforts. In total, the Morse and Giron side spent approximately $3,000,000 opposing <b>the</b> <b>recall,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> supporters spent about $500,000.|$|E

5|$|According to Quirky, Wink {{products}} were in 300,000 homes by 2015. In April 2015 Wink experienced a security problem that made {{many of its}} hubs go offline or break, forcing the company to issue a recall. <b>The</b> <b>recall</b> caused a several-month inventory backlog and subsequent shortage of the Wink hub. Due to financial difficulties, {{due in part to}} <b>the</b> <b>recall,</b> Quirky began looking for buyers to sell Wink to in 2015. That November, after Quirky went through bankruptcy proceedings, it sold Wink for $15 million to Flextronics (now called Flex), to whom Quirky owed $18.7 million. Flex was Wink's primary supplier of firmware and hardware. Wink continues to operate as an independent subsidiary of Flex. As of 2016, 1.3 million devices are connected to Wink.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Hebbian hetero-associative {{learning}} is inherently asymmetric. Storing a forward association from pattern A to pattern B enables <b>the</b> <b>recalling</b> of pattern B given pattern A. This, in general, {{does not allow}} <b>the</b> <b>recalling</b> of pattern A given pattern B. The forward association between A and B will tend to be stronger than the backward association between B and A. In this paper it is described how the dynamical associative model proposed in [10] can be extended to create a bi-directional associative memory where forward association between A and B is equal to backward association between B and A. This implies that storing a forward association, from pattern A to pattern B, would enable <b>the</b> <b>recalling</b> of pattern B given pattern A and <b>the</b> <b>recalling</b> of pattern A given pattern B. We give some formal results that support {{the functioning of the}} proposal, and provide some examples were the proposal finds application. ...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{deadline}} of June 5, the final number of signatures was never determined because the petitions were sent {{out of state}} to avoid a subpoena from the Sauk County district attorney, an ardent McCarthy supporter who was investigating the leaders of <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> campaign {{on the grounds that}} they had violated Wisconsin's Corrupt Practices Act.

5|$|Giron and Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz {{claimed that}} <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> defeat {{was due to}} voter {{suppression}}. The Denver Post disputed this, saying that the result wasn't caused by voter suppression {{but the fact that}} more people showed up to vote against Giron than to vote for her. Gessler said that the Democrats fared worse where more people turned out. Wasserman Schultz also stated that the money spent by the NRA and the Koch brothers made it impossible for Democrats to win.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> {{of the state}} militia, the mine owners closed the mines. Bowers arrested Calderwood, 18 other miners, and the mayor and town marshal of Altman (who had supported the miners). They were taken to Colorado Springs and quickly tried on several different charges, but found not guilty. Meanwhile, outbursts of violence, such as stone-throwing and fights between union miners and scabs, increased in frequency. Stores and warehouses were broken into, and guns and ammunition stolen.|$|E

5|$|On September 17, 1992, Apple {{recalled}} 60,000 PowerBook100s {{because of}} a potential safety problem.

On the day of <b>the</b> <b>recall,</b> Apple shares closed at $47, down $1.25, but some analysts discounted the recall's importance. In addition, the original power supplies had problems with insulation cracks that could cause a short in a fuse on the motherboard; and the computer was prone to cracks in the power adapter socket on the motherboard, which required a $400 replacement motherboard if the warranty had expired.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{election}} date was set as September 10, national organizations {{on both sides}} of the gun-control debate started to weigh in. On <b>the</b> <b>recall,</b> pro-gun rights side was the National Rifle Association and Americans for Prosperity, while on the gun control side was the Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Mayor Bloomberg. Morse went door-to-door in an effort to gain voter support and both sides of the campaigns accused the other side of mud-slinging. Morse supporters were upset about an ad alleging ethical misconduct by Morse, noting that he had been cleared of those allegations. Giron supporters were accused of misrepresenting the issue as a choice on women's rights and abortion.|$|E
40|$|Between January and April 2009, a {{foodborne}} illness outbreak linked to Salmonella resulted {{in one of}} the largest food safety <b>recalls</b> ever in <b>the</b> United States.

Although consumer purchases of peanut-containing products initially slowed as the scope of <b>the</b> <b>recalls</b> spread, retail purchases returned to normal within several months and the total volume of peanuts processed during the 2008 / 09 (August-July) marketing year increased slightly from that of the previous year.

Unlike the Double Supreme, the new Big King lacked the interior bread piece the Big Mac had, and the advertising used to promote the Big King continued to utilize the 75% more beef claim. However, the new sandwich was introduced while the company was dealing with a highly publicized beef recall from one of its key suppliers, Hudson Foods, and had to deal with accusations that the introduction was designed to distract the public and media from <b>the</b> <b>recall.</b> The sandwich was initially introduced in the United States at a 99¢ (USD) price point, which helped propel sales to nearly twice the estimated volume and causing many locations to sell out of the burger patties used to produce the sandwich.|$|E
5|$|From 1971 onwards, Harvey was the {{chairman}} of selectors. It was a tumultuous period in Australian cricket, where captain Bill Lawry was acrimoniously sacked {{in the middle of the}} 1970–71 series against England after a dispute between players and Australian officials. Lawry was not informed of his fate and learned of his omission on the radio when he was still one of Australia's most productive batsmen. The dispute was the genesis of the pay dispute which, led to the formation of World Series Cricket in 1977 and generated a mass exodus of players. This resulted in <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> of Bob Simpson after ten years in retirement at the age of 41 to captain the Test team. Following the rapprochement between the establishment and the WSC players, Harvey left the selection panel. The WSC representatives felt that Harvey's anti-WSC comments made him prejudiced against the selection of former WSC players.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> curious free <b>recall</b> data of Murdock (1962) {{shows an}} {{additional}} surprise {{that seems to}} have gone undetected until now: the probability of guessing an item in <b>the</b> initial <b>recall</b> is not identical to <b>the</b> overall free <b>recall</b> curve. Initial recall of an item is well correlated with <b>the</b> total <b>recall</b> of that item using a straight line but with an unexpected offset. The offset varies with the presentation rate and the total number of list items but in each case it is the same as <b>the</b> total <b>recall</b> probability of <b>the</b> least <b>recalled</b> item. Thus for the initial “freest” of <b>recalls</b> <b>the</b> location of the least remembered item is identified, in effect identifying the context, and from there <b>the</b> items <b>recalled</b> are those better remembered items, in proportion to the probability of total <b>recall.</b> Within <b>the</b> tagging/retagging model (Tarnow, 2008, 2009) <b>the</b> free <b>recall</b> starts by an identification of a discontinuity in the activity level and produces an item with a probability according to the relative activity level.
