Rio's public transportation service has been a target of many critics and the motive of the 2013's protests and manifestations that started in São Paulo and spread through the entire country.

40|$|Los Angeles is {{well known}} {{around the world as}} an automobile-oriented low density community, yet recent <b>transportation</b> <b>policies</b> have {{emphasized}} greater capital investment in rail transportation than in highways, and recent policies have attempted to discourage automobile usage through transportation demand management. While these policies have accomplished small shifts toward public transport and somewhat lower dependence upon singly occupied automobiles for work commuting, the financial costs of these policy changes has been very large in relation to their benefits. Proper pricing of transportation alternatives, more creative use of new and emerging transportation technologies, and the provision of many more opportunities for simpler private sector transport services, would all appear to be more promising as cost-effective approaches to coping with congestion in Los Angeles than the current regional <b>transportation</b> <b>policies...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{state of}} Connecticut {{has taken a}} {{proactive}} approach to preserving railway right-of-ways. Since the 1970s, Connecticut Department of <b>Transportation</b> <b>policy</b> has been to acquire abandoned rail lines for preservation. This {{has contributed to the}} majority of railroad mileage in Connecticut to be publicly owned, between the state and Amtrak. Today, this policy continues; the State will purchase any RoW that shows future potential for transportation, when the property becomes available. CDOT has subsequently transferred 60 miles of RoW to the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection for use in rail trails, and CDEEP itself has independently obtained another 50 miles (22 of which are used for the Valley Railroad). A provision of this transfer is that CDOT is allowed to retake ownership of a right-of-way when needed for transportation purposes. Because of this, Connecticut is one of the only states where railbanked corridors have a reasonable chance of reactivation (should there be a need to), where elsewhere local opposition from trail users and property abutters would be able to directly influence a municipally-owned right-of-way.|$|E
