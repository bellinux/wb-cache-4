5|$|NASA's Kepler spacecraft, {{which was}} {{launched}} in March 2009, collected photometric data continuously over a four-month period in a small area of sky, using a 0.95m Schmidt telescope. When <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>collected</b> during this period was analyzed, 1235 planetary candidates were identified amongst the observed 150,000 stars; all of these planetary candidates were suspected of transiting their host stars, in which the planetary body periodically crosses in front of and slightly dims its host star. Because <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>collected</b> on the transits of KOI-98 (later known as Kepler-14b) seemed very clearly to indicate a planet, Kepler identified KOI-98 early on in its mission. Data on the object of interest was forwarded to the Kepler Follow-up Program for a follow-up investigation.|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park has {{a highly}} {{regarded}} global climate change research program. Based in West Glacier, with the main headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, the U.S. Geological Survey has performed scientific research on specific climate change studies since 1992. In addition {{to the study of}} the retreating glaciers, research performed includes forest modeling studies in which fire ecology and habitat alterations are analyzed. Additionally, changes in alpine vegetation patterns are documented, watershed studies in which stream flow rates and temperatures are recorded frequently at fixed gauging stations, and atmospheric research in which UV-B radiation, ozone and other atmospheric gases are analyzed over time. The research compiled contributes to a broader understanding of climate changes in the park. <b>The</b> <b>data</b> <b>collected,</b> when compared to other facilities scattered around the world, help to correlate these climatic changes on a global scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Typhoon Vera can be ascertained {{back to a}} diffuse area of low {{pressure}} first incorporated into surface weather analysis early on September20. At the time, the disturbance was situated between Guam and Chuuk State. Though the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) did not classify the incipient system as a tropical cyclone, the Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA) analyzed the disturbance to be a tropical depression as early as 0000UTC that day. Initially, the depression tracked westward, but transiently shifted to a more northerly course on September21. Late that day, a reconnaissance airplane dispatched by the JTWC to analyze the disturbance failed to reach its center due to engine failure. However, <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>collected</b> from the storm's periphery was sufficient enough for the warning center to classify the depression as a tropical storm at 1800UTC that day. Despite the flight data, the JMA had already determined the system to have been of at least tropical storm intensity six hours earlier. As a result of the reclassification, the tropical storm was designated the name Vera by the JTWC. At this point the tropical cyclone began to take a more westerly course.|$|E

25|$|In {{educational}} psychology, {{qualitative research}} {{is used to}} address questions concerned with developing {{an understanding of the}} meaning and collecting nonnumerical relevant data to gain insights into particular phenomenon. The central to good qualitative research is whether the research participants’ subjective meanings, actions and social contexts, as understood by them, are illuminated. Qualitative logic are for examining patterns across people. It is widely used in educational psychology. Educational psychologists only infrequently drew on qualitative literatures in the past 11 years to design their research studies. It does appear, however, that there has been {{an increase in the number}} of educational psychologists publishing studies using qualitative design frameworks in the past 5 years. On the other hand, it has its weakness as well. Qualitative formats for representing knowledge, such as text, afford insights into a learner’s understanding but are difficult to assemble into summary formats that concisely show a learner’s progress or allow comparisons among learners or across groups. The most fundamental and significant distinction between quantitative research method and qualitative research method is about the data, how <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>collected</b> and analyzed. Therefore, this article would be focus on the research methods and how <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>collected</b> and analyzed by researchers in qualitative research.|$|E
