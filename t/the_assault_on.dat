The 22nd took part in <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> June 18, 1864. Again the regiment was deployed as skirmishers {{in front of their}} brigade. They were ordered to take a ravine alongside the Norfolk Railroad. Advancing at a run in the face of heavy canister fire, the 22nd reached the ravine. However, in that position they were subjected to severe musket and artillery fire from the Confederates, and so they pushed forward to the Norfolk Railroad cut, forcing the Confederates back to their entrenchments. In <b>the</b> <b>assault</b> <b>on</b> Petersburg, the 22nd lost seven killed and 14 wounded.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{were well}} aware that {{breaking}} the blockade was {{very important for the}} Soviet side.
