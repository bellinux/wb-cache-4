5|$|A {{railroad}} link to JFK Airport {{had been}} proposed since 1968 {{as part of}} the Program for Action, but was not actually implemented for almost three decades. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, various plans surfaced to try to build such a link. Meanwhile, the JFK Express subway service and shuttle buses provided an unpopular <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> to and around JFK. There were 21 failed proposals for rail links to New York City airports during this time. Serious planning for a dedicated <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> at JFK began in 1990. An environmental impact statement for a JFK light-rail system was released in 1997, and the current people-mover system started construction a year later. AirTrain JFK opened on December 17, 2003, despite being the subject of several lawsuits during construction and a death during one of the system's test runs.|$|E

This mutant will be important in examining the repression regulatory and sugar transport mechanisms in yeast...|$|R

40|$|Periplasmic binding protein-dependent <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> {{mediate the}} {{accumulation}} of many diverse substrates in prokaryotic cells. Similar <b>transport</b> <b>systems,</b> including the P-glycoprotein responsible for multidrug resistance in human tumors, are also found in eukaryotes. The mechanism by which energy is coupled to {{the accumulation of}} substrate by these <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> has been controversial. In this paper we demonstrate that ATP hydrolysis occurs in vivo concomitantly with transport. These data strongly suggest that ATP hydrolysis directly energizes substrate accumulation by these <b>transport</b> <b>systems.</b> The apparent stoichiometry is one to two molecules of ATP hydrolyzed per molecule of substrate transported...|$|R

5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules {{from the body of}} the cell {{to the ends of the}} axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's <b>transport</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

An important application of SH-reagents to label transport proteins using various SH-reagents modified with fluorescent- or spin-label moieties will be discussed. Two general models are shown which have been proposed to explain the role of sulfhydryl groups in some membrane <b>transport</b> <b>systems.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Biofuels have {{a limited}} ability to replace fossil fuels {{and should not be}} {{regarded}} as a ‘silver bullet’ to deal with transport emissions. Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a sustainable <b>transport</b> <b>system</b> and so must be developed as part of an integrated approach, which promotes other renewable energy options and energy efficiency, as well as reducing the overall energy demand and need for transport. Consideration needs to be given to the development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, public transport, and better town and rural planning.|$|E

30|$|Improving energy {{efficiency}} {{is an important}} goal for all <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> worldwide, particularly urban <b>transport</b> <b>systems,</b> given the forecasted rise in urbanisation and car ownership [1, 2]. Urban areas currently contain approximately 50  % of the global population, {{which is expected to}} rise to 70  % by 2050, leading to a tripling of the travel-km in urban areas [3]. Therefore, it is vital that urban <b>transport</b> <b>systems</b> adapt their entire operations to address these challenges and prevent negative economic, social and environmental consequences.|$|R
