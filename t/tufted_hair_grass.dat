50|$|The site is coppiced ancient {{woodland}} on boulder clay. It has diverse tree species, including {{wych elm}} and hornbeam, {{resulting in a}} rich ground flora. Dog's mercury is dominant {{over most of the}} woodland floor, with plants such as angelica sylvestris and <b>tufted</b> <b>hair</b> <b>grass</b> in wetter areas.|$|E
50|$|The ground flora of the {{understorey}} varies {{dependent upon}} whether the woodland is grazed by sheep. A dense shrub layer which {{is dominated by}} holly and rowan occurs in the ungrazed areas. Grazed areas are more open. Herb layers consists of bramble, bracken, softgrass and <b>tufted</b> <b>hair</b> <b>grass.</b> wood sorrel and bluebell are locally abundant.|$|E
50|$|The {{park was}} part of the grounds of an {{eighteenth-century}} mansion called Warren House. In 1937 it was acquired by Middlesex County Council and Harrow Urban District Council as public open space. It was later owned by the Greater London Council and transferred to the London Borough of Harrow in 1976. The presence of wild service trees and mature hornbeam shows that part of it is ancient woodland. The main plants in grassland areas are common bent and Yorkshire fog, with <b>tufted</b> <b>hair</b> <b>grass</b> in damp areas.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the finest}} areas of marshy {{grassland}} in Hertfordshire. It is at its best in late spring when it is carpetted with orchids. Blagrove Common {{is one of the}} few remaining areas of unimproved marshy grassland on poorly drained boulder clay. It is bisected by a stream and varies in wetness from marshy grassland to dry neutral grassland. The marshy areas are dominated by rushes and <b>tufted</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>grass.</b> Amongst these large numbers of early marsh, southern marsh and common spotted orchids and a variety of their hybrids can be found. The grasslands have been maintained for several centuries by grazing. This form of management ensures that some species, such as orchids, survive instead of allowing the more vigorous grasses to out compete all other species. Traditional grazing on wet areas also produces muddy, trampled areas which are an important micro-habitat for some plants and invertebrates. The drier areas of the common support meadow fox tail grasses, common cat's ear and common sorrel among many other species. Winter Blagrove is alot quiter in the winter months but management work continues, primarily focusing on cutting and raking the dominant rush growth. Flocks of tits can be seen around the edge of the common, with the odd goldcrest or treecreeper amongst them. Kestrels often hunt over the common, perching on the overhead wires and searching the ground for voles and mice, which are common on the reserve. Buzzards can be heard and seen gliding over distant woodland togther with red kites. Summe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tufted</b> <b>hair</b> folliculitis. <b>Tufted</b> <b>hair</b> folliculitis is an {{uncommon}} phenomenon, associated with scarring alopecia in which tufts of hair {{emerge from a}} single follicular opening.

We believe that tuft-ed hair folliculitis is a secondary phenomenon to oth-er causes of scarring alopecia. A 46 -year-old male patient presented with an 8 -year's history of recurrent bouts of burning pain and oozing lesions on his oc-cipital scalp, at times accompanied by tender occipi-tal adenopathy.

50|$|Wooded {{areas of}} Billsmoor Park support alder (Alnus glutinosa) with some hazel (Corylus avellana) on lower lying wet soils, and an {{undergrowth}} of soft rush (Juncus effusus), <b>tufted</b> <b>hair</b> <b>grass</b> (Deschampsia cespitosa), wood-sedge (Carex sylvatica), greater-tussock sedge (C. paniculata) and pendulous sedge (C. pendula). Birch is found on steeper {{sections of the}} valley. Above the woodlands, open areas of the site support bracken and occasional birch, with grassland composed of mat grass (Nardus stricta), sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina), sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum) and common bent (Agrostis capillaris). In very wet areas of the site, mire vegetation arises, including bog myrtle (Myrica gale), broad-leaved cottongrass (Eriophorum latifolium), grass-of-Parnassus (Parnassia palustris) and purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) and, around springs, yellow pimpernel (Lysimachia nemorum), bugle (Ajuga reptans) and water mint (Mentha aquatica).|$|E
50|$|The Achanalt {{reservoir}} and marshes {{were designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest on 18 May 1989 {{as the area}} is an important nesting ground. It is 214.6 ha. in size. The marshes are characterised by mesotrophic grassland on a river valley flood plain. There are two waterlogged Carex Juncus communities that include bottle sedge, marsh pennywort, and bogbean. In a relatively drier area, short grass and sedge occur, mainly in winter. The marshes are sedge dominated, and these include common sedge, carnation sedge, flea sedge, and star sedge. Tawny sedge and dioecious sedge occur in flush line areas. The featured herbs include heath spotted orchid and common valerian. Purple moor grass and <b>tufted</b> <b>hair</b> <b>grass</b> are locally extensive. Four nationally rare species of breeding birds are located here.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND:A 47 -year-old woman {{presented}} with erythematous lesions with papules and pustules on her parieto-occipital region {{that had been}} present for 8 months. Areas of sclero-atrophic alopecia were evident, whereas at different points <b>tufted</b> <b>hair</b> shafts were coming out from single dilatated follicular ostia. Before our observation, an antibiotic oral therapy with tetracyclines and local with erythromycin had been administered to the patient, with partial improvement and relapse on its suspension. METHODS: Bacterial culture from pustules showed the development of Staphylococcus aureus. A skin biopsy was done. According to clinical and histopathological findings a diagnosis of <b>tufted</b> <b>hair</b> folliculitis was made and a treatment with oral rifampicin was started at the dosage of 450 mg twice per day. RESULTS: After 3 weeks of therapy, the pustular lesions regressed completely and after a follow-up of 1 year no relapse was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Rifampicin {{is one of the}} best active antibiotics against S. aureus, which seems to play a role in the pathogenesis of <b>tufted</b> <b>hair</b> folliculitis. Our results, if further confirmed, may suggest a role for rifampicin either for the control of the pustular phase of this rare disorder or to prevent its relapses for a long time...|$|R
