50|$|A {{test probe}} is a {{physical}} device used to connect electronic test equipment to a device under test (DUT). Test probes range from very simple, robust devices to complex probes that are sophisticated, expensive, and fragile. Specific types include test prods, oscilloscope probes and current probes. A test probe is often supplied as a test lead, which includes the probe, cable and <b>terminating</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|E
50|$|As HDLC {{can operate}} {{successfully}} in quite poor (errored) data environments, DPNSS will work over a 2 Mbit/s link running without proper synchronisation (plesiochronously) and over poor quality connections (including badly <b>terminated</b> <b>connectors).</b> When setting up PBXs {{to run a}} DPNSS connection one end must {{be defined as the}} primary or 'A' end. This is a protocol requirement and {{has nothing to do with}} link synchronisation. However, such badly synchronised links were frowned upon because of the problems associated with sending faxes and/or other modem based communication which were not specifically identified within the protocol.|$|R

50|$|The {{individually}} sheathed {{construction has}} the advantage that individually cores can easily be <b>terminated</b> to individual <b>connectors</b> {{at the ends of}} the cable. Its disadvantage is that the size and weight of the cable are increased. When a cable without individual sheaths has to be <b>terminated</b> to multiple <b>connectors,</b> it is common practice to create individual sheaths using heat-shrinkable tubing.|$|R
5000|$|Microphone or [...] "signal" [...] cable used {{in setting}} up PA and {{recording}} studios is usually shielded twisted pair cable, <b>terminated</b> in XLR <b>connectors.</b> The twisted pair carries the signal in a balanced audio configuration.|$|R
25|$|Fibers are <b>terminated</b> in <b>connectors</b> {{that hold}} the fiber end {{precisely}} and securely. A fiber-optic connector is basically a rigid cylindrical barrel surrounded by a sleeve that holds the barrel in its mating socket. The mating mechanism can be push and click, turn and latch (bayonet mount), or screw-in (threaded). The barrel is typically free to move within the sleeve, and may have a key that prevents the barrel and fiber from rotating as the connectors are mated.|$|R
50|$|All-analog airchains {{typically}} use cables <b>terminated</b> in XLR <b>connectors</b> {{between each}} device. All-digital airchains also often use XLR connectors, except carrying AES/EBU digital audio instead. Alternatively, some digital airchains have significant portions of audio carried over TCP/IP, {{in which case}} Ethernet is used.|$|R
50|$|The ends of coaxial cables usually <b>terminate</b> with <b>{{connectors}}.</b> Coaxial connectors {{are designed}} to maintain a coaxial form across the connection and have the same impedance as the attached cable. Connectors are usually plated with high-conductivity metals such as silver or tarnish-resistant gold. Due to the skin effect, the RF signal is only carried by the plating at higher frequencies and does not penetrate to the connector body. Silver however tarnishes quickly and the silver sulfide that is produced is poorly conductive, degrading connector performance, making silver a poor choice for this application.|$|R
5000|$|Consumer {{electronics}} {{devices such}} as digital cameras, camcorders, and portable DVD players use 3.5 mm connectors for composite video and audio output. Typically, a TRS connection is used for mono unbalanced audio plus video, and a TRRS connection for stereo unbalanced audio plus video. Cables designed for this use are often <b>terminated</b> with RCA <b>connectors</b> on the other end.|$|R
2500|$|A {{multimeter}} can use {{many different}} test probes {{to connect to}} the circuit or device under test. Crocodile clips, retractable hook clips, and pointed probes are the three most common types. Tweezer probes are used for closely spaced test points, as for instance surface-mount devices. The connectors are attached to flexible, well insulated leads <b>terminated</b> with <b>connectors</b> appropriate for the meter. Probes are connected to portable meters typically by shrouded or recessed banana jacks, while benchtop meters may use banana jacks or BNC connectors. 2mm plugs and binding posts have also been used at times, but are less commonly used today. [...] Indeed, safety ratings now require shrouded banana jacks.|$|R
50|$|An {{optical fiber}} <b>connector</b> <b>terminates</b> {{the end of}} an optical fiber, and enables quicker {{connection}} and disconnection than splicing. The connectors mechanically couple and align the cores of fibers so light can pass. Better connectors lose very little light due to reflection or misalignment of the fibers. In all, about 100 fiber optic connectors have been introduced to the market.|$|R
50|$|The {{connector}} {{starts as}} {{a continuation of}} Duck Hole Road at an interchange with I-95 in Madison. The road crosses over I-95 about 190 yd from when it begins. The connector parallels the Hammonasset River for its entire length. The <b>connector</b> <b>terminates</b> at an intersection with U.S. Route 1 in Madison, and the road continues into Hammonasset State Park beyond US 1 as a local road.|$|R
50|$|When used to {{terminate}} cables, in some applications {{both ends of}} the cable are <b>terminated</b> using identical <b>connectors</b> (generally male), as in registered jack telephone cables or Ethernet over twisted pair network cables, while in other applications the two ends are terminated differently, either with male and female of the same connector (as in an extension cord), which ends can be connected to each other in a loop, or with incompatible connectors, in an adapter cable.|$|R
5000|$|Aviom is a pro audio {{equipment}} manufacturer of personal monitoring systems. Headquartered in West Chester, Pennsylvania, Aviom produces distributed audio networking gear {{which uses a}} proprietary digital audio transport system called A-Net, based on the physical layer of Ethernet and carried over Category 5 cables <b>terminated</b> with 8P8C <b>connectors.</b> Aviom's Pro16 Monitor Mixing System was nominated in 2005 for a TEC Award, and in 2008 the Pro64 Series won the best Sound System Technology at Musik Messe in Frankfurt, Germany.|$|R
50|$|When a {{cable is}} <b>terminated</b> by a <b>connector,</b> the various wires {{in the cable}} are {{connected}} to contacts (pins) in the connector. The most common methods of connecting pins to individual wires are soldering, insulation displacement, insulation piercing, screw clamping, axial screw termination, cage clamping, crimping, press-in termination, and wire wrapping. Some of these wiring methods can be accomplished without specialized tools. Other methods, while requiring a special tool, can assemble connectors to a cable much faster and more reliably, and make repairs easier.|$|R
5000|$|... 10BASE2 (also {{known as}} cheapernet, thin Ethernet, thinnet, and thinwire) is {{a variant of}} Ethernet that uses thin coaxial cable, <b>terminated</b> with BNC <b>connectors.</b> During {{the mid to late}} 1980s this was the {{dominant}} 10 Mbit/s Ethernet standard, but due to the immense demand for high speed networking, the low cost of Category 5 Ethernet cable, and the popularity of 802.11 wireless networks, both 10BASE2 and 10BASE5 have become increasingly obsolete, though devices still exist in some locations. As of 2011, IEEE 802.3 has deprecated this standard for new installations.|$|R
50|$|State Route 5 Connector (SR 5 Conn.) is a {{connecting}} route the partially exists in Kennesaw. It {{starts at the}} intersection of Barrett Parkway and US 41/SR 3 in Kennesaw, less than 1 mi northwest of where the SR 5 main line crosses the same two highways. SR 5 Conn. heads northeast, locally known as Ernest W. Barrett Parkway on both sides of that intersection, and crosses Interstate 75 (I-75) just before passing by Town Center Mall. The <b>connector</b> <b>terminates</b> just east of its interchange with I-575/SR 5, where the roadway continues east as Piedmont Road.|$|R
50|$|This {{de facto}} {{mechanical}} standard for CAN could be implemented with the node having {{both male and}} female 9-pin D-sub connectors electrically wired to each other in parallel within the node. Bus power is fed to a node's male connector and the bus draws power from the node's female connector. This follows the electrical engineering convention that power sources are <b>terminated</b> at female <b>connectors.</b> Adoption of this standard avoids the need to fabricate custom splitters to connect two sets of bus wires to a single D connector at each node. Such nonstandard (custom) wire harnesses (splitters) that join conductors outside the node reduce bus reliability, eliminate cable interchangeability, reduce compatibility of wiring harnesses, and increase cost.|$|R
50|$|At the {{intersection}} of East 12th Street, the Bayfront Parkway becomes the Bayfront Connector {{and picks up the}} concurrency with Pennsylvania Route 290. After it bridges the railroad tracks owned by CSX, the Connector parallels the tracks for Norfolk Southern. The Connector intersects East 38th Street at angle, prohibiting turns onto 38th Street. After {{the intersection}} of Shannon Road, the Bayfront Connector stops paralleling railroad tracks and crosses Fourmile Creek over the Wintergreen Gorge Bridge. The concurrency for Pennsylvania Route 430 begins at the intersection with Station Road. The entrance to Penn State Erie is on the Connector at the intersection for Hannon Road and Knowledge Parkway. The Bayfront <b>Connector</b> <b>terminates,</b> along with PA 290, at the I-90 interchange, while PA 430 continues as Station Road.|$|R
5000|$|The Sony BVU series added {{longitudinal}} {{and vertical}} interval SMPTE time code, balanced audio XLR connectors, and heavier-duty transport features. The BVU-50 enabled recording {{in the field}} but not playback, and the BVU-100 permitted both recording and playback in the field. Portable recorders were connected to the camera with a multi-conductor cable <b>terminated</b> with multi-pin <b>connectors</b> on each end. The cable carried bi-directional audio, video, synchronisation, record on/off control, and power. Early studio and all portable U-Matic VCRs had a drawer-type mechanism which required the tape to be inserted, followed by manual closure of the drawer (a [...] "top-loading" [...] mechanism). Later studio VCRs accepted the cassette from a port opening and the cassette was pulled into and seated in the transport (a [...] "front-loading" [...] mechanism).|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{simple and}} compact novel-shape planar {{monopole}} antenna for multi-band operation such as DCS, Bluetooth, and ultra-wide-band (UWB) is proposed. Proposed antenna comprises of circular ring with extended rectangular monopole antenna {{in one of}} the arm of the circular ring and inverted L-shape monopole antenna at the centre of the structure is placed to generate multiple resonances at different frequencies. In this structure, Bluetooth frequency band generates due to extended rectangular patch, DCS band by inverted L-patch, and UWB bands due to circular ring. Easily available FR 4 substrate with permittivity 4. 4 and loss tangent 0. 02 is used for fabrication with antenna dimensions (35. 5 × 24. 5 × 1. 6) mm^ 3. Antenna structure is fed through 50 Ω micro-strip line and <b>terminated</b> by SMA <b>connector.</b> Measured return loss of the antenna is ≤− 10 dB with effective control over the three operating frequency bands. In addition, some selected key parameters which affect the impedance bandwidth are analysed and results are discussed...|$|R
25|$|Although {{covered in}} {{industry}} technical standards, {{there is still}} some disagreement on the best way to handle the use of pin 1 for grounding (earthing). The main controversy is whether the shell of the connector should be connected to pin 1 or the shield, or left floating. AES standards mentioned above recommend that shells of cable-mounted connectors should never be connected to pin 1 or the shield, because inadvertent contact of the shell with another grounded surface while in use can create unwanted current paths for fault current, potentially causing hum and other noise. On the other hand, equipment containing active circuitry should always have pin 1 connected to the conductive enclosure of the equipment {{as close as possible to}} the point where the signal enters the enclosure. The argument centers on the radio frequency shielding provided by the shell of the connector, which may be reduced if it is left floating. An alternative solution is to connect the shell to pin 1 and the shield through a small value capacitor, providing RF shielding but allowing very little audio-frequency current to flow. This capability can be built into a fixed jack or a cable <b>terminated</b> with XLR <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} describes two front-end modules {{developed for}} the proposed MIPP upgrade (P- 960) experiment at Fermilab. The scintillation counter module was {{developed for the}} Plastic Ball detector time and charge measurements. The module has eight LEMO 00 input <b>connectors</b> <b>terminated</b> with 50 ohms and accepts negative photomultiplier signals in the range 0. 25 [...] . 1000 pC with the maximum input voltage of 4. 0 V. Each input has a passive splitter with integration and differentiation times of {approx} 20 ns. The integrated portion of the signal is digitized at 26. 55 MHz by Analog Devices AD 9229 12 -bit pipelined 4 -channel ADC. The differentiated signal is discriminated for time measurement and sent {{to one of the}} four TMC 304 inputs. The 4 -channel TMC 304 chip allows high precision time measurement of rising and falling edges with {approx} 100 ps resolution and has internal digital pipeline. The ADC data is also pipelined which allows deadtime-less operation with trigger decision times of {approx} 4 {micro}s. The wire chamber module was developed for MIPP EMCal detector charge measurements. The 32 -channel digitizer accepts differential analog signals from four 8 -channel integrating wire amplifiers. The connection between wire amplifier and digitizer is provided via 26 -wire twist-n-flat cable. The wire amplifier integrates input wire current and has sensitivity of 275 mV/pC and the noise level of {approx} 0. 013 pC. The digitizer uses the same 12 -bit AD 9229 ADC chip as the scintillator counter module. The wire amplifier has a built-in test pulser with a mask register to provide testing of the individual channels. Both modules are implemented as a 6 Ux 220 mm VME size board with 48 -pin power connector. A custom europack (VME) 21 -slot crate is developed for housing these front-end modules...|$|R
40|$|The CMS {{detector}} (Compact Muon Solenoid) {{is under}} construction {{at one of the}} four proton-proton interaction points of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Geneva, Switzerland). The inner tracking system of the CMS experiment consisting of silicon detectors will have a diameter of 2. 4 m and a length of 5. 4 m representing the largest silicon tracker ever. About 15000 silicon strip modules create an active silicon area of 200 m 2 to detect charged particles from proton collisions. They are placed on a rigid carbon fibre structure, providing stability within the working conditions of a 4 T solenoid magnetic field at − 10 oC. Knowledge of the position of the silicon detectors at the level of 100 μm is needed for an efficient pattern recognition of charged particle tracks. Metrology methods are used to survey tracker subdetectors and the integrated Laser Alignment System (LAS) provides absolute positioning of support structure elements to better than 100 μm. Relative movements of the components are resolved and monitored at the 10 μm scale. A robust and reliable optical system able to measure and control the large CMS tracker geometry with high accuracy has been developed and validated. The design and construction of such a system, fully integrated in the silicon tracker, avoiding external reference structures in order to have minimal impact on the tracker layout and consisting of radiation hard and non-magnetic components represents a new scientific challenge. The construction and integration of the LAS fulfilling the requirements, as well as its calibration and performance are described in this thesis. The working principle is based on the partial transparency of silicon for light wavelengths in the near infrared region. The absorbed part of the laser beam generates a signal in the corresponding silicon strip module serving to reconstruct its position. The transmitted part reaches the subsequent module layer generating an optical link between the two layers. Investigation of the light generation and distribution led to a definition of the optical components and their optimization for Laser Alignment purposes. Laser diodes have been qualified as light sources and singlemode optical fibres, <b>terminated</b> by special <b>connectors,</b> distribute the light to the CMS tracker detector. The beamsplitting device, a key component of the LAS light distribution inside the CMS tracker, has been studied in detail. The challenge of splitting one collimated beam into two back-to-back beams inside a small available volume has been solved by using the polarization principle. Special test setups were developed to determine the collinearity of the two outgoing beams with a precision better than 50 μrad and {{it has been shown that}} their relative orientation remains constant under working conditions. The interface between the tracker and the LAS is given by the silicon sensors which are responsible both for particle detection and for the determination of the position of the laser spot. An anti-reflex-coating has been applied on the backside of all alignment sensors to improve their optical properties without deterioration of their tracking performance. A test setup has been developed to simultaneously study the transmission and reflection properties of the alignment sensors. The results are in good agreement with calculations and confirm the high optical quality of the sensors. The working principle of the optical alignment has been verified and the resolution of the laser spot was measured in a test setup with alignment modules arranged according to the CMS tracker endcap (TEC) geometry. For almost all laser spot positions in the TEC, relative module movements at the level of 10 μm were reconstructed. In addition, it has been shown that refraction effects are negligible. Data from Laser Alignment in one TEC sector has been compared with TEC survey measurements. The reconstruction precision of better than 100 μm obtained by two laser beams was independently confirmed by the metrology data, thus validating the performance of the optical alignment. The stringent requirements imposed on the implementation and performance of the Laser Alignment System necessitated the solution of a variety of problems and led to the accumulation of considerable experience in the alignment of particle tracking detectors by optical means...|$|R
