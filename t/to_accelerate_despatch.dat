50|$|Rather {{than relying}} on high {{temperature}} and fluid dynamics <b>to</b> <b>accelerate</b> the reaction mass to high speeds, {{there are a variety}} of methods that use electrostatic or electromagnetic forces <b>to</b> <b>accelerate</b> the reaction mass directly. Usually the reaction mass is a stream of ions. Such an engine typically uses electric power, first to ionize atoms, and then to create a voltage gradient <b>to</b> <b>accelerate</b> the ions <b>to</b> high exhaust velocities.|$|R
