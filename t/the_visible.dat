5|$|<b>The</b> <b>visible</b> {{surface of}} the Sun, the {{photosphere}}, is the layer below which the Sun becomes opaque to visible light. Above the photosphere visible sunlight is free to propagate into space, {{and almost all of}} its energy escapes the Sun entirely. The change in opacity is due to the decreasing amount of H− ions, which absorb visible light easily. Conversely, <b>the</b> <b>visible</b> light we see is produced as electrons react with hydrogen atoms to produce H− ions.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a summary}} of the research, {{atmospheric}} water absorption in such an exoplanet renders it larger in appearance across one part of the infrared spectrum, compared to wavelengths in <b>the</b> <b>visible</b> spectrum. Barman took Knutson's Hubble data on HD 209458 b, applied to his theoretical model, and allegedly identified water absorption in the planet's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Carbonaceous asteroids, {{as their}} name suggests, are carbon-rich. They {{dominate}} the asteroid belt's outer regions. Together they comprise over 75% of <b>the</b> <b>visible</b> asteroids. They are redder in hue {{than the other}} asteroids and have a very low albedo. Their surface composition is similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Chemically, their spectra match the primordial composition of the early Solar System, with only the lighter elements and volatiles removed.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> A-band is <b>visible</b> as dark {{transverse}} lines across myofibers; <b>the</b> I-band is <b>visible</b> as lightly staining transverse lines, and <b>the</b> Z-line is <b>visible</b> as dark lines separating sarcomeres at the light-microscope level.|$|R

50|$|The {{marks on}} the fronton must create a notable {{contrast}} with {{the color of the}} field. To make <b>the</b> difference <b>visible,</b> <b>the</b> marks are often painted.|$|R
5|$|Every prime, non-split {{alternating}} knot or link complement has {{a subdivision}} rule, with some tiles {{that do not}} subdivide, corresponding to the boundary of the link complement. The subdivision rules show what the night sky would look like to someone living in a knot complement; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer would see <b>the</b> <b>visible</b> universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.|$|E
5|$|Further {{concepts}} {{for advanced}} 21st-century space telescopes include the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope, a conceptualized 8- to 16-meter (320- to 640-inch) optical space telescope that if realized {{could be a}} more direct successor to HST, {{with the ability to}} observe and photograph astronomical objects in <b>the</b> <b>visible,</b> ultraviolet, and infrared wavelengths, with substantially better resolution than Hubble or the Spitzer Space telescope. This effort is being planned for the 2025–2035 time frame.|$|E
5|$|Girih are {{elaborate}} interlacing patterns formed of five standardized shapes. The {{style is}} used in Persian Islamic architecture and also in decorative woodwork. Girih designs are traditionally made in different media including cut brickwork, stucco, and mosaic faience tilework. In woodwork, especially in the Safavid period, it could be applied either as lattice frames, left plain or inset with panels such as of coloured glass; or as mosaic panels used to decorate walls and ceilings, whether sacred or secular. In architecture, girih forms decorative interlaced strapwork surfaces from the 15thcentury to the 20thcentury. Most designs {{are based on a}} partially hidden geometric grid which provides a regular array of points; this is made into a pattern using 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotational symmetries which can fill the plane. <b>The</b> <b>visible</b> pattern superimposed on the grid is also geometric, with 6-, 8-, 10- and 12-pointed stars and a variety of convex polygons, joined by straps which typically seem to weave over and under each other. <b>The</b> <b>visible</b> pattern does not coincide with the underlying tiling.|$|E
50|$|In Endless mode, if {{the player}} reaches beyond level 20, {{the cycle of}} backdrops repeats. <b>The</b> highest <b>visible</b> score in Endless mode is 99,999,999, <b>the</b> highest <b>visible</b> level is 999, and <b>the</b> highest <b>visible</b> number of lines {{completed}} is also 999. Once exceeded these displays continue to show these maximum values. A small glitch in the game means that once the score has surpassed the maximum of 99,999,999 it is not saved in the records screen.|$|R

5|$|However, {{further studies}} of <b>the</b> <b>visible</b> and near {{infrared}} spectra suggest a homogeneous surface covered by an intimate 1:1 mixture of amorphous and crystalline ice, together {{with no more}} than 8% organics. The absence of ammonia hydrate excludes cryovolcanism and the observations confirm that the collisional event must have happened more than 100 million years ago, in agreement with the dynamic studies.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, Vera Rubin {{uncovered}} a discrepancy between observed galactic rotation speed and that predicted by <b>the</b> <b>visible</b> mass {{of stars and}} gas. Today, the galaxy rotation problem {{is thought to be}} explained by the presence of large quantities of unseen dark matter. A concept known as the universal rotation curve of spirals, moreover, shows that the problem is ubiquitous in these objects.|$|E
5|$|Initially most of {{the main}} map and minimap are blacked out, but <b>the</b> <b>visible</b> area expands as the player's units explore the map.

5|$|Like Pluto, Makemake appears red in <b>the</b> <b>visible</b> spectrum, and {{significantly}} redder than {{the surface of}} Eris (see colour comparison of TNOs).

5|$|Matter is {{commonly}} {{defined as the}} substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the observable universe. <b>The</b> <b>visible</b> components of the universe are now believed to compose only 4.9 {{percent of the total}} mass. The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent cold dark matter and 68.3 percent dark energy. The exact arrangement of these components is still unknown and is under intensive investigation by physicists.|$|E
5|$|Panavision 3D was {{a system}} for {{presenting}} 3-D film in a digital cinema. It was a passive stereoscopic 3D system that utilized spectral comb filters produced using thin-film optics technology. In such systems, <b>the</b> <b>visible</b> spectrum is broken into alternate bands of light that evenly span the entire visible spectrum.|$|E

5|$|Radio {{astronomy}} uses radiation outside <b>the</b> <b>visible</b> range with wavelengths {{greater than}} approximately one millimeter. Radio astronomy {{is different from}} most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, it is relatively easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} caterpillar, such as many hawkmoths (Sphingidae), have eyespots on their {{anterior}} abdominal segments.

5|$|Spiral galaxies {{resemble}} spiraling pinwheels. Though {{the stars}} and other visible material contained in such a galaxy lie mostly on a plane, the majority of mass in spiral galaxies exists in a roughly spherical halo of dark matter that extends beyond <b>the</b> <b>visible</b> component, {{as demonstrated by the}} universal rotation curve concept.|$|E
