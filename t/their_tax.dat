5|$|Germany was {{affected}} by the European migrant crisis in 2015 as it became the final destination of choice for many asylum seekers from Africa and the Middle East entering the EU. The country took in over a million refugees and migrants and developed a quota system which redistributed migrants around its federal states based on <b>their</b> <b>tax</b> income and existing population density.|$|E
5|$|As all of Springfield {{rushes to}} send out <b>their</b> <b>tax</b> returns just before midnight on April 15, Homer realizes he did not file his. He rushes and {{provides}} false information before delivering it to the post office. The IRS discovers Homer's fraud and arrests him. To avoid prison, Homer agrees to help Agent Johnson of the FBI. With a hidden microphone under his shirt, Homer uncovers that his coworker Charlie is leading a group planning to assault all government officials, but is arrested by the FBI for conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|Because of Plant's injuries, Led Zeppelin did not tour in 1976. Instead, {{the band}} {{completed}} the concert film The Song Remains the Same {{and the accompanying}} soundtrack album. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October 1976, but was given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where, unwilling to tour since 1975 because of <b>their</b> <b>tax</b> exile status, Led Zeppelin faced an uphill battle to recapture the public's affection.|$|E
50|$|It {{is notable}} {{that after the}} end of Amr's rule in Egypt, the {{population}} found <b>their</b> <b>taxes</b> ever increasing. Indeed, under the Umayyad Caliphate the Coptic Christians of Egypt found <b>their</b> <b>taxes</b> higher than the Byzantine Greeks had ever made them.|$|R
50|$|The farmers {{could not}} pay <b>their</b> <b>taxes</b> in {{exchange}} for ownership of the land. But the Sheikhs paid <b>their</b> <b>taxes</b> and registered the land in the owners’ names. And the Sheikhs were satisfied with a legal deed signed from the new owners.|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. instituted {{progressive}} taxation in 1913, {{but according to}} Shamus Khan, in the 1970s, elites used their increasing political power to lower <b>their</b> <b>taxes,</b> and today successfully employ what political scientist Jeffrey Winters calls [...] "the income defense industry" [...] to greatly reduce <b>their</b> <b>taxes.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1989, the Internal Revenue Service began {{investigating}} the Reagans over allegations they owed additional {{tax on the}} gifts and loans of high-fashion clothes and jewelry to the First Lady during {{their time in the}} White House (recipients benefiting from the display of such items recognize taxable income even if they are returned). In 1992, the IRS determined the Reagans had failed to include some $3 million worth of fashion items between 1983 and 1988 on <b>their</b> <b>tax</b> returns; they were billed for a large amount of back taxes and interest, which was subsequently paid.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a North Shore Towers {{resident}} {{noticed a}} zip code error when making an online purchase. After further investigation in 2001, {{it was determined}} that the North Shore Towers was one of four zip codes that were mistakenly charged a Nassau County sales tax of 8.5% instead of the New York City sales tax of 8.25% because the zip codes cross the city line. Residents argued that New York City should receive <b>their</b> <b>tax</b> dollars and not Nassau County. This error was corrected by late 2001.|$|E
5|$|Other federal {{government}} agencies also worked to undermine organizations, {{such as the}} CPUSA, they considered subversive: The Internal Revenue Service investigated 81organizations that were deemed to be subversive, threatening to revoke <b>their</b> <b>tax</b> exempt status; Congress passed a law prohibiting members of subversive organizations from obtaining federal housing benefits; and {{attempts were made to}} deny Social Security benefits, veterans benefits, and unemployment benefits to communist sympathizers.|$|E

5|$|The second {{controversy}} arose as {{a result}} of the renovation of the governor's mansion. Kentucky first lady Phyllis George Brown created the Save the Mansion Fund to help cover the costs of the renovation. When the renovation was complete, she planned a nine-day showcase of the mansion for the general public. Guests were charged $10 to take a tour of the mansion. Legislator Eugene P. Stuart objected to taxpayers being charged a fee to view a mansion <b>their</b> <b>tax</b> dollars supported. He asked Beshear to protest the charge, and Beshear requested an injunction against the Save the Mansion Fund. A Lexington judge refused to grant the injunction, and Beshear appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which upheld the lower court's decision. Beshear's actions caused a rift between him and Governor John Y. Brown, Jr.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Han dynasty, {{the land}} tax rate was reduced to one-hundredth, with lost revenue recouped by {{increasing}} the poll and property tax rates. The poll tax for most adults was 120 coins annually, 240 coins for merchants, and 20 coins for minors aged between three and fourteen years. The lower taxable threshold age for minors increased to seven years during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han (r. 48–33 BC) and onwards. Historian Charles Hucker writes that underreporting of the population by local authorities was deliberate and widespread, since this reduced <b>their</b> <b>tax</b> and labor service obligations rendered to the central government.|$|E
5|$|One {{result of}} the {{economic}} and political tensions was the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, in which widespread rural discontent was followed by an invasion of London involving thousands of rebels. The rebels had many demands, including the effective end of the feudal institution of serfdom and a cap on the levels of rural rents. The ensuing violence took the political classes by surprise and the revolt was not fully put down until the autumn; up to 7,000 rebels were executed in the aftermath. As a {{result of the}} revolt, parliament retreated from the poll tax and instead focused on a system of indirect taxes centring on foreign trade, drawing 80% of tax revenues from the exports of wool. Parliament continued to collect direct tax levies at historically high levels up until 1422, although they reduced them in later years. As a result, successive monarchs found that <b>their</b> <b>tax</b> revenues were uncertain, and HenryVI enjoyed less than half the annual tax revenue of the late 14th century. England's monarchs became increasingly dependent on borrowing and forced loans to meet the gap between taxes and expenditure and even then faced later rebellions over levels of taxation, including the Yorkshire rebellion of 1489 and the Cornish rebellion of 1497 during the reign of HenryVII.|$|E
50|$|In {{public choice}} theory, tax choice (sometimes called {{taxpayer}} sovereignty or earmarking) {{is the belief}} that individual taxpayers should have direct control over how <b>their</b> <b>taxes</b> are spent. Its proponents apply the theory of consumer choice to public finance. They claim taxpayers react positively when they are allowed to allocate portions of <b>their</b> <b>taxes</b> to specific spending.|$|R

25|$|Tax efficiency: ETFs {{generally}} generate {{relatively low}} capital gains, because they typically have low turnover of their portfolio securities. While {{this is an}} advantage they share with other index funds, <b>their</b> <b>tax</b> efficiency is further enhanced {{because they do not}} have to sell securities to meet investor redemptions.|$|E
25|$|Economist Dean Baker {{argues that}} the {{existence}} of tax loopholes, deductions, and credits for the corporate income tax contributes to rising income inequality by permitting large corporations with many accountants to reduce <b>their</b> <b>tax</b> burden and by permitting large accounting firms to receive payments from smaller businesses in exchange for helping these businesses reduce <b>their</b> <b>tax</b> burden. He says that this redistributes large sums of money that would otherwise be taxed to individuals who are already wealthy yet contribute nothing to society in order to obtain this wealth. He further argues that since a large portion of corporate income is reinvested in the business, taxing corporate income amounts to a tax on reinvestment, which he says should be left untaxed. He concludes that eliminating the corporate income tax, while needing to be offset by revenue increases elsewhere, would reduce income inequality.|$|E
25|$|Many pacifists {{who would}} be {{conscientious}} objectors to military service are also opposed to paying taxes to fund the military.

25|$|Over {{the last}} few years, many states and provinces have {{increased}} <b>their</b> <b>tax</b> incentives matching and even exceeding the ones offered in British Columbia which has made it more competitive for the province. These states include Georgia (30% {{based on a minimum}} investment of $500,000), New Mexico (20% Refundable Tax Credit), and North Carolina (25% Refundable Tax Credit).|$|E
25|$|In many low-income countries, the {{majority}} of revenue is collected from a narrow tax base, sometimes because of a limited range of taxable economic activities. There is therefore dependence on few taxpayers, often multinationals, that can exacerbate the revenue challenge by minimising <b>their</b> <b>tax</b> liability, in some cases abusing a lack of capacity in revenue authorities, sometimes through transfer pricing abuse.|$|E
25|$|In tax matters, the SE {{is treated}} the same as any other multi{{national}}, i.e., it {{is subject to the}} tax regime of the national legislation applicable to the company and its subsidiaries. SEs are subject to taxes and charges in all member states where their administrative centres are situated. Thus, <b>their</b> <b>tax</b> status is not perfect as there is still no adequate harmonization at European level.|$|E
