She came by the studio and let me hear her album, which was crazy, and we just went through a couple tracks to see which one I fit on." [...] He continued, [...] "Then she played 'FU' and I {{fell in love with}} it. We just went in there and did it together." [...] Regarding the theme of the song, he explained, [...] "It's two letters 'F' and 'U.' You've just got two letters for somebody when you get to that point, when somebody breaks your heart and you're in a relationship which has gone sour. So now you've only got two letters for them, 'F' and 'U'." [...] Its lyrics dismiss a cheating ex, as mentioned in the lines [...] "I don't really have much to say/ I was over it the second that I saw her name/ I got two letters for you/ One of them is F/ And the other one is U/ 'Cause what you gotta do/ is go get yourself a clue." ...|$|E
500|$|Emily Blunt plays Sergeant Rita Vrataski, {{a veteran}} who guides and trains Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. Blunt {{said of her}} role, [...] "In these male-fueled genres, it's usually the woman who's holding {{the hand of the}} guy and he's running through explosions leading her, and I wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> leading." [...] Chris Nashawaty, {{reviewing}} the film for Entertainment Weekly, called it [...] "the most feminist summer action flick in years". Bustles Alicia Lutes described Rita as [...] "ruthless and exacting in her takedown ... of a bunch of aliens" [...] and said: [...] "This is very much counter to the age-old ideals about ladies being the constant, delicate flowers of emotional heartstring-pulling." [...] Lutes noted how Cage's strength depended on Rita's guidance, as [...] "she trains him, aids him, and protects him (and in turn the fate of humanity) time and time again." [...] Tasha Robinson, writing a piece in The Dissolve about [...] "strong female characters" [...] that lack real purpose in films, said that Rita in Edge of Tomorrow was an exception. Robinson acknowledged that Rita existed to support Cage in his trials, but believed that [...] "the story doesn't degrade, devalue, weaken, or dismiss her".|$|E
500|$|Spears {{explained}} that since {{she did not}} tour to promote Blackout, she was excited about having to include songs from that album into the setlist. The finished setlist would include three songs from Circus, six songs from Blackout and five songs from In the Zone (2003); {{other parts of the}} setlist consist of a medley of [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "Touch of My Hand", both from In the Zone; and a remix of [...] "...Baby One More Time", the only song performed off the album of the same name (1998). [...] "Everytime" [...] was the only song not included in the released setlist but was performed regularly on the show. Magician Ed Alonzo joined Spears in one of the acts, and she played as his assistant. Alonzo stated, [...] "We're going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> classics of magic but a little high-tech. We'll be doing a little dissection, transposition, a vanish, an appearance— and if I do a trick, she doesn't just hold the props, she's actually getting inside the big boxes or I am slicing her up. ... Some of it's pretty scary, but she gets right in there with no reservations." [...] The costumes were designed by Dean and Dan Caten from DSquared2. They recreated classic circus outfits, like clowns, jugglers and trapeze artists in a more provocative way. They commented that, ...|$|E

2500|$|Act Two begins {{six months}} later, and still {{there is no}} sign of Drood. There is much {{speculation}} as to his fate. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Puffer has been investigating Drood's disappearance, but has also noticed a rather seedy looking figure who seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same. It turns out that this man (played by the same actor who plays Drood, normally), Dick Datchery, is a private investigator. They sing [...] "Settling Up The Score". The cast appears and summarizes the situation, warning the audience, [...] "don't fall back on your assumptions, hasty presumptions might do you in!", telling them to think carefully of who they will vote for as the murderer, in the song [...] "Don't Quit While You're Ahead". As the song climbs to a climax, the actors trail off, and the Chairman announces to the audience that it was at this place that Charles Dickens laid down his pen forever. [...] However, they, with the audience's help, will resolve the story and the public voting begins as to who Datchery and The Murderer are; unfortunately, the actress playing Drood and, up to that point, Datchery is not chosen as Datchery and exits the theater in a huff. [...] Once the votes have been tabulated, the cast come out and sing [...] "Don't Quit While You're Ahead" [...] to welcome the audience back into the story and to remind them that the mystery has not been solved.|$|E

Maura was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> polite to Lady Phyllis, but in point of fact Phyllis was lying down in the balcony of her mother's dressing-room, and Maura was gracefully fanning herself under a great cork tree, while Lord Ivinghoe was lying on the grass.|$|E

A little blackened heap of ashes, the mockery of Munza-mulgar, and his mother's speechless and sorrowful ghost. What's more, while he sat idly nibbling his nuts, for his tongue had suddenly wearied of the luscious ground-fruit, he saw moving between the rocks no sweeter company than a she-leopard gazing grinningly on him where he sat beneath his rock.|$|E

I got my place closed in safety, thanks to your continuing; but now I think you have continued long enough. I begin to be alarmed; and because I am afraid I ask you to confront a certain danger'?
