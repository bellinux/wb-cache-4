25|$|Tidal {{power can}} have effects on marine life. The {{turbines}} can accidentally kill swimming sea {{life with the}} rotating blades, although projects {{such as the one}} in Strangford feature a safety mechanism that <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> turbine when marine animals approach. Some fish may no longer utilize the area if threatened with a constant rotating or noise-making object. Marine life is a huge factor when placing tidal power energy generators in the water and precautions are made to ensure that as many marine animals as possible will not be affected by it. The Tethys database provides access to scientific literature and general information on the potential environmental effects of tidal energy.|$|E

500|$|A {{reviewer}} for The Hutchinson News, Jake Coyle, commented, [...] "Director Brad Anderson... {{working from}} the simple, high-concept screenplay by Richard D'Ovidio, ably cuts between Berry's increasingly emotionally-attached Jordan Turner and Breslin's panicking Casey Welson, contrasting the fraught strategizing of Turner with the frantic police pursuit of the kidnapper." [...] Coyle stated that [...] "The Call dials up a shallow thrill ride, but one efficiently peppered with your typical 'don't go in there!' moments," [...] but concluded, [...] "The Call is a rudimentary, almost old-fashioned 90-minute escape that manages to achieve its low ambitions." [...] Rating the film 2 stars out of 4, Coyle writes that once the film [...] "manages to build some suspense from {{the trunk of the}} car-- the clever attempts to elicit help, the dwindling cell phone battery-- its deficiencies become less forgivable once the action <b>turns</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road." ...|$|E

[...] In a climactic scene, Mac tells Rosa Lee that he was once nearly killed in a car crash himself, which forces him to address the question of why he was allowed to live while others have died.
