5|$|Octopuses have {{a closed}} circulatory system, where the blood remains inside blood vessels. Octopuses have three hearts; a {{systemic}} heart that circulates blood round {{the body and}} two branchial hearts that pump it through {{each of the two}} gills. The systemic heart is inactive when the animal is swimming and thus it tires quickly and prefers <b>to</b> <b>crawl.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} groups of {{amphibians}} {{developed in the}} Devonian period, around 370 million years ago, from lobe-finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish. These ancient lobe-finned fish had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them <b>to</b> <b>crawl</b> along the sea bottom. Some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen. They could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves {{out of the water}} and onto dry land if circumstances so required. Eventually, their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Despite being able <b>to</b> <b>crawl</b> on land, many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water. They had started to develop lungs, but still breathed predominantly with gills.|$|E

5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more at risk for lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning <b>to</b> <b>crawl</b> and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E
5|$|As she {{prepares for}} stasis, Ripley finds the alien has stowed-away aboard the shuttle. She {{puts on a}} {{spacesuit}} and opens the shuttle's airlock. The explosive decompression forces the alien into the airlock doorway. She shoots it with a grappling hook to propel it into space, but the gun catches as the airlock closes, tethering the alien to the shuttle. It attempts <b>to</b> <b>crawl</b> {{into one of the}} engines but Ripley fires them to blast the alien into space. After recording the voyage final log entry, she places herself and the cat into stasis for the trip home to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan {{soon became}} a {{favourite}} of the king and was the envy of {{other members of the}} court. A plot was hatched to disgrace him and Dunstan was accused of being involved with witchcraft and black magic. The king ordered him to leave the court and as Dunstan was leaving the palace his enemies physically attacked him, beat him severely, bound him, and threw him into a cesspool. He managed <b>to</b> <b>crawl</b> out and make his way to the house of a friend. From there, he journeyed to Winchester and entered the service of his uncle, Ælfheah, Bishop of Winchester.|$|E
50|$|Should a {{locomotive}} lose a traction motor, the same power is redistributed {{to the remaining}} five traction motors. The Class 43-000 is the first South African diesel-electric locomotive to have dynamic braking {{all the way down}} <b>to</b> <b>crawling</b> speed at 1 kilometre per hour.|$|R

30|$|The {{design of}} the Scorpio {{is based on the}} huntsman spider {{introduced}} in the previous section, to enable it <b>to</b> perform <b>crawling</b> and rolling locomotions. While the huntsman spider has eight legs, the Scorpio robot is designed with four legs which are adequate <b>to</b> perform <b>crawling</b> and rolling locomotions.|$|R
5|$|Females den {{in hollow}} trees. Kits are born blind and helpless. They are {{partially}} covered with fine hair. Kits begin <b>to</b> <b>crawl</b> after about 3 weeks. After about 7 weeks they open their eyes. They start to climb after 8 weeks. Kits are completely {{dependent on their}} mother's milk for the first 8–10 weeks, after which they begin {{to switch to a}} solid diet. After 4 months, kits become intolerant of their litter mates, and at 5 months, the mother pushes them out on their own. After one year, juveniles will have established their own range.|$|E
5|$|Nemerteans {{generally}} move slowly, {{though they}} have occasionally been documented to successfully prey on spiders or insects. Most nemerteans use their external cilia to glide on surfaces on a trail of slime, some of which is produced by glands in the head. Larger species use muscular waves <b>to</b> <b>crawl,</b> and some aquatic species swim by dorso-ventral undulations. Some species burrow by means of muscular peristalsis, and have powerful muscles. Some species of the suborder Monostilifera, whose proboscis have one active stylet, move by extending the proboscis, sticking it to an object and pulling the animal towards the object.|$|E
5|$|Ripley {{discovers that}} Burke sent the colonists to {{investigate}} the derelict spaceship where the Nostromo crew first encountered the eggs, believing he could become wealthy by recovering alien specimens for use as biological weapons. She threatens to expose him, but Bishop informs the group of a greater danger: The power plant was damaged by the dropship crash and will soon explode {{with the force of}} a 40-megaton thermonuclear weapon. He volunteers <b>to</b> <b>crawl</b> through several hundred meters of piping conduits to reach the colony's transmitter and remotely pilot the Sulacos remaining dropship to the surface.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Heritrix {{web crawler}} aims {{to be the}} world's first open source, extensible, web-scale, archival-quality web crawler. It has however been limited in its <b>crawling</b> {{strategies}} <b>to</b> snapshot <b>crawling.</b> This paper reports on work to add the ability <b>to</b> conduct incremental <b>crawls</b> <b>to</b> its capabilities. We first discuss the concept of incremental <b>crawling</b> as opposed <b>to</b> snapshot <b>crawling</b> and then the possible ways to design an effective incremental strategy. An overview is given of the implementation that we did, its limits and strengths are discussed. We then report {{on the results of}} initial experimentation with the new software which have gone well. Finally, we discuss issues that remain unresolved and possible future improvements. ...|$|R
5|$|Shinra pursue Zack and Cloud, {{and catch}} up with them just outside Midgar. Leaving the still semi-conscious Cloud hidden away, Zack fights off an {{enormous}} number of Shinra troops, but is ultimately fatally wounded. Cloud manages <b>to</b> <b>crawl</b> to Zack's body after Shinra has left, and Zack, in his dying breath, bequeaths the Buster Sword to Cloud, as Angeal had done to him. Cloud then begins to walk to Midgar. The epilogue recreates the opening scenes of Final Fantasy VII, as Cloud, his memories confused, claims to be a former SOLDIER.|$|E
5|$|Some {{robotics}} {{research is}} exploring biomimicry of octopus features. Octopus arms can move and sense largely autonomously without intervention from the animal's central nervous system. In 2015 {{a team in}} Italy built soft-bodied robots able <b>to</b> <b>crawl</b> and swim, requiring only minimal computation. In 2017 a German company made an arm with a soft pneumatically controlled silicone gripper fitted with two rows of suckers. It is able to grasp objects such as a metal tube, a magazine, or a ball, and to fill a glass by pouring water from a bottle.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, another German {{machine gun}} opened up, killing Private Styles and {{wounding}} Corporal Upchurch. With Private Beard, Statton began <b>to</b> <b>crawl</b> {{back to his}} own lines, while the inspired 37th Battalion continued its advance and cheered the pair as they went past. Later that evening, Statton, while under heavy machine gun fire, went out and retrieved the badly-wounded Upchurch and the body of Styles. By 20:00, both battalions had reached and consolidated their positions, and were relieved by the British 17th Division the following day.|$|E
40|$|Following {{inflation}} stabilization programmes where a {{fixed exchange}} rate {{was used as an}} anchor, a number of countries have gradually shifted towards a regime of increased flexibility. In particular, Chile, Israel and Mexico have for some years adopted a regime of crawling exchange rate bands. This article documents and analyses their unique experience. Of immediate concern is the question whether the shift from fixed <b>to</b> <b>crawling</b> bands is perceived as the signal of a tilt towards policy relaxation. On the contrary, it could be seen as a way of restoring external competitiveness after a period of real appreciation. The evidence collected in this article supports the latter view. As a way of moving towards a sustainable equilibrium, the shift <b>to</b> <b>crawling</b> bands is found to have had a stabilizing influence on financial markets, on inflation expectations, and on the passthrough from exchange rates to prices. by guest on Septe...|$|R

5|$|The bloody Wheatfield {{remained}} {{quiet for}} the rest of the battle. But it took a heavy toll on the men who traded possession back-and-forth. The Confederates had fought six brigades against 13 (somewhat smaller) Federal brigades, and of the 20,444 men engaged, about 30% were casualties. Some of the wounded managed <b>to</b> <b>crawl</b> to Plum Run but could not cross it. The river ran red with their blood. As with the Cornfield at Antietam, this small expanse of agricultural ground would be remembered by veterans as a name of unique significance in the history of warfare.|$|E
5|$|All nemerteans move slowly, {{using their}} {{external}} cilia {{to glide on}} surfaces on a trail of slime, while larger species use muscular waves <b>to</b> <b>crawl,</b> and some swim by dorso-ventral undulations. A few live in the open ocean while the rest find or make hiding places on the bottom. About a dozen species inhabit freshwater, mainly in the tropics and subtropics, and another dozen species live on land in cool, damp places. Most nemerteans are carnivores, feeding on annelids, clams and crustaceans. A few species are scavengers, and a few species live commensally inside the mantle cavity of molluscs. Some species have devastated commercial fishing of clams and crabs. Nemerteans have few predators. Two species are sold as fish bait.|$|E
5|$|Crush {{attacked}} Doink the Clown {{outside the}} ring {{prior to the}} next match. After getting Doink inside the ring, Crush used his strength advantage to overpower Doink. Doink gained the advantage but missed two attacks from the top rope. Crush used more power moves to wear down Doink, and Doink tried <b>to</b> <b>crawl</b> under the ring. Crush forced Doink back into the ring and performed the Cranium Crunch, a head vice submission hold, on Doink. Doink pulled himself to the ropes and broke the hold. Doink hit the referee and knocked him unconscious; {{as a result of}} this staged ref bump, a second Doink the Clown (portrayed by Steve Keirn) was able to interfere. He hit Crush with a prosthetic arm, which enabled the first Doink to win by pinfall when the referee regained consciousness.|$|E

He told the court, “There are no words in the English language to describe the abhorrence of white prostitutes being procured exclusively for the yellow men from China,” and was agahast “That these girls should be submitted <b>to</b> <b>crawling</b> yellow beasts of the type frequenting such dives.” ...|$|R
5|$|Daljit manages <b>to</b> <b>crawl</b> to the {{recording}} room, where Karan {{is still on}} air. When Karan understands {{that he has been}} shot, they speak amongst themselves for the last time, regarding the others, about Sue and about Daljit's love for her. They are then killed by police commandos while laughing. It is then revealed that McKinley described the third kind of people he came across as being the ones who embraced death as a friend and an equal, with a heartfelt laughter. After their death, the public reacts with outrage and expresses urge to bring Indian politics to justice, following the motives of all the boys.|$|E
5|$|Hodgkinson {{worked his}} way around to the left towards the Indonesian line of approach, {{subsequently}} engaging and killing two more, and wounding a third. Guest gathered the right hand elements of 7 Platoon, hooking around Hodgkinson and counter-attacking the remaining Indonesians, killing the previously wounded soldier and one other. Yet another wounded Indonesian was observed <b>to</b> <b>crawl</b> away while the tenth proceeded to run off unharmed back in the direction from which the patrol had come. Within twenty minutes the contact was over and the Australians proceeded to collect the discarded Indonesian weapons and equipment, including a Browning Automatic Rifle, three MI rifles and 200 rounds of ammunition. Dressed in US steel helmets, green shirts and blue and khaki shorts, the Indonesian soldiers were subsequently identified as members of 440 Battalion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} match Matt Hardy faced Edge, who was {{accompanied}} by Lita, inside a Steel Cage. As the bell rang, Hardy tried to throw Edge face-first into the cage wall but didn't succeed. Back and forth action took place until Hardy got the advantage over Edge. Lita began to climb up {{the outside of the}} cage, but Hardy hit the cage, making Lita fall off. As Lita distracted Hardy, Edge started <b>to</b> <b>crawl</b> out. Hardy noticed this, grabbed Edge, and threw him into a corner. Lita interfered, which led to Hardy delivering a Twist of Fate to Lita. Edge executed a Spear on Hardy for a near-fall. After knocking Edge off the turnbuckle, Hardy delivered a leg drop {{off the top of the}} cage before pinning Edge for the win.|$|E
