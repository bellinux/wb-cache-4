50|$|Mobile banking is {{a service}} {{provided}} by a bank or other financial institution that allows its customers to conduct financial transactions remotely using a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet. Unlike the related internet banking it uses software, usually called an app, provided by the financial institution for the purpose. Mobile banking is usually available on a 24-hour basis. Some financial institutions have restrictions on which accounts may be accessed through mobile banking, {{as well as a}} limit on the amount that can be transacted. Transactions through mobile banking may include obtaining account balances and lists of latest transactions, electronic bill payments, and funds transfers between a customer's or another's accounts. Some apps also enable copies of statements to be downloaded and sometimes printed at the customer's premises; and some banks charge a fee for mailing hardcopies of bank statements. From the bank's point of view, mobile banking reduces the cost of handling transactions by reducing the need for customers to visit a bank branch for non-cash withdrawal and deposit transactions. Mobile banking does not handle transactions involving cash, and a customer needs to visit an ATM or bank branch for cash withdrawals or deposits. Many apps now have a remote deposit option; using the device's camera to digitally transmit cheques to their financial institution. Mobile banking differs from mobile payments, which involves the use of a mobile device to pay for goods or services either at the point of sale or remotely, analogously to the use of a debit or credit card <b>to</b> <b>effect</b> <b>an</b> EFTPOS <b>payment.</b>|$|R

The Football Association of Ireland's chief {{executive}} John Delaney, speaking on national radio after Blatter's resignation, recalled: [...] "In 2009, when Blatter insulted Ireland {{in the aftermath}} of the Thierry Henry handball incident I called him an embarrassment to FIFA and to himself. He called me over about that, across the table like I am talking to you, with one or two expletives. That was in a room. He said, 'No-one speaks to me like that', and I said, 'well I do' and that was that." [...] In 2009, Delaney said of the handball incident, [...] "It's not about money. This is about sporting integrity." [...] In June 2015, Delaney confirmed that FIFA gave the FAI a [...] "loan" [...] of €5 million which was in <b>effect</b> <b>a</b> <b>payment</b> not <b>to</b> proceed with legal action over the handball decision and consequent elimination from the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The loan was written off in 2014.|$|R
