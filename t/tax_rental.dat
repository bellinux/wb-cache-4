25|$|World War II's broader scope {{required}} {{passage of}} the National Resources Mobilization Act to supplement the powers in the War Measures Act to pursue the national war effort. The extent to which wartime federal power could expand was further clarified in the Chemicals Reference (which held that Orders in Council under the War Measures Act were equivalent to acts of parliament) and the Wartime Leasehold Regulations Reference, which held that wartime regulations could displace provincial jurisdiction {{for the duration of}} an emergency. Additional measures were required in order to secure control of the economy during that time. Jurisdiction over unemployment insurance was transferred permanently to the federal sphere; the provinces surrendered their power to levy succession duties and personal and corporate income taxes {{for the duration of the}} war (and for one year afterwards) under the Wartime <b>Tax</b> <b>Rental</b> Agreement; and labour relations were centralized under federal control with the Wartime Labour Relations Regulations (lasting until 1948), in which the provinces ceded their jurisdiction over all labour issues.|$|E
50|$|Many states <b>tax</b> <b>rental</b> of {{tangible}} personal property. Often the tax is {{not dependent on}} the use to which the property will be put. Only Florida charges sales tax on the rental of commercial real estate.|$|E
50|$|The {{imposition}} of sales tax would continue until 1964 (when the province {{would take over}} the field), and the municipal income tax would be abolished {{with the implementation of}} the Wartime <b>Tax</b> <b>Rental</b> Agreements of 1941.|$|E
50|$|Florida is {{the only}} state to charge sales <b>tax</b> on the <b>rental</b> of real estate, {{commercial}} or residential, raising {{more than a billion dollars}} a year from the <b>tax.</b> Residential <b>rentals</b> of more than six months are exempted from the tax.|$|R
50|$|The Ministry of Energy is a Cabinet-level {{agency of}} the {{government}} of the Canadian province of Alberta responsible for coordinating policy relating to the development of mineral and energy resources. It is also responsible for assessing and collecting non-renewable resource (NRR) royalties, freehold mineral <b>taxes,</b> <b>rentals,</b> and bonuses. The Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission, which is fully integrated with the Department of Energy within the ministry, and fully funded by the Crown, accepts delivery of the Crown's royalty share of conventional crude oil and sells it at the current market value.|$|R

50|$|Municipal {{income taxes}} existed {{as well in}} certain municipalities, but such {{taxation}} powers were gradually abolished as the provinces established their own collection r√©gimes, and none survived the Second World War, {{as a consequence of}} the Wartime <b>Tax</b> <b>Rental</b> Agreements.|$|E
50|$|Newfoundland {{was also}} given {{statutory}} subsidies, a special subsidy of $1.1 million, {{the right to}} enter into <b>tax</b> <b>rental</b> agreements {{with the federal government}} and an additional transitional grant of $3.5 million, diminishing by 10 per cent per year for a total of 12 years. Also, as a safety net, it was agreed a Royal Commission would review finances.|$|E
5000|$|Revenue Share - Here, the {{exhibitor}} {{shares with}} the distributor, in a pre-set ratio (typically 1:2), the entire box office {{collection of the}} film after deducting entertainment <b>tax.</b> <b>Rental</b> is not chargeable per show. So, the entire risk of box office performance {{of the film is}} shared between the exhibitor and distributor. This is the most common channel preferred by multiplex screens.|$|E

50|$|A true {{consumption}} tax would <b>tax</b> the imputed <b>rental</b> {{value of the}} home (which could be determined {{in the same way}} that valuation occurs for property tax purposes) and would not tax the increase in the value of the asset (the home). Andrews proposes to ignore this method of <b>taxing</b> imputed <b>rental</b> values because of its complexity. In the United States, home ownership is subsidized by the federal government by permitting a deduction for mortgage interest expense and exempting a significant increase in value from the capital gains tax. Therefore, treating renters and homeowners identically under a {{consumption tax}} may not be feasible there.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{the resort}} {{features}} {{a wealth of}} recreational and leisure facilities {{as well as a}} beach and spa hotel.

50|$|The sale or lease {{of motor}} {{vehicles}} {{for use on}} the road incurs an additional 0.3% <b>tax,</b> <b>rental</b> of a car for less than 30 days has an additional state/local tax of 8.9%. When renting a car for less than 30 days in Seattle, the total sales tax is 18.6%. When purchasing an automobile, if one trades in a car, the state subtracts {{the price of the}} trade when calculating the sales tax to be paid on the automobile (e.g., purchasing a $40,000 car, and trading a $10,000 car, a person would be taxed on the difference of $30,000 only, not the full amount of the new vehicle).|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, Republicans in the General Assembly passed {{their own}} transportation-funding bill. Rather than a statewide tax {{increase}} {{to finance the}} transportation improvements, as Kaine and most legislative Democrats favored, the Republican bill called for transportation funding [...] "to come from borrowing $2.5 billion and paying the debt costs out of the general fund"; authorized local tax increase in Northern Virginia; increased fees and <b>taxes</b> on <b>rental</b> cars, commercial real estate, and hotels; and increased traffic infraction fines and driver's licenses fees.|$|R
5000|$|Minimum Guarantee + Royalty - Here, the {{producer}} sells the distribution rights for a defined territory {{for a minimum}} lump sum irrespective of the box office performance of the film. Any surplus is shared between {{the producer}} and distributor, in a pre-set ratio (typically 1:2) after deducting entertainment <b>tax,</b> show <b>rentals,</b> commission, print costs and publicity costs. Effectively, the distributor becomes a [...] "financier" [...] {{in the eyes of}} the market. This is the most common channel available to high budget producers.|$|R

5|$|Two of Daniels' other tax {{proposals}} were approved: {{a tax on}} liquor and beverages to fund {{the construction of the}} Lucas Oil Stadium and a <b>tax</b> on <b>rental</b> cars to expand the Indiana Convention Center.

5000|$|But in October 1999, staff {{presented}} to City Council the bond covenants contract governing the construction bond sale, {{the terms of}} which redefined the project and the financing authorized by voters and by Council. The bond covenants undermined the recently adopted Jim Smith finance plan by specifying a car <b>rental</b> <b>tax</b> funds dispersal [...] "waterfall" [...] such that covering any operations and maintenance (O&M) shortfall for the PEC would take complete priority over any park construction funding. [...] The staff presentation of the covenants to City Council {{made no mention of}} <b>rental</b> <b>tax</b> dollars being redirected to O&M, and the covenants were adopted on consent without discussion. Jim Smith‚Äôs August 2000 financial update to Council insisted that the park financing was on track and might even be accelerated, even though its underpinnings had been destroyed. Council remained uninformed of the waterfall until Spring 2002. The stakeholders who had brought the project successfully to the City and had been given a formal oversight role were not informed at all until mid-2003. Though the ballot language had only specified that the <b>rental</b> <b>tax</b> would fund construction, the bond covenants had redefined the ballot word [...] "construction" [...] to include operations and maintenance, and had reduced even the designation of park development to [...] "any other legal purpose" [...] under state law.|$|R
50|$|ACRA is {{actively}} lobbying to eliminate excise <b>taxes</b> on car <b>rental</b> transactions {{in state and}} local governments.

50|$|By 1998, the Dallas Mavericks, then {{owned by}} H. Ross Perot, Jr., and the Dallas Stars were {{indicating}} {{their desire for}} a new facility to replace the dated Reunion Arena. Dallas taxpayers approved a new hotel <b>tax</b> and <b>rental</b> car <b>tax</b> {{to pay for a}} new facility to cover a portion of the funding, with the two benefiting teams, the Mavericks and the Stars, picking up the remaining costs, including cost overruns. The new arena was to be built just north of Woodall Rodgers Freeway near Interstate 35E on the site of an old power plant.|$|R
