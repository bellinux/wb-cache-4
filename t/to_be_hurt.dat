5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hurt.</b> That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E
5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hurt</b> until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E

They also asserted that they least trusted the police (3% not very much; 7% not at all) and the mass media (3% not very much; 5% not at all). Additionally, the majority of children reported being aware of their rights (78%), with their right to education (72%), right not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hurt</b> or mistreated (63%), and right to health (62%) most widely recognized.

500|$|The University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette's [...] "Ragin' Cajuns" [...] are {{sometimes}} cited as counter-arguments {{to those that}} favor change. However, rather than referring to [...] "others" [...] these teams employ symbols that European American cultures have historically used to represent themselves. The University of Notre Dame mascot, the UND leprechaun is a mythical being that represents the Irish, which is both an ethnic and a national group. The University of Louisiana at Lafayette mascot is an anthropomorphic cayenne pepper, an ingredient frequently found in Cajun cuisine. Opponents also see this argument as a false equivalency, because it ignores systemic inequality, and serves to discount the Native American voice by saying that if one group isn't hurt by a particular portrayal, then no group has the right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hurt,</b> regardless of vastly different backgrounds, treatment, and social positions.|$|E

500|$|Stephen, born on Christmas Eve {{and named}} for the first martyr of Christianity, dreams as a child that [...] "in some queer way she [...] Jesus". When she discovers that Collins, object of her {{childhood}} crush, has housemaid's knee, she prays that the affliction be transferred to her: [...] "I would like to wash Collins in my blood, Lord Jesus– I would like very much to be a Saviour to Collins– I love her, and I want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hurt</b> like You were". This childish desire for martyrdom prefigures Stephen's ultimate self-sacrifice for Mary's sake. After she tricks Mary into leaving her– carrying out a plan that leads Valérie to exclaim [...] "you were made for a martyr!"– Stephen, left alone in her home, sees the room thronged with inverts, living, dead and unborn.

500|$|James M. Redfield, a {{classics}} {{professor at}} the University of Chicago, in his article [...] "An Aristotelian Analysis of Miss Moppet" [...] finds the story follows the tenets of Aristotle's Poetics, with a definite beginning (the unsuccessful attempt to catch the mouse), middle (Miss Moppet pretending <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hurt</b> and catching the mouse), and end (Miss Moppet teasing the mouse and his escape). Redfield notes that Potter makes {{the outcome of the}} plot uncertain and creates parity between the characters, which are naturally predator and prey; Potter makes Miss Moppet [...] "young, inexperienced, female, and a pet", while the mouse is [...] "mature, courageous, male, and independent". Redfield praises Potter's skill as an author; she uses the hole in the duster twice—to allow Miss Moppet to catch the mouse, but then for him to escape her—and uses phrases particularly suited for a parent to read aloud to a child ("This is the mouse..."). Redfield concludes that while teasing is bad in the story—dangerous for the mouse, and cruel for the cat—Potter herself teases the reader in a good way, showing [...] "us that teasing is a kind of loving when {{it is a kind of}} teaching. The poet plays with us, and by taking us through an unreal experience, teaches us what it is to live in the real world." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1997, {{researchers}} Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa {{observed that}} studies repeatedly showed that Japanese {{people do not}} seek to maintain and enhance their self-esteem, unlike Europeans and Americans. Whereas research with Western participants found that, on average, people falsely believe they are better than average, that they take credit for successes and blame others for failures, and that they overestimate the chances of good fortune happening to them, studies with Japanese did not reveal such self-enhancing tendencies. In addition, in cross-cultural studies, Japanese reported self-esteem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hurt</b> more by failures than boosted by successes, {{the opposite of what}} was reported by Americans. All these studies involved participants being aware that their self-esteem was being evaluated, and hence they are said to be measures of explicit self-esteem. This made Kitayama and Karasawa wonder. It seemed unlikely to them that Japanese have no positive feelings attached to their selves. They hypothesized that somehow Japanese do not allow these feelings to be detected overtly. To test this, they ran two experiments that hid the aim of assessing self-esteem, measuring instead implicit self-esteem. [...] Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to introspection, measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts. The first experiment was a replica of Nuttin's 1987 study of letter preference, looking for an effect tied to letters of the participant's name. The second experiment involved numbers, looking for an effect tied to numbers representing the day of the month a participant was born (between 1 and 31) and the month of their birthday (between 1 and 12).|$|E

Beyoncé later appeared performing [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] wearing Ray-Bans, a leather breastplate, aviator shades and a bulletproof-looking one-piece further asking the crowd to sing along the track. During the bridge of the song, she included excerpts from Morissette's [...] "You Oughta Know" [...] and Tupac Shakur's [...] "California Love" [...] while imitating a male person with her moves. Alice Jones of The Independent wrote in her review that Beyoncé [...] "whip up a quasi-feminist singalong." [...] Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone noted that the singer channeled her [...] "ferocious onstage persona", Sasha Fierce.

[...] "Flaws and All" [...] featured Beyoncé making facial expressions as she dedicated the song to her fans, singing the lines, [...] "I don't know why you love me/And that's why I love you." [...] During the performance of [...] "Irreplaceable", she asked from the crowd to sing the lines [...] "to the left" [...] along with her and made a competition in singing between sections. The first verse and the chorus were sung solely by the crowd. The intro of [...] "Countdown" [...] began with Beyoncé's ululations and moans, the Boyz II Men sample used in the song, and the opening drum crack and continued with the song's music video being projected on the screen. Brief snippets of Beyoncé performing Destiny's Child's [...] "Jumpin', Jumpin'" [...] (2000) followed. [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] {{was performed}} with a march choreography and a funky version of [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] followed. During the end, the song's beat got transformed into an extended outro. Prior {{the end of the show}} a home-video sequence showing Beyoncé biking, drinking a pint of Guinness, going whale-watching and holding her daughter Blue Ivy Carter with a voice-over was shown. Referencing her song [...] "I Was Here" [...] which was played in the background, she said [...] "When I leave this world I'll leave no regrets.

Beyoncé went on to perform [...] "Halo" [...] in a red dress which she opened with a performance of Whitney Houston's [...] "I Will Always Love You" [...] as a tribute to her following her death.
