The Hadley-Apennine site was chosen with the specific objectives of sampling material from deeper within the Moon <b>than</b> <b>had</b> been obtained from the Fra Mauro formation on Apollo 14 and investigating Hadley Rille, a sinuous rille possibly formed by volcanic activity.|$|E

5|$|During the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802, {{the delegates}} {{allegedly}} received reports from a fur trapper that Lake Michigan extended significantly farther south <b>than</b> <b>had</b> previously been believed (or mapped). Thus, {{it was possible}} that an east–west line extending east from Lake Michigan's southern tip might intersect Lake Erie somewhere east of Maumee Bay, or worse, might not intersect the lake at all; the farther south that Lake Michigan actually extended, the more land Ohio would lose, perhaps even the entire Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|During the launch, Launch Pad 39A {{sustained}} substantial damage, more <b>than</b> <b>had</b> {{been seen}} on any previous launch. Following liftoff, inspectors discovered that {{bricks and mortar}} from the launch pad's base had been thrown {{as far as the}} perimeter fence, a distance of 1,500 feet (457m).|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Armstrong {{was praised}} {{by some as}} a heroine for her actions during the battle, {{displaying}} the kind of courage under fire the militia had so badly lacked during the first months of the Black Hawk War. Her actions, in part, helped the fort's outnumbered defenders give Black Hawk the impression the Apple River Fort was more heavily defended <b>than</b> <b>had</b> been anticipated.|$|E

5|$|In 1771, {{using the}} {{combined}} 1761 and 1769 transit data, the French astronomer Jérôme Lalande calculated the astronomical unit {{to have a}} value of 153 million kilometers (±1 million km). The precision was less <b>than</b> <b>had</b> been hoped for because of the black drop effect, but still a considerable improvement on Horrocks's calculations.|$|E
5|$|Launched in 1991, Japan's Yohkoh (Sunbeam) {{satellite}} observed solar flares at X-ray wavelengths. Mission data allowed {{scientists to}} identify several {{different types of}} flares, and demonstrated that the corona away from regions of peak activity was much more dynamic and active <b>than</b> <b>had</b> previously been supposed. Yohkoh observed an entire solar cycle but went into standby mode when an annular eclipse in 2001 caused it to lose its lock on the Sun. It was destroyed by atmospheric re-entry in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{classical}} composers from Japan include Toru Takemitsu and Rentarō Taki. Popular {{music in}} post-war Japan has been {{heavily influenced by}} American and European trends, {{which has led to}} the evolution of J-pop, or Japanese popular music. Karaoke is the most widely practiced cultural activity in Japan. A 1993 survey by the Cultural Affairs Agency found that more Japanese had sung karaoke that year <b>than</b> <b>had</b> participated in traditional pursuits such as flower arranging (ikebana) or tea ceremonies.|$|E

Two years later, he published his theory for a particle storage ring. This invention allowed particle accelerators at much higher energies <b>than</b> <b>had</b> previously been possible. In 1965 at Stanford University, he performed the first colliding beam physics experiment.|$|E
5|$|On {{its passage}} northward, Southern Cross halted at Franklin Island, off the Victoria Land coast, {{and made a}} series of {{magnetic}} calculations. These indicated that the location of the South Magnetic Pole was, as expected, within Victoria Land, but further north and further west <b>than</b> <b>had</b> previously been assumed. The party then sailed for home, crossing the Antarctic Circle on 28 February. On 1 April, news of their safe return was sent by telegram from Bluff, New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Spectroscopic {{observations}} in the 1900s gave the first {{clues about the}} Venusian rotation. Vesto Slipher tried to measure the Doppler shift of light from Venus, but found he could not detect any rotation. He surmised the planet must have a much longer rotation period <b>than</b> <b>had</b> previously been thought. Later work in the 1950s showed the rotation was retrograde. Radar observations of Venus were first {{carried out in the}} 1960s, and provided the first measurements of the rotation period, which were close to the modern value.|$|E

5|$|The K'iche' conquest {{appears to}} have taken place around AD1000, some four centuries earlier <b>than</b> <b>had</b> been {{supposed}} using calculations based on the indigenous accounts. After the initial arrival of the K'iche' activity continued at the site without pause, and the local styles were simply replaced by styles associated with the conquerors. This suggests that the original inhabitants abandoned the city they had occupied for almost two millennia.|$|E
5|$|The Naval Treaties of the 1920s and 1930s {{limited the}} number of battleships, though {{technical}} innovation in battleship design continued.

5|$|The Royal Navy had {{conducted}} {{trials in}} 1913 with a modified cruiser, , {{to evaluate the}} ability of seaplanes {{to work with the}} fleet. They were successful enough that the Admiralty allocated £81,000 in the 1914–1915 Naval Programme to purchase a merchant ship for a more thorough modification <b>than</b> <b>had</b> been possible with Hermes to better accommodate seaplanes. A tramp steamer was purchased in 1914 that had just begun construction at the Blyth Shipbuilding Company so it could be easily modified to suit its new role.|$|E

The Act of Uniformity 1662, a law {{requiring}} even greater adherence to the Book of Common Prayer and support for episcopalianism <b>than</b> <b>had</b> previously been required, forced Puritan ministers to leave the Church. Though some presbyterians continued to desire to be readmitted to the established church, restrictions on worship for non-conformists led to presbyterians putting aside differences with congregationalists and adopting congregational church orders.|$|E
