5|$|RNAs are a type {{of large}} {{biological}} molecules, whose individual building blocks are called nucleotides. The name poly(A) tail (for polyadenylic acid tail) reflects the way RNA nucleotides are abbreviated, with a letter for the base the nucleotide contains (A for adenine, C for cytosine, G for guanine and U for uracil). RNAs are produced (<b>transcribed)</b> from a DNA template. By convention, RNA sequences are written in a 5' to 3' direction. The 5' end {{is the part of}} the RNA molecule that is <b>transcribed</b> first, and the 3' end is <b>transcribed</b> last. The 3' end is also where the poly(A) tail is found on polyadenylated RNAs.|$|E

2500|$|Lingala {{is more a}} spoken {{language}} than a written language, and has several different writing systems, most of them ad hoc. Due to the low literacy of Lingala speakers in Lingala (in the Republic of the Congo literacy rate in Lingala as a first language is between 10% and 30%), its popular orthography is very flexible and varies from one Congo to the other. Some orthographies are heavily influenced by the French language orthography; including double S, ss, to <b>transcribe</b> [...] (in the Republic of the Congo); ou for [...] (in the Republic of the Congo); i with trema, aï, to <b>transcribe</b> [...] or e with acute accent, é, to <b>transcribe</b> e to <b>transcribe</b> , o with acute accent, ó, to <b>transcribe</b> [...] or sometimes [...] in opposition to o <b>transcribing</b> [...] or i or y can both <b>transcribe</b> [...] The allophones are also found as alternating forms in the popular orthography; sango is an alternative to nsango (information or news); nyonso, nyoso, nionso, nioso (every) are all transcriptions of nyɔ́nsɔ.|$|R

5|$|A typical protein-coding gene {{is first}} copied into RNA as an {{intermediate}} {{in the manufacture of}} the final protein product. In other cases, the RNA molecules are the actual functional products, as in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA. Some RNAs known as ribozymes are capable of enzymatic function, and microRNA has a regulatory role. The DNA sequences from which such RNAs are <b>transcribed</b> are known as non-coding RNA genes.|$|E
5|$|According {{to one of}} her biographers, Giles St Aubyn, Victoria {{wrote an}} average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life. From July 1832 until just before her death, she kept a {{detailed}} journal, which eventually encompassed 122 volumes. After Victoria's death, her youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice, was appointed her literary executor. Beatrice <b>transcribed</b> and edited the diaries covering Victoria's accession onwards, and burned the originals in the process. Despite this destruction, much of the diaries still exist. In addition to Beatrice's edited copy, Lord Esher <b>transcribed</b> the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them. Part of Victoria's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by A. C. Benson, Hector Bolitho, George Earle Buckle, Lord Esher, Roger Fulford, and Richard Hough among others.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} by the gap existing {{between theory and practice}} in teaching listening. Most of the techniques used to teach listening put more emphasis on top-down processing while listeners’ problems are more of perceptive ones (bottom-up). In order to address the pervasive decoding problem in listening, this study suggests using <b>transcribing</b> exercise as an input enhancement device and investigates its effect on beginning learners’ listening ability. To this end, 31 learners participated in the study. The control group did not have any <b>transcribing</b> practice while the experimental group received <b>transcribing</b> exercise. In the data analysis step, an independent samples t test was employed to compare the two groups. The results show that <b>transcribing</b> has a significant positive effect on beginning learners’ listening comprehension. The findings of the study as well as advantages of <b>transcribing</b> exercise are discussed. Implications of the study and scope for future research are also addressed. </p...|$|R
