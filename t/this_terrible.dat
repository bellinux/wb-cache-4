25|$|In 1916 whilst {{serving in}} the Lincolnshire Regiment, {{suffering}} from severe lumbago Jessop {{was sent to a}} clinic in Bath The Radiant Heat Treatment ' involved dousing with total immersion for 30 minutes at a temperature of 210-310 degrees F'. The patient was placed in an up-ended coffin like structure and steamed up. If he became too uncomfortable he could raise the lid and get out. By some 'accident' the catch fell, the attendant had gone away and Jessop was unable to summon assistance. When he was eventually rescued his heart had been seriously damaged by <b>this</b> <b>terrible</b> ordeal. In a matter of minutes the sporting life of one of the greatest athletes had come to an abrupt end.|$|E

25|$|If {{you could}} {{demonstrate}} that the BBC was grossly extravagant {{there might be a}} case for saying OK take it away. But in fact the BBC per minute in almost every category is as cheap as you can find anywhere in the world and produces the best quality. If you take the money away, which part of the BBC will you remove? The BBC has gone through swingeing staff cuts. It has been cut to the bone, if you divert licence fee money elsewhere, you cut quality and services. There is always that threat from politicians who will say your licence fee is up for grabs. We will take it. There {{is a lot of people}} who want to see the BBC weakened. They talk of <b>this</b> <b>terrible</b> tax of the licence fee. Yet it is the best bargain that is going. Four radio channels and god knows how many TV channels. It is piffling.|$|E
25|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I was present at an operation performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout <b>this</b> <b>terrible</b> operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with him, and we met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E

500|$|The Goddess-oriented {{festival of}} Durga Puja in the Hindu month of Ashvin (October) is celebrated for sixteen days, {{culminating}} with Vijayadashami. On Vijayadashami, Vimala is worshipped by the titular Gajapati king of Puri as the goddess Durga, who {{is believed to}} have slain the demon Mahishasura on this day. The earliest record of this is the New Delhi Konark stele, which narrate that King Narasimhadeva I (reign: 1238–1264) worshipped Durga-Madhava (Vimala-Jagannath) on the tenth day of Durga Puja, that is, Vijayadashami. As the goddess is believed to assume a destructive aspect during the Durga Puja, women are debarred in the temple as they are considered too [...] "weak-hearted" [...] to witness <b>this</b> <b>terrible</b> form of the goddess.|$|E

During this period he worked on behalf of refugees from Nazi Germany, and was chairman of the Polish Refugee Fund which provided relief to displaced Jewish children. On 3 September 1939, after Neville Chamberlain's announcement of war with Germany, Lansbury addressed the House of Commons. Observing that the cause to which he had dedicated his life was going down in ruins, he added: [...] "I hope that out of <b>this</b> <b>terrible</b> calamity will arise a spirit that will compel people to give up the reliance on force." ...|$|E

500|$|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks {{received}} favorable {{reviews and}} was ranked the 5th greatest Dungeons & Dragons adventure {{of all time}} by Dungeon magazine in 2004, on the 30th anniversary of the Dungeons & Dragons game. Judge Bill Slavicsek felt the adventure was a [...] "classic clash of genres". It was not something he felt should be done often, but it made a [...] "memorable diversion". Judge Mike Mearls described how he felt {{the first time he}} read Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. [...] "I had <b>this</b> <b>terrible,</b> terrible conflict within myself to immediately tell my friends about it at war with a maniacal, desperate drive to keep it hidden at all costs." [...] Judge Keith Baker was most impressed with the adventure's art. He liked that it came with a separate book of art; in particular the before and after illustrations of the carnivorous plant with a [...] "built-in bunny lure". This was later featured in a Wizards.com [...] "Ask Wizards" [...] segment. According to the Dungeon editors, the adventure's defining moment was its froghemoth creature, and its full page color illustration.|$|E
500|$|A {{legacy of}} <b>this</b> <b>terrible</b> summer was {{the de facto}} racial {{segregation}} of many of Omaha's neighborhoods. Introduced in the 1930s, the practices of redlining by banks and racially restrictive housing covenants effectively ended for decades the ability of African Americans to buy or rent outside North Omaha. Originally built in the 1930s, Omaha housing projects were intended for occupancy without reference to race. A 1937 report from the Omaha Housing Authority reported that residents included [...] "both black and white occupants and there are 284 units. There is no distinct segregation of the whites from the blacks but individual buildings will be confined to either Negro or white." [...] The Logan Fontenelle Housing Project, built during the Depression, with an addition completed in 1941, to improve working class housing in North Omaha, was closed to African Americans through the 1950s. [...] Even in the 1940s, housing was so overcrowded {{in the area that}} some families stayed at the projects although their income exceeded the limits, because they couldn't find housing elsewhere. [...] With civil rights challenges, the segregation policy that kept African Americans out of public housing changed in the 1960s.|$|E
