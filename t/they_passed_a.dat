5|$|Hayes's later {{attempts}} {{to protect the}} rights of southern blacks were ineffective, as were his {{attempts to}} rebuild Republican strength in the South. He did, however, defeat Congress's efforts to curtail federal power to monitor federal elections. Democrats in Congress passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which had been used to suppress the Ku Klux Klan. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the offensive rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being.|$|E
5|$|Randall's {{determination}} to cut spending, combined with Southern Democrats' desire to reduce federal power {{in their home}} states, led the House to pass an army appropriation bill with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which {{had been used to}} suppress the Ku Klux Klan.

Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation.

The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall's role in the process was limited, but the Democrats' failure to force Hayes's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880.|$|E

25|$|Like other Southern states, by {{the late}} 1870s white Democrats regained {{control of the state}} legislature, often with a mix of {{intimidation}} and terrorism by paramilitary groups operating for the Democratic Party. <b>They</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> new constitution in 1876 that segregated schools and established a poll tax to support them, but it was not originally required for voting.|$|E
25|$|With white Democrats having regained {{power in}} the state legislature, <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> poll tax in 1877, which disenfranchised many poor blacks and whites, {{preventing}} them from registering. In 1908, the state established a white primary; with the only competitive contests within the Democratic Party, it was another way to exclude blacks from politics. They constituted 46.7% of the state's population in 1900, but the proportion of Georgia's population that was African American dropped thereafter to 28% primarily due to leaving the state during the Great Migration. This disfranchisement persisted through the mid-1960s, until federal legislation with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.|$|E
25|$|The colonists {{responded by}} {{establishing}} the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, effectively removing Crown {{control of the}} colony outside Boston. Meanwhile, representatives from twelve colonies convened the First Continental Congress {{to respond to the}} crisis. The Congress narrowly rejected a proposal which would have created an American parliament to act in concert with the British Parliament; instead, <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> compact declaring a trade boycott against Britain. Congress also affirmed that Parliament had no authority over internal American matters, but they were willing to consent to trade regulations {{for the benefit of the}} empire, and they authorized committees and conventions to enforce the boycott. The boycott was effective, as imports from Britain dropped by 97% in 1775 compared to 1774.|$|E

25|$|Attempted {{reform of}} labor {{relations}} in the mid-1970s also included severe restrictions on rights to discharge workers once <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> brief trial period of employment. A review process set up to examine disputes was implemented {{in a way that}} made discharges practically impossible. Businesspeople circumvented the restrictions to some degree by hiring workers on a temporary basis up to the point at which they would have to be kept and then letting them go before the restrictions applied. Businesspeople remained unremittingly hostile to this type of regulation, primarily on the grounds that it took away their main means of exercising discipline over their workers. This form of regulation was also eliminated shortly after Velasco lost power.|$|E

The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being. Hayes's strong stance against the Democratic attempts to repeal the election laws earned him the support of many in the North and boosted his unpopularity among many Republicans who had been alienated by his civil service reform efforts.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, Fianna Fáil members {{took the}} Oath of Allegiance {{and entered the}} Dáil, {{effectively}} recognising {{the legitimacy of the}} Free State. The Free State was already moving towards independence by this point. Under the Statute of Westminster 1931, the British Parliament gave up its right to legislate for members of the British Commonwealth. When elected to power in 1932, Fianna Fáil under de Valera set about dismantling what they considered to be objectionable features of the treaty, abolishing the Oath of Allegiance, removing the power of the Office of Governor General (British representative in Ireland) and abolishing the Senate, which was dominated by former Unionists and pro-treaty Nationalists. In 1937, <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> new constitution, which made a President the head of state, did not mention any allegiance to the British monarch, and which included a territorial claim to Northern Ireland. The following year, Britain returned without conditions the seaports that it had kept {{under the terms of the}} treaty. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, the Free State was able to demonstrate its independence by remaining neutral throughout the war, although Dublin did to some extent tacitly support the Allies. Finally, in 1948, a coalition government, containing elements of both sides in the Civil War (pro-treaty Fine Gael and anti-treaty Clann na Poblachta) left the British Commonwealth and renamed the Free State the Republic of Ireland. By the 1950s, the issues over which the Civil War had been fought were largely settled.|$|E

500|$|Pauline found a {{temporary}} {{place to live}} for her and Dermide at her brother Joseph's hotel in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Eventually, they settled in the Château de Montgobert, her husband's former estate, which was Dermide's inheritance from his father. Napoleon did not wish for Pauline to remain without a husband and, as such, Roman nobleman Camillo Borghese, 6th Prince of Sulmona was selected {{with the help of}} Pope Pius VII. Thus, on 14 November 1803, Pauline, Camillo and Dermide set out on a journey towards Rome. Dermide had his own carriage, drawn by six horses, which he shared with his governess, Madame Ducluzel, and with his mother's lectrice (reader), Jenny Saint-Maur. In one of the cities through which <b>they</b> <b>passed,</b> <b>a</b> [...] asked the family who they were, upon which Dermide replied, [...] "Messieurs, it is the son of General Leclerc traveling with his suite." [...] Saint-Maur swiftly corrected him, albeit [...] "admiring his spirit". The family took up residence at the Palazzo Borghese in Rome.|$|E
500|$|Apart from study, Thielsen and {{the rest}} of the Crater Lake area {{features}} heavily into 19th- and early 20th-century exploration. In 1853, miners from Yreka first described Crater Lake; one called it [...] "the bluest water he had ever seen", another [...] "Deep Blue Lake." [...] The first published description was written by Chauncy Nye for the Jacksonville Sentinel in 1862. Nye recalled an expedition of gold prospectors where <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> lake of a deep blue color. Native Americans lived in the area and grew irritable towards new settlers in the area. In 1865, Fort Klamath was built as a protective sanctuary. A wagon road was built to connect the Rogue Valley to the building. In late 1865, two hunters ventured upon the lake; more explorers followed. By then, the lake became famous for its distinctive color, and crowds flocked to see it. The first non-Native American to stand on the shore of Crater Lake was Sergeant Orsen Stearns, who climbed down into the caldera. A friend, Captain F.B. Sprague, gave it the name [...] "Lake Majesty." [...] Tourism continued until May22, 1902; on that day, Theodore Roosevelt designated the lake and surrounding area a national park.|$|E
500|$|The colonial mission, led by future {{governor}} Simon Bradstreet and pastor John Norton, was successful, and King Charles {{announced that}} he would renew the colonial charter, provided the colony allowed the Church of England to practice there. The Endecott administration dragged its feet on implementation, and after months of inaction, the king sent a commission headed by Samuel Maverick, one of the colony's most vocal critics, to investigate. Endecott had advance warning of what the commission was to investigate, and took steps to address in form, if not in substance, some of the expected actions. Charles insisted that all religious dissenters be freed, which Endecott had done long before Maverick's arrival, but he did so by deporting them. Upon the commissioners' arrival, the assembly took up the matter of allowing Church of England activity in the colony. <b>They</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> law deliberately using the king's language, allowing anyone [...] "orthodox in religion" [...] to practice in the colony; however, they also defined such orthodoxy as consisting of views that were acceptable to local ministers. This effectively negated the law, because there were probably no ministers in the colony who would agree that Anglicans satisfied their idea of orthodoxy.|$|E

Warwick was {{with him as he}} threw up his cap and [...] "so laughed that the tears ran down his cheeks for grief." [...] The city that had welcomed the Duke splendidly was nervous to please the new queen. A large group of townsmen and university scholars surrounded King's College to arrest the Duke, who was with his son lodged on the premises. In contrast to his father, Warwick resisted arrest. A letter from the Council arrived that everyman could go his way, so the Duke asked to be set free, [...] "and so continued they all night [...] ". At dawn the Earl of Warwick [...] "was booted ready to have ridden in the morning", and escape. It was too late, however, as the Earl of Arundel arrived to again arrest the Duke and his entourage. The prisoners returned riding side by side through London, the guards having difficulties protecting them against the hostile populace.|$|E
500|$|The {{elections}} of 1878 returned {{control of both}} houses of Congress to the Democrats {{for the first time}} since before the Civil War. [...] The new Democratic majority passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race and allowed the use of federal troops to supervise elections. [...] Bayard supported the effort, which passed both houses and sent to the President. [...] Hayes was determined to preserve the law to protect black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. [...] Bayard spoke in favor of the bill, believing the time had come to end the military's involvement in Southern politics. [...] The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but <b>they</b> <b>passed</b> <b>a</b> new bill with the same rider. [...] Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. [...] Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Force Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were cut off.|$|E
