5|$|By 1854, Hindman {{realized}} that he had little room to maneuver in the crowded Mississippi political arena. Looking across the Mississippi River, Hindman observed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> and turbulent state of Arkansas was wide open for a well-educated and ambitious politician. Hindman left Mississippi politics when he moved to Helena, Arkansas on March 18, 1854.|$|E
5|$|Paul Phaneuf {{maintained}} a backyard rink each winter <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Phaneuf practised on. His mother, a former figure skater who competed for Prince Edward Island at the 1975 Canada Winter Games, {{taught him to}} skate. Phaneuf also practised his shot relentlessly {{in the basement of}} his family's home, frequently breaking the nets his father bought.|$|E
5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain {{within a particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led to}} genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E

5|$|At his 1st dan judo examination, Abbe {{had caught}} the {{attention}} of Shotaro Tobata from the Butoku Kai, who had been refereeing at the event. Tobata had suggested to Nakamoto and Abbe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man should apply for entry to the renowned Budo Senmon Gakko (abbreviated to 'Busen,' and sometimes referred to as 'Busen College'), a specialist college for martial artists. With the additional help of a teacher named Nakano, Abbe now prepared for the entrance examination in Kyoto. Out of all the candidates, of which there were around 300 that year, 20 would be accepted into the judo programme and 20 into the kendo programme. Abbe performed well and was accepted into both programmes.|$|E
5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} Albany, the ship {{carrying}} Montgomery up the Hudson River ran aground near Clermont Manor, {{seat of the}} politically powerful Livingston family. While the ship was refloated, the Livingstons played host to the officers who were aboard the vessel. Montgomery was at this time introduced to Robert Livingston's 20-year-old daughter Janet. While it has never transpired exactly what happened between them at this time, Janet noticed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Montgomery was not with the regiment (having been given leave to return to England early) when it returned to New York.|$|E

40|$|Several {{straight}} hetero-junctions carbon nanotubes (CNTs) {{are constructed}} and their tensile behavior are investigated. It is pointed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Young's</b> modulus of hetero-junctions {{is lower than}} the values of their fundamental homogeneous CNTs due to the existence of pentagon–heptagon pair defects. In addition, it is revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Young's</b> modulus of homogeneous zigzag CNTs increases by increasing the chiral number of these nano-structures. Finally, it is concluded <b>that</b> as <b>the</b> connecting length of the hetero-junctions increases <b>the</b> <b>Young's</b> modulus of these particular CNTs decreases. Therefore, the tensile strength of hetero-junctions depends on the presence of pentagon–heptagon pair defects...|$|R
5|$|Feeding {{is usually}} {{in small groups}} and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in March, with the birds {{building}} their nest high in an acacia tree. The birds usually lay five to six cream eggs with lilac blotches. The nest itself is globular in shape with a tubular entrance on top. It is possible that {{more than just the}} breeding pair visit the nest and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of the troodonts Mei and Sinornithoides {{demonstrate}} that some dinosaurs slept {{with their heads}} tucked under their arms. This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds. Several deinonychosaur and oviraptorosaur specimens have also been found preserved {{on top of their}} nests, likely brooding in a bird-like manner. The ratio between egg volume and body mass of adults among these dinosaurs suggest that the eggs were primarily brooded by the male, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> were highly precocial, similar to many modern ground-dwelling birds.|$|E
5|$|Gielgud's first {{substantial}} engagement {{came through}} his family. In 1922 his cousin Phyllis Neilson-Terry {{invited him to}} tour in J.B. Fagan's The Wheel, as understudy, bit-part player and assistant stage manager, an invitation he accepted. A colleague, recognising <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man had talent but lacked technique, recommended him to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). Gielgud was awarded a scholarship to the academy and trained there throughout 1923 under Kenneth Barnes, Helen Haye and Claude Rains.|$|E

5|$|He {{moved to}} Bucharest {{at the age}} of eleven, and {{attended}} the Schemitz-Tierin boarding school. It is believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Tzara completed his secondary education at a state-run high school, which is identified as the Saint Sava National College or as the Sfântul Gheorghe High School. In October 1912, when Tzara was aged sixteen, he joined his friends Vinea and Marcel Janco in editing Simbolul. Reputedly, Janco and Vinea provided the funds. Like Vinea, Tzara was also close to their young colleague Jacques G. Costin, who was later his self-declared promoter and admirer.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 472 BC, Pericles {{presented}} The Persians of Aeschylus at the Greater Dionysia as a liturgy, demonstrating {{that he was one}} of the wealthier men of Athens. Simon Hornblower has argued that Pericles' selection of this play, which presents a nostalgic picture of Themistocles' famous victory at Salamis, shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> politician was supporting Themistocles against his political opponent Cimon, whose faction succeeded in having Themistocles ostracized shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The History of Animals {{contains}} many accurate eye-witness observations, in particular {{of the marine}} biology around the island of Lesbos, such as that the octopus had colour-changing abilities and a sperm-transferring tentacle, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> of a dogfish grow inside their mother's body, or that the male of a river catfish guards the eggs after the female has left. Some of these were long considered fanciful before being rediscovered in the nineteenth century. Aristotle {{has been accused of}} making errors, but some are due to misinterpretation of his text, and others may have been based on genuine observation. He did however make somewhat uncritical use of evidence from other people, such as travellers and beekeepers.|$|E

50|$|According to Plutarch, Dionysius the Elder had dreaded {{that anyone}} might depose him treacherously. He had, therefore, cloistered his son inside the Syracusan acropolis so, {{as he grew}} up, he lacked the knowledge, capabilities, {{political}} skills or personal strength expected of a future leader of men. As an adult, Plutarch states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> Dionysius was given to libertine practices. Cornelius Nepos was of <b>the</b> view <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> Dionysius lacked his father’s strength of character and he paid {{too much attention to}} unscrupulous advisers who wished to discredit Dion.|$|R
5|$|The new Queen of Hungary {{subjected}} herself {{entirely to}} her controlling mother-in-law, Elizabeth of Poland. The fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> queen's retinue {{consisted of the}} same individuals who had served the queen mother indicates that Elizabeth of Bosnia may not even have had her own court. Her mother-in-law's influence prevailed until 1370, when Louis succeeded his maternal uncle, CasimirIII, as King of Poland. Elizabeth's maternal uncle, Vladislaus the White, had also been {{a candidate for the}} Polish throne. Following his coronation in Poland, Louis brought Casimir's underage daughters, Anne and Hedwig, to be raised by Elizabeth. Elizabeth, though Queen of Poland, was never crowned as such.|$|E
5|$|The story <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Bradman practised {{alone with}} a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore. Bradman's {{meteoric}} rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years. Before his 22nd birthday, he had set many records for top scoring, some of which still stand, and became Australia's sporting idol {{at the height of}} the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Brundage {{began work}} as a {{construction}} superintendent for the leading architectural firm of Holabird & Roche. In the three years {{he worked for the}} firm, he supervised the construction of $7.5million in buildings—3percent of the total built in Chicago in that time-frame. He disliked the corruption of the Chicago building trades. Brundage's biographer, Allen Guttmann, points out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> engineer {{was in a position to}} benefit from influence if he had wanted to, as his uncle, Edward J. Brundage, was by then Republican leader of Chicago's North Side and would become Attorney General of Illinois. Brundage had been successful in a number of track and field events while at Illinois. In 1910, as a member of the Chicago Athletic Association (CAA), he finished third in the national all-around championships (an American predecessor of the decathlon), sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and continued training, aiming at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.|$|E

5|$|As a boy, Jinnah {{lived for}} a time in Bombay with an aunt and may have {{attended}} the Gokal Das Tej Primary School there, later on studying at the Cathedral and John Connon School. In Karachi, he attended the Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam and the Christian Missionary Society High School. He gained his matriculation from Bombay University at the high school. In his later years and especially after his death, a large number of stories about the boyhood of Pakistan's founder were circulated: that he spent all his spare time at the police court, listening to the proceedings, and that he studied his books by the glow of street lights for lack of other illumination. His official biographer, Hector Bolitho, writing in 1954, interviewed surviving boyhood associates, and obtained a tale <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Jinnah discouraged other children from playing marbles in the dust, urging them to rise up, keep their hands and clothes clean, and play cricket instead.|$|E
5|$|Count Geoffrey died in 1151 before finalizing the {{division}} of his realm between Henry and Henry's younger brother Geoffrey, who would have inherited Anjou. According to William of Newburgh, who wrote in the 1190s, Count Geoffrey decided that Henry would receive England and Anjou {{for as long as}} he needed the resources for the conflict against Stephen. Count Geoffrey instructed that his body should not be buried until Henry swore an oath <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Geoffrey would receive Anjou when England and Normandy were secured. W. L. Warren cast doubt on this account on the grounds that it was written later based on a single contemporary source, it would be questionable that either Geoffrey or Henry would consider such an oath binding and it would break the inheritance practice of the time. The young Geoffrey died in 1158, before receiving Anjou, but he had become count of Nantes when the citizens of Nantes rebelled against their ruler. Henry had supported the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Custine's son, Renaud-Louis-Philippe-Francois, (b. in Paris in 1768 {{and died}} 3 January 1794), also called Armand, was a captain {{in one of}} the regiments in the Army of the Rhine. As a young man, he had {{traveled}} widely, and made a long study of the art of war in Berlin. Comte de Mirabeau, ever the politician, predicted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Custine would become a well-respected diplomat. By 1792, Armand was Nicholas Luckner's aide-de-camp; following Luckner's dismissal, he entered a brief embassy duty in Berlin in 1792 as chargé de affaires and eventually, as diplomatic relations between France and the rest of Europe became strained, he was a hostage for the safe return of Prussian and Austrian diplomats in Paris. His deceased mother had left him capital of 700,000 livres, making him a wealthy young man; it was assumed that his father would also settle a suitable amount on him upon his marriage as well as the family estates in Niderviller, which included six farms.|$|E
