5|$|The Great New York City Fire of 1845 {{broke out}} on July 19, 1845. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started</b> in a whale oil and candle {{manufacturing}} establishment and quickly {{spread to other}} wooden structures in New York City the neighborhood. It reached a warehouse on Broad Street where combustible saltpeter was stored and caused a massive explosion that spread the fire even farther.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started</b> {{at about}} 2:30 a.m. on Saturday, July 19, 1845, {{on the third}} floor of J. L. Van Doren, Oil Merchant and Stearin Candle Manufacturer, known as a seller of whale oil, at 34 New Street in Manhattan, and spread quickly to {{adjoining}} buildings. The City Hall alarm bell began to ring at about 3:00 a.m., summoning firefighters.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{remoteness}} and inaccessibility of a {{large number}} of <b>fires,</b> rainfall after <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> <b>started</b> was not enough to extinguish them and was also hindering firefighters.|$|R
50|$|The {{explosives}} manufactured at Hercules {{played a}} significant and decisive role in the United States Army's efforts to contain <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> <b>started</b> by <b>the</b> 1906 San Francisco earthquake, as recounted by General Funston.|$|R

5|$|The {{death toll}} is unknown but {{traditionally}} {{thought to have}} been small, as only six verified deaths were recorded. This reasoning has recently been challenged {{on the grounds that the}} deaths of poor and middle-class people were not recorded, while the heat of the fire may have cremated many victims, leaving no recognisable remains. A melted piece of pottery on display at the Museum of London found by archaeologists in Pudding Lane, where <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started,</b> shows that the temperature reached 1250 °C.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{began at}} 2:15pm local time (06:15 UTC) around the tenth floor. The building, {{constructed}} in 1997, was {{located at the}} intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Yuyao Road in Shanghai's Jing'an District, and was being renovated {{at the time of the}} fire. Witnesses said that <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started</b> with construction materials and spread throughout the building. It took over 80 fire engines and several hours to contain the fire. Shanghai residents were able to see smoke from the fire several kilometres away. Firefighters were unable to hose water on the top of the -tall building from the ground.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the urge to {{identify}} scapegoats for the fire is {{the acceptance of the}} confession of a simple-minded French watchmaker named Robert Hubert, who claimed that he was an agent of the Pope and had started the Great Fire in Westminster. He later changed his story to say that he had started the fire at the bakery in Pudding Lane. Hubert was convicted, despite some misgivings about his fitness to plead, and hanged at Tyburn on 28 September 1666. After his death, it became apparent that he had been on board a ship in the North Sea, and had not arrived in London until two days after <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started.</b> These allegations that Catholics had started the fire were exploited as powerful political propaganda by opponents of pro-Catholic Charles II's court, mostly during the Popish Plot and the exclusion crisis later in his reign.|$|E

30|$|When <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>starts,</b> <b>the</b> victim—whether {{conscious}} or not—will quickly inhale {{smoke and}} soot from <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> that will deposit {{in the deep}} respiratory tract and the oesophagus.

25|$|The former Minister for Public Order, Vyron Polydoras, stated <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> may be {{a result}} of {{terrorist}} attacks, as many of <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> <b>started</b> simultaneously and in places where an arsonist could not be seen. He also stated that the country is facing an asymmetric threat, a military term used for terrorist attacks.|$|R
5|$|On April 25, 1935 at 6:43pm, a {{custodial}} engineer {{called the}} Salem Fire Department to report smoke. Citizens helped to remove {{items from the}} smoky building, but when firefighters arrived, they ordered everyone to leave the structure, which was soon engulfed in flame. Among the helping citizens was twelve-year-old Mark Hatfield, who later became governor. It was determined <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started</b> {{in the basement of}} the east wing and quickly spread to piles of old records. A strong updraft in the hollow columns enclosing the dome's eight supporting steel lattice girders pulled the flames through the rotunda to upper stories. The intense heat burned even the copper dome and lit the night sky.|$|E
5|$|Parma made {{no effort}} to {{restrain}} his soldiers. On their rampage through the city, Italian and Spanish soldiers slaughtered the rest of the garrison, even the men who tried to surrender. Once their blood-lust was satiated, they began to plunder. Civilians who had taken refuge in the churches were initially ignored, but when <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started,</b> they were forced into the streets and trapped by the rampaging soldiers. Contemporary accounts refer to children, women, and old men, their clothes smoldering, or in flames, trying to escape the conflagration, only to be trapped by the enraged Spanish; if they escaped the flames and the Spanish, they were cornered by the enraged Italians. Parma wrote to King Philip that over 4000lay dead in the ditches (moats). English observers confirmed this report, and elaborated that only eight buildings remained standing.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started</b> on August 17, 2013 at 3:25pm in the Stanislaus National Forest, east of Groveland, when {{a hunter}} {{lost control of}} an illegal campfire. The hunter was not {{identified}} publicly until a year later, when two felony, and two misdemeanor charges were filed against Keith Matthew Emerald of Columbia, California. The fire had only burned 40 acres when it was discovered, but it grew to 10,000 acres within 36 hours and 100,000 acres after just four days. In two days, in mid-August, the fire burned nearly 90,000 acres. The fire's rapid spread was attributed to drought and extreme weather conditions. It burned into backcountry areas of Yosemite National Park. The park remained open, and though Yosemite Valley was never in danger, the fire did burn 78,895 acres of parkland. Heavy smoke was, at times, a factor.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>fires,</b> <b>started</b> by {{lightning}} strikes, {{might have been}} contained, had they been attacked more aggressively in the 24 hours after they broke out. Large stretches of dry, drought-affected vegetation and weather conditions that were extremely conducive to fire meant that once <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> reached a certain size, they were very difficult to control.|$|R
50|$|When General Grant's forces {{broke through}} Richmond's defenses, Jefferson Davis ordered the {{destruction}} of Richmond's militarily significant supplies; the resulting conflagration destroyed many - mainly commercial - buildings and some Southern warships docked on the James River. Civilians in panic were forced to escape <b>the</b> <b>fires</b> <b>started</b> by <b>the</b> Confederates.|$|R
50|$|However, HE {{concentrations}} against specific targets {{became more}} common and gradually replaced the barrage. With a concentration <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>starts</b> when attacking forces become {{vulnerable to the}} target and lifts off the target when the attacking forces reach an agreed distance from it. The suppressive effect lingers for a short period, about 2 minutes, after <b>the</b> artillery <b>fire</b> stops.|$|R
5|$|While {{the human}} and {{property}} losses were staggering, the cultural loss is still felt today. The University of Copenhagen library was without a doubt the greatest and the most frequently mentioned of such. 35,000texts and a large archive of historical documents disappeared in the flames. Original works from the historians Hans Svaning, Anders Sørensen Vedel, Niels Krag, and Arild Huitfeldt and the scientists Ole Worm, Ole Rømer, Tycho Brahe and the brothers Hans and Caspar Bartholin were lost. Atlas Danicus by Peder Hansen Resen and the archive of Zealand Diocese went up in flames as well. The archive of the diocese had been moved to the university library the very same day <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started.</b>|$|E
5|$|Within {{the diocese}} of Constance, Bernhardin Sanson was {{offering}} a special indulgence for contributors to the building of St Peter's in Rome. When Sanson arrived {{at the gates of}} Zurich at the end of January 1519, parishioners prompted Zwingli with questions. He responded with displeasure that the people were not being properly informed about the conditions of the indulgence and were being induced to part with their money on false pretences. This was over a year after Martin Luther published his Ninety-five theses (31 October 1517). The council of Zurich refused Sanson entry into the city. As the authorities in Rome were anxious to contain <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started</b> by Luther, the Bishop of Constance denied any support of Sanson and he was recalled.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of owner Charles van Raalte in 1907, his wife Florence stayed on Brownsea until 1925. Mary Bonham-Christie bought the island at an auction in 1927. In 1932, Bonham-Christie allowed 500 Scouts to camp there to {{celebrate}} the Silver Jubilee of Scouting, but shortly afterwards she closed the island {{to the public and}} it became very overgrown. In 1934, some Sea Scouts were camping on the island when a fire broke out. Mrs. Bonham-Christie blamed the Sea Scouts, although the fire did not start where the Sea Scouts were camping. The fire engulfed most of the island, burning west to east. The eastern buildings were only saved by a subsequent change in wind direction. Although it was not known how <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started,</b> Scouts were not allowed to camp on the island again until after Bonham-Christie's death in 1961. Her family becoming liable for inheritance tax on her estate, they put the island up for sale. Interested citizens who feared that the island would be bought by developers helped raise an endowment, and in 1962 the government allowed the National Trust to take over management of the island in lieu of the death duties.|$|E

5|$|On September 20, 2003, the {{original}} {{wing of the}} Briarcliff Lodge caught fire. The owner, Barrington Venture, had planned to raze the 100-year-old building and construct a 385-unit senior living center, which was opposed by local historians and architects. The fire thus ended the preservation effort. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started</b> near the main entrance and was suppressed by mid-day; it was deemed suspicious by fire officials.

The Briarcliff Manor Fire Department {{was the first to}} arrive, at 6:40 am, later followed by Ossining, Sleepy Hollow, Millwood, Pleasantville, Chappaqua, Croton, and Pocantico Hills, totaling about 150 firefighters. The fire also spread to the lodge's 9-story west wing, through its wooden attic even though a concrete block firewall stood between both sections. The fire departments contained the fire to prevent it from spreading north or to the village water tower, and therefore saved the water tower and village and commercial radio antennae. After the fire, Westchester County's Cause & Origin Team sent an arson investigative unit, which sifted through the debris along with trained dogs, and found no evidence of arson. Contemporary portions of the lodge and other campus buildings were later demolished.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 1985, one of {{the worst}} {{sporting}} disasters occurred at Valley Parade, 56 people died and at least 265 were injured when the main stand was engulfed by fire. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started</b> 40minutes into the club's final game of the 1984–85 season against Lincoln City and destroyed the main stand in just nine minutes. For the next season and the first five months of the 1986–87 season, Bradford City played home games at Leeds United's Elland Road, Huddersfield Town's Leeds Road and Bradford Northern's Odsal Stadium, while Valley Parade was rebuilt. Huddersfield-based firm J Wimpenny carried out the £2.6million work, which included funding from insurance pay-outs, Football League stadium grants, club funds and a £1.46million Government loan obtained by two Bradford MPs, Geoffrey Lawler and Max Madden. A new 5,000 all-seater main stand was built, longer than the structure which had burned down. The Kop was also covered {{for the first time and}} increased to a 7,000 capacity. Other minor work was carried out to the ground's other two stands. On 14 December 1986, 582days after the fire, The Hon Sir Oliver Popplewell, who had conducted the inquiry into the fire, opened the new stadium before an exhibition match against an England international XI. It was first used for a league game on Boxing Day when City lost 1–0 to Derby County.|$|E
5|$|The flood made {{national}} news. The {{most familiar}} footage is possibly {{of the fire}} that started on April 19 in downtown Grand Forks, surrounded by floodwaters, where eleven buildings and sixty apartments were destroyed. The Grand Forks Herald building was totally destroyed in the fire, along with 120 years of archives. Firefighters {{were not able to}} begin extinguishing the fire immediately as they had to evacuate nearly forty people in one of the nearby apartment complexes who had defied the evacuation order. Additionally, their tankers were unable to reach the buildings due to the height of the floodwater and the water pressure from the hoses and fire hydrants was too weak to extinguish the flames. The National Guard placed the fire trucks on several tractor-trailers to prevent them from flooding, which allowed the firefighters to assist in extinguishing the fire. Also, two aircraft rescue and firefighting trucks from the Grand Forks International Airport were brought in to fight the fire because their engines were higher up off the ground, and thus did not get clogged by the flood waters. The firefighters received assistance several hours after <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started</b> by a fire-bombing plane that dropped retardant and helicopters who made sixty drops totaling 120,000 gallons of water. Three of the firefighters were treated for hypothermia after treading through the cold temperatures of the flood water. The fire was later determined to have been caused by an electrical problem that had resulted from the large amounts of floodwater.|$|E

5|$|The largest fire in {{the park}} was the North Fork fire, {{both in terms of}} damage to {{structures}} and of area burned. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started</b> on July 22 when a man cutting timber dropped his cigarette in Caribou-Targhee National Forest just outside the park's western border. The North Fork fire was the only major fire that was fought from the beginning since it started after the prescribed fire policy was halted on July 15. The fire spread towards the northeast {{and by the end of}} the first week of August was threatening Madison Junction and nearby campground facilities. The fire then raced towards Norris Junction on August 20. Firefighters there used water and foam to keep the structures from being consumed by the blaze. The fire continued its eastward advance along the Yellowstone Plateau and on August 25 reached visitor facilities at Canyon, where land management agencies and the U.S. military put forth enormous efforts to protect structures. The eastern flank of the fire calmed down for several days, then down-sloping winds off the Yellowstone Plateau forced flames along the west side of the fire towards the town of West Yellowstone, Montana. There, private citizens assisted assigned personnel in soaking hundreds of acres of forestland to protect both the town and an electrical power substation. The fire burned a substantial section of forest along the Madison River valley.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} 1902 Briarcliff Lodge building {{burned to}} the ground on September 20, 2003. The building was scheduled for demolition within 18 months (they had applied for demolition permits the week before the fire). The owner, Barrington Venture, had planned to raze the building and construct the Garlands, a 385-unit senior living center, which was opposed by local historians and architects. The fire thus ended the preservation effort. <b>The</b> <b>fire</b> <b>started</b> near the main entrance and was suppressed by mid-day; it was deemed suspicious by fire officials, including Briarcliff's fire chief.

The north wing was damaged but still standing. After the fire, Westchester County's Cause & Origin Team sent an arson investigative unit, which sifted through the debris along with trained dogs, and found no evidence of arson.
