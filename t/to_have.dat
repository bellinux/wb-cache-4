5|$|All {{meitnerium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known meitnerium isotope, 278Mt, is also the heaviest known; it has a half-life of 7.6seconds. (The unconfirmed 282Mt is yet heavier and appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an even longer half-life of 67seconds.) A metastable nuclear isomer, 270mMt, {{has been reported to}} also have a half-life of over a second. The isotopes 276Mt and 274Mt have half-lives of 0.72 and 0.44seconds respectively. The remaining four isotopes have half-lives between 1 and 20milliseconds. The undiscovered isotope 281Mt has been predicted to be the most stable towards beta decay; no known meitnerium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. Some unknown isotopes, such as 265Mt, 272Mt, 273Mt, and 279Mt, are predicted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> half-lives longer than the known isotopes. Before its discovery, 274Mt and 277Mt were predicted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> half-lives of 20seconds and 1minute respectively, but they were later found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> half-lives of only 0.44seconds and 5milliseconds respectively.|$|E
5|$|All {{roentgenium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, the heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known roentgenium isotope, 282Rg, is also the heaviest known roentgenium isotope; it has a half-life of 2.1minutes. (The unconfirmed 286Rg is even heavier and appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an even longer half-life of about 11minutes, {{which would make it}} one of the longest-lived superheavy nuclides known.) The isotopes 280Rg and 281Rg have also been reported <b>to</b> <b>have</b> half-lives over a second. The remaining isotopes have half-lives in the millisecond range. The undiscovered isotope 287Rg has been predicted to be the most stable towards beta decay; however, no known roentgenium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. The unknown isotopes 277Rg and 283Rg are also expected <b>to</b> <b>have</b> long half-lives of 1second and 10minutes respectively. Before their discovery, the isotopes 278Rg, 281Rg, and 282Rg were predicted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> long half-lives of 1second, 1minute, and 4minutes respectively; however, they were discovered <b>to</b> <b>have</b> shorter half-lives of 4.2milliseconds, 17seconds, and 2.1minutes respectively.|$|E

5|$|Ankylosaurus is {{a member}} of the family Ankylosauridae, and its closest {{relatives}} appear to be Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus. Ankylosaurus is thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a slow moving animal, able to make quick movements when necessary. Its broad muzzle indicates it was a non-selective browser. Sinuses and nasal chambers in the snout may have been for heat and water balance, or may have played a role in vocalization. The tail club is thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been used in defense against predators or in intraspecific combat. Ankylosaurus has been found in the Hell Creek, Lance, and Scollard formations, but appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been rare in its environment. Although it lived alongside a nodosaurid ankylosaur, their ranges and ecological niches do not appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> overlapped, and Ankylosaurus may have inhabited upland areas. Ankylosaurus also lived alongside dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, and Edmontosaurus.|$|E
