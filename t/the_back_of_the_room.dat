5|$|Hattie McDaniel {{became the}} first African-American to win an Academy Award—beating out her co-star Olivia de Havilland who was also {{nominated}} in the same category—but was racially segregated from her co-stars at the awards ceremony at the Coconut Grove; she and her escort were made to sit at a separate table at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Meanwhile, screenwriter Sidney Howard {{became the first}} posthumous Oscar winner and Selznick personally received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his career achievements.|$|E
5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In {{is modeled}} after a 1950s {{drive-in}} theater. The entrance {{is made to}} look like a box office, and guests can walk from there along a tall fence to the dining room, where they sit at formica countertops in booths {{made to look like}} convertibles from the 1940s and 1950s. These booths were designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and are made of fiberglass with much chrome plating. The cars have whitewall tires, and speakers are mounted on poles next to each car. The license plates are dated from 1955, and each convertible seats four people, although these mock vehicles were initially six-seaters when the restaurant first opened. There are six picnic tables near <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> that are only used {{when the rest of the}} restaurant is full and there are guests who are willing to forego the experience of sitting in the cars. All guests who make reservations are seated in the cars, although this was not the case the year the restaurant first opened. The restaurant has a total seating capacity of 260.|$|E
25|$|Sun Ra {{became a}} fixture in Philadelphia, {{appearing}} semi-regularly on WXPN radio, giving lectures to community groups, or visiting the city's libraries. In the mid-1970s, the Arkestra sometimes played free Saturday afternoon concerts in a Germantown park near their home. At their mid-1970s shows in Philadelphia nightclubs, someone stood at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> selling stacks of unmarked LPs in plain white sleeves, pressed from recordings of the band's live performances.|$|E

25|$|According to {{accounts}} of the following event reported by Glenn Boyer in I Married Wyatt Earp, Earp had run two cowboys, Tobe Driscall and Ed Morrison, out of Wichita earlier in 1878. During the summer, the two cowboys—accompanied by another two dozen men—rode into Dodge and shot up the town while galloping down Front Street. They entered the Long Branch Saloon, vandalized the room, and harassed the customers. Hearing the commotion, Earp burst through the front door, and before he could react, {{a large number of}} cowboys were pointing their guns at him. In another version, there were only three to five cowboys. In both stories, Holliday was playing cards in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and upon seeing the commotion, drew his weapon and put his pistol at Morrison's head, forcing him and his men to disarm, rescuing Earp from a bad situation. No account of any such confrontation was reported by any of the Dodge City newspapers at the time. Whatever actually happened, Earp credited Holliday with saving his life that day, and the two men became friends.|$|E
500|$|Some of the servers at the Sci-Fi Dine-In wear roller skates, {{acting as}} carhops, while others improvise {{characters}} {{such as a}} police officer ostensibly in search of people who have sneaked into the theater without paying.

There is the facade of a snack counter at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> behind which is the kitchen.

500|$|At {{the first}} Clinical Nursing Conference on AIDS, in Washington, D.C., on October 7, 1983, Campbell {{presented}} a poster session, [...] "dressed for the part" [...] in white {{pants and a}} lab coat. The poster session was designed to help clinicians and nurses understand {{the message of the}} Denver Principles, about respect for people with AIDS, rather than considering them as [...] "victims." [...] While at the conference, he attended a talk by an infection control nurse at the National Institutes of Health where he discovered the agency's [...] "maximum awareness" [...] policy recommended the use of electric green [...] "AIDS Precaution" [...] tags on AIDS patients' rooms, blood tubes and laundry. With Artie Felson, he shouted his disgust at the [...] "creepy" [...] policy from <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and arranged an impromptu meeting of the National Association of People With AIDS, where they decided to pay visit to Heckler at her Bethesda office. They spoke with Shelley Lengel, a spokesperson for the new National AIDS Helpline, however Lengel did not call them back with further information about the policy.|$|E

500|$|John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer were virtual unknowns {{before being}} cast in their {{respective}} roles as Jim and Pam, the central love interests. Krasinski had attended school with, and {{was a friend of}} B. J. Novak. Krasinski recalled accidentally insulting Greg Daniels while waiting to audition for the series, telling him, [...] "I hope [...] don't screw this up." [...] Daniels then introduced himself and told Krasinski who he was. Fischer prepared for her audition by looking as boring as possible, creating the original Pam hairstyle. In an interview on NPR's Fresh Air, Fischer recalled the last stages of the audition process for Pam and Jim, with the producers partnering the different potential Pams and Jims (four of each) together to gauge their chemistry. When Fischer finished her scene with Krasinski, he told her that she was his favorite Pam, to which she reciprocated that he was her favorite Jim. Many actors originally filmed as extras in this episode would later go on to become supporting cast members in later episodes, and the two women wearing blue sweaters towards <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> at the staff meeting scene were actual accountants that worked on the production staff.|$|E
500|$|Inside the {{underground}} {{part of the}} Orchid station, Ben puts every metal item he can find into a small compartment at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> while Locke watches the orientation video for the Orchid. On the tape, Pierre Chang (François Chau) begins to discuss time travel involving [...] "negatively charged exotic matter" [...] when the VCR malfunctions and the tape rewinds itself. Shortly, Keamy arrives and tells Locke that if he (Keamy) dies, the C4 on the freighter will detonate, due to a remote trigger linked to a heart rate monitor he is wearing. Regardless, Ben kills Keamy with no remorse or sympathy for those on the boat, in order to avenge his adopted daughter Alex (Tania Raymonde), whom Keamy executed. Ben seals and then activates power to the compartment he had loaded with metal items, blowing {{a hole in the}} back of it. Ben, now wearing a parka, tells Locke that whoever moves the island is forced to leave it and never come back; Ben must do it so that Locke can stay and lead the Others. Locke then goes to the Others, who welcome him home. Ben climbs through the hole and down a rocky tunnel beyond it into a frozen chamber, cutting his arm in the process. [...] He then turns a very large metal wheel. As he completes the rotation, an eerie sound and white-yellow light soon envelop the entire island. Ben disappears, only to reappear several months later in the Sahara Desert (as seen in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come").|$|E
500|$|Other, less obvious, {{elements}} of the painting reveal more about the poet's personality and ideas. The poem he is attempting to write is entitled [...] "Upon Riches", {{which suggests that the}} poet lives in a fantasy world, while his wife and child go hungry. Ned Ward's first published poem in 1691 was The Poet's Ramble After Riches, which satirised his own struggles as an impoverished aspiring poet, and Hogarth may have had this in mind when he produced the picture. Earlier impressions showed the poem as [...] "Poverty, A Poem", which hinted at a connection to Theobald who had written [...] "The Cave of Poverty, A Poem, Written in Imitation of Shakespeare" [...] in 1714. The poet's dreams of riches are further suggested by the map that hangs over his head, entitled [...] "A View of the Gold Mines of Peru", replacing the image of Pope that appears in the earlier states of the print. The poet's self-interest is hinted by the presence of his pipe and tobacco on the window sill, the mug of beer sitting on the chair in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> the lace cuffs drying by the fire, his ill-fitting wig, and gentleman's sword lying at his feet; it may be that despite his family's circumstances, he refuses to forgo his own personal pleasures and effects. Alternatively, his fantasy of earning a fortune from his art may require that he keeps his gentlemanly accoutrements around him, as they will be required when his fantasies are realized.|$|E

2500|$|The Lavender Hill Mob {{also criticized}} representatives of {{established}} {{lesbian and gay}} organizations attending the meeting, interrupting their joint press conference {{on the second day}} of the meeting. Urvashi Vaid was at the podium when Petrelis stood from his seat at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and shouted, [...] "You’ve sold out the gay community!" [...] Petrelis accused the community leaders of being “really out of touch” with the gay community’s frustration and anger. “After six years there has been no action.

Having delivered her message for Clarissa she leaves and Pippa reappears eating a bun and carrying a book she has bought which she mysteriously describes as a [...] "recipe book" [...] although it strangely speaks of candles. Asked by Jeremy if she likes living at Copplestone Court, Pippa enthuses over the house and shows Jeremy a hidden door at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> which leads to a small recess.

25|$|During the 2013–14 {{season and}} 2014–15 season the Marussia F1 logo was on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shirts {{as part of}} a {{sponsorship}} deal between former Russian owner Anton Zingarevich and Russian owned Marussia F1.

2500|$|The oral {{evaluations}} {{are intended}} to also help the evaluator improve {{his or her ability}} to give constructive feedback to other Toastmasters. Learning to give feedback develops many skills, some of which include: effective listening; how to motivate, encourage and support other members; and how to develop and present a short evaluation with minimal preparation. Language is an important element of effective evaluation and so too is the structure. The structure of a Toastmaster Evaluation might be referred to as the [...] "feedback sandwich," [...] the [...] "PIP" [...] (praise, improve, praise) method, or the [...] "CRC" [...] (commend, recommend, commend) method. [...] One particularly effective technique is to couch a suggestion for improvement as a compliment, as in: [...] "You have an important and powerful message; it deserves to be heard in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] Consider increasing your volume when you give your next speech." ...|$|E
2500|$|The small medallions {{set into}} {{the frame of the}} convex mirror at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> show tiny scenes from the Passion of Christ and may {{represent}} God's promise of salvation for the figures reflected on the mirror's convex surface. Furthering the Memorial theory, all the scenes on the wife's side are of Christ's death and resurrection. Those on the husband's side concern Christ's life. The mirror itself may represent the eye of God observing the vows of the wedding. [...] A spotless mirror was also an established symbol of Mary, referring to the Holy Virgin's immaculate conception and purity. The mirror reflects two figures in the doorway, one of whom may be the painter himself. [...] In Panofsky's controversial view, the figures are shown to prove that the two witnesses required to make a wedding legal were present, and Van Eyck's signature on the wall acts as some form of actual documentation of an event at which he was himself present.|$|E
