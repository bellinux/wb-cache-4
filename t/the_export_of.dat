5|$|In the 17th century, Banagher was {{the centre}} of a flourishing woollen trade. In 1699, the impost placed on <b>the</b> <b>export</b> <b>of</b> woollen goods to England {{practically}} killed the woollen trade. At {{the outbreak of the}} American Revolutionary War in 1775, an embargo placed on <b>the</b> <b>export</b> <b>of</b> foodstuffs to the American Colonies dealt another blow to the trade of Banagher. In 1780, the British Parliament withdrew all these restrictions and Banagher's economy began to improve rapidly.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates whether <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> {{different}} products by {{the same}} firm are systematically interconnected. Using Swedish firm-registry data from 1997 - 2011, I first document that <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> firm <b>export</b> sales is skewed towards their best performing products (‘superstars’). I then use a novel instrumental variable approach to identify if the ‘superstar’ products induce more trade of non-superstar products. I find evidence that <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> low-ranked (non-star) products of a firm complement <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> a single superstar product to each destination. Extending the ‘superstar’ concept to a ‘superstar core’ of products strengthens this result (this includes the top decile of products in terms <b>of</b> <b>export</b> value). <b>The</b> results show that a 1 % increase in <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superstar product and the superstar core increases <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> non-star products by 0. 13 % and 0. 376 %. Hence, I find that <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> non-star products complements the superstar while conversely, the same complementarity is not found using low-ranked products as placebo-superstars. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} identifying a new, sizeable and systematic intra-firm-destination one-way complementarity between products that is missing in the current models of multi-product exporters...|$|R

40|$|We analyse {{the long-run}} and short-run {{relationship}} between merchandise export volume and its determinants, foreign income, relative prices and exchange rate variability, using {{the techniques of}} cointegration and error correction. The model was estimated for Irish exports and sectoral exports SITC 0 - 4 and SITC 5 - 8 to the European Union using quarterly data for the period 1979 - 1992. The sectoral classification corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> mainly indigenous Irish firms and multinationals, respectively. We find that exchange rate volatility has {{a negative effect on}} <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multinational sector but no effect on <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indigenous sector in the short run. In contrast, exchange rate volatility has no effect on <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multinational sector but a positive effect on <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indigenous sector and overall <b>exports</b> in <b>the</b> long run.

40|$|The {{present study}} has been {{conducted}} in the year 2008 to assess <b>the</b> determinants <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> in Pakistan during 1970 - 2006 using econometric techniques. Time series data ranging from 1970 to 2006 on total exports, primary commodities exports, semi-manufactures and <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> manufactured goods has been taken from Economic Survey of Pakistan (Statistical Supplement, 2006 - 07). Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test {{has been used for}} checking the stationarity of the data. Furthermore, the Johenson Co-integration test (likelihood ratio statistic) has been used to detect the long-term relationship among the series. The method of ordinary least square has been used to assess <b>the</b> determinants <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> in Pakistan. <b>The</b> results indicate that 1 % increase in <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> primary commodities brings 0. 97 % increase in total exports in Pakistan. Similarly, 1 % increase in <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> semi-manufactures leads to increase total exports by 0. 99 %. On similar pattern, 1 % increase in <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> manufactured goods leads to increase total exports by 1 %.

5|$|After 1530, it was {{the colonists}} {{themselves}} who held the keys to power, installing new governors and removing them from office. By 1534, the Spanish colony in Honduras was close to collapse. Trujillo had a population of less than two hundred; {{it was the}} only Spanish settlement in Honduras, and very little territory beyond the town itself had been conquered. The Spanish were beset by infighting, and had provoked widespread indigenous uprisings. Simultaneously, the native population had collapsed as a result of disease, mistreatment, and <b>the</b> <b>export</b> <b>of</b> large numbers to work on the sugar plantations of the Caribbean islands.|$|E
5|$|Another reason exports {{cannot be}} {{promoted}} is because in all likelihood, an underdeveloped country {{may only be}} skilled enough to promote <b>the</b> <b>export</b> <b>of</b> primary goods, say agricultural goods. However, since such commodities face inelastic demand, {{the extent to which}} they will sell in the market is limited. Although when population is at a rise, additional demand for exports may be created, Nurkse implicitly assumed that developed countries are operating at the replacement rate of population growth. For Nurkse, then, exports as a means of economic development are completely ruled out.|$|E
