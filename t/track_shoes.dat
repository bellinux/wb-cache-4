2500|$|Carl Streator is {{the protagonist}} of Lullaby. Over {{the course of the}} novel, a few {{important}} aspects of his character are revealed that play a part in his narration style and his character. Firstly, he imparts to us at the beginning of Chapter 2 that he is a journalist. Because the novel is set up as a frame story, the majority of Lullaby is written as a retelling by Streator himself. [...] This is apparent throughout the novel as he describes the people and events around him. He will often recount a person’s appearance in terms of 'the details': [...] "The details of Nash are, he’s a big guy in a white uniform. He wears high-top white <b>track</b> <b>shoes</b> and gathers his hair into a little palm tree at the crown of his head" [...] (p.25).|$|E

The first testing to equip a French tank with a radio set was carried out in the summer of 1917 with a Schneider CA, using a twelve-metre wire antenna with a range of [...] A second test with a fourteen-metre antenna on 18 August 1917 established that contact could be made with an aircraft within a distance of two kilometres provided that the tank was not moving, and it was decided to equip the command tanks of two units, AS 11 and AS 12, with an Émitteur 10ter radio set.|$|E

50|$|Grousers are {{commonly}} used on construction vehicles such as bulldozers, loaders, and excavators. Grousers may be permanently attached to, or formed as a single piece with, the <b>track</b> <b>shoe,</b> {{or they may be}} bolted onto the <b>track</b> <b>shoe</b> for ease of replacement as they become worn. While grousers are usually straight, they may have more complex shapes, including spikes and involute curves, {{depending on the type of}} terrain and the performance requirements of the vehicle. Grousers are typically made of metal, such as forged steel, and are not designed for use on paved roads. Various devices, with names such as road bands, have been developed to temporarily cover grousers/cleats in order to allow a vehicle to drive on paved roads.|$|R

The cable suspension system was superior to other tanks of the era, and it was faster than its predecessor.|$|R

50|$|The Nike Cortez {{was created}} by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight. The men first met in 1957: Bowerman was the track and field coach at the University of Oregon, and Knight competed on Bowerman's team. The two friends became {{business}} partners soon after Knight purchased a large sum of Onitsuka Tiger brand athletic shoes from Japan. The initial name of their business was Blue Ribbon Sports and was later changed to Nike in 1972. Although the business was distributing decent athletic shoes, Bowerman believed that athletes deserved a better <b>track</b> <b>shoe</b> than what was available.

5000|$|Track spikes, or just spikes, are pointed {{protrusions}} {{usually made}} of metal, ceramic or plastic that are screwed {{into the bottom}} of most track and field shoes to increase traction and minimize the likelihood of slipping.

Keirin riders, sprinters and kilo riders and some others prefer a <b>track</b> specific <b>shoe</b> to a standard cycling shoe. Riivo, Bont, DMT and Exustar offer track-specific shoes.|$|R
