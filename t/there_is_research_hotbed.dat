40|$|Objectives: <b>There</b> <b>is</b> limited <b>research</b> on <b>hot</b> flushes {{and night}} sweats {{in women with}} a {{hysterectomy}} with ovarian conservation. We aimed to describe the patterns of these symptoms in a cohort of Australian women and to investigate the relationship between distinct symptom patterns and hysterectomy status. Study design and outcome measures: Repeated-measures latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify hot flushes and night sweats symptom patterns across seven surveys (over 17 years) in the mid-cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. Multinomial logistic regression {{was used to assess}} the associations of the symptom patterns in women with a hysterectomy with ovarian conservation (n = 1129) versus women without a hysterectomy (n = 4977). Results: A higher proportion of women with a hysterectomy than of those without experienced a constant pattern of hot flushes (15 % versus 30 %) and night sweats (9 % versus 19 %). Women with a hysterectomy had higher odds of constant hot flushes versus minimal hot flushes (OR = 1. 97, 95 % CI: 1. 64, 2. 35) and constant versus minimal night sweats (OR = 2. 09, 95 % CI: 1. 70, 2. 55). Smoking, a 'lower level of education to non-professional occupation' pathway and body mass index (BMI) patterns of 'always obese' and 'increasingly obese' were also associated with a higher risk of constant symptoms. Conclusions: Women who have a hysterectomy (with ovarian conservation) have a higher risk of hot flushes and night sweats that persist over an extended period...|$|R

The {{method of}} Vector Space Model {{is one of}} the mainstream detection methods. However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> two disadvantages for it: detection speed is very slow and synonym substitution is not accurate. To solve these problems, fingerprint retrieval algorithm is introduced to improve the detection speed. A concept of replacement cost is put forward to measure the accuracy of substitution between synonyms. The result shows that this method can not only improve the detection speed but also produce a certain improvement to the accuracy of the similarity calculation...|$|R
