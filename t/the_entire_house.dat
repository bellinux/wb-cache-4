5|$|A {{landscaped}} {{park with}} lakes and statues {{was laid out}} around the house, and the drive to the house was along a semicircular avenue of trees. Sir Edward died in 1766. Sir Gregory Page-Turner, 3rd Baronet considered the house too large, so in 1767 he sought to demolish part of it to create a smaller house. This proved impossible so in 1768 he had <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>house</b> demolished.|$|E

5|$|Susan, a {{divorced}} mother, takes interest in Mike Delfino (James Denton), a plumber who has {{recently moved to}} Wisteria Lane; however, she faces competition with neighbor Edie Britt (Nicollette Sheridan), a promiscuous serial divorcée. Suspicious that Mike is spending the night with Edie, Susan enters Edie's home uninvited with the pretense of borrowing sugar.

Though wracked with guilt, Susan is relieved to learn that Mike was not the man with whom Edie was fornicating. Meanwhile, Lynette, a former career woman, is frustrated with raising four young children while her husband, Tom (Doug Savant), is constantly away on business.|$|E

The fire was put out by pumping crews from the forestry stations at Fernwood and Las Flores, aided by the Malibu Beach colony fire department.

This is {{normally}} done on Theophany, or at least during the Afterfeast, but if the parishioners are numerous, and especially if many live {{far away from the}} church, it may take some time to bless each house.

25|$|It was Hucklesby's {{dream that}} the house would become a museum that would be 'interesting {{as well as of}} an {{educational}} nature'. Unfortunately, the house itself had been neglected and suffered from dry rot, Luton council could not immediately afford the renovations. It remained empty for several years until it became a military hospital during the First World War. After the war, rooms were let to council employees with a cafe opening on the ground floor. The museum opened in 1930, having moved from the Carnegie library where it started in 1927. At first the museum displays were held in just two rooms, but over the years it has filled <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>house.</b> The museum is open Tuesdays to Saturdays from 10am to 5pm and Sundays from 1 to 5pm.

25|$|Detective Tom (Sean Patrick Flanery) and {{his partner}} Ryan Alba (Greg Serano) {{have spent the last}} three years unsuccessfully trying to locate the Lion (Joe Pantoliano), an {{international}} hitman that has always eluded their grasp. They believe that they've found his location via a tipster but instead find Tom’s wife Kelly (Michelle Greathouse) tied up in a basement filled with explosives, surrounded by a black outline. The Lion calls Tom and commands him to kill Kelly or risk <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>house</b> blowing up and killing everyone inside. Any attempt to evacuate the house or rescue Kelly will result in everyone getting blown up and the Lion will not accept any substitutions, as he wants Tom to suffer for messing up the Lion's network in the Southwestern United States. His only mercy is that Tom may turn out the lights in the basement. With no other option, Tom has the lights turned off and he shoots and kills Kelly.|$|E
50|$|The {{layout of}} <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>housing</b> society was well-designed with green parks, open spaces, schools and {{commercial}} centre. The teachers built their {{houses on the}} plots of land leased to them, generally by taking loans from the government or banks. By 1982, a healthy percentage of residents started settling in. During those days, there was scarcity of water and people used to get water from the nearby Rani Bagh market.|$|R
50|$|So squalid {{were the}} {{conditions}} of the Hollow, in fact, that in 1956 the city declared <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> neighborhood a health hazard.

25|$|The reader learns a {{great deal}} about what the family was like from how the robots {{continue}} on in their functions. Breakfast is automatically made, clothes are laid out, voice reminders of daily activities are called out, but no one is there. Robotic mice vacuum the home and tidy up. As the day progresses, the rain quits, and the house prepares lunch and opens like a flower to the warm weather. A starving dog, apparently the family pet, whines at the door, is admitted and dies. Outside, a vivid image is given: the family's silhouettes were permanently burned onto {{the side of the house}} (as occurred at Hiroshima) when they were vaporized by the nuclear explosion. That night, a storm crashes a tree into the home, starting a fire that the house cannot combat, as the municipal water supply has dried up and failed.

25|$|At about 10 pm on December 22, 1933, Mrs. Huffman {{reported}} smelling {{an unusual}} odor, and {{was overcome by}} a feeling of nausea. The odor and the nausea returned again at {{about a half hour}} later, at which time Huffman contacted the police. A third attack occurred around 1 am, this time affecting <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>house.</b> In total, eight members of the Huffman family were affected by the gas, along with Ashby Henderson, a guest staying at the house. Their symptoms included headaches, nausea, facial swelling, and constriction of the mouth and throat. Alice Huffman, the daughter of Cal Huffman, suffered a more severe reaction to the gas than the other residents. Her throat became so constricted that she stopped breathing and had to be resuscitated. She also suffered convulsive fits for several weeks after the attack, though local physician S.F. Driver recorded {{at the time that he}} believed this was most likely due to anxiety brought on by the attack, rather than the effects of the gas itself.|$|E
25|$|The rooms {{within the}} {{elongation}} are accessed through a 48-foot long, 6-foot wide gallery. The gallery is enclosed in its full length {{through the use}} of an original row of wooden balustrade, supporting operable wooden transoms, movable wooden louvers and wooden shutters, simultaneously providing shade and air, two important local design considerations, as Ponce is known for its hot weather and its implacable sun. Another significant design in Casa Vives related to Ponce's climate is the treatment given to the air circulation within the living quarters. The house has high ceilings, ranging from 14 to 15 feet, to give hot air more space to rise. Adorned ventilation holes are strategically located at the four corners of every room's ceiling, allowing for the heat to exit through the roof and letting the cool air circulate throughout <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>house.</b> The fresh air is captured at the roof through a set of brick and masonry ventilation structures, oriented in an east-to-west direction (the usual direction of the wind currents), and channelized to the house interior. Every single room in the house connects to the adjacent room through wooden double doors (some with louvers and shutters, other of solid construction), allowing air to circulate from one space to another. Furthermore, many of the interior doors are crowned with wooden transoms, facilitating the air conduit even with the doors closed. In addition, every single room has, at least, one wooden double door that open toward the exterior.|$|E

500|$|In the House of Lords, {{technically}} {{called the}} Court of the King (or Queen) in Parliament, the Lord High Steward was the President or Chairman of the Court, and <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>House</b> determined both questions {{of fact and}} questions of law {{as well as the}} verdict. By convention, Bishops and Archbishops did not vote on the verdict, though they were expected to attend {{during the course of the}} trial. They sat until the conclusion of the deliberations, and withdrew from the chamber just prior to the final vote. At the end of the trial, peers voted on the question before them by standing and declaring their verdict by saying [...] "guilty, upon my honour" [...] or [...] "not guilty, upon my honour", starting with the most junior baron and proceeding in order of precedence ending with the Lord High Steward. For a guilty verdict, a majority of twelve was necessary. <b>The</b> <b>entire</b> <b>House</b> also determined the punishment to be imposed, which had to accord with the law.
