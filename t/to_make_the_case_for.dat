5|$|Neglected in her {{relationship}} with the once-human Manhattan, whose now-godlike powers and transformation have removed him completely from the everyday concerns of living beings and no longer kept on retainer by the government, Juspeczyk stays with Dreiberg; they begin a romance, don their costumes, and resume vigilante work as they grow closer together. With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach's conspiracy theory, the pair take {{it upon themselves to}} break him out of prison. Manhattan, after looking back on his own personal history, places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands. He teleports her to Mars <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> emotional investment. During the course of the argument, Juspeczyk is forced {{to come to terms with}} the fact that Blake, who once attempted to rape her mother, was in fact her biological father following a second, consensual relationship. This discovery, reflecting the complexity of human emotions and relationships, re-sparks Manhattan's interest in humanity.|$|E

However, Michael was allowed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> his survival, and Sugar agreed to let him continue, before sending Michael and Helene back to the house. Lee was, at this point, the only candidate who had not appeared in the final boardroom.|$|E

25|$|On 12 December, with Pakistan facing {{imminent}} defeat, the United States {{requested that}} the Security Council be reconvened. Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was rushed to New York City <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> a resolution on the cease fire. The council continued deliberations for four days. By the time proposals were finalised, Pakistan's forces in the East had surrendered and the war had ended, making the measures merely academic. Bhutto, frustrated {{by the failure of}} the resolution and the inaction of the United Nations, ripped up his speech and left the council.|$|E
500|$|With the Webster-Ashburton Treaty {{ratified}} in 1843, Tyler {{was ready}} to make the annexation of Texas his [...] "top priority". Representative Thomas W. Gilmer of Virginia was authorized by the administration <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> annexation to the American electorate. In a widely circulated open letter, understood as an announcement of the executive branch's designs for Texas, Gilmer described Texas as a panacea for North-South conflict and an economic boon to all commercial interests. The slavery issue, however divisive, would be left for the states to decide as per the US Constitution. Domestic tranquility and national security, Tyler argued, would result from an annexed Texas; a Texas left outside American jurisdiction would imperil the Union. Tyler adroitly arranged the resignation of his anti-annexation Secretary of State Daniel Webster, and on June 23, 1843 [...] appointed Abel P. Upshur, a Virginia states' rights champion and ardent proponent of Texas annexation. This cabinet shift signaled Tyler's intent to pursue Texas annexation aggressively.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Brannan {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} The Objective Standard, and noted that it provides a [...] "barrage of evidence in moral defense of the oil sands producers", while Peter Foster, a Financial Post columnist, suggested that Levant [...] "not only exposes the lies and hypocrisy of the media-coddled opponents of the vast resource, but raises the uncomfortable question of what alternatives to the oilsands these moralists prefer". On the other hand, David Suzuki, dismissing Levant as an [...] "apologist", argued that [...] "the logic is faulty. Just because a country or society is considered 'ethical' does not mean everything it produces or exports is ethical". In the Winnipeg Free Press, John Collins, a retired union negotiator, criticized some of Levant's sources, noting {{the presence of the}} Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers in the footnotes, while Patrick Brethour, an editor for The Globe and Mail writing in the Literary Review of Canada, contends that the title of Levant’s book [...] "is a considerable misstatement" [...] and that Levant [...] "fails <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> ethical oil".|$|E

500|$|Markham had, {{through his}} various activities, {{come to know}} many {{influential}} people, and during the early 1870s used these connections <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> a Royal Naval Arctic expedition. Prime minister Benjamin Disraeli consented, in the [...] "spirit of maritime enterprise that has ever distinguished the English people". When the expedition was ready to sail, Markham was invited to accompany {{it as far as}} Greenland, on , one of the expedition's three ships. Markham accepted, and left with the convoy on [...] 1875. He was gone for three months, remaining with Alert as far as the island of Disco in Baffin Bay. He wrote of this journey: [...] "I never had a happier cruise... a nobler set of fellows never sailed together." [...] He returned to England on the support vessel , although the homeward voyage was delayed after Valorous struck a reef and required substantial repairs. Markham's extended absence from his India Office duties, together with his increasing involvement in a range of other interests, caused his superiors to request his resignation. Markham retired from his post in 1877, his 22 years of service entitling him to a pension.|$|E
500|$|In Imagined History, Fading Memory: Mastering Narrative in Final Fantasy X, Washburn {{writes that}} Final Fantasy X [...] "makes the {{relationship}} of memory, history, and the struggle for control of knowledge a central element of both its gameplay and its narrative." [...] Washburn gives a synopsis of the game's alternate history and describes Spira's development as [...] "evok a number of culturally vital discourses in Japan that the designers of the game drew on: the modernist aesthetics of evanescence, the loss of faith and belief {{in a society where}} technology and religion clash, the desire for a dream realm of memories as the source of an alternative history, and the nostalgic desire for the sublime experience of the annihilation of the past and the completion of history." [...] Washburn uses Final Fantasy X and the analysis of its narrative <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>for</b> academic study of the medium and counter the critical views held by detractors like Espen Aarseth, summarizing that [...] "The ability to complete the game requires mastering not only the instrumental controls needed to acquire and perfect game skills but also the narrative itself, the cultural knowledge of Spira that facilitates the acquisition of skills and abilities." [...] In Languages Of Navigation Within Computer Games Flynn asserts that Final Fantasy Xs navigation is a representative and symbolic language, writing that [...] "lthough Final Fantasy X establishes itself through the opening cut scene as narrative based, it becomes clear that a poetic and mythic experience of space rather than a cinematic sense of space is in operation." ...|$|E
