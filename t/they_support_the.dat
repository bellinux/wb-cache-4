5|$|In 1984, Sayers founded Crest Computer Supply Company in the Chicago area. Under Sayers' leadership, {{this company}} {{experienced}} consistent growth and was renamed Sayers 40, Inc. Currently, he {{is chairman of}} Sayers 40, Inc., a technology consulting and implementation firm serving Fortune 1000 companies nationally with offices in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Canton, Massachusetts, Clearwater, Florida, and Atlanta. Sayers and his wife Ardythe are also active philanthropists in Chicago. <b>They</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> Cradle Foundation—an adoption organization in Evanston, Illinois, and they founded the Gale Sayers Center in the Austin neighborhood of Chicago. The Gale Sayers Center is an after-school program for children ages 8–12 from Chicago's west side and focuses on leadership development, tutoring, and mentoring. In 2009, Sayers joined the University of Kansas Athletic Department staff as Director of Fundraising for Special Projects.|$|E
5|$|Many {{recently}} developed SGDs include performance measurement and analysis tools to help monitor the content used by an individual. This raises concerns about privacy, and {{some argue that}} the device user {{should be involved in}} the decision to monitor use in this way. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the proposals for devices with automatic content generation, and privacy is increasingly a factor in design of SGDs. As AAC devices are designed to be used in all areas of a user’s life, there are sensitive legal, social, and technical issues centred on a wide family of personal data management problems that can be found in contexts of AAC use. For example, SGDs may have to be designed so that <b>they</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> user's right to delete logs of conversations or content that has been added automatically.|$|E
5|$|The temple is {{enclosed}} in the cave, it has interior walls but no exterior wall. The pillars create {{the space and}} symmetric rhythm as <b>they</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> weight of hill above. The main mandapa recesses into a pillared vestibule (ardha-mandapa) on the south side, while a pillared portico (mukha-mandapa) connects it to the main entrance. Embedded within the Great Cave are dedicated shrines, the largest {{of which is the}} square plan Linga shrine (see 16 in plan). It is a square garbha-griya (womb house) with four entrances, located in the right section of the main hall. Steps lead from the four doorways into the sanctum, which has a linga in the mulavigraha style. Each doorway is guarded by a dvarapala on each side, for a total of eight dvarapalas, their heights spanning floor to the ceiling. These were badly damaged when the Portuguese ceded control of this region to the British. The linga shrine is surrounded by a mandapa and circumambulation path (pradakshina-patha) as in other Hindu temples. The pillars are similarly aligned east-west to this shrine, and have an east entrance. Overlaid, as if fused, on the architecture of this temple is another open temple aligned to the north-south direction with three faced Sadashiva as its focal center. One features the abstract, unmanifest, aniconic symbol of Shiva, the other anthropomorphic, manifest, iconic symbol of Shiva. The mandapa pillars of the two align up.|$|E

25|$|The party emerged {{around the}} {{supporters}} of Ruairí Ó Brádaigh and Dáithí Ó Conaill.

The party also believes that the cancelling of international debt should take place immediately and any financial assistance should be in the form of grants and not loans, limiting debt service payments to 10% of export earnings per year.|$|E
25|$|Unsustainable {{land use}} {{practices}} {{are threatening to}} degrade watersheds and are adding to the growing complexities of managing groundwater. Additionally, the volcanic aquifers consist mainly of interstratifications of gaps and fissures which allow for high permeability and infiltration. In many cases, these make the aquifers highly vulnerable to human contamination from the cities in which <b>they</b> <b>support.</b> <b>The</b> heterogeneity of these aquifers make them complicated to study and manage. Consequently, growing signs of conflict and competition for water use between sector needs are being observed in some regions.|$|E

25|$|Most Diaspora Jews {{identify}} with Zionism {{and have done}} so since the 1930s, {{in the sense that}} <b>they</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> State of Israel, even if they do not choose to emigrate; the Zionist movement also has undertaken a variety of roles to encourage support for Israel. These have included encouraging immigration and assisting immigrants in absorption and integration, fund-raising on behalf of needs and development, encouraging private capital investment, and mobilizing public opinion support for Israel internationally. Worldwide Jewish political and financial support has been of vital importance for Israel.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the last}} hundred years, {{more than half of}} the Earth's {{wetlands}} have been destroyed and have disappeared. These wetlands are important not only because they are the habitats of numerous inhabitants such as mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and invertebrates, but <b>they</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> growing of rice and other food crops as well as provide water filtration and protection from storms and flooding. Freshwater lakes such as the Aral Sea in central Asia have also suffered. Once the fourth largest freshwater lake, it has lost more than 58,000 square km of area and vastly increased in salt concentration over the span of three decades.|$|E
25|$|Well {{into the}} 20th century, {{the party had}} {{conservative}} pro-business and Southern conservative-populist anti-business wings. The New Deal Coalition of 1932–1964 attracted strong support from voters of recent European extraction—many of whom were Catholics based in the cities. After Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal of the 1930s, the pro-business wing withered outside the South. After the racial turmoil of the 1960s, most Southern whites and many Northern Catholics moved into the Republican Party at the presidential level. The once-powerful labor union element became smaller and less supportive after the 1970s. White Evangelicals and Southerners became heavily Republican {{at the state and}} local level in the 1990s. Racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S., such as Jewish Americans, Hispanic Americans, Arabic Americans and African Americans, tend to support the Democratic Party much more than <b>they</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> rival Republican Party, giving the Democratic Party its current membership lead over the Republicans.|$|E

25|$|The Takembeng women {{provide a}} unique {{political}} {{organization in the}} restrictive political environment of Cameroon. In order to avoid being stopped by security forces as they walk from rural areas to urban centers they wear better clothing on the trip. However, when they march, the state responds with less violent measures than they do with other protesters (although at times, Takembeng women are also placed under house arrest, beaten, and killed by the government). As {{a result of this}} greater tolerance, Takembeng women provide some key support to the opposition party, the Social Democratic Front (SDF). In 1998, Takembeng women provided a protective caravan for John Fru Ndi, SDF Chairman, to leave the country and make a political trip to France and the United States. Although they are related closely with the SDF, the members of the Takembeng are clear in interviews that they are not a branch or tool of the party; instead, <b>they</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> ideals of the party {{and as long as the}} SDF holds to those values, their protests will overlap. During the disorder of the early 1990s, Takembeng women were recorded disrupting troops from elsewhere in Cameroon by stripping in front of them.|$|E
500|$|Critics such as Lester Crocker, Henry Stavan, and Vivienne Mylne find {{too many}} {{similarities}} between Candides {{point of view}} and that of Voltaire to accept the [...] "inside" [...] view; <b>they</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> [...] "outside" [...] interpretation. They believe that Candide's final decision is the same as Voltaire's, and see a strong connection between the development of the protagonist and his author. Some scholars who support the [...] "outside" [...] view also believe that the isolationist philosophy of the Old Turk closely mirrors that of Voltaire. Others see a strong parallel between Candide's gardening at the conclusion and the gardening of the author. Martine Darmon Meyer argues that the [...] "inside" [...] view fails to see the satirical work in context, and that denying that Candide is primarily a mockery of optimism (a matter of historical context) is a [...] "very basic betrayal of the text".|$|E
500|$|A {{great number}} of small figures are {{integrated}} with the painted architecture, their purpose apparently purely decorative. These include two faux marble putti below the cornice on each rib, each one a male and female pair; stone rams-heads are placed {{at the apex of}} each spandrel; copper-skinned nude figures in varying poses, hiding in the shadows, propped between the spandrels and the ribs like animated bookends; and more putti, both clothed and unclothed strike a variety of poses as <b>they</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> nameplates of the Prophets and Sibyls. Above the cornice and to either side of the smaller scenes are an array of round shields, or medaillons. They are framed by a total of twenty more figures, the so-called Ignudi, which {{are not part of the}} architecture but sit on inlaid plinths, their feet planted convincingly on the fictive cornice. Pictorially, the Ignudi appear to occupy a space between the narrative spaces and the space of the chapel itself. (see below) ...|$|E
