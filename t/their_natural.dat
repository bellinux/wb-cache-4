40|$|AbstractResearch {{has raised}} {{concerns}} {{that there is}} a growing disparity between young children and <b>their</b> local, <b>natural</b> environments [1; 2]. Concerns over environmental issues and children's awareness of <b>their</b> local, <b>natural</b> environment have further prompted education departments to include environmental and sustainability concepts in curriculum documents. In the most recent Australian curriculum, currently in draft form, a major component of the curriculum has included sustainability [3]. To gain an understanding of children's awareness of their environment, an action research study was conducted between Australia and Singapore with two groups of children aged five to seven years. The study explored children's perceptions of <b>their</b> local <b>natural</b> environments and whether, if they were offered an authentic, real-life activity such as postcard exchanges with children in another location, their awareness of, and interest in, both their own and others’ local natural environments would increase. The study found that while children's awareness of sustainability and <b>their</b> local, <b>natural</b> environment increased through the activity, children in Australia were more aware of, and interacted with, <b>their</b> local <b>natural</b> environment than children in Singapore...|$|R

5|$|Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) {{was brought}} to Southern Florida as an {{ornamental}} shrub and was dispersed by the droppings of birds and other animals that ate its bright red berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land growing in forests too dense for wading birds to nest in, similar to melaleucas.

The study sought to map children's interests in, and concern for, <b>their</b> local, <b>natural</b> environments. Because the attitudes and understandings that children have of their world are formed through interaction with their world, their society, their education and their environment, such attitudes and understandings will in turn, determine how they will interact with their environment as adults. Thus, two diverse groups of children in two diverse settings, one group in rural Australia and one group in urbanized Singapore, were selected to understand what interests and concerns each group of children had for <b>their</b> own local, <b>natural</b> environment {{as well as the}} environments of others. Data was collected through interviews with the children, observations and from the drawings and storytelling in postcards which children used {{to communicate with each other}} for three months.

5|$|The largest {{range of}} any species {{is that of}} the rock dove. This species had a large natural {{distribution}} from Britain and Ireland to northern Africa, across Europe, Arabia, Central Asia, India, the Himalayas and up into China and Mongolia.

The species is currently resident across most of North America, and has established itself in cities and urban areas in South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. The species is not the only pigeon to have increased its range due to the actions of man; several other species have become established outside of <b>their</b> <b>natural</b> range after escaping captivity, and other species have increased <b>their</b> <b>natural</b> ranges due to habitat changes caused by human activity.|$|E
