40|$|Abstract. The multifactor {{version of}} copula models {{has the ability}} to {{generate}} complex correlation structure among defaults that is useful in fitting the base correlation skew. However, multifactor models have often been dismissed for their intractability. Even the semianalytical approach using Laplace trans-forms is computationally challenging, because although the model is tractable <b>upon</b> <b>conditioning</b> on the factors, unconditioning usually requires high efforts of integrating out the factors. To circum-vent this problem, this paper develops a fast, closed-form approximation to the Laplace transform in multifactor models. The method, which approximates the conditional transform in a way that lends itself to closed-form unconditioning in arbitrarily high dimensions, is applicable to a range of models with Gaussian factors, including models that extend the standard Gaussian copula to allow stochastic recovery rates and factor loadings. We analyze the accuracy and convergence properties of the approximation. Numerical examples illustrate the speed and accuracy of the method. Key words.

The {{results show that the}} SmFe_{ 1 -x}Ru_{x}AsO_{ 0. 85 }F_{ 0. 15 } system keeps a multigap character at least up to x= 0. 50, and that the gap amplitudes Delta_ 1 and Delta_ 2 scale almost linearly with the local critical temperature TcA. The gap ratios 2 Delta_i/(kB Tc) remain approximately constant only as long as Tc > 30 K, but increase dramatically when Tc decreases further. This trend seems to be common to many Fe-based superconductors, irrespective of their family. Based on first-principle calculations of the bandstructure and of the density of states projected on the different bands, we show that this trend, as well as the Tc dependence of the gaps and the reduction of <b>Tc</b> <b>upon</b> Ru doping, can be explained within an effective three-band Eliashberg model as being due to a suppression of the superfluid density at finite temperature that, in turns, modifies the temperature dependence of the characteristic spin-fluctuation energy.

We have determined the rates {{and extent of}} TC incorporation into bovine brain microtubules and developed a theory that models copolymerization. Our analysis suggests that while the apparent association rate constants for tubulin and TC are similar, the apparent dissociation rate constants for TC are a factor of five or more larger than those of tubulin. Copolymer composition showed only slight changes during assembly despite changes in the solution phase and showed little dependence at high <b>TC</b> <b>upon</b> the initial tubulin concentration. The theory was based on coupled Oosawa-Kasai equations that allow for the co-assembly of two components, tubulin and TC. An expression was derived that relates copolymer composition to reaction mixture composition and to the affinity of microtubule ends for tubulin and TC. This expression predicts copolymer composition at TC concentrations less than 10 microM and correlates composition with assembly inhibition. We perceive copolymerization as a facilitated incorporation of TC requiring the presence of tubulin. TC incorporation was dependent on the ratio of total tubulin to the dissociation constant for TC bound to microtubule ends. The copolymerization reaction is thus characterized by an interplay of two effects (a) where tubulin facilitates the incorporation of TC into the microtubule, and (b) where TC inhibits the assembly of tubulin into microtubules...|$|R

To estimate the direct effect of BW on BP, it is conventional to condition on current weight (CW). However, such conditioning can induce collider stratification bias in the estimate of the direct effect. Objective: To bound the potential bias due to U, an unmeasured common cause of CW and BP, on the estimate of the (controlled) direct effect of BW on BP. Methods: Data from a school based study in Switzerland were used (N = 4, 005; 2, 010 B/ 1, 995 G; mean age: 12. 3 yr [range: 10. 1 - 14. 9]). Measured common causes of BW-BP (SES, smoking, body weight, and hypertension status of the mother) and CW-BP (breastfeeding and child's physical activity and diet) were identified with DAGs. Linear regression models were fitted to estimate the association between BW and BP. Sensitivity {{analyses were conducted to}} assess the potential effect of U on the association between BW and BP. U was assumed 1) to be a binary variable that affected BP by the same magnitude in low BWand in normal BW children and 2) to have a different prevalence in low BW children and in normal BW children for a given CW. Results: A small negative association was observed between BW and BP [beta: - 0. 3 mmHg/kg (95 % CI: - 0. 9 to 0. 3) ]. The association was strengthened <b>upon</b> <b>conditioning</b> for CW [beta: - 1. 5 mmHg/kg (95 % CI: - 2. 1 to - 0. 9) ]. <b>Upon</b> further <b>conditioning</b> on common causes of BW-BP and CW-BP, the association did not change substantially [beta: - 1. 4 mmHg/kg (95 % CI: - 2. 0 to - 0. 8) ].

The results indicate that an increase in PH 2 tends to increase the AV and KV while decreasing the HV of the BFO. The BFO yield (YBFO) increases with PH 2 and tr. The above properties decrease with increasing <b>TC.</b> <b>Upon</b> HTC at 0. 69 MPa (100 psig) H 2 pressure, 60 min time, and 683 K temperature, the YBFO was found to be 86 wt%. The resulting BFO possesses simulated distillation characteristics superior to those of boat oil and heavy oil while being similar to those of diesel oil. The BFO contains 15. 48 % light naphtha, 35. 73 % heavy naphtha, 21. 79 % light gas oil, and 27 % heavy gas oil and vacuum residue. These constituents can be further refined to produce gasoline, diesel, lubricants, and other fuel products...|$|R
40|$|The lattice {{vibration}} and crystal structure of alkaline earth metal-substituted RuSr 1. 9 A 0. 1 GdCu 2 O 8 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba) {{have been investigated}} with micro-Raman spectroscopy. The present RuSr 1. 9 A 0. 1 GdCu 2 O 8 materials show not only several weak Raman peaks corresponding to the vibrations of OCu and ORu but also strong characteristic phonon lines related to OSr vibration mode. A comparison between the frequency of OSr vibration and the bond distances of (Ru‒OSr) and (Cu‒OSr) in the present ruthenocuprates reveals that the vibration energy of OSr is mainly dependent on the bond distance of (Ru‒OSr). The peak splitting of the OSr phonon lines was observed for the unsubstituted RuSr 2 GdCu 2 O 8, suggesting the existence of two different (Ru‒OSr) bond distances. Such a peak splitting caused {{by the appearance of}} low-energy shoulder reflects the presence of internal charge transfer pathway from the RuO 2 plane to the superconductive CuO 2 one. After the substitution of Sr with Ca or Ba, the low-energy shoulder peak of OSr vibration becomes suppressed, underscoring the depression of internal charge transfer between the RuO 2 and CuO 2 planes. The weakened role of RuO 2 layer as charge reservoir in the RuSr 1. 9 A 0. 1 GdCu 2 O 8 (A = Ca, Ba) would be responsible for the depression of <b>Tc</b> <b>upon</b> the Ca/Ba substitution...|$|R
40|$|One {{branch of}} the aid {{effectiveness}} literature (AEL) analyzes conditional models where aid effectiveness depends <b>upon</b> a <b>conditioning</b> variable z. The leading candidates for z are a good policy index and aid itself, so that the model has an aid squared term. In this paper, meta-analysis techniques are used (i) {{to determine whether the}} AEL has established the said interaction terms, and (ii) to identify some of the determinants of the differences in results between studies. We find no support for conditionality with respect to policy, nor with respect to aid itself. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
