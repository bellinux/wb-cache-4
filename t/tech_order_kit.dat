5000|$|Spectrum 3 {{fatigue testing}} started in 1979. This round of testing quickly {{determined}} that more drastic reinforcement would be needed. The second change in production, starting with aircraft #442, was {{to increase the}} thickness of the lower skin on the outer wing panels. A <b>tech</b> <b>order</b> was issued to retrofit the [...] "thick skin" [...] to the whole fleet, but the <b>tech</b> <b>order</b> was rescinded after roughly 242 planes, leaving about 200 planes with the original [...] "thin skin". Starting with aircraft #530, cold working at WS0 was performed, and this retrofit was performed on earlier aircraft. A fourth, even more drastic change was initiated with aircraft #582, again to address the problems discovered with spectrum 3 testing. This change increased the thickness on the lower skin on the center wing panel but it required modifications to the lower spar caps to accommodate the thicker skin. The Air Force determined that it was not economically feasible to retrofit earlier planes with this modification.|$|R
