40|$|This work is {{dedicated}} to the investigations and evaluations of the ecological situation in <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Moldova’s</b> rural areas. <b>The</b> anthropogenic impact’s level over agro landscape was calculated and evaluated {{on the basis of the}} parameters of the ecological risk’s factors – naturals and anthropogenic; at the same time, the ecological stability’s coefficient of various areas was determined according to the quotas of different land categories and their way of using. The investigation works show that the ecological risk over the territory mainly depends on major indicators – relief, ravine intensity, the hydrographical network’s density, the tillage and forestation degree, lands stabilizing the environment, the land’s degree of development, the ecological dangerous objects placement, the anthropogenic impact’s level. The ecological situation will also be directly influenced by animal and human wastage t/km 2, which are formed and stocked on several areas. The detailed analysis for <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Moldova’s</b> localities indicates a big variability of the indexes which will determine the ecological situation and the anthropogenic impact’s level over some areas. The improvement of the territory’s stability can be achieved by decreasing the arable land and the tree plantations - viticulture quota, by increasing the areas with hay, grass land, sylvan areas, lakes and plashes, and by decreasing the anthropogenic impact and by applying anti erosion measures on slopes...|$|R

25|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, most of Bessarabia returned to independence, as <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Moldova.</b> As of that moment, Pântea's name continues to be a subject of contention in the debates over Moldovan nationhood: a hero to the pro-unionists, he is largely ignored by the Moldovenists. This was noted in 2010 by unionist politician Mircea Druc, who assessed that, other than a commemorative plaque in Chișinău, there was little left to attest Pântea's significance to the Moldovan Republic. Nicolae Costin, who was Mayor of Chișinău between 1990 and 1994, reportedly sought to revive Pântea's urban projects (continued, after another long hiatus, by Dorin Chirtoacă).|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} Moldova {{can be traced}} to the 1350s, when the Principality of Moldavia, the medieval {{precursor}} of modern Moldova and Romania, was founded. The principality was a vassal of the Ottoman Empire from 1538 until the 19th century. In 1812, following one of several Russian-Turkish wars, the eastern half of the principality, Bessarabia, was annexed by the Russian Empire. In 1918, Bessarabia briefly became independent as the Moldavian Democratic Republic and, following the decision of the Parliament (Sfatul Țării), united with Romania. In 1940 it was annexed by the Soviet Union, joined to the Moldavian ASSR, and became the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic until the dissolution of the USSR. In 1991 the country declared independence as <b>the</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Moldova.</b>|$|E
