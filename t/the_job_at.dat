40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{characterize}} the equilibrium in a labor market where employed workers search on <b>the</b> <b>job</b> and firms direct the search by announcing wages and employment probabilities for the applicants. All workers/jobs are homogeneous and free entry of firms determines <b>the</b> number of <b>jobs.</b> <b>The</b> equilibrium features a wage ladder, with {{a finite number}} of rungs. Workers on each particular rung of the ladder choose (optimally) to apply to only <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>at</b> one level above their current wage, despite that they observe all higher wage offers. Workers choose not to leap several rungs at a time on the wage ladder because <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>at</b> one level above their current wage provide a significantly higher employment probability, and hence a higher expected surplus, than <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>at</b> two or more levels above. The wage ladder has the following properties: (i) The gap between two adjacent rungs on the ladder becomes smaller and smaller as wage increases; (ii) A worker s quit rate decreases with wage; (iii) A worker s wage, on average, increases with the employment duration; (iv) The average length of time an unemployed worker will take to return to his previous wage increases with that wage; (v) The density of offer wages decreases with wage; (vi) The density of employed wages can be decreasing, increasing, or hump-shaped. The directed search framework replicates empirical regularities on the wage path of workers and the distribution of offer and employed wages that undirected search cannot.
