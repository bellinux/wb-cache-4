5|$|After Breezewood, I-76 {{continues}} {{along the}} turnpike, heading northeast across Rays Hill into Fulton County. The turnpike continues east across Sideling Hill, before reaching an interchange with US522 in Fort Littleton. After this interchange the highway parallels US522 before curving east into Huntingdon County. The turnpike goes under Tuscarora Mountain through the Tuscarora Mountain Tunnel, entering Franklin County. It then curves northeast into a valley <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> for PA75 in Willow Hill.|$|E
5|$|After the Allegheny River {{crossing}} the turnpike returns to four lanes, {{passing through the}} Oakmont Country Club. The highway heads southeast to Monroeville, an eastern suburb of Pittsburgh; an interchange with I-376/US22 (Penn–Lincoln Parkway) provides access to Pittsburgh. East of Monroeville, the turnpike continues through eastern Allegheny County before crossing into Westmoreland County. Here, it heads south <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> for US30 in Irwin.|$|E
5|$|After the Irwin {{interchange}}, the Pennsylvania Turnpike widens to six {{lanes and}} {{heads into the}} rural area west of Greensburg. Curving southeast, it reaches New Stanton; an interchange provides access to I-70, US119 and the southern terminus of PA66 (the Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass). The road narrows back to four lanes at this interchange, and I-70 forms a concurrency with I-76 on the turnpike. After New Stanton, the road winds southeast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> for PA31/PA711 in Donegal. Continuing east past Donegal, the turnpike crosses Laurel Hill into Somerset County.|$|E

5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Four large mosaic {{panels are}} {{installed}} on either {{ends of the}} station hall and the two escalator tunnels. On the side that leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> to the city, a panel was installed depicting {{the patron saint of}} Kiev, Michael the Archangel. Meanwhile, {{at the very end of}} the station, Saint George is depicted, symbolizing Moscow, the Soviet Union's capital at the time. One of the mosaic panels at the end of the station near the escalators includes an inscription featuring a Ukrainian nationalist slogan, stating СЛАВА УКРАЇНІ, which is translated as Glory to Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Prix was contested by eleven teams, each of two drivers. The teams, {{also known}} as constructors, were McLaren, Ferrari, Jordan, Jaguar, Williams, Benetton, Prost, Sauber, Arrows, Minardi and BAR. Tyre {{supplier}} Bridgestone brought three different tyre types to the race: the Medium dry compound and two wet-weather compounds, the intermediate and full wet. The Suzuka Circuit underwent a minor circuit change ahead of the Grand Prix. The pit lane entry was moved {{from the end of}} the 130R left-hand corner <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> of the Casio chicane in an effort to improve safety.|$|E

40|$|A {{modified}} dynamic cellular automata {{model is}} proposed <b>to</b> simulate <b>the</b> evacuation of occupants from {{a room with}} obstacles. The model takes into account some factors that {{play an important role}} in an evacuation process, such as human emotions and crowd density around <b>the</b> <b>exits.</b> It also incorporates people’s ability to select a less congested exit route, a factor that is rarely investigated. The simulation and experimental results show that modifications <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exits</b> provide reasonable improvement to evacuation time, after taking into account the fact that people will tend to select exit routes based on <b>the</b> distance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exits</b> and <b>the</b> crowd density around <b>the</b> <b>exits.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> model is applied to simulations of classroom and restaurant evacuation. Results obtained with the proposed model are compared with those of several existing models. The outcome of the comparison demonstrates that it performs better than existing models...|$|R
5|$|The episode {{served as}} a {{follow-up}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> of the main character Cleveland Brown, who left Family Guy in order to star in his own Fox spin-off, entitled The Cleveland Show. Main cast member and former series writer Mike Henry returned to the series to provide the voice of Cleveland.

5|$|Outside the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, {{the parkway}} comes to MD197 (Laurel–Bowie Road) south of Laurel. Near this exit of the parkway is the Montpelier Mansion, a Georgian mansion built by Major Thomas Snowden in 1783. Past MD197, the road {{passes through the}} western edge of the Patuxent National Wildlife Research Refuge, a {{wildlife}} center established in 1936 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, crossing the Patuxent River into Anne Arundel County. Here the parkway continues northeast through dense woodland and comes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> for MD198 (Fort Meade Road) to the east of Laurel, which itself is a suburb that originated in the 1830s as a mill town that contains many historical sites such as the Laurel Railroad Station (still used today by MARC Train), an 1844 Queen Anne house, and an 1840s millworkers house that is home to the Laurel Museum.|$|E

5|$|The Cross-Westchester Expressway, {{which is}} {{maintained}} by the New York State Thruway Authority, is six lanes wide and carries I-287 east to a westbound exit for NY119 that is intertwined with the ramps between the New York State Thruway and NY119/Saw Mill River Parkway. After passing over the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Saw Mill River, the road enters the Village of Elmsford and runs through developed areas as it has a partial diamond interchange with NY9A {{that does not have}} an eastbound exit. The Cross-Westchester Expressway turns southeast from this point and intersects the Sprain Brook Parkway. I-287 widens to eight lanes at this junction and continues <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> for NY100A. After the NY100A interchange, the freeway leaves Elmsford and turns to the east near residential areas, narrowing to six lanes before coming to an exit for NY100 and NY119 that also has access to the Bronx River Parkway.|$|E
5|$|The Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system method of tolling between the Mid-County and Wyoming Valley toll plazas {{along with the}} {{mainline}} Pennsylvania Turnpike. With the ticket system, a motorist receives a ticket upon entering the turnpike at an interchange and pays the fare and surrenders the ticket upon exiting. If a motorist loses the ticket, the turnpike charges the highest fare <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> where the motorist leaves. Mainline toll plazas are also located at Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit, charging a flat rate. There are no tolls on exit ramps between Wyoming Valley and Clarks Summit. E-ZPass is accepted at all toll plazas. As of 2017, it costs a passenger vehicle $12.10 to travel {{the length of the}} Northeast Extension between Mid-County and Wyoming Valley using cash and $8.54 using E-ZPass. The Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas cost $1.45 using cash and $0.81 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Past NY303, I-87/I-287 {{turns to}} the east-southeast and passes near wooded areas as well as {{suburban}} neighborhoods of Central Nyack. It comes to another interchange with NY59 that also provides access to US9W. Within this interchange, the roadway has an eastbound toll gantry for the Tappan Zee Bridge that allows tolls to be collected at highway speeds using E-ZPass or Tolls by Mail. At this point, the New York State Thruway widens to eight lanes and {{turns to the}} south-southeast into the Village of Nyack in the Town of Orangetown, crossing over US9W prior to passing near residential areas in the Village of South Nyack as it runs {{to the east of}} US9W, descending The Palisades. The last interchange in Rockland County is with US9W and has no southbound exit. From here, the New York State Thruway crosses the Hudson River on the Tappan Zee Bridge east into the Village of Tarrytown in the Town of Greenburgh in Westchester County. After passing over the river, the road crosses over Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line. After this, the freeway comes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> for US9 that also serves the western terminus of NY119. I-87/I-287 continue east past woodland and business parks, leaving Tarrytown before coming to an interchange where the two routes split, with I-87 continuing south on the New York State Thruway and I-287 heading east on the Cross-Westchester Expressway. This interchange also has access to and from the northbound Saw Mill River Parkway and NY119.|$|E

5|$|The French were fast {{to bring}} up and deploy the fresh troops in front of San Giuliano, and the Austrians were slow to mount their attack. Boudet and the 9ème Légère (9th Light Infantry Regiment) were quickly moved on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> from the main vine belt, where they {{surprised}} the head of Saint-Julien’s column. As the Austrian infantry deployed {{on the south side}} of the road, the 9ème Légère conducted a steady withdrawal for 30 minutes back to Desaix’s position. There he had placed GdB Louis Charles de Guénand’s brigade on the north side while most of the remaining French army (Monnier and Lannes) were forming up north from there. The Austrians deployed three artillery batteries on the north side of the road supported by a dragoon regiment. GdB Auguste de Marmont massed the remaining French cannon against the Austrians as they advanced. Boudet's division advanced in line of brigades against the head of the Austrian column, defeating Saint-Julien's leading Austrian brigade. Zach brought forward GM Latterman's grenadier brigade in line and renewed the attack. Faced with a crisis, Napoleon sent Desaix forward again and ordered a cavalry charge requested by Desaix. The 9ème Légère halted to face the main Austrian advance and Marmont's guns blasted the Austrians with grapeshot at close range. Further back, an Austrian ammunition limber exploded. In the temporary heightening of confusion, Lattermann's formation was charged on its left flank by Kellermann's heavy cavalry (ca. 400 men) and disintegrated. At the decisive moment of the battle, Desaix was shot from his horse. Zach and at least 2,000 of his men were taken prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, 2002–03, saw the Avalanche {{claim the}} NHL {{record for most}} consecutive division titles, nine, breaking the Montreal Canadiens streak of eight, won between 1974–82. The division title came after a bad start by the team, that led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> of head coach Bob Hartley, in December. General Manager Pierre Lacroix promoted assistant coach Tony Granato, who had only three months of coaching experience as an assistant, to the head coach position. The team's playoff spot seemed in doubt at one point, but the Avalanche managed to finish with 105 points, ahead of the Vancouver Canucks by one. The race to the title was exciting, namely the second-to-last game of the season, as the Avalanche needed {{to win the game}} to stay in the race, and Milan Hejduk scored with 10 seconds left in overtime to beat Anaheim. The title was guaranteed in {{the final day of the}} regular season, when the Avalanche beat the St. Louis Blues 5–2 and the Vancouver Canucks lost against the Los Angeles Kings 2–0. In the Western Conference Quarter-finals, the Avalanche blew a 3–1 series lead over the Minnesota Wild, and lost in overtime in Game 7. Peter Forsberg won the Art Ross Trophy for the leading scorer of the regular season, which he finished with 106 points (29 goals, 77 assists). Forsberg also won the Hart Memorial Trophy for the regular season's most valuable player and shared the NHL Plus/Minus Award with teammate Milan Hejduk. Hejduk scored 50 goals to win the Maurice 'Rocket' Richard Trophy, awarded annually to the leading goal scorer in the NHL. Forsberg was elected to the league's first All-Star team. Hejduk was elected to the second All-Star team.|$|E
5|$|The route {{remained}} intact until {{the construction of}} the Southern Tier Expressway (STE) through Red House in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Unwanted tourism in Jimerson Town, a newly built settlement northeast of Red House, prompted Seneca leaders to seek ways to reduce through traffic in the settlement; to do so, the state built a trumpet interchange off the expressway where NY382 used to be, which, coupled with the flooding of the roadway of old Route 17 to the west, effectively cut Jimerson Town off from the highway system. The construction of the highway also allowed the state to claim eminent domain over most of the hamlet of Red House, leading to the hamlet's destruction; the few remaining private residences in the town as of 2015 are located southwest of what was Route 382. When the interchange at exit19 of the STE was constructed , NY382 was disconnected from Allegany State Park Route2, which was realigned to meet the new exit (as was Bay State Road, much of which was moved to a route south of and parallel to the expressway). The NY382 designation was removed around this time as a result. The roadway still runs from the former NY17 (now NY951T, which terminates near the former NY382's end at a dilapidated bridge) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Exit</b> 19 on/off ramp, but due to safety concerns, the road was blocked off at its eastern terminus.|$|E
