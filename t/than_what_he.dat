5|$|In 2008, {{the annual}} salary for {{entry-level}} ministers was $1,924,300. In {{view of the}} worsening economic crisis in 2008–2009, as of January 2009 the Prime Minister's salary was cut to $3.04 million, while the pay of ministerial-grade officers was reduced by 18% to $1.57 million. In November 2009 the Public Service Division announced that pay increments would be deferred {{for a second time}} in 2010 because of the uncertain economic recovery. A minister's 2009 salary of $1,494,700 per year was therefore 22% lower <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> or she received in 2008.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} piece of advice Yamamoto gave Kurosawa was that a good director needed to master screenwriting. Kurosawa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were much higher <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was paid as an assistant director. Kurosawa would later write or co-write all of his own films. He also frequently wrote screenplays for other directors such as for the antiwar film director Satsuo Yamamoto's film, A Triumph of Wings (Tsubasa no gaika, 1942). This outside scriptwriting would serve Kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s, long after he became world-famous.|$|E

5|$|The {{theology}} of Huldrych Zwingli {{was based on}} the Bible, taking scripture as the inspired word of God and placing its authority higher <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw as human sources such as the ecumenical councils and the church fathers. He also recognised the human element within the inspiration noting the differences in the canonical gospels. Zwinglianism is the Reformed confession based on the Second Helvetic Confession promulgated by Zwingli's successor Heinrich Bullinger in the 1560s.|$|E
5|$|Ament and Gossard were {{devastated by}} the death of Wood and the {{resulting}} demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had been doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} a baby taking his first steps on a beach {{supported}} by his father. The narrator (Murali Mohan) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Siddharth 'Siddhu' Addala (Siddharth) begins verbally abusing all the fathers in the world. When queried about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind (Prakash Raj), gives him more <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairstyle, and many others are overruled by his father's. However, he vows that his career and the woman he marries will be his own choice.|$|E

25|$|Some {{thought that}} Corzine {{would benefit from}} the {{popularity}} of President Barack Obama, who carried the state in 2008 with 57% of the vote and had higher approval ratings than Corzine had. However, Obama's approval ratings in the state varied, ranging from as high as 68% in a June Quinnipiac poll to as low as 53% in a PPP poll, which is lower <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> obtained on election day in 2008. Another poll in July gave him 55% approval in the state, also less <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> obtained on election day. In the same poll 47% believed Obama would help Corzine's numbers in the election by campaigning with him.|$|E

However, Keith Jeffery argues that he failed to realise that the granting of self-government to Ireland and Egypt was also necessary, such concession keeping Egypt (like Iraq to a certain extent) pro-British for another generation.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the loss}} of the ability to read Greek, Thucydides and Herodotus were largely {{forgotten}} during the Middle Ages in Western Europe, although their influence continued in the Byzantine world. In Europe, Herodotus become known and highly respected only in the late-sixteenth and early-seventeenth century as an ethnographer, in part due to the discovery of America, where customs and animals were encountered even more surprising <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had related. During the Reformation, moreover, information about Middle Eastern countries in the Histories provided a basis for establishing Biblical chronology as advocated by Isaac Newton.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{prospect}} of bowing out on a high, Redhage revealed in July 2016 that he never seriously contemplated retirement following the 2015–16 season and always intended to push on into 2016/17. And so it was on 16 August 2016, Redhage re-signed with the Wildcats for the 2016–17 NBL season. In his 12th season as a Wildcat, Redhage took an even further reduced role <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had in 2015/16. With the NBL's move to allow team's to have three imports and carry an 11-man roster in 2016/17, Redhage's playing time quickly dropped to under 10 minutes per game.|$|E

Valued at €180million, these combined fees eclipsed those commanded by Nicolas Anelka. His three-year contract would see him receive a net annual salary of €14million including bonuses (which would be €2million more <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was earning per year just before he left Milan), and make him the second best paid footballer in the world behind Samuel Eto'o.|$|E
25|$|Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Harold Macmillan, advised his Prime Minister, Anthony Eden, {{that the}} United States was fully {{prepared}} {{to carry out}} this threat.

However, there were suspicions in the Cabinet that Macmillan had deliberately overstated the financial situation in order to force Eden out.

He decided on a region in the very western part of Windham, in what is current day Prattsville, for its large forests of hemlock, which was necessary for tanning at the time, as well as its proximity to the Schoharie Creek. The Prattsville Commercial Building, built about 1824, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} My Own Private Idaho came from John Rechy's 1963 novel, City of Night, which {{featured}} characters who were street hustlers {{who did not}} admit to being gay. Van Sant's original screenplay {{was written in the}} 1970s, when he was living in Hollywood. After reading Rechy's book, Van Sant realized that it was considerably better <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was writing, so he shelved the script for years. In 1988, while editing Mala Noche, Van Sant met a street kid named Michael Parker who became a source of inspiration for the character of Mike in what would later become My Own Private Idaho. Parker also had a friend named Scott, a street kid like himself. In the script, Van Sant adapted the Scott character to that of a rich kid. The character of Scott was also fashioned after people Van Sant had met in Portland who were street hustlers.|$|E
25|$|This {{movement}} of d'Erlon's Corps admits of being satisfactorily explained.

D'Erlon hastened to comply with Napoleon's wishes, and despatched General d'Elcambre, his chief of the staff, to make known the movement to Marshal Ney.|$|E
25|$|At the {{parliament}} of 1789 Gustav III united the other estates against the nobility {{and to gain}} {{support for the war}} and for his constitutional reform. Coming into conflict with the nobility, he had many of its representatives imprisoned. This act lead to a social boycott of the monarch by the female members of the aristocracy, who followed the example of Jeanna von Lantingshausen as well as the King's sister and sister-in-law, Sophie Albertine of Sweden and Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte. The Queen did not participate in this political demonstration and refused to allow any talk of politics in her presence. She was nevertheless involved in the conflict. When the King informed his son about the event, he discovered the child to be already informed in other ways <b>than</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had intended. He suspected Sophia Magdalena to be responsible, and asked the governor of the prince, Count Nils Gyldenstolpe, to speak to her. Gyldenstolpe, however, sent one of the king's favorites, Baron Erik Boye. The Queen, who despised the favorites of the King, furiously told Boye that she spoke to her son how she wished and that only her contempt for him prevented her from having him thrown out of the window. She was known to dislike the reforms of 1789, and she did let it be known to its representatives. At the celebrations of the Victory at Fredrikshamn in 1790, she refused to be escorted by riksråd Count Joakim Beck-Friis, who was in favor of the reform, and demanded to be escorted by Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, who was in opposition to it.|$|E
