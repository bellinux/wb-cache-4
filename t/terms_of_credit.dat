We suppose that bond investors cannot observe the issuer’s assets directly, and receive instead only periodic and imperfect accounting reports.

50|$|The {{split between}} the West and Soviet filmmaking became readily {{apparent}} with André Bazin's dismissal of montage and Cahiers du Cinéma's assertion of the primacy of auteurs. The belief that a still, highly composed, and individuated shot marked cinema's artistic significance was an affront to the dialectical method. That individual directors could compose and produce films by themselves (at least in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and authorship) made impossible the collectivization of filmmaking. Eisenstein's later work (Alexander Nevsky 1938 and Ivan the Terrible 1944-1946), would undercut his earlier film's appeal to masses by locating the narrative on a single individual.|$|E

However, because of those close ties to the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) and labour unions, BAWAG was forced to close in 1934 by the Austro-fascist government of Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuß.

The extended model incorporates a default barrier with dynamics {{depending on the}} volatility and the drift of the signaling variable. The level of the barrier is adjusted by a free parameter. We derive a closed-form solution of the defaultable bond price {{as a function of}} a signaling variable and a short-term interest rate, with time-dependent model parameters governing the dynamics of the signaling variable and interest rate. The numerical results calculated from the solution show that the risk adjustable default barrier has material impact on the <b>term</b> structures <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> spreads. The model is capable of producing diverse shape <b>of</b> <b>term</b> structures <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> spreads.
