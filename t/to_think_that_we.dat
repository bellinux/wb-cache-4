People used <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would simply roll over when playing out of India, but we changed the image. [...] Absolutely, and that came from self-belief that, that we had the ability to do well outside India." ...|$|E
500|$|Several Midwestern lawmakers {{commented that}} they {{continued}} to oppose EPA's consideration of the [...] "dicey science" [...] of indirect land use that [...] "punishes domestic fuels". House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson said, [...] "... <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can credibly measure the impact of international indirect land use is completely unrealistic, and I will continue to push for legislation that prevents unreliable methods and unfair standards from burdening the biofuels industry." ...|$|E
500|$|When Geisel {{returned}} to Springfield in 1986 {{as part of}} a publicity tour he was greeted by dozens of children on Mulberry Street. Another group of children held up a banner that read, [...] "And <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> saw him on Mulberry Street". John Fogerty, frontman for the Creedence Clearwater Revival, has stated that the band's song [...] "Lookin' Out My Back Door" [...] was partly inspired by the book.|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, Chris was {{the focus}} of a coward punch storyline. During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole moral of the story is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. I like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can use this story to really educate people and get the word out there that this is something really serious that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had changed forever due to the attack first. Mason added that Chris would have difficulties accepting that someone like Josh attacked him.|$|E

"Mongrels friends, {{it is my}} unbearably sad duty to {{announce}} {{that we will not}} be returning for a third series on BBC Three, a decision that has been made {{based on the fact that}} apparently you need more than two people watching a programme to make it successful. Crazy talk. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at BBC Comedy, BBC Three and BBC Worldwide who have supported us so strongly over the years, and helped us put our silly puppet show on the digital screens of the nation. I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not be less of a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank those of you that loved watching Mongrels as much as we loved making it. It's wonderfully reassuring <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> weren't mad after all, and that what we find funny, other people do too. I'd like to believe that there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there. Who knows, maybe we'll find a that room in the future. I hope it has a minibar. Thank you for watching. Both of you." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortz was {{the first}} guest star the {{producers}} of The Simpsons approached. Long later asked Reagle to make puzzles for the episode. Reagle recorded his lines in a studio near his home. Reagle told the Arizona Daily Wildcat that [...] "for me, {{to be such a}} total nut for animation since I was a kid, I never even dreamed [...] It's like a dream I never had coming true." [...] He added that [...] "you don't see [...] in the episode for very long, but when crossword fans watch this show, we want them <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> got it right." [...] Reagle designed every puzzle that appears in the episode, including one that appears in a hopscotch court in Lisa's daydream. There were certain lines in the script that had to be incorporated into Reagle's puzzles, including one where Gil says [...] "I think I'll throw some Q's around,", and he enters a number of Q's onto the grid. Reagle therefore had to create a puzzle which used words that included the letter Q more frequently than would be usual. Reagle said he saw the early script of the episode, [...] "but they change it right up to the last minute. In a lot of ways, I'll be seeing {{it for the first time}} right along with everyone else." [...] Scott Thompson has a cameo in the episode as Grady, a character that he first voiced in the season 14 episode [...] "Three Gays of the Condo".|$|E

"But {{they pointed}} out," [...] said the lawyer, [...] "that the great American {{fortunes}} {{had been made}} by men who had never had their educational advantages, and they seemed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> what <b>we</b> call the education of a gentleman was a little too good for money-making purposes." ...|$|R

500|$|The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) report 2005 defines {{ecosystem}} services as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet {{is that a}} few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, ants, mosquitoes, and spiders). [...] However, insects offer ecological goods and services. The Xerces Society calculates {{the economic impact of}} four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. [...] "the importance of bugs to hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation, including bird-watching"), dung burial, and pest control. The value has been estimated at $153 billion worldwide. As the ant expert E. O. Wilson observed: [...] "If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos." [...] A Nova (TV Series) segment on the American Public Broadcasting Service framed the relationship with insects in an urban context: [...] "We humans like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> run the world. But even in the heart of our great cities, a rival superpower thrives... These tiny creatures live all around us in vast numbers, though we hardly even notice them. But in many ways, it is they who really run the show. The Washington Post stated: [...] "We are flying blind in many aspects of preserving the environment, and that's why we are so surprised when a species like the honeybee starts to crash, or an insect we don't want, the Asian tiger mosquito or the fire ant, appears in our midst. In other words: Start thinking about the bugs." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this brief paper is to trace {{the origin of the}} {{so-called}} “comparative” suffix in Tungusic languages. Although traditionally seen as a Pan-Tungusic element (only lost in Manchuric), there are very good reasons <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> actually <b>we</b> should deal with two different morphemes whose distribution roughly speaking corresponds to the one between the Northern and Southern (Amuric) Tungusic languages. I aim to offer evidences pointing to a possible Mongolic -Northern Tungusic contact situation as well as an independent genesis in Southern Tungusic. ...|$|R
