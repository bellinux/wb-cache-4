25|$|On 22 August 1922 Collins set {{out from}} Cork City on a {{circuitous}} tour of West Cork. He passed first through Macroom then took the Bandon road via Crookstown. This led through Béal na Bláth, an isolated crossroads. There they stopped at a local pub named 'Long's Pub', now known as The Diamond Bar, {{to ask a question}} of a man standing at the crossroad. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> out to be an anti-Treaty sentry. He and an associate recognised Collins {{in the back of the}} open-top car.|$|E
500|$|George Criticos {{served as}} head porter of the Ritz for 45 years, {{retiring}} in 1960 for health reasons; {{he had been}} recommended for {{a job at the}} Ritz by Sir Basil Zaharoff. In his 1959 book, George of the Ritz, Criticos remembered some of the notable people and events during his years of service. [...] Criticos once acted as an agent to the Aga Kahn at the racetrack, having been given US$45,000 by the monarch to place bets in his name. [...] He was also asked to take the 18-year-old Prince Aly Khan on a monthlong tour of the United States to help the young man forget a failed romance. [...] When Criticos saw an unshaven man in coveralls entering the hotel, he called out to the man to stop him. [...] When <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> to face Criticos, he recognised him as King Boris of Bulgaria, who was a railroad buff and was returning from driving a special train.|$|E
2500|$|The area {{along the}} Goose River {{that is now}} Hillsboro was first settled by German and Norwegian {{settlers}} around 1870. In 1880, the present day site of Hillsboro was founded under the name [...] "Comstock". Local folklore tells {{of the residents of}} nearby Caledonia, North Dakota turning away a shabby surveyor because of his appearance. This man was then offered hospitality by residents in the tiny settlement of Comstock. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> out to be railroad baron James J. Hill.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>turned</b> {{away without}} more words, and {{presently}} Babemba turned {{up with a}} company of about fifty soldiers.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>turned</b> to run {{in every}} direction, blindly, aimlessly, in the dark, like bloodhounds that have lost the trail.|$|R
60|$|Field took it {{and looked}} at it and sounded it. On every side <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>turned</b> face in eager expectancy.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> {{squarely}} {{in their direction}} and addressed them.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> a shade paler {{and cast}} a {{malignant}} glance at Holmes.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> {{his eyes}} away, and Flora Schuyler saw his hands quiver.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis {{a strange}} hallucination," [...] says <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> <b>turning</b> {{to me as}} a more {{reasonable}} lunatic. [...] "Hadn't ye better get him home?" ...|$|R
60|$|Instantly <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>turned,</b> {{and there}} was a general race toward the brig, which lay nearly {{a quarter of a mile}} distant from them.|$|R
6000|$|... "You know they're busted up, sir," [...] said <b>the</b> <b>man,</b> <b>turning</b> to me, as his {{old horse}} hurried us along {{at the best}} of his speed.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> {{and seemed}} by his {{attitude}} to be gazing {{at her in}} astonishment.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> with {{a sudden}} {{resolution}} to punish himself. His voice expressed a terrible loathing.|$|E
60|$|Fairway, Sam, {{and another}} placed their shillings on the table, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> to Christian.|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>turned</b> {{and walked}} slowly away, not waiting to hear the rest. Neither of them spoke during ten minutes; then Cox said, in a vexed tone, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Tom Rover, how do {{you like}} your {{situation}}?" [...] asked Dan, with a sickly smile, as <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>turned</b> away to discuss the situation among themselves.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>turned</b> into {{a resort}} that was half tavern and half restaurant. At the doorway they met another burly fellow who had evidently been {{drinking}} pretty freely.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> {{and faced}} his master. His aspect of dogged civility {{had never been}} more apparent.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned,</b> {{shook his}} brother by the hand, and went, bearing {{the words of}} evil omen.|$|E
60|$|With a few broken {{words of}} {{gratitude}} <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned,</b> but he hesitated {{and then came}} back.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense. It's {{foolish to}} make such talk when we know the thing's impossible," [...] and <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>turned</b> away as if angry at having been brought so far on a useless errand.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>turned</b> and, {{in another}} moment, would have {{carried out the}} order when--from {{a house in a}} line with them, but about fifty yards off--a heavy fire of musketry {{suddenly}} broke out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>turn</b> {{and look}} upon Issus, knowing {{that those of}} the lower orders who gaze upon the holy vision of her radiant face survive the {{blinding}} glory but a single year." ...|$|R
60|$|At this <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> away muttering angrily, and the courtiers murmured their {{approval}} of the Prince's wisdom.|$|E
60|$|Wilmore's {{hand was}} in his pocket but <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> {{deliberately}} away. They {{walked out into the}} street.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{five minutes}} had elapsed before <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> leisurely about, and {{disclosed}} {{the features of}} Prince Florizel of Bohemia.|$|E
50|$|At <b>the</b> conclusion, a <b>man</b> {{tries to}} kill Martha after being seen {{sharpening}} George's razor. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>turns</b> {{out to be}} Gray. George rescues his wife just in time and subdues Gray as the police arrive.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>turns</b> {{around to}} face a huge black plastic bag. The bag seems to contain a {{motionless}} body. Thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> gets off <b>the</b> speed boat and walks on the beach. He is getting some tools to fix the engine.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} he had been {{recognised}} as <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who had routed a whole Turkish company, and was greeted with a laugh and a loud cheer, as <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>turned</b> away and ran to effect some other work of destruction.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> away, {{apparently}} not delighted {{at the prospect}} of wheeling rock, and Geoffrey faced about to greet the spectators.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> {{round and}} looked at his command with a grin. There were seventy of them, all dusty and unkempt.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>turned</b> {{toward my}} aunt, and looked steadfastly at her, {{and as he}} gazed his face grew sadder and sadder.|$|E
60|$|After that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>turns,</b> sudden, to laughing. He {{leans against}} {{a corner and}} laughs considerable. Then he claps me and Tobin {{on the backs of}} us and takes us by an arm apiece.|$|R
6000|$|... "Time's up," [...] {{said one}} of <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> <b>turning</b> {{suddenly}} towards his companions, and allowing {{the light of a}} dark lantern to fall on the face of a watch which he held in his hand.|$|R
50|$|The head couple separate. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>turns</b> {{outwards}} {{and walks}} toward the foot directly behind the men's line, followed by all <b>the</b> <b>men</b> in single file. At {{the same time the}} head lady does the same thing on her side of the set.|$|R
