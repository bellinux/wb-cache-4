25|$|Madonna {{approached}} me. We {{sat for a}} cup of tea {{and again}} {{for a cup of}} tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what I think I can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV, Bow Wow explained how the video relates getting a driver's license {{to being able to}} attract women: [...] "The concept of the video is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to the DMV to get my license. I get in the car and Baby’s my instructor. We’re in Atlanta taking a tour [...] Baby is like, ‘Bow, pull over. Tell this to shorty.’ He tests me on my speaking game with the ladies. A normal DMV person would be testing you on your right turn, [...] ‘check your mirrors.’ Me, I was tested on did I spit game to the girl correctly." ...|$|E
500|$|Marceline is {{voiced by}} Olivia Olson. Olivia's father Martin Olson was an {{acquaintance}} of Ward, and Olivia was encouraged to audition for Adventure Time after Ward told her father that he wanted [...] "her as a voice" [...] on his show. She had originally auditioned {{for the role of}} Princess Bubblegum. After her initial audition, she was asked to read for the role of Marceline, and was [...] "definitely impressed by the character" [...] after seeing design drawings. Martin Olson later noted that Olivia's audition was a [...] "sham" [...] to please the network executives because Ward had already wanted her to be a voice on the show. In order to get into character, Olson often dresses {{in a manner similar to}} Marceline when she records her lines; she explained, [...] "I always find ... that on the days <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> in to record Marceline, I’ll dress like her, in a weird way ... I’ll throw on some rock n’ roll boots, maybe some red lipstick, and just go in there." [...] Olson also is the character's singing voice. According to storyboard artist Cole Sanchez, composers Casey James Basichis and Tim Kiefer produce the bass music that the character performs in the series. Many of the songs written for Marceline were uploaded onto the internet by the writers as well as the production company. For instance, Rob Sugar—the father of former storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar—often uploaded demos of songs written for Marceline by Rebecca. Furthermore, Frederator also posted demos, as well as a full version of the popular [...] "Fry Song", sung by Marceline in the episode [...] "It Came from the Nightosphere", on its official blog. In flashback sequences, younger Marceline is voiced by Ava Acres. In the fifth season episodes [...] "Finn the Human" [...] / [...] "Jake the Dog", an older, alternate universe version of the character is voiced by Cloris Leachman. Martin Olson also provides the voice for Marceline's demonic father Hunson Abadeer. Olivia Olson later noted that the opportunity to voice act with her father was [...] "pretty cool”.|$|E

2500|$|Rowling {{said that}} the death of Sydney Carton in Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities, and the novel's final line, [...] "It is a far, far better thing that I do than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to than I have ever known", had a {{profound}} impact on her.|$|E
2500|$|I {{find that}} I am [...] "intermediate" [...] between God and nothingness, between the supreme entity and nonentity. Insofar as I am the {{creation}} of the supreme entity, there's nothing in me to account for my being deceived or led into error, but, inasmuch as I somehow participate in nothing or nonentity — that is, insofar as I am distinct from the supreme entity itself and lack many things — it's not surprising <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> wrong. I thus understand that, in itself, error is a lack, rather than a real thing dependent on God. Hence, I understand that I can err without God's having given me a special ability to do so. Rather, I fall into error because my God-given ability to judge the truth is not infinite. [...] (Descartes, Meditation IV: On Truth and Falsity).|$|E
2500|$|Just as Lancashire's tail {{had pushed}} {{on at the}} end of their innings, so did Somerset's on the third day. Blackwell made his second century in two innings, finally {{surrendering}} on 122. The second-highest scorer was Richard Johnson with 40. Blackwell explained, [...] "I've changed a few things this year and started to bat on off stump. A lot of bowlers have been going across me because they know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> at widish balls. The ball's now closer to me if it's slanted across and I'm backing my hand-eye co-ordination to avoid being lbw." [...] The day itself was very cold, with Blackwell saying, [...] "It was absolutely perishing out there. I think play should be abandoned if it gets that cold." [...] After Somerset were dismissed for 272, six Somerset men came out to field sporting woollen hats. Bad light and rain meant the day ended at 2.07pm, with Lancashire on 33 for 1, 84 runs ahead. Whilst a Lancashire victory was not out of the question, the most likely result was the draw.|$|E

2500|$|On 15 November leading Whigs met Pitt and Lord Grenville {{to discuss}} the situation. No record was kept of this meeting except by Fitzwilliam, and by Lord Grenville in March 1795. According to Fitzwilliam they decided that: [...] "Roman Catholick [...] not to be brought forward by Government, that the {{discussion}} of the propriety may be left open". Fitzwilliam claimed this meant that whilst the administration would not put forward Emancipation, they would not obstruct it should it pass the Irish Parliament. Lord Grenville however interpreted the meeting as deciding that Fitzwilliam [...] "should, as much as possible, endeavour to prevent the agitation of the question during the present session; and that, in all events, he should do nothing in it which might commit the king's government here or in Ireland without fresh instructions from hence". On 18 November Fitzwilliam wrote to Burke to reassure him: [...] "the business is settled: <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to Ireland—though not exactly upon the terms I had originally thought of, and I mean particularly in the removal of the Chancellor, who is now to remain, Grattan and the Ponsonbys desire me to accept: I left the decision to them".|$|E
