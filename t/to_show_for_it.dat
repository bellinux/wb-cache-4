5|$|Boudreau placed Gromek in the {{starting}} rotation to begin the 1949 Cleveland Indians season, giving the team a big four of Feller, Bob Lemon, Gene Bearden, and Gromek, who had spent the past year working on his curveball to help him improve on his 1948 season. In his first start of the season, he allowed two hits in an 8–2 victory against the Browns. By the end of May, he had an ERA of 2.80, which was among the lowest on the team, but only had a 2–4 record <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> {{due to a lack}} of run support; the four losses included both a 1–0 and 2–0 defeat. With the increased productivity of Early Wynn and Mike Garcia, Gromek fell out of favor with Boudreau, and he was moved primarily to relief duty. After being pulled in the second inning in a July 16 start against the Athletics, he was kept as a reliever the rest of the year. Gromek finished the season with four wins, six losses, and a 3.33 ERA in 92 innings over 27 games, 12 of them starts.|$|E

Modern theology tries to illuminate the nature of religion and <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> what <b>it</b> is, we can find out that modern theology has much to offer us in our task of devising a form of religious education which is meaningful and relevant to the child we teach. The article shows that the teaching of beliefs as if they were facts would constitute indoctrination rather than education. This situation and approach can be suitable for the members of church but not for professionals from pedagogic. The educational validity of a mode of thought, on of a subject, also depends, on how far it possible to teach it a way which ensures understanding and promotes cognitive perspective. In such circumstances religious education should be able to help young people to clarify problems concerning the changes of modes of thinking and various beliefs. The acceptance of World Religions {{as an integral part of}} religious education at all stages is the cause of disputes among scientists, but the longer this takes the more our society becomes pluralistic, multi-cultural, and so the need for change becomes more necessary...|$|R

500|$|Although Burnham {{had lived}} {{all over the}} world, {{he never had a}} great deal of wealth <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>for</b> his efforts. <b>It</b> was not until he {{returned}} to California, the place of his youth, that he found great affluence. In November 1923, he struck oil in Dominguez Hills, near Carson, California.

In the first 10 years of operation, the Burnham Exploration Company paid out $10.2 million in dividends. The spot where Burnham found oil was land where [...] "as a small boy he used to graze cattle, and shoot game which he sold to the neighboring mining districts to support his widowed mother and infant brother." [...] Many years after the oil was depleted, the land near the Dominguez field was re-developed and became the site of the California State University, Dominguez Hills. In 2010, Occidental Petroleum Corporation expressed interest in redeveloping the former Dominguez oil field using modern extraction technologies.|$|R

40|$|Although most {{simulation}} {{practitioners are}} aware that output analysis is of extreme importance in a discrete-event system simulation, many are not versed in the process for conducting that analysis. Hence, {{it is not unusual}} that a simulation practitioner will conduct just one replication of the simulation, and provide the resulting measure-of-performance as the estimated response. Point estimates like this can be very dangerous, since they represent but one of many possible values of an experiment when random variation is present. It is much more appropriate to provide a statistical confidence interval, as a minimal form of output analysis. This article uses an example that describes a context in which variation in output performance measures can occur. The actual output from a simulation of that example system is used to develop confidence intervals. The output features of simulation software are briefly described. This is followed by a listing of these same output features and their availability on five simulation software products. The intention of the article is to draw attention to simulation output analysis and <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that support <b>for</b> <b>it</b> is readily available in simulation software.

2500|$|Author Richard Webster {{comments}} in A Brief History of Blasphemy (1990) that [...] "internalised censorship {{played a significant}} role in the handling" [...] of Monty Python's Life of Brian. In his view, [...] "As a satire on religion, this film might well be considered a rather slight production. As blasphemy it was, even in its original version, extremely mild. Yet the film was surrounded from its inception by intense anxiety, in some quarters of the Establishment, about the offence it might cause. As a result it gained a certificate for general release only after some cuts had been made. Perhaps more importantly still, the film was shunned by the BBC and ITV, who declined <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> fear of offending Christians in the UK. Once again a blasphemy was restrained – or its circulation effectively curtailed – not by the force of law but by the internalisation of this law." [...] On its initial release in the UK, the film was banned by several town councils – some of which had no cinemas within their boundaries, or had not even seen the film. A member of Harrogate council, one of those that banned the film, revealed during a television interview that the council had not seen the film, and had based their opinion on what they had been told by the Nationwide Festival of Light, a grouping with an evangelical Christian base, of which they knew nothing.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A new, {{computer}} oriented {{system for}} automatic, in situ monitoring of water quality is proposed which makes full and {{effective use of}} modern computer technology. The main objective of this thesis work was {{the development of the}} concept for in situ computer controlled experimenting as a reasonable and effective means of automatically observing the wide range of aquatic parameters needed. The established capability in the teleprocessing industry is assumed as starting point and an optimal design is sought for a sensing head which would meet current expression of requirements for automated water quality monitors while exploiting the advantages of both hardware and software in a total system context. A working model of such a sensing head was constructed and operationally tested using an EAI 690 hybrid computer to simulate the central computer and telecommunications facility. This sensing head consisted of a peristaltic pump, a servo positioned valve, an array of six electrodes (2 glass pH, 3 silver-silver chloride and 1 gold microelectrode) and a thermistor, along with buffer amplifiers and motor controllers to service these devices. A main feature is its design as a remote, computer periferal, like a teletype, which understands up to 64 different commands and which returns coded responses. A second feature is its in situ design making the entire sensor head submersible and operable in depths to 100 meters. A repertoire of programmed experiments was developed for the working model system <b>to</b> <b>show</b> how, <b>for</b> example, <b>it</b> could monitor the water quality parameters; temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, chloride ion, total carbon dioxide, total alkalinity, and a factor called "other ions". The last three in the list being derived from a novel titrametric method, that could be implemented in the particular set of devices in the model sensing head. Concepts of autovarification and autocalibration are introduced and applied with some success. Examples of data (taken at 1 / 2 meter or 100 meter submergence) for known test solutions and local river water are presented and discussed. It is concluded that the proposed concept is both practical and feasible, having an almost open ended potential to monitor parameters for which sensors per se are not now available, and to do this with high levels of confirmed data return...|$|R

Both duelists were wounded, Casanova on the left hand. The hand recovered on its own, after Casanova refused the recommendation of doctors that it be amputated. From Warsaw, he traveled to Breslau in the Kingdom of Prussia, then to Dresden, where he contracted yet another venereal infection. He returned to Paris for several months in 1767 and hit the gambling salons, only to be expelled from France by order of Louis XV himself, primarily for Casanova's scam involving the Marquise d'Urfé. Now known across Europe for his reckless behavior, Casanova would have difficulty overcoming his notoriety and gaining any fortune. So he headed for Spain, where he was not as well known. He tried his usual approach, leaning on well-placed contacts (often Freemasons), wining and dining with nobles of influence, and finally arranging an audience with the local monarch, in this case Charles III.

Grimes rants about Homer to Lenny and Carl, both of whom insist that despite his faults, Homer is essentially a decent person. To prove Homer's lack of intelligence, he tricks Homer into entering a nuclear power plant design contest intended for children, by carefully cutting away all references to them in a promotional poster which he leaves at Homer's control panel. Homer, unaware that the contest is only open to kids, eagerly takes on the challenge to prove his professionalism. At the contest, Grimes is horrified when Homer's model, which is almost exactly the same as the current power plant with only a few modifications, easily wins against Ralph Wiggum's Malibu Stacy dream house, and Martin Prince's futuristic model that supplies power to the room. The audience's applause and cheers for Homer cause Grimes to finally snap and he runs amok through the plant, mimicking and mocking Homer's habits. Entering Homer's office, Grimes sees a machine labeled [...] "Extremely High Voltage", sarcastically declares that he does not need safety gloves because he's Homer Simpson, grabs the high voltage wires and is fatally electrocuted.

500|$|One {{of their}} most notable episodes was [...] "Homer's Enemy", an episode {{designed}} to [...] "push the envelope conceptually."

The result was the character of Frank Grimes, a man who has had to work hard all his life with nothing <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance. [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; in some scenes, his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering [...] "real American hero," [...] is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious. Oakley says the episode was [...] "hyper-meta" [...] and focused on [...] "parodying to some degree the Homer we don't like. That's {{one of the things that}} episode is supposed to illustrate– 'Homer gone wrong'. Although, I would argue that in 'Homer's Enemy' he's not even really even all that excessively stupid or immature, actually." [...] Weinstein said: [...] "We wanted to do an episode where the thinking was 'What if a real life, normal person had to enter Homer's universe and deal with him?' I know this episode is controversial and divisive, but I just love it. It really feels like what would happen if a real, somewhat humorless human had to deal with Homer. There was some talk [...] about the ending—we just did that because (a) it’s really funny and shocking, (2) we like the lesson of 'sometimes, you just can't win'—the whole Frank Grimes episode is a study in frustration and hence Homer has the last laugh and (3) we wanted to show that in real life, being Homer Simpson could be really dangerous and life threatening, as Frank Grimes sadly learned." [...] When the episode was first broadcast, many fans felt it was too dark, unfunny and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered. On the DVD commentary, Weinstein considers this episode one of the most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which many fans [...] "didn't get." [...] Weinstein talks about a [...] "generation gap"—the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show.|$|E
