5|$|Jeter {{committed}} 18 {{errors in}} 2007, his highest total since finishing with 24 in 2000. After the season, Cashman {{and his staff}} saw Jeter's defense as an area <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> addressed. At the Yankees' request, Jeter embarked on a rigorous training program to combat the effects of age, by focusing on lateral movement and first-step quickness. Jeter's ultimate zone rating (UZR) improved from worst in the AL for shortstops in 2007 to close to league average in 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, the Scottish {{shipbuilder}} John Elder {{published an}} article that advocated that widening the beam of a ship would reduce the area <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> protected {{and allow it to}} carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a normal ship. In addition such a ship would have a shallower draught and only a moderate increase in power would be required to match the speed of a normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder's conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder's concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design flat-bottomed, unlike Elder's convex hull, to minimise its draught.|$|E
5|$|Isle Verde, where {{approximately}} 2,300people were killed, {{was declared}} uninhabitable by officials; however, residents still {{returned to the}} area due to a need for land. Eventually, signs that used to warn people not {{to stay on the}} islet were eventually taken down and people were no longer warned not to live there. A resettlement community was constructed months later, with plans to house 912 of the 2,668families <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moved from the area. Those that were not moved were left on Isle Verde despite orders not to stay there. Another resettlement project for 700families was planned at the cost of $1million.|$|E

5|$|It was Shea's {{responsibility}} {{to bring that}} engineering discipline to North American and to NASA's management of its contractors. His systems management experience served him well in his new post. In the coming years, any change {{to the design of}} the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Joe Shea. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself—a looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E
5|$|NFL postseason {{history can}} be traced to the first NFL Championship Game in 1933, though in the early years, {{qualification}} for the game was based solely on regular season records. From 1933 to 1966, the NFL postseason generally only consisted of the NFL Championship Game, pitting the league's two division winners (pending any one-game playoff matches <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> held to break ties in the division standings). The NFL playoffs then expanded in 1967, when four teams qualified for the tournament. When the league merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970, the playoffs expanded to eight teams. The playoffs were expanded to 10 teams in 1978 and 12 teams since 1990.|$|E

5|$|Quarrying in Giffnock {{continued}} until 1912 when, due to flooding {{and the high}} cost of extracting stone, work ceased. Numerous ventures tried to revitalise the quarries for other purposes, including the cultivation of mushrooms in the tunnels. As the pits began to fill with water, it became an issue <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved. In the early 1930s, William Bearmore & Co began tipping slag from the production of steel into the Giffnock quarries. The slag tipping {{continued until}} 1969, when Derek Crouch Limited began scrap metal extraction, which lasted until the late 1970s. Today the ground is a wasteland.|$|E
5|$|The {{budget of}} about £1million per episode (totalling US$9.6million) allowed 20 {{shooting}} weeks of {{five days to}} film six 55-minute episodes. Production aimed for 10.5-hour shooting days plus time for costume and make-up. Two weeks before filming began, about 70 of {{the cast and crew}} gathered for the script read-through, followed by rehearsals, lessons for dancing, horse-riding, fencing, and other skills <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ready ahead of the actual filming. Filming took place between June 1994 and 1 November 1994 to reflect the changing seasons in the plot, followed by post-production until mid-May 1995. Scenes in the same place were grouped in the filming schedule.|$|E

5|$|The {{first half}} was dull. Brugge held back, using tight marking and the offside trap to {{restrict}} Liverpool's attacking threat. Towards {{the end of}} the first half, Liverpool started to have more scoring chances. Ray Kennedy volleyed across the face of the goal, and Jimmy Case took a free kick <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> punched away by Brugge goalkeeper Birger Jensen. In the closing minutes of the first half, Jensen made two crucial saves: he blocked David Fairclough, who had made a run towards goal, and he tipped a header by Alan Hansen over the crossbar. So the score at half-time was 0–0.|$|E
5|$|The worst {{loss of life}} in United States history due to a {{wildfire}} {{occurred in}} 1871 when the Peshtigo Fire swept through Wisconsin, killing more than 1500 people. The Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889 in California and especially the Great Fire of 1910 in Montana and Idaho contributed to the philosophy that fire was a danger <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> suppressed. The Great Fire of 1910 burned , destroyed a number of communities and killed 86 people, and this event prompted various land management agencies to emphasize wildfire suppression. U.S. Government land agencies, including the National Park Service, generally followed the fire management policies established by the U.S. Forest Service, which oversees {{the majority of the}} nation's forestlands.|$|E
5|$|A port of {{the game}} for the PlayStation 3 was {{announced}} in April 2009. The port features full voice acting, containing nearly twice as much voice work as the original voice script, which covers previously unvoiced cutscenes in the 360 version. The game also features various new characters, has Flynn as a permanent playable character, and adds a new playable character {{in the form of}} Patty Fleur. Development on the port began in 2008, after the release of the original version. Speaking on why the port was being developed, a developer who worked on Vampire Rain said that companies like Namco Bandai first developed for the Xbox 360 due to superior funding and development support when compared to Sony, then ported to PS3 with minimal effort so they could recoup development costs and add features <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cut from the original game.|$|E

5|$|By 1838 it {{had become}} clear that {{construction}} costs for the town were spiralling out of control. To make matters worse, the railway's engineer informed Hesketh-Fleetwood {{that the cost of}} the railway was expected to exceed £300,000. The company had also sold far fewer shares than had been hoped. Frederick Kemp was collecting rents and rates from tenants, and Hesketh-Fleetwood repeatedly asked him for money to pay some of the mounting bills. Kemp, a more forceful character than his employer, kept claiming that there was no money. Hesketh-Fleetwood turned to his brother Charles and asked him to get £4,000 out of Kemp. Charles was more assertive, but Kemp said that the money had been spent on workers' wages and produced yet more invoices <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> paid. During Hesketh-Fleetwood's many absences from the Fylde, Kemp managed to involve himself in a number of enterprises in the town, to his own financial advantage. The railway was taking longer than expected and, with mounting debts, Hesketh-Fleetwood grew increasingly depressed and began to withdraw from society.|$|E
5|$|Casey {{returned}} to Washington, D.C. in October 1940 to become {{chief of the}} Design and Engineering Section in the Construction Division of the Office of the Quartermaster General, under Brigadier General Brehon B. Somervell. An enormous construction program was underway {{to meet the needs}} of World War II. Working with a staff that included George Bergstrom, a former president of the American Institute of Architects, Casey set about revising the standard designs for barracks. A number of new features were added to improve comfort, safety, and durability. Substitutions were made for scarce materials. It was discovered that the standard 63-man barracks was now too small. Of the 81 companies in the new triangular division, 51 fitted more easily into 74-man barracks. By slightly increasing the barracks size, substantial savings were made by reducing the overall number of buildings <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constructed, the size of the cantonment areas required, and the length of required roads and utility lines. Casey was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 8 April 1941.|$|E
5|$|From December 12, 1994, to January 2000, the PGSO did not hire any new deputies or {{civilian}} employees, {{leaving the}} agency with 92 vacant positions <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> filled. Over that period, 66 deputies left the agency, some retiring routinely, others leaving {{due to increased}} workloads caused by vacant positions. In some cases, deputies worked sixteen hours in one day, eight in courtrooms, and eight serving warrants. In December 1994, the agency had 248 deputies, whereas on January 20, 2000, it only had 192 deputies, with 20 leaving from November 1998 to January 2000. In July 1996, the county government decreased the amount of funding the PGSO was receiving. Unlike the PGPD at the time, the PGSO was not nationally accredited and still is not, as of January 2015. Computers were also in short supply, and the few that were in use were outdated and obsolete.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} Canada's role in the Afghanistan War, {{concerns}} were raised about the stringency of the criteria <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> met to receive the Victoria Cross. Other countries with a Victoria Cross had awarded it numerous times {{since the end of}} the Second World War, some members of the Australian, New Zealand, and British armed forces receiving the decoration for their actions during the Afghan and Iraq wars of the 2000s. Members of the Canadian Armed Forces questioned why some actions by Canadians were deemed worthy only of the Star of Military Valour; citations for individuals who'd received the imperial Victoria Cross during the First World War were very similar to those for Canadians who were presented with the Star of Military Valour during the war in Afghanistan. This led then Chief of the Defence Staff, Walter Natynczyk, to create a special committee to review the matter. The Department of National Defence's Directorate of Honours and Recognition explained concepts of war had changed since the mid-20th century and Canada had also developed a more elaborate honours system.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1902, Geier began a long cruise {{south to}} the Dutch East Indies, which also {{included}} a stop in Singapore. The ship entered the dry dock in Nagasaki, Japan, for a major overhaul on 2 March 1903, which lasted until 26 April. At this time, Geier was formally assigned to the East Asia Squadron. The ship resumed its normal routine of cruises in East Asian waters with stops in various ports. In February 1904, the Russo-Japanese War broke out; from April to August, Geier was in Chemulpo, which had been captured by the Japanese. By 1905, the ship was suffering wear, having spent over seven years on foreign stations. The repair facilities in Tsingtao were insufficient {{for the amount of}} work <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done, and so Geier was ordered to return to Germany. She left Tsingtao on 14 January and arrived in Kiel on 16 March, where she was decommissioned for a significant period of repair work. Her three-masted schooner barque rig was reduced to a two-masted topsail schooner rig.|$|E
5|$|One 135-minute {{practice}} session {{was held on}} Friday morning before the Saturday afternoon race. Alex Tagliani was fastest in the session, {{which took place in}} dry, warm weather conditions, with a lap of 24.811 seconds; Tora Takagi was second, and da Matta third. Francitti was fourth-fastest, and Carpentier rounded out the session's top five drivers. Seven yellow caution flags were shown: the first two were for track inspections, the next two were for debris located in turns three and four. The fifth caution was for Shinji Nakano who stopped at the bottom of turns three and four with smoke billowing from his engine which dropped oil on the track <b>that</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cleaned. The sixth was caused by Michel Jourdain Jr. when his engine failed and stopped between turns three and four and his car was extracted from the circuit, and the final was for Scott Dixon who slowed on the backstretch with a loss of engine power.|$|E
