The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is developing EOSDIS {{as part of its}} Mission-To-Planet-Earth (MTPE) project to accept instrument/platform observation requests from end-user scientists, schedule and perform requested observations of the Earth from space, collect and process the observed data, and distribute data to scientists and archives. Current requirements for the system are managed with tools that allow developers to trace the relationships between requirements and other development artifacts, including other requirements. In addition, the user community (e. g., earth and atmospheric scientists), in conjunction with NASA, has generated scenarios describing the actions of EOSDIS subsystems in response to user requests and other system activities. As part of a research effort in verification and validation techniques, this paper describes our efforts to develop <b>requirements</b> <b>tables</b> from these scenarios for the EOSDIS Core System (ECS). The tables specify event-driven mode transitions based on techniques developed by the Naval Research Lab's (NRL) Software Cost Reduction (SCR) project. The SCR approach has proven effective in specifying requirements for large systems in an unambiguous, terse format that enhance identification of incomplete and inconsistent requirements. We describe development of SCR tables from user scenarios and identify {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} our approach in contrast to the requirements tracing approach. We also evaluate the capabilities of both approach to respond to the volatility of requirements in large, complex systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Requirements {{engineering}} {{is an important}} phase in a system’s life cycle. When poorly performed, various problems may occur, such as failures, cost overrun and delays. The increasing complexity of systems makes require-ments engineering activities both more important and more difficult. Model-driven engineering, in which models are the main artifact during system development, is an emergent approach that tries to address system complexity by the intense use of models. This article proposes a model-driven approach to requirements engineering based on SysML Requirements and Use Case Diagrams. The main advantages are that user requirements are graphically modeled, their relationships are explicitly mapped, and system decomposi-tion is considered in the early system development activities. In addition, requirements traceability is enhanced by using the SysML <b>Requirements</b> <b>tables.</b> The approach is illustrated by a list of user requirements for a road traffic management system...|$|R

In this project, we implemented NetFPGA-based OpenFlow Capsulator module and tested its performance. This hardware Capsulator shows enhanced performance compared to the user-level software Capsulator. On the given testbed network, we deployed programmable service composition and QoS routing function at the OpenFlow controller based on user requirements and network status. According to the QoS routing algorithm, optimal routing path can be calculated using service <b>requirements</b> <b>table</b> and network monitoring components.

40|$|The work {{deals with}} the problem of changes in the {{relative}} prices of industrial outputs due to the imposition of a tax. Furthermore, the imposition of a tax induces changes in all of the components of the input-output table. The magnitude of the changes {{is a function of the}} degree of forward shifting of the tax under consideration. Although the analysis can be applied to any tax with due consideration to its shifting characteristics, the wellhead tax was selected as an illustrative example for several reasons. The tax has been proposed as an alternative to the existing system of controls and entitlements imposed on the production of crude oil in the United States after the oil embargo of 1974. The wellhead tax is equivalent to the tax on profits when the elasticity of supply of crude oil is zero. The tax on profits in another alternative which has been proposed to replace the system of controls and entitlements. The input-output tables of the U. S. Department of Commerce were analyzed in regard to their sources of data and methods of construction. From this analysis the conclusion was reached that the only possible interpretation of the tables is in "value" terms. That is, dollars for the transactions table and dollars per dollar for the direct <b>requirements</b> <b>table.</b> Three philosophically different methods were developed to analyze the price effects and to recompute the direct <b>requirements</b> <b>table.</b> The three methods yield identical results. The treatment of direct and indirect taxes in the American tables does not agree with accepted concepts of shifting in public finance. Namely, in the tables, indirect taxes are fully shifted forward while direct taxes are not shifted. In this work, simulations were run assuming different percentages of forward shifting for the wellhead tax. Comparison of the results, with analysis by Robert E. Hall, indicates that his study is equivalent to a sixty percent forward shifting of the tax. The analysis of the American input-output tables indicates that studies of tax incidence assuming constant input-output coefficients, such as the study by Henry Aaron, are logically inconsistent for any degree of forward shifting other than zero...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} compositional and incremental type {{checking for}} object-oriented programming languages. Recent work achieved incremental type checking for structurally typed functional languages through co-contextual typing rules, a constraint-based formulation that removes any context dependency for expression typings. However, that work {{does not cover}} key features of object-oriented languages: Subtype polymorphism, nominal typing, and implementation inheritance.

In the present work, we demonstrate that an appropriate co-contextual notion to class tables exists, paving the way to efficient incremental type checkers for object-oriented languages. This yields a novel formulation of Igarashi et al. 2 ̆ 7 s Featherweight Java (FJ) type system, where we replace class tables by the dual concept of class <b>table</b> <b>requirements</b> and class <b>table</b> operations by dual operations on class <b>table</b> <b>requirements.</b> We prove the equivalence of FJ 2 ̆ 7 s type system and our co-contextual formulation.
