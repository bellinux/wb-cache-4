25|$|Real estate trade groups, in response, {{claim that}} the {{abatement}} program makes it feasible to build residential housing in the first place. John Banks, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, claimed that the high construction costs, expensive land, and tax increases would make construction unfeasible without <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>break.</b> One developer also claimed {{that they would be}} more likely to construct condos instead of rentals without the tax abatement because the differential would make condos comparably more profitable. The developer claimed that affordable rental units would take a hit without the 421-a program.|$|E

25|$|However, {{debate over}} how much the program helped to develop {{affordable}} housing in the city continued. Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, along with other advocacy groups, worried {{that the loss of}} <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> would make affordable housing too expensive to build in the city, and that the city would have to pay more to build such units. From when Mayor de Blasio took office in January 2014 to the expiration of the program in January 2016, developers received financing for 13,929 affordable units, of which 5,006 utilized the 421-a abatement program. In response to this issue, Governor Cuomo brought both union leaders and real estate executives together to create a deal on paying union-level wages on 421-a projects. At the conclusion of negotiations, unions and real estate developers reached an agreement to pay workers $60/hr on covered projects in Manhattan and $45/hr on covered projects within a mile of the East River waterfront in Queens and Brooklyn. As such, the bill was submitted to the state legislature for approval. The program was officially revived with the passage of New York State's $153.1 billion budget in April 2017.|$|E
2500|$|... 421-a tax {{abatement}} is {{a property}} tax abatement {{in the state}} of New York that is given to real estate developers for building new multi-family residential housing buildings. The program gets its name from being from section 421-a in the New York Real Property Tax Law. The 421-a program began in 1971, and has since included provisions in it to mandate the creation of affordable housing units in order to qualify for the program. Under the original program, areas in which developers qualified for <b>the</b> <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> included all of Manhattan and portions of the rest of New York City. The original program lapsed in January 2016 after disagreements between the state government and the New York City government, but a deal was made in November 2016 between unions, developers, and Governor Andrew Cuomo to bring it back, pending the approval of the New York State Legislature. In the April 2017 budget negotiations, the program was officially renewed, with the official new program name being [...] "Affordable New York". The program is administered by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD). Under the program, the city government stands to lose billions of dollars in foregone property tax revenue, making this program controversial.|$|E
