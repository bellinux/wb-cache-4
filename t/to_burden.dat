5|$|Iwane Matsui {{was born}} in Nagoya on July 27, 1878. He was the sixth son of Takekuni Matsui, an impoverished samurai and former {{retainer}} to the daimyō of Owari during the Tokugawa shogunate. After completing elementary school, his parents insisted that he continue his education, but Matsui worried about his father's debts {{and did not want}} <b>to</b> <b>burden</b> him financially. Though he was a short, thin, and sickly young man, Matsui opted for a career in the Army, because in Japan at that time military schools charged the lowest tuition fees.|$|E

Unwilling <b>to</b> <b>burden</b> them, ultimately Soegiati decides to leave and find her own way, depending on the kindness of strangers. Years pass, and Soemadi returns from exile. Encountering his mother, who now lives in poverty, he decides to take revenge on his brothers.|$|E

5|$|When the {{government}} seeks <b>to</b> <b>burden</b> a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, {{the government}} provide the person notice, {{an opportunity to}} be heard at an oral hearing, and a decision by a neutral decision maker. For example, such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits. The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to recuse themselves in cases where the judge has a conflict of interest. For example, in Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. (2009), the Court ruled that a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} crisis and recession that hit the Philippines in the 1980s did not spare UE. The devaluation of the peso, rising inflation, {{the high cost of}} wages, coupled with faculty, personnel and student strikes affected UE. Enrollment declined. This period intensified into a crisis that almost led to the school's being sold to a foreign religious group. Financial trouble and academic decline continued <b>to</b> <b>burden</b> UE throughout the 1980s. For a brief period in 1984, a controlling interest in the university was held by an entity of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation movement. Students boycotted classes and held protests against the takeover, and in short time control was returned to stakeholders.|$|E

Scandals involving the directors, shareholders and others emerged in 2005–06 season and included allegations of blackmail and threats of violence against the club's chairman Gianni Paladini. In an unrelated incident QPR were further rocked by the murder of youth team player Kiyan Prince on 18 May 2006 and, in August 2007, the death of teenager and promising first-team player Ray Jones in a car crash.|$|E
500|$|The first {{transfer}} {{for which}} Manchester United (then Newton Heath) {{had to pay}} a fee was the transfer of Gilbert Godsmark from Ashford in January 1900. Manchester United paid Ashford a fee of £40 for Godsmark. The club's first £1,000 transfer came in 1910, when they signed Leslie Hofton from Glossop. When the club signed Tommy Taylor from Barnsley in 1953, the fee {{was intended to be}} £30,000. However, Matt Busby did not want <b>to</b> <b>burden</b> the young player with the [...] "£30,000 man" [...] tag, and Barnsley agreed for the fee to be reduced by £1 to £29,999.

500|$|The [...] "Time Beetle", {{which was}} {{responsible}} for the creation of the alternate universe, was described in the episode's script as [...] "a huge black beetle... shiny carapace, spindly black legs moving and flexing, mandibles clacking together". Its design was influenced by the Giant Spider of Metebelis 3 that clung to Sarah Jane Smith's back in Planet of the Spiders. The beetle's normal Earth-like appearance was deliberate; prosthetic designer Niell Gorton thought that familiarity would ease the narrative and cited the cat nuns from [...] "New Earth" [...] and the Judoon from [...] "Smith and Jones" [...] as examples. The prosthetic was made using fibreglass and fitted on a harness in order not <b>to</b> <b>burden</b> Catherine Tate's performance. The episode's director Graeme Harper explained in the episode's commentary that only psychic characters such as Lucius from [...] "The Fires of Pompeii" [...] were aware of the beetle's existence.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Quistis {{stayed at}} an orphanage {{with most of}} the main characters. She then lived with foster parents, with whom she never {{developed}} any intimacy, before moving to Balamb Garden [...] at age ten. She became a SeeD at fifteen and an instructor two years later. Quistis initially joins Squall to prepare him for his upcoming field exam. She later takes Squall into her confidence and tells him personally about her demotion. As a result, Squall stops paying attention to her, which leads to Quistis asking if he is paying attention. Squall rudely tells her to go [...] "talk to a wall", a famous comical line in the game, and not <b>to</b> <b>burden</b> him with her problems. This furthers the player's perception of Squall's awkwardness and anti-social tendencies. When Irvine refreshes the main characters' memories about the orphanage, they remember that Squall's asocial behavior began when Ellone, an older sister figure to Squall, left the orphanage unexpectedly. As a result of these revelations, Quistis recognizes that her feelings for Squall are more sisterly than romantic. Later, she criticizes Squall when he nearly abandons Rinoa, his romantic interest.|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} to England, Cobham kept this {{information}} from the full MCC committee, knowing {{that they would be}} forced to cancel the tour if they became aware of it. Instead, he wrote a letter to a committee member, whose identity has never been made public. The letter's recipient passed it on to Griffith, who in turn showed it to Allen and Arthur Gilligan, at that time the MCC president. These three men chose to hide the information from the full committee, and nobody informed Denis Howell. Allen later defended these actions, setting out his reasoning in his biography, which was written by his close friend Swanton—Allen argued that the advice given by Douglas-Home, an international diplomat, took precedence over Cobham's information and had already been accepted by the MCC. He further suggested that, as the four England selectors had to choose the team [...] "without any other consideration", and two of them sat on the MCC committee, it would have been unfair <b>to</b> <b>burden</b> them with Cobham's information. Oborne dismisses Allen's reasoning as [...] "disastrously muddled", pointing out that Cobham's advice was far more up-to-date than Douglas-Home's, and that {{there would have been no}} burden of conscience for the team selectors as the new information would have caused the tour to be cancelled.|$|E
