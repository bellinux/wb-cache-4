30|$|The {{cumulative}} distribution function (CDF) of the T-X family is given by R{W(F(x))}, where R is the CDF of a random variable T, F is the CDF of X and W is an increasing function defined on [0, 1] having the support of <b>T</b> <b>as</b> <b>its</b> range. This family provides a new method of generating univariate distributions. Different choices of the R, F and W functions naturally lead to different families of distributions. This paper proposes the use of quantile functions to define the W function. Some general properties of this T-X system of distributions are studied. It is shown that several existing methods of generating univariate continuous distributions can be derived using this T-X system. Three new distributions of the T-X family are derived, namely, the normal-Weibull based on the quantile of Cauchy distribution, normal-Weibull based on the quantile of logistic distribution, and Weibull-uniform based on the quantile of log-logistic distribution. Two real data sets are applied to illustrate {{the flexibility of the}} distributions.|$|E

Bacterial strain RG 3 T, {{isolated}} from Kombucha tea, displays both of these characteristics. A high bootstrap value in the 16 S rRNA gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis supported the position of this strain within the genus Gluconacetobacter, with Gluconacetobacter hansenii LMG 1527 <b>T</b> <b>as</b> <b>its</b> nearest neighbour (99. 1 % sequence similarity).

40|$|Despite the {{diversity}} of Burkholderia species known to nodulate legumes in introduced and native regions, relatively few taxa have been formally described. For example, the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa is thought to represent {{one of the major}} centres of diversity for the rhizobial members of Burkholderia, yet only five species have been described from legumes occurring in this region and numerous are still awaiting taxonomic treatment. Here, we investigated the taxonomic status of 12 South African root-nodulating Burkholderia isolates from native papilionoid legumes (Hypocalyptus coluteoides, H. oxalidifolius, H. sophoroides and Virgilia oroboides). Analysis of four gene regions (16 S rRNA, recA, atpD and rpoB) revealed that the isolates represent a genealogically unique and exclusive assemblage within the genus. Its distinctness was supported by all other aspects of the polyphasic approach utilized, including the genome-based criteria DNA−DNA hybridization (≥ 70. 9 %) and average nucleotide identities (≥ 96 %). We accordingly propose the name B. kirstenboschensis sp. nov. for this taxon with isolate Kb 15 T (=LMG 28727 T; =SARC 695 <b>T)</b> <b>as</b> <b>its</b> type strain. Our data showed that intraspecific genome size differences (≥ 0. 81 Mb) and the occurrence of large DNA regions that are apparently unique to single individuals (16 − 23 % of an isolate's genome) can significantly limit the value of data obtained from DNA−DNA hybridization experiments. Substitution of DNA−DNA hybridization with whole genome sequencing as a prerequisite for the description of Burkholderia species will undoubtedly speed up the pace at which their diversity are documented, especially in hyperdiverse regions such as the Cape Floristic Region.

P., WY, USA; JW/JH-Fiji- 2 : Savusavu, Vanu Levu, Fiji). All were Gram stain positive rods (∼ 0. 5 × 1. 8 μm). Cells occurred singly or in V-shaped pairs, and they formed long chains in complex media. All utilized H 2 to reduce amorphous iron (III) oxide/hydroxide to magnetite at temperatures from 50 to 75 °C (opt. ∼ 73 °C). Growth occurred within the pH 60 C range of 6. 5 - 8. 5 (opt. pH 60 C 7. 1 - 7. 3). Magnetite production by resting cells occurred at pH 60 C 5. 5 - 10. 3 (opt. 7. 3). The iron (III) reduction rate was 1. 3 μmol Fe(II) produced × h- 1 × ml- 1 {{in a culture}} with 3 × 107 cells, {{one of the highest}} rates reported. In {{the presence or absence of}} H 2, JW/KA- 2 T did not utilize CO. The G + C content of the genomic DNA of the type strain is 52. 7 ± 0. 3 mol%. Strains JW/KA- 1 and JW/KA- 2 T each contain two different 16 S rRNA gene sequences. The 16 S rRNA gene sequences from JW/KA- 1, JW/KA- 2 T, or JW/JH-Fiji- 2 possessed > 99 % similarity to each other but also 99 % similarity to the 16 S rRNA gene sequence from the anaerobic, thermophilic, hydrogenogenic CO-oxidizing bacterium 'Carboxydothermus restrictus' R 1. DNA-DNA hybridization between strain JW/KA- 2 T and strain R 1 T yielded 35 % similarity. Physiological characteristics and the 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the strains represent two novel species and are placed into the novel genus Thermolithobacter within the phylum 'Firmicutes'. In addition, the levels of 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity between the lineage containing the Thermolithobacter and well-established members of the three existing classes of the 'Firmicutes' is less than 85 %. Therefore, Thermolithobacter is proposed to constitute the first genus within a novel class of the 'Firmicutes', Thermolithobacteria.
