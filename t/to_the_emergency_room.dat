5|$|At around 10:50p.m. (EST) on 8 December 1980, lone gunman Mark David Chapman shot Lennon in {{the back}} {{four times in the}} archway of the Dakota as Lennon and Ono {{returned}} to their Manhattan apartment from the Record Plant. Lennon was rushed in a police cruiser <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> of nearby Roosevelt Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival at 11:00p.m. (EST). Earlier that evening, Lennon had autographed a copy of Double Fantasy for Chapman.|$|E
5|$|Early in July, Gilmore {{was rushed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> after {{suffering}} from vision problems. He was immediately hospitalized and compelled to undergo surgery {{after he was}} diagnosed with a detached retina. Gilmore's campaign was stalled as the candidate was ordered by doctors to restrict travel for an indefinite period. The doctors revealed that Gilmore's vision problems could have deteriorated to the loss of eyesight.|$|E
5|$|A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a {{delivery}} van. He was first {{placed in the}} driver's cab, but complained the van's movement was causing him pain. He {{was placed in the}} back of the van, on his stomach, and taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> at Bulovka Hospital. He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one of his lungs. He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A splenectomy was performed. The chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed.|$|E

5|$|Nelson {{has been}} arrested several times for {{marijuana}} possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in Dallas, Texas. In 1977 after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to The Bahamas. Nelson and Cochran arrived late {{to the airport and}} boarded the flight without luggage. The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell. Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room.</b> He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.|$|E
5|$|After {{the team}} split, Nitro, {{alongside}} Melina, was quickly placed into the Intercontinental Championship picture, winning the title twice. In November, after serving his suspension {{and a brief}} stint back in OVW, Mercury returned to WWE, reuniting MNM to answer an open challenge put out by The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) for the December to Dismember pay-per-view. At the event, MNM lost to the Hardys. MNM and the Hardys met again at Armageddon {{as part of a}} four-way ladder match, which also included the teams of Dave Taylor and William Regal and Paul London and Brian Kendrick. During the match, which saw London and Kendrick retain the WWE Tag Team Championship, Mercury was legitimately injured when he was struck in the face with a ladder, necessitating a trip <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> where his broken nose received 15 stitches. The facial injury was worked into the angle, and when Mercury returned wearing a protective covering on his face, the rivalry between the teams intensified with MNM actively seeking to injure {{one or both of the}} Hardys, even going so far as to attack and perform a Snapshot on Matt on exposed concrete following a match. MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble, and again at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February, which concluded the feud.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, the health {{benefits}} associated with increased physical activity have been established. 1 However, with increased participation in physical activity comes a subsequent increase in sports and exercise related injury.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how sociodemographic factors (income, education, employment status, age, gender, insurance coverage, {{and place of}} residence) are related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> use of hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> for serious personal problems in a nationally representative sample of adult black Americans. Bivariate analyses indicated that low income, unemployed, and older respondents were most likely <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room.</b> Gender, education, insurance coverage, and place of residence were not related to <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> use. Multivariate analyses revealed that the relationship of age to utilization {{could be explained by}} the high prevalence of physical health complaints among the old. The poor and unemployed remained significantly more likely (than the non-poor and those with jobs) <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> when all other predictors were taken into account. The implications of these findings for health services delivery <b>to</b> <b>the</b> urban black poor and the general illness behavior of black Americans are discussed...|$|R

Overlook began a brain tumor center in 1999. It had 538 beds in 2003.
