5|$|I-94/I-69 <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east {{about a mile}} (1.6km) {{north of}} their {{confluence}} to span the Black River north of downtown. On the eastern bank of the river, there is one final interchange for M-25 and BL I-69/BL I-94 before the freeway reaches the toll and customs plazas for the twin-span Blue Water Bridge. Past these plazas, I-94/I-69 ascends the approach to the bridge which crosses the St. Clair River to Point Edward (Sarnia), Ontario. At the international boundary {{at the center of}} the river, the Interstate designations jointly terminate, becoming Ontario Highway402.|$|E
5|$|South of the expressway, NY394 {{remains the}} primary lakeside roadway {{as it passes}} through the {{communities}} of Quigley Park and Cheney's Point. NY394 <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast at an intersection with CR43, passing Edward F. Loomis Park and remaining on the now-southern edge of Chautauqua Lake. As the route approaches Lakewood, traffic generally becomes more dense and it intersects NY474, a largely rural roadway linking the Jamestown area to Wattsburg, Pennsylvania.

5|$|Not {{far from}} Beaverkill Road is {{the east end}} of the {{spillway}} road, which was closed as a security precaution following the September11, 2001 attacks, but reopened after construction of a new alignment of NY28A was completed in 2012. Past the spillway road, NY28A continues east, briefly crossing the Blue Line and leaving Catskill Park as it passes another spillway. At the spillway's southeastern tip is a junction with Stone Church Road, where the route <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and reenters the park. Now in the town of Hurley, NY28A continues to follow the irregular reservoir shoreline to the northeast, but on a slightly further inland alignment than before. The land here remains wooded, but more frequently broken by houses on the southern side.|$|E

5|$|At Emerson Park, {{a public}} park {{situated}} near {{the midpoint of the}} northern lakeshore, the highway <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north to access Melrose Park, a community built up just north of the lake around the Owasco Outlet. Here, NY38A meets NY437, a short connector highway linking NY38A to its parent, NY38. North of Melrose Park, the route becomes known as Owasco Street as it follows the Owasco Outlet into the city of Auburn. At the city line, ownership and maintenance of the route shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to Auburn. The route heads northeastward through the densely populated city to Walnut Street, where it splits into a one-way couplet along Fulton Street (northbound) and John and Owasco Streets (southbound).
