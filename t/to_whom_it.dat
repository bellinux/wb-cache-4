5|$|LGBT, or GLBT, is an initialism {{that stands}} for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. In use since the 1990s, {{the term is}} an {{adaptation}} of the initialism LGB, which was used to replace the term gay {{in reference to the}} LGBT community beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s. Activists believed that the term gay community did not accurately represent all those <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> referred.|$|E
5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.|$|E
5|$|Located in {{the bottom}} of a narrow valley, the Nine Stones circle has a {{diameter}} of 9.1 metres by 7.8 metres (29 feet 10 inches by 25 feet 11 inches). It consists of nine irregularly spaced sarsen megaliths, with a small opening on its northern side. Two of the stones on the north-western side of the monument are considerably larger than the other seven. This architectural feature has parallels with various stone circles in south-western Scotland, and was potentially a deliberate choice of the circle's builders, <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> may have had symbolic meaning.|$|E

5|$|Rossini {{composed}} the Petite messe solennelle in 1863, 34 {{years after his}} last opera, in Passy, where he spent the last decades of his life. Rossini and his wife entertained a circle of friends, holding samedi soirs for which he composed several pieces of chamber music, often vocal, which the composer called his péchés de vieillesse (sins of old age). The mass was possibly commissioned by Count Alexis Pillet-Will for his wife Louise <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> is dedicated, but the musicologist Nancy P. Fleming points out that Rossini may have had reasons of his own to compose it, and dedicated it in response to staging the first performance.|$|E
5|$|Six more temples were {{discovered}} in the city, including the temple called the Massif Rouge (<b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> was dedicated is unknown), and temples dedicated for Ninni-Zaza, Ishtarat, Ishtar, Ninhursag and Shamash. All the temples were located {{in the center of}} the city except for the Ishtar temple and the area between the Enceinte Sacrée and the Massif Rouge is considered the administrative center of the high priest.|$|E
5|$|The {{conjugation}} of the {{new field}} colours, especially the use of green, was not traditional in the Portuguese national flag's composition and represented a radical republican-inspired change that broke the bond with the former monarchical flag. Since a failed republican insurrection on 31 January 1891, red and green had been established as the colours of the Portuguese Republican Party and its associated movements, whose political prominence kept growing until it reached a culmination period following the Republican revolution of 5 October 1910. In the ensuing decades, these colours were popularly propagandized as representing {{the hope of the}} nation (green) and the blood (red) of those who died defending it, as a means to endow them with a more patriotic and dignified, therefore less political, sentiment. Although the flag flown from the Oporto city hall in the morning of 31 January 1891, symbol of the republican uprising was red and green. Totally red with a green circle in the center, to which were added the inscriptions referring to the republican center <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> belonged - the Centro Democrático Federal 15 de Novembro.|$|E

The piece was commissioned by Trans-Siberian Art Festival 2014, Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France and Berliner Symphoniker and performed by Vadim Repin <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>it’s</b> dedicated.|$|R

25|$|The {{spread of}} Christianity has been international, {{in some cases}} entirely {{displacing}} the religions and altering the customs encountered among those people <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> has come. This centuries-long process has been met with violent opposition at times, and likewise the spread of Christianity has in some cases been carried out with martial force. The relationship of Christianity to other faiths is encumbered to some extent by this history, with modern Christians, particularly in the West, expressing embarrassment over the violence in Christianity's past.|$|E
25|$|An {{injunction}} is {{a remedy}} having {{the effect of}} preventing the party <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> is addressed from executing certain ultra vires acts. An injunction that is positive in nature may also be granted to compel performance of a particular act. This remedy is not available in Singapore in relation to public law. The Government Proceedings Act prevents the court from imposing injunctions or ordering specific performance in any proceedings against the Government. However, in place of such relief, the court may make an order declaratory of the rights between parties.|$|E

The play was adapted for films in 1949 and 1987.|$|E
25|$|Ginsberg would {{experiment}} with this breath-length form in many later poems. The first draft contained what {{would later become}} Part I and Part III. It is noted for relating stories and experiences of Ginsberg's friends and contemporaries, its tumbling, hallucinatory style, and the frank address of sexuality, specifically homosexuality, which subsequently provoked an obscenity trial. Although Ginsberg referred to many {{of his friends and}} acquaintances (including Neal Cassady, Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, Peter Orlovsky, Lucien Carr, and Herbert Huncke), the primary emotional drive was his sympathy for Carl Solomon, <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> was dedicated; he met Solomon in a mental institution and became friends with him.|$|E

25|$|After the Russian October Revolution of 1917, another looting by Bolsheviks, the {{short-lived}} Ukrainian movements, and the Polish–Soviet War in 1920, western Volhynia {{was transferred to}} Poland {{under the terms of}} the Peace of Riga. In 1921 the Lavra found itself on a crisis state with little food and much physical damage caused by nearly a decade of unrest. The most worrying factor for the monks however, was the ecclesiastical link <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> should submit. Like most Russian Orthodox communities that found themselves outside the USSR, and thus outside any possible ecclesiastical control from the persecuted Russian Orthodox Church, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople agreed to take over Moscow's role and the Lavra became part of the Polish Orthodox Church in 1923.|$|E
25|$|The oldest written work in Japanese {{literature}} is Kojiki in 712, in which Ō no Yasumaro recorded Japanese mythology and history as recited by Hieda no Are, <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> was handed down by his ancestors. Many of the poetic pieces {{recorded by the}} Kojiki were perhaps transmitted {{from the time the}} Japanese had no writing. The Nihon Shoki, the oldest history of Japan which was finished eight years later than the Kojiki, also contains many poetic pieces. These were mostly not long and had no fixed forms. The first poem documented in both books was attributed to a kami (god), named Susanoo, the younger brother of Amaterasu. When he married Princess Kushinada in Izumo Province, the kami made an uta, or waka, a poem.|$|E
25|$|This {{consists}} of an India-rubber contrivance which the female easily adjusts in the vagina before copulation, and which spreads a thin tissue of rubber before {{the mouth of the}} womb so as to prevent the seminal aura from entering. … Conception cannot possibly take place when it is used. The full enjoyment of the conjugal embrace can be indulged in during coition. The husband would hardly be likely to know that it was being used, unless told by the wife. … It places conception entirely {{under the control of the}} wife, <b>to</b> <b>whom</b> <b>it</b> naturally belongs; for it is for her to say at what time and under what circumstances, she will become the mother, and the moral, religious, and physical instructress of offspring.|$|E
