500|$|In {{a review}} by USA Today, [...] "Hello Good Morning" [...] was picked out {{as one of}} the best three songs on the Last Train to Paris. Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars in his review for the song, stating that {{although}} Dirty Money promised a new sound the song sounded like [...] "Timba–pop, albeit one with a better-than-average hook." [...] He continued, [...] "in Diddy's final-minute rap, [...] a reminder of how he jump-started his journey towards a reported $300m fortune and a butler called Fonzworth Bentley." [...] Matt from Above said it was the Danja-produced beat and the T.I. feature that make the song good. Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said [...] "Diddy seems to have abandoned conventional rapping in favour of some Kanye–style automooing. He's quite good at it, too. Adds a certain nasal edge to proceedings. There's a middle bit, and it's like nothing else in the song... It sounds more like someone doing the [...] "I've lost my keys" [...] song, just before they leave the house in the morning. <b>The</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> is that it was left in there. I mean if minimal is your bag, surely that'd be the first bit to cut?" [...] He awarded in four out of five stars. Becky Bain of Idolator was also positive about the song, saying, [...] "Lyrically and stylistically, it’s a pretty standard club track—over various synth beats, the song covers the usual topics: hot girls dancing, crowds waiting to have fun, and spending time in a five star suite with some five star freaks getting high all week... But honestly, we’re just overjoyed this song isn’t just a thinly-veiled four-minute commercial for any one of Diddy’s various products." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I've {{noticed that}} too,' said Bat. 'But <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> is you mustn't give the public {{straight}} Dickens--not in My business. I wonder why that is.' ...|$|E
50|$|Perceptor {{was named}} <b>the</b> <b>oddest</b> <b>thing</b> that G1 Transformers {{transform}} into by Topless Robot.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is <b>the</b> <b>oddest</b> <b>thing</b> I {{ever knew}} in my life. I {{should have said}} he was the last man in the world for success of that kind." ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{the aged}} gentleman again, {{but she did}} not wince; he soon found out that they expect authors to say <b>the</b> <b>oddest</b> <b>things,</b> and this proved to be a great help to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Almost dangerously so," [...] said Jane Mohun; [...] "and <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> is {{that they}} are just alike enough for first cousins, as they are here, though Shakespeare was not guilty of making them such." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} not, Mrs. Ray; and I didn't {{expect to see}} you. But <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> is I've come here about the same {{business}} as you, though I didn't {{know anything about it}} till yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't help it--you are. Oh, not disagreeably so, quite normally--that's <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> about you. Sometimes I {{believe that}} you were made for {{something}} different, {{that in spite of}} your success you have missed your 'metier.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I knew that. I {{was only}} talking. It's <b>the</b> <b>oddest</b> <b>thing</b> in Australia. Another thing: I've {{got to get}} up in the dark, in the morning, to take the 5 o'clock train. Now if the boots----" ...|$|R
50|$|Kei and Chinatsu's mother. She is {{familiar}} with the world of witchcraft and doesn't find some of <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>things</b> that happen because of Makoto strange at all. She illustrates and writes children books professionally as her job.|$|R
50|$|Mindwipe {{was named}} <b>the</b> 8th <b>oddest</b> <b>thing</b> that G1 Transformers {{transform}} into by Topless Robot.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> {{is that he}} was absurdly {{grateful}} to me for letting myself be saved. He seemed to think I had done him an intentional service, and fallen into the Atlantic {{for the sole purpose of}} letting him pull me out.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything seems steady now," [...] remarked Bastin, [...] "so I suppose this {{luggage lift}} has stopped. <b>The</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> is that I can't see {{anything}} of it. There {{ought to be}} a shaft, but we seem to be standing on a level floor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The air in {{this place}} must be charged with some form of electricity, but <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> {{is that it does}} not seem to harm us," [...] said Bickley in a matter-of-fact fashion as though he were {{determined}} not to be astonished.|$|E
50|$|Chainclaw (bear) Chainclaw {{was named}} <b>the</b> 7th <b>oddest</b> <b>thing</b> that G1 Transformers {{transform}} into by Topless Robot.|$|R
50|$|Please Teacher! (lead=yes), is a Japanese anime series, {{directed}} by Yasunori Ide and written by Yōsuke Kuroda, and produced by Bandai Visual, which was adapted into a manga and light novel, centering {{on a group}} of friends and <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>things</b> that happen to them after they get a new teacher.|$|R
60|$|But <b>the</b> <b>oddest</b> <b>thing</b> about Teeny Weeny was his long, pointed head {{ending in}} a long nose. No Mouse has a head like it. The edges of the ears could be seen above the fur, but the eyes were so tiny that Peter Rabbit thought he hadn't any and said so.|$|R
60|$|A {{moment later}} {{and we were}} {{whirling}} up as we had whirled down. I suppose that Yva came with us though I never saw her do so, and <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> was that when we arrived in the sepulchre, she seemed already to be standing there waiting to direct us.|$|E
6000|$|I.--I grant that; a {{man must}} be very maladroit not to be rich, if [...] he sticks at nothing {{in order to become}} rich. But <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> is [...] that there are people like me who do not look on riches as the most [...] {{precious}} thing in the world; bizarre people, you know.|$|E
60|$|I took it, thanked him, {{and left}} the room intrigued. And when I rejoined them, and handed her the manuscript, <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> was that the subject of their {{discourse}} having meanwhile shifted, it no longer interested her, and she never once opened the pages she had been in such haste to have me procure.|$|E
5000|$|The New York Daily News called Vezzetti [...] "The Wackiest Mayor in America" [...] {{because of}} <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>things</b> he did, like {{reporting}} a car stolen {{that ended up}} exactly where he had last parked it two months earlier. Vezetti was known for eccentric behavior such as wearing mismatched shoes, and carrying all his belongings in two paper bags.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{now that}} you have {{disposed}} of that you will sup with us," [...] said Lady Horton, who was convinced that since Ruth had gone to the altar with him he was Ruth's lover in spite of <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>things</b> she had heard. Appearances with Lady Horton counted for everything, and all that glittered was gold to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that is <b>the</b> <b>oddest</b> <b>thing</b> I ever heard. I {{know just}} such an old lady, and when I go home I'll try your plan. It {{seems to me that}} you have a great many queer old ladies on this island," [...] I said to another man, whom they called Peter, and who stood eating pumpkin all the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr Frank Harrogate, I think," [...] he said. [...] "I {{have had}} an introduction, but I {{do not mean to}} presume on it. <b>The</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> I have to say will come far better from a stranger. Mr Harrogate, I say one word and go: take care of your sister in her great sorrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's too {{kind of you}} to let me off that! And then I'm a {{tremendous}} fellow for reasons; that's my strong point, don't you know? I've a lot more besides those I've mentioned, done up and ready for delivery. <b>The</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> is that they don't always govern my behaviour. I rather think I do want to stand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{just the}} question. What have {{you to do}} with him? He {{suggests}} {{that there have been}} words between you as to Florence, which has caused Mountjoy to vanish. I don't profess to explain anything beyond that,--nor, indeed, do I profess to agree with my father. But <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> is that Prodgers, the policeman, has the same thing running in his head." ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} so piquant and original in these elucidations of humanity, that Mr. Shelby {{could not help}} laughing in company. Perhaps you laugh too, dear reader; but you know humanity comes out {{in a variety of}} strange forms now-a-days, and there is no end to <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>things</b> that humane people will say and do.|$|R
50|$|What {{remained}} over, {{untouched by}} the malady, unoppressed by his consciousness thereof, displayed a sweet and gravely-toned humanity. <b>The</b> <b>oddest</b> <b>thing</b> about his life in prison {{is that he was}} always trying to place his two nephews, the sons of his sister Cornelia, in court-service. One of them he attached to Guglielmo I, Duke of Mantua, the other to Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Roto-Rooter {{introduced}} {{a book titled}} Chilling Tales From The Porcelain Seat that featured [...] "true tales of the strange & unexplained things that happen and the Roto-Rooter Heroes that can fix them." [...] Roto-Rooter asked its plumbers throughout North America to submit true stories about <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>things</b> they have encountered on the job such as strange items recovered from toilets and sewer pipes.|$|R
6000|$|Everybody knew Jeff {{and liked}} him, but <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> was that till he made money nobody took any stock in his ideas at all. It {{was only after}} he made the [...] "clean up" [...] that they came {{to see what a}} splendid fellow he was. [...] "Level-headed" [...] I think was the term; indeed in the speech of Mariposa, the highest form of {{endowment}} was to have the head set on horizontally as with a theodolite.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not constantly--not {{when any}} one was with me,' said Leonard, roused by Dr. May's evident dismay; and drawn on by his face of anxious inquiry. 'At Milbank, I {{generally}} thought I remembered {{it just as}} they described it in court, {{and that it was}} some miserable ruinous delusion that hindered my confessing; but <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> was, that the moment any one opened my door, I forgot all about it, resolutions and all, and was myself again.' ...|$|E
60|$|As {{time went}} on, Oro began {{to visit me}} more and more frequently, till at last {{scarcely}} a night went by {{that he did not}} appear mysteriously in my sleeping-place. <b>The</b> <b>odd</b> <b>thing</b> was that neither Bickley nor Bastin seemed to be aware of these nocturnal calls. Indeed, when I mentioned them on one or two occasions, they stared at me and said it was strange that he should have come and gone as they saw nothing of him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] put in Bessie, [...] "the savage brute {{would follow}} her about like a dog. It was just <b>the</b> <b>oddest</b> <b>thing</b> I ever saw. But come on; {{we must be}} getting home, it's growing dark. Mouti"--which, being interpreted, means Medicine--she added, {{addressing}} the Kafir in Zulu--"help Captain Niel on to his horse. Be careful that the saddle does not twist round; the girths may be loose." ...|$|R
60|$|The sun {{was getting}} very low and red over the sea. She swam slowly in. On the beach Mrs. Topes waited, disapprovingly. She had known somebody, a strong man, who had caught cramp from staying in too long. He sank like a stone. Like a stone. The queer people Mrs. Topes had known! And the funny <b>things</b> they did, <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>things</b> that {{happened}} to them.|$|R
6000|$|Wildeve {{stood looking}} {{on the ground}} beside Venn's feet, till he allowed his eyes to travel upwards over Diggory's form, as {{illuminated}} by the candle, to his head and face. [...] "Ha-ha! Well, I suppose I deserve it, considering how I have played with them both," [...] he said at last, as much to himself as to Venn. [...] "But of all <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> <b>things</b> that ever I knew, <b>the</b> <b>oddest</b> is that you should so run counter to your own interests as to bring this to me." ...|$|R
