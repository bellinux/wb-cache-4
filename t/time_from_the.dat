5|$|As of May 12, 2017, {{there have}} been 200 spacewalks devoted to {{assembly}} and maintenance of the International Space Station totaling 1247 hours and 55 minutes. As of March 2, 2011, a total time of 973 hours and fifty-three minutes has been spent in extra-vehicular activity (EVA), with 127 of these EVAs performed from station airlocks, totaling 787 hours and twenty-eight minutes in spacewalk <b>time</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> station itself. Twenty-eight spacewalks have been performed from a shuttle, ninety-three from the Quest Joint Airlock, thirty-two from the Pirs docking compartment, and two from the transfer compartment at the forward end of the Zvezda Service Module.|$|E

5|$|Boletus auripes has a disjunct distribution, {{and is one}} {{of several}} fungi found in both eastern Asia and eastern North America. In North America, where it is {{relatively}} common, the range of the fungus extends from Alaska south to Mexico, and east to New York. In Central America, it has been recorded in Belize. The mushroom has also been recorded from Taiwan, China (including Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangdong, Kwangsi, and Hunan), and Japan. It was reported for the first <b>time</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Russian Far East in 2008.|$|E
5|$|By early 1997, {{after almost}} two decades of activity, the only repairs {{completed}} were phase one of the air ventilation system to dehumidify the hollow base, the drainage pipes and a new inner roof. Plans now included the erection of a temporary two-story metal building to protect all but the giant Father <b>Time</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> harsh winters and to facilitate year-round repair; the reinforcement of corroded steel interior portions; the replacement of inconsistent patches; the substitution of engineered spacing for natural cracks, and finally, hand-brushed concrete recoating. The temporary building was budgeted at $270,000; the city spent a total of $450,000 on repairs approved by the Park District that year.|$|E
5|$|Chesney left {{at least}} ten books to Lincoln Cathedral, of which seven survive. Five of the seven show a {{uniformity}} of handwriting, leading to speculation {{that there may have}} been a scriptorium at Lincoln Cathedral during Chesney's tenure, but other surviving books that were in the cathedral library at the same time do not share any handwriting or other characteristics; Chesney may simply have commissioned the books at the same <b>time</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> same scribes.|$|E

5|$|Greene's {{attack is}} the {{earliest}} surviving mention of Shakespeare's {{work in the}} theatre. Biographers suggest that his career may have begun any <b>time</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mid-1580s to just before Greene's remarks. After 1594, Shakespeare's plays were performed only by the Lord Chamberlain's Men, a company owned {{by a group of}} players, including Shakespeare, that soon became the leading playing company in London. After the death of Queen Elizabeth in 1603, the company was awarded a royal patent by the new King James I, and changed its name to the King's Men.|$|E

In two articles published in Tilloch's Philosophical Journal in January and February 1814, Accum described the iodine content of different kinds of seaweed and gave a detailed account of a process for iodine production.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} part, Nico Rosberg was fastest, {{half a second}} faster than {{teammate}} Hamilton, and 1.7 seconds clear of the pole position lap <b>time</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> year before. Both McLarens had shown promising pace, but nevertheless dropped out of contention in 12th and 14th, while Daniil Kvyat was the last driver to secure a place in Q3, demoting Carlos Sainz Jr. to 11th. Kvyat's Red Bull teammate Daniel Ricciardo also progressed, albeit suffering a failure of his wing mirror, which hung {{off the side of}} his vehicle during his last timed lap. Eliminated at the back were both Haas drivers, along Nico Hülkenberg, who was unable to follow his teammate Pérez into Q3 and qualified 13th.|$|E

But as the Dorniers neared the airfield they noticed {{that there was no}} smoke, or signs of damage. They expected to be polishing off a damaged fighter station. As the Germans burst over the airfield the air was suddenly filled with tracer rounds as the Dorniers' gunners engaged the Bofors and British AAA defences.|$|E
5|$|Losing {{power and}} speed, Roma {{began to fall}} out of the battle group. Around 16:02, another Fritz X slammed into the {{starboard}} side of Romas deck, between frames 123 and 136. It most likely detonated in the forward engine room, sparking flames, and causing heavy flooding in the magazines of main battery turret number two and the fore port side secondary battery turret, and putting even more pressure upon the previously stressed hull girder. Seconds after the initial blast, the number two 15-inch turret was blown over the side by a massive explosion, this <b>time</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> detonation of that turret's magazines.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Creek {{fire started}} on June 14 well {{north of the}} park in the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, and for almost two months seemed to pose little threat to Yellowstone. Then, on August 20, the fire moved rapidly to the south also {{threatening}} the town of Cooke City, this <b>time</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north. An effort to bulldoze a wide fire break and set backfires to try to starve the fires of combustibles almost led to disaster when an unexpected change in wind direction brought the fires to within a hundred yards of parts of the town, forcing evacuations on September 6.|$|E

5|$|The {{aviation}} industry {{had been studying}} this problem for some <b>time.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> mid-1940s, there was much interest in using nuclear-powered aircraft in the bomber role. In a conventional jet engine, thrust is provided by heating air using jet fuel and accelerating it out a nozzle. In a nuclear engine, heat is supplied by a reactor, whose consumables last for months instead of hours. Most designs also carried {{a small amount of}} jet fuel for use during high-power portions of flight—take-off and high-speed dashes.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} organization into județe of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia (where {{they were}} termed ținuturi) {{dates back to}} at least the late 14th century. For {{most of the time}} since modern Romania was formed in 1859, the administrative division system has been similar to the French departments one. The system has been changed several times since then, and the number of counties has varied over <b>time,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 71 județe that existed before World War II to only 39 after 1968. The current format has largely been in place since 1968 as only small changes have been made since then, the last of which was in 1997.|$|E
