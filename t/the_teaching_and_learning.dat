Students focus on rote-memorization (written and oral repetition) as the main learning strategy. These methods, which fit very well with the Chinese way of learning, have been criticized as fundamentally flawed by Western educationalists and linguists.|$|E

Some top instructors who work with professional golfers have become quite well known in their own right. Professional golf instructors can use physical conditioning, mental visualization, classroom sessions, club fitting, driving range instruction, on-course play under real conditions, and review of videotaped swings in slow motion to teach golf to prepare the golfer for the course.|$|E

2500|$|Racially {{segregated}} minority neighborhoods {{have been}} associated with having low academic achievement rates. Rumberger and Willms have explored the topic and argue that segregation attributes to minorities under achievement in at least two ways. Firstly, students in segregated schools may receive a poor quality of education because schools serving minorities or low socioeconomic groups may have lower funding levels, inexperienced teachers, and reduced levels of other resources that contribute to the student's academic achievement. Secondly, Rumsberg and Willms argue that the residential racial segregation leads to schools having the same composition which can directly affect the student's level of academic achievement. They call these differences [...] "contextual effects". Contextual effects are defined as peer interactions and <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> climate in the school.|$|E

Two research questions were formulated. They are (1) what the types and media’s roles used in <b>the</b> English <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> of Class X of SMA 2 Kebumen are? (2) What the characteristics of students’ responses of SMA 2 Kebumen to English <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> process by using multimedia are like? This research was conducted by using a descriptive method. The participants of the research were the first grade students of SMA N 2 Kebumen. The source of the data were students’ responses, activities, or behaviors during <b>the</b> English <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> process. <b>The</b> key instrument of the research was the researcher himself.

Based on the analysis of students’ responses toward <b>the</b> English <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> using multimedia, it was figured out that the responses consisted of verbal responses and nonverbal responses. Those verbal responses were asking to the teacher, answering the question, chatting, practicing, and singing.

2500|$|The {{desire for}} a single {{international}} system of measurement came from growing international trade {{and the need to}} apply common standards to goods. For a company to buy a product produced in another country, they need to ensure that the product would arrive as described. The medieval ell was abandoned in part because its value could not be standardised. One primary advantage of the International System of Units is simply that it is international, and the pressure on countries to conform to it grew as it became increasingly an international standard. However, it also simplified <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> <b>learning</b> of measurement as all SI units are based on a handful of base units (in particular, the metre, kilogram and second cover the majority of everyday measurements), using decimal prefixes to cover all magnitudes. This contrasts with pre-metric units, which largely have names that do not relate directly to one another (e.g. inch, foot, yard, mile) and are related to one another by inconsistent ratios which must simply be memorised (e.g. 12, 3, 1760). As the values in an SI expression are always decimal (i.e. without vulgar fractions) and mixed units (such as [...] "feet and inches") are not used with SI, measurements are easy to add or multiply. Moreover, scientific measurement and calculation are greatly simplified as the units for electricity, force etc. are part of the SI system and hence are all interrelated in a coherent manner (e.g. 1J = 1kg·m2·s−2 = 1V·A·s). Standardization of measures has contributed significantly to the industrial revolution and technological development in general. SI is not the only example of international standardization; several powerful international standardization organizations exist for various industries, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).|$|E
