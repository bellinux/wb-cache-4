5|$|News of {{the rescue}} was {{released}} to the public on February 2. The feat was celebrated by MacArthur's soldiers, Allied correspondents, and the American public, as <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> had touched an emotional chord among Americans concerned about the fate of the defenders of Bataan and Corregidor. Family members of the POWs were contacted by telegram to inform them {{of the rescue}}. News of <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> was broadcast on numerous radio outlets and newspaper front pages. The Rangers and POWs were interviewed to describe the conditions of the camp, as well as the events of <b>the</b> <b>raid.</b> The enthusiasm over <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> was later overshadowed by other Pacific events, including the Battle for Iwo Jima and the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. <b>The</b> <b>raid</b> was soon followed by additional successful raids, such as <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> of Santo Tomas Civilian Internment Camp on February3, <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> of Bilibid Prison on February4, and <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> at Los Baños on February23.|$|E
5|$|An Australian POW {{that was}} freed in <b>the</b> <b>raid,</b> Private Walter Gossner of the 2/15th Battalion, {{provided}} an extremely {{detailed account of}} his experiences about {{being part of a}} group of 87 POWs freed by Partisans from a location near Ožbalt. He gives the date of <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> as 27 September 1944, four weeks after the date given by Churches. His account has been posted on the internet by his family. Gossner states that he arrived at Semič 21 days after <b>the</b> <b>raid,</b> and his account varies significantly from that of Churches. It is not known why Gossner's dates and other details of his account differ so markedly from Churches' account.|$|E
5|$|Approval for the mission, codenamed Operation Chariot, {{was given}} on 3 March 1942. Using a French ship would involve using the Free French forces and {{increase}} the number of people aware of <b>the</b> <b>raid.</b> Consequently, it was decided the navy would have to provide a ship of their own. The RAF complained that <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> would draw heavily on their resources; the number of aircraft assigned by RAF Bomber Command was reduced time and time again before the day of <b>the</b> <b>raid.</b> British Prime Minister Winston Churchill further complicated matters when he ordered that bombing should only take place if targets were clearly identified.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>raiding</b> {{forces were}} mostly {{provided}} by the British Commandos, but <b>the</b> two largest <b>raids,</b> Operation Gauntlet and Operation Jubilee, drew heavily on Canadian troops. The size of <b>the</b> <b>raiding</b> force depended on the objective. <b>The</b> smallest <b>raid</b> was two men from No. 6 Commando in Operation J V. <b>The</b> largest <b>raid</b> involved over 10,500 men in Operation Jubilee. Most of <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> were scheduled to only last overnight, but some, like Operation Gauntlet, were conducted {{over a number of}} days.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Raiding</b> Squadrons are {{commanded}} by Majors and consist of 108 men. <b>The</b> <b>Raiding</b> Squadrons each field three Raiding Troops with two Raiding Sections of 16 men each per troop.|$|R

5|$|CNN cited {{a senior}} U.S. {{official}} as saying {{three sets of}} photographs of bin Laden's body exist: Photos taken at an aircraft hangar in Afghanistan, described as the most recognizable and gruesome; photos taken from the burial at sea on the USS Carl Vinson before a shroud was placed around his body; and photos from <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> itself, which include shots of {{the interior of the}} compound as well as three of the others who died in <b>the</b> <b>raid.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite its failure, <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> was {{presented}} in Britain as a courageous and daring gamble that {{came very close to}} success. Three Victoria Crosses and numerous other gallantry medals were awarded to sailors who participated in the operation. British forces had moderate casualties in <b>the</b> <b>raid,</b> compared to minimal German losses.|$|E
50|$|Gibson {{was able}} to reclaim some wood stock which was confiscated during <b>the</b> <b>raids,</b> and {{produced}} {{a new series of}} guitar marketed to draw attention to <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> and seizures. This is discussed in the Instruments section below.|$|R
50|$|The {{government}} of Buenos Aires tries {{to eradicate the}} manteros with police raids, removing them from the sidewalks and seizing their products. The police also made 35 successful search and seizures at illegal warehouses in January 2014. The manteros, however, return days after <b>the</b> <b>raids.</b> Still, <b>the</b> government attempts to weaken the organizations that back the manteros with <b>the</b> constant <b>raids.</b> <b>The</b> manteros reacted to <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> with demonstrations.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of <b>the</b> <b>raids,</b> <b>the</b> ASIO was {{investigated}} {{by a series of}} Royal Commissions.|$|R
5|$|Seven {{years later}} the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba says: plundered the English {{as far as the}} river Tees, and he seized a {{multitude}} of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made <b>the</b> <b>raid,</b> but Constantine incited him, as I have said. Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.|$|E
5|$|The Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War {{states that}} <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> {{occurred}} at St Lorenzen (the German name of Lovrenc na Pohorju), and that <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> was planned by two British officers. This varies significantly {{from all of}} the other sources, and it is unknown why this is the case.|$|E
5|$|The man {{selected}} {{to lead the}} Commando force was Lieutenant Colonel Charles Newman; his No. 2 Commando would provide the largest Commandos contingent, 173 men, for <b>the</b> <b>raid.</b> The Special Service Brigade headquarters used <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> to provide experience for their other units and 92 men were drawn from Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 12 Commandos.|$|E
50|$|On {{the next}} day, {{the armed forces}} and <b>the</b> police <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> Rwenzururu royal palace after the {{expiration}} of an ultimatum issued by the Ugandan government, resulting in the deaths of 87 royal guards and 16 policemen.

5|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> was to destroy three objectives: the Normandie dock, the old gates into the Bassin de St Nazaire {{together}} with the water pumping machinery and other installations, and any U-boats or other shipping in the area. The initial Combined Operations plan required one specially lightened destroyer to carry out <b>the</b> <b>raid.</b> It would be packed with explosives and rammed into the dock gates.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>raid</b> lasted {{seventeen}} {{minutes and}} involved 30–35 soldiers. The terrorists killed one hostage and seriously wounded two others during <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> while the SAS killed {{all but one}} of the terrorists. The rescued hostages and the remaining terrorist, who was still concealed amongst them, were taken into the embassy's back garden and restrained on the ground while they were identified. The last terrorist was identified by Sim Harris and led away by the SAS.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler {{was furious}} that the British {{had been able}} to sail a {{flotilla}} of ships up the Loire unhindered. His immediate reaction was to dismiss Generaloberst Carl Hilpert, chief-of-staff to the Commander in Chief West. <b>The</b> <b>raid</b> refocused German attention on the Atlantic Wall, and special attention was given to ports to prevent any repeat of <b>the</b> <b>raid.</b> By June 1942, the Germans began using concrete to fortify gun emplacements and bunkers in quantities previously only used in U-boat pens. Hitler laid out new plans in a meeting with Armaments Minister Albert Speer in August 1942, calling for the construction of 15,000 bunkers by May 1943 to defend the Atlantic coast from Norway to Spain.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Caravan <b>raids</b> were {{a series}} of raids in which Muhammed and his companions participated. <b>The</b> <b>raids</b> were {{generally}} offensive and carried out to gather intelligence or seize the trade goods of caravans financed by <b>the</b> Quraysh. <b>The</b> <b>raids</b> were intended to weaken the economy of Mecca by Muhammad. His followers were also impoverished. Muhammad broke an Arab tradition of not attacking one's own kinsmen by raiding caravans.|$|R

His followers were also impoverished.

50|$|There {{were three}} {{separate}} air raids made on this viaduct from England, between September 1943 and February 1944, involving {{a total of}} thirty-one Lancaster bombers operating some seven hundred miles from base. Aircraft of <b>the</b> second <b>raid</b> flew on to Rabat, and from <b>the</b> third <b>raid</b> on to Sardinia. One Lancaster from <b>the</b> first <b>raid</b> was lost, and a flight lieutenant bomb aimer on <b>the</b> third <b>raid</b> was killed by enemy fire, some of which came from ships at sea. All <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> failed in their objective and the rail link was not severed.|$|R
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> March-Phillipps {{was awarded}} the Distinguished Service Order, Hayes {{was awarded the}} Military Cross, and Appleyard a Bar to his Military Cross; Lippett and Guise were each {{appointed}} Member of the Order of the British Empire. Another commando, and the only professional sailor on <b>the</b> <b>raid,</b> Private Anders Lassen, was {{the first man to}} board Duchessa d'Aosta. For conspicuous efficiency in getting the ship under way, Lassen was given a commission in the field, and the immediate award of the Military Cross.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>raid,</b> 228 men of {{the force}} of 611 {{returned}} to Britain; 169 were killed and 215 became prisoners of war. German casualties were over 360 dead, some killed after <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> when Campbeltown exploded. To recognise their bravery, 89 decorations were awarded {{to members of the}} raiding party, including five Victoria Crosses. After the war, St Nazaire was one of 38 battle honours awarded to the Commandos; the operation has since become known as The Greatest Raid of All within military circles.|$|E

5000|$|Vangheluwe's {{resignation}} {{came at a}} time {{of increased}} media coverage of clerical sex abuse in Europe. After the resignation, the Catholic Church launched an investigating commission into allegations of clerical child abuse in Belgium, headed by the independent psychologist Peter Adriaenssens. The commission's work came to an abrupt end on 24 June 2010, when <b>the</b> Belgian police <b>raided</b> <b>the</b> offices of the Catholic Church in Belgium and sealed them. There were four raids in all, with thousands of documents seized. One of <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> involved drilling into the tombs of two cardinals. The Vatican was reported as being 'indignant' over <b>the</b> <b>raids,</b> saying they had led to the [...] "violation of confidentiality of precisely those victims for whom <b>the</b> <b>raids</b> were carried out".|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>raid</b> one {{civilian}} and three American soldiers had been killed and eight wounded including the Ojo de Agua post's commanding officer, Sergeant Schaffer, who was included among the former. The Seditionistas also took several casualties, with five men dead and at least nine others wounded, of whom two later died. A Japanese man was found among the dead, as were two Carranzista soldiers, a fact which was seen {{as evidence that the}} Carranzistas had been supporting the Plan of San Diego. The American soldiers were commended for their bravery during <b>the</b> <b>raid,</b> and Sergeant First Class Herbert Reeves Smith was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross for his actions during the engagement.|$|E
