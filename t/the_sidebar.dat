25|$|Truncation {{errors are}} {{committed}} when an iterative method is terminated or a mathematical procedure is approximated, and the approximate solution {{differs from the}} exact solution. Similarly, discretization induces a discretization error because {{the solution of the}} discrete problem does not coincide with the solution of the continuous problem. For instance, in the iteration in <b>the</b> <b>sidebar</b> to compute the solution of , after 10 or so iterations, we conclude that the root is roughly 1.99 (for example). We therefore have a truncation error of 0.01.|$|E

25|$|Similar to Improv, {{formulas}} can {{be represented}} as icons in Numbers, allowing them to be dragged about the sheets. One noteworthy {{example of this is}} a sidebar which contains the sum, average and other basic calculations for the current selection in the active table. These serve a function similar to the sum that appears {{at the bottom of the}} window in Excel. However, the user can drag one of the function icons from <b>the</b> <b>sidebar</b> into the sheet to make the calculation appear in that location. In another nod to Improv, the Formula List shows all of the formulas in the spreadsheet in a separate area, and allows edits in place or easy navigation to their use in the sheets.|$|E

2500|$|April EDW (built on April 19, 2006 with a {{build number}} of 5365), which was {{released}} on April 21, 2006, introduced more changes to visual user interface elements, and to the behavior of User Account Control. A number of new backgrounds were also introduced, and two new screensavers were added as well. <b>The</b> <b>Sidebar</b> was enabled by default, as was automatic defragmentation of the hard drive. Hold'em, a game that shipped with some previous CTPs, was dropped due to apparent [...] "political sensitivity" [...] issues; Microsoft now offers it as a separate web download for Windows Vista Ultimate users.|$|E
2500|$|Build 4066 (build date of February 26, 2004). Although this build {{identified}} {{itself as}} a [...] "Server" [...] build, it contained many of the features only ever seen and associated with desktop builds. An updated version of Phodeo was included, as well as <b>the</b> <b>Sidebar,</b> a Mini-Windows Media Player and associated sidebar tiles, a functioning build of the Desktop Window Manager and the Jade theme. This build also replaced many XP icons with new Longhorn icons, some of which greatly resemble icons in {{the final version of}} Vista. This build was leaked on December 20, 2008.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used [...] "blog" [...] {{as both a}} noun and verb ("to blog", meaning [...] "to edit one's weblog or to post to one's weblog") and devised the term [...] "blogger" [...] in {{connection}} with Pyra Labs' Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.|$|E

2500|$|Build 4015 (build date of March 28, 2003) {{was leaked}} to the Internet on April 28, 2003. A number of {{features}} Microsoft {{had been working on}} were rolled into this build, such as a range of parental controls, also moved and enlarged the Windows logo to {{the left side of the}} Start button a lot of additional configurability for <b>the</b> <b>sidebar</b> (including being able to put it below the start bar at the bottom of the screen), and the notion of [...] "Libraries" [...] (later known as virtual folders) of files. These libraries collected content from around the hard drive. The user could then filter this content and save it in a folder. Microsoft had originally intended to replace all special shell folders (My Documents, My Music, etc.) with virtual folders. However, this change was deemed too drastic and was dropped after Beta 1's release in mid-2005. Libraries were later included in Windows 7. This build was also notable for the debut of the boot screen progress bar that is seen in the final release (though 4015's version was blue, not green). A new Download Manager shell location suggested that Internet Explorer would get a Mozilla-style download manager, though no such functionality was apparent. Significant memory leak problems with Windows Explorer and <b>the</b> <b>Sidebar</b> made this build difficult to use, which resulted in some third-party hacks to mitigate the problem. The back-end database of Outlook Express changed completely, and became dependent on WinFS to store its email. WinFS itself still had significant performance and memory usage issues, and so it became common for testers to disable WinFS entirely, thus rendering Outlook Express inoperative.|$|E
2500|$|Build 3683 (build date of September 23, 2002) {{was leaked}} on October 20, 2002, {{and was the}} first Longhorn build leaked to the Internet. This build was the first of several that had a working title of [...] "Longhorn XP Professional". Visually it was not {{significantly}} different from Windows XP. One of the notable changes was that the Windows logo was only white, not colored like all the versions of Windows before it. Also the templates in the My Documents and My Pictures were notably different as well as the Open and Save as dialog boxes also included the template, incorporating aesthetic changes and a few new user interface options. A new [...] "Sidebar" [...] was also present, which contained many of the gadgets that would much later be seen in Windows Sidebar, such as an analog clock, slide show, and search capability. An option in this version of <b>the</b> <b>sidebar</b> also made it possible to move the Start button into it, and disable the traditional taskbar entirely. An early revision of WinFS was also included, but very {{little in the way of}} a user interface was included, and as such it appeared to early testers to be nothing more than a service that consumed large amounts of memory and processor time. The [...] "Display Properties" [...] control panel was the first significant departure, being built on the new [...] "Avalon" [...] API.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{web pages}} require a layout with {{multiple}} (often three) columns, {{with the main}} page content in one column (often the center), and supplementary content such as menus and advertisements in <b>the</b> other columns (<b>sidebars).</b> These columns commonly require separate backgrounds, with borders between them, and should {{appear to be the}} same height no matter which column has the tallest content. A common requirement is that <b>the</b> <b>sidebars</b> have a fixed width, with the center column adjusting in size to fill the window (fluid or liquid layout). Another common requirement is that, when a page does not contain enough content to fill the screen, the footer should drop {{to the bottom of the}} browser window instead of leaving blank space underneath.|$|R
