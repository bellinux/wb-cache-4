500|$|Smithers {{was partly}} {{based on how}} {{numerous}} Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' orientation was pitched by Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw {{too much attention to}} it and should <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> {{in the back of their}} heads. [...] Jay Kogen said [...] "Originally he was gay and black...But we thought it was too much so we just kept him gay." [...] The script for [...] "Blood Feud" [...] originally featured Smithers saying [...] "Just leave me enough to get home to my wife and kids", but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers. The name Waylon was first used in [...] "I Married Marge" [...] and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E
2500|$|A key {{anchor for}} the area is the New York Stock Exchange. City {{authorities}} realize its importance, and believed that it has [...] "outgrown its neoclassical temple {{at the corner of}} Wall and Broad streets", and in 1998 offered substantial tax incentives to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> in the financial district. Plans to rebuild it were delayed by the events of 2001. In 2011 the exchange still occupies the same site. The exchange is the locus for an impressive amount of technology and data. For example, to accommodate the three thousand persons who work directly on the Exchange floor requires 3,500 kilowatts of electricity, along with 8,000 phone circuits on the trading floor alone, and 200 miles of fiber-optic cable below ground.|$|E
2500|$|A {{turning point}} in Zimmer's career {{occurred}} with the 1988 film Rain Man. Hollywood director Barry Levinson was {{looking for someone to}} score Rain Man, and his wife heard the soundtrack CD of the anti-apartheid drama A World Apart, for which Zimmer had composed the music. Levinson was impressed by Zimmer's work and hired him to score Rain Man. In the score, Zimmer uses synthesizers (mostly a Fairlight CMI) mixed with steel drums. Zimmer explained that [...] "It was a road movie, and road movies usually have jangly guitars or a bunch of strings. I kept thinking don't be bigger than the characters. <b>Try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> contained. The Raymond character doesn't actually know where he is. The world is so different to him. He might as well be on Mars. So, why don't we just invent our own world music for a world that doesn't really exist?". Zimmerâ€™s score for Rain Man was nominated for an Academy Award in 1989, and the film won four Academy Awards including Best Picture.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{believed}} that the first match to be played under floodlights took place on 11 August 1952, between Middlesex County Cricket Club and Arsenal Football Club. The match was a benefit for Jack Young, and {{was not the first}} benefit match held between the two sides. Floodlights at Arsenal's Highbury ground had been installed in the summer of 1951, and were first used for football in October 1951. The cricket match took place at 19:30, the lights were turned on {{towards the end of the}} first innings, in which Arsenal were batting. A public announcement was made, advising spectators (of which there were just over 7,000) to [...] "Keep your eye on the ball, when you see it coming keep low. The batsmen will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> down but they can't promise." [...] The match was televised on the BBC, with over a million viewers tuning in to watch the spectacle. The Times was not convinced of the success of floodlights in cricket, mischievously asking: [...] "What is to prevent non-stop Test matches where the last wicket falls as the milkman arrives?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Williams was {{the subject}} of a media and press furore in February 2008, {{following}} a lecture he gave to the Temple Foundation at the Royal Courts of Justice on the subject of [...] "Islam and English Law". He raised the question of conflicting loyalties which communities might have, cultural, religious and civic. He also argued that theology has a place in debates about the very nature of law [...] "however hard our culture may <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> out" [...] and noted that there is, in a [...] "dominant human rights philosophy", a reluctance to acknowledge the liberty of conscientious objection. He spoke of [...] "supplementary jurisdictions" [...] to that of the civil law. Noting the anxieties which the word sharia provoked in the West, he drew attention to the fact that there was a debate within Islam between what he called [...] "primitivists" [...] for whom, for instance, apostasy should still be punishable and those Muslims who argued that sharia was a developing system of Islamic jurisprudence and that such a view was no longer acceptable. He made comparisons with Orthodox Jewish practice (beth din) and with the recognition of the exercise of conscience of Christians.|$|E
2500|$|A typical {{passage of}} rugby union takes the {{following}} form. [...] Unlike rugby league and gridiron football, {{possession of the}} ball in rugby union is contestable at all times by both teams [...] there is no separate 'offense' and 'defense'. [...] The team which has possession of the ball {{at any given time}} will normally <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it,</b> while the other team will try to recapture it, or at least deny the team in possession the chance to attack and/or force it to kick the ball away or commit an error. [...] One team will initially gain possession of the ball, either from the kick-off, a restart kick or a set piece (scrum and line-out, see below). The need to maintain possession means the team with the ball will usually seek to progress towards the opposition by running forward while carrying the ball; although if there are few opportunities to attack they may choose to kick the ball forward, from the hand, usually giving it back to the opposition but in a position from where {{it will be difficult to}} attack. The ball may be thrown from one player to another (passing) but must not be thrown forward, that is towards the opposition dead-ball line. [...] Any teammate ahead of the ball-carrier is offside and must not interfere with play. [...] So American football style-blocking is forbidden, although tackling or obstructing a player who does not have the ball is against the laws anyway, whether or not the tackling player is offside. [...] The team not in possession attempts to stop the ball-carrier by grabbing and bringing them to ground (a tackle). [...] A tackled player, once having been brought to ground, must immediately pass or release the ball, allowing the two teams to contest possession of the loose ball; if the attacking player is tackled but the tackler releases the ball carrier the ball carrier may get up and continue the play. [...] Play does not stop unless there is an infringement of the Laws, the ball/ball-carrier leaves the field of play, the ball becomes unplayable after a tackle, or the attacking team scores points by either touching the ball over the goal-line (a try) or drop-kicking the ball over the crossbar. [...] If the ball or ball-carrier goes into touch (out of the field of play), the game restarts with a line-out. If the game stops due to an infringement, play restarts with either a scrum, free kick or penalty kick (depending on the nature of the infringement) to the non-infringing team.|$|E
