5|$|After the shootout in Tombstone, {{his pursuit}} {{and murder of}} those who {{attacked}} his brothers, and after leaving Arizona, Wyatt was often <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> negative newspaper stories that disparaged his and his brothers' reputation.

5|$|As one of {{the nearest}} Sun-like stars with a planet, Epsilon Eridani has been <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> several {{observations}} {{in the search for}} extraterrestrial intelligence.

5|$|As one of {{the nearest}} Sun-like stars, Epsilon Eridani has been <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> many {{attempts}} to search for planetary companions. Its chromospheric activity and variability mean that finding planets with the radial velocity method is difficult, because the stellar activity may create signals that mimic the presence of planets. Attempts at direct imaging of potential exoplanets have proven unsuccessful to date.|$|E
5|$|At 16:29, the Japanese dive bombers {{began their}} attacks. Although several {{attempted}} {{to set up}} to attack the Saratoga, they quickly shifted back to the nearer carrier, Enterprise. Thus, Enterprise was <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> almost the entire Japanese air attack. Several Wildcats followed the Vals into their attack dives, despite the intense anti-aircraft artillery fire from Enterprise and her screening warships, {{in a desperate attempt}} to disrupt their attacks. As many as four Wildcats were shot down by U.S. anti-aircraft fire, as well as several Vals.|$|E

Camptothecins and novel noncamptothecins {{in clinical}} development (indenoisoquinolines and ARC- 111) target eukaryotic type IB topoisomerases (Top 1), whereas human type IIA topoisomerases (Top 2 α and Top 2 β) are <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> widely used anticancer agents etoposide, anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin), and mitoxantrone. Bacterial type II topoisomerases (gyrase and Topo IV) are <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> quinolones and aminocoumarin antibiotics. This review {{focuses on the}} molecular and biochemical characteristics of topoisomerases and their inhibitors. We also discuss the common mechanism of action of topoisomerase poisons by interfacial inhibition and trapping of topoisomerase cleavage complexes...|$|R

5|$|Before {{the castle}} could be completed, however, the French attacked. Admiral Claude d'Annebault crossed the Channel and arrived off the Solent with 200 ships on 19 July, where the local {{authorities}} feared Sandown Castle might be <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>of</b> a night attack. 2,000 French soldiers men landed on the Isle of Wight and attacked Sandown, where labourers were still present. Their advance soon stalled, however, and the French retreated back to their fleet, bringing the invasion threat to an end; the castle was finally completed after their departure.|$|E

Nevertheless, the island was never conquered and despite occasional raids in the 8th century it remained securely in Byzantine hands; Crete was too far from the Arab naval bases in the Levant for an effective expedition against it to be undertaken.|$|E
