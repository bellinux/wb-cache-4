This saw a change in the individual unit establishments, with the addition of organic transport assets, as well as an increase in the allocation of indirect and direct fire support weapons at commando level.

Intermodal transport has received an increased attention due to problems of road congestion, environmental concerns and traffic safety. Strategic importance of speed, reliability and flexibility in the supply chain is forcing companies to re-examine traditional logistics services. As a result, interest in addressing the problem of intermodal <b>transport</b> and <b>logistics</b> is growing. In order to improve efficiency and sustainability of freight transport in Europe, the European Commission has launched a series of initiatives, projects and has defined the basic directions of development of intermodal <b>transport</b> and <b>logistics.</b> The paper presents the recommendations and measures for the further development of intermodal <b>transport</b> and <b>logistics</b> in Serbia...|$|R

Northeast Asian Region which covers 5. 7 % of the total world’s area and has around 25. 8 % of the total world’s population {{has been one of the}} most active regions of economic and social development in recent two decades largely due to the emergence of China and Russia in the world market. However, different from the EU which provides an excellent example of economic and transport integration, the <b>transport</b> and <b>logistics</b> system in Northeast Asia still has massive room for improvement. The concept of transportation corridor construction has been adopted in the research and the five most important international transportation corridors in Northeast Asia have been fully examined in terms of current situation and major problems and issues. The major issues include inadequate and imbalanced transportation infrastructure, lack of funding as well as insufficient institutional mechanisms. Consequently, the policy and action plans in four sectors are formulated to improve the performance of the <b>transport</b> and <b>logistics</b> system in Northeast Asia. The current research was facilitated by experts mainly from the <b>transport</b> and <b>logistics</b> field in Northeast Asia, through the application of the Delphi Method. The consensus achieved will provide useful guidance for building a well integrated <b>transport</b> and <b>logistics</b> system in Northeast Asia. The political and economic stability of North Korea is a prerequisite for <b>transport</b> and <b>logistics</b> system construction in Northeast Asia.
