5|$|The Allied {{air forces}} carried out several bombing raids on Mimoyecques between November 1943 and June 1944 but caused little damage. The bombing {{disrupted}} the construction {{project and the}} initial raids of 5 and 8 November 1943 caused work to be delayed for about a month. The Germans subsequently decided to abandon the western site, where work had not progressed very far, and concentrated on the eastern site. On 6 July 1944 the Royal Air Force began bombing the site with ground-penetrating <b>Tallboy</b> bombs. One <b>Tallboy</b> hit the concrete slab on top of Drift IV, collapsing the drift. Three others penetrated the tunnels below and substantially damaged the facility, causing several of the galleries to collapse in places.|$|E
5|$|Although the Mk. XIV {{was not as}} {{accurate}} as the Norden at altitudes over , for typical night bombing altitudes from , any differences in accuracy were minor. When {{the need for more}} accuracy for use with the <b>Tallboy</b> bombs arose in 1943, the Stabilized Automatic Bomb Sight (SABS), a development of the ABS, was introduced in limited numbers.|$|E
5|$|Tirpitzs {{career was}} less dramatic; {{she was sent}} to Norwegian waters in 1942, where she acted as a fleet in being, {{threatening}} the convoys from Britain to the Soviet Union. She was repeatedly attacked by the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. In 1944, Lancaster bombers hit the ship with three <b>Tallboy</b> bombs, which caused extensive internal damage and capsized the battleship. Tirpitz was broken up for scrap between 1948 and 1957.|$|E
50|$|The viaducts were {{attacked}} by 617 and 9 squadrons with <b>Tallboys</b> and the first Grand Slams. The Arnsberg viaduct withstood the attack but 100 m of the Bielefeld viaduct collapsed through the 'earthquake effect' of the Grand Slams and <b>Tallboys.</b>|$|R

5|$|The E-boats laid up in {{the shelters}} during the day, safe from air–attack, and put to sea under cover of night to attack Allied shipping. The pens were {{priority}} targets as the torpedo boats they protected were a considerable threat to the supply lines serving Allied forces in western Europe. Since August 1944, the two bunkers had been attacked four times by No. 9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron of the RAF, {{with a total of}} 53 of the five–ton, <b>Tallboy</b> earthquake bombs. There had been numerous other attacks from bombers carrying smaller, conventional bombs.|$|E
5|$|A later report {{covering}} the use the <b>Tallboy</b> bomb {{was able to}} directly compare {{the performance of the}} Mk. XIV and SABS in similar mission profiles. Eliminating bombs that fell far from the target as gross errors, those that fell near the target were twice as close to it when using SABS. Additionally, the number of gross errors with the Mk. XIV was double that of the SABS. The report noted that this additional accuracy did not confer any sort of superiority because the Mk. XIV's tactical freedom in terms of manoeuvring offset any advantage when a long bomb run was not possible. They also noted that a mission using SABS to drop bombs on a target marker would not be any more accurate than the Mk. XIV.|$|E
5|$|As Tirpitz {{was still}} {{considered}} {{a threat to}} shipping, the British Chiefs of Staff Committee and the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided in late August to conduct further attacks against her using Royal Air Force heavy bombers. On 15 September, a force of Avro Lancasters attacked Kaafjord after refuelling at bases in northern Russia and inflicted irreparable damage on the battleship. Following this raid she sailed to an anchorage near Tromsø {{to be used as}} an immobile coastal defence battery. Another heavy bomber attack on 29 October caused only minor damage, but in a third raid mounted on 12 November, Tirpitz was struck by several <b>Tallboy</b> bombs and capsized, sinking with heavy loss of life.|$|E

5|$|As the {{intelligence}} {{available to them}} was not conclusive, the Allies believed that Tirpitz still posed a potential threat. Accordingly, Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons made two further attacks on the battleship after she moved to Tromsø on 15 October; these operations were more straightforward to conduct than Operation Paravane as the port was {{within the range of}} Lancasters flying from airfields in northern Scotland. The first raid, Operation Obviate, took place on 29 October but caused only minor damage to the battleship. During the subsequent attack conducted on 12 November, Operation Catechism, Tirpitz was struck by several <b>Tallboy</b> bombs and capsized with heavy loss of life among her crew.|$|E
5|$|Kaafjord's {{defenders}} {{detected the}} Lancasters approximately {{ten minutes before}} they arrived, and the protective smokescreen was beginning to form when the attack commenced at 10:55am GMT. Only {{the first group of}} Lancasters, led by Tait, were able to aim their bombs at Tirpitz before she was obscured by smoke. It is believed that the bomb dropped from Tait's aircraft struck the battleship, and the other bombs dropped by this group landed in the water nearby. All the other Force A aircraft aimed their Tallboys at the anti-aircraft gunfire rising from the ship; 17 of the weapons were dropped. Several Lancasters made more than one pass over the target area as their bomb aimers sought to locate Tirpitz or technical problems prevented their <b>Tallboy</b> from being dropped on the initial pass.|$|E
5|$|The Lancasters' {{flight to}} Yagodnik {{initially}} went well. After departing their bases, the 39 aircraft flew {{north to the}} Shetlands before turning east. During {{the early stages of}} the flight one of the No. 9 Squadron Lancasters was forced to dump its <b>Tallboy</b> into the North Sea after it became decoupled from its mounting; the bomber subsequently returned to base. The remaining aircraft passed over neutral Sweden where the aircrew, most of whom had only conducted night flying over countries observing blackouts, were pleased to see towns lit up. After crossing the Gulf of Bothnia the Lancasters continued over Finland towards the USSR. Several aircraft were fired on by Swedish, Finnish and Soviet anti-aircraft defences, but only one suffered any damage.|$|E

5|$|Tirpitz was {{rendered}} {{unfit for}} combat by Operation Paravane. The <b>Tallboy</b> bomb that struck the battleship {{passed through the}} foredeck and hull, and exploded in the water on the starboard side of her bow. This damage wrecked the bow, and left the battleship's forward compartments flooded with 2,000 tons of water. The explosions of several other Tallboys in the water near Tirpitz also buckled some of her hull plates and bulkheads. The battleship's casualties were not heavy, with five men killed and fifteen wounded. The damage was assessed as needing nine months' worth of work to repair. After reporting on the damage, Tirpitzs commanding officer, Kapitän zur See Wolf Junge, recommended to the German Navy's high command that the battleship be removed from service.|$|E
5|$|Force B {{commenced}} its attack {{after the}} <b>Tallboy</b> Lancasters had completed theirs {{so that the}} shock waves from bomb explosions did not prematurely set off the JW mines. As none of the Force B aircrew were able to spot Tirpitz due to the smokescreen, they dropped the mines on the battleship's estimated position. These weapons did not cause any damage. The smokescreen over Kaafjord prevented the Allied aircrew {{from being able to}} assess the results of their bombing, though several large spouts of water and explosions were observed. Tait was also pleased to see a column of black smoke rising through the smokescreen. However, some of the bombs and mines landed up to a mile from the battleship. Tirpitzs anti-aircraft guns and a further 98 guns located in nearby shore batteries and warships fired on the bombers throughout the attack. However, only four Lancasters suffered any damage.|$|E
5|$|In late August it {{was decided}} that further Fleet Air Arm attacks should not be {{attempted}} as the Germans were now able to cover Tirpitz in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. As it was still seen as desirable to destroy Tirpitz, the task was assigned to Bomber Command. On 15 September a force of heavy bombers attacked Kaafjord after refuelling at bases in northern Russia and inflicted irreparable damage on the battleship. Following this, Tirpitz sailed to an anchorage near Tromsø to be used as an immobile coastal defence battery. Another heavy bomber attack on 29 October caused only minor damage, and a third raid was mounted on 12 November in which Tirpitz was struck by several <b>Tallboy</b> bombs and capsized with heavy loss of life among her crew.|$|E
6000|$|Cecil was by {{no means}} {{prepared}} for the scene. The drawing-room was crowded--chiefly indeed with ladies and children, but there was a fair sprinkling of gentlemen--and all had their faces turned towards the great glass doors opening into the conservatory, which was brilliantly lighted and echoing with music and laughter. Cecil tried to summon some of the ladies of her own inviting, announcing that Mrs. <b>Tallboys</b> was arrived; but this appeared to have no effect. [...] "Yes, thank you," [...] was all she heard. Penetrating a little farther, [...] "Mrs. <b>Tallboys</b> is ready." [...] "Thank you, I'll come; but my little people are so anxious to have me with them."--"Mrs. <b>Tallboys</b> is waiting!"

6000|$|That day {{she wrote}} to Mr. <b>Tallboys,</b> giving him a full account of the {{discovery}} which she had made, and inclosing the fragment of his letter. She did not renew her search {{for the next two}} nights; for her long watchfulness and excitement had told upon her, and she felt that she needed rest before she set about {{the second part of the}} search.

5|$|The {{designers}} {{conceived the}} Tallboys as town criers. Stilts were later added after Mitton noticed someone cleaning their office façade while wearing stilts; the town crier role {{was replaced with}} loudspeakers throughout Dunwall. The <b>Tallboy</b> design evolved into a lamplighter that would light street lamps with whale oil tanks, but after further development, the designers considered that their tall, mechanical legs allowed them to burn the dead and deal with plague-infected citizens while remaining above them and avoiding infection, leading to their final design as a guard armed with a bow. Mitton suggested adding a phosphorus canister to the Tallboys' backs for aesthetic reasons, but Smith suggested whale oil, which in turn led Mitton to design the whaling ships to give the whales a visible presence in the city. For other technologies, designers conceptualized using 18th-century technology to build modern items and vehicles, and creating 18th-century items using modern tools.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, on 8 April, Prinz Eugen and Lützow steamed to Swinemünde. On 13 April, 34 Lancaster bombers {{attacked the}} two ships while in port. Thick cloud cover forced the British to abort {{the mission and}} return two days later. On the second attack, they succeeded in sinking Lützow with a single <b>Tallboy</b> bomb hit. Prinz Eugen then departed Swinemünde for Copenhagen, arriving on 20 April. Once there, she was decommissioned on 7 May and turned over to Royal Navy control the following day. For his leadership of Prinz Eugen in {{the final year of}} the war, Reinicke was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 21 April 1945. Prinz Eugen was mentioned twice in Wehrmachtbericht during her operational career, the first time on 13 February 1942 and the second time on 18 May 1942.|$|E

25|$|The German {{battleship}} Tirpitz {{was attacked}} on multiple occasions by Allied forces during World War II. While most the attacks failed to inflict any {{damage on the}} battleship, she was placed out of action for a lengthy period following the Operation Source midget submarine attack on 22 September 1943 and {{for a short period}} after the Operation Tungsten aircraft carrier strike on 3 April 1944. Tirpitz suffered severe and irreparable damage after being hit by a <b>Tallboy</b> bomb during the Operation Paravane air raid on 15 September 1944, and was sunk with heavy loss of life in the Operation Catechism raid on 12 November that year.|$|E

After completing pilot training, Stanford was posted to No. 467 Squadron RAAF in August 1943, stationed in the United Kingdom. He remained with the squadron until February 1944, when he was posted to No. 617 Squadron RAF, which also flew Lancasters. During his time with No. 467 Squadron, Stanford flew 23 operations and was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross. His first operation was flown {{on the night of}} 5/6 September 1943 against a target in Mannheim. He flew a further 24 operations with No. 617 Squadron, including a decoy operation around Cap d'Antifer during the invasion of Normandy, and an attack on the railway tunnel at Saumur with 12,000-pound <b>Tallboy</b> bombs in the days following the landing. He reached the rank of flight lieutenant and was later seconded to the Ministry of Aircraft Production to visit aircraft manufacturing plants to speak to workers.|$|E
