25|$|I {{was playing}} good golf, {{but it really}} wasn't {{that big a deal}} to me one way or the other. And <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> died and I sort of {{realized}} that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of got myself back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was a big boost.|$|E
60|$|Thus, <b>then,</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> prospered the wickedness of Zinita, {{the head}} wife of Umslopogaas, my fosterling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps... Ah, Ventre Dieu, {{my mother}} is right! Let the matter rest, <b>then,</b> <b>my</b> <b>father.</b> We will talk of it again {{as soon as you}} are well." ...|$|E
6000|$|Two years passed, and <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> manner changed. From being {{bright and}} cheerful toward us he became moody and silent. What {{the cause was}} I could not guess, {{and it did not}} help matters to be told by Duncan Woodward, whose father was also {{employed}} by Holland & Mack, that [...] "some folks would soon learn what was what, and no mistake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For a time I {{could not}} believe the heresies which I heard, and I prayed that my {{daughter}} Thuvia might have died before she ever committed the sacrilege of returning to the outer world. But <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> love asserted itself, and I vowed that I would prefer eternal damnation to further separation from her if she could be found.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{all laughed}} <b>then,</b> and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> said, hypocritically, 'I {{was just going}} to ask Felix whether he {{expected}} to start East this week or next.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Caryll stared, startled {{out of his}} {{habitual}} calm. Rotherby {{turned to}} her with an exclamation of surprise. [...] "How?" [...] he cried. [...] "You knew, <b>then?</b> <b>My</b> <b>father</b> was--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then,</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> I grew cold indeed--yes, I grew cold who soon {{should be}} hot, for I saw {{the purpose of}} Chaka. He would put me to the trial by fire.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then,</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> I, Mopo, acted wisely, {{because of}} the thought which my good spirit gave me, for I cast myself upon the ground, and wailed aloud as though in utter grief.|$|E
6000|$|CHORUS: There stop! I saw him giving {{these things}} to the strangers. [...] 250 If I speak false, <b>then</b> may <b>my</b> <b>father</b> perish, But do not thou wrong hospitality.|$|R
5000|$|In February, in an {{interview}} with the BBC, Githongo told of his meeting with Kiraitu, during which the then Justice minister tried to blackmail him over a loan his (Githongo's) father is said to owe businessman Anura Pereira. [...] "The minister of Justice was telling me that if I eased off <b>my</b> inquiries, <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> loan matter would be made to go away," [...] Githongo said. He had an audiotape, which was played on the BBC.|$|R
6000|$|... "O yes," [...] cried Elizabeth, {{with tears}} in her eyes. [...] "I would, indeed--I would do {{anything}} to be independent; for <b>then</b> perhaps <b>my</b> <b>father</b> might get to love me. But, ah!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes! Away {{even from}} the Paris edition of the New York Herald. But <b>then,</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> you know, is terribly mercenary. I believe he thinks that there is scope for the {{capitalist}} here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Just <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> came in {{and began}} making {{preparations}} to depart with me. Ernest returned some books he had borrowed, and went away first. But {{just as he was}} going, he turned and said: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> kissed me, and I never {{remember}} of his having {{done such a}} thing before, after which he went over the rail hurriedly, as if not caring to {{look me in the}} face.|$|E
6000|$|Ulr. [...] Stralenheim {{knows nothing}} [...] Of me as aught of kindred with yourself. [...] I will {{but wait a}} day or two with him [...] To lull all doubts, and <b>then</b> rejoin <b>my</b> <b>father.</b>|$|R
60|$|There is {{unhappiness}} {{so great}} that the very fear of it is an alloy to happiness. I had <b>then</b> lost <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> and sister, and brother,--have since lost another sister and my mother;--but I have never as yet lost a wife or a child.|$|R
60|$|Just <b>then</b> up jumped <b>my</b> <b>father</b> near to Giles, {{and came}} leaping {{in front of}} the Red-faced Man about twenty yards away from him.|$|R
60|$|We {{descended the}} steep {{hillside}} path and stood together almost {{on the threshold}} of the little monastery. <b>Then</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> held out his hand to me, and a soft, sweet light shone for a moment in his dark blue eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I was young, {{before my}} miseries. Oh, I was wide awake, <b>then.</b> <b>My</b> <b>father</b> {{was a great}} commercant; he placed me for {{a year in a}} counting-house in England. Some of it stuck to me; but I have forgotten!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I murmured, 'Your {{life seemed}} to require it,' {{but she did}} not hear me. She sank down in a chair, covered her face, and <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> came in. 'O, here you are!' he said. 'I could not find you. And Caroline!' ...|$|E
60|$|I started. My heart almost {{ceased to}} beat {{when the next}} man was led forward. He was <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> man-servant, Edwards. In the {{confusion}} and horror of that hour I could not reason; but a vague sense of some mysterious impossibility having actually taken place, oppressed {{me in a way}} that I cannot explain. The ship had sailed the day before ours did! I left Edwards behind me in the race from home! How, then, did I see him before me? Then the cage of wild beasts. How was it possible that a vessel leaving an English port could have such creatures on board? <b>Then,</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> letter; it seemed more than ever mysterious how that letter could reach me, and through such a channel, and without a word of reference to Edwards.|$|R
6000|$|... "We do not know. As long as Lady Alison lived (his aunt) she let us {{hear about}} him, {{and we knew}} he was {{recovering}} from his wound. Then came her death, and <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's,</b> and all the rest, and we lost sight of the Beauchamps. We saw the name in the Gazette as killed at Lucknow, but not the right Christian name nor the same rank; but then, though the regiment is come home, we have heard nothing of him, and though she has never spoken of him to me, I am sure Ermine believes he is dead, and thinks of him as part of the sunshine of the old Beauchamp days--the sunshine whose reflection lasts one's life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{know that}} <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{will go to}} my people. His head is grey, and his words will not be blown away with the smoke. Let him get on my lodge, and call the name of Hard-Heart aloud. No Pawnee will be deaf. <b>Then</b> let <b>my</b> <b>father</b> ask for the colt, {{that has never been}} ridden, but which is sleeker than the buck, and swifter than the elk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Methinks, methinks {{there were}} serving-men that called me the young Lord. Ay, so! But nurse said I must forget all that. Mother dear, when that maiden came and talked of tilts and lances, meseemed that I recollected somewhat. Was <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> a knight?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oswald was not there. That I know is {{what you}} mean to ask. Papa said that he might come if he pleased. Oswald stipulated {{that he should be}} {{received}} as a son. <b>Then</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> spoke the hardest word that ever fell from his mouth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Louisa!" [...] roared {{my father}} down the kitchen stairs, [...] "are you all asleep? Here have I {{had to answer}} the front door myself." [...] <b>Then</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> strode into his office, and the door slammed. My father could be very angry when nobody was by.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me, <b>then,</b> why <b>my</b> <b>father</b> {{asked you}} here to-night? I can {{understand}} his bringing {{you to the}} opera, {{that was just a}} whim of the moment, but an invitation down here savours of deliberation. Studiously polite though you are to one another, one is conscious all the time of the hostility beneath the surface." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So much so,' said Rose, 'that the quarrel between <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and Fergus Mac-Ivor {{began at}} a county meeting, {{where he wanted}} to take {{precedence}} of all the Lowland gentlemen <b>then</b> present, only <b>my</b> <b>father</b> would not suffer it. And <b>then</b> he upbraided <b>my</b> <b>father</b> that he was under his banner, and paid him tribute; and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was in a towering passion, for Bailie Macwheeble, who manages such things his own way, had contrived to keep this black-mail a secret from him, and passed it in his account for cess-money. And they would have fought; but Fergus Mac-Ivor said, very gallantly, he would never raise his hand against a grey head that was so much respected as my father's.--O I wish, I wish they had continued friends!' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{other man}} saw us {{slipping}} through and ran {{at us with}} his stick. My mother went first and escaped him. <b>Then</b> came <b>my</b> sister, <b>then</b> I, <b>then</b> <b>my</b> brother. <b>My</b> <b>father</b> was last of all. The man hit with his stick and it came down thud along side of me, just touching my fur. He hit again and broke the foreleg of my brother. Still we all managed to get through into the wood, except <b>my</b> <b>father</b> who was behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had no alternative," [...] she said. [...] "I {{began to}} realize it after my mother's death. <b>Then</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was badly hurt in an {{accident}} with a team, and I came back. He has nobody else to look after him, and he is getting on in life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> came in {{and asked}} {{what all the fuss}} was about. I told him that we had caught a young white baboon, and he was angry, and said that it must be let go. But when he looked at it through the bars of the window he nearly fell down with astonishment.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay,' {{returned}} Robert, 'and {{with the}} tastes of an eldest son. His allowance does not suffice for them, {{and he does not}} like to see me independent. If my uncle had only been contented to let us share and share alike, <b>then</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> would have had no interest in drawing me into the precious gin and brandy manufacture.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Was it so indeed? <b>Then</b> by <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> spotless memory, And by the shameful {{manner of}} his death, And by the base {{betrayal}} by his friend, For these at least remain, by these I swear I will not lay my hand upon his life Until you bid me, then--God help his soul, For he shall die as never dog died yet. And now, the sign, what is it? ...|$|R
5000|$|This led {{directly}} to another event:"Although {{it was a very}} traumatic experience, something good came out of it. At fifteen, although still rather ignorant of some things, I was old enough to know that if it was wrong for my cousin to hug and kiss me, <b>then</b> what <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was doing to me was very, very wrong indeed ... I threatened <b>my</b> <b>father</b> that I would 'cry out' and cause a public scandal ... if he did not stop his inappropriate behaviour ... The abuse ended there and then; he was careful never to touch me again." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} that I did not much like his tone at the time, but {{set it down}} to an attack of low spirits, to which he grew very subject {{as the years went}} on. I went down to the kraal and watched till within an hour of sunrise; then, as no thieves appeared, returned to the station. As I came near I was astonished to see a figure sitting in <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> chair. At first I thought it must be a drunken Kaffir, <b>then</b> that <b>my</b> <b>father</b> had fallen asleep there.|$|R
