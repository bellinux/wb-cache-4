25|$|Consequentialism {{can also}} be contrasted with aretaic moral {{theories}} such as virtue ethics. Whereas consequentialist theories posit that consequences of action should be {{the primary focus of}} our thinking about ethics, virtue ethics insists that it is the character rather than the consequences of actions <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> focal point. Some virtue ethicists hold that consequentialist theories totally disregard the development and importance of moral character. For example, Philippa Foot argues that consequences in themselves have no ethical content, unless it has been provided by a virtue such as benevolence.|$|E
25|$|David J. Macpherson (b. 1854, Ontario, Canada), a civil {{engineer}} from Cornell University and a newcomer to Pasadena (1885), proposed a steam driven cog wheel train to reach the crest via Mount Wilson. It wasn't until he {{was introduced to the}} millionaire Thaddeus S. C. Lowe (arrived in Pasadena 1890) that a fully funded plan could be put into action. The two men visited Colorado to view the mountain railway to Pike's Peak. Lowe was impressed with the trolley car systems in the city and thought <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> way to go. This would make the Mount Lowe Railway the only electric traction rail line ever to be put into scenic mountain railway service.|$|E

25|$|Despite of {{politicians}} talks, Israeli public {{does not seem}} to share the same concern about the Iranian nuclear deal. Or rather, they do acknowledge that nuclear capability in Iran is a threat and they {{do not believe that the}} new agreement proposed by Obama will solve the situation. However, in recent polls, when asked to rank what is the major threat to Israeli security, Iran's nuclear power figured only in second position. Hamas and Hezbollah's terrorism is what concerns the most. Also when asked about internal issues, what figured as the highest concern for Israel's stability was the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians, not the Iranian nuclear threat. So, eventhough the population shares with the politicians the same concern about the nuclear threat, they do not think <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> countrie's first issue to deal with.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Paula Vitaris from CFQ {{gave the}} episode a {{negative}} review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She wrote, [...] "Instead of a grand, breath-taking, heart-breaking finale <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> climax of Mulder's search for Samantha, the story expires limply with some nonsense about Samantha {{being of the}} starlight children." [...] Bobby Bryant and Tracy Burlison of The State named the episode the [...] "Worst Conspiracy" [...] episode. The two noted that because [...] "a tenet of The X-Files was that Mulder's sister, Samantha, had been (a) kidnapped by aliens or (b) kidnapped by government conspirators", {{the fact that she}} had actually been turned into a spirit [...] "insanely offers a supernatural explanation to a science-fiction mystery".|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Anubhavam Pudhumai" [...] is {{loosely based}} on a 1940 Spanish song titled [...] "Bésame Mucho". Philips, an {{autodidact}} guitarist, played the guitar for [...] "Anubhavam Pudhumai" [...] and [...] "Malarendra Mugamondru". The original soundtrack edition omits the songs [...] "Maadimele" [...] and [...] "Kadhalikka Neramillai", which are included on the track list of Raaga.com; the website omits the song [...] "Viswanathan Velai Vendum" [...] which was included on the original soundtrack edition. Viswanathan {{and his wife were}} spending a vacation in Yercaud for a week, when Kannadasan, Gopu and Sridhar were waiting for him to begin composing the songs. The day when Viswanathan returned and arrived at Chithralaya office, Kannadasan said, [...] "Ennappa..Viswanathaa...Velai kodu.." [...] (...) [...] Sridhar then said <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the song and decided to give Balaiah's character the name Viswanathan.|$|E

500|$|At Whorf's death {{his friend}} G. L. Trager was {{appointed}} as curator of his unpublished manuscripts. Some {{of them were}} published in the years after his death by another of Whorf's friends, Harry Hoijer. In the decade following, Trager and particularly Hoijer did much to popularize Whorf's ideas about linguistic relativity, and it was Hoijer who coined the term [...] "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis" [...] at a 1954 conference. Trager then published an article titled [...] "The systematization of the Whorf hypothesis", which contributed to the idea that Whorf had proposed a hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> basis for a program of empirical research. Hoijer also published studies of Indigenous languages and cultures of the American South West in which Whorf found correspondences between cultural patterns and linguistic ones. The term, even though technically a misnomer, {{went on to become the}} most widely known label for Whorf's ideas. According to John A. Lucy [...] "Whorf's work in linguistics was and still is recognized as being of superb professional quality by linguists".|$|E

2500|$|June 15, William Patterson (NJ) {{proposed}} the Convention minority's New Jersey Plan. It was weighted toward {{the interests of}} the smaller, less populous states. The intent was to preserve the states from a plan to [...] "destroy or annihilate" [...] them. The New Jersey Plan was purely federal, authority flowed from the states. Gradual change should come from the states. If the Articles could not be amended, then advocates argued <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> report from the Convention to the states.|$|E

2500|$|Population {{viability}} analysis (PVA) is used {{to estimate}} {{the likelihood of a}} population’s extinction and indicate the urgency of recovery efforts, and identify key life stages or processes <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> focus of recovery efforts. [...] PVA is also used to compare proposed management options and assess existing recovery efforts. [...] PVA is frequently used in endangered species management to develop a plan of action, rank {{the pros and cons of}} different management scenarios, and assess the potential impacts of habitat loss.|$|E
2500|$|Four years later, one of {{the founders}} of modern utilitarianism, the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), {{although}} opposed to the concept of natural rights, argued that it was the ability to suffer <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> benchmark of how we treat other beings. If rationality were the criterion, he argued, many humans, including infants and the disabled, would also have to be treated as though they were things. He did not conclude that humans and nonhumans had equal moral significance, but argued that the latter's interests should be taken into account. He wrote in 1789, just as African slaves were being freed by the French: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} non-maleficence is {{embodied}} by the phrase, [...] "first, do no harm," [...] or the Latin, primum non nocere. Many consider <b>that</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> main or primary consideration (hence primum): {{that it is}} more important not to harm your patient, than to do them good. This is partly because enthusiastic practitioners are prone to using treatments that they believe will do good, without first having evaluated them adequately to ensure they do no (or only acceptable levels of) harm. Much harm has been done to patients as a result, as in the saying, [...] "The treatment was a success, but the patient died." [...] It is not only more important to do no harm than to do good; {{it is also important to}} know how likely it is that your treatment will harm a patient. So a physician should go further than not prescribing medications they know to be harmful—he or she should not prescribe medications (or otherwise treat the patient) unless s/he knows that the treatment is unlikely to be harmful; or at the very least, that patient understands the risks and benefits, and that the likely benefits outweigh the likely risks.|$|E
