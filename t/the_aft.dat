5|$|An {{experimental}} fire-control {{director was}} fitted {{in the forward}} spotting top and evaluated in May 1910. The guns on the forward turret roof were transferred to the superstructure in 1913–1914 and the roof guns from the wing turrets were remounted in <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> superstructure about a year later; all of the four-inch guns in the superstructure were enclosed to better protect their crews. In addition, a single three-inch (76mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added on the former searchlight platform between <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> turrets. Shortly afterwards, the guns on <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> turret were removed as were one pair from the superstructure. Around the same time another three-inch AA gun was added to <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> turret roof.|$|E

Contrary to <b>the</b> <b>AFT’s</b> high-minded rhetoric of global labor solidarity, philanthropic goodwill, and democracy promotion, the authors argue that <b>the</b> <b>AFT’s</b> Middle East programs serve U.

5|$|The pole {{foremast}} {{was modified}} to a tripod after 1916. This {{was due to}} the increased weight of masthead fire-control equipment associated with director firing. In 1917 Lion and Princess Royal received searchlight towers on <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> funnel and mainmast while losing one four-inch gun each from <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> battery. In early 1918, both ships received flying-off platforms on 'Q' and 'X' turrets for Sopwith Pup and Sopwith 1½ Strutter aircraft, and Lion was fitted with a torpedo control station at <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> end of her aft superstructure.|$|E
5|$|After takeoff, Cooper told Mucklow to {{join the}} rest of the crew in the cockpit and remain there with the door closed. As she complied, Mucklow {{observed}} Cooper tying something around his waist. At approximately 8:00pm, a warning light flashed in the cockpit, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> airstair apparatus had been activated. The crew's offer of assistance via the aircraft's intercom system was curtly refused. The crew soon noticed a subjective change of air pressure, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> door was open.|$|E
5|$|Defence {{received}} a QF 12-pounder (3-inch) 12 cwt anti-aircraft (AA) gun and a QF 3-pounder (47mm) AA gun in 1915–16. The 12-pounder gun was mounted on <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> superstructure and the 3-pounder on the quarterdeck {{at the extreme}} rear.|$|E

5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind the forward funnel {{to allow the}} vertical leg {{to serve as a}} support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the foremast moved forward of the funnels to reduce the problem in the spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> funnel to do that, which rendered <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both funnels under certain circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Canada was {{transferred}} to the 1st Battle Squadron on 12 June 1916. In 1917–18, she was fitted with better rangefinders and range dials, and two of <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> 6-inch secondary guns were removed after they suffered blast damage from the middle 14-inch turret. In the latter year, flying-off platforms for aircraft were added atop the superfiring turrets fore and aft. Canada was put into the reserve fleet in March 1919.|$|E
5|$|In 1917–18 the 12-pounder AA gun {{mounted on}} <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> {{superstructure}} {{was moved to}} the roof of the forward 9.2-inch gun turret and a fire-control system was installed with a director mounted on a platform fitted to the foremast. Minotaur was paid off on 5 February 1919, placed on the disposal list in May, put up for sale in March 1920 and sold the following month.|$|E
5|$|Of the ratings, 122 were Royal Marines. As an {{experiment}} during the ship's first commission, all of Warriors marines were from Royal Marine Artillery; subsequently some marine infantrymen were assigned {{as was the}} usual naval practice.

50|$|On May 26, 1934, the Ohio State Federation of Teachers (as the OFT was {{originally}} known) met in convention was in Springfield. Irvin Kuenzli, {{president of the}} Springfield Federation of Teachers, was elected the organization's first president.

5|$|The DNC {{objected to}} the loss of the {{mainmast}} as he believed that it was needed to support a boat-handling derrick, but was overruled by the Admiralty, which preferred to position the tripod foremast behind the forward funnel with the tripod legs facing forward to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable. The short height of the funnel also bedevilled the bridge with smoke until it was raised in 1912, although this exacerbated the problem for the spotting top. The decision to space the wing turrets more closely together also made the smoke problem worse; because it reduced the space available to <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> boiler room which meant that the forward funnel had to accommodate the exhausts of a dozen boilers compared to <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> funnel's six, further increasing the smoke from the forward funnel.|$|E
5|$|The Fire Control Switchboard {{configured}} the battery. With it, the Gunnery Officer could mix {{and match}} the three turrets to the two GFCSs.

5|$|The Mississippi ships had poor {{seakeeping}} qualities, {{making them}} poor gunnery platforms underway in Atlantic waters. Their motion was irregular, and their low length-to-beam ratio caused excessive rolling and pitching, {{which made it}} difficult to keep the guns on target. The reduced length, significantly cut away from <b>the</b> <b>aft,</b> {{made it difficult to}} keep the ships on a consistent course, even in smoother waters.|$|E

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} the above observations, there exist several {{probable}} cases of the nonlinear relationships between various <b>AFTs</b> and <b>the</b> weight percentages of the individual oxides present in the coal ashes. Thus, it is necessary to explore nonlinear models for the prediction of <b>the</b> four <b>AFTs.</b> Such models are expected to better capture the relationships between <b>the</b> <b>AFTs</b> and <b>the</b> seven oxides in the coal ash and, thereby, make more accurate predictions than the linear models. Towards this objective, in the present study, three computational intelligence (CI) based data-driven modeling formalisms (GP, ANN, and SVR) have been employed for the prediction of <b>the</b> four <b>AFTs</b> from <b>the</b> knowledge of the mineral composition (oxides) of the coal ashes. The objective of developing multiple models for each AFT is to afford a comparison of their prediction and generalization performances and thereby selecting the best prediction model.|$|R

5|$|The ship's {{anti-aircraft}} battery was improved {{over the}} course of World War II. In late 1942, a pair of Army-variant 2cm Flakvierling quadruple mounts were installed, one on the navigating bridge and the other on top of <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> superfiring turret. In May 1944, the navy proposed installing several Bofors 40 mm guns, but most of these weapons were diverted to other uses, and only two guns were installed. One was mounted on the bridge and the other where the catapult had been located. Two Navy-pattern Flakvierlings were added; one replaced the Army model atop <b>the</b> <b>aft</b> superfiring turret, and the other was placed in front of the anti-aircraft fire director. The Army-pattern Flakvierlings were moved to the main deck. In December 1944, another revised anti-aircraft plan was proposed, this time incorporating the new 3.7 cm FlaK 43 gun, of which there were to be eight, along with two Flakvierlings and ten 2cm twin mounts. Germany's wartime situation by the end of 1944 prevented these changes from being made, however.|$|E
