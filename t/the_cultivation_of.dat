5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially <b>the</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After {{the abolition of slavery}} in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for <b>the</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E

5|$|All organisms can exhibit behaviours. Even plants express complex behaviour, {{including}} {{memory and}} communication. Behavioural ecology {{is the study}} of an organism's behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications. Ethology {{is the study of}} observable movement or behaviour in animals. This could include investigations of motile sperm of plants, mobile phytoplankton, zooplankton swimming toward the female egg, <b>the</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> fungi by weevils, the mating dance of a salamander, or social gatherings of amoeba.|$|E

The incorporation of CR increased <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>cultivation</b> by 116 % {{in the first year}} and 114 % in the second year, whereas inoculation of biofertilizers increased <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> <b>cultivation</b> by 1.6 % in both years.|$|R

5|$|Galiella rufa is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} either solitarily, but more usually in groups or in clusters on decaying hardwood branches and logs.

5|$|One might {{surmise that}} the {{hermeneutic}} style was cultivated energetically in England {{in an attempt}} to show that English learning was as profound and English writing as sophisticated as anything produced on the Continent. The impetus for <b>the</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> the style in tenth-century England was therefore probably of Continental origin.|$|E

5|$|The {{book has}} also become popular among {{political}} leaders and those in business management.

5|$|The crop {{substitution}} programs successfully encouraged <b>the</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> tea, coffee, corn, {{and fruit}} trees, replacing the opium poppies {{that had previously}} been grown.

5|$|The {{major change}} in {{agriculture}} in Kerala occurred in the 1970s when production of rice fell due to increased availability of rice all over India and decreased availability of labour. Consequently, investment in rice production decreased and {{a major portion of}} the land shifted to <b>the</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> perennial tree crops and seasonal crops. Profitability of crops fell due to a shortage of farm labour, the high price of land, and the uneconomic size of operational holdings.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Oregon in the United States has {{established}} an international reputation for its production of wine, ranking {{fourth in the}} country behind California, Washington, and New York. Oregon has several different growing regions within the state's borders that are well-suited to <b>the</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> grapes; additional regions straddle the border between Oregon and the states of Washington and Idaho. Wine making dates back to pioneer times in the 1840s, with commercial production beginning in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The type genus, Lily (Lilium), has a {{long history}} in {{literature}} and art, and a tradition of symbolism as well as becoming a popular female name, and a floral emblem, particularly of France (fleur-de-lis). <b>The</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> lilies has been described since at least the ninth century, when Charlemagne ordered it to be grown at his imperial palaces.

5|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} of the Malagasy economy. Land is used for <b>the</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> rice and other crops, raising of zebu and other livestock, the fabrication of bricks and other traditional livelihoods. In Antananarivo, access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city. The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply {{and much of the}} unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Alfred D. Robinson (1866-1942) and {{his wife}} Marion James Robinson (1873-1919) were wealthy {{residents}} of San Diego, California known for their impact on gardening and <b>the</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> flowers, particularly begonias. Their extensive home garden was used to propagate and develop more than 100 new varieties of ornamental flowers and was later {{opened to the public}} as Rosecroft Begonia Gardens. Rosecroft was the name of their estate in the Point Loma neighborhood of San Diego. The residence, built for them in 1912, is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

30|$|As {{described}} above, {{the cost}} of sugi sawdust is relatively low, approximately one-third {{the cost of}} hardwood sawdust. Thus, the use of sugi sawdust for <b>the</b> sawdust-based <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> shiitake has been repeatedly attempted, but those attempts were not successful. If the method prepared by the mixing of sugi sawdust with kunugi media is used, {{it seems to be}} expected enough use of them in <b>the</b> sawdust-based <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> shiitake. Our results showed that the fruiting body yields in earlier flush stages in kunugi media partially mixed with sugi sawdust were better rather than those in the media only composed of kunugi sawdust. The effective utilization of unused overgrown kunugi wood and the cost reduction in <b>the</b> sawdust-based <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> shiitake could be achieved through its combination with inexpensive sugi sawdust, an industrial waste product.|$|R
5|$|By the 1830s {{the species}} was in {{cultivation}} in continental Europe. It was recorded as being cultivated {{in the garden}} of Karl von Hügel in Vienna, Austria in 1831, and in 1833 it was listed amongst the rare plants that had been introduced into Belgium. Along with several hundred other native Australian plants it was exhibited at plant shows held at Utrecht and Haarlem in the Netherlands in the 1840s and 1850s. By this time, however, English gardeners had already begun to lose interest in the Proteaceae, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century European interest in <b>the</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> Proteaceae was virtually non-existent.|$|E
5|$|Cacti {{are often}} grown in greenhouses, {{particularly}} in regions unsuited to <b>the</b> <b>cultivation</b> <b>of</b> cacti outdoors, such the northern parts of Europe and North America. Here, {{they may be}} kept in pots or grown in the ground. Cacti are also grown as houseplants, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then kept under cover during the winter. Less drought-resistant epiphytes, such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and Hatiora (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.|$|E
