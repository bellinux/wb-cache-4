5|$|A film {{adaptation}} of Dreamgirls, starring Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson, {{was released by}} DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures in December 2006. The film contains more overt references to Motown and the Supremes than does the play that inspired it: for example, in the film, many of the Dreams' album covers are identical in design to Supremes album covers, and <b>the</b> <b>Dreams</b> themselves hail from Detroit – not Chicago, as do their Broadway counterparts.|$|E

5|$|After the trial, doubts {{were raised}} {{about both the}} story of the {{stepmother}}'s dreams and the fate of Maria and William's child. The stepmother was only a year older than Maria, and it was suggested that she and Corder had been having an affair and that the two had planned the murder to dispose of Maria so that it could continue without hindrance. Her dreams had started only a few days after Corder married Moore, and it was suggested that jealousy was the motive for revealing the body's resting place and that <b>the</b> <b>dreams</b> were a simple subterfuge.|$|E

Development of Journey of Dreams began shortly after the release of Shadow the Hedgehog in 2005, and was headed by Sonic Team veteran Takashi Iizuka. The team took steps to ensure that the game stayed faithful to the original, while incorporating a variety of new mechanics and features.

Bell later moved to Dublin and joined an Irish showband named <b>The</b> <b>Dreams,</b> but left in 1969 {{with a view to}} forming a rock band. An acquaintance of Bell's, Belfast organist Eric Wrixon (29 June 1947 – 13 July 2015), also a former member of Them, had also moved to Dublin and joined the showband circuit, but had similar plans to progress towards rock music.|$|E
5|$|Kou Yaginuma's initial {{inspiration}} for the story came from a statement he once read describing the Hohner Little Lady harmonica {{as one of the}} first musical instruments taken into space. However, as an aspiring manga artist, Yaginuma had neither resources to conduct research on nor knowledge pertaining to spaceflight. He also hesitated to write the series because his own life experiences did not reflect <b>the</b> <b>dreams</b> of his characters. Despite these challenges, Yaginuma found comfort in the determination of his characters, especially that of Asumi Kamogawa.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1981, the Tony Award-winning musical Dreamgirls {{opened at}} the Imperial Theatre on Broadway and ran for 1,522 performances. The musical, loosely based {{on the history of}} the Supremes, follows the story of <b>the</b> <b>Dreams,</b> an all-female singing trio from Chicago who become music superstars. Several of the {{characters}} in the play are analogues of real-life Supremes/Motown counterparts, with the story focusing upon the Florence Ballard doppelgänger Effie White. While influenced by the Supremes' and Motown's music, the songs in the play are a broader mix of R/soul and Broadway music. Mary Wilson loved the musical, but Diana Ross was reportedly angered by it and refused to see it.|$|E

5|$|Other supernatural {{abilities}} commonly {{attributed to}} the kitsune include possession, mouths or tails that generate fire or lightning (known as kitsunebi), willful manifestation in <b>the</b> <b>dreams</b> of others, flight, invisibility, {{and the creation of}} illusions so elaborate as to be almost indistinguishable from reality. Some tales speak of kitsune with even greater powers, able to bend time and space, drive people mad, or take fantastic shapes such as a tree of incredible height or a second moon in the sky. Other kitsune have characteristics reminiscent of vampires or succubi and feed on the life or spirit of human beings, generally through sexual contact.|$|E

5|$|However, while {{pleasing}} to Riker's mind, the passionate dreams only worsen Riker's condition, as the virus feeds {{on the positive}} endorphins his brain is creating. Pulaski and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) therefore agree {{to try to make}} the machine evoke negative dreams instead. Thus Riker dreams of Lieutenant Tasha Yar's (Denise Crosby) death, or the apparent death of Deanna Troi's child (R. J. Williams). This has the desired effect, as the negative endorphins drive the virus away, but the endorphins are not strong enough. As a last resort, Pulaski uses the machine to evoke dreams of raw, primitive feelings of fear and survival. Thus Riker dreams of fighting the tar creature Armus (Mart McChesney), the alien-controlled Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello), and the Klingon officer Klag (Brian Thompson) on board the warship Pagh. Seeing that the raw emotions work best, Pulaski intensifies <b>the</b> <b>dreams</b> to come at a more rapid pace. This finally kills the virus and Riker recovers.|$|E

5|$|David 8 (Michael Fassbender) is Peter Weyland's {{synthetic}} {{assistant and}} {{the creator of}} the Aliens. The eighth in a line of David models representing Weyland's unfulfilled wish for a son, David was created by a middle-age Weyland, named after the eponymous Michelangelo statue. While the Prometheus is en route to LV-223, David studies the Engineers' (presumed) dialects, human culture and <b>the</b> <b>dreams</b> of the crew. After their arrival, David accompanies the expedition to the Juggernaut, where he acquires a vial of a black, extraterrestrial liquid. David contaminates a drink he gives Holloway to impregnate Shaw with an extraterrestrial life form. He explores the Juggernaut and cuts his feed to Vickers, giving Weyland private-screening access as he learns about a last-surviving Engineer in cryosleep. David prepares Weyland for the expedition to awaken the Engineer. He translates Weyland's request for immortality, and the Engineer decapitates him and kills the rest of the expedition except for Shaw. After Janek crashes the Prometheus into the Juggernaut, David's severed head warns Shaw that the Engineer is coming to kill her. He contacts her after she escapes from the life-support unit, telling her {{that he would like to}} help her escape LV-223 by piloting another Engineer ship. After Shaw recovers his head and body, he promises to take her to the Engineers' home world and they leave LV-223. David, whom Shaw has repaired, unleashes the mutagen on the Engineers' home world, wiping them out along with all other non-floral life. David conducts experiments with the mutagen to create the perfect organism, and using Shaw's body for the experiments. When an expedition from the colony ship Covenant arrives ten years later, David saves them from Neomorphs. He leads them to his base situated at the Engineer temple, where he becomes acquainted with his successor android, Walter, and lures Oram to get impregnated by a Facehugger, giving birth to the first Xenomorph. David is confronted by Walter about Shaw's fate, prompting David to disable him. David attacks Daniels, but is interrupted by the recuperated Walter. The two androids fight, with David emerging the victor and discretely assuming Walter's identity. After escaping to the Covenant, David coordinates the defense against the Alien that infiltrated the ship. After Daniels defeats the creature, David helps her and Tennessee into the sleeping pods. With Daniels in the pod, David reveals his true identity and puts her to sleep. David regurgitates two Facehugger embryos that he refrigerates with the human embryos and, impersonating Walter, sends out a transmission proclaiming that Daniels and Tennessee are the only survivors of the expedition.|$|E
5|$|The series {{revolves}} around the lives of Jaypaw, Lionpaw and Hollypaw, kits of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight and grandchildren of the ThunderClan leader Firestar. The three slowly {{come to terms with}} their unique paths in life; Lionpaw worries about his thirst for blood on the battlefield, Hollypaw considers {{what it means to be}} truly loyal to her Clan, and Jaypaw is bitter that he was born blind. One day, Jaypaw unintentionally discovers a prophecy that he believes refers to him and his siblings. The three attempt to understand their new destinies, and realize that Lionpaw has the power to never be harmed in battle, whilst Jaypaw can walk in <b>the</b> <b>dreams</b> and read the minds of other cats. Hollypaw, on the other hand, struggles to determine what her unique power is. Hollypaw and Lionpaw are made warriors, becoming Hollyleaf and Lionblaze respectively, whilst Jaypaw becomes a medicine cat and is later given the name Jayfeather. They seek the advice of a mysterious loner named Sol, who promises to give them the answers to their destinies; however, they eventually realize him to be a deceptive liar, and he is banished from the forest. Although uncertain of their powers, the three cats are always secure in the knowledge that they are deeply loved by their parents. This safe haven is shattered when they are forced into a fire by Ashfur, another ThunderClan warrior. Ashfur wishes to murder the three cats in order to punish their mother, Squirrelflight, for rejecting his love years earlier. However, Squirrelflight admits that the three cats are not her offspring, and Ashfur lets them go. The siblings are deeply distressed by this confession, and attempt to discover who their true parents are. They eventually learn that their mother is Leafpool, the ThunderClan medicine cat, and their father is Crowfeather, a WindClan warrior. Hollyleaf is devastated by this, and murders Ashfur in revenge. Unsatisfied, she then publicly announces to the rest of the Clans the true story of her heritage. When the Clans do not praise her for her honesty, but rather react with shock and confusion, Hollyleaf runs away into a series of collapsing tunnels. Presuming her to be dead, and numb with grief for their sister, Lionblaze and Jayfeather realize that Hollyleaf never had a power in the first place. They instead turn their eyes to two kits newly born in the Clan, one of whom could fulfill the third role in the prophecy.|$|E
