25|$|Roman Ghirshman {{took over}} {{direction}} of the French efforts in 1946, {{after the end of}} the war. Together with his wife Tania Ghirshman, he continued there until 1967. The Ghirshmans concentrated on excavating a single part of the site, the hectare sized Ville Royale, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the way down to bare earth. The pottery found at the various levels enabled a stratigraphy to be developed for Susa.|$|E
500|$|Smith sat out the 2007 {{season at}} Maryland on redshirt status, and was voted the scout team {{player of the}} year as a freshman. He was named the scout team player of the week before the Florida State game. In summer camp, Smith {{adjusted}} from playing quarterback to wide receiver, a position he had limited experience with in high school. Teammate Darrius Heyward-Bey said, [...] "He's like a sponge. He's <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in, asking a lot of questions—and that's good for a receiver." [...] In December, he practiced with the first team after Isaiah Williams suffered an injury.|$|E
2500|$|Hostetler {{returned}} {{for the next}} drive but the Giants went three-and-out. On the next play, New York called a fake punt with the ball snapped directly to linebacker Gary Reasons, the upback in the punt formation, and he ran 30 yards for a first down through an undermanned 49ers defense that had only sent 10 men on to the field. [...] Only a tackle by Taylor, the 49ers punt returner, prevented him from <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the way. Hostetler then drove the Giants to the opposing 21-yard line, but could get no further and nearly threw an interception on a third down pass toward the end zone. Bahr kicked his fourth field goal of the game with 5:47 left to bring the score to 13–12.|$|E

60|$|PARAMORE (conscientiously <b>taking</b> <b>it).</b> Not at <b>all.</b> You {{are quite}} in the right, Colonel Craven. My {{diagnosis}} was wrong; and I {{must take the}} consequences.|$|R
25|$|Another truck full of {{explosives}} went up, <b>taking</b> with <b>it</b> <b>all</b> my personal kit. That was another two trucks gone. My equipment was now reduced to an automatic pistol, a prismatic compass and one plated teaspoon. From now onwards I should be travelling light.|$|R
2500|$|Mark Foster {{graduated}} from Nordonia High School {{in the suburbs}} of Cleveland, Ohio. At his father's encouragement, Foster moved in with his uncle in Sylmar, Los Angeles, California to pursue a career in music. Foster worked various jobs and at night, he attended parties in Hollywood to expand his social network. He said, [...] "I felt like an 18-year-old Hunter S. Thompson. I was just diving into this Hollywood Hills subculture and <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in. I wasn't shy about taking my guitar out at a party. I wanted {{to be the center of}} attention." [...] At one time, he roomed with actor Brad Renfro. Foster struggled with drug addiction during his initial years in Los Angeles, saying, [...] "It got pretty dark. My friends thought I was going to die. I was blind to it. When I was 19 years old, it got to a point where I said, 'Enough is enough' ... I saw time was just passing me by. I wasn't being productive." ...|$|E

60|$|Indeed, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> for <b>all</b> in <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> {{seemed to}} me that, with the {{possible}} exception of being bitten by sharks, there was virtually no front-page disaster that could not happen to a fellow, once he had allowed his dear ones to override his better judgment and shove him out into the great unknown on a push-bike, and I am not ashamed to confess that, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> by and large, the amount of quailing I did from this point on was pretty considerable.|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy," [...] said John, [...] "the police must be <b>taking</b> a hand. <b>It's</b> <b>all</b> right. There's {{a little}} trouble down below there {{between two of the}} gangs. It won't last long now." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Bless my soul, what {{a capital}} old place!" [...] he ejaculated, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> {{in with an}} artist's keen appreciation. [...] "I feel as if I'd gone back a century, and the General might come in at any minute." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{length of}} the way, {{according}} {{to the best of}} my calculations, I reckoned to be about one hundred and seventy-five English miles, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> with <b>all</b> its windings and turnings, which were not a few, but which had this conveniency with them, that they gave a more easy and agreeable passage, and made the English proverb abundantly good, namely, that the farthest way about is the nearest way home.|$|R
50|$|But success {{came at a}} price. The paper's staff became {{increasingly}} insular, refusing to recruit members as older staffers graduated, believing itself capable of running on nothing. By Fall 1997, the staff dwindled to two editors, who produced only one mammoth issue. As the spring semester of 1998 opened, their layout computer crashed, <b>taking</b> with <b>it</b> <b>all</b> records and templates. The Federalist Paper was finished.|$|R
6000|$|If {{there had}} been a war, Milt would {{probably}} have been in it--rather casual, clearing his throat, reckoning and guessing that maybe his men might try going over and taking that hill ... then <b>taking</b> <b>it.</b> But <b>all</b> of this history concerns the year just before America spoke to Germany; and in this town buried among the cornfields and the wheat, men still thought more about the price of grain than about the souls of nations.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, 'squire, my mind's made up," [...] Thousandacres coolly rejoined. [...] "I'll sell, and gladly; {{but not on}} the tarms {{you have}} named. Two pounds eight the {{thousand}} foot, board measure, and <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> round, clear stuff and refuse, without any store-pay, will carry off the lumber." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{just this}} to say. It won't hurt you {{to lose a}} horse or two, and that's about all anybody has ever taken out of you, while it's quite likely you'll be worse off if you make trouble about it. In fact, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> around, you can't afford {{to get rid of}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're as bad," [...] {{said the}} widow, turning on him fiercely. [...] "All {{the time you}} two men were talking at each other you were {{laughing}} in your sleeves at me. And I sat there like a child <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in. I've no doubt you met every night and arranged what you were to do next day." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Taking</b> <b>it</b> for <b>all</b> in all, the German gunners {{had simply}} been beautifying London. The Albert Hall, {{struck by a}} merciful shell, had come down with a run, and was now a heap of picturesque ruins; Whitefield's Tabernacle was a charred mass; and the burning of the Royal Academy proved a great comfort to all. At a mass meeting in Trafalgar Square a hearty vote of thanks was passed, with acclamation, to Prince Otto.|$|R
50|$|Zimmer Corporation {{fell into}} serious {{economic}} distress and the $325 {{million a year}} parent company was forced into bankruptcy, <b>taking</b> down with <b>it</b> <b>all</b> of its operating divisions, including the highly successful and profitable $25 million a year car company.|$|R
25|$|The Quebec-based Ralliement des créditistes, {{which had}} won 14 seats in 1968 {{and was the}} 4th place party, reunited with the {{national}} Social Credit party, essentially <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> over. <b>All</b> seats won by the party in 1972 and subsequently were in Quebec. When the 1972 results are compared to the Railliement's 1968 results {{there is only a}} gain of 1 seat and an increase in the popular vote of 2.27 percentage points and no change in place.|$|R
60|$|Stone and Robinson felt secure. <b>Taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> around, {{they felt}} that they {{would just as soon}} play for Lower Borlock as for the school. The bowling of the {{opposition}} would be weaker in the former case, and the chance of making runs greater. To a certain type of cricketer runs are runs, wherever and however made.|$|E

[...] "She is <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> for granted, while {{it has yet to}} be arranged. I must apologize for coming in without knocking; but the child opened the door and rushed in, and {{the best thing to do}} was, we thought, to follow her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't exactly know," [...] replied Jerry. [...] "He {{said that}} he was going to lay in a supply of food for the winter, just as I told you, and I suppose that is what he is doing. But I don't quite {{understand}} what he is <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> out into the pond for. I believe I'll go ask him." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{shall have}} to hark back a bit. And <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> for <b>all</b> in all and {{weighing}} this against that, I suppose the affair {{may be said to}} have had its inception, if inception is the word I want, with that visit of mine to Cannes. If I hadn't gone to Cannes, I shouldn't have met the Bassett or bought that white mess jacket, and Angela wouldn't have met her shark, and Aunt Dahlia wouldn't have played baccarat.|$|R
5000|$|In 1976, CN placed {{operation}} {{of all its}} passenger services under a new division using the marketing slogan [...] "Via".

5|$|In the end a {{total of}} 28 {{architectural}} firms registered their intent to submit entries to the competition—a lower number than expected, but Richardson suggests {{this may have been}} due to work on proposals for the new Adelaide railway station.

60|$|<b>Taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in all, {{as nearly}} as a {{landsman}} like me could figure it, {{there must have}} been among that shipping of his majesty's no less than one hundred and eighty-six guns, with somewhere about twelve to thirteen hundred men. In addition to these, General Gage could transport anywhere from five to eight thousand men, landing them upon Charlestown shore close under our noses.|$|E
