40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to show the {{correlation}} between <b>materials</b> <b>science</b> and the study of extraterrestrial matter, especially meteorites. Design/methodology/approach: Raman Spectroscopy and Cathodoluminescence (CL) are two main methods used by Author to characterize meteorites. Findings: Understanding laboratory techniques for manufacturing different materials (e. g. diamond) helps to understand the processes taking place in space. Conversely, the new findings and discoveries give new insight applicable <b>to</b> <b>material</b> <b>science</b> and laboratory techniques. Research limitations/implications: The possibilities of creating new <b>materials</b> similar <b>to</b> those found in meteorites is shown in the paper.
