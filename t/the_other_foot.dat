5|$|In early 1944, Freyberg {{was made}} {{commander}} of the New Zealand Corps, newly formed for the Battle of Monte Cassino, while Kippenberger was promoted to temporary major-general and made {{commander of the}} 2nd Division. This was the pinnacle of his military career. The division had moved into the line around Cassino, replacing the U.S. 36th Infantry Division, which had been attacking the strongly defended German positions. The first attack by the New Zealanders on 17 February was unsuccessful despite {{the bombing of the}} Monte Cassino abbey, which Kippenberger supported. A second attack was planned for 20 February, but it was delayed by bad weather. On 2 March, Kippenberger climbed the slopes of nearby Mount Trocchio to gain an overview of the Cassino battlefield. Near the top of the mountain, he triggered a land mine which exploded and injured both legs to the extent that one foot was severed in the blast. He was evacuated to a medical centre, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot</b> and the lower portions of both legs were amputated. When the news of his injuries spread to the men of the 2nd New Zealand Division, it was met with some disbelief and shock, greatly affecting morale.|$|E
25|$|The {{affected}} limb usually lands toe-first, {{wearing down}} that foot {{faster than the}} other. The affected limb usually has a shorter, lower arc than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot,</b> as the horse is trying to reduce the painful flexion of the joint, so the leg appears to drag.|$|E
25|$|A crane {{standing}} {{on one leg}} (usually with a stone held in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot)</b> may be called vigilant or in its vigilance (e.g. Waverley Borough Council's Crane in its vigilance). A stone is usually shown held in the claw of the raised leg. This is as per the Bestiary myth that Cranes stayed awake by doing so. If it dozed, the Crane would supposedly drop the rock, waking itself up.|$|E

50|$|Toe wrestling {{is similar}} to arm wrestling. To play, players must take off their shoes and socks as {{the game is played}} with bare feet. It is common {{courtesy}} for each player to remove <b>the</b> <b>other</b> player's shoes and socks. Players must link toes and each player's foot must touch flat on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> person's <b>foot.</b> <b>The</b> opponents proceed to attempt to pin (capture or trap) <b>the</b> <b>other's</b> <b>foot</b> for three seconds while avoiding the same. There are 3 rounds played on a best 2 out of 3 basis. First with the right foot, then left, and right again if necessary.|$|R
25|$|After {{giving up}} 34 {{unanswered}} points, Oakland {{finally managed to}} drive 82 yards down the field and score on a 39-yard touchdown pass from Gannon to receiver Jerry Porter. Although he was initially ruled as being out of bounds when he caught the ball, {{it was determined that}} Porter had one foot in the end zone and used it to drag <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot</b> out. The two-point conversion failed, so the Raiders were still down 34–9.|$|E
25|$|The {{affected}} leg {{usually has}} one foot {{that is in}} an approximately normal position. The extra foot is composed of at least some metatarsal or tarsal bones and extra digits, though it is usually not complete. The feet can be joined together, so that the limb appears to have one large foot, or the extra foot can be joined to the limb separately, usually above the level of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot.</b> Diplopodia affects {{one or both of}} the hind limbs.|$|E
25|$|Straight dance (or Southern traditional): Straight dancers {{usually are}} more neat {{and with more}} {{homemade}} features such as chokers, breastplates, etc. Their dances are like Northern, They take one foot and step on the ball of their foot and then they tap it once on the ground. Then they tap it once again but this time they put their heel a few milimeters above the ground and repeat the process with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot.</b> They {{do this in a}} walking motion. it is very hard especially if you have to follow the beat of fast drums. If they catch themselves off beat they will tap their foot three times instead of two to get back with the drums' rhythm.|$|E

50|$|The trochaic septenarius is a catalectic line; that is, it {{consists}} of eight trochaic feet, with the last a half-foot. Only the seventh foot is regularly trochaic. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>feet</b> can be varied with a spondee, dactyl, tribrach, or more rarely an anapaest. There is usually a diaeresis after the fourth foot. It is sometimes called catalectic trochaic tetrameter.|$|R
25|$|Next, Kurt Angle fought Kane. During the match, Angle {{executed}} Kane's signature flying clothesline. Confidently, Angle tried another, but Kane {{countered with}} a clothesline of his own. Later on, Kane attempted a Tombstone Piledriver, but Angle grabbed Kane's mask, distracting him enough for Angle to execute an Angle Slam. Angle applied the ankle lock on Kane, which was stopped when Kane reached the ropes. With Angle {{still holding the}} foot, Kane used <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot</b> to perform an enzuigiri. A top rope attack by Kane was prevented when Angle rushed to the corner and executed a belly to belly suplex on him. Kane tried a chokeslam but Angle reversed it into a roll-up using the ropes to win the match.|$|E
25|$|Netball {{rules do}} not permit players to let their landing foot touch the ground again if it is lifted at all while in {{possession}} of the ball, so players can take 1.5 steps while holding the ball. Pivoting does not count as a step. Players are entitled to balance on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot</b> if the landing foot is lifted. An infraction of this rule is usually called stepping or travelling , as in the similar rule in basketball. Consequently, {{the only way to}} move the ball towards the goal is to throw the ball to a teammate. The ball can be held by a player for less than three seconds at any time. A player may tap or deflect the ball, let it bounce and then take possession and throw it. The player cannot catch the ball with both hands, drop it and pick it up again; this is called a replayed ball. The duration before it is called a drop is determined by the umpire. These rules, combined with the restrictions on where one player of a particular position can move, ensure that everyone on the team is regularly involved in play.|$|E
25|$|In the County Championship {{match against}} Sussex at Hove in May, Botham {{came very close}} to his maiden century but was {{dismissed}} for 97, his highest score to date. The match was drawn. At the end of the month, Somerset played Gloucestershire in a remarkable match at Taunton. Batting first, Somerset scored 333 for seven (innings closed) and then, thanks to six for 25 by Botham, bowled out Gloucestershire for only 79. The follow-on was enforced but Gloucestershire proved a much tougher nut to crack second time around. With Zaheer Abbas scoring 141, they made 372 and left Somerset needing 118 to win. Botham took five for 125 in the second innings for a match analysis of 11 for 150, his maiden 10wM. This match ended {{the same way as the}} famous Test at Headingley in 1981 but the boot was on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot</b> for Botham here because he was on the team that enforced the follow-on – and lost. Mike Procter and Tony Brown did the damage and bowled Somerset out for 110 in 42 overs, Gloucestershire winning by just eight runs. Botham scored his maiden first-class century at Trent Bridge on Tuesday, 3 August in the County Championship game against Nottinghamshire (Notts) who won the toss and decided to bat first. Derek Randall scored 204* and the Notts innings closed at 364 for 4 (Botham one for 59). Somerset were 52 for one at close of play. On day two, Somerset scored 304 for 8 (innings closed) and Botham, batting at number six, scored 80. At close of play, Notts in their second innings were 107 for four, thus extending their lead to 167 with six wickets standing. On day three, Notts advanced to 240 for nine declared (Botham one for 16), leaving Somerset with a difficult target of 301. At 40 for two and with both their openers gone, Brian Close changed his batting order and summoned Botham to come in at number four. Close himself had gone in at three but he was out soon afterwards for 35. With support from Graham Burgess (78), Botham laid into the Notts bowling and scored an impressive 167 not out. Somerset reached 302 for four in only 65 overs and won by six wickets.|$|E

[...] Before the 2011–12 season, he relented, [...] "... if the shoe was on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot</b> and I was a fan, and I was very passionate about one player, and he decided to leave, I would be upset too about the way he handled it." ...|$|E
500|$|The completeness, preservation, and {{scientific}} {{importance of this}} skeleton gave [...] "Big Al" [...] its name; the individual itself was below the average size for Allosaurus fragilis, and was a subadult estimated at only 87%grown. The specimen was described by Breithaupt in 1996. Nineteen of its bones were broken or showed signs of infection, which {{may have contributed to}} [...] "Big Al's" [...] death. Pathologic bones included five ribs, five vertebrae, and four bones of the feet; several damaged bones showed osteomyelitis, a bone infection. A particular problem for the living animal was infection and trauma to the right foot that probably affected movement and may have also predisposed <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot</b> to injury because of a change in gait. Al had an infection on the first phalanx on the third toe that was afflicted by an involucrum. The infection was long lived, perhaps up to 6 months. Big Al Two is also known to have multiple injuries.|$|E
500|$|The Mission Mountain Wood Band {{broke up}} in 1981 and members Quist, Robinson, and Kurt Bergeron (who had {{replaced}} Johnson), formed Montana, {{also known as}} The Montana Band. They added members Mark Wittman and Jerry Zalnoski, and headquartered in Reno, Nevada. In this formation, they played concerts at various colleges, nightclubs, fairs and rodeos as well as frequent performances in the Lake Tahoe area. The appeared on the ABC Cheryl Ladd Special and in other venues, recorded one album, Change in the Weather, in 1981, and were {{best known for the}} song, [...] "Shoe's on <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Foot</b> Tonight," [...] written by Quist. [...] The single was listed as [...] "recommended" [...] by Billboard on October 31, 1981. [...] The album was produced by Randy Bean and released by Waterhouse Records. In December 1981, Billboard Magazine listed it as a recommended LP, and said of the band, [...] "They seem well-adapted to today's modern country sound." [...] The band personnel remained in flux, with new musicians joining the band as others left. New musicians added to the band's lineup included Grady Whitfield of Utah, Alan Larson and Cliff Tipton, both from Oklahoma.|$|E

In response, low-lying areas in the Humber River valley were converted to parkland and property zoning standards were changed across Ontario to avoid building encroachment on floodplains. There is a memorial in {{the south end of}} Lions Park near a pedestrian bridge which incorporates the original footing of a bridge that once crossed <b>the</b> Humber. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>footing</b> of <b>the</b> bridge is the square chunk of concrete that {{is in the middle of}} the river nearby.|$|R

2500|$|A true {{direction}} change involving the feet {{moving in a}} new direction requires either a prep step or a pivot, both of which are sometimes referred to as a flank. To perform a prep step, on the last count of movement in the first direction a marcher plants the foot with the heel turned outward at half the angle of the turn desired, with the upper body still facing forward. On the next count, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot</b> snaps into position completing the turn. The upper body may or may not turn with the lower body. Some bands plant the heel on the prep step rather than the toe, but preserving the angle of the foot. [...] To perform a pivot, the marcher pivots between directions over the ball of the foot on the last count instead of using a prep step.|$|E
2500|$|A dancer may {{transition}} to en pointe {{by any of}} three possible methods: relevé, sauté or piqué. In the relevé method, the dancer rises smoothly by rotating the foot downward until it reaches a fully extended, vertical orientation, while the toe box remains {{in contact with the}} floor, thus [...] "rolling up" [...] on the foot. This may be done either gradually or rapidly, on one foot or both feet, beginning with {{feet flat on the floor}} or in demi-pointe (heels raised). In the sauté method, the dancer springs up and lands en pointe. In the process, the feet break contact with the floor and the dancer is briefly airborne. To {{transition to}} en pointe via piqué, a dancer will step out directly onto a fully extended, vertical foot. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot</b> is then raised from the floor, thereby leaving the dancer en pointe.|$|E

60|$|It took Tom two {{or three}} minutes to reason this out to himself, but at last he {{understood}} the drift of what his companion said.

2500|$|If {{there is}} a single {{criticism}} to be made of Gardner ... it is that he accepts too comfortably the conventional wisdom, or accepted social reality, of current twentieth-century science and middle-class American Christianity. Somehow it is evident (to me at least) that he is implicitly making a pact with the reader to evaluate these fringe groups in terms of their own shared presumptions about what is [...] "normal". Thus he is quite confident throwing around labels like [...] "quack", [...] "crank" [...] and [...] "preposterous". In science the use of such value judgments can be quite time-bound; likewise in religions where today's heresy may become tomorrow's orthodoxy. The odds of course are always {{on the side of the}} writer criticizing fringe groups because statistically speaking so few of them survive. However, when a group does weather its infancy and go on to prosper, invariably its original detractors look a bit more arbitrary than they did initially, and then the shoe is on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>foot.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{pursuit of}} beauty has driven Hofstadter {{both inside and}} outside his {{professional}} work.

[...] He has had several exhibitions of his artworks in various university art galleries. These shows have featured large collections of his gridfonts, his ambigrams (pieces of calligraphy created with two readings, either of which is usually obtained from the other by rotating or reflecting the ambigram, but sometimes simply by [...] "oscillation", like the Necker Cube or the rabbit/duck figure of Joseph Jastrow), and his [...] "Whirly Art" [...] (music-inspired visual patterns realized using shapes based on various alphabets from India).

2500|$|The {{following}} section, specifically {{where it}} concerns Fernand Legros, who {{is depicted as}} the villain of the piece, should be considered {{with a certain amount}} of critical skepticism as regards its bias to De Hory, as it differs intrinsically from the account given to Roger Peyrefitte by Legros himself in Peyrfitte's very complete Legros biography [...] "Tableaux de Chasse". Here De Hory appears as an aggressive and persistent con man, who suckers Legros into the belief that he is a needy impoverished aristocrat deserving of Legros charity, whereas in reality he is a person wanted by Interpol under a multitude of different aliases and convicted of a variety of crimes, forgery and fraud not being the least of them. [...] Evidently the self-serving tales that find their way into the following narrative, woven by [...] "Elmyr de Hory, Elmer Hoffman, Elementer alias Hofman, baron de Hory, Haury, Hury or Hurry, Hory, baron Raynal, Raynor, Raynol or Rainol, comte de Herzog, baron de Boughady, von Bonhyday, Boundjy, Elmyr Lazlo, Dauray, Dory, Boutin, Dory-Boutin, Cassou Robert or Cassou Charles, Louis Curiel or Curiel Charles, born in Budapest (Hungary) 14 April 1905, the date often jiggered forward to 1914 to appear younger, object of pursuits, convictions and expulsions from France, Switzerland, Italy, Federal Germany, Great Britain, from Mexico, from the United States, from Canada, for false check writing without funds, check forgery, forgery carrying a false name, theft, receiver and purveyor of stolen goods, and embezzlement" [...] should be taken with more than a large pinch of salt.
