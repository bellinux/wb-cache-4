500|$|Pretty on the Inside was {{received}} with positive acclaim by many British and American alternative press. In a review by NME, {{the album was}} positively compared to Patti Smith's Horses, {{as well as the}} debut albums of the Ramones, Television, and New York Dolls, [...] and was branded as being in [...] "a class of its own", while Elizabeth Wurtzel wrote in The New Yorker that [...] "Pretty on the Inside is such a cacophony... very few people are likely <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> once, let alone give it the repeated listenings it needs for you to discover that it's probably the most compelling album to have been released in 1991." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title and}} opening track, [...] "Dance Again", {{was written by}} RedOne, Enrique Iglesias, Bilal [...] "The Chef", AJ Junior and Pitbull, who is also {{featured}} in the song. After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come to her at the [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>it.</b> I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Mass Effect 2 was {{primarily}} developed at BioWare's Edmonton studio, {{a new team}} of 30 people was set to work at EA Montreal in March 2009 to supplement the teams already working on the game. The new team was composed {{of a number of}} people who worked on the original game, but the majority was new hires. Overall, Mass Effect 2 was developed over the course of roughly two years and more than 150 people worked on the game. Hudson mentioned two significant challenges that interfered with the development: the 2008–2012 global recession limited the game's budget, and the team had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> without impacting their ambitious goals. Additionally, due to the 2009 flu pandemic, a significant part of the team was ill during the last months of development, resulting in a loss of a man-year of time. Despite these factors, Hudson described the development of Mass Effect 2 as successful [...] "on time, on budget, and exceeding quality goals." ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} album with the Chicago Sun-Times, Fiasco has stated: [...] "Lasers {{is a great}} album. I'm {{actually}} happy with the record. I feel I got to say what I wanted even with -- It doesn't make up for what it took <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>it.</b> It's still being argued and debated upon. ... The climate of this record was very weird, in some instances surreal. I became very abstract. I had to create this commercial art that appeases the corporate side. I had to acquiesce to certain forces. Hopefully within that I snuck in some things I actually wanted to say any way I can." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, Fiasco has expressed that during the recording process of the album he has dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts: [...] "It was mentally destructive. I say it with a certain laissez-faire now because I'm past it [...] I was super-depressed, lightly suicidal, at moments medium suicidal – and if not suicidal, willing to just {{walk away from it}} all completely." ...|$|E

2500|$|I think Walter is {{a writer}} at heart. Writers aren't always that good at {{communicating}} in person. He's also a tough son-of-a-bitch. He's like a cowboy. His director's chair was made out of leather and {{on the back of}} it read [...] "Lone Wolf". [...] He used to frequent gun clubs and he wasn't a very delicate guy.... We were doing a love scene. When they said, [...] "We need to ADR the love scene." [...] I really freaked out. I had never done a love scene before... I really needed help <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>it.</b> I panicked, and the Producer... Joel Silver, called Walter and somehow persuaded him to come over and direct me through the ADR. Streets of Fire was a big picture for me, and I was overwhelmed. I think that bothered Walter. I think he thought that I was a needy guy. He was used to working with actors who had experience like Nick Nolte or David Carradine. I've always wondered why Walter has never wanted to work with me again. I think he was too much of gentlemen to tell me that I was too needy at the time.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998 Lionel {{was shocked}} to {{discover}} he had fathered a son, 16-year-old Luke Billingham (Greg Freeman) when he himself was 16. Luke debuted as a [...] "shy, inarticulate country boy with an adventurous spirit" [...] who shockingly revealed to Lionel that he was his son. Though Lionel was in shock, he took Luke in, Leigh stated, [...] "Lionel’s struggling <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>through</b> <b>it</b> as fatherhood is thrust upon him. He just inherited a 16-year-old son unlike most people who get to watch their kids from a baby and slowly get used to them." [...] The storyline proved to be hugely topical, {{with the amount of}} single parent families in the nineties was at an all-time high. Luke instantly got into trouble in his new home, he was involved in a robbery at Lionel's bar, drove Lionel's car without a driver's license and stole a credit card to access online pornography. Despite this, Leigh insisted Lionel was the best possible father, [...] "Lionel’s the best father. He talks through the troubles." [...] After initially struggling to connect with Luke, when he was involved in a dramatic bus crash Lionel realised how much he loved his son and even went to the extent of cooking him gourmet school lunches. After only knowing each other a year, the father-son partnership was broken after Lionel died in scenes that Freeman described as, [...] "draining". Luke soon became a father with his teenage bride, Josie Bergman (Karamia Muller) at age 16, similarly to his father Lionel.|$|E
