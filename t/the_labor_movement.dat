5|$|During the 1920s, the ACLU's {{primary focus}} was on freedom of speech in general, and speech within <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>movement</b> particularly. Because most of the ACLU's efforts were {{associated}} with <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>movement,</b> the ACLU itself came under heavy attack from conservative groups, such as the American Legion, the National Civic Federation, and Industrial Defense Association and the Allied Patriotic Societies.|$|E

5|$|Eugene Debs helped {{motivate the}} American Left {{as a measure}} of {{political}} opposition to corporations and World War I. American socialists, communists, and anarchists honor his compassion for <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>movement</b> and motivation to have the average working man build socialism without large state involvement. Several books have been written about his life as an inspirational American socialist.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, under Meany's leadership, the International Longshoremen's Association, {{accused of}} racketeering, was {{expelled}} from the AFL, an early example of Meany's efforts against corruption {{and the influence of}} organized crime in <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>movement.</b> After bitter internal reform, the union was readmitted to the now-merged AFL-CIO, in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Besides their {{obligations}} as obedient, peaceful and nonpolitical {{inhabitants of the}} Grand Duchy, who had a few decades earlier accepted the class system as {{the natural order of}} their life, the commoners began to ask for and demand their civil rights and citizenship in Finnish society. The power struggle between the Finnish estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>movement.</b> On the other side, due to at least a century-long tradition and experience of administrative leadership, the Finnish elite saw itself as the inherent natural power.|$|E
5|$|In the October 1917 elections, the Social Democrats {{lost their}} {{absolute}} majority, which radicalized <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>movement</b> and decreased support for moderate politics. The crisis of July 1917 {{did not bring}} about the Red Revolution in January 1918 on their own, but together with political development based on the commoners' interpretation of the ideas of Fennomania and socialism, the events were decisive for the goals of a Finnish revolution. In order to win power, the socialists had to overcome the Parliament.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Labor</b> Forward <b>movement</b> was an {{organizing}} {{program of}} the American Federation of Labor from roughly 1910 to 1920.

5|$|In 1901, the Democratic-dominated state {{legislature}} {{passed a bill}} requiring payment of a poll tax for voting, which effectively disenfranchised most blacks, and many poor whites and Latinos. In addition, the legislature established white primaries, ensuring that minorities {{were excluded from the}} formal political process. The number of voters dropped dramatically, and the Democrats crushed competition from the Republican and Populist parties. The Socialist Party became the second largest party in Texas after 1912, coinciding with a large socialist upsurge in the United States during fierce battles in <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>movement</b> and the popularity of national heroes like Eugene V. Debs. The Socialists' popularity soon waned after their vilification by the United States government for their opposition to US involvement in World War I.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish labor movement, {{which emerged}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century from temperance, {{religious}} movements and Fennomania, had a Finnish nationalist, working-class character. From 1899–1906 the movement became conclusively independent, shedding the patronizing thinking of the Fennoman estates, and it was represented by the Finnish Social Democratic Party, established in 1899. Workers' activism directed both toward opposing Russification and in developing a domestic policy that tackled social problems and responded to the demand for democracy. This was a reaction to the domestic dispute, ongoing since the 1880s, between the Finnish nobility-burghers and <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>movement</b> concerning voting rights for the common people.|$|E
5|$|The {{revolution}} in 1944 left {{many of the}} biggest opponents of organized labor unaffected, such as the landed elite and the United Fruit Company. The revolution, and election of Arévalo, nonetheless marked a significant shift in the fortunes of labor unions. The protests of 1944 strengthened <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>movement</b> {{to the point where}} Ponce Vaides stopped enforcing the repressive vagrancy law, which was abolished in the 1945 constitution. On 1 May 1945, Arévalo made a speech celebrating organized labor, to a tremendously positive reception. The freedom of press guaranteed in the new constitution also drew much attention to the brutal working conditions in Guatemala City. From the beginning, the new unions that were formed fell into two camps, those that were communist and those that were not. The repressive policies of the Ubico government had driven both factions underground, but they re-emerged after the revolution.|$|E

5|$|Ubico {{had made}} {{statements}} supporting <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>movement</b> when campaigning for the presidency, but after his election his policy quickly became authoritarian. He abolished {{the system of}} debt peonage, {{and replaced it with}} a vagrancy law, which required all men of working age who did not own land to perform a minimum of 100 days of hard labor. In addition, the state made use of unpaid Indian labor to work on public infrastructure like roads and railroads. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property, an action described by historians as legalizing murder. He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it {{into one of the most}} efficient and ruthless in Latin America. The police were given greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. The result of these laws was to create tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers. Ubico was highly contemptuous of the country's indigenous people, once stating that they resembled donkeys.|$|E
5|$|William D. Haywood {{was born}} in 1869 in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. His father, a former Pony Express rider, died of {{pneumonia}} when Haywood was three years old. His maternal grandfather was an Afrikaner born in the Orange Free State in 1820. At age nine, he injured his right eye while whittling a slingshot with a knife, permanently blinding his right eye. Haywood never had his damaged eye replaced with a glass eye; when photographed, he would turn his head to show his left profile. That same year, he began working in the mines, never having received much formal education. After brief stints as a cowboy and a homesteader, he returned to mining in 1896. High-profile {{events such as the}} gradual demise of the Molly Maguires, the Haymarket Massacre in 1886 and the Pullman Strike in 1894 fostered Haywood's interest in <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{the rights}} {{guaranteed}} by the 1940 Constitution, anarchists could once again organize themselves with less risk of death or deportation. The SIA and the Federacíon de Grupos Anarquistas de Cuba dissolved themselves, their thousands of members forming the Asociacíon Libertaria de Cuba (Cuban Libertarian Association). The ALC held the Primer Congreso Nacional Libertario (First National Libertarian Congress) in 1944, electing a Secretary General, and an Organizational Secretary. This was followed in 1948 by a second congress, which featured the German anarchist Augustin Souchy delivering the opening address. Also, an official propaganda organ for the ALC was chosen, Solideridad Gastronómica, which was published monthly up until it was shut down by the Castro government in December 1960. A third congress was held in 1950, with a heavy focus on keeping <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>movement</b> apolitical and free of interference from politicians and bureaucrats. By the mid-1950s, Fulgencio Batista was once again in power after a successful coup d'état. Many anarchists joined guerrilla groups fighting the Batista government, including that of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement, which led to Batista's fleeing Cuba {{on the last day}} of 1958.|$|E
