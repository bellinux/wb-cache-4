5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> {{attacked}} the church, damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and fired at the church, after which <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> further. <b>The</b> <b>mob</b> forced {{its way into the}} church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves to guard St. Philip Neri's, and <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> left the church.|$|E
5|$|After Shirley had {{returned}} home that afternoon, <b>the</b> <b>mob,</b> which had seized another naval officer and several petty officers, {{returned to his}} house. Shirley ordered a number of armed men who were protecting his house to fire at <b>the</b> <b>mob,</b> but William Pepperrell was able to stop Shirley's men from firing and to persuade <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> to leave. In the meantime, Commodore Knowles threatened to bombard Boston with his squadron. It was only after the Massachusetts Council adopted resolutions {{in support of the}} demands of <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> that the situation became quieter in Boston. <b>The</b> <b>mob</b> eventually released its hostages and Knowles released the impressed seamen.|$|E
5|$|After lynching Sam Carter, <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> met Sylvester Carrier—Aaron's {{cousin and}} Sarah's son—on a road {{and told him}} to get out of town. Carrier refused, and when <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> moved on, he {{suggested}} gathering {{as many people as possible}} for protection.|$|E

5|$|One {{high-profile}} {{case that}} illustrated Bradley's opposition to racial violence {{was that of}} ex-slave George Dinning. After being emancipated, Dinning saved enough money to purchase a farm in Simpson County. On January 27, 1897, a mob of 25armed white men came to Dinning's farm, accused him of stealing hogs and chickens, and demanded he leave the county within 10days. Dinning denied being a thief and insisted several people in the county would vouch for his good character. <b>The</b> <b>mob,</b> enraged by Dinning's resistance, began firing on his house and wounded him twice. Dinning retrieved a gun from his house and fired into <b>the</b> <b>mob,</b> killing one man. <b>The</b> <b>mob</b> fled, and the next day, Dinning turned himself in to local officials. While he was in their custody, <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> returned to his farm, drove his family from their house, looted it, and razed it to the ground.|$|E
5|$|The Bull's Head {{hotel on}} 44th Street, which refused to provide alcohol to <b>the</b> <b>mob,</b> was burned. The mayor's {{residence}} on Fifth Avenue, the Eighth and Fifth District police stations, and other buildings were attacked and set on fire. Other targets included {{the office of}} the New York Times. <b>The</b> <b>mob</b> was turned back at the Times office by staff manning Gatling guns, including Times founder Henry Jarvis Raymond. Fire engine companies responded, but some firefighters were sympathetic to the rioters because they had also been drafted on Saturday. Later in the afternoon, authorities shot and killed a man as a crowd attacked the armory at Second Avenue and 21st Street. <b>The</b> <b>mob</b> broke all the windows with paving stones ripped from the street. <b>The</b> <b>mob</b> beat, tortured and/or killed numerous black people, including one man who was attacked by a crowd of 400 with clubs and paving stones, then lynched, hanged from a tree and set alight.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years later}} Commodore Charles Knowles, {{who served as}} Governor of Louisbourg after its capture, had {{a large number of}} seamen from Boston harbour {{impressed}} for service in his squadron. A mob of more than 300 men seized three naval officers and a deputy sheriff and beat the sheriff. <b>The</b> <b>mob</b> then went to Governor Shirley's house, demanding the release of the men impressed by Knowles. Shirley tried to call out the militia, but they did not respond. Shirley did succeed in getting the naval officers into his house, and <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> eventually left. Later in the day Shirley went to the Town House to meet the people. <b>The</b> <b>mob,</b> now consisting of several thousand people, attacked the Town House, breaking many windows in the building. Shirley spoke to <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> and promised to present their demands to Commodore Knowles. <b>The</b> <b>mob</b> left, intending to find a Royal Navy ship to burn.|$|E

5|$|By the evening, a {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} arrived with orders to clear the streets, only to be stoned in the process. After a captain was attacked, the order was given to fire on <b>the</b> <b>mob,</b> which resulted in seven fatalities and nine injuries. Not long after, people with muskets and cannons arrived, and fierce fighting broke out between the soldiers and <b>the</b> <b>mob.</b> The fighting lasted for several hours, with the soldiers being fired upon from alleyways and the windows of nearby buildings. The soldiers brought in two cannons of their own and fired on the mob; <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> returned fire using their own cannons, armed with items such as nails, chains, knives and broken bottles. In an attempt to capture the mob's cannons, soldiers charged one cannon's position, only to be knocked off their horses by a rope tied across the street. The cannons were all eventually captured, and by early morning on July 8, the fighting had ended.|$|E

5|$|It was {{alleged that}} the police helped <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> against the Muslim {{community}} {{on the day of}} massacre. Evidence included complaints filed by victims' family members which state that police officials fired bullets and helped <b>the</b> <b>mob,</b> resulting in the killings. It was also alleged that police guided <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> of rioters to residents' hiding places. According to Human Rights Watch, the police did nothing as houses and people were burnt and, {{on the day of the}} violence, did not respond to telephone calls until the massacre ended. Numerous eyewitnesses saw police aiming tear gas shells at, and firing upon, Muslim youths who tried to defend themselves or others. There also have been allegations that police themselves burnt houses and looted. In the violence, the extensive use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was reported, which was cited as evidence of the involvement of officials because of easy access to it.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year on May 13, during the {{restoration}} process, a nationwide riot broke out.

When <b>the</b> <b>mobs</b> followed them, about 80 workmen who were still employed for the building's restoration chased them away.|$|R

5|$|Richard I was crowned King in 1189 and {{announced}} {{his intention to}} join the Crusades; this inflamed anti-Jewish sentiment. Rumours began to spread that the king had ordered that the English Jews be attacked. In York, tensions broke out into violence the following year. Richard de Malbis, who owed money to the powerful Jewish merchant Aaron of Lincoln, exploited an accidental house fire to incite a local mob to attack the home and family of a recently deceased Jewish employee of Aaron in York. Josce of York, {{the leader of the}} Jewish community, led the local Jewish families into the royal castle, where they took refuge in the wooden keep. <b>The</b> <b>mob</b> surrounded the castle, and when the constable left the castle to discuss the situation, the Jews, fearing the entry of <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> or being handed over to the sheriff, refused to allow him back in. The constable appealed to the sheriff, who called out his own men and laid siege to the keep. The siege continued until 16 March when the Jews' position became untenable. Their religious leader, Rabbi Yomtob, proposed an act of collective suicide to avoid being killed by <b>the</b> <b>mob,</b> and the castle was set on fire to prevent their bodies being mutilated after their deaths. Several Jews perished in the flames but the majority took their own lives rather than give themselves up to <b>the</b> <b>mob.</b> A few Jews did surrender, promising to convert to Christianity, but they were killed by the angry crowd. Around 150 Jews died in total in the massacre. The keep was rebuilt, again in wood, on the motte, which was raised in height by 13 feet (4 metres) at a cost of £207.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} anxious departure, five buses {{containing}} crowds of ravenous tourist anchovies {{stop at the}} Krusty Krab, its abundance of passengers furiously demanding meals. Unable to satisfy the anchovies' hunger and alarmed by <b>the</b> <b>mob,</b> Squidward and Mr. Krabs are left to helplessly deal with the unsatisfied crowd. Before long, SpongeBob returns from his errand, having fulfilled the request of Mr. Krabs and found a mechanical spatula, which he uses in speedily whipping up bundles of Krabby Patties for the anchovies and satisfying their hunger. After <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> subsides, SpongeBob is welcomed as a Krusty Krab employee, much to Squidward's dismay. After Mr. Krabs leaves, Patrick orders a Krabby Patty and is hurled from the establishment upon a mostly-unseen, and audibly manic, reprise of SpongeBob's cooking feat.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>mob</b> lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against <b>the</b> <b>mob</b> or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E

40|$|The {{border between}} common and vexation matter of person {{behaviour}} we {{are accustomed to}} is very slight. The topic of my diploma paper "Vexation at the workplace" becomes very actual and constantly the bigger problem in the contemporary modern society. Everyday mentally terror at the workplace, vexation among the colleagues, systematically made malignancies through which the superiors attack their inferiors (or vice-versa) {{is a problem that}} belongs serious incoveniences both to its victims and the company. My diploma paper is above all focused on the sophisticated and malicious area of work-vexation that is called <b>the</b> <b>mobbing.</b> Marginally I mention other forms of vexation and the bossing. I made my exploration at the public service environment as the work-vexation is usually put together with it. Primarily I point the legal and moral side of <b>the</b> <b>mobbing</b> and its psychological and social aspects. Secondarily I mark <b>the</b> <b>mobbing</b> as a job-psychological phenomenon, its influence to the company itself and consequences between it and some modern society trends (teamwork, power, burn-out syndrome, internet technologies). Supposing to become the managers we should make effort to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>mobbing.</b> As only <b>the</b> workplace without the vexation brings the satisfaction that can results in higher level of the work productivity, economic profit and the the incapacity of work decreasement. Thereby <b>the</b> <b>mobbing</b> affects <b>the</b> whole life of its victim and also that anyone of us can become the victim it is necessary to solve this problem urgently and constantly...|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mobs</b> were {{determined}} to get others to stop working; if their demands were not met, destruction of property usually followed. So, on some occasions, even the bosses ordered their workers to stop work {{in order to prevent}} damage to their businesses. <b>The</b> <b>mobs</b> successfully stopped many kinds of work, such as iron works, boiler works, iron, nail, and moulding companies, and die and machine works. The mayor of the city issued many warnings for <b>the</b> <b>mobs</b> to disperse and to obey the law. He even pleaded for neighborhoods to try and stop the looting by forming militias of their own and ordered the closure of liquor saloons. His methods proved incapable of putting an end to the upheaval, and as a result he turned to use of force.|$|R
