From the analysis, the BPRS Bhakti Haji Malang in assessing the financing using the principles that apply to banking institutions that is the principle of 5 C. in the existing system murabahah in BPRS Bhakti Haji Malang was not wearing a down payment or do not acknowledge the advances (urbun). BPRS Bhakti Haji Malang murabahah serve only by order only, due to limited places so that no murabahah without orders. Due to limited manpower and space, so when murabahah agreed, the BPRS Bhakti Haji Malang give power of attorney to clients to be given the mandate by the SRB to purchase the items required. In this case the SRB pay the customer a number that is needed by customers to purchase these items. Overall, the accounting treatment of BPRS Bhakti Haji Malang start of activity measurement, recognition, recording and presenting the financial statements are in accordance with existing provisions of SFAS No. 59 although there are still some matters that are not in accordance with SFAS No. 59.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the markets for intermediate (industrial) <b>products.</b> <b>Transactions</b> <b>in</b> these markets are usually made through both long term contracts and spot contracts. The models currently {{available in the}} 2 ̆ 2 economics of contracts 2 ̆ 2 literature are of limited interest {{for the study of}} the <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> intermediate <b>product</b> markets. Special structural characteristics, present in many of these markets, requires building models that can represent them with more fidelity. We have built three models that try to capture the special structural characteristics of intermediate product markets. ^ However, this thesis has other theoretical contributions. In the current literature of 2 ̆ 2 economics of information 2 ̆ 2, attention has been concentrated on prices as the mechanism through which information is disseminated in the economy. But, we believe that quantities are important signals about the information present in the economy, and that agents use it intensively. This thesis focuses on quantity as the information transmission mechanism. ^ This thesis also studies markets where equilibrium prices are not reached by an auctioneer-like process of price formation. Instead, prices are announced unilaterally by one of the parts of a transaction (the seller), and the other part (the buyer) has discretion over the quantity transacted at the announced price. ^ Another contribution of this thesis is that it approaches the contracting problem from a new point of view. A typical paper on contracts starts with the description of some market structure and tries to find the 2 ̆ 2 optimum 2 ̆ 2 (in some sense) contract for that structure. We, instead, starting with observed real world contracts, investigate which structural characteristics of a market would give rise to real world contracts as a reasonable outcome. ...|$|R
5000|$|Analysis of {{the global}} {{production}} networks relies {{on the use of}} the input-output tables that links firms through the <b>transactions</b> involved <b>in</b> the <b>product</b> creation. Commodity chain literature considers firms as the nodes in a number of chains that transform inputs into outputs through a series of interconnected stages of production, later linked to distribution and consumption activities. Andersen and Christensen define five major types of connective nodes in supply networks: Local integrator, Export base, Import base, International spanner and Global integrator [...] Hobday et al. argue that the core capability of the firms stem from their ability to manage network of components and subsystem suppliers.To capture both vertical and horizontal links across the sequence of production process, Lazzarini introduced the concept of Netchain: [...] "a set of networks [...] horizontal ties between firms within a particular industry or group, which are sequentially arranged based on vertical ties between firms in different layers ... Netchain analysis explicitly differentiates between horizontal (<b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> the same layer) and vertical ties (transactions between layers), mapping how agents in each layer are related to each other and to agents in other layers". Critical studies have explored production networks in the domain of ethics of production, for instance focusing on local effects or labor relations.|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{literature}} in macroeconomics {{is concerned with the}} effects of monetary disturbances on the real economy, particularly the role of money in business cycles. Monetary shocks can have important real effects in “Keynesian ” models because this class of models generally involves nominal rigidities in prices or wages. In sharp contrast, a broad neoclassical tradition in macroeconomics (including real business cycle theory) typically assumes prices are completely flexible, although there have been some recent attempts to combine these traditions, as in Kydland (1987), Cho and Cooley (1990), and King (1990). While there is much evidence that certain types of goods have sticky nominal prices, there is also evidence of frequent price changes for other types of goods, such as the relatively homogeneous commodities sold on near-auction markets, food, automobiles (transactions prices), and computers. Typically, Keynesian macroeconomic studies postulate a sticky price level, so that a change in the nominal money supply is (in the short run) a change in the real money supply. These studies generalize from the evidence that some prices are sticky to the hypothesis that the general price level is sticky. In contrast, neoclassical studies often assume flexible prices, so that the price level adjusts immediately to changes in the nominal money supply.

40|$|Reducing costs, {{increasing}} {{speed and}} leveraging {{the intelligence of}} partners involved during product design processes are important benefits of Internet-enabled collaborative product design and realization environments. The options for cost-effective product design, re-design or improvement are at their peak {{during the early stages}} of the design process and designers can collaborate with suppliers, manufacturers and other relevant contributors to acquire a better understanding of associated costs and product viability. Collaboration is by no means a new paradigm. However, companies have found distrust of collaborative partners to be the most intractable obstacle to collaborative commerce and Internet-enabled business especially in intellectual property environments, which handle propriety data on a constant basis. This problem is also reinforced in collaborative environments that are distributed in nature. Thus trust is the main driver or enabler of successful collaborative efforts or <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> Internet-enabled <b>product</b> design environments. Focus is on analyzing the problem of ¡®trust for services¡¯ in distributed collaborative service provider assessment and selection, concentrating on characteristics specific to electronic product design (e-Design) environments. Current tools for such collaborative partner/provider assessment are inadequate or non-existent and researching network, user, communication and service trust problems, which hinder the growth and acceptance of true collaboration <b>in</b> <b>product</b> design, can foster new frontiers in manufacturing, business and technology. Trust and its associated issues within the context of a secure Internet-enabled product design & realization platform is a multifaceted and complex problem, which demands a strategic approach crossing disciplinary boundaries. A Design Environment Trust Service (DETS) framework is proposed to incorporate trust for services <b>in</b> <b>product</b> design environments based on client specified (or default) criteria. This involves the analysis of validated network (objective) data and non-network (subjective) data and the use of Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodology for the selection of the most efficient service provision alternative through the minimization of distance from a specified ideal point and interpreted as a Dynamic (Design) Trust Index (DTI) or rank.

The contribution of this research report is to propose explicitly for the first time, in addition to conventional market based policy measures proposed so far, the more instructive and mandate measures such as encouraging firms and sellers to quote price and make payment in KHR, requiring financial institutions to increase operations in KHR, making fiscal measures in KHR, and requiring assistance with the expenditures of donors and NGO projects in KHR, etc., which are useful for restricting the network externality of dollar based payments.

40|$|In {{industries}} {{with quick}} innovation cycles and switching costs, vendor profitability is often {{driven by the}} ability to “lock in ” customers. Despite a large theoretical literature, there are few empirical studies {{on the success of}} vendor pricing and product strategies to achieve lock-in. This paper uses a comprehensive database of <b>transactions</b> <b>in</b> two major <b>product</b> lines for a large enterprise software vendor to examine the use and success of pricing and product strategies. Regarding pricing, the paper demonstrates that the vendor engages in significant “bargain-then-ripoff” pricing; customers completely new to it receive discounts that are nearly 50 % greater than existing customers who are purchasing upgrades of a product. On the product side, one common lock-in strategy – the offering of broad product “suites ” which span multiple product lines – appears to be of limited effectiveness. The vendor cannot limit its initial “bargain” to customers new to a product line, even if the customer has bought a different product the vendor previously. This suggests that lock-in is product-, not vendor-specific. Finally, not all customers get locked-in; I find that customers with high IT capabilities, and/or those with strong financial performance (which are very highly correlated), are likely to receive an “initial bargain ” and then switch suppliers or use legacy systems, rather than pay locked-in rates. The “best ” customers in terms of future revenue potential therefore avoid getting locked-in. ...|$|R
