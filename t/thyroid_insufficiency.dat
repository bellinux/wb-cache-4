40|$|Background: Iodine {{requirements}} are increased during pregnancy to maintain maternal and fetal euthyroidism. There have been recent improvements in iodized salt coverage in India, but whether iodized salt {{is sufficient to}} sustain iodine requirements during pregnancy remains uncertain. Our aims were to measure thyroid status in first trimester pregnant women in southern India and assess potential determinants of thyroid function, including iodine status, thyroid autoimmunity, dietary patterns, body weight, and anemia. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study among 334 pregnant women of = 14 weeks' gestation, in Bangalore, India. We measured anthropometrics, urinary iodine concentration (UIC), maternal thyroid volume (by ultrasound), and thyroid function. We applied a thyrotropin (TSH) upper limit of 2. 5 ¿mIU/L to classify <b>thyroid</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Using a questionnaire, we obtained sociodemographic and dietary data, obstetric history, and use of iodized salt and iodine supplements. Results: Among the women, the mean (standard deviation) gestational age was 10. 3 (2. 5) weeks, 67 % were nulliparous, 21 % were vegetarian, 19 % were anemic, and 23 % were overweight or obese. Iodized salt was used by 98 % of women, and they were iodine sufficient: median UIC (range) was 184. 2 ¿µg/L (8. 1 – 1152 ¿µg/L) and all had a normal thyroid volume. However, 18 % of the women had thyroid insufficiency: 3. 7 % had overt hypothyroidism (83 % with positive TPO-Ab), 9. 2 % had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 5. 2 % had hypothyroxinemia. Women consuming vegetarian diets did not have significantly lower iodine intakes or higher risk of hypothyroidism than those consuming mixed diets, but overweight/obesity and anemia predicted <b>thyroid</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Conclusion: In this urban population of southern India, pregnant women have adequate iodine status in the first trimester. Despite this, many have <b>thyroid</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> and the prevalence of overt hypothyroidism is more than fivefold higher than reported in other iodine sufficient populations of pregnant women...|$|E

40|$|Background. Diseases of {{the thyroid}} gland (TG) are ranked first among all {{endocrine}} pathologies and remain {{one of the}} most difficult problems. Objective: to evaluate the morphofunctional state of the TG in children with congenital hypothyroidism (CH). Materials and methods. The work is based on survey data of 34 children with CH: ultrasound examination of the TG, determination of thyroid hormone levels (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, thyroglobulin). Statistical analysis was performed by standard methods using the software package StatSoft Statistica 6. 0 for Microsoft Windows XP. Results. In 67. 6 % of cases, the diagnosis was established according to the screening for CH, in 32. 4 % — out of the screening. In 22 patients, thyroid tissue was not visualized in a typical location, or its total volume was significantly less than normal. In 12 patients, the TG was in typical place, and its volume meet norms or exceeds its upper limit. In 55. 6 % of patients, we have detected cysts (in 56 % — with dystopia of the TG, in 44 % of cases — with thyroid hypoplasia). They are located paratracheally: on the left — in 66. 7 %, on the right — in 13. 3 %, in 20 % — on both sides. It was found a significant degree of <b>thyroid</b> <b>insufficiency</b> in patients with thyroid defects, however, in thyroid hypoplasia, the TSH level was lower (p < 0. 05) compared with that of in dystopia.

40|$|Neurodevelopment {{is known}} to be {{particularly}} susceptible to <b>thyroid</b> hormone <b>insufficiency</b> and can result in extensive structural and functional deficits within the central nervous system (CNS), subsequently leading to the establishment of cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptomatology. The current study evaluated the effects of gestational and/or lactational maternal exposure to propylthiouracil (PTU) -induced hypothyroidism (as a suggestive multilevel experimental approach to the study of hypothyroidism-induced changes that has been developed and characterized by the authors) on crucial brain enzyme activities of 21 -day-old Wistar rat offspring in a CNS region-specific manner. The activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Na(+),K(+) -ATPase and Mg(2 +) -ATPase in the offspring hypothalamus, cerebellum and pons were assessed. The study demonstrated that maternal exposure to PTU (0. 05 % w/v in the drinking water) during the critical periods of neurodevelopment can result in an inhibition of hypothalamic, pontine and cerebellar Na(+),K(+) -ATPase; a major marker of neuronal excitability and metabolic energy production as well as an important regulator of important systems of neurotransmission. On the other hand, no significant changes in the activities of the herein offspring CNS regions' AChE and Mg(2 +) -ATPase were recorded. The observed Na(+),K(+) -ATPase inhibition: (i) is region-specific (and non-detectable in whole brain homogenetes), (ii) could constitute a central event in the pathophysiology of clinically-relevant hypothyroidism-associated developmental neurotoxicity, (iii) occurs under all examined experimental schemes, and (iv) certainly deserves further clarification at a molecular and histopathological level.

This experimental approach has been recently developed and characterized by the authors based on neurochemical analyses performed on newborn and 21 -day-old rat offspring whole brain homogenates; as a continuum to this effort, the current study focused on two CNS regions of major significance for cognitive development: the frontal cortex and the hippocampus. Maternal exposure to PTU in the drinking water during gestation and/or lactation resulted into changes in the activities of acetylcholinesterase and two important adenosinetriphosphatases (Na(+),K(+) - and Mg(2 +) -ATPase), that seemed to take place in a CNS-region-specific manner and that were dependent upon the PTU-exposure timeframe followed. As these findings are analyzed and compared to the available literature, they: (i) highlight the variability involved in the changes of the aforementioned enzymatic parameters in the studied CNS regions (attributed to both the different neuroanatomical composition and the thyroid-hormone-dependent neurodevelopmental growth/differentiation patterns of the latter), (ii) reveal important information with regards to the neurochemical mechanisms that could be involved in the way clinical hypothyroidism could affect optimal neurodevelopment and, ultimately, cognitive function, as well as (iii) underline the need for the adoption of more consistent approaches towards the experimental simulation of congenital and early-age-occurring hypothyroidism...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Asymptomatic {{pituitary}} abnormalities {{occur in}} about 10 % of cranial {{magnetic resonance imaging}} scans, but metastatic carcinoma of the pituitary gland is rare: 133 cases have been reported. Two thirds secreted either prolactin or adrenocorticotropic hormone, and another 24 % were non-secreting. CASE PRESENTATION: A 42 -year-old Caucasian man lived for 30 years after the diagnosis of a pituitary tumor whose clinical and biochemical features were those of acromegaly and hypogonadism. Radiotherapy, totaling 7300 rad, was administered to the sella over two courses. Growth hormone levels normalized, but he developed both <b>thyroid</b> and adrenal <b>insufficiency,</b> and replacement therapy was commenced. Fourteen years later, growth hormone levels again became elevated, and bromocriptine was commenced but led to side effects {{that could not be}} tolerated. An attempted surgical intervention failed, and octreotide and pergolide were used in succession. Twenty-seven years after the diagnosis, a mass from an excisional biopsy of below the angle of the mandible proved to be metastatic pituitary carcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for synaptophysin, growth hormone, and prolactin. One year later, an octreotide scan showed uptake at the sella, neck, and spleen. Our patient declined further active oncology treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic pituitary carcinoma associated with acromegaly is particularly rare.

Using the thenar muscle group as reference, 2 patients with chronic and severe hormonal deficiency, 3 patients with subacute hypothyroidism, and 8 patients with moderate <b>thyroid</b> <b>insufficiency</b> with isolated high blood TSH levels were studied at rest, during exercise, and during subsequent recovery. The patients were compared with 15 control subjects. Only 1 patient presented a clinical myopathy. The intracellular pH and the relative measurements of inorganic phosphate, phosphocreatine, phosphodiesters, and ATP were directly calculated from phosphorus spectra. Resting muscle showed a significant rise in the inorganic phosphate to ATP ratio. In working hypothyroid muscle, a more important decrease in phosphocreatine levels was noted in patients with chronic and subacute thyroid deficiency, while the intracellular pH fall was greater in all hypothyroid patients than in control subjects. The phosphocreatine recovery rate was lower in all deficient patients, reflecting a probable mitochondrial metabolism impairment.

40|$|Congenital {{hypothyroidism}} (CH), {{a pediatric}} endocrine condition {{that results in}} early <b>thyroid</b> hormone (TH) <b>insufficiency,</b> is associated with visuospatial dysfunction suggestive of selective dorsal visual stream impairment. However, the ventral visual stream has not been adequately investigated in this population and so the effect of early TH insufficiency on development of the two streams had not been clearly established. This thesis used a comprehensive set of neuropsychological and experimental tests to assess higher-order visual functions {{in children and adolescents}} with CH compared with typically developing individuals. The results show that while CH is associated with poorer performance on tasks tapping into dorsal stream functions such as judgment of line orientation, spatial localization, three-dimensional block and two-dimensional mental construction, judgment of object location, and mental rotation, performance on typical ventral stream tasks such as identity discrimination, including abstract shapes, faces, and buildings, is relatively unimpaired. Thus this thesis establishes that the dorsal visual stream is selectively vulnerable to TH insufficiency. In addition to the investigating the nature of the higher-order visual problems in CH, this thesis explores the mechanism underlying these problems and assesses whether they result from organizational effects by early TH or activational effects by current TH levels. The data support the organizational mechanism and suggest that prenatal TH insufficiency results in iii irreversible changes to the dorsal visual stream due to the timing of dorsal stream development, which occurs earlier than ventral stream development and is thus more vulnerable to insult. i...|$|R

In order to synthesize them, {{trace elements}} must be available in a correspond-ing chemical form and concentration (Underwood and Suttle, 1999). Biological functions of iodine are mediated chiefly by its impact on the <b>thyroid</b> gland. Its <b>insufficiency</b> is manifested by a development of goitre, abortions and stillbirths. It negatively affects offspring vital-ity, growth and development, adult animal health and production, and it also influences the immune system (Bires et al., 1996; Sargison et al., 1998; Slosarkova et al., 1999; Underwood and Suttle, 1999). However, other elements such as selenium, iron and zinc affect the thyroid gland metabolism and thus also the levels of thyroidal hormones in the organism (Zimmermann and Kohrle, 2002). Selenium affects the thyroid gland metabolism and its hormones both by deiodinases that regu-late the synthesis and degradation of the biologi-cally active thyroid gland hormone (T 3) and by selenoperoxidases that protect the thyroid gland from hydroperoxide produced during the synthe-sis of thyroid hormones (Hess and Zimmermann, 2004).

40|$|The {{following}} conclusions may {{be drawn}} from the experiments presented in this article. 1. Excessive meat diet develops hypertrophy of the thyroid gland. A definite hypertrophy of the parathyroid gland under the same conditions has not been established. A meat diet does not develop hypertrophy of the <b>thyroid</b> gland when <b>insufficiency</b> of the parathyroid gland exists at the same time, even if no clinical symptoms are present. Where a pronounced hypertrophy caused by a meat diet has already developed, the hypertrophy disappears and the gland assumes its ordinary appearance after extirpation of a sufficiently large number of parathyroid glands. 2. After parathyroidectomy no hypertrophy of the thyroid gland takes place. In chronic tetany the thyroid gland seems, on the contrary, to atrophy in spite of a meat diet. 3. After complete extirpation of the thyroid gland, the parathyroid gland does not change its structure, even in cases where the cachexia lasts for several years. Small remaining parts of the thyroid gland may through hypertrophy develop into compact tissue and thereby seemingly present some points of resemblance to the parathyroid gland. 4. When the parathyroid gland hypertrophies, as in some forms of chronic tetany, this hypertrophy is characterized by the development of large, transparent, sharply defined cells, with large nuclei rich in chromatin. 5. The parathyroid and thyroid glands are independent organs, each having specific functions. This, however, does not exclude the occurrence of a direct or indirect interaction in the functions of the two systems. 6. There is reason to believe that an insufficiency of the parathyroid gland checks to some extent the function of the thyroid gland. No proof of the existence of a vicarious cooperation between the two glands has been established...|$|R

The results of the study showed the mean urinary iodine level in the control group and the group of women with the Hashimoto’s thyroiditis was 120. 77 ± 59. 35 (median UIC was 128. 00 µg/L), and 98. 64 ± 62. 83 (median UIC was 95. 00 µg/L), respectively. Estimated daily iodine intake of 150 µg/day was achieved in five participants in the control group, and four participants in the group of women with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Estimated median iodine intake in the control group and Hashimoto’s group was 142. 22 and 105. 55, respectively, indicating mild iodine deficiency. There was no significant relationships found between iodine and selenium, and iodine and thyroid hormones in both groups. The results of the current study are in line with the results from larger studies carried out in New Zealand. Iodine intakes appear to have improved after the mandatory fortification of bread with iodised salt in 2009, although iodine deficiency is still a problem in New Zealand. Using an iodine fortified bread clearly made an impact on the overall iodine intake but not to the expected level. There was no association found between iodine and selenium, and iodine and thyroid hormones. Any possible interaction between selenium and iodine is still unclear...|$|R
40|$|The thyroid {{function}} {{of patients with}} three different types of organification defect was studied. All patients were characterized by a high thyroidal 131 I uptake and a positive perchlorate discharge. Patients with Pendred's syndrome who had goitre and congenital nerve deafness were mostly euthyroid with normal circulating thyroid hormone levels. Only {{two of them had}} compensated euthyroidism with elevated total T 3, high basal TSH and delayed return to basal value after TRH. The patients who were euthyroid with large goitres and normal hearing had elevated total T 3 and an exaggerated TSH response to TRH. The thyroid {{function of}} these two groups of patients contrasted with that of goitrous cretins, who were clinically hypothyroid with low circulating total T 4, increased T 3 and decreased rT 3 levels. The data suggest that in patients with intrathyroidal iodine deficiency secondary to organification defect, there is preferential T 3 production in an effort to maintain euthyroid state, and this is further substantiated in the case of gross <b>thyroid</b> <b>insufficiency</b> either by enhanced peripheral conversion of T 4 to T 3, or reduced metabolic clearance of T 3 and increased clearance of rT 3, resulting in elevated T 3 and decreased rT 3 levels. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Thirteen {{asymptomatic}} {{women with}} postpartum blood loss {{of at least}} 500 cc were evaluated for anterior pituitary endocrine function. Insulin tolerance tests and TRH stimulation tests were done and determinations made for serum growth hormone, cortisol, thyrotropin, and prolactin. There was no laboratory evidence of pituitary dysfunction in this group of 13 patients. Subclinical hypopituitarism in women with previous postpartum hemorrhage {{would appear to be}} uncommon. Spontaneous anterior pituitary insufficiency occurs most commonly in women who have hemorrhaged during the postpartum period (Sheehan's Syndrome) [1]. Sheehan's Syndrome becomes clinically apparent in the puerperium with failure of lactation followed by absent or scanty menses, loss of pubic and axillary hair, atrophy of breasts and-genitals, pallor, infertility, and signs of adrenal and <b>thyroid</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> However, Sheehan's Syndrome often emerges insidiously and may not fully develop for several years [2]. Patients with long-standing Sheehan's Syndrome are exposed to considerable risk especially during times of stress [3]. Since the onset of clinically apparent disease may be delayed for several years, there may be a number of apparently normal women who have experienced postpartum blood loss and who may have impaired pituitary function. With increasing refinements in the testing of pituitary function {{it might be possible to}} identify these women before they develop clinical hypopituitarism. Anterior pituitary function was evaluated in thirteen asymptomatic women who had postpartum hemorrhage...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXT: Thyroid hormone {{synthesis}} requires H(2) O(2) {{produced by}} dual oxidases (Duoxes) and thyroperoxidase (TPO). Defects {{in this system}} lead to congenital hypothyroidism. H(2) O(2) damage to the thyrocytes may be a cause of cancer. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of the study was}} to investigate whether Duox and TPO, the H(2) O(2) producer and consumer, might constitute a complex in the plasma membrane of human thyroid cells, thus maximizing efficiency and minimizing leakage and damage. DESIGN: The interaction between Duox and TPO was studied by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting of plasma membranes from incubated follicles prepared from freshly resected human thyroid tissue from patients undergoing thyroidectomy, and COS- 7 cells transiently transfected with the entire Duoxes or truncated [amino (NH 2) or carboxyl (COOH) terminal]. RESULTS: The following results were reached: 1) Duox and TPO from membranes are coprecipitated, 2) this association is up-regulated through the Gq-phospholipase C-Ca(2 +) -protein kinase C pathway and down-regulated through the Gs-cAMP-protein kinase A pathway, 3) H(2) O(2) increases the association of Duox 1 and Duox 2 to TPO in cells and in membranes, and 4) truncated NH(2) - or COOH-terminal Duox 1 and Duox 2 proteins show different binding abilities with TPO. CONCLUSION: Coimmunoprecipitations show that Duox and TPO locate closely in the plasma membranes of human thyrocytes, and this association can be modulated by H(2) O(2), optimizing working efficiency and minimizing H(2) O(2) spillage. This association could represent one part of a postulated pluriprotein complex involved in iodination. This suggests that defects in this association could impair thyroid hormone synthesis and lead to <b>thyroid</b> <b>insufficiency</b> and cell damage. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|This thesis re-evaluates {{the initial}} use of organ {{replacement}} therapy in Britain during the 1890 s {{with regard to}} the thyroid gland and the associated disease entity of myxoedema as paradigmatic examples. The scope of my argument, however, encompasses the period between the 1850 s and 1910 s, as it approaches this subject from three perspectives. Firstly, this thesis examines the difficult and multifaceted history of <b>thyroid</b> <b>insufficiency</b> disorders between 1850 and 1878, such as endemic cretinism and goitre. Secondly, the introduction of myxoedema as a distinct clinical entity between 1878 and 1888 is discussed. Finally, the professional debates surrounding the new therapeutic approach of organ replacement therapy and its clinical application and scientific assessment are analysed for the period from the 1890 s onward. By focussing on the notions of disease causation via key historical figures and their publications, I argue that there was a mutual influence between the conception of myxoedema and organ replacement therapy, and that neither one would otherwise have become acceptable by the standards of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century scientific medicine. The origins of the ensemble of the new concepts and practices that constitute myxoedema and the associated organ replacement therapy can thereby be situated within a specific timeframe and context. They did not simply arise from contemporary medical knowledge, nor were they the culmination of some long-held desire of the medical community, or solely the result of medical progress. Instead, the practice of organ replacement therapy, as well as the new disease entity of myxoedema, depended on a view of the human body that assumed the medical possibility and desirability of replacing an organ’s lost function. This view was part of the concept of organ replacement, which emerged in the specific context of an experiment-oriented style of university medicine that predominated {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries. Its emergence depended on contemporary clinical and scientific practices as well as on the institutional and epistemological context within which these practices were embedded. As this thesis demonstrates, various social, scientific, and technical conditions needed to concur before organ replacement therapy could become part of medical reality...|$|E
40|$|When phenoltetrachlorphthalein is {{injected}} intravenously, it is {{eliminated from the}} body in the bile through the activity of the hepatic epithelium. The feces may be collected after purgation and the phthalein extracted and estimated against a standard solution. The estimation of phthalein can be done with accuracy in a suitable colorimeter and the elimination in normal dogs is quite constant. Given a definite liver injury by means of poisons (chloroform, phosphorus), the amount of phthalein excreted will be diminished and the fall in output will be proportional to the amount of injury. With an acute fatal poisoning the curve may fall to zero. Under certain conditions of vascular interference the liver phthalein may show a decreased output; in passive congestion of the liver and with the Eck fistula the liver output may fall considerably below normal. Known disturbances of the liver function due to parenchymatous injury or vascular disturbances are indicated by a fall in the phthalein. excretion curve. Conversely it may be claimed that a drop in phthalein excretion may indicate a decrease in the functional capacity of the liver even if there be no detectable histological changes. Adrenal insufficiency produced by extirpation of three fourths or more of the gland tissue will be associated with a drop in liver phthalein excretion. With hypertrophy of the adrenal fragment the excretion comes back to normal, but may fall again when more adrenal tissue is removed (text-figure 1). Pancreatic insufficiency causes a progressive fall in the phthalein excretion indicating a grave lowering of the functional capacity of the liver (text-figure 2). This fact has a direct bearing on the question of diabetes. Parathyroid insufficiency with tetany causes no decrease in phthalein output, but at times a rise above normal. This comes out best when the phthalein curve is low following pancreas extirpation. Parathyroid tetany may cause hyperactivity {{on the part of the}} liver cells. <b>Thyroid</b> <b>insufficiency</b> produces no change in the uniform curve of phthalein excretion. Hypophysis insufficiency shows an initial fall in the curve, followed by a return to normal and a final drop in the last few days before death. These experiments supply evidence to the effect that the liver is very much concerned in the derangement that follows the removal of the ductless glands. Hence it seems probable that this disturbance of the liver function may be an important factor in the general symptom complex of ductless gland insufficiency. In conclusion we wish to express our appreciation to Dr. S. J. Crowe and Dr. A. P. Jones for assistance rendered in performing some of the operations for gland removal...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Iodine {{is a key}} {{nutrient}} in neurodevelopment, and {{the fetus}} is entirely dependent on the iodine intake of the mother to fulfill this important requirement for proper brain function. While this is clearly known, it is uncertain if maternal iodine nutrition should be monitored separately against what is in current practice in public health programs to control iodine deficiency. Also, {{it is unclear whether}} it is beneficial to supplement pregnant women with iodine in mild-to moderately iodine deficient and also iodine sufficient areas. Finally, the role of thyroid dysfunction in depression during pregnancy is uncertain. Objectives: 1) to determine whether iodine supplementation to pregnant women improves maternal and newborn thyroid function, pregnancy outcome, birth weight, infant growth and cognitive performance; 2) to assess iodine intake and potential determinants of intake, in pregnant women and their children who were sharing all meals; 3) to measure thyroid status during pregnancy and assess potential determinants of maternal thyroid function including iodine status, thyroid autoimmunity, body weight and anemia; 4) to assess the association of maternal depression, and thyroid function during pregnancy. Methods: 1) In a randomized placebo controlled trial (RCT), the MITCH (Maternal Iodine Supplementation and its Effects on Thyroid function and CHild Development) study, pregnant women, gestational age ≤ 14 weeks, in Bangalore, India, were randomized to receive either a daily supplement of 200 µg oral iodine or placebo from enrolment until delivery. Women were followed through delivery, and then with postnatal follow-up of their infants at 6 weeks, 1 and 2 year. Early neonatal development was assessed using the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) at 6 weeks of age; neurocognitive assessment was done using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID III) at 1 and 2 years, and BRIEF-P (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function) at 2 years; 2) A cross-sectional study comparing iodine status of pregnant women and their children, who were sharing all meals in Bangalore, India; 3) A cross-sectional study among 334 pregnant women ≤ 14 weeks of gestation, in Bangalore, India, who were screened for the RCT; 4) Secondary analysis of the longitudinal data on 318 pregnant women in the RCT. Results: 1) In the RCT, {{there were no significant differences}} between groups in maternal thyroid function tests or thyroid volume during gestation. The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction or anti-TPO antibodies did not differ significantly during gestation and postpartum. Postpartum, there were no significant differences between the maternal and infant groups in thyroid function, birth outcomes or UIC. Neonates whose mothers received iodine supplementation during pregnancy had better orientation scores at 6 weeks of age and lower scores of inhibition suggesting better executive function at 2 years of age although neurocognitive development on the BSID III were not significantly different between groups; 2) In the pilot study, a) median UIC in pregnant women was 172 µg/L, b) the median UIC was > 150 µg/L in all trimesters and c) thyroid size was not significantly different across trimesters;  the median UIC in children was 220 µg/L, indicating ‘more than adequate’ iodine intake at this age. Median UIC was significantly higher in children than in their mothers (p= 0. 008). 3) In the cross-sectional study, 21 % women were vegetarian, 19 % were anemic and 23 % were overweight or obese. Iodized salt was used by 98 % of women and they were iodine sufficient, median UIC was 184. 2 µg/L and all had normal thyroid volume. However, 18 % of women had thyroid insufficiency: 3. 7 % had overt hypothyroidism (83 % with positive TPO-Ab), 9. 2 % had subclinical hypothyroidism and 5. 2 % had hypothyroxinemia. Women consuming vegetarian diets did not have significantly lower iodine intakes or higher risk of hypothyroidism than those consuming mixed diets, but overweight/obesity and anemia predicted thyroid insufficiency; 4) In the longitudinal study, there was no significant difference in depressive symptoms between the iodine intervention and placebo groups. Women with depressive symptoms had significantly lower serum TSH compared to women without depressive symptoms in the first trimester. Pregnant women with prenatal depressive symptoms had a significantly higher number of medical symptoms. Conclusion: 1) Iodine supplementation in mildly iodine deficient and in iodine sufficient pregnant women was well-accepted and safe and did not increase the risk of excess iodine intake, hyper- or hypothyroidism, or thyroid autoimmunity. Though there were no significant effects of iodine supplementation on neonatal and maternal thyroid function and birth outcomes, there were modest effects on neurocognitive development of children as assessed by executive function of children at 2 years. Thus, additional follow-up of these children for neurocognitive testing at a later age when development and cognitive testing is more reliable would provide valuable add on information; 2) The iodized salt program in Bangalore, India was providing adequate iodine to women throughout pregnancy, at the expense of higher iodine intake in their children, suggesting that the current WHO/UNICEF/ICCIDD cut-off for median UIC in children indicating more-than-adequate intake may need to be reconsidered; 3) Despite iodine sufficiency, many pregnant women had <b>thyroid</b> <b>insufficiency</b> predicted by low hemoglobin and higher BMI. The prevalence of overt hypothyroidism was > 5 -fold higher than reported in other iodine-sufficient populations of pregnant women, thus, screening of maternal thyroid function should be considered in antenatal care at hospitals in Bangalore, India; 4) Although iodine supplementation did not affect maternal depression, we highlighted the need for systemic screening for prenatal depression during antenatal visits as it is an independent risk factor for later development of clinical depression  ...|$|E
