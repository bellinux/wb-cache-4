40|$|There {{are good}} reasons to be {{initially}} hesitant about shaping criminal law rules to track the justice judgments of ordinary people. People seem to disagree about many criminal law issues. Their judgments, at least as reflected in many aspects of current law such as <b>three</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> high penalties for drug offenses, seem harsh to many. Effective crime control would seem to require the expertise of trained experts and scholars who understand the complexities of general deterrence and the identification and incapacitation of the dangerous. But this brief Essay, which reviews some previous studies and analyses, argues that distributing criminal liability and punishment according to the shared judgments of the community—so-called “empirical desert”—does not have the failings that many assume, such as those described above, and indeed ought to be preferred by both moral philosophers and crime-control utilitarians. It represents the best practical approximation of deontological desert. And it offers the greatest potential for effective crime control because, by tracking community views, the criminal law can build its moral credibility with the community and thereby harness the potentially enormous powers of social influence and internalized norms...|$|E
40|$|This article explores border {{policing}} {{as a way}} {{of governing}} illegal immi-gration. In particular, it focuses on the technical dimensions of this process— on border policing as a technology. Not just as any technology, however, but as a prophylactic one. Border policing is a prophylactic technology {{in the sense that it}} brings together an array of practical and intellectual mechanisms in an effort to affect the conduct of illegal immigrants in such as way as to forestall illicit border crossings. The goal here is social prophylaxis. It is to prevent undocumented immigrants from becoming ‘problems ’ in the social body through preventing their entry into the US. Key Words borders government illegality immigration technology Governing Immigration through Crime In this article, I would like to explore how undocumented immigrants in the United States have been governed since the 1990 s, with some attention paid to the aftermath of 9 / 11. 1 In particular, I want to focus on how this popu-lation has notably been governed through crime. Generally speaking, to govern through crime is to make crime and punishment the institutional context under which the efforts to guide the conduct of others takes place (Simon, 1997). Today, crime and punishment are a primary means through which political and other authorities generally seek to govern. This crucial facet of contemporary rule is clearly visible in the widespread popularity of tough-on-crime sentencing regimes of just desserts, deterrence, and retribution. These regimes include such measures as quality of life campaigns and zero tolerance policing, harsher penalties and the extensive utilization of imprisonment, <b>three</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> compulsory minimum sentencing policies, redress in juvenile court and the incarceration o...|$|E
40|$|We watch enthralled as {{television}} news programs sensationalize {{some of the}} saddest moments of our reality. We are shocked by the violence and brutality of those who prey on the innocent and vulnerable. We become both enraged and frightened as we {{realize that there are}} people among us who have no regard for human life. In the wake of tragedy, we furiously search for answers, we seek ways to avoid suffering the same pain in the future and, often, we sacrifice the rights of many, believing that such a sacrifice is necessary and justified. A prime example of this reaction is California 2 ̆ 7 s anti-recidivist legislation known colloquially as 2 ̆ 2 <b>three</b> <b>strikes</b> <b>and</b> you 2 ̆ 7 re out. 2 ̆ 2 This comment tracks an occurrence of this vicious cycle in California. Part I explains how the fear of crime as well as frustration with repeat offenders and the revolving door {{of the criminal justice system}} rose to an all-time high and contributed to the development of California 2 ̆ 7 s Three Strikes Law. This section also explores how the California Supreme Court has interpreted and attempted to refine the Three Strikes 2 ̆ 7 Law and specifically how the Court addressed the issue of judicial discretion in sentencing under the Three Strikes Law. Additionally, this section addresses the United States Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s analysis of what type of sentence violates a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional rights. Part II describes how California 2 ̆ 7 s lower courts have refused to employ judicial discretion. Part III shows why the application of the law, even with court-attempted refinement, is constitutionally flawed and may also be ineffective as a measure to prevent violent crime. Part IV explores the latest rulings from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal regarding the constitutionality of California 2 ̆ 7 s Three Strikes Law. This Part also suggests a solution to balance the citizens 2 ̆ 7 desire for a workable recidivist statute with the need to keep criminal punishment in California both fair and constitutional...|$|E
