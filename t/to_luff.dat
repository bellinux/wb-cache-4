"No, sir, so I thought, myself; and I only {{tried to}} look as melancholy as a young gentleman who is sent below to report a topgallant-mast over the side, or a studding-sail-boom gone in the iron. D'ye {{remember}} the time, Admiral Blue, when you thought <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> up on the old Planter's weather-quarter, and get {{between her and the}} French ninety on three decks, and how your stu'n-sails went, one a'ter another, just like so many musherrooms breaking in peeling?" ...|$|E

60|$|Fifteen minutes passed, the Reindeer sinking {{deeper and}} deeper, her {{mainsail}} flapping in the calm. But from off the Point Pedro shore I saw a dark line {{form on the}} water and travel toward us. It was the steady breeze I had been expecting so long. I called to the Chinese and pointed it out. They hailed it with exclamations. Then I pointed to the sail and to the water in the Reindeer, and indicated by signs that when the wind reached the sail, what of the water aboard we would capsize. But they jeered defiantly, for they knew it was in my power <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> the helm and let go the main-sheet, so as to spill the wind and escape damage.|$|E

60|$|The man at {{the wheel}} knew very well what was wanted, {{and he put his}} helm up, instead of putting it down, as he might have done without this injunction. As this change brought the brig before the wind, and Spike was in no hurry <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> up on the other tack, the Swash soon ran over a mile of the {{distance}} she had already made, putting her back that much {{on her way to the}} Neck. It is out of our power to say what the people of the different craft in sight thought of all this, but an opportunity soon offered of putting them on a wrong scent. A large coasting schooner, carrying everything that would draw on a wind, came sweeping under the stern of the Swash, and hailed.|$|E
6000|$|We {{ran up the}} Carquinez Straits and edged {{into the}} bight at Turner's Shipyard for {{smoother}} water. Here were lying several English steel sailing ships, waiting for the wheat harvest; and here, most unexpectedly, in the precise place where we had captured Big Alec, we came upon two Italians in a skiff that was loaded with a complete [...] "Chinese" [...] sturgeon line. The surprise was mutual, and we were {{on top of them}} before either they or we were aware. Charley had barely time <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> into the wind and run up to them. I ran forward and tossed them a line with orders to make it fast. One of the Italians took a turn with it over a cleat, while I hastened to lower our big spritsail. This accomplished, the salmon boat dropped astern, dragging heavily on the skiff.|$|E

Look at Master Morganic; he has his main course close-reefed on the Achilles, <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> into his station, and I'll warrant you will get a good six months' wear out of that ship in this one gale; {{loosening}} her knees, and jerking her spars like so many whip-handles; and all for love of the new fashion of rigging an English two-decker like an Algerian xebec! Well, let him tug his way up to windward, Bond-street fashion, if he likes the fun. What has become of the Chloe, Greenly?" ...|$|E

60|$|Long, {{long hours}} did Marble and I watch the {{progress}} of our ship that day and the succeeding night, each of us taking our tricks at the wheel, and doing seaman's duty, {{as well as that}} of mate and master. All this time, the vessel was dashing furiously out towards the Atlantic, which she reached ere the morning of the succeeding day. Just before he light returned we were whirled past a large ship that was lying-to, under a single storm-stay-sail, and which I recognised as the frigate that had taken a look at us at our anchorage. The cutter was close at hand, and the fearful manner in which these two strong-handed vessels pitched and lurched, gave me some idea of what must be our situation, should we be compelled <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> to the wind. I supposed they had done so, in order to keep as long as possible, on their cruising ground, near the chops of the Irish channel.|$|E
60|$|As the Druid {{approached}} the flag-ship, Captain Blewet {{had appeared in}} her weather mizzen-rigging, conning his vessel in person; and the order <b>to</b> <b>luff,</b> or keep off, had been given by his own voice, or by a gesture of his own hand. As {{soon as he saw}} Wycherly's feet on the poop of the Plantagenet, and his active form freed from the double-bowline, in which it had been seated, the captain made a wide sweep of the arm, to denote his desire to edge away; the helm of the frigate was borne up hard, and, as the two-decker surged ahead on the bosom of a sea, the Druid's bows were knocked off to leeward, leaving a space of about a hundred feet, or more, between the two ships, as it might be, in an instant. The same causes continuing to operate, the Plantagenet drove still farther ahead, while the frigate soon came to the wind again, a cable's-length to leeward, and abreast of the space between the admiral and his second, astern. Here, Captain Blewet seemed disposed to wait for further orders.|$|E
60|$|Half an hour later, things {{drew near}} a crisis. We had been obliged <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> a little, {{in order to}} clear a reef that even Marble {{admitted}} lay off Montauk, while the Leander had kept quite as much away, {{with a view to}} close. This brought the fifty so near us, directly on our weather beam, as to induce her commander to try the virtue of gunpowder. Her bow-gun was fired, and its shot, only a twelve-pounder, richoch√®d until it fairly passed our fore-foot, distant a hundred yards, making its last leap from the water precisely in a line with the stem of the Dawn. This was unequivocal evidence that the game could not last much longer, unless the space between the two vessels should be sensibly widened. Fortunately, we now opened Montauk fort, and the option was offered us of doubling that point, and entering the sound, or of standing oh towards Block Island, and putting the result on our heels. After a short consultation with Marble, I decided on the first.|$|E
5000|$|A {{downhaul}} may {{be attached}} to the boom near the gooseneck to pull the boom down and increase tension on the luff (forward edge) of the sail. If no downhaul is present, the gooseneck is usually fixed vertically to the mast and a cunningham may be used <b>to</b> control <b>luff</b> tension.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, Glover, I {{will make}} a note of that, and if you ever misbehave {{yourself}} {{and we have to}} sell you, I will drop a line <b>to</b> the first <b>luff</b> how your preference lies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, and a most partic'lar fine officer he is, {{as every}} body says. Well, sir, he's with the ladies; while his namesake {{has gone back}} to the table, and has put <b>luff</b> upon <b>luff,</b> <b>to</b> fetch up leeway." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{not long}} before the Druid was within a hundred fathoms of the flag-ship, on her weather-quarter, shoving the brine before her in a way to denote a fearful momentum. It was evidently the {{intention}} of Captain Blewet to cross the Plantagenet's stern, and <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> up under her lee quarter; the safest point at which he could approach, in so heavy a swell, provided it were done with discretion. Captain Blewet had a reputation for handling his frigate like a boat, and the occasion was one which would be likely to awaken all his desire to sustain the character he had already earned. Still no one could imagine how he was to come near enough to make a communication of any length. The stentorian lungs of the second lieutenant, however, might effect it; and, as the news of the expected hail passed through the ship, many who had remained below, in apathy, while the enemy was close under their lee, came on deck, curious to witness what was about to pass.|$|E
60|$|Just {{as the sun}} rose, {{the captain}} and chief-mate made their {{appearance}} on deck. At first they agreed in supposing the stranger a stray English West-Indiaman, bound home; for, at that time, few merchant vessels were met at sea that were not English or American. The former usually sailed in convoys, however; and the captain accounted for the circumstance {{that this was not}} thus protected, by the fact of her sailing so fast. She might be a letter-of-marque, like ourselves, and vessels of that character did not take convoy. As the two vessels lay exactly abeam of each other, with square yards, it was not easy to judge of the sparring of the stranger, except by means of his masts. Marble, judging by the appearance of his topsails, began to think our neighbour might be a Frenchman, he had so much hoist to the sails. After some conversation on the subject, the captain ordered me to brace forward the yards, as far as our studding-sails would allow, and <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> nearer to the stranger. While the ship was thus changing her course, the day advanced, and our crew got their breakfast.|$|E
60|$|I did not {{venture to}} run the Dawn {{directly}} down in the Englishman's wake, but we kept her off and on, rather, taking good care not to go {{within a mile of}} her. All this time the Speedy was playing upon the Cerf's quarter. The latter ship becoming too crippled <b>to</b> <b>luff,</b> while Mons. Menneval was travelling off to leeward, unmolested, having obtained an advantage in the way of speed, that he was unwilling to put in any jeopardy, by coming again under fire. This officer did not want for spirit, but the French had got to be so accustomed to defeat, in their naval encounters with the English, that, like several other nations on the land, they Had begun to look upon victory as hopeless. The Cerf was very nobly fought. Notwithstanding the disadvantages under which she laboured, that ship held out until the Black Prince had actually given her a close broadside on her larboard quarter; the Speedy being kept the whole time on her starboard, with great skill, pouring in a nearly unresisted fire. The Cerf struck only as she found that the battle was to be two to one, and under so many other disadvantages, in the bargain.|$|E

60|$|The Carnatic was {{scarcely}} {{out of the}} way, before the Achilles was ready to take her place. This ship, having more room, had easily <b>luffed</b> <b>to</b> windward of the Plantagenet, simply letting go her bowlines, as her bows doubled on the admiral's stern, in order to check her way.|$|R
5000|$|An {{innovation}} that improved the sail's performance was the beitass, or stretching pole [...] - [...] a wooden spar stiffening the sail. The windward {{performance of the}} ship was poor by modern standards as there was no centreboard, deep keel or leeboard. To assist in tacking the beitass kept the luff taut. Bracing lines were attached <b>to</b> the <b>luff</b> and led through holes on the forward gunwale. Such holes were often reinforced with short sections of timber about 500 to 700 mm long {{on the outside of}} the hull.|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} of the basins named, the {{schooner}} wore short round on her heel, her foresail being set to help her. A breathless moment passed as she ran down towards the narrow strait. It was quickly reached, and that none too soon; the opening now not exceeding sixty feet. The yards of the vessel almost brushed the rocks in passing; but she went clear. As soon as in the lower basin, as one might call it, the jib and foresail were taken in, {{and the head of the}} mainsail was got on the craft. This helped her <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> up towards the slip, which she reached under sufficient head-way fairly to enter it. Lines were thrown to the people on the ice, who soon hauled the schooner up to the head of her frozen dock. Three cheers broke spontaneously out of the throats of the men, as they thus achieved the step which assured them of the safety of the vessel, so far as the ice was concerned! In this way do we estimate our advantages and disadvantages, by comparison. In the abstract, the situation of the sealers was still sufficiently painful; though compared with what it would have been with the other schooner wrecked, it was security itself.|$|E
6000|$|The lead {{proved a}} better guide than Michael, and seeing some {{breakers}} in-shore of us, I {{gave the order}} to clew up the main-top-sail, and <b>to</b> <b>luff</b> to the wind, before the ship should lose her way. Our Irishmen pulled and hauled well enough, {{as soon as they}} were directed what to do; which enabled Marble and myself each to stand by a stopper. We had previously got the two bowers a-cock-bill, (the cables were bent as soon as we made the land); and nothing remained but to let run. Neb was at the wheel, with orders to spring to the cables as soon as he heard them running out, and everything was in readiness. I shouted the order to [...] "let run," [...] and down both our anchors went, at the same instant, in twenty-two fathoms' water. The ship took cable at a fearful rate; but Marble and Diogenes being at one bower, and Neb and I at the other, we succeeded in snubbing her, with something like twenty fathoms within the hawse-holes. There was a minute, when I thought the old bark would get away from us; and when, by desperate efforts, we did succeed in checking the mass, it seemed as if she would shake the windlass out of her. No time was lost in stoppering the cables, and in rolling up the main-top-sail.|$|E
60|$|Sure enough a {{ship was}} meeting us, heading {{up on the}} {{larboard}} tack about west-north-west, as she stretched in towards the English coast. I can see that vessel, in my mind's eye, even at this distant day! She had two reefs in her top-sails, with spanker, jib, and both courses set, like a craft that carried convenient, rather than urgent canvass. Her line of sailing would take her about two hundred yards to leeward of us, and my first impulse was <b>to</b> <b>luff.</b> A second glance showed us she was an English frigate, and we doused our lugg as soon as possible. Our hearts were in our mouths {{for the next five}} minutes. My eye never turned from that frigate, as she hove by us, now rising on the summit of a sea, now falling gracefully into the trough, concealing everything but her spars from sight. Glad enough were we, when she had got so far ahead as to bring us well on her weather-quarter, though we did not dare set our sail again, until her dark, glistening hull, with its line of frowning ports, was shut up in the cloud of mist, leaving the spot on the ocean where she had last been seen, as if she were not. That was one of those hair-breadth escapes that often occur to men engaged in hazardous undertakings, without any direct agency of their own.|$|E
6000|$|The bicycle boy calmly {{sat down}} to keep {{his eye on the}} runaway, calling out from time to time such cheering remarks as [...] "All aboard for Liverpool! Give my love <b>to</b> Victoria! <b>Luff</b> and bear away when you come to Halifax! If you are hard up for provisions, you'll find an apple and some bait in my coat-pocket," [...] and other {{directions}} for a comfortable voyage, till his voice was lost in the distance as a stronger current bore her swiftly away and the big waves began to tumble and splash.|$|R
60|$|Herrick {{gave her}} a spoke or two in silence; his eye, as it skirted from the needle <b>to</b> the <b>luff</b> of the foresail, passed the man by without speculation. But Huish was really dull, a thing he could support with difficulty, having no {{resources}} of his own. The idea of a private talk with Herrick, {{at this stage of}} their relations, held out particular inducements to a person of his character. Drink besides, as it renders some men hyper-sensitive, made Huish callous. And it would almost have required a blow to make him quit his purpose.|$|R
50|$|A jackline {{is also a}} rope {{installed}} in the luff of a mainsail <b>to</b> allow the <b>luff</b> slides <b>to</b> migrate horizontally away from the mast when the sail is reefed. By allowing the slides to migrate, more space is left in the mast track for the upper <b>luff</b> slides <b>to</b> descend, making the operation easier.|$|R
