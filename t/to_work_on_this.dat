5|$|In {{the initial}} {{part of his}} NBA career, Parker was still {{considered}} an erratic shooter of the ball and during the 2005 off-season, Coach Popovich decided <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> aspect of his play. Spurs shooting coach Chip Engelland forbade Parker to shoot any three-point shots, and among others, corrected his shooting motion and his thumb position. As a result, by the 2006–07 season, Parker had reduced his three-point shots by 117 while shooting 147 more normal field goal attempts compared to 2005, and his accuracy rose by 4% (field goals and three-point shots) {{and he was able}} to connect on 78% of his free throws that season. Parker's field goal percentage is also high for a point guard, and his speed also makes him a fast break player. However, his style of play has had adverse effects on his knees (tendinitis).|$|E

25|$|Flooding {{was always}} an issue for the Plaza and the city in general. The plaza was flooded in 1629 with water two meters deep, ruining many of the merchants located there and {{requiring}} many of the portals to be rebuilt. The project to control flooding, known as the desagüe drafted Indian men over nearly the whole colonial period, <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> major infrastructure project. Controlling flooding meant health benefits for Mexico City residents by preventing human waste from polluting the city during floods and controlling mosquitoes, which spread disease. However, it also changed the ecological system that supported birds and fish populations and allowed for Indian cultivation of crops.|$|E
25|$|In May 1861 a narrow-gauge tramway was {{constructed}} from the incline to Belmore Basin (Wollongong Harbour) after the Mount Keira Tramways Act {{was passed by}} parliament. In 1878 the tramroad was widened to standard gauge and horse teams used for hauling the coal were replaced by steam locomotives. These locomotives, the Keira No. 1 and Keira No. 2 were the first locomotives <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> coal route but steam locomotives were earlier used at Bulli Colliery from 1867 – even though the first Bulli locomotive purchased proved too heavy for the track which had previously been designed for an ingenious gravitational coal-skip incline to the jetty over four cuttings and four bridges. The locomotives at Keira ceased running in 1954 when the line was closed.|$|E
25|$|As {{municipalities}} {{expanded their}} {{water supply and}} sewerage networks, there was a growing need for pipes, but a diminishing need for reservoir tanks. Monier was obliged to go further from urban areas in search of clients. In 1886, he was granted Patent 175513 for a system applicable to housing. The technique is recorded in photographs of a demonstration house which is shown under construction; completed; and in course of demolition. Monier described the house as proof against earthquakes, ice, humidity, heat, and fire and received a commission to build such a house in Nice, possibly {{as a result of a}} recent earthquake. Monier's second son Paul asked <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> project. On 24 November 1887, Paul was killed when he fell from the scaffolding. As Monier's eldest son, Pierre, had severed his relationship with his father over a family argument, Joseph found himself with no sons of working age to help him in the business.|$|E

On 17 March 1739, while still working on this revision, Bach was informed that {{the performance of the}} Passion setting could not go ahead without official permission, thus (most likely) effectively halting any plans for that year. In response, Bach performed the Brockes-Passion of his friend, Georg Philipp Telemann (TVWV 5:1). [...] However, though he had stopped at measure 42 of Movement 10, he continued <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> revision, as shown by the copyists' score and parts.

500|$|Byrne visited Eno's London {{studio to}} listen to the demos and the two decided to {{collaborate}} to finish writing the songs, leaving Eno and PeterChilvers to convert a variety of digitalmusic formats into MIDI, thereby stripping out extraneous information and making them suitable for Byrne to embellish. (Chilvers would be thanked in the liner notes for [...] "Digital Archaeology".) The two continued <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> and other musical projects for several months and agreed that if the project was not enjoyable, they would abandon it. The duo decided to not announce their new collaboration for fear that they may not complete an album's worth of new material, or that they would end up re-treading their previous collaborations and decide against releasing the new songs.|$|E
500|$|... "Hell Is Other Robots" [...] lampoons drug {{addiction}} and religious conversion. In the DVD commentary for the episode, David X. Cohen, Matt Groening and Eric Kaplan {{all agreed that}} they felt comfortable enough {{with each of the}} Futurama characters to begin to take them in new and strange directions. Cohen noted that Bender's addiction {{is a perfect example of}} something they could do with a robot character which they could not get away with had it been a human character. One person at the studio refused <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> episode because they did not agree with the portrayal of some of the religious content. Cohen also noted that the writing team had begun to loosen up during this episode, which gave it a feel similar to the series' later episodes.

All of the living members of the original Star Trek cast agreed to appear in the episode with the exception of James Doohan, whose agent replied with [...] "No way." [...] Because of this, the episode's working title was jokingly named [...] "We got everybody but Scotty" [...] and so Scotty was replaced with [...] "Welshie". William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy recorded their lines together, which was unusual as actors usually record solo. Following his work on Futurama, Goodman went on to join the writing staff on Star Trek: Enterprise.|$|E

50|$|Chris Kelmi gained {{his fame}} as a {{composer}} partially thanks <b>to</b> his <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> film.

These songs were equally popular with Mikhail Boyarsky's of the d'Artagnan and Three Musketeers (1978), the miniseries that Dog in Boots parodies.|$|R
500|$|Despite this evident industry, Gibbons was {{dismissed}} from the Standard in August 1930. This was ostensibly an economy measure although Gibbons, in later life, suspected other reasons, particularly the increasing distraction from work that arose from {{her relationship with}} [...] Walter Beck. The engagement had ended painfully in 1928, primarily because Gibbons {{was looking for a}} fully committed relationship whereas he wanted something [...] more open. Her biographer and nephew, Reggie Oliver, believes Gibbons never entirely got over Beck, even after 1929 when she met Allan Webb, her future husband. She was not unemployed for long; she quickly accepted a job offer as an editorial assistant at the [...] women's magazine, The Lady. Here, according to The Observer writer Rachel Cooke, [...] "she applied her versatility as a writer to every subject under the sun bar cookery, which was the province of a certain Mrs Peel." [...] At the same time she began work on the novel that would become Cold Comfort Farm; her colleague and friend Elizabeth Coxhead recorded that Gibbons [...] "neglected her duties disgracefully" [...] <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> project.|$|E
500|$|M. G. Ramachandran {{was cast}} in the title role, this being the final film of his three-film {{contract}} with Modern Theatres, following Manthiri Kumari (1950) and Sarvadhikari (1951). He was paid [...] for acting in the film. The screenplay was written {{in a way that}} would suit his then [...] "swashbucking" [...] image, as opposed to the original story where Ali Baba was a [...] "gullible simpleton". P. S. Veerappa was cast as Abu Hussain, the leader of the forty thieves. Padmini was initially given the role of the female lead Marziana, but she was replaced subsequently by Bhanumathi Ramakrishna. Bhanumathi liked the film, one of her earliest in Tamil, because she found the character a [...] "go-getter". In her autobiography, Bhanumathi noted that after she heard the story, she considered her role to be much better than that in Missamma (1955), from which she was fired after filming only four reels, adding that after she accepted <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> film, she got more acting offers from Tamil film producers.|$|E
500|$|One day, {{the protagonists}} {{seek out a}} dervish known as a great philosopher of the land. Pangloss asks him why Man is made to suffer so, and what they all ought to do. The dervish {{responds}} by asking rhetorically why Pangloss {{is concerned about the}} existence of evil and good. The dervish describes human beings as mice on a ship sent by a king to Egypt; their comfort does not matter to the king. The dervish then slams his door on the group. Returning to their farm, Candide, Pangloss, and Martin meet a Turk whose philosophy is to devote his life only to simple work and not concern himself with external affairs. He and his four children cultivate a small area of land, and the work keeps them [...] "free of three great evils: boredom, vice, and poverty." [...] Candide, Pangloss, Martin, Cunégonde, Paquette, Cacambo, the old woman, and Brother Giroflée all set <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> [...] "commendable plan" [...] (louable dessein) on their farm, each exercising his or her own talents.
