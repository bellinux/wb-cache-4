5|$|Amato's {{prospective}} buyer is intercepted and arrested. The FBI {{had initially}} planned to send {{one of their}} agents undercover in his place, but Tubbs volunteers for the role, fearing the agent is too inexperienced. Tubbs meets with Amato and his henchmen, who demonstrate one of the Stingers and explain how <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> civilian airplane with an unarmed missile. Tubbs agrees to purchase all of Amato's inventory and arranges another meet to make the buy. That night, Crockett, surveilling Amato's house, sees him beat Rita again, and is unable to intervene.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September he was {{formally}} appointed as unit adjutant, swiftly {{followed by a}} temporary promotion to captain. He formally {{changed his name to}} Wilder-Neligan in October, and remained at Anzac until November, after which the battalion was evacuated to Egypt. During its time in Egypt, the 9th Battalion was stationed for a period on the front line in the desert near the Suez Canal. On one occasion, an Ottoman patrol was seen, and the adventurous Wilder-Neligan asked to be allowed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> patrol on camels to cut them off. With certain restrictions, this was permitted, but no contact with the enemy occurred. In March 1916, he relinquished his post of adjutant, and was substantively promoted to captain before the battalion left Alexandria for France and the Western Front {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|The Argentine–Chilean naval {{arms race}} was {{extremely}} expensive for both countries. The Argentine government {{was able to}} purchase £4,534,800 worth of ships between 1890 and 1898 with large foreign loans, which were given to them despite the country's role in the Baring crisis of 1890. The government's total foreign debt reached 421million gold pesos by 1896. As for Chile, it was forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> £2million pound loan in order to purchase Krupp weaponry, and this combined with its other loans led the banking industry to suspend loans to Chile until the diplomatic crisis with Argentina was solved. Both the Argentine President Julio Argentino Roca and American ambassador to Argentina William Paine Lord ascribed {{the ending of the}} arms race to the diminished credit of Argentina and Chile.|$|E

5|$|The {{delayed release}} of Odin Sphere led to {{issues with the}} company: they needed to start other {{projects}} to keep their company going, leading {{to the development of}} GrimGrimoire. The development of GrimGrimoire drained the company's funds, forcing Kamitani <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> flexible loan of 20 million yen to keep the company afloat and fund development for their next projects, in addition to finding these projects new publishers as Atlus refused to take any more of Vanillaware's products until they had seen how Odin Sphere performed commercially. Nippon Ichi Software would handle GrimGrimoire, while Marvelous Entertainment accepted their next project, Muramasa: The Demon Blade for the Wii. The commercial success of Odin Sphere both enabled the development of Muramasa: The Demon Blade and cleared Kamitani's debt. In tandem with their other titles, Odin Sphere helped establish Vanillaware as a respected developer.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 U.S. Senate {{election}} in Massachusetts, Kennedy faced his first serious challenger, the young, telegenic, and very well-funded Mitt Romney. Romney ran {{as a successful}} entrepreneur and Washington outsider with a strong family image and moderate stands on social issues, while Kennedy was saddled not only with his recent past but the 25th anniversary of Chappaquiddick and his first wife Joan seeking a renegotiated divorce settlement. By mid-September 1994, polls showed the race to be even. Kennedy's campaign ran short on money, and belying his image as endlessly wealthy, he was forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> second mortgage on his Virginia home. Kennedy responded {{with a series of}} attack ads, which focused both on Romney's shifting political views and on the treatment of workers at a paper products plant owned by Romney's Bain Capital. Kennedy's new wife Vicki proved to be a strong asset in campaigning. Kennedy and Romney held a widely watched late October debate without a clear winner, but by then Kennedy had pulled ahead in polls and stayed ahead afterward. In the November election, despite a very bad outcome for the Democratic Party nationally, Kennedy won re-election by a 58percent to 41percent margin, the closest re-election race of his career.|$|E
5|$|Specialised armour {{arriving}} in the first wave included AVREs, mine flails, and armoured bulldozers. Clearing paths off the beach proved difficult, as the tanks got stuck in the mud or were taken out by mines. A lone mine flail tank finally cleared a path from the beach up toward the Mont Fleury Battery and Ver-Sur-Mer. This route {{was used by the}} Green Howards and tanks of the 4th/7th Dragoon Guards, who cleared the remaining resistance at the Mont Fleury Battery. B Company moved on to attack trench positions and machine gun emplacements at Meuvaines Ridge, while C Company moved to the west of Ver-Sur-Mer to help cover the assault on Crépon, where roads led to the important targets of Bayeux and Caen. The 7th Green Howards attacked the gun battery at Ver-Sur-Mer, where they took 50 prisoners. Colour Sergeant-Major Stanley Hollis earned the only Victoria Cross to be bestowed for actions on D-Day. On the way to the Mont Fleury Battery, Hollis came under machine gun fire while investigating a pillbox, so he shot into the entrance with his Sten gun and dropped a grenade through the roof, killing most of the occupants. He cleared a nearby trench of enemy soldiers, whereupon the occupants of a second pillbox surrendered. Later in the day, he saved the lives of three men during an attempt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> field artillery installation at a farm near Crépon.|$|E

5|$|When Archie returns, he {{attempts}} to reconcile with Peggy, but {{comes up with a}} plan to steal the Mitchells' business, The Queen Victoria public house, with Janine's help. However, Janine, along with Ryan, whom she is dating, plans to steal it from Archie at the last minute. Peggy's daughter Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook), who has been in Brazil on the run from police due to her involvement in the murder of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), returns to Walford, thinking the charges have been dropped. She is subsequently arrested, and the Mitchells put up £250,000 bail to have her released. Archie convinces Sam to leave again, paying for her to go. Phil is then forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> loan from Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Ian accepts, on the condition that if the loan is not paid back within a certain time, he becomes owner of The Queen Victoria. Archie and Janine learn of this and try to get Ian to sell the loan to them. When Ian's wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) leaves him, Janine gets him drunk and has sex with him, making an audio recording of them together. Archie and Janine blackmail Ian into selling them the loan and Archie tells the Mitchells they are trespassing. Once Archie finds out that Janine plans to fleece him, he proposes to her to keep her from going astray. Ryan is hurt by this setback and ends his relationship with her. Ronnie stands up to Archie and he pushes her into the bar, not knowing she is pregnant, though Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) then reveals it. Ronnie has a miscarriage and Peggy tells Archie he has killed another of Ronnie's children, warning him to stay away from her. Peggy eventually hands over the keys and the family of Peggy, Phil, Ronnie, Roxy, Ben Mitchell (Charlie Jones) and Roxy's baby Amy Mitchell leave on 24 December 2009. They end up being taken in by Jack, who vows revenge on Archie.|$|E

5000|$|Australia had no Plant Breeder's Rights Act at that time. The {{only way}} to secure rights was <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> {{overseas}} patent.

25|$|In 1835, two inventors in Britain, John Ericsson and Francis Pettit Smith, {{began working}} {{separately}} on the problem.

25|$|According to {{prominent}} Jewish {{writers of}} the Middle Ages, if a man is absent from his wife for a long period, the wife {{should be allowed to}} sell her husband's property, if necessary to sustain herself.

25|$|From the 15th century onwards, whisky {{was heavily}} taxed in Scotland, {{to the point}} that most of the spirit was {{produced}} illegally. However, in 1823, Parliament passed an act making commercial distillation much more profitable, while imposing punishments on landowners when unlicensed distilleries were found on their properties. George Smith was the first person <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> licence for a distillery under the new law, founding the Glenlivet Distillery in 1824.|$|E
5|$|The {{objections}} {{were particularly}} {{raised by the}} Merchant Maiden Hospital, which owned the land {{on the south side}} of the Ugie. Despite being advised <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> interdict <b>to</b> prevent the work, in January 1797 the Hospital did not feel it had a strong enough case. However, four months later when two miles of the canal had been dug up to where the north and south Ugie joined, the Hospital did apply for an interdict, and this was granted in July 1797.|$|R
50|$|Between the two {{ministries}} in 1949, at {{the request}} of Gonzalez Videla, he acquired, along with Raúl Jaras, the rights to the shares of La Hora newspaper, which in fact belonged to the Radical Party, but which was virtually bankrupt. Efforts to clean up the newspaper failed, so Picó and Jaras decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>an</b> evening paper, La Tercera de la Hora, which appeared on 7 July 1950.

25|$|Boyer {{believed}} that the constant threat of a French invasion was stymieing the Haitian economy and thus {{felt the need to}} settle the matter once and for all. The negotiations for the indemnity were rather one sided however as French warships were anchored off the coast. The resulting indemnity bankrupted the Haitian treasury. Haiti was therefore forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> loan from French banks, who provided the funds for the large first installment, severely affecting Haiti's ability to prosper. Haitian forces, led by Boyer, invaded neighboring Dominican Republic in February 1822—beginning a 22-year occupation.|$|E

The company rented larger quarters at 3330 Colorado Street, and began manufacturing pH meters. The pH meter is an important device for measuring the pH of a solution, and by 11 May 1939, sales were successful enough that Beckman left Caltech to become the full-time president of National Technical Laboratories. By 1940, Beckman was able <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> loan to build his own 12,000 square foot factory in South Pasadena.|$|E

His match with Djokovic was widely considered one of the greatest clay court matches ever played, as Nadal came back from down a break in the fifth set <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> hard-fought 4-hour, 37-minute victory. However, because of the nuances of how rankings are calculated (including an improvement in performance by the then world No. 5 David Ferrer at the French Open), Nadal's world ranking dropped from No. 4 to No. 5, with Ferrer replacing him at No. 4.|$|E
