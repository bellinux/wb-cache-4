In this study, we identify several problems with this orthodox measure concerning its age, informal construction, and incorporation of inappropriate networks. We introduce a trichotomous network measure of world-system position that addresses these concerns, applying Borgatti and Everett’s (1999) core/periphery model to a three-tiered partition using international trade data. Our trichotomous measure of the trade network identifies an expanded core, consisting of an old orthodox core joined by a set of upwardly mobile states. We estimate the effect of world-system position on economic growth and find that our <b>trade</b> <b>measure</b> significantly outperforms Snyder and Kick’s orthodox measure. When controlling for human capital, the strong effects of our <b>trade</b> <b>measure</b> persist, while the weaker effects estimated by the orthodox measure largely disappear.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which international trade law can serve as a means to enforce workers' rights in developing countries, considered from a human rights point of view. The first chapter {{examines the}} protection of the most important workers rights under international law. The basic problem in this protection is that workers' rights are limited in their enforcement. Therefore, international <b>trade</b> <b>measures</b> could be used to enforce these rights. A first way to use international trade law for the enforcement of workers' rights is by unilaterally imposing a set of workers' rights in the trade relations between two countries. This is the topic of the second chapter. These measures are used in both the United States and the European Community. Unilateral <b>trade</b> <b>measures</b> can be distinguished as non-reciprocal trade aid programs and reciprocal trade relations, the former being much less controversial that the latter from an international law point view. In the third chapter, multilateral <b>trade</b> <b>measures,</b> the second way to use international <b>trade</b> <b>measures,</b> are discussed. This discussion focuses on the social clause in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade context and similar regimes. This study will demonstrate the position that a social clause is to be favoured, but only as an additional way to enforce workers' rights, and only if changes to the existing procedures are made. The thesis concludes by calling for a social dimension in international trade regulation, but warns that a social clause in a multilateral trade agreement should be approached with realism and prudence...|$|R

The current lack of transparency caused by conflicting rules increases the degree of risk perceived in the international commercial environment.
