40|$|Why {{is it that}} "Steal Away" {{is better}} known than "Jesus on the Waterside?" This {{question}} can only be answered by examining the history of how Spirituals {{were brought to the}} attention of audiences beyond <b>the</b> plantation. Negro <b>Spirituals</b> began as a folk music tradition and were later developed into concert music for performance. Along the way, this genre was described, notated, catalogued, studied, and arranged by individuals from various ideological perspectives, which led to the following questions and debates: 1. Can African Americans produce beautiful music? 2. Why do African Americans sing? 3. Are African Americans content to await freedom in Heaven? 4. Are <b>the</b> <b>Spirituals</b> original compositions or imitations of European music? 5. Are <b>the</b> <b>Spirituals</b> a source of dignity or shame? 6. What can contemporary society learn from the message of <b>the</b> <b>Spirituals?</b> 7. How should <b>the</b> <b>Spirituals</b> be performed? <b>The</b> debates that most directly affected <b>the</b> canon of <b>Spirituals</b> are <b>the</b> final three questions, which originated among African Americans after emancipation and were especially influential at freedmen schools in the South, where the tradition of singing Spirituals as concert music was established...|$|R

2500|$|In this {{understanding}} of salvation, {{the purpose of the}} Incarnation was to redeem <b>the</b> <b>Spirituals</b> from their material bodies. [...] By taking a material body, the Son becomes the Savior and facilitates this entrance into the pleroma by making it possible for <b>the</b> <b>Spirituals</b> to receive his spiritual body. [...] However, in becoming a body and soul, the Son Himself becomes one of those needing redemption. [...] Therefore, the Word descends onto the Savior at His Baptism in the Jordan, which liberates the Son from his corruptible body and soul. [...] His redemption from the body and soul is then applied to <b>the</b> <b>Spirituals.</b> [...] In response to this Gnostic view of Christ, Irenaeus emphasized that the Word became flesh and developed a soteriology that emphasized the significance of Christ's material Body in saving humanity, as discussed in the sections above.|$|R

The setting was inspired by monumental Saint Michael's Abbey in Susa Valley, Piedmont and visited by Umberto Eco. <b>The</b> <b>Spirituals</b> abhor wealth, bordering on the Apostolics or Dulcinian heresy. The book highlights this tension that existed within Christianity during the medieval era: <b>the</b> <b>Spirituals,</b> one faction within the Franciscan order, demanded that the Church should abandon all wealth, and some heretical sects began killing the well-to-do, while the majority of the Franciscans and the clergy took to a broader interpretation of the gospel.
