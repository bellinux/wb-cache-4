The display unit, incorporating an analogue gauge similar to a Voltmeter, was attached by a cable to a separate, strain gauged torque transducer.

The visually impaired have been helped {{through the use of}} computerized braillers, embossers, and readers. Both adaptations of off-the-shelf software and specialized software have provided the visually impaired with magnification of print on the computer screen, voice synthesis, Braille word processing, and access to databases of assistive devices. Microcomputers have given the hearing impaired access to telephone communication (the Telecommunications for the Deaf device), lip reading training, synthesized speech, and computer assisted instruction.

40|$|A <b>touch</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>screen</b> {{displays}} {{the information on}} the screen and also receives the input by sensing a user's touch on the same screen. This mechanism facilitates system interaction directly through the screen without needing a mouse or keyboard.

The display screens of portable devices are becoming smaller thereby leaving lesser space for display of data, menu or touch screen interaction. Besides some screens need to display so much of information that they hardly can afford any space to display touch screen buttons. This article illustrates various inventions which have successfully eliminated these difficulties by applying appropriate Inventive principles. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

He was influenced by ideas circulated by Oracle's Larry Ellison and Sun Microsystems's Scott McNealy envisioning inexpensive networked computers and in response created the Web Sonic subsidiary to create displays whose main function was as an Internet appliance. Web Sonic's first product launched in 2000 was a 5-pound Web phone with a <b>touch</b> <b>sensitive</b> color <b>screen</b> that could access the Internet and had an e-mail indicator light to alert users to messages.

Motorola's strategy of grabbing market share by selling tens of millions of low-cost Razrs cut into margins and resulted in heavy losses in the cellular division.|$|R

The simplicity of this tracking system is such {{that it would be}} possible to integrate the whole system on a chip, making it an interesting input interface for portable computing devices.

The recognition of three dimensional gestures is also studied, opening the way to a more complex interaction mode and to other kinds of applications. Input of information is becoming a challenging task as portable electronic devices become smaller.

40|$|The {{research}} examined distributed {{computer based}} process control systems. A functional analysis {{was done to}} identify the subunits that make up such a system.

An economic analysis was also carried out to determine the optimum distribution of the control task. It was concluded that, on present costs, each controller should contain eight control loops. The controllers and man machine interfaces should be distributed along a multidrop communications line. Based on these analyses, a system was implemented within the department. It used an M 6800 microcomputer for the controller and the departmental PDP 11 minicomputer for the man machine interfaces.

5000|$|While at the University of Pennsylvania, Kaplan {{wrote the}} {{software}} for the first all-digital keyboard instrument, the Synergy, sold by Music Technology, Inc. In 1980. The Synergy was used by Wendy Carlos to score the soundtrack for the 1982 movie Tron. After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Kaplan joined the computer science department at Stanford University. He was a research associate with Stanford between 1979 and 1981. While at Stanford he wrote the database backend for the first personal computer natural language query system that became the first product of Symantec, called Q&A. In 1981 he co-founded the company Teknowledge, Inc., a publicly traded artificial intelligence company. Kaplan was hired by Lotus Development Corporation to develop and design software based on Al techniques, working as the company's principal technologist. While at Lotus he developed Lotus Agenda, an early DOS-based personal information manager along with Ed Belove and Mitchell Kapor. He {{got the idea for}} another venture while riding in a plane with Kapor and discussing computer technology and the need for a notebook type computer. This idea led to the founding of GO Corporation. [...] Kaplan co-founded GO Corporation in 1987. He believed the next generation of computers would be hand-held digital notepads which people would use a pen to write on the screen instead of typing. The company focused on developing a new type of operating system for tablet computers with <b>touch</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>screens.</b> The flagship product of GO Corporation, which survived the company by many years, was PenPoint, winner of Byte Magazine's Byte Award for best operating system 1992. Go Corporation was famous for pioneering pen computer technology as well as being one of the most well-funded start-up companies during the late 1980s. The technology developed by the company was a precursor to early portable computers including the Palm Pilot and the Apple Newton, and most recently in iOS products such as Apple's iPad. AT&T Corporation became a major investor in the company, using GO's technology to develop the EO Personal Communicator, the world's first smart phone. GO Corporation was later sold to AT&T Corporation. Kaplan later authored Startup: A Silicon Valley Adventure, a book {{about the history of the}} company in which he details his experience with company investors as well as pitching the idea to Microsoft and Apple who began to develop their own tablets as opposed to investing in GO. The book was selected as one of the Top Ten Business Books of the Year by Businessweek and was translated into Chinese, Japanese and Portuguese.|$|R
