2500|$|Director Marc Webb has {{described}} the film {{as more of a}} [...] "coming of age" [...] story as opposed to a [...] "rom-com".

It's about happiness, and learning that you'll find it within yourself, rather than in the big blue eyes of the girl in <b>the</b> <b>cubicle</b> down the hall. I wanted to make an unsentimental movie and an uncynical movie. In my mind, I wanted it to be something you could dance to. That's why we put a parenthesis in the title – it's like a pop song in movie form. It's not a big film. It's not about war or poverty. It's about 500 days in a young guy's relationship, but it's no less deserving of scrutiny. When your heart is first broken, it consumes you. And it's an emotion I wanted to make a movie about, before I forgot how it felt".|$|E

40|$|The {{classical}} Wells-Riley {{model for}} predicting risk of airborne transmission of diseases assumes a uniform {{spatial distribution of}} the infected cases in an enclosed space. A new mathematical model is developed here for predicting the spatial distribution of infection risk of airborne transmitted diseases by integrating the Wells-Riley equation into computational fluid dynamics. We applied our new integrated model to analyze a large nosocomial SARS outbreak in Hong Kong during the 2003 SARS epidemics, which was studied in the literature {{with regard to the}} association between airflow and SARS infection. The predicted numbers of infected cases of medical students in <b>the</b> same <b>cubicle,</b> <b>the</b> adjacent <b>cubicle</b> and <b>the</b> distant <b>cubicle</b> were 6. 39, 0. 78 and 0. 2 respectively while the observed numbers of infected medical students in <b>the</b> three <b>cubicles</b> were 7, 0 and 0 respectively during the morning of March 6 th, which was the highest attack period. The predicted numbers of infected cases of inpatients during the morning of March 6 th in <b>the</b> same <b>cubicle,</b> <b>the</b> adjacent cubic and <b>the</b> distance <b>cubicle</b> were 7. 8, 5. 1, and 4. 8 respectively which also agree well with the observed distribution of the infected inpatients during the entire infection period. The new developed model provides a new modelling tool for investigating the airborne transmission of diseases in enclosed spaces. The model is applicable when the susceptible stays mostly at the same location in an enclosed space during the infectious period, such as inpatients in a hospital ward, passengers in an airplane etc. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

500|$|The {{video is}} similar in {{thematic}} content to Mötley Crüe's video for the single [...] "Girls, Girls, Girls". But in contrast, this video tells the story from Madonna's point of view. [...] She looks down into <b>the</b> <b>cubicles</b> {{to make eye contact}} with the men but they are unable to return it. She also looks assertively into the camera, making eye contact with the viewer. With these scenes Madonna portrays her holding power over the men and the ability to pursue them. Madonna represents an assertive woman searching for a lover who can accept her as a human being. Author Bruce Forbes notes that the men in <b>the</b> <b>cubicles</b> are proved unworthy of her and there is an undertone of mockery when Madonna addresses them as 'baby' while shaking her body.|$|R

40|$|AbstractNowadays, European {{policies}} are promoting low energy buildings {{because of the}} high amount of energy consumption of the building sector. Phase change materials (PCM) have been studied in building implementation as a passive system to reduce the energy demand. Based in the experience obtained in the experimental set-up of Puigverd de Lleida (Spain), this paper pretends to analyze experimentally the PCM performance in a scenario with internal thermal gains. The experiments were done in three different <b>cubicles</b> with <b>the</b> same internal dimensions. The selection of the constructive systems used in these three <b>cubicles</b> allows <b>the</b> authors to evaluate the impact of using PCM in a typical Mediterranean building. A domestic heat pump for summer and an electric radiator for winter were installed to control the internal temperature of <b>the</b> <b>cubicles.</b> <b>The</b> results of summer period experiments show that <b>the</b> PCM <b>cubicle</b> stored <b>the</b> heat produced by the internal loads limiting the heat dissipation to the outer environment. Therefore, the energy consumed by the HVAC system of <b>the</b> PCM <b>cubicle</b> during <b>the</b> cooling period is higher than that of <b>the</b> other <b>cubicles</b> that dissipated <b>the</b> thermal loads according to the thermal resistance of their envelopes. Therefore, the PCM selection should take into account not only the comfort temperature but also the activity and functionality of the building...|$|R

40|$|A nuclear {{criticality}} {{safety analysis}} has been performed to increase the approved plutonium mass limit for cans stored in Vault {number_sign} 4 <b>cubicles</b> at PFP. <b>The</b> original CSER 96 - 025 accommodated the storage of 4. 4 kg of plutonium in PuO, (5. 0 kg PuO,) in Vault {number_sign} 4 by requiring that half <b>the</b> <b>cubicles</b> be left vacant. This addendum allows for all <b>the</b> <b>cubicles</b> to be used, but with a fissile plutonium mass limit of 58 kg per cubicle. A mass limit for each cubical allows for storage of {{a larger number of}} cans if some have less than the 4. 4 kg Pu limit per can. The highest k., calculated is 0. 932 + 0. 003 when an overbatched can is present in every fourth cubicle. This is below the criticality safety limit of kff 0. 935, and consequently, an increase of plutonium mass to 4. 4 kg per can is within acceptable safety limits for the given mass limit...|$|R
