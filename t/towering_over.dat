5|$|The Pairan aliens were {{designed}} by the prominent avant-garde artist Tarō Okamoto, which used a single eye that is common among science fiction aliens. Although official film posters showed the Pairan aliens <b>towering</b> <b>over</b> buildings, the actual cinematic version of the aliens were {{on the scale of}} humans, at about two meters. Walt Lee reports that Gentaro Nakajima's novel, on which this film was based, was in turn based on the Japanese folktale Kaguya-hime. The film was one of fourteen Japanese color pictures produced in early 1956, but the first color Japanese science-fiction film.|$|E
5|$|Madre de Deus entered Dartmouth harbor on 7 September, <b>towering</b> <b>over</b> {{the other}} ships and the town's small houses as it sailed by. The only vessel {{guarding}} the great ship was Roebuck, {{as the other}} vessels had slipped off to Portsmouth to sell {{off some of the}} plunder. Nothing like Madre had ever been seen in England - the frame from the beakhead to the stern was 165 feet long. The breadth at the broadest deck, was just over 46 feet and her draft was twenty-six feet at her arrival in Dartmouth. Her several decks; consisted of a main orlop, three main decks, and a forecastle and a spar deck of two floors each. The length of the keel was 100 feet, the main-mast was 121 feet, and its circumference at the partners was just over ten feet. The main-yard was 106 feet long.|$|E
5|$|<b>Towering</b> <b>over</b> the Rhine valley, the Godesburg's {{strategic}} position commanded the roads leading {{to and from}} Bonn, the Elector of Cologne's capital city, and Cologne, the region's economic powerhouse. Over time, the Electors strengthened its walls and heightened its towers. They added a small residence in the 14th century and the donjon (also called a Bergfried or keep) developed as a stronghold of the Electoral archives and valuables. By the mid-16th century, the Godesburg was considered nearly impregnable and had {{become a symbol of}} the dual power of the Prince-electors and Archbishops of Cologne, one of the wealthiest ecclesiastical territories in the Holy Roman Empire. The Cologne War, a feud between the Protestant Elector, Gebhard, Truchsess of Waldburg, and the Catholic Elector, Ernst of Bavaria, was yet another schismatic episode in the Electoral and archdiocesan history.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Chicago Mayor Harold Washington {{approved}} a $24million subsidy to FJV Venture to develop Block 37. There were {{a series of}} subsequent alternate redevelopment plans. Among the prior redevelopment plans for the block were the original Block 37 Towers, for which the original block was demolished and which included a 47-story tower designed by Murphy/Jahn, Inc. Another failed plan was a Solomon Cordwell Buenz plan including a 711-foot 66-story residential tower and a 12-story Marriott Hotel <b>towering</b> <b>over</b> a 4-story retail base. This had followed the 39-story Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates design scheduled for 2004 completion. The developments fell through, which put the property back into the city's possession. In 2002, the city initiated a competition for the development rights to the property. In 2004, the city sold the property to Mills Corp. at a $20million loss. Mills sold the development rights to Joseph Freed and Associates in 2005, when the city committed $42million in tax-increment funding. In 2007, the city learned the development was $150million over budget. The complex was originally being developed by commercial real estate developer Mills Corporation, {{best known for its}} ownership of numerous super-regional shopping malls. However, Joseph Freed and Associates LLC has inherited the development rights.|$|E

25|$|Ta Dzong, {{the watch}} tower, {{that was in}} the past a stronghold against {{internal}} insurgencies, <b>towering</b> <b>over</b> {{the east side of the}} dzong, has since been converted into a state-of-the Art Museum (National Museum) with technical and financial support provided by Austria. The tower also houses a chapel dedicated to the Jigme Namgyal who was penlop in the 19th century. It is also stated that in the dungeon of the tower two British soldiers were imprisoned during the Duar War. The Ta Dzong tower originally was a highly fortified six-storied tower, with numerous galleries in the thick walls for defense. Further fortifications in the form of three independent towers were added at a higher elevation in close vicinity of the Ta Dzong.|$|E
25|$|In Bernini’s sculpture, you see Neptune <b>towering</b> <b>over</b> Triton. He {{appears to}} be a man in his early thirties, with a beard and wavy locks. Neptune has his legs spread apart and is {{balancing}} on a large seashell that carries both himself and Triton. Neptune only has a large sheet covering his right shoulder and gliding in between his legs, revealing parts of the male anatomy. The anatomy of the entire body is defined and the twisting of his torso gives him a more trimmed outline of his muscles, allowing the viewer to pay particular attention to his muscles and how they are contracted or relaxed in his state of movement. While standing, Neptune also holds a trident downward in motion that makes it look like he is about to thrust it at someone. “(H)e turns his angry look towards the water, which gushes forth at his feet, imposing his command by thrusting down with his trident.” His arms are tense, forcefully gripping it to dictate his divine power. There is an implication of wind in the long sheet and Neptune’s hair drift backwards, aiding the illusion of reality.|$|E

500|$|In Washington, {{the company}} was {{quartered}} in the Ladies' Gallery of the Senate Chamber, in the Capitol.

While they were lodged at the Capitol, President Lincoln, Secretary of State William H. Seward, and Secretary of War Simon Cameron visited. Bosbyshell recalled Lincoln, [...] "yes, here, <b>towering</b> <b>over</b> all in the room was the great central figure of the war. I remember how I was impressed by the kindliness of his face and awkward hanging of his arms and legs, his apparent bashfulness in the presence of these first soldiers of the Republic, and with it all a grave, rather mournful bearing in his attitude." ...|$|E

500|$|Bader {{observes that}} Look Mickey is {{concerned}} {{both with the}} artistic process and Lichtenstein's new painting techniques. He believes it {{can be considered a}} self-portrait {{in the sense that it}} [...] "explicitly situates the painting's maker himself within the self-enclosed narcissistic circuit at its center". The painting shows Donald looking into the reflective water at Lichtenstein's blue 'rfl' signature [...] "as a kind of surrogate for the image's creator", in a manner that is reminiscent of Caravaggio's Narcissus, in which the subject gazes at his own reflection on the water. This is viewed as an allegory of Lichtenstein's position as an artist trained to develop his realist instincts despite the prominence of abstract expressionism. When viewed this way, Mickey serves as the [...] "vanguard modernist" [...] superego <b>towering</b> <b>over</b> Lichtenstein and laughing at his retrograde efforts.|$|E
500|$|The stark {{black-and-white}} cover {{photo was}} {{taken on the}} main lawn at Friar Park by Wilkes' Camouflage Productions partner, Barry Feinstein. Commentators interpret the photograph – showing Harrison seated in the centre of, and <b>towering</b> <b>over,</b> four comical-looking garden gnomes – as representing his removal from the Beatles' collective identity. The gnomes had recently been delivered to Friar Park and placed on the lawn; seeing the four figures there, and mindful of the message in the album's title, Feinstein immediately drew parallels with Harrison's former band. Author and music journalist Mikal Gilmore has written that Lennon's initial negativity regarding All Things Must Pass was possibly because he was [...] "irritated" [...] by this cover photo; Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley attributes this reaction to envy on Lennon's part {{during a time when}} [...] "everything [...] touched turned to gold".|$|E
