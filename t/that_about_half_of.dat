5|$|It is {{not exactly}} known how many Jews were helped by Żegota, but {{at one point in}} 1943 it had 2,500 Jewish {{children}} under its care in Warsaw alone. At the end of the war, Sendler attempted to locate their parents but nearly all of them had died at Treblinka. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Jews who survived the war (thus over 50,000) were aided in some shape or form by Żegota.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN states <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the {{estimated}} total population lives in protected areas and 30% on private land. Protected areas that support major populations include Omo (Ethiopia), Serengeti, Katavi, Ruaha and Selous-Kilombero (Tanzania), Kafue and North Luangwa (Zambia), Nyika (Malawi), Etosha (Namibia), Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (Botswana/South Africa) and Ukhahlamba Drakensberg Park (South Africa). Most of these populations {{appear to be}} stable. Relatively large numbers of common eland now live on private land, particularly in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, reflecting its value as a trophy animal. Common elands have also been widely domesticated in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Kenya, {{as well as in}} Russia and Ukraine.|$|E
5|$|During {{the era of}} the {{collodion}} process, {{before the}} arrival of less demanding photographic technology (the gelatin silver process, photographic film, and smaller cameras) and the consequent rise of amateur photography, commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views. In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more significant because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.|$|E

The government estimated in 1995 that only 230 of the country's 8,000 industrial enterprises were following pollution control standards.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} of mitempfindung {{is difficult to}} determine exactly, because many individuals would not be aware of having referred itch until the phenomenon is explained to them. Consequently, variability exists within the scientific literature as to the actual {{prevalence of}} referred itch in humans. Mittelmann (1920) has reported that 8 out of 9 people questioned experienced referred sensations.

25|$|The {{two major}} {{risk factors for}} esophageal squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} are tobacco (smoking or chewing) and alcohol. The combination of tobacco and alcohol has a strong synergistic effect. Some data suggest <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> all cases are due to tobacco and about one-third to alcohol, while over three-quarters of the cases in men are due to the combination of smoking and heavy drinking. Risks associated with alcohol appear {{to be linked to}} its aldehyde metabolite and to mutations in certain related enzymes. Such metabolic variants are relatively common in Asia.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} to single-man operation meant <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the company's workforce was suddenly surplus.

There was a company union, although it hadn't done much good. By October 1933, the workers had gained backing from Minnesota Governor Floyd B. Olson, St. Paul Mayor William Mahoney and the National Recovery Administration, among others. The next year, the workers voted to join the Amalgamated Transit Union.|$|E

25|$|The term bondage {{describes}} {{the practice of}} physical restraint. Bondage is usually, but not always, a sexual practice. While bondage is a very popular variation within the larger field of BDSM, it is nevertheless sometimes differentiated {{from the rest of}} this field. Studies among BDSM practitioners in the US have shown <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> all men find the idea of bondage to be erotic; and many women do as well. Strictly speaking, bondage means binding the partner by tying their appendages together; for example, by the use of handcuffs or ropes, or by lashing their arms to an object. Bondage can also be achieved by spreading the appendages and fastening them with chains or ropes to a St. Andrew's cross or spreader bars.|$|E
25|$|There is not {{sufficient}} data to establish the safety of spinal manipulations, {{and the rate of}} adverse events is unknown. Spinal manipulation is frequently associated with mild to moderate temporary adverse effects, and also rare serious outcomes which can result in permanent disability or death.

Adverse events are increasingly reported in randomized clinical trials of spinal manipulation but remain under–reported despite recommendations in the 2010 CONSORT guidelines.

25|$|While {{opposed to}} {{interfaith}} marriage in principle, {{officials of the}} major Reform rabbinical organisation, the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), estimated in 2012 <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> their rabbis partake in such ceremonies. The need {{to cope with this}} phenomenon – 80% of all Reform-raised Jews in the United States wed between 2000 and 2013 were intermarried – led to the recognition of patrilineal descent: all children born to a couple in which a single member was Jewish, whether mother or father, was accepted as a Jew on condition that they received corresponding education and committed themselves as such. Conversely, offspring of a Jewish mother only are not accepted if they do not demonstrate affinity to the faith. A Jewish status is conferred unconditionally only on the children of two Jewish parents.|$|E

Samsung initially stated that the space was required for the S4's new features, but following a report regarding the issue on the BBC series Watchdog, Samsung stated that it would review the possibility of optimising the S4's operating system to use less local drive space in a future update. Storage optimizations were brought in an update first released in June 2013, which frees 80MB of internal storage and restores {{the ability to move}} apps to the device's microSD card.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{during the}} nineteenth {{and most of the}} twentieth century, new plesiosaurs were {{described}} at a rate of three or four genera each decade, the pace suddenly picked up in the 1990s, with seventeen plesiosaurs being discovered in this period. The tempo of discovery accelerated in the early twenty-first century, with about three or four plesiosaurs being named each year. This implies <b>that</b> <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the known plesiosaurs are relatively new to science, a result of a far more intense field research. Some of this is taking place away from the traditional areas, e.g. in new sites developed in New Zealand, Argentina, Norway, Japan, China and Morocco, but the locations of the more original discoveries have proven to be still productive, with important new finds in England and Germany. Some of the new genera are a renaming of already known species, which were deemed sufficiently different to warrant a separate genus name.|$|E
