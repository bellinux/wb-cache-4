50|$|Slick tyres are not {{suitable}} for use on common road vehicles, which {{must be able to}} operate in all weather conditions. They are used in auto racing where competitors can choose different tyres based on the weather conditions and can often change tyres during a race. Slick tyres provide far more <b>traction</b> than grooved <b>tyres</b> on dry roads, due to their greater contact area but typically have far less <b>traction</b> than grooved <b>tyres</b> under wet conditions. Wet roads severely diminish the traction because of aquaplaning due to water trapped between the tyre contact area and the road surface. Grooved tyres are designed to remove water from the contact area through the grooves, thereby maintaining traction even in wet conditions.|$|R
40|$|Design {{solution}} {{of a novel}} mobile robot navigation system, presented here, is used to control robot&# 039;s locomotion across slippery surfaces. Usually, motion control strategies, are based on assumption of sufficient <b>traction</b> between <b>tyres</b> and the road. Motion across slippery surfaces can endanger the robot and its surroundings. Our solution combines Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) measurements with odometry data. It performs well on any surface, regardless of sensing, localization and navigation errors, within an indoor environment, in real-time. An accelerated feature detection method is used to improve LIDAR localization update rate and improve localization accuracy. Experiments conducted validate proposed approach...|$|R
50|$|Indoor races {{consist of}} either a {{polished}} concrete floor with coke syrup or other media sprayed or mopped onto the concrete for <b>traction</b> for the <b>tyres</b> of the motorcycles, or on dirt {{that has been}} moistened and hard packed, or left loose (often called a cushion). Similar to size of the Arenacross Arenas or sometimes smaller the riders must have accurate throttle control to negotiate these tight Indoor Race Tracks.|$|R
50|$|It {{appeared}} that the more experienced Alonso would eventually regain the lead, but Maldonado withstood the pressure and eventually Alonso decided to settle for second, rather than risk losing any more <b>traction</b> on his <b>tyres.</b> Räikkönen's late surge proved insufficient to take second place. The win for Maldonado was his first in Formula One and eclipsed his previous best result - 8th in China. In fact it was only his third ever points scoring finish in 24 races. It was also Williams best result since the 2004 Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|R
25|$|Indeed, all ESC {{manufacturers}} {{emphasize that}} the system is not a performance enhancement nor a replacement for safe driving practices, but rather a safety technology to assist the driver in recovering from dangerous situations. ESC does not increase traction, so it does not enable faster cornering (although it can facilitate better-controlled cornering). More generally, ESC works within inherent limits of the vehicle's handling and available <b>traction</b> between the <b>tyres</b> and road. A reckless maneuver can still exceed these limits, resulting in loss of control. For example, in a severe hydroplaning scenario, the wheels that ESC would use to correct a skid may not even initially be in contact with the road, reducing its effectiveness.|$|R
50|$|The Revelation {{model was}} an Australian {{special edition of}} the RX8 with a 1000 car limited {{production}} run. The model incorporated the top spec features of the current RX8 with the 9 speaker Bose sound system, leather seats and with the same 13B Renesis rotary engine. Like regular RX-8 variants, the Revelation features 18-inch alloy wheels and <b>tyres,</b> <b>traction</b> control, Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), six airbags, cruise control, power windows/mirrors, limited-slip differential, six-CD in-dash audio system and climate control air-conditioning. The revelation though, added stiffer anti roll bars, foam filled cross members and special edition grey spoke alloys. The Revelation also offered new colors {{such as the new}} Mazda Galaxy Grey, Phantom Blue, Copper Red, Brilliant Black and white pearl.|$|R
5|$|Nokian Tyres {{manufactures}} {{truck and}} bus tyres sold under the Nokian Hakkapeliitta brand. Steer, <b>traction,</b> and trailer <b>tyres</b> are marketed. Nokian Heavy Tyres Ltd is {{a manufacturer of}} special tyres for forestry, industrial machinery, and agriculture. Its products are sold as original equipment as well on the replacement tyre market. Nokian Tyres produces a number of product lines, including the Tractor Industrial 2 and Country King. Nokian Tyres is a world market leader in forestry tyres, which are a key product of the Nokian Heavy Tyres subsidiary. Nokian forestry tyres include the Skidder and Cut-To-Length model lines. The Skidder tyres have a 25 degree bar angle and the Cut-To-Length tyres have a 35 degree bar angle. Bar angle is a tyre tread measurement. Smaller bar angles are associated with higher traction {{at the expense of}} increased mud accumulation.|$|R
40|$|The MacPherson active {{suspension}} system {{is able to}} support the weight of vehicle and vibration isolation from road profile, and is also able to maintain the <b>traction</b> between <b>tyre</b> and road surface. It also provides both additional stability and maneuverability by performing active roll and pitch control during cornering and braking, and the most significant are ride comfort and road handling performance. However, a drawback of MacPherson model is the self-steer phenomenon in the {{active suspension}} system. The problem might be solved by controlling the actuator force and control arm of the system. The MacPherson model has a similar layout to a real vehicle active suspension system. The mathematical model of the system produces a nonlinear mathematical model with uncertainties. Therefore, the proposed control strategy {{must be able to}} cater the uncertainties in mathematical model and simultaneously provide a fast response to the system. The control strategy combines Composite Nonlinear Feedback (CNF) algorithm and Proportional Integral Sliding Mode Control (PISMC) algorithm to achieve quick response and to reduce uncertainties. Optimisation of parameters in the CNF was performed using Evolutionary Strategy (ES) algorithm for fast transient performance. Thus, the controller is called Proportional Integral Sliding Mode Control – Evolutionary Strategy – Composite Nonlinear Feedback (PISMC-ES-CNF). To validate the proposed controller, the conventional Sliding Mode Control (SMC) and CNF were utilised to control the system under various road profiles. The ISO 2631 - 1, 1997 was used as a reference of ride comfort level for the acceleration of sprung mass. Results show that the proposed controller, PISMC-ES-CNF achieved the best control performance under various road profiles. The results obtained also prove that the PISMC-ES-CNF managed to improve ride comfort quality and road handling quality and has also delivered better control performance in terms of transient response of acceleration of sprung mass, reducing overshoot and chattering problem compared to conventional SMC and CNF...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Common vehicle always {{experience}} {{energy loss}} during cornering manoeuver. Thus, to ensure {{it did not}} happened especially at high speed, a study of torque vectoring and traction control {{need to be made}} since it can increase the <b>traction</b> control of <b>tyres</b> during cornering at high speed. The study of torque vectoring and traction control for an all-wheel drive electric vehicle was conducted by modelling an all-wheel drive electric vehicle (EV) in ADAMS/Car software. In addition, an optimal control algorithm will be developed for best performance to minimize energy losses using MATLAB/Simulink software. Furthermore, to prove the effectiveness of the all-wheel drive electric, the torque and traction control simulation of the all-wheel drive electric vehicle will be compared with uncontrolled electric vehicle model. According to the result, torque vectoring and traction control of in-wheel motor in all wheel drive EV can help to increase the performance of the electric vehicle during cornering manoeuver. In conclusion, this study of torque vectoring and traction control for an all-wheel drive electric vehicle will help researchers to improve the design of the future electric vehicle in term of the vehicle performance during cornering manoeuvre. ...|$|R
25|$|Grosjean {{stopped on}} track near a fire marshal with smoke bellowing from his engine on lap 65 {{and became the}} race's second (and final) retirement. Hülkenberg passed Magnussen for eighth on lap 68, while Räikkönen lost <b>traction</b> in his <b>tyres</b> {{at the bottom of}} the hill heading towards the Senna cichane, {{allowing}} teammate Alonso to pass him for sixth on the same lap. Hamilton pressured Rosberg and reduced the time deficit to his teammate to be 0.8 seconds behind at the start of the 71st (and final) lap, but Hamilton was unable to get close enough to affect an overtaking manoeuvre and Rosberg crossed the start/finish line first to win the race. Massa finished third, with Button in fourth and Vettel fifth. Alonso took sixth ahead of teammate Räikkönen, Hülkenberg was eighth, and Magnussen secured ninth. Bottas fended off an challenge from Kvyat in the final laps to secure the final points-scoring position of tenth. Maldonado, Vergne, Gutiérrez, Pérez and Sutil were the last of the classified finishers. It was Rosberg's fifth victory of the season, his first in Brazil, and the eighth of his career. Mercedes's one-two finish was their eleventh of the season, braking the previous record held by McLaren since 1988 with Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna. It was also the team's 15th victory of the year, equalling the record jointly held by McLaren and Ferrari. There were seven lead changes in the race: three drivers reached the front of the field. Rosberg led four times for a total of 59 laps, more than any other driver.|$|R
50|$|Sport Street tyres are for {{aggressive}} street riders that {{spend most of}} their time carving corners on public roadways. These tyres do not have a long life, but in turn have better traction in high speed cornering. Street and sport street <b>tyres</b> have good <b>traction</b> even when cold, but when warmed too much, can actually lose traction as their internal temperature increases.Track or Slick tyres are for track days or races. They may have more of a triangular profile, which in turn gives a larger contact patch while leaned over. These tyres are not recommended for the street by manufactures, and are known to have a shorter life on the street. Due to the triangulation of the tyre, there will be less contact patch in the centre, causing the tyre to develop a flat spot quicker when used to ride on straightaways for long periods of time and have no tread so they lose almost all grip in the wet. Racing slicks are always made of a softer rubber compound and do not provide as much <b>traction</b> as street <b>tyres</b> until warmed to a higher internal temperature than street tyres normally operate at. Most street riding will not put a sufficient amount of friction on the tyre to maintain the slick's optimal tyre temperature, especially in colder climates and in spring and fall.Off road tyres have knobby, deep treads for maximum grip on loose dirt, mud, sand, or gravel; such tyres tend to be less stable on paved surfaces.|$|R
40|$|The use of snow tyres in New Zealand is {{becoming}} more common due to lower priced late model second hand passenger cars being imported fitted with older half worn snow tyres. Inappropriate use of snow tyres has been anecdotally linked {{to a number of}} serious and fatal crashes nationally. A primary consideration for crash investigators is to establish whether or not the use of the snow tyres contributed to the cause of those crashes. This paper describes comparative testing of snow tyres and conventional tyres for both wet and dry road surfaces. Testing was undertaken for both cornering and straight line emergency braking. The tests were performed by NZ Police Serious Crash Unit staff. Preliminary test results indicated a significant reduction in <b>traction</b> for snow <b>tyres</b> when compared to conventional car tyres during cornering manoeuvres, and a considerable increase in stopping distances on wet surfaces under emergency braking situations. An analysis of the results from initial testing showed a reduction in cornering (lateral) traction of around 6. 0 % on a dry road and 9. 2 % in the wet. Regarding stopping distances under emergency braking, in the dry there was a reduction in stopping distance of around 13. 1 %, but an increase in stopping distance in the wet of 16. 0 %. This equates to an increase in stopping distance on a wet road surface of about 2. 6 metres at 50 km/h and about 10. 6 metres at a speed of 100 km/h. The research, although limited in extent, show that snow tyres do not offer as much grip as can be achieved with conventional tyres, particularly in wet conditions and also during cornering in wet or dry road conditions. Further testing is required to determine if the age of the snow tyres and/or the road surface type will {{have an effect on the}} results (asphalt, bitumen chip etc). This testing should clarify the relationship between tyre type, tread depth and friction...|$|R
