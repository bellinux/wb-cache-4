5|$|While {{these attacks}} were in {{progress}} on its right, the 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, on September 4 attacked and captured Hill 303. The {{next day it}} had difficulty in holding the hill against counterattacks. By September 4 it had become clear that the NK 3rd Division {{in front of the}} 5th and 7th Cavalry Regiments was also attacking, and despite continued air strikes, artillery preparations, and infantry efforts on Hill 518, it was infiltrating large numbers of its troops <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attacking US forces. That night large North Korean forces came through the gap between the 3rd Battalion on the southern slope of Hill 518 and the 2nd Battalion westward. The North Koreans turned west and occupied Hill 464 in force. By September 5, Hill 464 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US 7th Cavalry had more North Koreans on it than Hill 518 to its front. The North Koreans cut the Waegwan to Tabu-dong road east of the regiment so that its communications with other US units now were only to the west. During the day the 7th Cavalry made a limited withdrawal on Hill 518, giving up on capturing the hill.|$|E
5|$|According to Luttwak, {{the forward}} defence system was always {{vulnerable}} to unusually large barbarian concentrations of forces, as the Roman army was too thinly spread along the enormous borders {{to deal with}} such threats. In addition, the lack of any reserves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> border entailed that a barbarian force that successfully penetrated the perimeter defences would have unchallenged ability to rampage deep into the empire before Roman reinforcements from other border garrisons could arrive to intercept them.|$|E

With ammunition exploding among the burning wreckage a number of Australians rushed to aid the injured, scrambling through the debris and removing the unexploded ammunition and pulling the survivors to safety.

5|$|Berkeley House on Piccadilly {{was named}} after John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton who had {{purchased}} its land, and that surrounding it, shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. In 1696, the Berkeley family sold the house and grounds to the 1st Duke of Devonshire (who renamed it Devonshire House) on the proviso that {{the view from the}} rear of the house should not be spoiled. Berkeley Square was laid out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house in the 1730s; because of the conditions of sale, houses were only built on the east and west sides of it. The west side still has various mid-18th century buildings along it, while the east side now contains offices including Berkeley Square House.|$|E

5|$|By September, several Blenheims were {{equipped}} {{with what was}} now officially known as AI Mk. I and training of the crews began with No. 25 Squadron at RAF Northolt. Robert Hanbury Brown, a physicist who would later work on radar in the US, and Keith Wood joined them in August 1939, helping fitters keep the systems operational, {{and coming up with}} useful methods for interception. Near the end of August, Dowding visited the base and saw the radars in the nose and pointed out to Bowen that the enemy gunners would see the light from the CRTs and shoot the operator. The sets were re-fitted once again, returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage, which caused more delays.|$|E
5|$|During the argument, {{a scuffle}} ensued between Pandey {{and the group}} of men. He was beaten, gagged and knocked {{unconscious}} with an iron rod. The men then dragged Jyoti <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bus, beating her with the rod and raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. Medical reports later said that she suffered serious injuries to her abdomen, intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage indicated that a blunt object (suspected to be the iron rod) {{may have been used}} for penetration. That rod was later described by police as being a rusted, L-shaped implement of the type used as a wheel jack handle.|$|E

5|$|Hartley {{maintained}} his pole position advantage {{heading into the}} first turn. Lieb passed Tandy to take over second position, while Fässler moved to third, after passing Tandy at the Bus Stop chicane at the first lap's conclusion. Tandy reclaimed third from Fässler shortly afterward. Team SARD Morand held the LMP2 lead before its car was overtaken by Tincknell and Bird on lap two. Duval moved in front of Wurz for fifth and the Toyota driver dropped to seventh. Jota Sport was issued with a drive-through penalty after its car was adjudged to have jumped the start and rejoined in sixth in LMP2, allowing Bird {{to the front of}} the category. Tandy drove to the inside of Estre to lap him, but made head-on contact with his car and went straight into the Pif Paf corner barrier. Both drivers continued, but Tandy drove into the pit lane for repairs, falling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field. Fässler battled with Lieb for second as the two moved through slower traffic, but the Audi driver spun at the Bus Stop chicane allowing Lieb to take over second.
