5|$|During {{the hunting}} trip, Jimbo proclaims Kenny his honorary nephew, {{upsetting}} Stan. When night falls, Cartman {{tells the story}} of Scuzzlebutt, a creature that has a piece of celery in place of one of its hands and Patrick Duffy for a leg. The boys are skeptical, so Cartman decides to dress up as the creature the next morning in order to convince and scare them. When he disappears the next morning, the others set out to find him. They then see Cartman disguised as Scuzzlebutt and start shooting at him. When they catch up with Cartman {{at the base of the}} mountain, Stan tries to shoot him in order to redeem himself in his uncle's eyes. However, he is unable to do so and the delay gives Cartman time to remove the costume. At a lower elevation, Randy orders the South Park residents <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> to divert the lava away from the town.|$|E
500|$|The {{battle is}} named after [...] "trench", or khandaq, that was dug by Muslims in {{preparation}} for the battle. The word khandaq (...) is the Arabised form of the Persian word kandak (meaning [...] "that which has been dug"). Salman farsi the Persian advised Muhammad <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> around the city.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{according}} to Peter Štih and modern scholars, Kronsteiner arguments were plain assumptions which historians can not objectively accept as evidence. Actually, the etymology derivation {{is one of}} many, and is not generally accepted; the Croats are mentioned along the Avars only in the Constantine VII's work, but always as enemies of the Avars, who destroyed and expelled their authority from Dalmatia; those settlements had widespread Slavic suffix ići, the settlements {{do not have the}} semicircular Avar type arrangement, and the Ban's settlements could not be his seat as are very small and are not found on any important crossroad or geographical location; the titles origin and derivation are unsolved, and they are not found among Avars and Avar language; toponyms with root Obrov derive from South Slavic verb [...] "obrovati" [...] (<b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench)</b> and are mostly of later date (from the 14th century).|$|E
5000|$|He {{was made}} Lieutenant in the Robin Hood Rifles in 1881 {{which became the}} 7th (Robin Hood) Battalion of the Sherwood Foresters, taking over command of the Battalion on 31 July 1915 at Hooge when they were ordered <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> new <b>trench</b> and connect the British line {{where it had been}} {{captured}} by the Germans.|$|R
50|$|One type of {{subsoiler}} has a torpedo-shaped tip and {{is called}} a mole plough because the tip describes a path much like the burrow that a mole creates. Mole ploughs are used to create tile drainage, with or without tiles or tile line added. A form of this implement (with a single blade), a pipe-and-cable-laying plough, is used to lay buried cables or pipes, without the need <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> deep <b>trench</b> and re-fill it.|$|R
5000|$|A pipe-and-cable-laying plough or moleplough is a trenchless {{method to}} bury cables or pipes.The {{machinery}} {{is a form}} of a subsoiler with a single blade. It is used to lay buried services of virtually any description, for drainage, water, electricity, telecommunications, gas supply etc.. A coil of the service pipe/cable is mounted on the tractor and is led down a guide behind the blade, and is left buried behind the plough, without the need <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> deep <b>trench</b> and re-fill it.|$|R
60|$|Returning to the camp, Harry sent forty {{men with}} shovels, {{obtained}} in the village, <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench,</b> twelve feet wide, and as deep as they could get for the water, across the track, at the near side of the morass.|$|E
60|$|As night came {{on it was}} {{resolved}} <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> across Soledad Street, so that the two divisions might communicate with each other. This was dangerous work, for the Mexicans kept a strict guard and fired every time a head was exposed to view. The trench was started at each end and was completed long before daybreak. While {{this was going on}} the Mexicans also dug a trench, hoping thereby to catch the Texans in a cross-fire, but the scheme failed.|$|E
60|$|The {{captain and}} {{the men in the}} boat carried the bags high up on the beach, out of any danger from tide or surf, and laid them in a line along the sand. The captain ordered this because {{it would be easier to}} handle them afterwards--if it should ever be {{necessary}} to handle them--than if they had been thrown into piles. If they should conclude to bury them, it would be easier and quicker <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> along the line, and tumble them in, than to make the deep holes that would otherwise be necessary.|$|E

60|$|Then {{they went}} back to the shore. It was {{littered}} thickly with fragments of wreck, casks, boxes, and other articles. Here, too, were nearly a score of the corpses of their shipmates. The first duty was <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> long shallow <b>trench</b> in the sand, beyond high water mark; and in this the bodies of their drowned comrades were laid.|$|R
25|$|The {{prosecutors}} {{presented a}} case that indicated Gacy was sane and fully in control of his actions. To support this contention, they produced several witnesses to testify to the premeditation of Gacy's actions and the efforts he went {{to in order to}} escape detection. Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personality and insanity. Two witnesses who testified were PDM employees, who confessed Gacy had made them dig trenches in his crawl space. One of these employees, David Cram, testified that in August 1977, Gacy had marked a location in the crawl space with sticks and told him <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> drainage <b>trench.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then {{all were}} set to work <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench,</b> three feet deep with {{perpendicular}} sides, {{at a distance of}} two feet from the palisade. A large store of bamboos that had been too slender for use in the palisade were sharpened, and cut into lengths of two feet; and these were planted, thickly, {{in the bottom of the}} trench. Others, five feet long, were sharpened and then thrust through the interstices between the upright bamboos; the ends being fixed firmly in the ground inside, while the sharpened points projected like a row of bayonets, at a height of some two feet above the edge of the ditch.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSurface {{subsidence}} {{resulting from}} the collapse of underground cavities, whether natural or man-made can interact with existing buildings on the surface. One of the mitigation measures used is <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> peripheral <b>trench</b> at <b>a</b> certain distance from the structure, filled with a soft material, like peat, or artificial material. This is thought to reduce the horizontal strain applied to the structure. The 3 D numerical analysis {{presented in this paper}} is a first step towards evaluating the efficiency of this type of mitigation technique. The numerical model developed using Abaqus allows the effect of various parameters such as the width or depth of the peripheral trench, its distance from the building and/or the stiffness and strength of the filling material to be clearly determined...|$|R

5000|$|In the {{construction}} industry, moling is a trenchless method used to lay pipes. During the moling process, a pneumatically-driven machine {{known as a}} mole forces {{its way through the}} soil along the desired path of the pipe. Moling avoids the need <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> and can be used to lay water pipes and the heating coils of heat pump systems.|$|E
50|$|Pilbeam's money box scheme, {{combined}} with other fundraising projects, resulted in enough money being raised without the council needing to spend anything on the pool, {{with the exception of}} funding the diving board. The first sod of the WWII Memorial Pool was turned during a ceremony on 15 December 1958. Pilbeam declined to use a ceremonial spade to turn a small amount of earth. Instead, he opted to use a bulldozer with <b>a</b> ripper attached <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> deep <b>trench,</b> <b>to</b> mark the start of the project. During the 'turning of the sod' ceremony, he thanked the householders who had generously donated £5,500 via his money box scheme. Employees at local businesses had also raised over £6000 by having small contributions deducted from their wages.|$|R

Later, after his battalion had suffered severe casualties and the Commanding Officer had been wounded, he went {{out in front of}} the advanced position in broad daylight and in full view of the enemy found his Commanding Officer, and brought him back to the new advanced trench over ground swept by machine-gun fire. He not only carried out his original tasks and saved his Commanding Officer, but also assisted in rallying the attacking troops when they were shaken and in leading them forward.|$|R
50|$|Scott {{decided to}} move down to a 40 ft (12 m) crater, which was the largest one nearby. He went down inside it to sample, but found most of the rocks to be too large. Mission Control called up and said they would like the crew <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> to study the soil {{mechanics}} and take a core sample. Irwin dug the trench, which Scott photographed. Then the core sample was taken from inside the crater.|$|E
50|$|With antiaircraft guns {{supplied}} by the Soviet Union, Giap was able to severely restrict {{the ability of the}} French to supply their garrison, forcing them to drop supplies inaccurately from high altitude. Giáp ordered his men <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>a</b> <b>trench</b> system that encircled the French. From the outer trench, other trenches and tunnels were gradually dug inward towards the center. The Viet Minh were now able to move in close to the French troops defending Dien Bien Phu.|$|E

50|$|In the mid-1960s, craft service {{employees}} still operated as general laborers. They {{had also been}} {{put in charge of}} answering the telephone and making coffee. At Universal Studios, they had huge roll-around carts where they would brew coffee. These carts could be shut during takes so that the bubbling machines would not spoil a sound take. There was a dish into which cast and crew members could throw a quarter for their coffee at Universal, not at other studios.
