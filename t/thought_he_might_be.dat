5|$|Back in 1866, as the {{composer}} of The Brandenburgers with its overtones of German military aggression, Smetana <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> {{targeted by the}} invading Prussians, so he absented himself from Prague until hostilities ceased. He returned in September, and almost immediately achieved a long-standing ambition—appointment as principal conductor of the Provisional Theatre, at an annual salary of 1,200gulden. In {{the absence of a}} body of suitable Czech opera, Smetana in his first season presented standard works by Weber, Mozart, Donizetti, Rossini and Glinka, with a revival of his own Bartered Bride. The quality of Smetana's production of Glinka's A Life for the Tsar angered Glinka's champion Mily Balakirev, who expressed himself forcefully. This caused prolonged hostility between the two men. On 16May 1868 Smetana, representing Czech musicians, helped to lay the foundation stone for the future National Theatre; he had written a Festive Overture for the occasion. That same evening Smetana's third opera, Dalibor, was premièred at Prague's New Town Theatre. Although its initial reception was warm its reviews were poor, and Smetana resigned himself to its failure.|$|E
25|$|Jo Grant (now Jo Jones) {{returned}} in two episodes {{of the fourth}} series of The Sarah Jane Adventures in Death of the Doctor (2010), meeting her replacement companion Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) for the first time, and subsequently the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith). The two attend {{a memorial service for}} the Doctor, but later learn aliens faked his death in order to steal the TARDIS using Jo and Sarah Jane's memories. Jo is still married, and travels with her grandson Santiago (Finn Jones); she is envious of Sarah Jane for having had several Doctor encounters since her departure, but has herself led a fulfilling life travelling the world promoting humanitarian and ecological causes. After returning her to London, the Doctor discloses to Jo that he secretly visited her at a time he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> dying.|$|E

[...] "Haven" [...] began filming twenty {{years to the day}} after Compton filmed his scenes in [...] "The Doomsday Machine". Dennis McCarthy composed the music for [...] "Haven", which was so strongly disliked by executive producer Rick Berman that McCarthy <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> fired. [...] "Haven" [...] was the fifth episode to be filmed, but was broadcast as the eleventh episode.|$|E

500|$|Romney himself <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> branded a [...] "loser for life" [...] and {{fade into}} an obscurity like Michael Dukakis (a similar figure with no obvious base of {{political}} support {{who had lost}} what his party considered a winnable presidential election) but, {{to the surprise of}} many political observers, that did not happen. Romney re-emerged onto the political scene {{in the run-up to the}} 2014 U.S. midterm elections, endorsing, campaigning, and fundraising for a number of Republican candidates, especially those running for the U.S. Senate.|$|E
500|$|Reines had {{prepared}} {{for the possibility of}} measuring the distant events of a supernova explosion. Supernova explosions are rare, but Reines <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> lucky enough to see one in his lifetime, and be able to catch the neutrinos streaming from it in his specially-designed detectors. During his wait for a supernova to explode, he put signs on some of his large neutrino detectors, calling them [...] "Supernova Early Warning Systems". In 1987, neutrinos emitted from Supernova SN1987A were detected by the Irvine–Michigan–Brookhaven (IMB) Collaboration, which used an 8,000 ton Cherenkov detector located in a salt mine near Cleveland. [...] Normally, the detectors recorded only a few background events each day. The supernova registered 19 events in just ten seconds. This discovery is regarded as inaugurating the field of neutrino astronomy.|$|E
500|$|McCain also harshly criticized Obama for {{scrapping}} {{construction of}} the U.S. missile defense complex in Poland, declined to enter negotiations over climate change legislation similar {{to what he had}} proposed in the past, and strongly opposed the Obama health care plan. McCain led a successful filibuster of a measure that would allow repeal of the military's [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy towards gays. Factors involved in McCain's new direction included Senate staffers leaving, a renewed concern over national debt levels and the scope of federal government, a possible Republican primary challenge from conservatives in 2010, and McCain's campaign edge being slow to wear off. As one longtime McCain advisor said, [...] "A lot of people, including me, <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> the Republican building bridges to the Obama Administration. But he's been more like the guy blowing up the bridges." ...|$|E

500|$|Enquiries {{continued}} for many months. The bishop was initially reluctant {{to pursue the}} case—Davidson <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> prepared to replace the charges with a lesser one of indiscipline. In February 1932 Dashwood advised Pollock that the matter could not be suppressed in this way; allegations had been printed in the Evening News on 1 February, and the story had been picked up by other papers whose lurid headlines had created much public interest. On 7 February the bishop {{received a letter from}} a 17-year-old girl, Barbara Harris, which contained specific allegations of immoral conduct against Davidson and promised more: [...] "I know lots of things against him that might help you... He has the keys of a lot of girls' flats and front doors." [...] This letter is described by Matthew Parris in his account of the case as [...] "a masterpiece of vituperation"; [...] Davidson's lawyers failed to identify some obvious differences between the handwriting in the letter and other examples of Harris's writing, a factor which might have affected the impact of her subsequent testimony to the court.|$|E
500|$|After {{about three}} months spent in the Tower, on Saturday 3 May 1606 Garnet was {{strapped}} to a wooden hurdle and taken by three horses to the churchyard of St Paul's. He wore a black cloak over his clothes and hat, and {{spent much of the}} journey with his hands together and eyes closed. Present in the churchyard were the Sheriff of London, Sir Henry Montague, George Abbot and John Overal. When asked if he had knowledge of any further treasons, Garnet replied that he had nothing to say. He rejected any entreatments to abandon his faith for Protestantism, and said that he had committed no offence against the king. [...] The only thing he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> condemned for was for abiding by the terms of the confessional, and if by that action he had offended the king or state, he asked for forgiveness. The recorder announced that this was an admission of guilt, but Garnet reiterated his not guilty plea and continued to argue the point.|$|E
500|$|For the 1970 U.S. Senate {{election}} from Michigan, state Republicans {{were looking}} for someone to run against Democrat Philip Hart, a two-term incumbent. [...] Hart was heavily favored to win re-election, but Republicans <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> vulnerable on ideological grounds (for being too liberal) and owing to an anti-war protest arrest involving his wife. [...] George Romney's name was mentioned as a possible candidate. Indeed, Nixon, who never had good relations with Romney either personally or on policy grounds, had by then decided he wanted Romney out of his administration but did not want to fire him, and hatched a plot to get Romney to run in the Senate race. [...] However, George {{came up with the idea}} of Lenore running, and sprung it on Lenore and the children at the end of 1969. [...] Lenore's name began being mentioned by other Republicans, even though she professed not to want to run unless no other candidate could be found. [...] U.S. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford from Michigan thought she could unite the state party's different factions, but Governor William Milliken, who had succeeded George and was not eager to see more Romneys in power, opposed the notion. [...] And while Lenore had achieved a good reputation for campaigning on her husband's behalf, there were some who suspected that her Senate candidacy was just a stalking horse for keeping George's options open. [...] Such sentiments were exacerbated when George did not completely rule himself out of a possible race.|$|E

500|$|Before the 1946 season, Feller {{signed a}} $50,000 {{contract}} for the year, including a bonus for attendance, as the Indians felt many were attending baseball games primarily to see him; he was offered $100,000 by Jorge Pasquel {{to play in the}} Mexican League, but declined to leave the States again. Feller recorded his second career no-hitter on April 30, 1946, against the New York Yankees. He allowed five walks and struck out 11 Yankees. Feller said of the game, [...] "The no-hitter on opening day in Chicago is the one that gets all the attention. But my no-hitter at Yankee Stadium was against a much better team than the White Sox. There was no comparison. I had to pitch to Tommy Henrich, Charlie Keller and Joe DiMaggio in the ninth inning to get the Yankees out." [...] At one point during the season (as Feller <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> nearing Rube Waddell's AL record for strikeouts), Feller confirmed Waddell's record of 344 strikeouts with the AL office as opposed to 349. In his last appearance of the season on September 29, Feller threw five strikeouts against the Detroit Tigers to set the then-AL single-season strikeout record. During the 1946 season, he registered career-highs in strikeouts (348), games started (42) and games pitched (48), shutouts (10), complete games (36) and innings pitched (377.1)—all major league bests that season. Feller finished 26–15 with an ERA of 2.18, the latter a career-low. Nearly 20 years later, Feller recalled, [...] "For the 1946 season, though, the Indians were so thin in pitching that Boudreau decided I was to pitch every fourth day, regardless of rainouts, open dates, or anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|Grönholm was {{disappointed}} with his race, admitting that he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> able to beat Sordo, if not Loeb. But after having gearbox and tyre problems on , he settled into third place {{and stayed in}} that position to the rally's conclusion. [...] "We got it wrong on the tyre choice, which {{we had to have}} approved by the FIA early in the week," [...] he explained. [...] "We thought it would rain. Harder tyres would have made life easier for us." [...] BP-Ford was also unhappy. Christian Loriaux, the team's Technical Director said, [...] "Having Marcus finish behind Sordo is disappointing. Being behind Loeb is easier to understand, because I didn't expect the C4 to be any slower than the Xsara, and that car had a performance edge over us last year." [...] Petter Solberg also had issues with his tyres throughout the rally. After Subaru switched to es from Pirelli following the 2006 season, and with the shortest break between seasons the WRC had seen, the crews had not had enough time to test the new compounds. The Subarus had had their problems with the Pirellis, too. To protect them from breaking up too quickly the drivers had learned how to look after them, but driving that way on the new brand meant that he could not get the BFs up to temperature and ended up running slower. He finished the rally in sixth place. His teammate Atkinson did not have that problem though, and after fighting with Hirvonen in the final half of the rally, finished in fourth place. [...] "It's been a massive battle, and so much fun to be in a battle with these guys again," [...] he said after being congratulated by Hirvonen. Two drivers in non-manufacturer cars, Gardemeister and Kopecký, finished in seventh and eighth place to receive drivers points.|$|E

Churchill, a Handley Page Hampden bomber pilot, was discovered after the escape hiding in a hay loft. In a 2014 interview at the age of 94, he said he was fairly certain that he had been spared execution because his captors <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> related to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.|$|E

In September 2011, he declared his ambition to stand for the party {{in the future as}} an MP, MEP, or Mayor of London, announcing an intention to stand for the London mayoral election in 2020. When asked on comedy panel show The Last Leg why he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> elected, he replied [...] "Boris Johnson". He is also a republican, believing that Britain should have a democratically elected head of state. He has stated that he is a social democrat, not a socialist.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2012, Krekar {{confirmed}} in the Oslo District Court {{that he had}} issued a twenty-page fatwa against Halabjaee.***** The fatwa was sent to several hundred Islamic scholars around the world.

Krekar compared Halabjaee to Theo van Gogh, the film director who was killed by an Islamist in the Netherlands in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|In 1840 German poetry {{took a more}} {{directly}} political turn when the new Frederick William IV ascended the Prussian throne. Initially it was <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a [...] "popular monarch" [...] and during this honeymoon period of his early reign (1840–42) censorship was relaxed. This {{led to the emergence}} of popular political poets (so-called Tendenzdichter), including Hoffmann von Fallersleben (the author of [...] "Deutschland Über Alles"), Ferdinand Freiligrath and Georg Herwegh. Heine looked down on these writers on aesthetic grounds – they were bad poets in his opinion – but his verse of the 1840s became more political too.|$|E

2500|$|Disturbed at his son's {{participation}} {{in what he}} considered a [...] "useless" [...] endeavor, Landis's father tried to discourage him from racing his bike by giving him extra chores. This left him no time to train during the day, so he would sneak {{out of the house}} at night to train, sometimes at 1 or 2 a.m. and often in the freezing cold. Landis's father received a tip that his son had been going out at night. He did not appreciate his son's passion for cycling and <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> getting into drugs or alcohol. He often followed Landis at a distance {{to make sure he was}} not getting into trouble. Landis' father later became a hearty supporter of his son and considered himself one of Floyd's biggest fans.|$|E
2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who {{was a friend of}} a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E
