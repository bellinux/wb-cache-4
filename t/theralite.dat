50|$|<b>Theralite</b> is the {{intrusive}} {{equivalent of}} nepheline basanite, a foidal basalt with essential calic plagioclase and essential olivine. Tephrite is foidal basalt with essential calic plagioclase but without essential olivine. It {{is essentially the}} volcanic equivalent of essexite. The discovery of <b>theralite</b> was looked forward to with interest as completing the series of basic rocks containing nepheline as an essential constituent.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{increase}} in silica (SiO2) and the concomitant reduction in nepheline, <b>theralite</b> becomes gabbro. With a decrease in silica and reduction in olivine <b>theralite</b> grades into teschenite and {{with the addition of}} sodic feldspar, grades into essexite. With a further reduction in silica such that there is no feldspar these rocks become melteigites. With the addition of alkali feldspar replacing or becoming more dominant than calcic plagioclase theralites grade into foidal syenite, including shonkinite.|$|E
40|$|The Kamarbon {{alkaline}} gabbroic intrusion crops out in Central Alborz, north Iran, {{along the}} northern margin of the Alpine-Himalayan belt. The gabbroic intrusion includes <b>theralites</b> at margins which replace with teschenites toward the center. In teschenitic rocks, the main minerals are diopside, clinopyroxene, and rhönite. In this research, the occurrence of rhönite is reported in Kamarbon teschenitic gabbros, and also its mineralogical properties, paragenesis, and source magma are investigated. Based on whole rock and microprobe analysis data, we try to clarify the formation of Kamarbon gabbro and the crystallization condition of rhönite. In teschenitic gabbros, rhönite reveals the composition (Na, Ca) 1. 97 (Ti, VIAl, Fe+ 3, Fe+ 2, Mn, Mg) 5. 99 (Si, IVAl) 6. 02 O 20. On the basis of petrographical observations and mineral chemistry, we suggest that the teschenites were formed in distinctive lower pressures and temperatures than <b>theralites,</b> below 1. 9 kbar and 1075 °C. Rhönite was crystallized (at the mentioned P-T condition) as a primary phase, in the late stage of crystallization at shallow depth corresponding with 6 – 10 km, in teschenites. Important factors of the rhönite crystallization in undersaturated magmas can be regardarded as Al and Ti enrichment and Si depletion; the same enrichment and depletion are also observed in the associated clinopyroxenes...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} based on a set of {{coarse-grained}} igneous rocks collected from two zoned plutons located in the central part of Tahiti Nui and Raiatea. The Ahititera pluton (central depression of Tahiti Nui) comprises a great diversity of rocks, ranging from ultrabasic to felsic in composition. It shows a concentric zonation with nepheline-free rocks in its periphery and nepheline-bearing rocks in its central part. The Faaroa pluton (central depression of Raiatea) is entirely mafic and includes only gabbros and <b>theralites.</b> The two plutons have variable Nd–Sr isotopic signatures, especially the Ahititera rocks, which are subdivided into three groups based on their mineralogy, geochemistry and isotope composition. The isotopic variability probably reflects local heterogeneities in the Society mantle plume. Petrographic and isotopic data have been used to define two mag-matic suites in Ahititera, identifiable from their degree of Si under-saturation. The evolution of the mildly Si-undersaturated suite i...|$|R

5000|$|Essexites are {{no longer}} {{considered}} part of the <b>theralite</b> group and are more properly known as nepheline monzogabbro or nepheline monzodiorite. The presence of orthoclase indicates a petrogenetic difference with nepheline gabbros.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Theralite</b> (from Greek [...] "to pursue") is, in petrology, {{the name}} given to calcic foidal gabbro, a {{plutonic}} hylocrystalline rock consisting of augite, olivine, calcic plagioclase (labradorite), and nepheline, along with accessories including biotite, magnetite, ilmenite and analcime.|$|E
5000|$|Rocks {{that contain}} leucite or nepheline, either partly or a wholly {{replacing}} felspar, {{are not included}} in this table. They are essentially of intermediate or of mafic character. We might in consequence regard them as varieties of syenite, diorite, gabbro, etc., in which feldspathoid minerals occur, and indeed there are many transitions between syenites of ordinary type and nepheline — or leucite — syenite, and between gabbro or dolerite and <b>theralite</b> or essexite. But, as many minerals develop in these [...] "alkali" [...] rocks that are uncommon elsewhere, it is convenient in a purely formal classification like that outlined here to treat the whole assemblage as a distinct series.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Despite a {{wide range}} in parent rock compositions, from analcime-olivine <b>theralite</b> to analcime-tinguaite, clinopyroxene phenocrysts in the Square Top {{intrusion}} show limited compositional variation. The crystallization trend of the pyroxenes (principally sahlites) lies approximately parallel to the diopside-hedenbergite join of the pyroxene quadrilateral, and in addition reveals slight enrichment inaemite. The limited iron enrichment inthe pyroxenes (and in olivine phenoerysts in the theralites and tinguaites) stemmed from progressively more hydrous liquid fractions whose ferric/ferrous iron ratios increased uring dif-ferentiation. T HE Square Top intrusion, a small plug-like mass with an exposed thickness of 250 - 300 ft, located 2 miles west of Nundle, New South Wales, reveals the transition from base to top of analcime-olivine <b>theralite,</b> through leucocratic <b>theralite</b> and melanocratic tinguaite, to analcime-tinguaite. Clinopyroxene and olivine, the most important ferromagnesian minerals of the various facies, both decrease in abun-dance in successive differentiates. The principal geochemical trend with differentiation was alkali enrichment (Wilkinson, 1965 a, fig. 3). The most salic tinguaites (differentiation indices = 77 - 7 and 79 - 4) plot in the lowest temperature r gion in the undersaturated portion of the NaA 1 SiO 4 -KA 1 Si 04 -Si 02 system and their production from <b>theralite</b> is considered to have resulted from fairly rapid but nevertheless highly effective fractional crystallization processes. Petrographic and optical data In the theralites and tinguaites, clinopyroxene occurs as euhedral phenocrysts, in places glomeroporphyritic, and commonly peppered with opaque oxide inclusions. Groundmass clinopyroxenes in the tinguaites contrast exturally with the phenocrysts in exhibiting sub-ophitic relationships with laths of alkali feldspar...|$|E
