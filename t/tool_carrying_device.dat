50|$|Fallow {{fields are}} not unproductive. During the fallow period, {{shifting}} cultivators use the successive vegetation species widely for timber for fencing and construction, firewood, thatching, ropes, clothing, <b>tools,</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>devices</b> and medicines. It {{is common for}} fruit and nut trees to be planted in fallow fields {{to the extent that}} parts of some fallows are in fact orchards. Soil-enhancing shrub or tree species may be planted or protected from slashing or burning in fallows. Many of these species have been shown to fix nitrogen. Fallows commonly contain plants that attract birds and animals and are important for hunting. But perhaps most importantly, tree fallows protect soil against physical erosion and draw nutrients to the surface from deep in the soil profile.|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The {{cryogenic storage}} device (100) comprises a sample <b>carrying</b> <b>device</b> (10) that is set up to accommodate samples, a cryogenic container (20) that is set up to accommodate the sample <b>carrying</b> <b>device,</b> a container cooling device with which the cryogenic container is cooled, an intermediate storage container (40) that is set up for intermediate storage of the sample <b>carrying</b> <b>device,</b> a transport device (50) with which the sample <b>carrying</b> <b>device</b> is moved between the cryogenic container and the intermediate storage container, and a sensor device with which an operating parameter of the cryogenic storage device is registered. The transport device is set up to be activated in dependence on an output signal from the sensor device upon registering a predetermined operating condition of the cryogenic storage device, so that the sample <b>carrying</b> <b>device</b> is moved from the cryogenic container to the intermediate storage container. The device further includes an intermediate storage cooling device that is set up for cooling the intermediate storage container is activated in dependence on the output signal of the sensor device upon registering the predetermined operating condition of the cryogenic storage device. The sensor device has one of the sensor types, which comprise a sample carrying temperature sensor that is designed for detecting temperature in the sample <b>carrying</b> <b>device,</b> a container temperature sensor that is designed for detecting temperature in the cryogenic container, an intermediate storage temperature sensor that is designed for detecting temperature in the intermediate storage container, a coolant sensor, that is designed for detecting a coolant consumption of the cooling device, a level sensor in the cryogenic container, a flow sensor that is designed for detecting an operating condition of a coolant valve of the cooling device, a camera device that is designed for image reception in the intermediate storage container and/or the cryogenic container, a pressure sensor that is designed for detecting a low pressure in an evacuated wall of the cryogenic container, a sample carrying test sensor that is designed for detecting an operating condition of the sample <b>carrying</b> <b>device,</b> a gas sensor for detecting a gas composition in the intermediate storage container and/or the cryogenic container and/or a time measuring device for detecting a time period during which the sample <b>carrying</b> <b>device</b> is present in the intermediate storage container. The cryogenic storage device has a locking device, which is designed for introducing and/or withdrawing samples in the intermediate storage container. The intermediate storage container comprises a storage tower, which is disposed on an upper side of the cryogenic container, and an intermediate storage closure device with which an inner chamber of the storage tower is closed. The transport device comprises an elevator, which is disposed on an upper end of the storage tower, a robot arm, and/or an extendable frame. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for operating a cryogenic storage device. USE - Device for cryogenic storage of biological samples useful in the field of biology, biotechnology, pharmacology and medicine. ADVANTAGE - The device ensures reliable and safe cryogenic storage of the biological samples {{over a longer period of}} time without ice formation...|$|R

30|$|Though a lot {{of works}} [7 – 14] {{have been done in}} {{integrating}} PDR with WiFi localization, some key problems remain to be solved to enhance reliability and applicability.

Secondly, most existing integrated localization approaches assumes that the <b>device</b> <b>carrying</b> positions and <b>device</b> orientations are fixed, such as held in hand [15, 16].
