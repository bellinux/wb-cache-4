5|$|Advances in {{military}} architecture {{over the previous}} century had led to the construction or enhancement of fortresses that could withstand <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> of cannonballs and mortar shells. For both Gebhard and Ernst, winning the war required mobilizing enough men to encircle a seemingly endless array of enemy artillery fortresses. These could be protected with relatively small garrisons, but taking them required both expensive artillery and enough men to storm the battlements. Furthermore, the victor had to maintain and defend all his possessions as they were acquired. Even the ruin of the Godesburg required a garrison and a defensive strategy; as a strategic point on the north-south road from Bonn to Koblenz, it came under siege in 1586 and again in 1588. The Cologne War, similar to the Dutch Revolt, was not a war of assembled armies facing each other on a field, but a war of artillery sieges. It required men who could operate the machinery of war, which meant extensive economic resources for soldiers to build and operate the siege works, and a political and military will to keep the machinery of war operating.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical theater (driven by {{carriage}} wheels): The inventors of {{the field}} mill mentioned above, Xie Fei and Wei Mengbian of the Later Zhao (319–351 AD), also invented an intricate mechanical theater mounted on a carriage, its figures operated by motive power (i.e. simply advancing the carriage forward). From 335 to 345 AD, they worked at the court of the ethnic-Jie emperor Shi Hu (334–349). The vehicle they crafted was a four-wheeled and 6m (20ft) long carriage that was about 3m (10ft) wide. On it rested a large golden Buddha statue with a Daoist statue continually rubbing his front with his mechanical hand. The Buddha was also surrounded by ten wooden Daoists who rotated around him in a circuit, periodically bowing to him, saluting him, and throwing incense into a censer. Above the Buddha were nine dragon-headed faucets which spouted water. Like the field mill and <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> cart of these two inventors, when the carriage halted, so did all of its moving components of mechanical statues and spouting faucets.|$|E

25|$|To {{participate}} in the ERM, Ireland had to break <b>the</b> Irish <b>pound's</b> parity with <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> sterling in 1979, because <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> sterling, which was not an ERM currency, appreciated against all ERM currencies shortly after {{the launch of the}} ERM. The continued parity between <b>the</b> Irish <b>pound</b> and <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> sterling would have taken <b>the</b> Irish <b>pound</b> outside its agreed band.

50|$|During {{the time}} of Henry III, <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> {{sterling}} equalled <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> weight Tower. In the 28th year of Edward I (around 1300), <b>the</b> Tale <b>Pound,</b> or Pound Sterling, first began to differ from or come short of <b>the</b> <b>Pound</b> weight Tower, from which it originated and to which it had been equal until then, for by indenture of that year <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> weight was to contain 20s. 3d. in Tale. In the 27th year of Edward III (around 1354), <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> sterling was now only 80% of <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> weight, or 9 oz 12 dwt (or 9.6 oz) Tower. By an Act of 13 Henry IV (around 1412), <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> weight of standard silver was to contain thirty shillings in Tale, or {{one and a half}} <b>pounds</b> sterling; thus <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> sterling reduced to two-thirds of a pound weight, or 8 oz Tower. <b>The</b> <b>pound</b> sterling was adjusted in weight several more times thereafter.|$|R
5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also {{out of the reach of}} many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E
25|$|On defense, Abdul-Jabbar {{maintained}} a dominant presence. He {{was selected to}} the NBA All-Defensive Team eleven times. He frustrated opponents with his superior shot-blocking ability, denying an average 2.6 shots a game. After <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> he endured early in his career, his rebounding average fell to between six or eight a game in his latter years.|$|E
25|$|Not all the {{soldiers}} were agreed to stay together. They began grumbling and thinking {{that it was going}} to be every man for himself as the bison hunters described it. Two men fell behind and were lost to Nolan. Through <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> heat and endless march, men began to fall. Nolan continued to assign the strongest with the weakest. The desire for water stood above all else as Nolan headed south-east toward where he knew water was.|$|E

50|$|In 1949, the United Kingdom devalued <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> {{sterling}} against <b>the</b> US dollar by 30%, and Australia {{followed suit}} so that <b>the</b> Australian <b>pound</b> would not become over-valued in sterling zone countries with which Australia {{did most of}} its external trade at the time.

25|$|Much of Magnétophone's {{music from}} the early singles to the first LP is notable for its 'challenging' nature (<b>the</b> <b>pounding,</b> broken, {{distorted}} beats and unrecognisable bass textures of 'I Hear Blonde Falcons' being a case-in-point), {{and it is clear}} that the band at this stage were often concerned with creating original audio 'objects' that have questionable worth outside of pure abstract appreciation; other tracks from this time more clearly reference rock'n'roll's more simple appeal, and the balancing of these two ethics across a record creates a unique and unsettling audio and emotional experience.|$|E
25|$|The {{sturdiness}} and quietness of the LCA proved invaluable during Operation Dragoon, {{the invasion}} of southern France in July 1944. Operation Romeo had LCAs of the RCN disembark the 1er Commando Français de l'Afrique du Nord to disable German artillery atop the cliffs of Cap Nègre. Canadian LCAs also landed the U.S.-Canadian 1st Special Service Force on the difficult, sharp-rocked shores of Île du Levant in a pre-dawn operation to silence batteries there that threatened the main force. The LCA was a strong little craft, in this instance standing up better to <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> in rough landings than other LC types, especially on these rocky offshore islands, when many LCVPs were lost. Following the landings in southern France, the RN's LSI units remained in the Mediterranean or began moving to the Indian Ocean in anticipation of joining the war against Japan.|$|E
25|$|In 1857 the {{sailing ship}} Dunbar {{carrying}} 63 passengers and 59 crew struck the rocky cliff {{at the foot}} of The Gap. The Dunbar, which was captained by James Green, had left England on 31 May 1857 arriving off Botany Bay shortly after dark on 20 August 1857. In poor visibility and stormy weather, Captain Green misjudged the entrance to the harbour. The Dunbar drove into the rocky cliff {{at the foot of}} The Gap causing the ship's topmasts to snap and the ship to turn broadside against the rocks because of <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> of the waves. By light next day, crowds watched as breakers pounded victims' corpses against the rocks. Other bodies amid cargo and wreckage were washed inside Sydney harbour with the incoming tide; many of the dead were naked and had been mutilated by sharks. The funeral of the Dunbar victims was one of the longest processions ever seen in Sydney. The unidentified dead were buried in a common grave at Camperdown cemetery.|$|E
50|$|In 1707, <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> Scots was {{replaced}} by <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> sterling {{at a rate of}} 12 to 1 (1 pound Scots equal to 1s 8d sterling), although <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> Scots continued to be used in Scotland as a unit of account for most of the 18th century.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>pound</b> was <b>the</b> {{currency}} of Malawi until 1971.

This {{was replaced by}} <b>the</b> Malawian <b>pound</b> in 1964, following Malawi's independence. <b>The</b> <b>pound</b> was subdivided into 20 shillings, each of 12 pence. <b>The</b> <b>pound</b> {{was replaced by the}} kwacha in 1971, at a rate of 2 kwacha = 1 pound.|$|R
50|$|A lock pound {{lies between}} two locks which {{are only a}} short {{distance}} apart. Water levels in <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> are liable to fluctuate as the locks are used. Boats entering <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> from <b>the</b> lower level remove a lockful of water from <b>the</b> <b>pound,</b> while those using the upper lock add a lockful of water. Because the maximum level in <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> is normally controlled by a bywash weir at the lower lock, some of {{the water from the}} upper lock may be lost over it, and if the lower lock has a deeper fall, there is a net loss of level when a boat passes through <b>the</b> <b>pound.</b>|$|R
25|$|During construction, many {{problems}} were encountered in scaling up the WAGR design. Problems {{with the construction}} of the pressure vessel liner had distorted it, so that the boilers, which were to fit in an annular space between the reactor and the pressure vessel, could not be installed, and the liner had to be partially dismantled and rebuilt. This work only cost about £200,000, but there was a huge cost of financing for an extra 18 unproductive months a power station costing around £100 million, of which some 60% was already on the ground. Serious problems were also discovered with the design of the boilers, which had to withstand <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> of hot carbon dioxide (CO2), pressurised to 600 pounds per square inch (4.1 megapascals) and pumped around the reactor coolant circuit by massive gas circulators, and the casings, hangers and tube supports all had to be redesigned. The cost of these modifications, and financing during the delays, caused severe financial pressures for the consortium and its backers, and in 1969 APC collapsed into administration.|$|E
25|$|The two ironclads {{returned}} to action on March 13, this time assisted by the shore battery and the mortar boat. The Confederate gunners again concentrated their fire on Chillicothe. Although she lost only three wounded among her crew, <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> she took from the enemy artillery loosened {{many of her}} armor plates and generally revealed the inadequacy of her construction. Baron De Kalb, although not punished so severely, lost three of her officers and men killed and three others wounded. The Rebels lost some of their men also, when a shell entered a magazine. Although it did not explode, its fuze {{set fire to the}} ammunition stored there, and the fire killed one man and burned 15 others. Another shell killed a man and wounded two others. At the end of the day, Fort Pemberton was basically unscathed; the gunboats, however, particularly Chillicothe, had been badly battered. Smith failed to note that the Confederate fire was slackening {{at the end of the}} day, their ammunition supply being depleted.|$|E
25|$|The {{mission of}} the fast carrier forces had by this time evolved into sealing off {{designated}} enemy-held atolls and islands which the Allies intended to take and interdicting others to isolate and keep to a minimum Japanese resistance at the target. Now a third mission was to be added, <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> of major enemy bases {{without the aid of}} land-based aircraft, leaving little or no need for a return visit. Thus, to ease the occupation of Eniwetok and to aid in the encirclement of Rabaul, TF 58 departed Majuro and sailed for the Carolines. On 16–17 February, they devastated Truk, the best fleet anchorage in the Mandated Territories, the base of the Japanese combined fleet and the center for air and sea communications between Japan and the Bismarck Archipelago. The force then sailed northwest to the Mariana Islands for strikes on Saipan, Tinian, and Guam, encountering heavy aerial resistance there on 21–22 February. After a brief respite for replenishment at Majuro, Mobile sailed to Espiritu Santo, where the ships of TG 58.1 were reorganized as TG 36.1 on 12 March. On 15 March, they steamed northwest to cover Marine forces as they landed on Emirau on 20 March.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of the New Zealand dollar in 1967, <b>the</b> New Zealand <b>pound</b> was <b>the</b> currency of New Zealand, which had been distinct from <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> sterling since 1933. <b>The</b> <b>pound</b> used <b>the</b> £sd system, in which <b>the</b> <b>pound</b> was divided into 20 shillings and one shilling was divided into 12 pence, which by the 1950s was considered complicated and cumbersome.|$|R

25|$|With the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, along the intracity frontier, Potsdamer Platz now found itself physically divided in two. What had once been a busy intersection had become totally desolate. With the clearance of most of the remaining bomb-damaged buildings on both sides (on the eastern side, this was done chiefly to give border guards a clear view of would-be escapees and an uninterrupted line of fire), little was left in an area of dozens of hectares. Further demolitions occurred up until 1976 when the Haus Vaterland finally disappeared. After that, only two buildings in the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz still stood– one complete, the other in a half-ruined fragmented form: the Weinhaus Huth's steel skeleton had enabled the building to withstand <b>the</b> <b>pounding</b> of World War II virtually undamaged, and it stood out starkly amid a great levelled wasteland, although now occupied only by groups of squatters. A short distance away stood portions of the former Hotel Esplanade, including the Kaisersaal, used at various times as a much scaled-down hotel, cinema, nightclub and occasional film-set (scenes from Cabaret were shot there). Apart from these, no other buildings remained. Below ground, the U-Bahn section through Potsdamer Platz had closed entirely; although the S-Bahn line itself remained open, it suffered from a quirk of geography in that it briefly passed through East German territory en route from one part of West Berlin to another. Consequently, Potsdamer Platz S-Bahn station became the most infamous of several Geisterbahnhofe (ghost stations), through which trains ran without stopping, its previously bustling platforms now decrepit, sealed off from the outside world, and patrolled by armed guards.|$|E
