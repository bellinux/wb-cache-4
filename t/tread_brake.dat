40|$|Modern {{trains are}} {{equipped}} with different braking systems, between which the braking effort can be distributed. Among these, tread braking {{is still the most}} common system for friction braking. <b>Tread</b> <b>brake</b> systems are cheap and robust. However, extensive usage of tread brakes demands knowledge of operational limits to ensure safety and decrease life cycle costs (LCC) of the running gear. In the present work, a state-of-the-art literature survey has been compiled which covers topics related to establishing operational limits such as: brake control and blended braking, braking temperatures, brake block materials, wear and rolling contact fatigue of wheels due to tread braking, and capacity of tread brakes and brake discs. A methodology to simulate full-scale brake rig tests, including wheel-rail contact, has been further developed. It includes an axisymmetric thermal analysis, a 3 D mechanical wheel-rail contact analysis, and a 3 D thermomechanical analysis of the braked wheel. The behaviour of ER 7 grade railway wheel material is mimicked by use of a plasticity model calibrated against results from cyclic experiments on test specimens. The results from the simulations in terms of predicted fatigue lives show good agreement with full-scale test rig results for three combinations of initial velocity and brake block material. The developed methodology is employed in parametric studies. These consist of braking load cases characterised by operational parameters such as axle load, maximum vehicle speed, deceleration, block material, and initial wheel temperature. Damage evolution in the wheel tread is studied. A strong infuence of high temperatures on rolling contact fatigue formation in the wheel tread was observed. In particular, braking temperatures over 450 °C can result in a very short life up to crack initiation. However, for braking temperatures in the range of 300 - 350 °C, wheel tread material is more resistant to fatigue due to strain hardening...|$|E

40|$|Wheel treads {{are subject}} to {{different}} types of damage such as wear, rolling contact fatigue (RCF), thermal cracks, plastic deformation and also flats caused by wheel sliding.

In this study, a series of full-scale <b>tread</b> <b>braking</b> experiments, including wheel-rail rolling contact, were conducted in order to clarify the influencing factors of evolution of wheel tread profile. The experiments focused on plastic deformation and wear caused by rolling contact and <b>tread</b> <b>braking.</b> The presented results show that the maximum tread depression is 0. 20 mm at the rolling contact center after 40 times stop braking actions. This is considered to be caused by plastic deformation of the wheel tread induced by high contact pressure and material softening due to high temperatures from <b>tread</b> <b>braking.</b> This result is supported by the observed protrusion of the tread near the rolling contact area and also by a difference of hardness between the rolling contact area and other tread area...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tread</b> <b>braking</b> is {{a common}} braking system for railway {{vehicles}} which is used mainly on freight wagons {{but also as a}} component on trains with mixed braking systems. In general, railway wheels for <b>tread</b> <b>braking</b> are designed only by considering a maximum allowed braking power according to the wheel design standard EN 13979 - 1. The idea is to avoid derailment risks due to change of wheelset gauge or global wheel fracture caused by excessive tensile stresses in the wheel rim. In the present paper, the fatigue life of the wheel web is studied in detail when subjected to a combination of thermomechanical loading from <b>tread</b> <b>braking</b> and mechanical loading from wheel-rail contact forces. Two generic wheel designs are assessed where one represents the classical freight wheel with a slightly S-shaped web and the other is a so-called low-stress wheel, with a more elaborate shape of the wheel web, specifically designed for high thermal loads. The wheel designs are studied both with new rims and with fully worn down rims. The results show that railway wheels generally have sufficient fatigue lives for regular service with respect to thermomechanical loading. Moreover, it is shown that the studied wheels have different sensitivities to mechanical and thermomechanical loadings at some critical positions on the wheel web. Towards the wheel rim, the damage as induced by <b>tread</b> <b>braking</b> is dominating and towards the hub the damage from mechanical loading is more important. A general conclusion is that maintenance of the wheel webs is important for preserving a high safety of the railway system...|$|R

The main objective {{of the present study}} is to find the limits for <b>tread</b> <b>braking</b> with respect to temperature impact on rolling contact fatigue (RCF) of the wheel tread. A wheel with an S-shaped web is studied for some different stop braking loads. Using 3 D FE simulations, the effects of simultaneous thermal loading from braking and mechanical loading, with traversing wheel-rail rolling contact, are studied. In order to account for the elevated temperatures, the simulations utilise a temperature-dependent elastoplastic material model. The mechanical loads account for frictional rolling contact stress distributions induced by braking, using a novel method that is based on elastoplastic contact simulations. Partial slip is considered and interfacial shear stresses are introduced in the wheel-rail contact area. Evolution of damage {{in the vicinity of the}} wheel tread is studied for various brake loading cases. In order to assess limits for the <b>tread</b> <b>braking,</b> the calculated damage is compared to previously developed critical damage levels which were based on full-scale brake rig testing. Results are presented for a parametric study with thermomechanical loading based on different load cases. The influence from operational parameters such as axle loads, initial speeds, decelerations and block material is studied. The results show that the temperature has a strong influence on the rolling contact fatigue of the wheel treads and, hence, also on the thermal capacity of the wheels. The study gives preliminary limits for revenue traffic, described as combinations of tread temperatures and wheel-rail rolling contact loading, which should be respected to avoid thermal cracking of the wheel treads...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tread</b> <b>braking</b> of railway wheels {{results in}} the kinetic energy of the train being {{dissipated}} into the wheel and blocks {{in the form of}} heat. This heat is further conducted into adjacent structures, notably the cold rail, and also transferred into the surroundings by convection and radiation. Heat partitioning between wheel and block is, for short time periods, controlled by local thermal interactions at the contact point and by the conductive properties of the bodies. However, for a metro train that performs longer periods of intermittent braking (or for drag braking) convective and radiation cooling properties of the components come into play. In the present study, results from brake rig tests and from in-field testing of a metro train are presented and used to calibrate a simulation model. It is found that the cooling level of the wheels of the metro train is substantially lower than for the wheels of a freight wagon. Moreover, it is found that the first axle on the metro train is exposed to higher cooling levels than the remaining axles. In a numerical example, temperatures of <b>tread</b> <b>braked</b> wheels are calculated using the new findings for a metro train, and the results obtained are compared with wheel temperatures as calculated assuming freight wagon conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} rise of wheels and blocks due to frictional heating during railway <b>tread</b> <b>braking</b> {{along with the}} transfer of heat through the wheel–rail contact is studied in this paper. In particular, heat partitioning between block, wheel and rail for stop braking cycles is considered. The wheels are of interest because they are a limiting factor for railway <b>tread</b> <b>braking</b> systems. Two types of thermal models are employed to investigate the maximum temperatures over the wheel tread. In a circumferential (plane) model of wheel, block and rail, the heat transfer problem is studied by use of a finite element formulation of the two-dimensional time-dependent convection–diffusion equation. The hot spot phenomenon is simulated by introducing a prescribed wheel-fixed contact pressure distribution between wheel and block. In an axisymmetric (axial) model of wheel, block and rail, the lateral movements of the wheel–rail contact are studied. A general {{result is that the}} cooling effect provided by the rail is important when local temperatures on the tread are considered, but not when studying bulk temperatures created in a single stop braking event. Furthermore, it is found from the lateral movements of the wheel–rail contact that slow oscillations result in maximum temperatures over the wheel tread that are somewhat lower than for travelling on straight track (rolling at the rolling circle) ...|$|R

Several aspects of the <b>tread</b> <b>braking</b> system, important for the dimensioning of railway wheels, have been assessed, such as brake block materials and residual stresses and temperature gradients through wheel rim and wheel disc. Additionally, two different railway wheel designs, with typical characteristics of freight and metro wheels, have been numerically studied with respect to design criteria for load cases of drag braking and stop braking. Brake rig experiments and a field test campaign were performed and aimed at measuring wheel and brake block temperatures during different service conditions for a metro line. It was concluded that even though the same nominal routes were simulated in the brake rig tests as those the field tests, the braking efforts are different. Therefore, simulation and calibration tools were employed in order to facilitate a comparison between measured temperatures. The results showed the importance of knowing the convection cooling parameters for different wagons if prolonged braking action is to be considered. Heat partitioning between wheel, block and rail has been numerically studied in a broad parametric study to investigate the influence of brake block materials, thermal parameters and brake pressure distribution. By use of a plane model, the implication of temperature variations around the wheel circumference (hot spots) is studied in detail. Even though the hot spots have a major impact on local temperatures, they were found to have only a minor influence on the global heat partitioning in the wheel-block-rail system. By use of an axisymmetric model, it was found that a presumed constant axial position of the wheel-rail contact towards the flange side of the tread leads to substantially higher maximum tread temperatures than a wheel-rail contact centred at the brake block position...|$|R

In a pin-on-disc experimental study of railway braking materials, the heat partitioning characteristics between wheel and block material at controlled elevated disc temperatures were investigated by a finite element approach where a model was calibrated using measured temperatures. In the final part of the present thesis, a modelling framework was proposed and developed that represents typical conditions in metro and suburban operations, in particular during sequential stop braking. A parametric study was done for analysing the influence of various loading levels and other important factors on temperatures, axial flange deflection, residual stresses and the fatigue life of the wheels.

40|$|A {{thermal model}} of railway <b>tread</b> <b>braking</b> is {{developed}} {{for use in}} routine calculations of wheel and brake block temperatures. Two-dimensional finite-element models of block(s) and wheel are coupled via a contact interface that controls the heat generation and also the heat partitioning between block and wheel through thermal contact resistances. The surface temperature variations around the wheel circumference as caused by frictional heating and intermediate cooling are accounted for in a mean sense, assuming high-speed sliding conditions. The thermal power generated at the block-wheel interface during braking is determined from train braking data. A model for heat transfer from the rolling wheel into the rail is developed where a film with thermal contact resistance is placed at the wheel-rail contact interface. The present model {{can be used to}} efficiently design <b>tread</b> <b>braking</b> systems for both freight and passenger trains.

Both defects around the complete wheel circumference (e. g. polygonal wheels with wavelengths up to one wheel circumference) and local defects (e. g. wheel flats) are studied. Wheel tread irregularities occurring in different types of train traffic in Sweden (high-speed, passenger, freight, commuter, subway) have been assessed using out-of-roundness measurements. These measurements show that high roughness levels with wavelengths between 3 cm and 8 cm (corrugation) are present on <b>tread</b> <b>braked</b> freight wheels and <b>tread</b> <b>braked</b> powered X 2 high-speed train wheels. A previously known polygonalization of C 20 subway wheels has been quantified. The influence {{of different types of}} wheel out-of-roundness on the vertical dynamic wheel-rail contact force and on the track response is investigated through extensive field tests and numerical simulations. Measured responses are used to calibrate and validate numerical models for simulation of train-track interaction in the time domain. An existing multibody system model for simulation of general three-dimensional train-track interaction is extended to include rolling contact mechanics according to the FASTSIM model and wear according to the Archard model, and also general wheel and rail profiles. The numerical model employs an iteration scheme with simulation of dynamic train-track interaction in the time domain coupled to a model of long-term wear. The extended model is used to study wheel polygonalization on subway wheels and rail corrugation growth due to (corrugated or round) powered high-speed train wheelsets. Some polygonalization wavelength-fixing mechanisms depending on the track properties have been discovered.
