5|$|The first Brahmousin cattle were {{produced}} from a multiple embryo transfer from a French-imported Limousin dam. The resulting progeny were then crossed with Brahman cattle {{to achieve an}} F1 hybrid. Further crosses over a broader base led {{to the production of}} the 5/8 Limousin – 3/8 Brahman Brahmousin purebred, a mix which {{has been found to be}} the most widely accepted and most useful for the majority of the USA. The American Brahmousin Council allows animals that are not purebred <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> as percentage animals as long as they are at least one-quarter Limousin and one-quarter Brahman. In order <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> as a purebred Brahmousin, the animal must then be sired by a registered purebred or fullblood Limousin bull, registered Brahman bull or a registered purebred Brahmousin bull.|$|E
5|$|A pilot {{episode was}} {{commissioned}} on 1 March 1977 and the recording was completed on 28 June 1977. Brett and Adams recounted {{different parts of}} the pilot episode's genesis, including convincing the BBC that such a programme could not be recorded with a studio audience, and insisting that the programme be recorded in stereo sound. To win the latter argument, Hitchhiker's was briefly classified internally as a drama instead of a comedy, as in 1977 BBC Radio Drama programmes were allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> in stereo, and BBC Radio Comedy programmes were not.|$|E
5|$|As {{the entire}} album was {{recorded}} and played by Anderson, {{the only option}} was to record the music in layers. First, he recorded the drums, using a drum kit.

The next layers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> were the guitar, bass and vocals, with other sounds being added later.|$|E

5|$|Examination by {{a severe}} weather {{team from the}} Bureau of Meteorology {{examined}} the damage in the Bucca and Kolan region and recorded it as an 'F4' on the Fujita scale.

5|$|Holkham's north-facing coastal {{location}} {{can attract}} {{large numbers of}} migrating birds in autumn if the weather conditions are right, especially with a north to north-east wind.

Vagrant rarities such as Pallas's, Radde's or dusky warblers may occur; a red-breasted nuthatch in 1989 was the first, and, as of 2012, the only individual of its species <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> in the UK.|$|E
5|$|In October 2009, {{the launch}} of a call for tenders stalled {{following}} discussions between the Scottish Executive and HM Treasury over new regulations that required public–private partnerships <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> as public expenditure.

By the early 1930s Chinese-owned businesses were the dominating force in the country's film industry.|$|E

5|$|Vampyr was {{challenging}} for Dreyer {{to make as}} {{it was his first}} sound film and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>recorded</b> in three languages.

The audio editing was done in Berlin where the character's voices, sound effects, and score were added to the film.|$|E
