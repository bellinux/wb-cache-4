She said, [...] "I think the way Steve [...] has played Brax, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> enough there for Charlie {{to see that he}} has a heart and to see the good side in him as well." [...] Discussing the plot in which Charlie tried to keep Ruby away from Casey, Anderson said, [...] "I think she's also telling herself to stay away from Brax, but Charlie can't get him out of her head." [...] Colin Vickery of The Daily Telegraph said Darryl had turned Charlie's [...] "safe police world" [...] upside down, and Anderson told him, [...] "What is wonderful about this relationship is that it is forbidden love. There is this element of danger that brings excitement along with it." [...] She described the relationship as [...] "fun and flirty" [...] and said it shows another layer to Charlie, as it has brought out her fun side. The arrival of Darryl's ex-girlfriend Tegan Callahan (Saskia Burmeister) causes Charlie and Darryl to split. However, Vickery said it was obvious that Charlie cannot stay away from Darryl for long.|$|E
500|$|Barb Richards, {{director}} of music for WAJI {{said that the}} cast's introduction of new music prompted the station to finally add music from the cast. Richards referenced the 21.9million downloads and 5.2million albums sold since the series since its May2009 premiere, but commented, [...] "Still, I believe {{that people want to}} hear originals over remakes, so up until the 'Glee' cast's original music it didn't make sense for us to play each latest cover, other than to spotlight it the day of the show." [...] However, Richards complimented the original [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] saying its lyrics would [...] "resonate with kids and parents" [...] and said that she liked it when she first heard it and when she saw it on the show. She also commented that it [...] "is good on its own, and having the Glee name on it gives it a leg up". Dave McKay, program director at WPST also echoed Richards' sentiments that the Glee sales were reason to add them to airplay, adding [...] "Not many artists or songs enjoy the type of exposure that 'Glee' provides. Plus, the audience that watches the show is the audience we target, so the fit seems perfect [...] since 'Glee' music sells, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> an appetite for it." ...|$|E

500|$|Garland {{began writing}} Dredd during {{post-production}} {{of his other}} writing credit Sunshine, and completed his first draft while serving as an executive producer during filming of 28 Weeks Later. Garland's draft revolved around one of Dredd's main enemies, the undead Judge Death. He described the story as a [...] "riff on the whole Judge system", but {{that it did not}} work because the Judge system had not yet been established and required too much knowledge about the Judge Dredd comic from the audience. He also considered the end result too surreal and extreme. From this script, Garland decided that the story needed to be more focused and grounded. He instead considered adapting some of the notable Judge Dredd storylines, including [...] "Democracy" [...] (1986) and [...] "Origins" [...] (2006). He decided to avoid these lengthy tales in favour of a shorter, day-in-the-life story about Dredd and his function as a cop in the dystopian environment of Mega-City One. When developing the Judge Dredd character, Garland tried to closely follow that of the comic-book character, who undergoes only small personality changes over a lengthy period of time. He said: [...] "I didn't think Dredd could have a great epiphany, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> a change in him {{over the course of the}} movie. He makes a very clear statement at the beginning of the film which he then contradicts at the end. That's about as far as the shift goes." [...] Garland intentionally gave the traditional character development to Anderson to compensate for Dredd's character stability.|$|E

In a later interview Hotovely has said that the book is a wonderful PR exercise and that while <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> an Arab, Ottoman and Mulsim history the Palestinians were never a nation and that the basis of the Palestinian narrative is denying the Jewish one, by disseminating lies and attempting to rewrite history.|$|E
2500|$|A more {{positive}} review came from Wolverhampton Express and Star: [...] "Slade haven't {{had a big}} hit for some time now, {{but it would be}} silly to write them off just yet, to judge by their new album Return to Base. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> a Sixties feel to some of the songs, though others are vintage Slade. Most striking thing about the album is its variety, for Slade have loosened up a bit for this one and included much more variety of mood. It certainly pays off. Another striking factor is the guitar playing of Dave Hill, who has really been allowed to branch out on this disc. In all, it's an album which will please Slade's still huge army of fans, both for its fidelity to the Slade sound and for its inventiveness and freshness." [...] In May 1980, Jon Young of New York magazine Trouser Press reviewed the album and stated: [...] "On Return to Base, seven of the eleven cuts connect in every possible way, for a batting average of [...]636. If it had been released in 1973, the classic [...] "Nuts, Bolts and Screws" [...] would've easily topped the UK charts. Okay, there's nothing here quite as wonderful as [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize". But whose fault is that? This kind of music isn't meant for a vacuum! It's meant to be enjoyed! Give Slade some encouragement! You will be glad that you did!!" ...|$|E

Rare is a portable sports title this rich. Its premise is unique and its execution is artful. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>definitely</b> some fun to be had with this." [...] IGN complained that [...] "the biggest problem in Xtreme Sports is its maniacal pace -- the levels and game are well thought out, but all of them require a fast speed and a LOT of quick reaction on the buttons. Your characters are rather large on screen, and there's not much head's up [...] when obstacles approach or when the platforms go in different directions [...] Lots of practice is necessary in Xtreme Sports. Maybe that's why they included a Practice mode right up front."
