40|$|Seventeen {{soil samples}} were {{collected}} from a typical pesticide contaminated site in Henan Province, China. The concentrations and distribution of hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) in the soils were investigated. The concentrations of HCHs ranged from 0. 17 to 84. 26 mg/kg (average 8. 82 mg/kg) and that of DDTs ranged from 0. 19 to 751. 82 mg/kg (average 80. 09 mg/kg). Vertical distribution of pollutants in soil samples indicated that the pollutants were mainly concentrated in <b>top</b> <b>soils</b> rather than deeper soils. The contribution of beta-HCH was the highest among the four HCHs isomers, {{and the proportion of}} p,p'-DDT was the highest among DDTs isomers.

25|$|The soils {{closest to}} the plains of the Saône are too fertile, with patches of poorly drained soils, that make growing quality wine grapes difficult. As you move upwards along the cote {{escarpment}} the soil becomes progressively less fertile with higher proportions of the well-draining and highly porous oolitic limestone and less clay. At this elevation of around 800ft (250 m) most of the premier cru vineyards start to be found with areas of particularly favored location being designated as grand cru. The band of suitable soils for viticulture is narrow because too far up the hills (beyond 1000ft/300 m) the <b>top</b> <b>soil</b> becomes too thin to support vines.|$|E

25|$|Micropiles, {{also called}} mini piles, {{are often used}} for underpinning. They are also used to create {{foundations}} {{for a variety of}} project types, including highway, bridge and transmission tower projects. They are especially useful at sites with difficult or restricted access, or with environmental sensitivity. Micropiles are made of steel with diameters of 60 to 200mm. Installation of micropiles through <b>top</b> <b>soil,</b> sand and cobblestones overburden and into soil rock can be achieved using Air Rotary or Mud Rotary drilling, impact driving, jacking, vibrating or screwing machinery.

25|$|Shallow {{landslides}} {{can often}} happen {{in areas that}} have slopes with high permeable soils on top of low permeable bottom soils. The low permeable, bottom soils trap {{the water in the}} shallower, high permeable soils creating high water pressure in the top soils. As the top soils are filled with water and become heavy, slopes can become very unstable and slide over the low permeable bottom soils. Say there is a slope with silt and sand as its <b>top</b> <b>soil</b> and bedrock as its bottom soil. During an intense rainstorm, the bedrock will keep the rain trapped in the top soils of silt and sand. As the topsoil becomes saturated and heavy, it can start to slide over the bedrock and become a shallow landslide.|$|E
30|$|Trees can {{potentially}} improve soils through numerous processes, including maintenance or increase of soil organic matter, biological nitrogen fixation, uptake of nutrients from below and reach of roots of under storey herbaceous vegetation, increase water infiltration and storage, reduce {{loss of nutrients}} by erosion and leaching, improve soil physical properties, reduce soil acidity and improve soil biological activity. Also, new self-sustaining <b>top</b> <b>soils</b> are created by trees. Plant litter and root exudates provide nutrient cycling to soil (Pulford and Watson 2003; Padmavathiamma and Li 2007).|$|R

25|$|Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated clays, clay shales, {{and poorly}} {{cemented}} sands {{up to several}} miles deep. The region's geology developed from stream deposits formed from {{the erosion of the}} Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic matter that, over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath these tiers is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into dome shapes, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. This thick, rich soil also provides a good environment for rice farming in suburban outskirts into which the city continues to grow near Katy. Evidence of past rice farming is even still evident in developed areas as an abundance of rich, dark, loamy <b>top</b> <b>soil</b> exists.|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of 1930, SR20 was {{established}} from SR61 in Rydal to SR5 in Canton. The entire Rome–Cartersville and Buford–Lawrenceville segments had a completed hard surface. Also, SR53 was designated from the Alabama state line to Rome, farther to the north than SR20. Later that year, the portion of SR20 and SR53 west of Rome were swapped. By the beginning of 1932, US19 was shifted farther {{to the west and}} off of the current SR20 between Buford and Lawrenceville; at the same time, US23 was designated on this same segment. In January 1932, SR20 was established from Canton to Cumming. SR68, from Cumming to Buford, was decommissioned and redesignated as part of SR20. Also, since SR13 was shifted to a more western alignment, its segment from Buford to Lawrenceville was also redesignated as part of SR20. A few months later, SR20 was established from Loganville to Conyers. Nearly a year later, SR20 was established from Conyers to McDonough. The next month, {{the western part of the}} segment from the Alabama state line to Rome was under construction. Later that year, SR20 was designated along SR61 from Cartersville to Rydal, with the entire length having a sand clay or <b>top</b> <b>soil</b> surface. Also, a portion of the highway east of Canton was under construction. Before the year ended, US41W between Rome and Cartersville was redesignated as part of US411, which was also designated along SR20/SR61 from Cartersville to Rydal. At this time, the Rockdale County portion of the segment between Loganville and Conyers was under construction. By {{the middle of}} 1935, the western half of the Canton–Cumming segment was under construction. By October of that year, a small portion east of Canton had a sand clay or <b>top</b> <b>soil</b> surface. At the end of the year, a small portion north-northeast of Cartersville, as well as a small portion north-northeast of Conyers, had a completed hard surface. Later in 1936, the central portion of the SR20/SR61 segment, from Cartersville to Rydal, had completed grading, but was not surfaced. A few months later, a small portion south-southwest of Rydal had a completed hard surface. The entire Forsyth County portion of the Canton–Cumming segment, except for the eastern end, was under construction. Also, the entire Gwinnett County portion of the Cumming–Buford segment had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the middle of the year, the central portion of SR20/SR61, from Cartersville to Rydal, had a completed hard surface. Also, the eastern three-fourths of the Canton–Cumming segment was under construction. A few months later, the western third of this segment had a completed hard surface, while the eastern third of it had completed grading, but was not surfaced. The northern half of the segment between Lawrenceville and Loganville, and nearly the entire northern half of the segment between Conyers and McDonough, also had completed grading, but was not surfaced. About two years later, US23 was shifted farther to the west and off of SR20's path. Also, a small portion northeast of Buford had a sand clay or <b>top</b> <b>soil</b> surface. Before the year ended, about half of the total length of the segment from the Alabama state line and Rome had a completed hard surface.|$|E
25|$|The Penwith {{peninsula}} sits predominantly on granite bedrock {{that has}} {{led to the formation of}} a rugged coastline with many fine beaches. The contact between the granite and the adjoining sedimentary rock (mostly shales) is most clearly seen forming the cliffs at Land's End, the most westerly point in the district and this geology has resulted in the mining that has made Cornwall famous. Tin and copper have been mined in the area since pre-Roman times and the landscape is dotted with ruined mine buildings. Inland, the peninsula is primarily granite with a thin <b>top</b> <b>soil.</b> This combined with Cornwall's exposed position and the prevailing weather systems from the Atlantic Ocean means that, with the exception of the high moor areas, much of the area is a semi-bare plateau standing around 130 m above sea level.

500|$|Evidence {{for human}} {{activity}} {{in the vicinity of}} the barrow from the eleventh through to the thirteenth century [...] during the medieval period [...] appeared in the form of 200 ceramic sherds, 2 hones, and 17 fragments of daub found by archaeologists in the <b>top</b> <b>soil.</b> It was likely in this medieval period that the tomb was heavily destroyed, evidenced by medieval material found in some of the pits created by those damaging the chamber and barrow. The destruction was carried out in a systematic manner. Initially, the barrow around the chamber was dug away, and an entrance into it was forced through the drystone wall at the north-western end. The chamber was then cleared down to the bedrock, with the spoil and contents of the chamber dumped behind the diggers. The medial stone of the chamber was pushed over on to the spoil heap, and covered over with soil. A pit was dug in the centre of the chamber, and against its walls from the outside; the central pit was then ceiled by the collapsing capstones. Finally, several more pits were then dug around the façade stones. Subsequently, the chamber collapsed, with a number of stones breaking on the impact of the fall. At some point after they had fallen, the inner pair of the chamber's tall-stones were further damaged, likely in a process involving heating them with fire and then casting cold water onto them, resulting in breakage.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to carry out a {{detailed}} soil survey to determine soil types and their influence on landslide occurrence in Bududa District in eastern Uganda. Four transects were chosen following zones with and without landsides. Soil profile description and classification was done using FAO methods. Infiltration rates were measured as described by Landon in 1991. Results show that the soil types are those conditioned by topography and tropical climate namely Nitisols, Cambisols, Lixisols, Ferralsols, Leptosols, Gleysols, and Acrisols. Soil type was not significant in landslide occurrences. However soil texture in the horizons was significant in some of the landslides especially in the western zone. One factor that was common to all soils sampled in the western side was the same soil texture of clay down the profile and the subsequent absence of landslides in the surroundings of the profiles. In the eastern zone soil profile horizon is significant in some of the landslides but in the shallow landslides the slope and the shallow depth which creates a discontinuity between the saprolite and the rock causing water stagnation is the main influence. The clay minerals present are high plasticity clays; Kaolinite and Illite.

Pedons were observed to be formed from in-situ weathering of granitic rocks under ustic moisture and iso-hyperthermic temperature regimes. Thirteen soil samples were described and analyzed for physica-chemical and mineralogical properties. KZW-P 1 and FUL-P 1 had red dark brown sandy clay and gravely clay (MKA-P 1) <b>top</b> <b>soils</b> overlaying mainly clayey subsoil.
