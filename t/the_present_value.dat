5|$|By {{the time}} Harding took office, there were calls from foreign governments for {{reduction}} of the massive war debt owed to the United States, and the German government sought to reduce the reparations that it was required to pay. The U.S. refused to consider any multilateral settlement. Harding sought passage of a plan proposed by Mellon to give the administration broad authority to reduce war debts in negotiation, but Congress, in 1922, passed a more restrictive bill. Hughes negotiated an agreement for Britain to pay off its war debt over 62 years at low interest, effectively reducing <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of the obligations. This agreement, approved by Congress in 1923, set a pattern for negotiations with other nations. Talks with Germany on reduction of reparations payments {{would result in the}} Dawes Plan of 1924.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been a steady {{increase}} in the energy output of the Sun. When the Sun first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity. The luminosity has increased in a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years. Likewise, in three billion years the Sun {{is expected to be}} 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value.</b> This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will pass through the subgiant stage and evolve into a red giant.|$|E
25|$|In this {{equation}} {{the left side}} is <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of the draw downs made by the lender and the right side is <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of the repayments made by the borrower. In both cases <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> is defined given the APR as the interest rate. So <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of the drawdowns is equal to <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of the repayments, given the APR as the interest rate.|$|E
50|$|In finance, <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> (NPV) or net {{present worth}} (NPW) is a {{measurement}} of profit calculated by subtracting <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>values</b> (PV) of cash outflows (including initial cost) from <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>values</b> of cash inflows {{over a period}} of time. Incoming and outgoing cash flows can also be described as benefit and cost cash flows, respectively.|$|R

25|$|The {{fundamental}} change that the differential equation perspective brings is that, rather than computing a number (<b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> now), one computes a function (<b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> now {{or at any}} point in future). This function may then be analyzed—how does its value change over time—or compared with other functions.|$|E
25|$|With {{multiple}} internal {{rates of}} return, the IRR approach {{can still be}} interpreted {{in a way that}} is consistent with <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> approach if the underlying investment stream is correctly identified as net investment or net borrowing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{internal}} rate {{of return}} on an investment or project is the [...] "annualized effective compounded return rate" [...] or {{rate of return}} that sets <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of all cash flows (both positive and negative) from the investment equal to zero. Equivalently, it is the discount rate at which <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of future cash flows is equal to the initial investment, and it is also the discount rate at which <b>the</b> total <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of costs (negative cash flows) equals <b>the</b> total <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of <b>the</b> benefits (positive cash flows).|$|R
40|$|An ant colony {{algorithm}} is proposed to improve <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>values</b> of resource-constrained projects since <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> is a critical criterion for a project with a long time span and considerable cash flows. The algorithm adaptively adjusts the allocation of scarce resources according to the pheromone generated by artificial ants in the previous iterations so as to maximize <b>the</b> project’s net <b>present</b> <b>value.</b> <b>The</b> crossover operation, inverse mutation and elitist strategy are applied to accelerate the searching for better project schedules, and the backward scheduling technique is adopted to improve <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> further. <b>The</b> experimental test {{results show that the}} proposed algorithm significantly improves <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>values</b> of resource-constrained projects...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> {{formula is}} the core formula for the time value of money; {{each of the other}} {{formulae}} is derived from this formula. For example, the annuity formula is the sum of a series of present value calculations.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{assuming}} constant rates, for a simple, non-dividend paying asset, {{the value}} of the futures/forward price, F(t,T), will be found by compounding <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> S(t) at time t to maturity T by the rate of risk-free return r.|$|E
25|$|The {{formula for}} <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> {{of a regular}} stream of future {{payments}} (an annuity) is derived from a sum of the formula for future value of a single future payment, as below, where C is the payment amount and n the period.|$|E
50|$|Of these three, only <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> and {{internal}} {{rate of return}} decision rules consider all of the project's cash flows and the time value of money. As we shall see, only <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> decision rule will always lead to the correct decision when choosing among mutually exclusive projects. This is because <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> {{and internal}} rate of return decision rules differ with respect to their reinvestment rate assumptions. <b>The</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> decision rule implicitly assumes that the project's cash flows can be reinvested at the firm's cost of capital, whereas the {{internal rate of return}} decision rule implicitly assumes that the cash flows can be reinvested at the project's IRR. Since each project is likely to have a different IRR, the assumption underlying <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> decision rule is more reasonable.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{appropriate}} approach to calculating accrual equivalent marginal tax rates for nonaccrual taxes on personal financial investments is the relative-reduction-in-the-internal-rate-of-return approach, which equates <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>values</b> from <b>the</b> after-tax returns from an investment under an accrual and a nonaccrual tax. Detailed comparisons are made with alternative approaches proposed by Boadway, Bruce, and Mintz (1984) and by King and Fullerton (1984) for the capital gains tax. Both find accrual tax rates that equate <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>values</b> of accrual and actual tax revenues. Fundamental problems are found with both alternative approaches. ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> V of any network j to any {{individual}} i {{is equal to}} the sum of <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of <b>the</b> benefit of all transactions less <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of <b>the</b> costs of all transactions on the network over any given period of time t, as shown in the following equation. The value of the entire network is the summary of the value to all users, who are defined as all parties doing transactions on that network.|$|R
25|$|For {{bonds with}} {{multiple}} coupons, {{it is not}} generally possible to solve for yield in terms of price algebraically. A numerical root-finding technique such as Newton's method must be employed to approximate the yield which renders <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of future cash flows equal to the bond price.|$|E
25|$|The {{integral}} term accelerates {{the movement}} of the process towards setpoint and eliminates the residual steady-state error that occurs with a pure proportional controller. However, since the integral term responds to accumulated errors from the past, it can cause <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> to overshoot the setpoint value (see the section on loop tuning).|$|E
25|$|Consider a 30-year {{zero-coupon bond}} {{with a face}} value of $100. If the bond is priced at an annual YTM of 10%, it will cost $5.73 today (<b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of this cash flow, 100/(1.1)30 = 5.73). Over the coming 30 years, the price will advance to $100, and the annualized return will be 10%.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, {{internal}} rate(s) {{of return}} follow from <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> {{as a function}} of the rate of return. This function is continuous. Towards a rate of return of 100% <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> approaches infinity with the sign of the last cash flow, and towards a rate of return of positive infinity <b>the</b> net <b>present</b> <b>value</b> approaches <b>the</b> first cash flow (the one at <b>the</b> <b>present).</b> Therefore, if <b>the</b> first and last cash flow have a different sign there exists an internal rate of return.

The authors find a negative relationship between initial wage levels and wage growth, even after correcting for negative biases in existing estimates of this relationship. They also find that the ratio of <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>values</b> of rising wage profiles to flat wage profiles is generally close to one.

25|$|There are two {{competing}} theories usually advanced for the pricing of credit default swaps. The first, referred to herein as the 'probability model', takes <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> {{of a series}} of cashflows weighted by their probability of non-default. This method suggests that credit default swaps should trade at a considerably lower spread than corporate bonds.|$|E
25|$|From 1982 until 2012, most Western economies {{experienced}} {{a period of}} low inflation combined with relatively high returns on investments across all asset classes including government bonds. This brought {{a certain sense of}} complacency amongst some pension actuarial consultants and regulators, making it seem reasonable to use optimistic economic assumptions to calculate <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of future pension liabilities.|$|E
25|$|A {{discount}} rate or capitalization rate {{is used to}} determine <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of the expected returns of a business. The {{discount rate}} and capitalization rate {{are closely related to}} each other, but distinguishable. Generally speaking, the discount rate or capitalization rate may be defined as the yield necessary to attract investors to a particular investment, given the risks associated with that investment.|$|E

50|$|Fisher-Weil {{duration}} is a {{refinement of}} Macaulay’s duration which {{takes into account}} the term structure of interest rates.

25|$|The {{operation}} of evaluating a present value {{into the future}} value is called capitalization (how much will $100 today be worth in 5 years?). The reverse operation which consists in evaluating <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of a future amount of money is called a discounting (how much $100 that will be received in 5 years- at a lottery, for example -are worth today?).|$|E
25|$|In {{this case}} each cash flow grows {{by a factor}} of (1+g). Similar to the formula for an annuity, <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of a growing annuity (PVGA) uses the same {{variables}} with the addition of g as the rate of growth of the annuity (A is the annuity payment in the first period). This is a calculation that is rarely provided for on financial calculators.|$|E
25|$|These {{equations}} {{are frequently}} combined for particular uses. For example, bonds {{can be readily}} priced using these equations. A typical coupon bond is composed of two types of payments: a stream of coupon payments similar to an annuity, and a lump-sum return of capital {{at the end of}} the bond's maturity—that is, a future payment. The two formulas can be combined to determine <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> of the bond.|$|E
