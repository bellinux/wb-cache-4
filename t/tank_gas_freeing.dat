500|$|After a tank is cleaned, {{provided}} {{that it is}} going to be prepared for entry, it will be purged. Purging is accomplished by pumping inert <b>gas</b> into the <b>tank</b> until hydrocarbons have been sufficiently expelled. Next the <b>tank</b> is <b>gas</b> <b>freed</b> which is usually accomplished by blowing fresh air into the space with portable air powered or water powered air blowers. [...] "Gas freeing" [...] brings the oxygen content of the tank up to 20.8% O2. The inert gas buffer between fuel and oxygen atmospheres ensures they are never capable of ignition. Specially trained personnel monitor the tank's atmosphere, often using hand-held gas indicators which measure the percentage of hydrocarbons present. After a tank is gas-free, it may be further hand-cleaned in a manual process known as mucking. Mucking requires protocols for entry into confined spaces, protective clothing, designated safety observers, and possibly the use of airline respirators.|$|R

During the previous docking at AFO Shipyard in Brest, France, a few weeks before, Golar Patricia had been retrofitted with such an installation.

5000|$|Inert gas is {{produced}} on board crude oil carriers (above 8,000 tonnes)(from Jan 1, 2016) by using either a flue gas system or by burning kerosene in a dedicated inert gas generator. The inert gas system {{is used to}} prevent the atmosphere in cargo tanks or bunkers from coming into the explosive range. IG keeps the oxygen content of the tank atmosphere below 5% (on crude carriers, less for product carriers and gas tankers), thus making any air/hydrocarbon gas mixture in the tank too rich (too high a fuel to oxygen ratio) to ignite. IG is most important during discharging and during the ballast voyage when more hydrocarbon vapour {{is likely to be}} present in the <b>tank</b> atmosphere. Inert <b>gas</b> {{can also be used to}} purge the tank of the volatile atmosphere in preparation for <b>gas</b> <b>freeing</b> - replacing the atmosphere with breathable air - or vice versa.|$|R

40|$|The {{waste tank}} purge {{ventilation}} system for Tank 48 {{is designed to}} prevent dangerous concentrations of hydrogen or benzene from accumulating in the gas space of the tank. Fans pull the gas/water vapor mixture from the <b>tank</b> <b>gas</b> space and pass it sequentially through a demister, a condenser, a reheater, and HEPA filters before discharging to the environment. Proper operation of the HEPA filters requires that the gas mixture passing through them has a low relative humidity. The ventilation system has been modified by increasing {{the capacity of the}} fans and changing the condenser from a two-pass heat exchanger to a single-pass heat exchanger. It is important to understand the impact of these modifications on the operation of the system. A hydraulic model of the ventilation exhaust system has been developed. This model predicts the properties of the air throughout the system and the flowrate through the system, as functions of the <b>tank</b> <b>gas</b> space and environmental conditions. This document serves as a Software Design Report, a Software Coding report, and a User`s Manual.

40|$|Many mud diapirs {{have been}} {{identified}} in the southern Okinawa Trough from a seismic survey using R/V KEXUE I in 2001. The movement and accumulation of <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> related to mud diapirs are discussed in detail by an analysis of fluid potential which is based upon velocity data. It can be found that <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> moves from the higher fluid potential strata to the lower ones and the gas hydrate comes into being during <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> movement meeting the proper criteria of temperature and pressure. In fact, gas hydrates have been found in the upper layers above the mud diapirs and in host rocks exhibiting other geophysical characteristics. As the result of the formation of the <b>gas</b> hydrate, the <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> bearing strata are enclosed by the gas hydrate bearing strata. Due to the high pressure anomalies of the <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> bearing strata the fluid potential increases noticeably. It can then be concluded that the high fluid potential anomaly on the low fluid potential background may be caused by the presence of the <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> below the gas hydrate bearing strata...|$|R

40|$|This master thesis study uses seismic {{modeling}} {{to better}} understand the seismic response of the <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> that accumulates beneath hydrate-bearing sediments. To this end, I developed 12 different geological models ranging from very simple geometries to anticline structures. Within these models, I varied the distribution of <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> in the layers beneath the BSR. Sediment properties were taken from velocity profiles of the Storegga gas hydrate system and the density approximately estimated from a computed Gassmann diagram. Norsar 2 D, Norsar 3 D and Seisrox modeling programs were used to generate PSDM seismic images. Higher frequencies, large incident angle and long horizontal sampling distances has resulted in the generation of BSR as termination of enhanced reflection. The termination of the enhanced reflections coincided with anticlinal and dipping BSR in this study. The presence of intercalation of <b>gas</b> <b>free</b> and hydrate bearing layers above the dipping BSR and <b>gas</b> <b>free</b> and <b>gas</b> bearing sediments below the dipping BSR led to the termination of enhanced reflection at the BGHSZ. Low frequency, near angle and small sampling distances resulted in proper BSR reflections for the geologic setting mentioned above. Lower frequency and large sampling distances results in termination of enhanced reflection of the BSR. A seismic section from Hydratech data was compared to the synthetic seismic model...|$|R

40|$|Generalized {{numerical}} {{models for}} simulating <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> accumulation in marine sediments have been developed. These models include several physical {{processes such as}} phase equilibrium of gas hydrates, multiphase fluid flow in porous media, biogenic methane production, and sedimentation-compaction of sediments over geologic timescales. Non-dimensionalization of the models lead {{to the emergence of}} important dimensionless groups controlling these dynamic systems, such as the Peclet number, Damkohler number, and a sedimentation-compaction group that compares permeability to sedimentation rate. Exploring the entire parameter space of these dimensionless groups helps in delineating different modes of <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> occurrence, e. g., no hydrate and hydrate with or without underlying <b>free</b> <b>gas.</b> Scaling schemes developed for these systems help in summarizing average gas hydrate saturation for hundreds of simulation results into two simple contour plots. The utility of these contour plots in predicting average hydrate saturation is shown through application to different geologic settings. The depth to the sulfate-methane transition (SMT) is also developed as an independent proxy for gas hydrate saturation for deep-source systems. It is shown through numerical modeling that scaled depth to the SMT correlates with the average gas hydrate flux through the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ). Later, analytical theory is developed for calculating steady-state concentration profiles as well as the complete gas hydrate saturation profile from the SMT depth. Application of this theory to several sites along Cascadia Margin indicates that SMT depth {{can be used as a}} fast and inexpensive proxy to get a first-order estimate of gas hydrate saturation, compared to expensive deep-drilling methods. The effect of overpressure development in low permeability gas hydrate systems is shown to have an important effect on <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> saturations. Specifically, overpressure development decreases the net amount of <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> in the system, in addition to extending the base of the hydrate stability zone below the seafloor by a relatively small depth. We also study the role of upward <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> migration in producing long, connected <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> columns beneath the gas hydrate layer. Finally, two-dimensional models are developed to study the effect of heterogeneities on <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> distribution. Simulation results show that hydrate as well as <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> accumulates in relatively high saturations within these high permeability sediments, such as faults/fracture networks, dipping sand layers, and combinations of both, due to focused fluid flow...|$|R
