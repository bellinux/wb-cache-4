5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth.|$|E

The Seabees used backhoes <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> the still-burning plane to rescue survivors and erected mortuary tents for first responders. There was confusion over the administration of the effort; the crash occurred on land owned by the United States Navy but civil authorities initially claimed authority. The hull had disintegrated, and jet fuel in the wing tanks had sparked a fire which was still burning eight hours after impact.|$|E
25|$|When Franklin Richards {{was kidnapped}} by Onslaught, Doom joined the Fantastic Four, Avengers and the X-Men to battle Onslaught in Central Park. An enraged Hulk was able <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> Onslaught's shell. However, Onslaught {{remained}} as pure psionic energy, separated Hulk and Banner, planning to {{spread across the}} planet. Thor Odinson plunged into Onslaught, trying to contain him. The Fantastic Four, {{the majority of the}} Avengers, and the Hulk-less Banner followed in short order, with Doom being forced to join the sacrifice when Iron Man tackled the villain into the energy mass. Thanks to this sacrifice, the X-Men finally managed to destroy Onslaught. Doom, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers and Banner were believed dead but were instead saved by Franklin, who created a pocket dimension called Counter-Earth to keep them safe. After several months away, the missing heroes returned from Counter-Earth, except for Doom, who remained there for a time. Doom uncovers the secret power {{at the heart of the}} planet, an avatar of his arch-foe Reed Richards' son, Franklin, the super-powered youth who conjured this globe and left a bit of himself behind to guide it from within. Doom managed to convince the little boy to relinquish control of this world with little more than a few errant promises of a better life.|$|E
50|$|This {{perennial}} herb has stems up {{to about}} 45 centimeters long. In April and May it produces yellowish or cream-colored flowers with purple-tinged keels.

500|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} and Baudin's black cockatoo {{were once}} known collectively as the white-tailed black cockatoo (C. [...] baudinii) until formally classified as separate species. In a 1933 {{report on the}} birds of Lake Grace, Western Australian naturalist Ivan Carnaby wrote of a distinctive population of white-tailed black cockatoos that he named mallee black cockatoos. These birds lived in mallee and sandplains, using their large bills <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> woody seed pods; the typical form had a long narrow bill it used to extract eucalyptus seeds from red gum seed pods. He classified it as a subspecies of the white-tailed black cockatoo in 1948, giving it the name Calyptorhynchus baudinii latirostris. The epithet latirostris is from the Latin latus [...] "wide" [...] and rostrum [...] "bill". The holotype specimen is from Hopetoun, Western Australia.|$|E

[...] After blackening needles with soot from a burning candle, Lim carefully inserted them into a raw egg and sealed the hole with powder. [...] In his rituals, he passed the egg several times over his client while chanting and asked her <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> the egg. [...] Unaware that the egg had been tampered with, the client would be convinced by the sight of the black needles that evil spirits were harassing her.|$|E
500|$|The {{skull of}} the spotted hyena {{differs from that}} of the striped hyena by its much greater size and {{narrower}} sagittal crest. For its size, the spotted hyena {{has one of the most}} powerfully built skulls among the Carnivora. The dentition is more dual purposed than that of other modern hyena species, which are mostly scavengers; the upper and lower third premolars are conical bone-crushers, with a third bone-holding cone jutting from the lower fourth premolar. The spotted hyena also has its carnassials situated behind its bone-crushing premolars, the position of which allows it to crush bone with its premolars without blunting the carnassials. Combined with large jaw muscles and a special vaulting to protect the skull against large forces, these characteristics give the spotted hyena a powerful bite which can exert a pressure of 80kgf/cm2 (1140 lbf/in²), which is 40% more force than a leopard can generate. The jaws of the spotted hyena outmatch those of the brown bear in bonecrushing ability, and free ranging hyenas have been observed <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> the long bones of giraffes measuring 7cm in diameter. A [...] spotted hyena is estimated to have a bite force of 565.7 newtons at the canine tip and 985.5 newtons at the carnassial eocone. One individual in a study was found to exert a bite force of 4,500 newtons on the measuring instruments.|$|E

2500|$|There are few {{reports of}} gorillas using {{tools in the}} wild. Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) have been {{observed}} using sticks to apparently measure the depth of water and as [...] "walking sticks" [...] to support their posture when crossing deeper water. An adult female used a detached trunk from a small shrub as a stabilizer during food gathering, and another used a log as a bridge. One {{possible explanation for the}} absence of observed tool use in wild gorillas is that they are less dependent on foraging techniques that require the use of tools, since they exploit food resources differently from chimpanzees. Whereas chimpanzees and orangutans feeding involves tools such as hammers <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> nuts and sticks to fish for termites, gorillas access these foods by breaking nuts with their teeth and smashing termite mounds with their hands.|$|E
50|$|In all {{populations of}} sea otters, soft-bodied organisms such as worms and sea stars {{are the least}} likely to be {{consumed}} with the aid of tools. On the other hand, shelled bivalves and snails with shells are the most likely <b>to</b> be <b>cracked</b> <b>open</b> with tools. Otters of the Northern Pacific consume mostly sea urchins and fish, thereby exhibiting less tool use behavior. Otters of the southern Pacific Ocean feed on tougher macro invertebrates such as bivalves.|$|R
30|$|The {{directions}} of maximum amplification are perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>cracks</b> {{and are in}} good agreement with the deformation directions obtained by deformation measurements. Surface geometry alone does not explain high amplification and polarization at sites with pronounced topography (Burjánek et al. 2014). Based on our experience of around 25 investigated unstable slopes, directionality is typically linked <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>cracks</b> (Burjánek et al. 2012, 2017). Nevertheless, an apparent link to the free face of steep slopes is usually found for fractured sites as well, since the fractures {{played a role in}} the formation of the free face.|$|R

2500|$|Oystercatcher mussel feeding {{provides}} an example of how the optimal diet model can be utilized. [...] Oystercatchers forage on mussels and crack them open with their bills. The constraints on these birds are the characteristics of the different mussel sizes. While large mussels provide more energy than small mussels, large mussels are harder <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> due to their thicker shells. This means that while large mussels have a higher energy content (E), they also have a longer handling time (h). The profitability of any mussel is calculated as E/h. [...] The oystercatchers must decide which mussel size will provide enough nutrition to outweigh the cost and energy required to open it. In their study, Meire and Ervynck tried to model this decision by graphing the relative profitabilities of different sized mussels. They came up with a bell-shaped curve, indicating that moderately sized mussels were the most profitable. However, they observed that if an oystercatcher rejected too many small mussels, the time it took to search for the next suitable mussel greatly increased. This observation shifted their bell-curve to the right (Figure 4). [...] However, while this model predicted that oystercatchers should prefer mussels of 50–55mm, the observed data showed that oystercatchers actually prefer mussels of 30–45mm. Meire and Ervynk then realized the preference of mussel size did not only depend on the profitability of the prey, but also on the prey density. After this was accounted for, they found a good agreement between the model's prediction and the observed data.|$|E
2500|$|Mickey Smith {{is first}} {{introduced}} in the series' 2005 première episode, [...] "Rose". When Mickey's girlfriend Rose (Billie Piper) begins investigating a mysterious alien called the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston), Mickey is captured by the alien Nestene Consciousness, from which a living plastic facsimile of him (an 'auton') is created. Mickey, terrified by the revelation that alien life exists, fails to impress the Doctor, who only invites Rose to be his travelling companion in time and space. In the year since Rose absconded with the Doctor, Mickey has been the prime suspect for Rose's disappearance and has become distressed as a result. However, he assists the pair in defeating the Slitheen, a family of extraterrestrial criminals; using his computer hacking skills, he commandeers a military harpoon missile which he targets at 10 Downing Street to kill the Slitheen. Mickey then declines an invitation from the Doctor to join him and Rose in the TARDIS. A much younger Mickey, played by Casey Dyer, appears briefly when Rose attempts to alter her childhood in [...] "Father's Day". In [...] "Boom Town", Mickey later meets up with the Doctor, Rose and new companion Captain Jack (John Barrowman) in Cardiff, where he helps them foil a Slitheen plot. In the series' finale episode [...] "The Parting of the Ways", when Rose becomes stranded at home at the Powell Estate, Mickey uses a recovery truck <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> the TARDIS's console, through which Rose is able to absorb the time vortex and save the universe from an invasion of the hateful mutant alien Daleks.|$|E
2500|$|In 1939 {{the museum}} closed because of World War II. Two {{years later the}} reliefs were taken down and stored elsewhere. At {{the end of the}} war, the pieces of the altar which had been placed in an air-raid shelter near the Berlin zoo fell {{into the hands of the}} Red Army and were taken to the Soviet Union as war trophies. They were stored in the depot of the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad until 1958. In 1959 a large part of the {{collection}} was returned to East Germany (GDR), including the altar fragments. Under the leadership of the museum's then director, Carl Blümel, only the altar was presented as it had been before the war. The other antiquities were newly arranged, not least because the Altes Museum had been destroyed. In October of that year the museum reopened. In 1982 a new entrance area was created which permitted a visit to the museum to begin with the Pergamon Altar. Previously, the entrance had been in the west wing of the building, so that visitors had to pass through the [...] Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin (Middle East Museum) to get to the Pergamon Altar. In 1990, 9 heads from the Telephus frieze, which had been evacuated to the western part of Berlin because of the war, returned to the Pergamon Museum. All these war-related events had negative consequences for the remaining altar and frieze fragments. It also turned out that earlier restorations had created problems. The clamps and fasteners which connected the individual fragments and also served to anchor the frieze and sculpture to the wall were made of iron, which had started to rust. As this rust spread it threatened <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> <b>open</b> the marble from the inside. Restoration became urgent after 1990. From 1994 to 1996 the Telephus frieze, parts of which had not been accessible in the 1980s, was worked on. Afterward the Gigantomachy was restored under the leadership of Silvano Bertolin. First the western frieze, then the northern and southern portions, and finally the eastern frieze were restored, an effort which cost over three million euro. On June 10, 2004 the completely restored frieze was presented for public viewing. The Pergamon altar can now be viewed in a form reflecting current scientific insights.|$|E
