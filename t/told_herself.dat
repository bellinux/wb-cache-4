60|$|She was {{watching}} him, and she <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> the shot {{had gone to}} its mark.|$|E
60|$|But as {{she wrote}} it she <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> that she {{believed}} {{it to be a}} lie.|$|E
60|$|This {{she wrote}} {{on a small}} slip of paper, and then having read it twice, she put it into her pocket-book. She <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> that she ought to send it; but <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> as plainly {{that she could not}} bring herself to do so. It was early in the morning before she went to bed but she had {{admitted}} no one into the room after Montague had left her.|$|E

6000|$|She <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> {{that she}} was the {{daughter}} of a judge, the wife of a doctor, and that she did not care to know a capering tailor. She <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> {{that she was}} not responsive to men [...] . not even to Percy Bresnahan. She <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> that a woman of thirty who heeded a boy of twenty-five was ridiculous. And on Friday, when she had convinced herself that the errand was necessary, she went to Nat Hicks's shop, bearing the not very romantic burden of a pair of her husband's trousers. Hicks was in the back room. She faced the Greek god who, in a somewhat ungodlike way, was stitching a coat on a scaley sewing-machine, in a room of smutted plaster walls.|$|E
60|$|Ruth {{knew nothing}} of these things. She <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> {{that it was her}} abruptness that had driven Bailey away.|$|E

6000|$|... 'She <b>told</b> me <b>herself</b> what I well knew before. She {{does not}} reflect enough to take it seriously, and contrives to lay the blame upon the narrowness of Miss Charlecote's training.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do {{you know}} about it, Aunt Wee? You talk as if Mrs. Eppyra--or {{whatever}} her name is--had <b>told</b> you <b>herself.</b> Did she?" [...] asked Daisy, feeling more interested in the brown spider.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> {{that she}} had {{everything}} in the world. And after each self-rebuke she stumbled again on [...] "I just wonder----" ...|$|E
60|$|Marjorie <b>told</b> <b>herself,</b> as she {{had been}} trained to tell herself, to be sensible, but {{something}} within her repeated: there is love.|$|E
6000|$|... "James is {{not really}} cynical," [...] she <b>told</b> <b>herself.</b> [...] "He says things, not because he means them, but because he likes to startle people." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He is worshipping that horrid orchid," [...] she <b>told</b> <b>herself,</b> {{and waited}} ten minutes. [...] "His watch must have stopped. I will go and call him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That thing's going on," [...] she <b>told</b> <b>herself.</b> [...] "Everything goes on, {{confound}} it! One doesn't {{change anything}} one has set going by making good resolutions." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was an odd}} wooing, as Tommy laughingly <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> {{when she}} came to think it over in her room that night. But that is how it shaped itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, mother, {{she is so}} funny!--Come, Addi-lay, let her {{hear your}} fun," [...] said the girl, taking her guest's hand and leading {{her back to the}} hall. [...] "Her name is Addi-lay. I know, for she <b>told</b> me <b>herself.</b> We quite {{understand}} each other already.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is all that," [...] {{said the}} Franco-Pole, energetically; [...] "every franc of it, beside the house! I know it. She <b>told</b> me <b>herself.</b> Yes. What woman would risk that, you know; and his life, you may say, {{as good as}} gone? Of course they were lies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s understandable," [...] agreed Captain Barber, [...] "but it’s orkard. Instead o’ being a mild, amiable sort o’ woman, all smiles, {{the fear}} o’ losing me has changed ’er into a determined, jealous woman. She <b>told</b> me <b>herself</b> {{it was love}} of me as ’ad changed her." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{never had}} another lover. She <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> {{that she would}} always be {{faithful}} to the one love of her life. This sounded romantic, and she found a certain comfort in it.|$|E
60|$|If {{all else}} failed her, she <b>told</b> <b>herself,</b> {{there would be}} no Touraine hovel for her. She could always be Comtesse de Tressan. Let Marius work out alone the {{punishment}} of his cowardice.|$|E
60|$|She {{wanted to}} {{massacre}} him, {{but at the}} same time she <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> that the poor dear must be feeling very, very ill, and should have a reasonable respite before the slaughter commenced.|$|E
60|$|Hetty's {{mind was}} unequal to a {{sustained}} discussion, and accustomed {{to defer to}} the directions of her seniors she did as <b>told,</b> seating <b>herself</b> passively on a log {{by the side of}} the Sumach, and averting her face from the painful scene that was occurring within the circle.|$|R
60|$|This was all--literally all--that she <b>told</b> me of <b>herself.</b> I {{have never}} {{discovered}} {{more of her}} sad story from that day to this.|$|R
60|$|She {{was happy}} and useful, was prospering {{as she had}} hoped. That was all she <b>told</b> me of <b>herself.</b> The rest {{referred}} to me.|$|R
60|$|He {{started off}} bareheaded. Estella {{followed}} {{him up the}} road breathlessly. Surely it was the strangest walk ever a girl had, she <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> with mirthless laughter. She pushed the key into his hand at the porch.|$|E
6000|$|... "This job may {{not last}} long," [...] she <b>told</b> <b>herself,</b> [...] "but while {{it does it}} will be mighty amusing. I shall enjoy these weeks in a quiet country town after the bustle of the big city." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{went down}} the hill to where his ball lay. Eunice {{proceeded}} direct for the green. Much as she <b>told</b> <b>herself</b> that she hated this man, she never questioned his ability to get there with his next shot.|$|E
60|$|This may, he hopes, be {{a pledge}} for the credit of the rest, though {{the latter part}} of her history lay abroad, and could not be so well vouched as the first; yet, as she has <b>told</b> it <b>herself,</b> we have the less reason to {{question}} the truth of that part also.|$|R
6000|$|... "And Alice <b>herself</b> <b>told</b> {{me to go}} {{and look}} after them," [...] {{interposed}} Mavering. He suppressed, a little uncandidly, the fact of her first reluctance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, {{of course}} I'm sure. Aunt Nesta <b>told</b> me <b>herself.</b> There can't {{possibly}} be a mistake, {{because it was}} Skinner who let her in when she called on Mrs. Crocker. Uncle Peter told me about it. He had a talk with {{the man in the}} hall and found that he was a baseball enthusiast--" ...|$|R
