This group contains both the Rove and Gunflint Iron formations. The Rove Formation is {{the youngest of the}} many Animikie layers; it consists of gently tilted fine-grained sediments. It is composed of greywackes and black shale, and contains lower concentrations of iron and <b>taconite</b> than the underlying Gunflint Iron Formation does.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgerald had {{no system}} {{to monitor the}} {{presence}} or amount of water in her cargo hold, {{even though there was}} always some present. The intensity of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water {{reached the top of the}} <b>taconite</b> cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo. The Marine Board noted that because Fitzgerald lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost freeboard (the level of a ship's deck above the water).|$|E
5|$|Elcor sat atop {{a bed of}} <b>taconite</b> {{consisting}} of a uniform mixture of about 30% iron, interspersed with pockets of high-grade ore, {{a part of the}} Biwabik iron formation. The Biwabik iron formation is a large sheet of iron-bearing sediment deposited during the Precambrian era {{on the bottom of the}} Animikie Sea. This iron-bearing rock extends under Lake Superior from the Mesabi and Vermilion Iron Ranges, to the Gogebic Iron Range from northern Wisconsin into the Marquette Range of the upper peninsula of Michigan, and west to the manganese-rich ore of the Cuyuna Iron Range. Michigan's steel-blue high grade ores were quite different from the Mesabi ore, which was soft brown hematite. There is iron in other areas of Minnesota, but no longer in quantities that are practical to mine.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{structure}} of the range {{is that of a}} monocline dipping 5 to 15 degrees to the southeast. Key faults include the Calumet, La Rue, Morton, Biwabik, and the Siphon. The Duluth Gabbro complex to the east has caused metamorphic changes in the Biwabik formation. The natural iron ores and the magnetite <b>taconites</b> occur in this Precambrian Biwabik formation, which is a cherty layer 340-750 ft thick. The natural ores are located in elongated channels or tabular deposits, while the magnetite <b>taconites</b> occur in stratigraphic zones. Natural ores have an iron content of 51 to 57 per cent while the pellets contain 60 to 67 per cent. The natural ores are mainly mixtures of hematite and goethite. The most common silicate is Minnesotaite. Also of note are the presence of algal structures in the Biwabik formation.|$|R

5000|$|Iron Range refers collectively or {{individually}} to {{a number}} of elongated iron-ore mining districts around Lake Superior in the United States and Canada. Despite the word [...] "range," [...] the iron ranges are not mountain chains, but outcrops of Precambrian sedimentary formations containing high percentages of iron. [...] These cherty iron ore deposits are Precambrian in age for the Vermilion Range, while middle Precambrian in age for the Mesabi and Cuyuna Ranges. Similarly, the Gogebic Range in Wisconsin and the Marquette Iron Range and Menominee Range in Michigan. Natural ores and concentrates were produced from 1848 until the mid 1950s, when <b>taconites</b> and jaspers were concentrated and pelletized started to become the major source of iron production.|$|R
5|$|Minnesota's {{earliest}} industries were fur {{trading and}} agriculture. The city of Minneapolis grew around the flour mills powered by St. Anthony Falls. Although {{less than one}} percent of the population is now employed in the agricultural sector, it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking sixth in the nation in the value of products sold. The state is the U.S.'s largest producer of sugar beets, sweet corn, and green peas for processing, and farm-raised turkeys. Minnesota is also a large producer of corn and soybeans. Minnesota has the most food cooperatives per capita in the United States. Forestry remains strong, including logging, pulpwood processing and paper production, and forest products manufacturing. Minnesota was famous for its soft-ore mines, which produced a significant portion of the world's iron ore for over a century. Although the high-grade ore is now depleted, <b>taconite</b> mining continues, using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2004, the state produced 75 percent of the country's usable iron ore. The mining boom created the port of Duluth which continues to be important for shipping ore, coal, and agricultural products. The manufacturing sector now includes technology and biomedical firms in addition to the older food processors and heavy industry. The nation's first indoor shopping mall was Edina's Southdale Center and its largest is Bloomington's Mall of America.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{production}} continued steadily {{for many}} more decades; by the 1950s traditional iron mines had exhausted most of their resources. It had been known for many years that northern Minnesota had an ore called <b>taconite,</b> which could be refined into iron through a process called beneficiation. A <b>taconite</b> processing plant was built further north along the North Shore at Silver Bay, and it quickly became the major <b>taconite</b> shipping port. Minnesota <b>taconite</b> produces {{over half of the}} iron mined in Minnesota at the present date.|$|E

40|$|Mining is {{the process}} or {{industry}} of extracting valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth. The nature of mining creates a potential {{negative impact on the}} environment both during the mining operations and several years after the mine is closed. Over the years regulations designed to moderate the negative effects are adopted, and environmental issues and challenges have gotten more attention. The mining industries aim to improve production efficiency {{and at the same time}} take care of the environment according to best practice. The latter is the subject in this thesis, which aims to look at Sydvaranger Gruve AS’s use of chemical treatment of process water within the mining industry. Flocculants and coagulants are chemicals that are used in water treatment in many industries. In this approach the water resource is limited and the aim is to treat the process water in order to recirculate it. Despite the same mineral being processed the process water will not have the same properties due to the huge variations of influencing factors. Some theory regarding water treatment with chemicals exists, but there are still many assumptions and a lack of understanding. There are many chemicals on the market and it requires a lot of testing to assure that the most efficient chemical is used in the process water treatment. Sydvaranger Gruve AS is a mining company located North in Norway close to the Russian border. The company has a history that dates back over a hundred years and it is known for its pioneering development of technology to process <b>taconites,</b> which is a low-grade ore. Sydvaranger Gruve AS is currently using a cationic coagulant with low molecular weight, Magnafloc LT 38, in combination with a slightly anionic flocculent with a medium molecular weight, Magnafloc 10. The study presented in this thesis is based on existing literature, though the previous work in this area has proved to be limited. It is challenging to conclude the specific chemical reaction due to lack of literature, but assumptions will be made based on theory. In this thes{{is the process}} is presented in the form of description and flowcharts. Influencing factors regarding the process and geology are identified and discussed. The existing theory regarding chemical water treatment is presented and various chemical products for water treatment are gathered from different suppliers. The procedure for testing is presented, the testing is performed in three main stages and are evaluated both quantitative and qualitative. A lot of effort has been put into finding a suitable chemical or a combination of chemicals and many chemicals were tested through experimental work. Zetag 8187, a strongly cationic flocculent with a medium high molecular weight, is the chemical that has shown the best result and has been examined further to compare its behavior against the chemicals in use today. A quality assurance has been performed to illustrate the reliability of the test methods and procedures despite the large variations in the influencing factors. A risk assessment based on environmental issues has been done on the final chemical recommendation, Zetag 8187, versus the chemicals that are in use today, Magnafloc 10 and Magnafloc LT 38, in order to see if there are any environmental benefits by substitution of chemicals, other than performance. The results are presented and final recommendations are made based on the tests and other observations. Despite proving good results in small-scale tests, extensive plant scale tests should be carried out to verify the results shown in the thesis...|$|R

25|$|Women are not {{necessarily}} sympathetic to female complainants who have been sexually harassed. If the harasser was male, internalized sexism (or jealousy over the sexual attention towards the victim) may encourage some women to react with as much hostility towards the complainant as some male colleagues. Fear of being targeted for harassment or retaliation themselves may also cause some women to respond with hostility. For example, when Lois Jenson filed her lawsuit against Eveleth <b>Taconite</b> Co., the women shunned her both at work and in the community—many of these women later joined her suit. Women may even project hostility onto the victim in order to bond with their male coworkers and build trust.|$|E
