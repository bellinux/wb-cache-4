40|$|AbstractIron {{responsive}} elements (IREs) {{are short}} stem-loop structures found in several mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cellular iron metabolism. Iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) control iron homeostasis through differential binding to <b>the</b> <b>IREs,</b> accommodating any sequence or structural variations that <b>the</b> <b>IREs</b> may present. Here we report {{the structure of}} IRP 1 in complex with transferrin receptor 1 B (TfR B) IRE, and {{compare it to the}} complex with ferritin H (Ftn H) <b>IRE.</b> <b>The</b> two <b>IREs</b> are bound to IRP 1 through nearly identical protein-RNA contacts, although their stem conformations are significantly different. These results support the view that binding of different IREs with IRP 1 depends both on protein and RNA conformational plasticity, adapting to RNA variation while retaining conserved protein-RNA contacts...|$|R

40|$|Iron influx {{increases}} {{the translation of}} the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein (APP) via an iron-responsive element (IRE) RNA stem loop in its 5 ′-untranslated region. Equal modulated interaction of the iron regulatory proteins (IRP 1 and IRP 2) with canonical IREs controls iron-dependent translation of the ferritin subunits. However, our immunoprecipitation RT-PCR and RNA binding experiments demonstrated that IRP 1, but not IRP 2, selectively bound <b>the</b> APP <b>IRE</b> in human neural cells. This selective IRP 1 interaction pattern was evident in human brain and blood tissue from normal and Alzheimer disease patients. We computer-predicted an optimal novel RNA stem loop structure for the human, rhesus monkey, and mouse APP IREs with reference to <b>the</b> canonical ferritin <b>IREs</b> but also <b>the</b> <b>IREs</b> encoded by erythroid heme biosynthetic aminolevulinate synthase and Hif- 2 α mRNAs, which preferentially bind IRP 1. Selective 2 ′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension analysis was consistent with a 13 -base single-stranded terminal loop and a conserved GC-rich stem. Biotinylated RNA probes deleted of the conserved CAGA motif in the terminal loop did not bind to IRP 1 relative to wild type probes and could no longer base pair to form a predicted AGA triloop. An AGU pseudo-triloop is key for IRP 1 binding to <b>the</b> canonical ferritin <b>IREs.</b> RNA probes encoding <b>the</b> APP <b>IRE</b> stem loop exhibited the same high affinity binding to rhIRP 1 as occurs for <b>the</b> H-ferritin <b>IRE</b> (35 pm). Intracellular iron chelation increased binding of IRP 1 to <b>the</b> APP <b>IRE,</b> decreasing intracellular APP expression in SH-SY 5 Y cells. Functionally, shRNA knockdown of IRP 1 caused increased expression of neural APP consistent with IRP 1 -APP IRE-driven translation...|$|R
50|$|The upper helix of <b>the</b> known <b>IREs</b> shows {{stronger}} {{conservation of}} structure {{compared to the}} lower helix. The bases composing the helixes are variable. The mid-stem bulged C is a highly characteristic feature (though this has been seen to be a G in <b>the</b> ferritin <b>IRE</b> for lobster). <b>The</b> apical loop of <b>the</b> known <b>IREs</b> all consist of either the AGA or AGU triplet. This is pinched by a paired G-C and there is additionally a bulged U, C or A in the upper helix. The crystal structure and NMR data show a bulged U in the lower stem of <b>the</b> ferritin <b>IRE.</b> This {{is consistent with the}} predicted secondary structure. IREs in many other mRNAs do not have any support for this bulged U. Consequently, two RFAM models have been created for the IRE—one with a bulged U and one without.|$|R
