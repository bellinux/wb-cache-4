25|$|The {{first step}} in the {{physical}} design flow is Floorplanning. Floorplanning is the process of identifying structures that should be placed close together, and allocating space for them in such a manner as to meet the sometimes conflicting goals of available space (cost of the chip), required performance, and the desire to have everything close <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{his review}} (collected in The Present as History, 1953) Marxist Paul Sweezy joked that Hayek {{would have you}} believe that if there was an {{over-production}} of baby carriages, the central planners would then order the population to have more babies instead of simply warehousing the temporary excess of carriages and decreasing production for next year. The cybernetic arguments of Stafford Beer in his 1974 CBC Massey Lectures, Designing Freedom – that intelligent adaptive planning can increase freedom – are of interest in this regard, as is the technical work of Herbert A. Simon and Albert Ando on the dynamics of hierarchical nearly decomposable systems in economics – namely, that everything in such a system is not tightly coupled <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E

Richard Harrington of The Washington Post said the album consists of gothic rock songs with brooding lyrics and Lee's vocals accompanied by pianos, strings and choirs. Other genres present on the album are heavy metal, opera and pop music. Jim Farber of Daily News explained, [...] "Evanescence's music again isn't quite metal (unless you think Creed qualifies).

Supervising producer Josh Singer later noted how [...] "August" [...] helped them write the rest of the season, [...] "There was one episode, 'August', which was all about the Observers, that I feel was mythology without being mythology. And somehow, in working that episode, we sort of found a new creative vein. And it's not that that episode was necessarily so related <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> we did.

Pop Shock reviewed Stan's second studio album, Unlocked, in late 2014, where they commended that [...] "Vanilla Chocolat" [...] {{was one of}} the best songs of the album. They felt that [...] "everything about this track is pure pop perfection – from the playful French bits, to the Bollywood-inspired chorus. It also sounds completely different <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> in the charts right now." [...] Pop Shock were initially disappointed by the video being [...] "Selfie cam", but they went on to say that [...] "it holds up to multiple viewings and suits the joyous nature of the song". German website Hitfire reported the video premiere of [...] "Vanilla Chocolat" [...] on 1 January 2015, where they praised the catchy dance-pop beat incorporated in the refrain of the song and its [...] "easy-to-sing", but at the same time [...] "nonsense" [...] lyrics".

In {{his review of}} The Open Door, Ed Thompson of the website IGN, stated that the fans who were [...] "looking for the full-blown piano ballad" [...] reminiscent of [...] "My Immortal" [...] (2004) {{had to wait until}} the album's final track. He added {{that at the end of}} the album they were awarded with [...] "not only the most beautiful song on the album, but also the most unique song Lee has ever released." [...] He further said, [...] "despite Lee's voice giving the tune a funereal cast, there is no hiding the fact that the lyrics are of an upbeat nature. 'Shouldn't have to torture me so sweetly, now I can't let go of this dream, I can't breathe but I feel good enough, I feel good enough for you.'" [...] Bill Lamb of the website About.com, put the song in his list of Top Tracks from The Open Door along with [...] "Sweet Sacrifice", [...] "Call Me When You're Sober", [...] "Your Star" [...] and [...] "Lacrymosa". Jon Dolan from Entertainment Weekly said that [...] " [...] the deceptively soft 'Good Enough' flirts again with the dark side, offering 'Drink up sweet decadence / I can't say no to you' and striking a final note of cathartic badness." [...] Kathy McCabe of The Daily Telegraph wrote that Lee's [...] "newfound confidence" [...] is evident in the song. In his review of The Open Door, Andree Farias of Christianity Today concluded that though the song [...] "leaves a sweet taste in your mouth", it may not mean much in [...] "a scheme." [...] He added that the song stands as a contrast <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> in the album.|$|E

It is common for values to be positively autocorrelated at shorter distances and negative autocorrelated at longer distances. This is commonly known as Tobler's first law of geography, summarized as [...] "everything is related <b>to</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else,</b> but nearby objects are more related than distant objects".|$|E
