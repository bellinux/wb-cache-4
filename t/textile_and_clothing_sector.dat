As a matter of fact it is a result of a public private partnership in order to grow at that time the <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>sector</b> which {{is one of the}} key sectors in Morocco and rise to the challenge of competition. This partnership was such a successful model for the emerging schools that are today following the same concept.ESITH is the only engineering school in Morocco that provides a comprehensive program about textile engineering with internships for students at the Canadian Group CTT. In addition to other languages, ESITH teaches Spanish as a required subject.|$|E

Abernathy (Gordon McKay Research Professor of Mechanical Engineering and Abbott and James Lawrence Research Professor of Engineering), {{a professor}} of fluid mechanics, were commissioned by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union to undertake a summer study of the competitiveness of the men’s suit industry. The study focused {{on the need to}} encourage research and development on the creation (and later the adoption) of technology in the <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>sector.</b> Eventually Dunlop’s and Abernathy’s efforts {{led to the creation of}} the Tailored Clothing and Technology Corporation TC2, a government-business-labor organization, funded cooperatively the three parties. TC2 initially funded development of new technologies for the industry. It later turned to a broader focus on encouraging the use of existing technology among clothing manufacturers and textile producers.TC2 is discussed in the Commentary of Dunlop, Industrial Relations Systems, Revised Edition (Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press, 1993), pp. 36-37. In 1989, TC2 changed its name to the Textile and Clothing Technology Corporation to reflect its expanded mission. The group, now based in Raleigh, North Carolina, remains active in this area.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the firm-specific factors {{that account for}} the decision to invest in low-wage countries {{on the part of}} Italian firms in the <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>sector.</b> This analysis is motivated by the fact that our survey data show, between 1990 and 1997, a decline of average employment in parent companies, while that in subsidiaries grew substantially. However, correlation and regression analysis show that employment in parent companies that invested in low-wage countries only seems to be negatively related with employment abroad. Our hypothesis is that investments in cheap labour countries are mainly cost-driven and are undertaken by firms that focus on a low-quality, low-cost strategy. We test this hypothesis through a probit analysis. The evidence suggests that investments to cheap labour countries {{are more likely to be}} of a vertical type, being relatively more labour-intensive compared with the parent company. Our hypothesis seems to be confirmed empirically. Investments in low-wage countries are more likely to generate abundant intra-firm trade and to be undertaken by firms with low shares of skilled employment.

40|$|Abstract: Since the 1950 s, {{global trade}} in <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> {{has seen the}} {{evolution}} of a global system of bilateral quotas governing North-South trade in <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> wearing apparel. As of 2005, these have been removed {{under the terms of the}} 1995 Agreement on <b>Textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clothing.</b> In theory, the ATC was to have led to a smooth and progressive liberalization in the sector. In reality and especially when looking at trade flows from China, it appears that political leaders throughout the ATC period instead backloaded the problem of adjustment, delaying much of it until the very end of the ATC. In this paper, we explore econometrically the evolution of market access conditions in the <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>sectors</b> (T&C). Working with a panel of bilateral trade data on <b>textile</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> trade, underlying bilateral tariffs, and the coverage of quotas under the WTOs Agreement on <b>Textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clothing</b> (ATC) we first develop an estimation framework for calculating the tax equivalents of ATC quota restrictions on bilateral trade. Within this framework, we track the price impact of the quotas through the ten year phase-out period.

Finally, as these quotas are a potentially significant omitted variable, the ATC episode provides us with an opportunity to examine the impact of bilateral quotas on the econometric estimation of trade elasticities...|$|R

40|$|Deindustrialisation {{is taking}} an {{increasingly}} prominent place in public French discourses and {{has raised the}} question of the state’s capacity to spur the country’s industrial rejuvenation. This article views with scepticism the possibility for a state-led reindustrialisation as it finds that deindustrialisation has historically constituted an industrial strategy endorsed by French policy-makers themselves. More precisely, this article argues that deindustrialisation is an industrial strategy that involves a state-sponsored disengagement from specific manufacturing activities in order to rationalise the sector and render it apt to confront international competition. This strategy, as it is argued, is conditioned by two main factors: the scarcity of resources that can potentially be distributed to industrial firms and secondly the resistance of workers and businesses in declining sectors that threaten the political legitimacy of governments. To illustrate this claim the article proposes an examination of the Ministry of Industry’s archives between 1974 and 1984 in order to trace the process industrial policy-making enacted towards the <b>Textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clothing</b> <b>Sector.</b> It is found that the consecutive governments of the decade under examination pursued a targeted deindustrialisation of the sector while simultaneously devising strategies aimed at minimising the political costs of this policy preference on the governing authorities...|$|R

There is always an environmental impact of the textile products, across the entire lifecycle. The most important environmental hazards from textiles are: use of chemicals, use of water, use of energy, generation of waste water contaminated with hazardous substances, hazardous and toxic waste generation. The <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>sector</b> {{is an important part of}} European manufacturing industry. Many of the new member states are very dependent upon the <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> industry in terms of value added and employment. Nevertheless, the total EU export in <b>textiles</b> <b>and</b> <b>clothing</b> decreased while the import increased dramatically over the last years. The European textile industry has been facing a long period of decline, rising global competition, and relocation to low-income countries. Compared to the other main producers of <b>textiles,</b> like China <b>and</b> India, for instance, the European textile industry is disadvantaged due to the high labour costs and higher environmental standards. There are a lot of regulations regarding environmental impact of the textile products, to the level of European Union, like in other few developed countries. All these regulations are necessary for the protection of the environment and consumer protection, in the context of sustainable development, and it should be harmonized and mandatory for all.
