5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} with three or more boards. The game is played {{in exactly the same}} way as normal bughouse with boards placed with {{alternating}} colours and two players and one clock per board. On capturing a piece however, the player has to decide which player of the team will get <b>that</b> <b>piece.</b> In three board bughouse chess the middle player is the key since he gets material from two boards, but has to decide how to divide the captured pieces. The middle board also commonly becomes very cramped due to having twice the number of pieces available.|$|E
5|$|A player {{capturing}} a piece immediately passes <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps {{these pieces}} in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place {{one of these}} pieces on the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces {{on the table in}} front of the board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E
5|$|Although the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars {{failed to}} {{circulate}} to any degree, except {{in and around}} Nevada casinos, where they took the place of privately issued tokens. There are no dollars dated 1975; coins from that year and from 1976 bear a double date 1776–1976, and a special reverse by Dennis R. Williams {{in honor of the}} bicentennial of American independence. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress authorized the Susan B. Anthony dollar, struck beginning in 1979, but <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> also failed to circulate. Due to their modest cost and the short length of the series, sets of Eisenhower dollars are becoming more popular among collectors.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, The Internationale replaced the Tautiška giesmė. When in 1944 'The Internationale' {{have been replaced}} by State Anthem of the Soviet Union in Soviet Union as official anthem, Tautiška giesmė was used as official anthem for the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. An alternate anthem was created and introduced in 1950. The music for <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> was composed by Balys Dvarionas and Jonas Švedas, and the words were written originally by Antanas Venclova. Following Stalin's death in 1953, its lyrics were modified by Vacys Reimeris to remove reference to the former dictator. This anthem stated that Lenin had lit the path to freedom, helped by the Russian people, and exhorted the Lithuanian people to work with peoples of the other Soviet Republics. The anthem was confirmed in Article 169 of the 1978 Constitution of the Lithuanian SSR. The song continued to be used until Lithuania broke away from the Soviet Union. Already in 1988, the Tautiška giesmė was suggested as a replacement for the Soviet Lithuanian anthem. After preliminary approval by the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR and successive legislative bodies, its status as the national anthem was reconfirmed in 1992. In that year, the Constitution of Lithuania was approved; Article 19 of the document states that Tautiška giesmė will be the national anthem of Lithuania. The last law in relation to the national anthem was passed in 1999; it contained the official lyrics and protocol on how and when to play the anthem.|$|E

25|$|However, it {{can capture}} a piece only if <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> is {{unprotected}} (this rule prevents {{the game from}} starting with checkmate).|$|E

25|$|Jacinto Port Boulevard to State Highway 225 - the {{frontage}} roads do {{not cross}} the Houston Ship Channel (and thus <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> of Beltway 8 was removed in 1978).|$|E
50|$|All of {{the pieces}} are anonymous. Ernest Brenneke noted <b>that</b> one <b>piece</b> is {{apparently}} paraphrased from a piece by Giles Farnaby, and speculated on stylistic grounds <b>that</b> other <b>pieces</b> in the collection could be his.|$|R
50|$|The game {{belongs to}} the {{draughts}} family, and its closest relatives are Italian draughts and Dablot Prejjesne. These games have the common feature <b>that</b> <b>pieces</b> can only capture enemy pieces of the same rank or lower.|$|R
50|$|Dragonfly on the hex {{board is}} played {{the same as}} Dragonfly 7×7, except <b>that</b> <b>pieces</b> move and capture as in Gliński's {{hexagonal}} chess (with the exceptions that pawns have no initial double-step option, and castling is permitted).|$|R
25|$|A rarely {{occurring}} and high-scoring {{feature of}} Hong Kong Mahjong is a move called robbing the Kong. If a player declares a Kong (by melding it or adding a fourth piece to a Pong {{to form a}} Kong or declaring a concealed Kong) and another player(s) can use <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> to complete a hand (which by logic {{could not be used}} to form a Pong or Kong as two players cannot make a Pong out of the same tile), a player may steal <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> from that player when declaring the Kong and go Mahjong (win the hand).|$|E
25|$|<b>That</b> <b>piece</b> was {{the first}} to {{identify}} the leak as a possible White House crime and the first to characterize the leak as evidence that within the Bush administration political expedience trumped national security.|$|E
25|$|Rubinstein warned his {{students}} continually {{to guard against}} timidity, not to stop at a difficult place in a composition but to leave it and press ahead. He also encouraged them to write in sketches with indications of whatever form in which <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> would be written and to avoid composing at the piano. Notable students include pianist Sandra Drouker.|$|E
50|$|The idea of minimalism is {{much larger}} than many people realize. It {{includes}}, by definition, any music that works with limited or minimal materials: <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> use only a few notes, <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> use only {{a few words of}} text, or pieces written for very limited instruments, such as antique cymbals, bicycle wheels, or whiskey glasses. It includes <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> sustain one basic electronic rumble for a long time. It includes pieces made exclusively from recordings of rivers and streams. It includes <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> move in endless circles. It includes <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> set up an unmoving wall of saxophone sound. It includes <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> take a very long time to move gradually from one kind of music to another kind. It includes <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> permit all possible pitches, as long as they fall between C and D. It includes <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> slow the tempo down to two or three notes per minute.|$|R
50|$|Hidden {{information}} in the game consists of {{the true nature of}} the underside of <b>pieces</b> <b>that</b> have been onboarded. The significance of this information is <b>that</b> <b>pieces</b> can be flipped at the start of a move possibly changing the direction they can travel or possibly transforming a blank into a weapon. This information is revealed in the course of the game as pieces are flipped, captured, and onboarded.|$|R
50|$|In 1888, a {{suspension}} bridge was {{built over the}} Connecticut River between Brattleboro and Chesterfield. It lasted until 1936, when it was heavily damaged by a flood. Divers have confirmed <b>that</b> <b>pieces</b> of the old bridge still lie on the riverbed under the current bridges.|$|R
25|$|Leduc {{was first}} {{established}} in 1899, when Robert Telford, a settler, bought land near a lake which would later bear his name. It was on <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> of land {{where the new}} settlement would take root. Telford previously served as an officer for the North-West Mounted Police, and later became Leduc's first postmaster, first general merchantman, and first justice of the peace.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{the problem}} of foam shed had not been fully cured; on STS-114, {{additional}} cameras mounted on the tank recorded a piece of foam separated from one of its Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramps, which are designed to prevent unsteady air flow underneath the tank’s cable trays and pressurization lines during ascent. The PAL ramps consist of manually sprayed layers of foam, {{and are more likely}} to become a source of debris. <b>That</b> <b>piece</b> of foam did not impact the orbiter.|$|E
25|$|Japanese and Korean Mahjong {{have some}} special rules. A player cannot win by a discard if that player had already {{discarded}} <b>that</b> <b>piece,</b> where players' discards {{are kept in}} neat rows in front of them. Players may declare ready, meaning that they need one tile to win, cannot change their hand and win extra points if they win. Some rules may replace some of the number 5 tiles with red tiles, as they can earn more points. Korean Mahjong does not allow melded (stolen) chows.|$|E
50|$|The {{direction}} <b>that</b> <b>pieces</b> move {{is determined}} by the color that is facing up. Some of the pieces have different markers on their two sides. Those pieces can be flipped over {{at the start of a}} move, which changes the direction they can travel.|$|R
5000|$|Singer Francesca Chiara is {{in charge}} of the {{graphics}} and invented [...] "Rain", her 3D alter-ego. Being a born writer, she wrote a fictional story ("The Angel and the Rain") <b>that</b> <b>pieces</b> all the songs together and is included in the bands debut album booklet.|$|R
30|$|Both SEM (Fig.  2) and CLSM (Fig.  3) images showed <b>that</b> <b>pieces</b> of the {{residues}} {{were smaller}} for probiotic-treated DDGS samples than for untreated DDGS samples. The fiber-starch-protein complex structure of DDGS was destroyed, {{and the content}} of RS and fiber was obviously decreased after SSF.|$|R
25|$|Promotion is {{effected}} {{by turning the}} piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its promoted rank. Promoting a piece {{has the effect of}} changing how <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> moves. See below. For example, promoting a kirin turns it into a lion, and thereafter it behaves exactly like the original lion, even for the lion-trading rules. (Which can be a reason to defer promotion of a kirin.) A rook obtained by promoting a gold differs from an original rook, though, by that the latter can still promote (to dragon horse), while the former cannot.|$|E
25|$|In July 1854 Liszt {{stated in}} his essay about Berlioz and Harold in Italy that not all music was {{programme}} music. If, {{in the heat of}} a debate, a person would {{go so far as to}} claim the contrary, it would be better to put all ideas of programme music aside. But it would be possible to take means like harmony, modulation, rhythm, instrumentation and others to let a musical motif endure a fate. In any case, a programme should be added to a piece of music only if it was necessarily needed for an adequate understanding of <b>that</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1924, Harry Abbott opened The Abbott School of Aviation on <b>that</b> <b>piece</b> of land. Soon, {{it became}} a small grass strip runway airport for the RAF and several flying clubs which, over time, grew to include the Hong Kong Flying Club, the Far East Flying Training School, and the Aero Club of Hong Kong, which exist today as an {{amalgamation}} known as the Hong Kong Aviation Club. In 1928, a concrete slipway was built for seaplanes that used the adjoining Kowloon Bay. The first control tower and hangar at Kai Tak were built in 1935. In 1936, the first domestic airline in Hong Kong was established.|$|E
50|$|A five-pointed star or pentagram is used {{which makes}} for ten points or spaces on the board <b>that</b> <b>pieces</b> can be dropped and moved upon. There is one vulture piece, and seven crow pieces. The vulture and crows must be of {{different}} color or distinguishable objects.|$|R
50|$|Because the Gomco clamp is made {{of three}} major parts, {{there is a chance}} <b>that</b> <b>pieces</b> could be {{incorrectly}} assembled from differently-sized units or those produced by different manufacturers. Using mismatched parts results in a device that might not sufficiently crush the foreskin, potentially resulting in bleeding.|$|R
5000|$|The Ancient Greeks {{already knew}} <b>that</b> <b>pieces</b> of amber could attract {{lightweight}} particles after being rubbed. The amber becomes electrified by triboelectric effect, mechanical separation of charge in a dielectric. The Greek word for amber is ἤλεκτρον ("ēlektron") {{and is the}} origin of the word [...] "electricity".|$|R
