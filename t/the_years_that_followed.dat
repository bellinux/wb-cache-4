Each man acknowledged the primary impact of the character to have been on their mutual friendship and intellectual understanding. In particular, their time developing the Anarky series led to a working relationship centered on esoteric debate, discussion, and mutual respect.|$|E

5|$|By 1963, when President John F. Kennedy began pushing Congress {{to finally}} build the Fort Circle Drive, many in Washington and the National Park Service were openly {{questioning}} whether the plan had outgrown its usefulness. After all, by this time, Washington had grown past {{the ring of}} forts that had protected it a century earlier, and city surface roads already connected the parks, albeit not in as linear a route as envisioned. The plan to link Fort Stanton Park with other fort parks via a grand drive was quietly dropped in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Last Clear Chance was {{distributed}} by Union Pacific in 1959, and was circulated widely in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed.</b> Met with warm reception from safety workers, {{the film was}} featured in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 that originally aired in 1993, and clips from the film {{were used in the}} 2004 film Panorama Ephemera.

By evening he had convinced a G30S battalion in Merdeka Square and those occupying the RRI building to surrender, without any bloodshed. Army loyalists under Suharto retook Halim Air Force Base early the following morning. By that time the G30S leadership had escaped, while Sukarno had withdrawn to his palace in Bogor. In <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> the Indonesian Army and general populace undertook a campaign of retribution, killing or capturing registered and suspected PKI members– including most of the G30S leadership.|$|E

5|$|The Seneca allowed {{very few}} {{travelers}} {{to pass through}} the area and kept non-native settlement to a minimum. The French and Indian War (1754–1763) led to the migration of many Native Americans westward to the Ohio River basin, and more departed after the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). The United States acquired the Last Purchase, including what is now Cherry Springs State Park, from the Iroquois in the second Treaty of Fort Stanwix in October 1784. In <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of Lamu in the Lamu Archipelago grew {{at the expense}} of Pate in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> the fort's construction. The Sultan used Lamu Fort as a base for defeating the Mazrui rebels in Mombasa, and for establishing control over the East African coast. He moved the capital of his sultanate to Zanzibar. With its strategic importance lost, Lamu soon declined in economic importance in comparison to Mombasa and Zanzibar.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Owumi was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder, and he would suffer from its effects in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed.</b> He sometimes has had anxiety attacks before games, struggled to sleep, and considered suicide. Owumi received an offer to play another season with El-Olympi. The contract, two times that from {{his first year in}} Egypt, would have been the biggest contract of his career and would have made him the best-paid player to ever play in the Middle East. Initially accepting the deal, he later decided against it because he wanted to take a break from his basketball career. Instead, he began working at a community center in his hometown in Atlanta for seven months, making $9.25 per hour.|$|E

5|$|Alaska senator Ernest Gruening {{remained}} a staunch backer {{of the project}} from its inception to its cancellation, {{and made it a}} major personal political priority. Gruening led a coalition of Alaska lawmakers that included most of the Alaska Legislature. In the 1962 Alaska state elections, every candidate elected to the state legislature was a supporter of the project. In <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> the Alaska Legislature voted several times to allocate state funding for the project. Politicians at the city level also got into the action, as the city of Anchorage and the Fairbanks Public Utilities Board each voted to contribute $10,000 to a pro-Rampart organization. Among the group's members was Ted Stevens, who was appointed in 1968 as one of Alaska's representatives to the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, Lajjun was {{replaced}} by Jenin as the administrative capital of the sanjak which now included the Sanjak of Ajlun. By the 19th century it was renamed Sanjak Jenin, although Ajlun was separated from it. Zahir al-Umar, who became the effective ruler of the Galilee {{for a short period}} {{during the second half of}} the 18th century, was reported to have used cannons against Lajjun in the course of his campaign between 1771-1773 to capture Nablus. It is possible that this attack led to the village's decline in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed.</b> By that time, Lajjun's influence was diminished by the increasing strength of Acre's political power and Nablus's economic muscle.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> the {{completion}} of the fort, numerous telegraph lines were laid between Fort Corcoran, War Department offices in Washington, and other forts in Northern Virginia. According to a July 1863 report on the operations of the military telegraphs in the Army of the Potomac, six telegraph lines ran between Fort Corcoran and Washington, five between Corcoran and Fort Ethan Allen, two between Corcoran and Alexandria, and one each to two observation points southwest of the fort. Throughout the remainder of the war, Fort Corcoran remained an important communications center for the entire Arlington Line system of defenses, eventually connecting to over 30miles of telegraph wire at the time of Robert E. Lee's surrender.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{following}} {{the end of}} hostilities in November 1918 the role of the AN in the former German colonies in New Guinea had become primarily one of civil administration, although it continued to provide a garrison for the next two and a half years. The military government continued until 1921 when Australia received a mandate from the League of Nations to govern the territory. Despite the AN having seen no further action {{following the}} initial seizure of the colony, in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> the climate and a range of tropical diseases, such as malaria, had resulted in dozens of fatalities before the deployment concluded. Although interrupted by Japanese occupation between 1942–45, Australian administration lasted until 1975 when Papua New Guinea gained its independence.|$|E
5|$|Opera, as {{a musical}} and {{theatrical}} genre, {{began to emerge}} during {{the early part of}} Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation.|$|E
5|$|The Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway {{served as}} a post road in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed.</b> At some point, {{the section of the}} highway between Palmyra and Marion, {{initially}} a corduroy road, was rebuilt as a plank road and tolled. The highway fell into disrepair over the years, leading travelers to conceive ways to avoid paying toll. The toll booths were eventually removed, and the road was later covered with dirt and converted into a stage road. By the 1920s, the state of New York had assumed ownership of the Canandaigua–Pultneyville highway. In the mid-1920s, it became part of NY72, a north–south highway extending from NY52 in Naples to the Lake Ontario shoreline in Pultneyville by way of the western side of Canandaigua Lake.|$|E
