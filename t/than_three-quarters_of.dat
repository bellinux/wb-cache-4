The average age for marriage for a male was 26.8 and 25.1 for a female. Americans are also likely to remarry after their first divorce. In 1990, 40% of all marriages were remarriages. All together one can conclude that while there is no prevalent average household arrangement, most Americans (the average Joe) will get married and divorced once with a considerable number of Americans remarrying at least once.|$|E

40|$|Endoscopic submucosal {{dissection}} (ESD) has {{the advantage}} over endoscopic mucosa resection, permitting removal of gastrointestinal neoplasms en bloc, but is associated with relatively high risk of complications. Indications for early gastric cancer (EGC) are expanded: mucosal cancer without ulcer findings irrespective of tumor size; mucosal cancer with ulcer findings </= 3 cm in diameter; and minute submucosal invasive cancer </= 3 cm in size. The indications for early esophageal cancer (EEC) are the tumors confined to the two-third layer of the lamina propria. The EEC lesions spreading more <b>than</b> <b>three-quarter</b> <b>of</b> circumference of the esophagus are at frequent risk of stenosis. The procedures include marking, submucosal injection, circumferential mucosal incision and exforiation of the lesion along the submucosal layer. Complete ESD can achieve a large one-piece resection, allowing precise histological assessment to prevent recurrence. Clinical outcomes of gastric and esophageal ESD have been promising, and the prognosis of EGC patients treated by ESD {{is likely to be}} excellent, though further longer follow-up studies are warranted. Notification of perforation risk is essential in particular for esophageal ESD. Bleeding during ESD can be managed with coagulation forceps, and postoperative bleeding may be reduced with routine use of the stronger acid suppressant, proton pump inhibitors...|$|R

40|$|Postmortem {{examination}} is {{a highly}} specialized surgical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a corpse to determine the cause and manner of death and to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and perception of postmortem examination among doctors and nurses in a tertiary health care of Sokoto state. A cross-sectional study design was used, {{and a total of}} 149 doctors and nurses participated in the study. Respondents were recruited into the study using probability proportionate to size followed by a simple random sampling method. Data were obtained through self-administered questionnaires, and the data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences Version 17. 0. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, and multinomial logistic regression analysis were carried out. The mean age of respondents was 31. 6 (5. 6) years. There were more nurses than doctors (60. 4 % vs. 39. 6 %) in the study. More <b>than</b> <b>three-quarter</b> (80 %) <b>of</b> the respondents had fair to good knowledge of postmortem examination.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{prevalence}} of intimate partner violence (IPV) of women (aged > 18 years) attending general practice and to assess the association between IPV and depression. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted within 15 general practices across Rotterdam. The study population was all women older than 18 years of age attending general practice. Women were screened for sociodemographic factors, IPV and depression using the Composite Abuse Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS: This study had {{a response rate of}} 63 % (221 of 352 women). Two hundred and fourteen women were included in the study of whom 41 % were migrants. Thirty per cent of the women attending general practise ever experienced IPV. Migrants experienced IPV 1. 5 times more often compared to Dutch women. A significant association between IPV and depression was found. Half of the abused women were suffering from a depression. More <b>than</b> <b>three-quarter</b> <b>of</b> depressed women ever experienced IPV. CONCLUSIONS: IPV is common in women attending general practice and it is significantly associated with depression.

40|$|Introduction: Childhood {{diseases}} like diarrhoea, respiratory infections, measles, etc are {{very common in}} India. It is known that a child may get affected several times in a year; the incidence increases with the aggravation {{of a state of}} malnutrition. Aim: The study was aimed to assess the malnutrition and morbidity profile in underfive children in urban slum area of Nagpur. Material &amp; Methods: A house-to-house survey was conducted. By systematic random sampling 434 children below five years of age were included in the study. Every attempt was made to cover maximum number of children by giving 3 visits to them. Total 404 children were covered in the study. The information obtained from childâ&# 8364;&# 8482;s mother was filled in the proforma. Every child was subjected to thorough clinical examination in daylight, and anthropometric measurements. Hemoglobin estimation was done by using Sahliâ&# 8364;&# 8482;s haemoglobinometer and peripheral smear was prepared. Data was analyzed on Epi-Info Software 3. 2 version. Chi square test is used to test the significance. Result: It was observed that highest prevalence of morbidity was of anaemia (78. 71 percent), most of them were nutritional: followed by protein energy malnutrition (IAP classification) was 52. 23 percent, vitamin B deficiency (46. 53 percent), disease of respiratory system 32. 19 percent).
