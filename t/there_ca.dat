50|$|It {{is unclear}} how many {{children}} Karijotas had. The number varies between 4 and 10. Reliable data is available about four: Aleksander, George, Konstantin, and Fedir, who helped Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, to defeat the Tatars in the Battle of Blue Waters in 1363. In return, they received Podolia. Aleksander (died ca. 1380) {{was involved in the}} Galicia-Volhynia Wars between his uncle Liubartas and Casimir III of Poland. In 1366 Aleksander received Volodymyr-Volynskyi from Casimir for his service against his uncle. Only four years later, after Casimir's death, Liubartas recaptured the city. George (died in 1375 in Moldavia) at first assisted Aleksander, but was poisoned soon after accepting an invitation to become the ruler of Moldavia. Kostantin, after the Union of Krewo in 1385, moved to Hungary and died <b>there</b> <b>ca.</b> 1389. Fedir (died in 1414) inherited Navahrudak from his father and after other brothers were dead ca. 1389, became ruler of all Podolia. In 1392 he disobeyed Vytautas the Great and had to run to Hungary, where he ruled Mukachevo and built Palanok Castle. Dmitri Bobrok is also frequently listed as one of Koriat's sons.|$|E
50|$|Medici {{typically}} {{paid the}} tombolari small sums for the looted and stolen goods, and then smuggled {{them out of}} Italy to Switzerland, where they were restored. Taking advantage of the lax attitudes and practices of 'cooperative' auction houses - notably Sotheby's in London - Medici built up an elaborate network of front companies and elite antiquities dealers and galleries, including the British dealer Robin Symes, Rome-based American dealer Robert E. Hecht, and Hollywood dealer and producer Bruce McNall. A major investigation by the TPC (the art crimes division of the Carabinieri) beginning in the 1990s, which eventually resulted in Medici's conviction, recovered {{tens of thousands of}} looted artefacts, and extensive documentary evidence, including thousands of sequential photographs that showed the journey of these looted objects from excavation, through restoration, to their final placement in museum collections, as well as a crucial handwritten 'organigram' (organisational chart) that named and linked all the members of Medici's operation. TPC investigations also revealed that Medici used front companies to anonymously sell and then buy back many items, often multiple times, in order to manipulate the market, as well as allowing him to acquire the all-important Sotheby's provenances. In February 2016, TPC officials announced that a raid on Robin Symes' warehouse in the Geneva Freeport had uncovered a huge collection of 17,000 looted antiquities, nearly all of which are thought to have been sourced from Medici, and which Symes secretly placed <b>there</b> <b>ca.</b> 2000 in order to conceal their existence from the executors of the estate of his former lover and business partner, Christo Michelaides, who died in 1999.|$|E

50|$|A faience manufactory at {{the village}} of Montereau-sur-le-Jard had been {{established}} by Jean Rognon, working <b>there</b> <b>ca</b> 1720-1740, but the manufacture of faïence fine, which requires a very white body under its colorless but glossy lead glaze, was begun in 1749, sited {{to the east of}} the village centre the quartier Saint-Nicolas. From 1755 to 1762 these kilns were operated by Etienne-François Mazois (1719-1762) who intended to rival the increasingly successful Queen's ware perfected by Josiah Wedgwood, that was driving the traditional tin-glazed earthenwares of France out of business. In 1760 Mazois was the entrepreneur of the royal manufacture at Nevers. His family maintained a shop for faience in quai de la Tournelle, Paris. After a lapse the manufacture of faïence fine at Montereau was resumed in 1774 by an English partnership, Clark, Shaw et Cie, succeeded by Hall and Merlin-Hall, who found a new rival, 1796 - 1805, in another English entrepreneur, Christopher Potter (1751-1817). Potter first introduced in France the English technique of transfer printing from copperplate engravings onto earthenware and porcelain. This innovation transformed the pottery of Montereau from an artisanal phase to a proto-industry. Between 1805 and 1815, to avoid conflicts with the pottery of Merlin-Hall at Montereau, Potter set up works in a former tile manufactory nearby, at Cannes-Ecluse. In 1819 the proprietor of the competing manufactory at Creil bought out the owners of the Montereau works at a stiff price. The potteries at Montereau were fully incorporated with the works at Creil from 1840 to 1895 as the Faïenceries de Creil et Montereau. then in 1920 were hived off in association with the faience manufactory at Choisy-le-Roi,. The manufacture at Montereau finally closed in 1955, the abandoned works destroyed and the archives lost.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{distortion of}} information by subordinates and several {{variables related to}} distortion. Methodology and results are presented for distortion of upward information leadership roles and accuracy in down-ward communication. The evidence strongly suggests that certain activities of the superior have an important bearing upon subordinate distortion of information. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF COMMUNICATION to the manage-ment of organizations is reflected in both the literature and the common sense of managers. Social organization without com-munication is impossible. One of the more widely-known writers in organization theory, Herbert A. Simon, reflects on the impor-tance of communication to social organization in the following: Communication may be formally defined as any process whereby decisional premises are transmitted from one member of an organiza-tion to another.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} labor market distortions present in {{transition}} and developing economies coupled with indivisibilities in consumption {{may help explain}} the resistance to globalization prevalent {{in many of these}} economies. We assume that workers differ in ability. In a market economy their earnings depend on their ability. However, earnings are independent of ability due to a common wage set in manufacturing in a transition economy and because of family farms in a developing economy. Trade can have significant adverse effects in this setting. When the economy is productive enough, a high income autarky equilibrium can be sustained in a distorted economy through a high income, high demand, high income virtuous circle. However, the distortion tends to make trade operate in a way that destroys this. Our work suggests that trade liberalization without structural reform can have serious adverse effects in transition and developing economies: <b>there</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} the coefficients {{of the leading}} poles of the complete two-loop quark self-energy Σ(p) in the Coulomb gauge. Working {{in the framework of}} split dimensional regularization, with complex regulating parameters σ and n/ 2 −σ for the energy and space components of the loop momentum, respectively, we find that split dimensional regularization leads to well-defined two-loop integrals, and that the overall coefficient of the leading pole term for Σ(p) is strictly local. Extensive tables showing the pole parts of one- and two-loop Coulomb integrals are given. We also comment on some general implications of split dimensional regularization, discussing in particular the limit σ → 1 / 2 Despite serious efforts during the past twenty years to place the Coulomb gauge on the same rigorous footing as covariant gauges, we still have no consistent rules for renormalizing non-Abelian theories in this gauge. <b>There</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractSperm-specific {{phospholipase}} C zeta (PLCζ) {{is known}} to induce intracellular Ca 2 + oscillations and egg activation when expressed in mouse eggs by injection of RNA encoding PLCζ. We investigated the expression level and spatial distribution of PLCζ in the egg in real time and {{in relation to the}} initiation and termination of Ca 2 + oscillations by monitoring fluorescence of a yellow fluorescent protein ‘Venus’ fused with PLCζ. Ca 2 + oscillations similar to those at fertilization were induced at 40 – 50 min after RNA injection, when expressed PLCζ reached 10 – 40 × 10 − 15 g in the egg. PLCζ–Venus increased up to 3 h and attained a steady level at 4 – 5 h. Interestingly, PLCζ–Venus is accumulated to the pronucleus (PN) formed at 5 – 6 h and continuously increased <b>there.</b> <b>Ca</b> 2 + oscillations stopped in most eggs before initiation of the accumulation. A variant of PLCζ that lacks three EF hand domains was much less effective in induction of Ca 2 + oscillations and little accumulated in the pronucleus, indicating a critical role of those domains. The ability of the accumulation to the pronucleus qualifies PLCζ for a strong candidate of the Ca 2 + oscillation-inducing sperm factor, which is introduced into the ooplasm upon sperm–egg fusion and concentrated to the pronucleus after inducing egg activation...|$|E
40|$|Occasionally tobacco {{producers}} {{will report}} cases of tobacco blooming shortly after transplanting. There are two separate situations that may cause tobacco to bloom {{prior to the}} normal time. The first is premature bloom where a tobacco plant will start to bloom at approximately 3 to 6 weeks after transplanting. The plant will develop abnormal leaves that are strappy in appearance and resemble sucker growth more than normal plant growth. The other situation is early bloom, where a plant produces normal leaves but blooms with a lower leaf number than normal and often earlier than expected. There are many theories why tobacco might be prone to bloom prematurely. One thought is that the plant {{is old enough to}} bloom. For example, if {{it has been in the}} float system for a long time, it may be time for it to bloom. This is an incorrect assessment of the situation. A county agent in Kentucky demonstrated this principle one year by starting some tobacco seeds in December as a trial run prior to the normal seedbed season. By May he had plants that were yellowed, woody and certainly old. He wondered what would happen if he set these plants alongside some that were of normal age and compared the response. At normal bloom stage he could not tell old plants from normal plants. When tobacco is transplanted, the clock is reset to some extent. However, <b>there</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E

40|$|The Pole-Equator-Pole (PEP) {{projects}} of the PANASH (Paleoclimates of the Northern and Southern Hemisphere) programme have significantly advanced {{our understanding of}} past climate change on a global basis and helped to integrate paleo-science across regions and research disciplines. PANASH science allows us to constrain predictions for future climate change and {{to contribute to the}} management and mitigation of such changes. We identify three broad areas where PEP science makes key contributions. 1. &nbsp;The patterns of global changes: Knowing the exact timing of glacial advances (synchronous or otherwise) during the last glaciation is critical to understanding inter-hemispheric links in climate. Work in PEPI demonstrated that the tropical Andes in South America was deglaciated earlier than the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and that an extended warming began <b>there</b> <b>ca.</b> &nbsp; 21 &nbsp; 000 cal years BP. The general pattern is consistent with Antarctica and has now been replicated from studies in Southern Hemisphere (SH) regions of the PEPII transect. That significant deglaciation of SH alpine systems and Antarctica led deglaciation of NH ice sheets may reflect either i) faster response times in alpine systems and Antarctica, ii) regional moisture patterns that influenced glacier mass balance, or iii) a SH temperature forcing that led changes in the NH. This highlights the limitations of current understanding and the need for further fundamental paleoclimate research. 2. &nbsp;Changes in modes of operation of oscillatory climate systems: Work across all the PEP transects has led to the recognition that the El Ni&# 241;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon has changed markedly through time. It now appears that ENSO operated during the last glacial termination and during the early Holocene, but that precipitation teleconnections even within the Pacific Basin were turned down, or off. In the modern ENSO phenomenon both inter-annual and seven year periodicities are present, with the inter-annual signal dominant. Paleo-data demonstrate that the relative importance of the two periodicities changes through time, with longer periodicities dominant in the early Holocene. 3. &nbsp;The recognition of climate modulation of oscillatory systems by abrupt climate events: We examine the relationship of ENSO to an abrupt SH climate event, the Antarctic cold reversal (ACR), in the New Zealand region. We demonstrate that the onset of the ACR was associated with the apparent switching on of an ENSO signal in New Zealand. We infer that this related to enhanced zonal SW winds with the amplification of the pressure fields allowing an existing but weak ENSO signal to manifest itself. Teleconnections of this nature would be difficult to predict for future abrupt change as boundary conditions cannot readily be specified. Paleo-data are critical to predicting the teleconnections of future abrupt changes...|$|E
