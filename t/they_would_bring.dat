5|$|Alan Grant, {{a writer}} from Scotland, {{got his start}} on 2000 AD as an {{assistant}} writer for John Wagner. Grant rose to prominence as an equal of Wagner's {{in the creation of}} Judge Dredd comic strips. These stories were noted favorably for their use of socio-political commentary and satire. Together, the duo acquired employment with DC Comics. Dennis O'Neil assigned them to Detective Comics in 1988, hoping <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> their gritty, violent take on Judge Dredd to Batman storylines. Soon after, Wagner left the company, leaving Grant to continue the run on his own. Drawing on his work for Judge Dredd, Grant began injecting social commentary into the comic book, and avoided using common Batman rogues in favor of his own creations. Some of these villains were influenced by characters from the Judge Dredd universe. Anarky was conceived singularly by Grant {{as a result of these}} circumstances, and Grant's own intellectual and philosophical meditations influenced the portrayal of the character over the following years.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 2005, the mobile-game {{publisher}} Gameloft {{announced that}} <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> Meteos and Q Entertainment's other puzzle game, Lumines, to cell phones. The game {{was released on}} March 30, 2006, as Meteos Astro Blocks. In 2006, Buena Vista Games announced they would publish four Q Entertainment games, including the then-unannounced Meteos: Disney Magic for the Nintendo DS. A sequel to Meteos, Meteos: Disney Magic, developed by Platinum Egg and Aspect Co., follows Meteos basic concept {{with a number of}} changes—most notably, replacing the game's alien species with Disney characters. The Nintendo DS was held sideways, creating a taller playing field on the touchscreen. Disney characters Mickey Mouse, Jack Sparrow, and Winnie the Pooh are featured in the game, whose plot involves restoring order in the storybook vault after its contents are mysteriously rearranged. A significant change in gameplay was the ability to drag tiles left and right; in Meteos, tiles could only be moved up and down. Meteos: Disney Magic was released in North America on February 22, 2007, and in Europe on June 1. It had a cooler reception than its predecessor, with a score of 74 out of 100 from Metacritic. Phil Theobald, who also reviewed the first Meteos, while enjoying Disney Magic, thought that the lowered difficulty made it less fun.|$|E
25|$|Monday 26 April was market day; {{there were}} more than 10,000 people in the former Basque capital. Generally speaking, a market day would have {{attracted}} people from the surrounding areas to Guernica to conduct business. Market days consisted of local farmers bringing in their crops to sell to the village people. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> the crops of the week’s labour to the main square, which is where the market was held.|$|E

25|$|In Santo Domingo, Zuazo {{wrote to}} Spanish King Charles I (Holy Roman Emperor Charles V) and William de Croÿ, Charles's chamberlain, to inform {{them of the}} hidden costs of slavery in the New World (January 22, 1518). At the same time, he {{recommended}} the importation of black slaves, even specifying {{the age at which}} they should be imported (15 to 20 years), and that they should marry. They were to replace Indigenous slaves, and he anticipated that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> in much gold.|$|E
25|$|Samuel: {{a wealthy}} Jewish merchant. He {{made a deal}} with some Gentiles that he would give Azriel's bones to them to do what he pleased if <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> his daughters to safety. Whether Azriel truly loved him in the end or not is a matter of debate, because the scene begins with Azriel begging Samuel to fly him away from the {{oncoming}} pogrom, but ends on a sad note with Azriel being forced back into the bones cursing his master for being a martyr. This begins Azriel's onslaught of all his subsequent masters.|$|E
25|$|In 10 March, the Finnish Reds {{proposed}} {{negotiations with}} the Germans over their potential threat against Turku, the Red capital of Southeast Finland. The Germans agreed to meet the Red delegation in Åland if <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> the POWs kept in Turku. In 1918 the Russians exchanged more than 65,000 wounded and invalid German POWs via Finland. The Red delegation including the socialist philosopher Georg Boldt and the Turku militia leader William Lundberg, together with 260 POWs, travelled across the ice by horse-drawn sleigh. In 15 March, Boldt and Lundberg {{had a meeting with}} the Germans. However, the Reds were told that since the Germans were invited by the Whites, they could not discuss their intentions. Boldt and Lundberg were then escorted back to the mainland.|$|E

25|$|By 24 May {{the town}} was {{completely}} cut off, and 2nd Lieutenant William Dothie, commanding a Troop of six S/L detachments east of the town, found himself out of communication with his Battery HQ. His THQ, including a number of stragglers from other units, came under attack by German tanks and aircraft {{in the evening and}} he fell back to a small farm in a nearby wood. The following morning, Dothie led an attack on the tanks in their camp, engaging them with Boys and Bren fire. Although the tanks withdrew, Dothie guessed that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> up reinforcements and he ordered his men to withdraw, covering their crossing of some open ground with a Bren gun. However, he and the QVR Bren gunner found themselves cut off {{on the wrong side of}} the open ground and could not get back to the rendezvous until after dark, by which time the rest of the party had made their way to Calais.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} {{governmental}} and human resource issues also exist. Employees in {{the tourism industry}} are often poorly trained and tourism operators also face high staff turnover. A {{lack of interest in}} tourism development also exists in many Nunavut governmental organisations {{as well as in the}} private sector, and a policy put in place to prevent [...] "market disruption" [...] by new businesses has led to many businesses being denied licences to operate due to the new competition <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> to the market. This policy has not only acted to the detriment of competition in the tourism sector but has also limited the opportunities for industry growth. Finally, a lack of in-depth and relevant statistics about trends and growth in tourism in Nunavut has prevented businesses from planning for their short- and long-term futures.|$|E
500|$|Eric Johnson {{auditioned for}} {{the roles of}} Lex and Clark, before finally being cast as Whitney Fordman. When the {{producers}} called him in for a third audition, Johnson informed them that if they wanted him then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> him in for a screen-test. After the screen-test, Johnson was cast and spent only one day filming his scenes for the pilot. The producers, along with Johnson, wanted to portray Whitney as {{more than just the}} [...] "stereotypical jock" [...] that he could have easily become, {{in an effort to make}} sure Lana did not look stupid for going out with him. Whitney was given multiple storylines in season one in an effort to get audiences to view the character in a more pleasant light, but Kristin Kreuk feels that it was all for naught, as the audience only sees him through Clark's eyes.|$|E
500|$|On the album's {{recording}} sessions, Smith noted [...] "there {{was a lot}} {{of drugs}} involved". The band took LSD and drank a lot of alcohol, and to save money, they slept in the office of their record label. The musicians usually turned up at eight, and left at midday looking [...] "fairly deranged". Smith related: [...] "We had an arrangement with the off-licence up the road, every night <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> in supplies. We decided we weren't going to throw anything out. We built this mountain of empties in the corner, a gigantic pile of debris in the corner. It just grew and grew". According to Tolhurst, [...] "we wanted to make the ultimate, intense album. I can't remember exactly why, but we did". The recording sessions commenced and concluded in three weeks. Smith noted, [...] "At the time, I lost every friend I had, everyone, without exception, because I was incredibly obnoxious, appalling, self-centered". He also noted that with the album, he [...] "channelled all the self-destructive elements of my personality into doing something".|$|E

500|$|Following the April 2005 {{release of}} Jean Brault's {{damaging}} testimony at the Gomery Commission, implicating the Liberals in the scandal, opinion polls placed the Conservatives ahead of Liberals. The Conservatives had earlier abstained from {{the vote on}} the 2005 budget to avoid forcing an election. With the collapse in Liberal support and a controversial NDP amendment to the budget, the party exerted significant pressure on Harper {{to bring down the}} government. In May, Harper announced that the government had lost the [...] "moral authority to govern". Shortly thereafter, the Conservatives and Bloc Québécois united to defeat the government on a vote that some considered to be either a confidence motion or else a motion requiring an immediate test of the confidence of the House. The Martin government did not accept this interpretation and argued that vote had been on a procedural motion, although they also indicated that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> forward their revised budget for a confidence vote the following week. Ultimately, the effort to bring down the Government failed following the decision of Conservative MP Belinda Stronach to cross the floor to the Liberal Party. The vote on the NDP amendment to the budget tied, and with the Speaker of the House voting to continue debate, the Liberals stayed in power. At the time, some considered the matter to be a constitutional crisis.|$|E
500|$|At the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show, Honda {{presented}} the EV-Cub concept vehicle, an electric motorcycle patterned after the venerable Super Cub, featuring two-wheel drive {{by means of}} electric motors mounted in the hubs {{of each of the}} wheels. Honda said they felt keeping the 1958 layout for their 21st century concept bike made sense because, [...] "the human body has not changed in the past 50 years," [...] and, [...] "the size, shape and position of all the Super Cub parts had a kind of necessity to them, and that the design of the Super Cub was very rational and rider-centric." [...] The additional space created by the absence of the engine {{in the center of the}} frame and the lack of a gas tank created room for underseat helmet storage, typical of a scooter. Integrated with the new electric motorcycle was an interactive communications system, to let riders converse while riding. Several other companies, including Christini, KTM, Öhlins, and Yamaha have done development on two-wheel drive motorcycles, and have found that the addition of power to the front as well as the rear wheel aids in stability, particularly in corners and in the hands of novice riders. At the time Honda hinted that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> the EV-Cub to market in 2010. In a 2016 speech, Honda's President and CEO Takahiro Hachigo said they planned to release the EV Cub in Japan in about two years, followed later in other ASEAN markets.|$|E
500|$|The hanging of Sam McKenzie {{and other}} citizen justice in early July 1884 {{prompted}} many thieves and rustlers {{to leave the}} territory. [...] However, a large band of horse thieves still operated in the Musselshell region. With the tacit approval of the stockgrower's associations, Granville Stuart organized a small intelligence network and mobilized forces {{to go after the}} thieves. The group included many of Stuart's ranch hands and stock detectives employed by various stock associations. [...] Known as [...] "Stuart's Stranglers", the vigilantes were responsible for the recovery of dozens of stolen horses and the deaths of at least 18 thieves in July 1884, by hanging, shootings or fire. [...] The last hanging occurred on August 1, 1884. In July 1884, Theodore Roosevelt who later became the 26th President of the United States, was operating a cattle ranch in Medora, North Dakota along the Little Missouri River in cooperation with cattle merchant Marquis de Mores. [...] His ranch was suffering from rustling as well. [...] Both Mores and Roosevelt offered their services to the Stranglers, but Stuart declined the offer to avoid the undue notoriety <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring.</b> [...] From that point forward, stock detectives, employed by the various stock associations, took responsibility for enforcing stock laws and deterring rustling. [...] Although there was minor public outrage about the killings, none of Stuart's Stranglers were ever brought to trial for their actions and editorials in regional newspapers praised their efforts. [...] General acclamation of Granville Stuart's actions was reflected by his election as the first president of the Montana Stockgrower's Association in late July 1884.|$|E

500|$|The Norwegian Airline Pilots Association {{recommended}} that its members not {{cooperate with the}} police in any way, stating that [...] "the police should sit passively {{and wait for the}} report from the commission". On 17 November the issue was brought to Parliament by the Liberal Party's Lars Sponheim, but Minister of Transport and Communications Kjell Opseth stated {{that he did not want}} to interfere. In January 1994, the police announced that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> six Widerøe pilots to court to force them to undergo police questioning. The six pilots were the two that piloted the previous shift on the aircraft, two that landed at Namsos Airport half an hour before the accident, and the two that had test-flown after the previous maintenance spell some days before the accident. In February, HSL started extensive investigations of the culture among pilots in Widerøe, and initiated interviews with dozens of pilots and managers in the company to investigate systematic failures in the company. Salten District Court ruled in April in favor of court questioning of the pilots. In May, the police brought the demands to receive the CVR in to Namdal District Court. A ruling was not made until December, which supported the police's demands. However, the issue was appealed by the accident board and the ministry. The issue was not resolved until August 1995, when Frostating Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and required the tape to be handed over to the police. After the tape was handed over, both the pilots in Widerøe and the accident board would not cooperate deciphering the contents, nor would they hand over transcripts or notes, and asked the police take the matter to the courts if they needed any further assistance.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{aside from}} the three men, Carey worked with Carole King, a female singer-songwriter who had been {{predominantly}} popular in the 1970s. However, unlike with C+C Music Factory, King approached Carey, hoping {{to work with her}} after hearing her perform live on The Arsenio Hall Show. During a conversation with Carey, King suggested that she cover [...] "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman," [...] a song she had written with Gerry Goffin for Aretha Franklin. After giving it some thought, Carey declined the offer, feeling uncomfortable about recording a song she felt one of her musical influences performed so perfectly. Still determined on working with Carey, King flew to New York for one day, to try to create a ballad of some sort. The two ladies sat together by a piano {{over the course of the}} day, and by nightfall, had written and arranged a song titled [...] "If It's Over." [...] After working with Carey, King said in an interview [...] "I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings." [...] After recording [...] "If It's Over," [...] Carey expressed the musical connection she shared with Afanasieff, as well as the creative format in which she wrote and produced her music when with him, or working with C+C Music Factory. When working with Afanasieff, the duo would sit by a piano, and lead each other vocally and musically, until they would reach the right note and arrangement. During an interview in 1992, Afanasieff described how Carey would stand next to him, and begin singing different notes and tunes she was thinking of, while he would follow her with the piano. In doing so, he would help lead her to the right note and vice versa. Carey described their working relationship as [...] "very unique," [...] and felt it to be very similar to the form in which she had worked with Margulies. While similar, Carey's creative process with Cole and Clivillés proved different; <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>bring</b> her several different tapes and tunes, of which she would choose from. Afterwards, they would work on building the already created melody, and have Carey add and build onto it, as well as writing the lyrics and key.|$|E
