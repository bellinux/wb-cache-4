40|$|The {{filamentous}} fungus Byssochlamys fulva strain IMI 40021 produces (+) -byssochlamic acid 1, its novel dihydroanalogue 2 and four related secondarymetabolites. Agnestadrides A, 17 and B, 18 constitute a novel class of seven-membered ring, maleic anhydride-containing (hence termed heptadride) natural products. The putative maleic anhydride precursor 5 for both nonadride and heptadride biosynthesis was isolated as a fermentation product {{for the first}} time and its structure confirmed by synthesis. Acid 5 undergoes facile decarboxylation to anhydride 6. The generic term maleidrides is proposed <b>to</b> <b>encompass</b> biosynthetically-related compounds <b>containing</b> maleic anhydride moieties fused to an alicyclic ring, varying in size and substituents...|$|R
30|$|It {{is first}} {{necessary}} to establish sources of best practice. For {{the purpose of}} this analysis treaties that have not been widely ratified, treaties that have been signed but are not yet in force as well as sources of soft law have been chosen to reflect elements of best practice with regards to the rights of seasonal workers. Treaties, conventions and regulations that are widely ratified often only constitute the lowest level of common interest that can be agreed upon and can thus be considered as ensuring a minimum standard of protection. In order to define best practice it seems to be more promising to turn to provisions that have not been widely ratified and elements of soft law, which are not legally binding. These provisions are more likely <b>to</b> <b>contain</b> <b>encompassing</b> social protection rights for workers that address their specific needs and should thus be considered as benchmark provisions.|$|R
40|$|We {{comment on}} {{mathematical}} results about the statistical behavior of Lorenz equations an its attractor, and more generally {{to the class}} of singular hyperbolic systems. The mathematical theory of such kind of systems {{turned out to be}} surprisingly difficult. It is remarkable that a rigorous proof of the existence of the Lorenz attractor was presented only around the year 2000 with a computer assisted proof together with an extension of the hyperbolic theory developed <b>to</b> <b>encompass</b> attractors robustly <b>containing</b> equilibria. We present some of the main results on the statisitcal behavior of such systems. We show that for attractors of three-dimensional flows, robust chaotic behavior is equivalent to the existence of certain hyperbolic structures, known as singular-hyperbolicity. These structures, in turn, are associated to the existence of physical measures: in low dimensions, robust chaotic behavior for flows ensures the existence of a physical measure. We then give more details on recent results on the dynamics of singular-hyperbolic (Lorenz-like) attractors. Comment: 40 pages; 10 figures; Keywords: sensitive dependence on initial conditions, physical measure, singular-hyperbolicity, expansiveness, robust attractor, robust chaotic flow, positive Lyapunov exponent, large deviations, hitting and recurrence times.

40|$|Face {{detection}} is {{an important}} contributing factor to make computer vision applicable to problems of everyday life. Of the techniques used for face detection, two are more efficacious i. e. skin detection and violajones based face detection. These two techniques have limitations of their own. One of the most restricting factors to these techniques is the color cluster of the image. Face detection algorithms are trained {{on a set of}} images. Those images are sure to be occupying a particular color cluster of the color plane because it is not possible for the set <b>to</b> <b>contain</b> <b>encompass</b> the full color space. If an image occupying a color space other than that on which the algorithms is trained is an input to the algorithm, the result is not optimal then. This paper explores the effect of different color clusters on the performance of both techniques. Images of color clusters other than that on which the algorithms are trained are given to the algorithms and the results are analyzed to decide the optimality of the techniques in face of images on which the algorithms are not trained. Key-words: Viola-jones, Face detection, Color cluster, Color spaces...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{paper by}} Perry et al. (2007, Defining biominerals and organominerals: Direct and {{indirect}} indicators of life, Sedimentary Geology, 201, 157 - 179) proposes to introduce “the new term ‘organomineral'” to describe mineral products whose formation is induced by by-products of biological activity, dead and decaying organisms, or nonbiological organic compounds, to {{be distinguished from}} the biomineral components of living organisms. The substantive ‘organomineral', however, is not new: it was first introduced in 1993, with basically the same definition and distinction from biominerals, at the 7 th International Symposium on Biomineralization (Défarge and Trichet, 1995, From biominerals to ‘organominerals': The example of the modern lacustrine calcareous stromatolites from Polynesian atolls, Bulletin de l'Institut Océanographique de Monaco, n° spéc. 14, vol. 2, pp. 265 - 271). Thereafter, more than twenty-five papers by various authors have been devoted to organominerals and organomineral formation (‘organomineralization') processes. Only two of these papers are cited by Perry et al., and without any reference to the definitions, or even the terms ‘organomineral' or ‘organomineralization', which they included. Moreover, Perry et al. tend to enlarge the original concept of organomineral <b>to</b> <b>encompass</b> all minerals <b>containing</b> organic matter, whether these organic compounds are active or passive in the mineralization, which introduces ambiguities detrimental to a fine understanding of present and past geobiological processes. Finally, Perry et al. propose to consider organominerals as indirect biosignatures {{that could be used}} in the search for evidence of life in the geological record and extraterrestrial bodies. This latter proposition also is problematical, in that organominerals may be formed in association with prebiotic or abiotic organic matter...|$|R
