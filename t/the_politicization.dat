25|$|<b>The</b> <b>politicization</b> of the {{education}} system essentially replaced academic tradition and excellence with ideological adherence and trappings, such as membership in National Socialist organizations, such as the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP, National Socialist German Workers Party), the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund (NSDDB, National Socialist German University Lecturers League), and the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund (NSDStB, National Socialist German Student League). <b>The</b> <b>politicization</b> can be illustrated with the conflict which evolved when a replacement for Arnold Sommerfeld was sought in view of his emeritus status. The conflict involved one of the prominent Uranverein participants, Werner Heisenberg.|$|E

25|$|None {{of these}} measures, however, {{were able to}} make the Commission as {{effective}} as desired, mainly {{because of the presence of}} human rights violators and <b>the</b> <b>politicization</b> of the body.

25|$|Reaction to U.S. {{involvement}} was mixed. It was well received by physicians and civilians at the scene.

Religious identities were part of the growing in-/ out-group mechanism utilized in C 4 te d'Ivoire in the 1990 s, while the political elites tried to politicize religion.

25|$|Politicization of the German academia {{under the}} National Socialist regime had driven many physicists, engineers, and mathematicians out of Germany {{as early as}} 1933. Those of Jewish {{heritage}} who did not leave were quickly purged from German institutions, further thinning the ranks of academia. <b>The</b> <b>politicization</b> of the universities, along with the demands for manpower by the German armed forces (many scientists and technical personnel were conscripted, despite possessing useful skills), substantially {{reduced the number of}} able German physicists.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>politicization</b> {{of science}} {{in the sense of}} a {{manipulation}} of science for political gains is a part of the political process. It is part of the controversies about intelligent design (compare the Wedge strategy) or Merchants of Doubt, scientists that are under suspicion to willingly obscure findings. e.g. about issues like tobacco smoke, ozone depletion, global warming or acid rain. However, e.g. in case of the Ozone depletion, global regulation based on the Montreal Protocol has been successful, in a climate of high uncertainty and against strong resistance while in case of Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol failed.|$|E

40|$|From a {{traditional}} field of philosophy ethics {{has become a}} crucial means of government. Fast-evolving sciences and technologies need a thorough ethical evaluation. However, ethics has been framed as a self-standing issue amenable to ‘scientific’ treatment, similarly to, and associated with, {{the assessment of the}} risk, safety and efficacy of innovation, in a concerted effort to contain <b>the</b> latter’s <b>politicization.</b> <b>The</b> chapter analyses the triangulation of science, ethics and economy. First, it clarifies why ethics cannot be a substitute for politics. Subsequently it shows how the institutionalization of ethics advisory bodies and of ethical review in the anticipatory assessment of research and innovation are inscribed in a neoliberal rationale, as characterized by depoliticization, staged participation and indirect regulation based on people’s self-disciplining. An effective governance of science and innovation has to address their political aspects, that is, their embroilment with choices that can never be fully inclusive and rationally justified...|$|R
25|$|Casualty {{rates were}} the most vivid sign of this disaster. Already, {{by the end of}} 1914, only five months into the war, around 390,000 Russian men had lost their lives and nearly 1,000,000 were injured. Far sooner than expected, barely trained {{recruits}} had to be called up for active duty, a process repeated throughout the war as staggering losses continued to mount. The officer class also saw remarkable changes, especially within the lower echelons, which were quickly filled with soldiers rising up through the ranks. These men, usually of peasant or working-class backgrounds, were to play a large role in <b>the</b> <b>politicization</b> of the troops in 1917.|$|E
25|$|He {{argues that}} the {{availability}} of federal research funds distorts “the natural market for scientific research” by inducing scientists to eschew pursuit of radical lines of potentially promising research that might not appeal to politicians and bureaucrats who hold influence over the allocation of grant monies. “Federal funding of medical research guarantees <b>the</b> <b>politicization</b> of decisions about what types of research for what diseases will be funded. Scarce tax resources are allocated according to who has the most effective lobby, {{rather than on the}} basis of need or even likely success. Federal funding also causes researchers to neglect potential treatments and cures that do not qualify for federal funds.” In his view, eliminating government sources of funds for medical research would probably improve the quality of research being performed.|$|E

500|$|Biographer John Watson {{notes that}} Innis's work was profoundly {{political}} while McLuhan's was not. He writes that [...] "the mechanization of knowledge, not the relative sensual bias of media, {{is the key}} to Innis's work. This also underlies <b>the</b> <b>politicization</b> of Innis's position vis-a-vis that of McLuhan." [...] Watson adds that Innis believed very different media could produce similar effects. [...] "For Innis, the yellow press of the United States and the Nazi loudspeaker had the same form of negative effect: they reduced men from thinking beings to mere automatons in a chain of command." [...] Watson argues that while McLuhan separated media according to their sensory bias, Innis examined a different set of interrelationships, the [...] "dialectic of power and knowledge" [...] in specific historical circumstances. For Watson, Innis's work is therefore more flexible and less deterministic than McLuhan's.|$|E
500|$|Political Animals and Animal Politics {{has three}} key aims, and, correspondingly, its {{chapters}} are split into three sections. These aims are {{the analysis of}} three key [...] "innovations" [...] that the editors identify in the book's introduction. The first {{of these is the}} move, in animal ethics, from thinking about personal change to thinking about the implementation of rules or norms of conduct at the societal level. The second of these is a possible rapprochement between animal ethics and ecologism (environmental ethics and green political theory). The third is the increased presence of animal protection laws for the benefit of nonhuman animals themselves. Aside from the introduction, the book features ten single-authored chapters, with three in Part I: <b>The</b> <b>Politicization</b> of the Animal Advocacy Discourse, three in Part II: The Rapprochement between Animal Ethics and Ecologism, and four in Part III: The Introduction of Laws and Institutions for the Benefit of Animals.|$|E
