It became a central plank of the prosecution's case that <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> made no such call, and that the only reason Bamber would have lied about it—indeed, {{the only way he could}} have known about the shootings when he alerted the police—was that he was the killer himself.|$|E

Despite the novel being a work of fiction, visitors flocked to the building thinking it was the actual location of Ramona's marriage. To be clear, the Union did not simply invent this story; a tourist had already scratched the name [...] "Alessandro" [...] (Ramona's husband in the novel) in one of the walls. The caretaker decided to capitalize on the attendant publicity and began selling off pieces of the house as souvenirs. Naturally, the building's condition began to deteriorate rapidly.|$|E

On 23 April 1430, the younger FitzAlan departed for France {{in the company of}} the Earl of Huntingdon. [...] There he soon {{made a name for himself}} as a soldier, under the command of the king's uncle, John, Duke of Bedford. In June he took part in the Siege of Compiègne, where Joan of Arc had recently been captured. Later, he raised the siege of Anglure with the help of the Burgundians. On 17 December 1431, he was present when Henry VI was crowned King of France in Paris, where he distinguished himself at the accompanying tournament. FitzAlan's military success led to several important appointments of command; in November 1431, he was made lieutenant of the Rouen garrison, and shortly after also captain of Vernon. [...] In January 1432 he was appointed captain of Verneuil. [...] On the night of 3 February he was taken by surprise while in bed at the Great Tower of Rouen Castle, when a band of French soldiers from nearby Ricarville managed to take the castle. [...] Arundel was hoisted down the walls in a basket; and made his escape. [...] The assailants could not hold the castle, because Marshall Boussac refused to garrison the town; Guillaume de Ricarville was forced to surrender twelve days later. In April 1432, FitzAlan was rewarded for his actions so far by initiation into the Order of the Garter.|$|E

A Baraita on the authority of Rabbi Joshua ben Karha compared this to a father who set up a bridal canopy for his son, and prepared a banquet with every sort of food. But then his son died. So the father broke up the canopy, saying that he had prepared it only for his son. Now that the son was dead, <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> no need for a banquet. Thus God created the animals only for the benefit of people. Now that people had sinned, God had no need for the animals.|$|E
2500|$|Like many third-century Christian scholars, Arius was {{influenced}} by the writings of Origen, widely regarded as the first great theologian of Christianity. However, while he drew support from Origen's theories on the Logos, the two did not agree on everything. [...] Arius clearly argued that the Logos had a beginning and that the Son, therefore, was not eternal, and that the Son is clearly subordinate to the Father, the Logos being the highest of the Created Order. This idea is summarized in the statement [...] "there {{was a time when the}} Son was not." [...] By way of contrast, Origen taught that the Son was subject to the Father, and some of Origen's writings seem to imply that the Son is subordinate and less than the Father in some ways. However, Origen believed the relation of the Son to <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> <b>had</b> no beginning, and that the Son was [...] "eternally generated".|$|E

At the end of his apprenticeship in 1807 Timothy took over his father's position.

Blackett set up a four-man working group including himself, William Hedley, the viewer; Timothy Hackworth, the new foreman smith and Jonathan Foster, a [...] "wright". The first step in 1808 was the relaying of the Wylam tramway with cast iron plates, until then a simple timber-way. In 1811, the four-man team began investigating the adhesive properties of smooth wheels using a manually operated carriage propelled by a maximum of four men, and in the same year a single-cylinder locomotive devised by one Waters, reportedly on the Trevithick model, was built and tried for a few months with erratic results.|$|E
