5|$|The Downing Street Declaration of 1993 allowed Sinn Féin, a {{political}} party associated with <b>the</b> <b>IRA,</b> to participate in all-party peace negotiations on condition that <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> called a ceasefire. <b>The</b> <b>IRA</b> called a ceasefire on 31 August 1994. John Major's government, dependent on Ulster Unionist Party votes, then began insisting that <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> must fully disarm before there could be any all-party negotiations. <b>The</b> <b>IRA</b> saw this as a demand for total surrender and believed the British were unwilling to hold negotiations. It ended its ceasefire on 9 February 1996 when it detonated a powerful truck bomb in Canary Wharf, {{one of the two}} financial districts of London. The blast killed two people and caused an estimated £150 million worth of damage. <b>The</b> <b>IRA</b> then planted five other devices in London within the space of 10weeks.|$|E
5|$|In September 1973 a shopping-bag {{bomb was}} detonated by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) at {{the offices of}} the Prudential Assurance Company on Oxford Street, {{injuring}} six people. A second bomb was detonated by <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> on the street by Selfridges in December 1974, injuring three people and causing £1.5 million worth of damage. Oxford Street was again targeted by <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> in August 1975; an undiscovered bomb that had been booby trapped exploded without any injuries. <b>The</b> <b>IRA</b> also detonated a bomb at the John Lewis department store on Oxford Street in December 1992 along with another in nearby Cavendish Square, injuring four.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> orchestrated a {{terrorist}} attack in the town centre. The only injuries sustained were minor ones but over £1 million in damage was caused.|$|E

5|$|The {{night after}} the Miami Showband massacre, gunmen opened fire on a minibus near Gilford. It had been {{travelling}} from Banbridge to Bleary with nine people on board; all were Catholics and most had been returning from a regular bingo session. One report says it was stopped at a fake British Army checkpoint. Five Catholic civilians were shot; passenger Joseph Toland was killed outright and driver James Marks died of his wounds in January 1976. The attack was blamed on loyalists and Lost Lives—an account of every death in the conflict—states that reliable loyalist sources have confirmed the UVF was responsible. However, police have blamed <b>the</b> <b>IRA.</b> The RUC suggested <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> had meant to attack a police minibus in revenge for the Miami killings, but had mistakenly attacked a civilian minibus instead. A report by the police's Historical Enquiries Team (HET) also suggests this. <b>The</b> <b>IRA</b> has denied responsibility.|$|E

Informers were one aspect of this shift, other factors cited include, [...] "the increasing sophistication of <b>the</b> <b>IRA's</b> enemies in Belfast and Derry," [...] and the electoral strategy of Sinn Féin, which meant that, [...] "In Belfast IRA operations had been scaled down." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{attack was}} part of the Provisional IRA's {{campaign}} since 1970 aimed at forcing the British government to withdraw from Northern Ireland. Although Manchester had been the target of IRA bombs before 1996, it had not been subjected to an attack on this scale. In February 1996, <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> had ended its seventeen-month ceasefire with a large truck bomb attack on London's Canary Wharf financial district, though the 3,300-pound bomb of Manchester was {{three times the size of}} Canary Wharf. The Manchester bombing was condemned by the British and Irish governments and U.S. President Bill Clinton. Five days after the blast, <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> issued a statement in which it claimed responsibility, but regretted causing injury to civilians.|$|E
5|$|The {{project began}} after it emerged {{that the three}} IRA members shot in Gibraltar {{were found to be}} unarmed and not in {{possession}} of a bomb. The series' editor, Roger Bolton, dispatched journalists to Gibraltar and Spain, where they interviewed several people who witnessed the shootings as well as Spanish police officers who had been involved in surveillance of <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> team. The journalists also filmed the funerals of <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> members in Belfast. Satisfied by the journalists' findings, Bolton sought a conclusion to the programme; as the British government refused to comment, Bolton recruited a leading human rights lawyer to give his opinion on the findings. The documentary was broadcast on 28 April 1988 (just under two months after the shootings), despite two attempts by Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe to have the Independent Broadcasting Authority postpone the broadcast. Using the eyewitness statements, the documentary questioned the government's version of events, and suggested that the three IRA members may have been unlawfully killed. Reporter Julian Manyon summed up the programme's findings: none of the witnesses interviewed for the programme heard the soldiers challenge the trio before opening fire, but variously believed they had seen <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> members shot in the back, with their hands up, or after falling to the ground. The final contributor was the lawyer recruited by Bolton, who suggested that a judicial inquiry was necessary to resolve the conflicts.|$|E
5|$|Following the Irish War of Independence the Irish Free State {{was set up}} as an {{independent}} British Dominion covering most of the island of Ireland. After a brief civil war between the pro-Free State forces {{and members of the}} Irish Republican Army (IRA) who wanted any independent nation to cover the entire island the status of the Irish Free State was confirmed, and <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> forced underground. <b>The</b> <b>IRA</b> had supporters in the United Kingdom, working openly as the Irish Self-Determination League (ISDL), and the Free State government shared the names of these supporters with the British authorities, who kept a close eye on them. Between February and March they provided information on individuals that they said were part of widespread plots against the Irish Free State being prepared on British soil. On 11 March 1923 the police in Britain arrested IRA sympathisers living in Britain including Art O'Brien, the head of the ISDL. Sources disagree on numbers, giving either approximately eighty or approximately 100. The arrested men were placed on special trains and sent to Liverpool, where they were transferred to Dublin via a Royal Navy destroyer. It later transpired that not only were many British citizens (Art O'Brien himself had been born in England), at least six had never even been to Ireland before.|$|E

When Savage, McCann and Farrell—known IRA members—travelled to Spain in preparation for the attack, they were tracked {{at the request of the}} British government. On the day of the shootings, Savage was seen parking a white Renault in the car park used as the assembly area for the parade; McCann and Farrell were seen crossing the border shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1994 Tony Hall, {{the head}} of the BBC's News and Current Affairs, argued that the {{restrictions}} did not allow viewers to make a proper judgment about those subject to the rules, as the subtle changes to their voices could not be heard. In particular he cited the example of the appearance of Gerry Adams on the BBC's On the Record in September 1993, in which he spoke about the prospect of peace in Northern Ireland. Hall said Adams was nervous and defensive throughout the interview as the presenter, Sheena McDonald, argued that peace could not be achieved while <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> continued its violent stance, but that viewers were unaware of these aspects of the discussion. He also said that some countries, such as India and Egypt, had quoted the restrictions to BBC journalists who complained about the over use of censorship by authorities in those countries. Additionally Hall argued that Sinn Féin and <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> had manipulated the ban by using it as an excuse to decline interviews.|$|E
5|$|Initially, this protest did not {{attract a}} great deal of attention, and even <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> {{regarded}} it as a side-issue compared to their armed campaign. It began to attract attention when Tomás Ó Fiaich, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, visited the prison and condemned the conditions there. In 1979, former MP Bernadette McAliskey stood in the election for the European Parliament on a platform of support for the protesting prisoners, and won 5.9% of the vote across Northern Ireland, even though Sinn Féin had called for a boycott of the election.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> Provisional <b>IRA</b> {{has carried}} out {{numerous}} bank and post office robberies across Ireland throughout its existence. An RUC estimate from 1982–83, puts the amount stolen in such raids by <b>the</b> Provisional <b>IRA</b> at around £700,000 (sterling). Also in the 1980s, <b>the</b> Provisional <b>IRA</b> {{were involved in}} the kidnapping and ransom of businessmen Gaelen Weston, Ben Dunne and Don Tidey. Activities such as these were linked to <b>the</b> <b>IRA's</b> fund-raising. Gardaí estimate that <b>the</b> Provisional <b>IRA</b> got up to £1.5 million from these activities. Activities include smuggling, sale of stolen items and contraband including cigarettes, red diesel, extortion, protection rackets, and money laundering. Most recently, <b>the</b> Provisional <b>IRA</b> have been blamed for carrying out the Northern Bank Robbery in December 2004, although no proof was ever forwarded and this crime remains unsolved.

5|$|Operation Banner {{ended at}} midnight on 31 July 2007 after about 38 years of {{continuous}} deployment, the longest in British Army history. According {{to an internal}} document released in 2007, the British Army had failed to defeat <b>the</b> <b>IRA</b> but {{made it impossible for}} them to win by violence. Operation Helvetic replaced Operation Banner in 2007, maintaining fewer service personnel in a more-benign environment. From 1971 to 1997, a total of 763 British military personnel were killed during the Troubles. About 300 deaths during the conflict were attributed to the British Army, including paramilitary troops and civilians.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>IRA</b> {{had sent}} telephoned {{warnings}} about 90 {{minutes before the}} bomb detonated.

40|$|Two offset IRAs are numerically modeled and analyzed.
