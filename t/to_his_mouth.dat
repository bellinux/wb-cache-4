5|$|Suddenly, Kabandha {{appeared}} before them. The demon blocked {{the path of}} the brothers, who tried to escape by taking a different route, but were finally caught by Kabandha. The demon grabbed Rama in his right arm and Lakshmana in his left. Finding themselves helpless in Kabandha's clutches, Lakshmana appeals to Rama to escape and find Sita, leaving him behind as a sacrifice to the demon. Rama consoled him. Kabandha declared that he was extremely hungry and asked them who they were who had come to sate his hunger. At this time, Lakshmana realized that the strength of the demon lay in his hands and suggested that they cut off the demon's hands. Annoyed by the brothers' conversation, Kabandha decided to eat them at once and drew them closer <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> The brothers drew their swords and quickly cut off the arms of the demon, who fell down with a mighty roar.|$|E
25|$|He had {{the most}} {{to do with the}} {{development}} of the pantomime character of Clown. Grimaldi used a substantial amount of colour <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> cheeks, and eyebrows over his painted white face. The most striking aspect of his make-up was the large red triangles. His image was followed closely for the next 50 years by most British clowns.|$|E
25|$|He secured {{his first}} trophy {{by winning the}} League Cup against Liverpool 3–2 (AET) in Cardiff. Towards {{the end of the}} match, Mourinho was escorted from the touchline after putting his finger <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> in the {{direction}} of Liverpool fans, as a response to taunts directed towards him whilst Liverpool were leading, before the equalising goal.|$|E

25|$|Three weeks later, on April 29, while {{parked in}} the grounds of a Stanton supermarket, Bonin and Butts lured a 19-year-old {{employee}} named Darin Kendrick into Bonin's van on the pretext of selling the youth drugs. Kendrick was driven to Butts' apartment, where he was overpowered and bound by both men. In addition to enduring sodomy and partial ligature strangulation, Kendrick was forced to drink hydrochloric acid by Bonin, causing caustic chemical burns <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> chin, stomach and chest. Butts then drove an ice pick into Kendrick's ear, causing a fatal wound to the youth's cervical spinal cord. His body was discarded behind a warehouse close to the Artesia Freeway, with the ice pick Butts had driven into his skull still protruding from his ear.|$|E
500|$|The stage {{antics of}} Santiago often contrasted with his {{generally}} quiet demeanor; he often experimented with his guitar and equipment during songs. Deal's husband, John Murphy, said that during performances of [...] "Vamos", which features guitar feedback throughout, Santiago used to [...] "whack {{the crap out}} of his amp", often picking up the amplifier and moving it around. During some solos, Santiago would often pull the guitar up <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and break guitar strings with his teeth.|$|E
500|$|The story {{takes place}} {{on the high seas}} in the Caribbean during the 17th century during a {{conflict}} among colonists. When a major event occurs, Mike hears the sound of a typewriter in the sky. Mike's reality literally changes each time the author makes a change to the story. Mike realizes that during times when he hears the audible sounds of the typewriter, his actions and words are not of his own volition, and when such sounds are absent he is able to make decisions for himself. Mike {{falls in love with a}} woman in the story, and grows frustrated after realizing that she is just another of Hackett's fictional creations. At the end of the work, Mike returns to New York, and is left with lingering doubts whether he is still a character in someone else's story. He muses whether a [...] "typewriter in the sky" [...] is creating the world. Mike looks up into the sky in search of this mystical device or its controller: [...] "Abruptly Mike de Wolfe stopped. His jaw slackened a trifle and his hand went up <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> to cover it. His eyes were fixed upon the fleecy clouds which scurried across the moon. Up there– God? In a dirty bathrobe?" ...|$|E

50|$|The demon Dantavakra is {{not able}} <b>to</b> open <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>to</b> release the Chakra; because if he open <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and loosen the Chakra, the {{rotating}} chakra will cut <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> So he keep on stand {{for a long time}} with tightly bitten Chakra by his big teeth. Though this inactive state/pose of demon is advantage to Lord Krishna to kill him easily, But Lord Krishna wished and make a trick-plan <b>to</b> open <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> Neither Lord Krishna wishes to Touch him nor <b>to</b> harm with <b>his</b> hand. Lord Krishna wishes that the demon killed only with his Chakra.|$|R
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to rebel from his father, Peter decides {{to reach for the}} freezer to take out some ice cream during dinner, much to the chagrin of Tom Tucker, who {{attempts}} to stop him. As Peter lifts a spoon of ice cream <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> he is warned by Tucker several times not to eat it. When he does, however, Tucker repeatedly spanks him, in reference to the 1979 drama feature Kramer vs. Kramer (even though the spanking does not occur in the movie). After author Gore Vidal appears at the radio station Brian had invited him to speak at, Vidal quickly leaves after he finds the show to be low-brow. This causes Brian to quit the show, noting that he has become [...] "worse of a sell-out" [...] than when Stewie appeared in a Butterfinger commercial. Stewie is then shown eating a Butterfinger, and says [...] "Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger", which is a parody of the many Butterfinger commercials featuring Bart Simpson, and utters the annoyed grunt, D'oh!, a phrase used regularly by The Simpsons character Homer Simpson. The bit is also a reference to the negative criticism and similarities between Family Guy and The Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|At the hospital, Treves {{examined}} Merrick, {{observing that}} he was [...] "shy, confused, not a little frightened, and evidently much cowed." [...] At this point, Treves assumed that the Elephant Man was an [...] "imbecile". He measured Merrick's head circumference at the large size of , his right wrist at [...] {{and one of his}} fingers at [...] in circumference. He noted that his skin was covered in papillomata (warty growths), the largest of which exuded an unpleasant smell. The subcutaneous tissue appeared to be weakened and caused a loosening of the skin, which in some areas hung away from the body. There were bone deformities in the right arm, both legs, and, most conspicuously, in the large skull. Despite the corrective surgery <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> in 1882, Merrick's speech remained barely intelligible. His left arm and hand were not large and were not deformed. His penis and scrotum were normal. Apart from his deformities and the lameness in his hip, Treves concluded that Merrick appeared to be in good general health. Norman later recalled that Merrick went to the hospital for examination [...] "two or three" [...] times and during one of their meetings, Treves gave Merrick his calling card. On one of the visits, Treves had photographs taken, and he provided Merrick with a set of copies which were later added to his autobiographical pamphlet. On 2 December, Treves presented Merrick {{at a meeting of the}} Pathological Society of London in Bloomsbury. Eventually, Merrick told Norman that he no longer wanted to be examined at the hospital. According to Norman, he said he was [...] "stripped naked and felt like an animal in a cattle market." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Elazar {{interpreted}} Joseph's {{reference to}} Benjamin in [...] {{to mean that}} just as Joseph bore no malice against his brother Benjamin (who had no part in selling Joseph to Egypt), so Joseph had no malice against his other brothers. And Rabbi Elazar interpreted Joseph's reference <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> in [...] to mean that Joseph's words reflected what was in his heart. A Midrash interpreted Joseph's reference <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> in [...] to mean that Joseph asked them to note that he spoke in Hebrew.|$|E

2500|$|In 1960, Jane Goodall {{observed}} a chimpanzee poking pieces of grass into a termite mound and then raising the grass <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> After he left, Goodall approached the mound and repeated the behaviour {{because she was}} unsure what the chimpanzee was doing. She found that the termites bit onto the grass with their jaws. The chimpanzee had been using the grass {{as a tool to}} [...] "fish" [...] or [...] "dip" [...] for termites.|$|E
2500|$|In Gombe National Park in 1960, Jane Goodall {{observed}} a chimpanzee, David Greybeard, poking pieces of grass into a termite mound and then raising the grass <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth.</b> After he left, Goodall approached the mound and repeated the behaviour {{because she was}} unsure what David was doing. She found that the termites bit onto the grass with their jaws. David had been using the grass {{as a tool to}} [...] "fish" [...] or [...] "dip" [...] for termites. Soon after this initial discovery of tool use, Goodall observed David and other chimpanzees picking up leafy twigs, stripping off the leaves, and using the stems to fish for insects. This modification of a leafy twig into a tool was a major discovery: previously, scientists thought that only humans made and used tools, and that this was what separated humans from other animals.|$|E

His battalion subordinate to the British 151 Infantry Brigade for the operation, Baker was unhappy with the lack of detail in the planning of the operation. On arriving at the starting line for his unit, he found Australian units in the wrong positions and convinced their commanding brigadier to move them. Within minutes of the commencement of the attack, he was wounded in the face. His wounds, <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> and tongue, were serious and he was repatriated to New Zealand where he would spend nearly a year in extensive rehabilitation. His exploits as commander of the 28th Battalion were recognised with an award of the Distinguished Service Order, which was gazetted in 1944.|$|E
