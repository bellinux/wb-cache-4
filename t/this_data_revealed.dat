5000|$|Additional {{observations}} by Galileo's Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) between 1996 and 2001 revealed Tupan to be a persistently active volcano, visible {{during most}} NIMS observations of Io's anti-Jupiter hemisphere. [...] Galileo acquired high-resolution color images and near-infrared spectra of Tupan Patera during an encounter on October 16, 2001. <b>This</b> <b>data</b> <b>revealed</b> warm, dark silicate lava {{on the eastern}} and western sides of the patera floor with an [...] "island" [...] of bright, cool material in the middle. [...] Reddish material was observed along {{the margins of the}} bright island {{as well as on the}} bright plains to the southeast of the volcano. This is indicative of short-chain sulfur being emitted from vents on the patera floor by recent volcanic activity. [...] The island as well as a shelf of material at the base of the patera wall is outlined by a [...] "strand" [...] of dark material. This strand line may result from lava filling the patera floor, then deflating due to either degassing of the cooling lava or drainage back into the magma chamber. Alternatively, the strand line may have been created from limited volcanic activity along the edge of the patera floor. The mix of red-orange and dark material on the volcano's western side possibly resulted from sulfur melting from the central island and the patera wall and covering the dark material in this area. [...] This theory is supported by the cooler temperatures seen on the western side of Tupan, cool enough perhaps to support the melting and solidification of sulfur, compared to the much darker eastern side. [...] The morphology of Tupan Patera may also be consistent with a sill that is still exhuming itself.|$|E

Here we show that the contribution of low-frequency antiferromagnetic fluctuations to the spin-lattice relaxation rate is also correlated with this non-Fermi-liquid term AT in the resistivity. These correlations suggest that anomalous scattering and pairing have a common origin, both rooted in the low-frequency antiferromagnetic fluctuations measured by NMR. A similar situation may also prevail in the recently-discovered iron-pnictide superconductors. Comment: ISCOM' 09 proceedings to be published in Physica...|$|E

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1976 The {{examination}} of hydrographic data obtained in Bristol Bay 1969 - 1970 allowed oceanographic conditions {{in this region}} to be described for shorter time periods (several weeks) than previous studies (several months). <b>This</b> <b>data</b> <b>revealed</b> that during early spring Bristol Bay was homogeneous both vertically and horizontally in temperature and vertically in salinity.
