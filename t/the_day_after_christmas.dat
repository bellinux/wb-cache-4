25|$|The ecclesial union {{engineered}} by Michael VIII was never popular in Byzantium, and, {{after his death}} (December 11, 1282), his son and successor, Andronicus II, repudiated it. On <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Christmas,</b> 1282, John Bekkos withdrew to a monastery; the former patriarch, Joseph I, was brought into the city on a stretcher, {{and a series of}} councils and public meetings ensued, led by a group of anti-unionist monks. Bekkos, in fear of violent death {{at the hands of a}} mob, was induced to sign a formal renunciation of his unionist opinions and of his priesthood (January, 1283), a renunciation which he afterwards disowned as extorted under duress, but which was used against him. After this, Bekkos spent some years under house arrest at a large monastery in Prusa in Asia Minor. From there, he began a literary campaign to exonerate himself, and succeeded in having a council called to reexamine his case; it took place at the imperial palace of Blachernae in Constantinople, meeting in several sessions from February to August in the year 1285. Although the Council of Blachernae reaffirmed Bekkos’s earlier condemnation, in the council’s aftermath Bekkos, by a series of writings, succeeded in bringing its dogmatic statement against him (the Tomus of 1285) into such disrepute that its principal author, the Patriarch Gregory II, resigned (1289). Bekkos saw this as vindicating his position. He spent the remaining years of his life in prison in the fortress of St. Gregory, revising his writings, maintaining friendly relations with the Emperor and prominent Byzantine churchmen, but unwilling to give up his unionist opinions; he died in 1297.|$|E

[...] The most perishable flowers are placed in small vials of water, which are placed onto the float individually.

50|$|As {{its name}} suggests, {{sporadic}} E is an abnormal event, {{not the usual}} condition, but can happen at almost any time; it does, however, display seasonal patterns. Sporadic E activity peaks predictably in the summertime in both hemispheres. In North America, the peak is most noticeable in mid-to-late June, trailing off through July and into August.

2500|$|Druids {{began to}} figure widely {{in popular culture}} with the first advent of Romanticism. Chateaubriand's novel Les Martyrs (1809) narrated the doomed love of a druid priestess and a Roman soldier; though Chateaubriand's theme was the triumph of Christianity over pagan druids, the setting was to {{continue}} to bear fruit. Opera provides a barometer of well-informed popular European culture in the early 19th century: in 1817 Giovanni Pacini brought druids to the stage in Trieste with an opera to a libretto by Felice Romani about a druid priestess, La Sacerdotessa d'Irminsul ("The Priestess of Irminsul"). The most famous druidic opera, Vincenzo Bellini's Norma was a fiasco at La Scala, when it premiered <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Christmas,</b> 1831; but in 1833 it was a hit in London. For its libretto, Felice Romani reused some of the pseudo-druidical background of La Sacerdotessa to provide colour to a standard theatrical conflict of love and duty. The story {{was similar to that}} of Medea, as it had recently been recast for a popular Parisian play by Alexandre Soumet: the chaste goddess (casta diva) addressed in Normas hit aria is the moon goddess, worshipped in the [...] "grove of the Irmin statue".|$|E

[...] Webster also recorded their Platoon Sergeant Floyd Talbert's view of Clancy as, [...] "a bright and eager younger brother who....would turn into a great soldier." [...] Introduced with Clancy was Mike Massaconi, who Clancy would call his closest buddy during the war. [...] In September 1944, Clancy jumped in the daring but doomed Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands. He {{was wounded in the}} leg in fighting there in October. [...] Clancy recovered from his wound and returned to his unit now located at Mourmelon, France. In December they were moved to the front in Belgium and fought in Bastogne, Belgium into January 1945.

However, the strategy was now seen as at risk. [...] Not only were his poll numbers in the early states falling — despite an attempt {{for a while to}} boost his standing in New Hampshire with $3 million of radio and television advertising, which ended up not having any effect — but he had lost his national lead and had fallen into statistical ties with Mike Huckabee. [...] Most dangerously, his lead in Florida, the first state that he planned to heavily contest, was dwindling as well. [...] Furthermore, changes in Giuliani's campaign messaging went largely unnoticed by the press, given that they were focused on Iowa and New Hampshire developments. [...] Giuliani's woes were further symbolized when he got sick with flu-like symptoms during a campaign flight and was admitted overnight to Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri as a precaution. [...] Giuliani resumed limited campaigning in subsequent days; the campaign would not give precise details of tests done; Giuliani then stated it had been a [...] "terrible headache", not flu, and a full medical report would be given after Christmas; but the health question had become an ongoing campaign story. [...] Giuliani did indeed get {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor on <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>Christmas,</b> but again a minor amount of political damage had been done.|$|E

Although Rosecrans had reported his army to have 81,729 effectives in Nashville, his force on the march was barely {{more than half of}} that since he needed to protect his base and supply lines from the harassment of the Confederate cavalry. The left wing of 14,500 men under Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden (divisions of Brig. Gens. Thomas J. Wood, John M. Palmer, and Horatio P. Van Cleve) took a route that was parallel to the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, passing through La Vergne and south of Smyrna. The right wing of 16,000 men under Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook (divisions of Brig. Gens. Jefferson C. Davis, Richard W. Johnson, and Philip H. Sheridan) marched south along the Nolensville Turnpike to Nolensville, south to Triune, and then eastward to Murfreesboro. The center wing of 13,500 men under Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas (divisions of Maj. Gen. Lovell H. Rousseau and Brig. Gens. James S. Negley, Speed S. Fry, and Robert B. Mitchell) moved south along the Wilson Turnpike and the Franklin Turnpike, parallel to the Nashville and Decatur Railroad, then eastward through Nolensville and along the same route used by Crittenden south of the Nashville and Chattanooga. Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. David S. Stanley (a single cavalry division under Col. John Kennett) preceded each of the three columns. The separation of the wings was designed to conduct a turning movement against Hardee at Triune, but when the U.S. march began, Bragg moved Hardee back to Murfreesboro to avoid a confrontation.|$|E

Rosa's story shows Scrooge being well-known to everybody in Duckburg and it could be said Donald and the nephews hoped (with little to no enthusiasm) their stingy uncle to remember them. One detail in Rosa's story that does not fit in Christmas on Bear Mountain is Scrooge's appearance. However, this error was intentionally made as Rosa wanted to maintain Scrooge's more well-known appearance.|$|R
