These lexicons require specialized post-editing tools and adapted exchange formats. First, we present a term-alignment validation tool that was specially designed for this kind of lexicons and that takes advantages of the linguistic information harvested during the extraction process.

40|$|This paper {{tries to}} comment {{on some of the}} {{standardisation}} efforts in the area of exchange formats for lexical resources. The first family of standards was centred around terminological data, producing exchange formats like MATER/ MARTIF and TBX, based on an organisation of the data as concepts and (language-specific) terms. When the exchange of fully annotated lexical data came into play, standards like OLIF and MILE were proposed; they focus on the representation and the exchange of (mono- and multilingual) dictionary entries and their attributes (Thurmair/Lieske 2002). Recent developments are organised around the creation of markup frameworks, try to define frameworks for meta-models on one hand, and sets of elementary data categories on the other hand, both of which can be grouped into workable exchange formats. 1 TBX 1. 1 History The first exchange format for terminology was called MATER; it defined how data had to be stored on a magnetic tape, specifying, among other things, byte sequence, tape length, block size etc. This format was converted into Micro-Mater (for PC exchange), and later into MAR-TIF, the first SGML-based format. Martif underwent several standardisation steps (ISO 12200, ISO 12620 and others) and was further developed in an EU funded project called SALT. The current status of the format is XLT (XMLbased Formats for Lexicon and Terminology Exchange) which is the framework for several flavours of the standard depending on the different LDV FORUM – Band 21 (1) – 2006 use cases; the most widely known format of these is TBX (<b>Term</b> <b>Base</b> <b>eXchange)</b> which is promote...|$|E
40|$|Cetaceans {{have most}} likely {{experienced}} metabolic shifts since evolutionarily diverging from their terrestrial ancestors, shifts {{that may be}} reflected in the proteins such as cytochrome b that are responsible for metabolic efficiency. However, accepted statistical methods for detecting molecular adaptation are largely biased against even moderately conservative proteins because the primary criterion involves a comparison of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates (dN/ dS); they do not allow for the possibility that adaptation may {{come in the form of}} very few amino acid changes. We apply the MM 01 model to the possible molecular adaptation of cytochrome b among cetaceans because it does not rely on a dN/dS ratio, instead evaluating positive selection in terms of the amino acid properties that comprise protein phenotypes that selection at the molecular level may act upon. We also apply the codon-degeneracy model (CDM), which focuses on evaluating overall patterns of nucleotide substitution in <b>terms</b> of <b>base</b> <b>exchange,</b> codon position, and synonymy to estimate the overall effect of selection. Using these relatively new models, we characterize the molecular adaptation that has occurred in the cetacean cytochrome b protein by comparing revealed amino acid replacement patterns to those found among artiodactyls, the modern terrestrial mammals found to be most closely related to cetaceans. Our findings suggest that several regions of the cetacean cytochrome b protein have experienced molecular adaptation. Also, these adaptations are spatially associated with domain structure, protein function, and the structure and function of the cytochrome bc 1 complex and its constituents. We also have found a general correlation between the results of the analytical software programs TreeSAAP (which implements the MM 01 model) and CDM (which implements the codon-degeneracy model) ...|$|R
40|$|Theory {{on state}} {{formation}} and subnational governance generally focuses on ordering—how rulers organize people and space to maximize control and extraction. Indeed, a new literature on “public authority” has recently {{contributed to the}} ways in which such order is produced. These theories rest on the assumption that the world is divided into “public” spaces, where the state directly extracts resources and enforces rules and bargains; and “private” spaces, out of reach of the state’s long arms. It is this stable and socially accepted division between “public” and “private” that allows for predictable <b>terms</b> of <b>exchange,</b> <b>based</b> on which citizens can maximize their returns under given constraints (for example, using forum shopping in response to limited institutional penetration or relevance of the state) and make claims on the state (for example, for the provision of services in exchange for taxation) ...|$|R

Currently, the industry mainly uses the standardized neutral files based methods to implement such exchange. While {{at the same}} time, the application of Web Ontology Language (OWL) file and underlying Semantic Web technologies in CAD model data exchange is gaining importance and popularity within the academia. The coexistence {{of different types of}} methods has generated a series of controversies and questions within the industry and the academia.

The apparent Km values for serine and ethanolamine in the microsomal fraction decreased with decreasing Cat+ concentration. Although no further increase of incorporation of serine and ethanolamine occurred after 40 min in the microsomal fraction, continuous incorporation of both bases into phospholipids was seen for 3 hr in excised retina.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study the {{relationship}} between lipid peroxidation, changes in the redox state of membrane and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) synthesis via <b>base</b> <b>exchange</b> reaction in rat liver microsomes was investigated. It was found that PE synthesis is enhanced {{in the presence of}} antioxidants, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), or unsaturated free fatty acids. Prooxidants, tert-butyl hydroxyperoxide (BHP), ferrous ions combined with ascorbate or NADPH (via cytochrome P 450 -dependent proteins), increased the amount of lipid peroxidation products in the membrane, and in consequence inhibited the reaction. The effect of BHP was fully reversed by reduced glutathione and dithiothreitol (DTT), whereas the effect of other compounds could be reversed only by BHT. In contrast, a reversal of the inhibitory effect of cadmium ions on <b>base</b> <b>exchange</b> activity was observed in the presence of DTT, but not BHT. Therefore, both the -SH/-S-S- ratio in the membrane, affected by BHP and cadmium ions, and the lipid hydroxyperoxides (rather than aldehydes), generated by ferrous ions and ascorbate or NADPH, are equally responsible for the inactivation of the ethanolamine <b>base</b> <b>exchange</b> enzyme in rat liver microsomes. This may suggest that the synthesis of PE via the <b>base</b> <b>exchange</b> reaction may be considered an element of the superfine cellular machinery involved in the repair of damage to unsaturated fatty acid chains of phospholipids caused by reactive oxygen species under oxidative stress...|$|R
40|$|Sirtuins are key {{regulators}} of many cellular functions including cell growth, apoptosis, metabolism, {{and genetic}} control of age-related diseases. Sirtuins are themselves regulated by their cofactor {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} (NAD+) {{as well as their}} reaction product nicotinamide (NAM), the physiological concentrations of which vary during the process of aging. Nicotinamide inhibits sirtuins through the so-called <b>base</b> <b>exchange</b> pathway, wherein rebinding of the reaction product to the enzyme accelerates the reverse reaction. We investigated the mechanism of nicotinamide inhibition of human SIRT 3, the major mitochondrial sirtuin deacetylase, in vitro and in silico using experimental kinetic analysis and Molecular Mechanics-Poisson Boltzmann/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-PB(GB) SA) binding affinity calculations with molecular dynamics sampling. Through experimental kinetic studies, we demonstrate that NAM inhibition of SIRT 3 involves apparent competition between the inhibitor and the enzyme cofactor NAD+, contrary to the traditional characterization of <b>base</b> <b>exchange</b> as noncompetitive inhibition. We report a model for <b>base</b> <b>exchange</b> inhibition that relates such kinetic properties to physicochemical properties, including the free energies of enzyme-ligand binding, and estimate the latter through the first reported computational binding affinity calculations for SIRT 3 :NAD+, SIRT 3 :NAM, and analogous complexes for Sir 2.

40|$|The bilayer {{distribution}} of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) in the endoplasmic reticulum of castor bean (Ricinus communis L. var Hale) endosperm following synthesis {{by both the}} CDP-ethanolamine: 1, 2 -diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase and ethanolamine <b>base</b> <b>exchange</b> reactions have been studied. Two chemical probes, 1 -fluoro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene (FDNB) and 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS), which covalently bind to the free amino groups, were utilized. The endoplasmic reticulum membranes were impermeable to TNBS at 4 and 25 °C, but were permeable to FDNB at both temperatures. FDNB treatment of the PtdEtn from the <b>base</b> <b>exchange</b> reacted with 92 % of the PtdEtn, while 80 % of the lipid reacted with TNBS. Thus, at least 80 % of the PtdEtn synthesized by the <b>base</b> <b>exchange</b> reaction was localized in the outer leaflet of the membrane, with about 12 % occurring on the inner leaflet and about 8 % being inaccessible. For PtdEtn formed by the CDP-ethanolamine pathway, 85 % reacted with FDNB and 70 % with TNBS, indicating that at least 70 % was produced to the cytoplasmic face of the ER and 15 % to the lumen side. The remainder was inaccessible to the probes. The sensitivity to trypsin of the two reactions also was tested. The ethanolamine <b>base</b> <b>exchange</b> enzyme, {{as well as that}} for l-serine exchange, retained activity following exposure to trypsin, but the activity of ethanolaminephosphotransferase disappeared after such treatment. This indicates that both <b>base</b> <b>exchange</b> enzymes are exposed to the lumenal side of the ER, while CDP-ethanolamine: 1, 2 -diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase is exposed on the outer or cytoplasmic side.
