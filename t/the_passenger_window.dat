Both a smartphone or tablet, and a vehicle may be leased. In many cities, vehicles used by Uber drivers must pass annual safety inspections and must have an Uber emblem posted in <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1971, the Cityliner was {{introduced}} to the public. This design had a passenger platform above the driver's cab, and included an onboard toilet. The vehicle also made use, of glass-fibre reinforced plastic for certain areas of the body, this was the first instance when this technique was used.

25|$|At 6:14am, as {{the police}} were taking details, {{they were told that}} a man had run into a red Peugeot further ahead on the same road. The driver saw Duggan move onto the road in front of him. The car swerved from the inside lane to the outside, but the driver said Duggan leapt in front of the car, arms raised and mouth open. The car hit him, denting the {{passenger}} door and shattering <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> and windscreen, and throwing Duggan into the path of a blue Golf, which ran over him.

50|$|Following a 1938 incident, the XC-12 was {{modified}} at Glendale, California: The forward slanting eight-piece windshield {{was modified}} to a four piece that slanted rearward, and <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>windows</b> were squared off {{to look more}} like a Douglas DC-3.|$|R
25|$|It {{is unclear}} how, but several Gulf Cartel members traced {{one of their}} stolen loads to a stash house of {{suspected}} dealers in Elsa, Texas on 1 November 2011. The cartel then called on an American-based prison gang to go and buy the loads to learn {{the location of the}} stash house. The gang dealers then went and bought the drugs from the dealers, but realized that it was not at the stash house were the goods were allegedly hidden. In an attempt to disclose the information to the dealers, the gang members kidnapped them, and that was when two country sheriffs received an emergency call a possible kidnapping. The policemen then spotted the gang member's Ford F-150 pickup truck and ordered the drivers to stop. While one of the policemen was speaking to the driver, the other approached <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> and was shot with a 9 mm gun. The policeman managed to survive because he was wearing a bullet vest. One of the gang members, however, was killed; the other {{was shot in the head}} and remained in critical condition.|$|E
2500|$|Gotti and Gravano {{arrived at}} the {{restaurant}} shortly before 5 o'clock and, after circling the block, parked their car across the intersection and within view of the entrance. Around 5:30, Gravano spotted Castellano's Lincoln Town Car stopped at a nearby intersection and, via walkie talkie, alerted the team of hitmen stationed outside the restaurant of Castellano's approach. Castellano's driver, Thomas Bilotti, pulled the car up {{directly in front of}} the entrance. As Castellano and Bilotti exited the Lincoln, the roughly half dozen shooters moved in and opened fire, killing both men in a barrage of bullets. As the hat-and-trench-coat-adorned men slipped away into the night, Gotti calmly drove the car past the front of the restaurant to get a look at the scene. Looking down at Bilotti's body from <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>window,</b> Gravano remarked, [...] "He's gone." ...|$|E
50|$|According to Jamal Razzak he was {{assaulted}} by Adnan & Abdul Darwiche {{and another man}} in Greenacre at 11:30am.

50|$|Set 2101 was {{the first}} 2100 series set to undergo refurbishment, in 2013. Modifications include {{replacing}} <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>windows</b> at <b>the</b> ends of each car with opening windows, replacing the curtains on these windows with roller blinds, and replacing the original fluorescent tube lighting with LED lighting, and installation of door chimes.|$|R
50|$|In late 2007, a minor {{update to}} the Saf-T-Liner C2 was made. To improve driver sightlines, the mirror bracket for the passenger-side {{rear-view}} mirrors was extended. <b>The</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>windows</b> were redesigned, with equal-sized window sashes (previously, {{the top half}} was larger). In the rear, the taillights were redesigned and enlarged, later becoming a standard design for all Thomas buses.|$|R

50|$|Midway Connection had two {{bird strike}} {{incidents}} involving geese. The first incident involved a goose striking the inner wing between {{the engine and}} the fuselage. During the incident the bird was also struck by the propeller and {{a portion of the}} carcass was thrown through <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> striking a passenger. The second involved a goose striking one of the landing gear sponsons causing substantial damage to the fairing and structure.|$|E
50|$|Prosecution {{testimony}} {{began with}} various witnesses detailing {{the night of}} the murder and the murder weapon used. Bakley was shot twice while sitting on the passenger side of the parked car and <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> was rolled down, indicating that she may have been familiar with her assailant. The murder weapon was revealed to be a semi-automatic Walther P-38 pistol, which was found in a dumpster a few yards away from the parked car where the shooting took place.|$|E
2500|$|On October 13, 2009, {{the airline}} {{unveiled}} a modification to its livery in {{commemoration of the}} upcoming 10th anniversary of the airline in February 2010. Besides a new tail design, the revised livery includes larger [...] "billboard" [...] titles extending down over <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>windows</b> at <b>the</b> front of the aircraft. The logo word 'jetBlue' {{will no longer be}} silver and blue but now a dark, navy blue.|$|R
5000|$|Blue and Red tail, {{with the}} {{lettering}} RAA in white. Blue fuselage with red cheatlines, {{and the name}} [...] "Reeve Aleutian" [...] over <b>the</b> middle <b>passenger</b> <b>windows,</b> in white.|$|R

50|$|Before being {{assigned}} to Ottawa in 1981, Altıkat {{had been an}} officer in the Turkish Air Force. He was married and had two teenage children. Altıkat was killed on his way to work at around 9:00 a.m. on August 27, 1982. When his car stopped for a red light on the Sir John A. Macdonald Parkway at Island Park Drive, a car stopped nearby, a passenger got out and fired nine shots from a 9mm Browning handgun through <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> of the car, killing the diplomat instantly.|$|E
5000|$|During the No Bull 5 races, the No Bull 5 {{eligible}} drivers raced {{with special}} paint jobs. The {{number on the}} roof and the rear spoiler was painted day-glow orange because many cars were painted red, and a day-glow [...] "$" [...] was affixed to <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> along with a red dot on the windshield in races prior to 2001. Other special decals were sometimes present. This allowed fans to quickly identify and follow the progress of the five eligible drivers. The only exception was the 1998 Daytona 500 where eligible drivers had silver numbers instead of the orange.|$|E
5000|$|The livery of the leased {{aircraft}} was never painted {{in a full}} scheme. The aircraft has a dark blue tail like that on the original Hamburg International livery. In {{the middle of the}} tail was a dark yellow map of Kosovo. The fuselage was white and towards the cockpit had to Hamburg International logo. Underneath <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>windows</b> towards <b>the</b> cockpit side of the {{aircraft was}} written [...] "Operated in cooperation with Kosova Airlines".|$|R
5|$|The 757-200M, a {{convertible}} version {{capable of carrying}} cargo and passengers on its main deck, entered service with Royal Nepal Airlines in 1988. Also known as the 757-200 Combi, the type retains <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>windows</b> and cabin doors of the 757-200, while adding a forward port-side cargo door {{in the manner of}} the 757-200PF. Kathmandu-based Royal Nepal Airlines, later renamed Nepal Airlines, included the convertible model as part of an order for two 757s in 1986.|$|R
5000|$|Twelve {{cylinder}} variants {{are easily}} {{identified by the}} [...] "V12" [...] emblems {{at the base of}} each C pillar, placed immediately behind <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>windows.</b> An entry level model, the CL420, was available with a 4.2 L V8 engine (with the same architecture as the M119 5.0 L V8 engine) and since it was not available at all markets, it had very low sales compared to its larger-engined siblings. Production ended September 1998 with 26.022 Coupés produced.|$|R

50|$|An award-nominated {{music video}} {{directed}} by Peter Christopherson {{was made to}} accompany the single. This features no musical performance, other than Cantrell's singing. It begins with a middle-aged man driving a 1972 Dodge Challenger down a Southwestern highway only to find Cantrell standing alone. The man picks up Cantrell, who remains laid back with one foot out <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> while turning the car's radio dial. They stop at a truck flipped {{on the side of}} the road, and the concerned driver hurries over to the vehicle for inspection. Cantrell, remaining seated, then takes the wheel and drives off with the man's car as the song's explosive chorus begins. He intentionally drives toward a semi-truck head-on before swerving away and stopping at a gas station.|$|E

50|$|Saab {{designers}} later {{experimented with}} evolving the styling feature into {{what has been}} referred to as reverse hockey stick, where the angle of <b>the</b> rear <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> extends out toward the rear end instead of curving forward towards the B-pillar.|$|R
50|$|The {{hockey stick}} is an {{automotive}} design feature seen on nearly all Saab automobiles. It is a C-pillar curve {{from the base}} of <b>the</b> rear <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> that resembles <b>the</b> shape of an ice hockey stick or the Nike swoosh symbol.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with its}} role in aerodynamics, the larger {{windshield}} {{played a role in}} safety by minimizing blind spots. Due to the slope of the windshield, Thomas moved the entry door further back, adding a large window ahead of the main entry door to improve visibility around the loading zone (similar to the Thomas Vista and nearly all small school buses). Along with a taller body, <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>windows</b> were enlarged compared to other Thomas buses. Additionally, the C2 has larger emergency exits compared to the FS-65 and the Thomas Saf-T-Liner Type D buses.|$|R
5000|$|Mary then {{drives to}} Utah, {{where she has}} been hired as a church organist. At one point, she can get nothing on her car radio but strange organ music. She passes a large, {{abandoned}} pavilion sitting all by itself {{on the shores of}} the Great Salt Lake; it seems to beckon to her in the twilight. Shortly thereafter, while she is speeding along a deserted stretch of road, a ghoulish, pasty-faced figure (never identified, but called [...] "The Man" [...] in dialogue and played by director Herk Harvey, uncredited) replaces her reflection in <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>window</b> and stares at her. When The Man suddenly appears in front of her, she swerves off the road. At a gas station, the attendant tells her the pavilion was first a bathhouse, then a dance hall, and finally a carnival before shutting down.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the night}} of January 6, 1933 in Dallas, the three {{stumbled}} into a trap set for another criminal and Barrow killed Tarrant County Deputy Malcolm Davis, shooting him point-blank in the chest with a 16-gauge shotgun. Jones and Parker were waiting {{in the car for}} Barrow and were as startled as the neighbors were when gunfire broke out. Jones [...] "grabbed a gun and began blasting the landscape." [...] Parker shouted to him to stop, that he might hit someone, and she circled the car around the block to catch up with Barrow. Though in his confession to police, Jones said that he was starting the motor while Parker fired her pistol out <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>window,</b> thirty-five years later, he told Playboy magazine, [...] "As far as I know, Bonnie never packed a gun.... during the five big gun battles I was with them, she never fired a gun." [...] In October 1934 Jones was tried and convicted as an accessory to Deputy Davis's murder as part of an arrangement with Dallas County Sheriff R.A."Smoot" [...] Schmid.|$|E

5000|$|... ===Livery=== From its 1988 {{formation}} to 2003, UPS Airlines used a bi-color {{brown and}} white livery on its aircraft. Most of the fuselage was painted white with the vertical stabilizer painted the same Pullman Brown as its delivery vehicles. On the {{centerline of the}} fuselage, a brown cheatline was applied; as its 727, DC-8, MD-11, and 747 fleet were converted passenger aircraft, this was done to further cover up <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>windows.</b> On <b>the</b> forward third of the fuselage above the cheatline was painted: [...] "United Parcel Service".|$|R
