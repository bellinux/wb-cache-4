A {{great number}} of large fabric samples were impregnated by padding with commercial finishing agents and then irradiated in air with a high power, semi-industrial UV source.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the acoustic wave propagation in bubbly liquid inside a pilot sonochemical reactor {{which aims to}} produce antibacterial medical <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> by <b>coating</b> the <b>textile</b> with ZnO or CuO nanoparticles. Computational models on acoustic propagation are developed in order to aid the design procedures. The acoustic pressure wave propagation in the sonoreactor is simulated by solving the Helmholtz equation using a meshless numerical method. The paper implements both the state-of-the-art linear model and a nonlinear wave propagation model recently introduced by Louisnard (2012), and presents a novel iterative solution procedure for the nonlinear propagation model which can be implemented using any numerical method and/or programming tool. Comparative results regarding both the linear and the nonlinear wave propagation are shown. Effects of bubble size distribution and bubble volume fraction on the acoustic wave propagation are discussed in detail. The simulations demonstrate that the nonlinear model successfully captures the realistic spatial distribution of the cavitation zones and the associated acoustic pressure amplitudes...|$|R
40|$|Superhydrophobic <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> are {{prepared}} by a simple, one-step gas phase coating procedure {{by which a}} layer of polymethylsilsesquioxane nanofilaments is grown onto the individual textile fibers. A total of 11 <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> made from natural and man made fibers are successfully coated and their superhydrophobic properties evaluated by the water shedding angle technique. A thorough investigation of the commercially relevant poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabric reveals an unparalleled long-term water resistance and stability of the superhydrophobic effect. Because of the special surface geometry generated by the nanoscopic, fibrous coating on the microscopic, fibrous <b>textiles,</b> the <b>coated</b> <b>fabric</b> remains completely dry even after two months of full immersion in water and stays superhydrophobic even after continuous rubbing with a skin simulating friction partner under significant load. Furthermore, important textile parameters such as tensile strength, color, and haptics are unaffected by the silicone nanofilament coating.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{acoustic}} wave propagation in bubbly liquids {{as part of}} the SONO project supported by the FP 7 European Commission programme, which is aimed at developing a pilot sonochemical plant in order to produce antibacterial medical <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> by <b>coating</b> of the textile with ZnO or CuO nanoparticles. The findings of this research are anticipated to aid the design procedures and also to provide better understanding of the micro scale physical and chemical events. Propagation of acoustic pressure waves in a bubbly liquid is modelled by using Helmholtz equation in this thesis. Computational models are developed based on meshless approaches, i. e. radial basis integral equation (RBIE) and local boundary integral equation (LBIE) methods. A major part of the research focuses on improving the efficiency and the accuracy of the developed methods. For this purpose, numerical tests are carried out with several example problems in order to cross-verify the applicability of the methods. As a result of these tests, the optimal parameters which should be used to minimize the numerical error are suggested. Further, strategies are proposed in order to handle the thin inclusions, such as <b>textile</b> <b>fabric,</b> in the domain. The wave propagation in bubbly liquids involves coupled effects of the sound field and bubble population field, such as dissipation of the acoustic energy by bubble oscillations. The problem is therefore non-homogeneous due to presence of bubbles and nonlinear due to coupled effects. The governing equations, derived from linearized or nonlinear theories, {{can be found in the}} literature. Examples of both linear and nonlinear wave propagation are solved in this study. Results related to a 3 D sonoreactor including <b>textile</b> <b>fabric</b> are also presented.

Handle is influenced by mechanical properties of <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> and the surface roughness. The KES-F system is standard objectified method among different measurement methods. But the measurement of surface roughness applied the KES-F which is contact method disturbs an accurate measurement for analysis of tactile perception. Hence we measure the surface roughness of <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> without deformation by a non-contact method applied the laser displacement sensor with a resolution of 1 µm and a accuracy of 0. 01 % and high precisely controlled linear motor for translated at constant speed. Since the <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> are woven and knitted with various colored yarn and its surface treated with chemical treatment to make luster, we analyze the effect of color and luster {{in order to reduce the}} optical errors. And the results of surface roughness of various <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> compared with the surface characteristic values (MIU, MMD) measured by KES-F system.

The proposed defect detection scheme consists of one real-valued optimal Gabor filter and one smoothing filter. The performance of the scheme is evaluated by using an offline test database with 78 homogeneous fabric images. The test results exhibit accurate defect detection with low false alarm, thus showing the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme. The performance of the proposed scheme is further evaluated by conducting real time tests using a prototyped automated defect detection system.

In {{all areas of}} materials science, integrating new abilities into common materials belongs to the most important topics in research and development.

The integration of electronic components, however, still suffers from incompatibilities between soft, flexible, bendable <b>textile</b> <b>fabrics</b> and rigid electronic parts. Connecting conductive yarns with electronic components, such as SMD-LEDs etc., cannot be performed by soldering nor by sewing. The typical connection technologies of both areas fail in these cases. A new possibility to achieve such electrical {{and at the same time}} mechanical connections is given by 3 D printing.
