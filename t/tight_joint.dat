40|$|Future {{aerospace}} vehicles must withstand {{high temperatures}} {{and be able}} to function over a wide temperature range. New composite materials are being developed for use in designing high-temperature lightweight structures. Due to the difference between coefficients of thermal expansion for the new composite materials and conventional high-temperature metallic fasteners, innovative joining techniques are needed to produce <b>tight</b> <b>joints</b> at all temperatures without excessive thermal stresses. A thermal-stress-free fastening technique is presented {{that can be used to}} provide structurally <b>tight</b> <b>joints</b> at all temperatures even when the fastener and joined materials have different coefficients of thermal expansion. The derivation of thermal-stress-free fasteners and joint shapes is presented for a wide variety of fastener materials and materials being joined together. Approximations to the thermal-stress-free shapes that result in joints with low-thermal-stresses and that simplify the fastener/joint shape are discussed. The low-thermal-stress fastener concept is verified by thermal and shear tests in joints using oxide-dispersion-strengthened alloy fasteners in carbon-carbon material. The test results show no evidence of thermal stress damage for temperatures up to 2000 F and the resulting joints carried shear loads at room temperature typical of those for conventional joints...|$|R

Brazing using active-metal-free filler alloy as insert between the joint components is an attempt to overcome it. The active metal diffusion from the titanium member through the bulk of molten filler to the ceramic was responsible to produce an active filler alloy in loco and promote reduction of the zirconium oxide to improve wetting on the ceramic surface. Unalloyed titanium was joined in a high-vacuum furnace (< 3 x 10 - 5 mbar) to yttria-tetragonal zirconia polycristals (Y-TZP) and zirconia partially stabilized with magnesia (Mg-PSZ), where commercial fillers Ag- 28 Cu and Au- 18 Ni with respective thermal cycles were evaluated. Helium gas leak detection test was performed at the ceramic/metal interface at room temperature; samples from reliable vacuum <b>tight</b> <b>joints</b> were examined by microstructural analysis techniques and energy dispersive X-ray analysis at the <b>joint</b> cross-section. <b>Tight</b> <b>joints</b> were produced with eutectic Ag-Cu filler, revealing an intermetallic layer and a dark reaction layer near the ceramic surface; titanium diffusion was efficient for superficial chemical interactions between individual components.

50|$|Shape-memory {{coupling}} is {{a system}} for connecting pipes using shape-memory alloys. In its typical form the technique uses an internally ribbed sleeve of alloy such as Tinel that is slightly smaller in diameter than the pipes it is to connect. The sleeve is cooled in liquid nitrogen then, in this low-temperature state, mechanically expanded with a mandrel to fit easily over the two pipe ends to be joined. After fitting, it is allowed to rewarm, when the memory effect causes the sleeve to shrink back to its original smaller size, creating a <b>tight</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|E
50|$|Due to this feature, {{blind rivets}} are used mainly when {{access to the}} joint is {{available}} from only one side. The rivet is placed in a drilled hole and is set by pulling the mandrel head into the rivet body, expanding the rivet body and causing it to flare against the reverse side. As {{the head of the}} mandrel reaches the face of the blind side material, the pulling force is resisted, and at a predetermined force, the mandrel snaps at its break point, also called blind setting. A <b>tight</b> <b>joint</b> formed by the rivet body remains, the head of the mandrel remains encapsulated at the blind side, although variations of this are available, and the mandrel stem is ejected.|$|E

5000|$|Green {{woodworking}} {{is a form}} of wood craft or {{in broad}} terms, carpentry, that works unseasoned or [...] "green" [...] timber into finished items. Unseasoned wood is wood that has been freshly felled or preserved by storing it in a water-filled trough or pond to maintain its naturally high moisture content. Green wood is much softer than seasoned timber and is therefore much easier to shape with hand tools. As moisture leaves the unseasoned wood, shrinkage occurs and the green woodworker can use this shrinkage to ensure <b>tight</b> <b>joints</b> in their work. To enhance the effect of the shrinkage, one half of a joint may be forcibly over-dried in a simple kiln while its encapsulating component is left green. The components tighten against each other as the parts exchange moisture and approach equilibrium with the surrounding environment. The swelling of the dry tenon inside the shrinking “green” mortise makes for an incredibly <b>tight</b> and permanent <b>joint</b> despite a lack of adhesives. Bodging is a traditional green woodworking occupation, where chair components were made in the woods and exported to workshops where the complete chairs were assembled by furniture makers (called cabinetmakers in the UK). Green woodworking has seen a recent revival due to its increased media coverage and the renaissance of hand tool woodworking in general.|$|R

The accuracy of our results is a marked improvement on previous work owing to three important differences in our analysis; we correctly account for cosmic variance errors by including a non-Gaussian contribution estimated from numerical simulations; we correct the measured shear for a calibration bias as estimated from simulated data; we model the redshift distribution, n(z), of each survey from the largest deep photometric redshift catalogue currently available from the CFHTLS-Deep. This catalogue is randomly sampled to reproduce the magnitude distribution of each survey with the resulting survey dependent n(z) parametrised using two different models. While our results are consistent for the n(z) models tested, we find that our cosmological parameter constraints depend weakly (at the 5 % level) on the inclusion or exclusion of galaxies with low confidence photometric redshift estimates (z> 1. 5). These high redshift galaxies are relatively few in number but contribute a significant weak lensing signal.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionThis {{retrospective}} series {{evaluated the}} surgical treatment of hip arthritis in children by needle aspiration-irrigation alone. Patients and methodsForty-three cases of septic hip arthritis were treated by needle aspiration-irrigation under general anesthesia associated with intravenous then oral administration of antibiotics. Clinical and biological criteria at admission, during hospitalization and at final follow-up were studied {{to identify any}} criteria carrying a predictive value for unsuccessful needle aspiration-irrigation. ResultsThirty-eight hips had a favorable outcome in this series, while secondary open arthrotomy was required in five hips for further irrigation. Common criteria found in the group requiring open arthrotomy were a diagnosis delay of at least 6 days between initial clinical symptoms and treatment as well as markedly abnormal biological results at admission. A threshold for the predictive value of certain variables was identified including C-reactive protein above 100, white polynuclear blood count above 15000, and sedimentation rate above 25 in the first hour and 50 in the second hour. DiscussionTreatment modalities for septic arthritis of the hip remain controversial in children and various techniques {{have been shown to}} be effective in the literature. Needle aspiration-drainage, the least invasive of these, has been shown to have good results, even in the hip, even though this is a deep, <b>tight,</b> <b>joint</b> which is known to be difficult to drain. Prognostic criteria are difficult to identify, however all authors agree that delayed treatment makes evacuation of intra-articular debris especially difficult. ConclusionNeedle aspiration-irrigation is effective in septic arthritis of the hip, as long as basic principles are followed. Delayed treatment and certain biological criteria should be taken into account when selecting a treatment, since negative predictive criteria identified in this series were present in the five hips requiring secondary arthrotomy.

40|$|AkzoNobel leaches {{rock salt}} in the Main Röt Evaporite member of the Hengelo brine field for {{maintaining}} the salt production and possible future usage of salt caverns for gasoil storage. Recent pressure tests on salt caverns selected for gasoil storage showed that hydrological connections could be formed between salt caverns. Fluid loss through created fluid pathways deteriorates {{the efficiency of the}} solution mining and makes storage opportunities more limited and more challenging. It is assumed that hydrological connections have been formed in the Solling Formation just below the Main Röt Evaporite member. The main goal {{of this study is to}} find out how these hydrological connections could have been formed. Moreover, the economic consequences of preventing hydrological connections in future salt caverns, by leaving a rock salt layer untouched in the lowest part of the Main Röt Evaporite member, will be investigated. Rock cores from the upper part of the Solling Formation, collected from locations in and surrounding the Hengelo brine field, showed a lithology consisting of fine sand-, silt-, and claystones, with a few thin anhydritic rock layers. Furthermore, gamma-ray patterns from wells in the upper part of the Solling Formation were very similar. A thin section of siltstone showed that interstitial pore spaces were tightly filled with halite cement. The rock volume in a fine sandstone sample had a rock salt volume of 35 percent. Some rock cores from the upper part of the Solling Formation contained small joints and fractures, with lengths up to a few decimetres. These fractures had apertures of a few millimetres, and larger fracture voids had widths up to a few centimetres. These apertures and fracture voids were tightly filled with halite or gypsum. Average rock permeabilities in fluid pathways between salt caverns, calculated from fluid inflow data into neighbouring salt caverns during pressure tests, varied mostly in the range of 0 and 1000 millidarcy. In comparison, the argon permeability of untreated silt- to fine sandstone sample was just 8. 06 E- 4 millidarcy. Also, a similar sample without halite cement had a water permeability of just 3. 46 millidarcy. Another similar sample with a <b>tight</b> <b>joint</b> showed a gradual permeability increase from 40 to 120 millidarcy within 7 hours. The cash flow model showed that rock salt layer A, in the 1 meter thick untouched rock salt layer case, needs at least a thickness of 35 meters to make preventing hydrological connections profitable. It was concluded that in the Hengelo brine field the upper part of the Solling Formation is uniform in composition, with “playa and mud flat” sedimentary facies. The tightly halite cemented interstitial pore spaces could be explained by hyperfiltration during Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, a period of decreasing burial depth. Fractures most probably played a role in accelerating the leaching process in the Solling Formation during the formation of fluid pathways. The sump phase is the most probable period in which these hydrological connections have been formed...|$|E
