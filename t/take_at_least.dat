5|$|In mid-September 2008, after {{protracted}} negotiations {{overseen by}} the leaders of South Africa and Mozambique, Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed a power-sharing deal which would see Mugabe retain control over the army. Donor nations have adopted a 'wait-and-see' attitude, wanting to see real change being brought about by this merger before committing themselves to funding rebuilding efforts, which are estimated to <b>take</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five years.

5|$|Less than a {{month after}} this victory, Adolf Hitler issued a {{directive}} stating that Germany must be ready for an offensive through France and the Low Countries. However, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German high command; OKW) was convinced that preparations would <b>take</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> until the following year. After furious arguments, Hitler reluctantly agreed to wait. In May 1940, three massive German army groups overran France and the Low Countries in little more than six weeks.|$|E
5|$|A {{committee}} {{appointed by}} the Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, and chaired by Keith Murray, recommended in 1957 that a medical school be established at Kensington. Its creation, followed by that of a Faculty of Arts, prompted the university to change {{its name to the}} University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 1958. Baxter established a number of unusual schools. He created a School of Nuclear Engineering in anticipation that a nuclear power industry would be established in Australia. He also created schools of Textile Technology, Wool Technology, Food Technology and Highway Engineering and Traffic Engineering. The School of Business Administration and an Institute of Administration was established in 1960, and ultimately the Australian Graduate School of Management in 1969. When the Faculty of Arts was created, he insisted that all Arts students <b>take</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one science subject.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, Banksia caleyi {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.caleyi belongs to the reseeder group. In the wild, seedlings <b>take</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> three to four years to reach flowering after bushfire. Non-patchy fires occurring at intervals of less than seven years may wipe out local populations of reseeders.|$|E
5|$|On March6, 2012, {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} {{announced that it}} was going forward with an all-electronic tolling plan. Such a plan will <b>take</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> five years to implement to allow time for equipment to be installed and the reconfiguration of ramps. It will save the turnpike commission $65 million a year on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. The plans call for a 76% surcharge for motorists who do not have E-ZPass that are billed by mail. This surcharge could raise the toll for someone without E-ZPass to $53.10 to travel the entire turnpike. In October 2016, the turnpike began accepting credit cards as payment at all cash toll booths. In April 2018, the turnpike commission will implement all-electronic tolling at the Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian, who was 51 at the time, said {{he planned}} to <b>take</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a year off from {{coaching}} before considering a run at a job in the professional ranks. Rumors circulated throughout 1975 that he might return to Notre Dame, but both he and Devine denied them. He finally decided that December that he would not coach in 1976 despite reportedly being pursued by the New York Jets of the NFL, but would instead host a television show beginning the following fall. His last coaching appearance was with the college players in the annual Chicago College All-Star Game against the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers on July 23, 1976 at Chicago's Soldier Field. The game was halted in the second half when a torrential thunderstorm broke out. Fans rushed onto the field, and play was never resumed. It was the last such game ever played.|$|E

5|$|Then-president Carlos Roberto Flores {{estimated}} that Mitch reversed 50years {{of progress in}} the country. Officials estimated it would <b>take</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 15years to rebuild completely. The national gross domestic product (GDP) only grew {{at a rate of}} 3% due to the storm, compared with 5.1% in 1997, due to damaged infrastructure and lingering effects. In 1999, the economy of Honduras contracted by 1.9%, largely due to the storm. The Honduran government increased spending by 24.7%,. much of it emergency funds to restore communications and provide relief, which caused economic deficits. This caused inflation to increase from 13.6% to 15.7%. The Honduran government adjusted its economic plan, including privatization of various federal entities. For two years, the government temporarily halted taxes to businesses affected by the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} at left offensive tackle from 1970 to 1972, and missing only one game in that span, Key {{was moved to}} left guard for the 1973 season. He played in 12 games in 1973, missing two due to injury, and all 14 games in 1974, despite suffering hand and thumb injuries {{in a game against}} the Washington Redskins. During the 1975 season, he suffered a knee injury during mini-camp in May that required surgery, a dislocated toe in {{the first game of the}} season against the New York Giants that was thought to <b>take</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> six weeks to recover from, and a fractured forearm in practice on October 16 that also required surgery. He was placed on injured reserve due to the broken arm on October 17 after playing in only two games during the season. From 1976 to 1978, he played in 40 games and started in 39 of them.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{hypothesized}} fire and/or nuclear winter effects, the impact would have inhibited photosynthesis {{by creating a}} dust cloud that blocked sunlight {{for up to a}} year. Further, the asteroid struck a region of sulfur-rich carbonate rock, much of which was vaporized, thereby injecting sulfuric acid aerosols into the stratosphere, which might have reduced sunlight reaching the Earth's surface by more than 50%, and would have caused rain and ocean water to become acidic. The acidification of the oceans would kill many organisms that build shells from calcium carbonate. At Brazos section, the paleo-sea surface temperature dropped as much as 7℃ for decades after the impact. It would <b>take</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> ten years for such aerosols to dissipate, and would account for the extinction of plants and phytoplankton, and of organisms dependent on them (including predatory animals as well as herbivores). Some creatures whose food chains were based on detritus would have a reasonable chance of survival, however.|$|E

5|$|British Vice-Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney {{had been}} warned that de Grasse was {{planning}} to <b>take</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> part of his fleet north. Although he had some clues that he might take his whole fleet (he {{was aware of the}} number of pilots de Grasse had requested, for example), he assumed that de Grasse would not leave the French convoy at Cap-Français, and that part of his fleet would escort it to France. So Rodney accordingly divided his fleet, sending Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood north with 15 ships of the line and orders to find de Grasse's destination in North America and report to New York. Rodney, who was ill, took the rest of the fleet back to Britain in order to recover, refit his fleet, and to avoid the Atlantic hurricane season. Hood sailed from Antigua on 10 August, five days after de Grasse. During the voyage, one of his ships became separated and was captured by a privateer.|$|E
5|$|By January 1947 the Army {{no longer}} needed a ship with Crusaders capabilities, and she was loaned to the Australian Shipping Board. In February that year she transported a load of earth moving {{equipment}} from Melbourne to Launceston, and carried a cargo of timber back to Melbourne. She continued to be manned by an Army crew and made several further trips between Tasmania and the mainland, but in April 1947 {{it was reported that}} the ship was to be scrapped on the grounds that she was considered unseaworthy. Gil Duthie, the Federal member for Wilmot, sought to have Crusader retained in service until the shortage of shipping capable of transporting heavy loads to and from Tasmania was rectified. The Shipping Control Board rejected Duthrie's representations on the grounds that Crusader would need extensive alterations before she could be permanently used for commercial trade, and it would <b>take</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> a year to complete the necessary works. However, the Board gave a commitment to make other ships available to transport timber from Tasmania. Crusader was subsequently offered for sale, and was purchased by the Queensland Cement and Lime Company (QCL). She arrived at Brisbane on 28 September 1947 and was subsequently renamed Cementco.|$|E
