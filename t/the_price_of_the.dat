5|$|According to French Senate's Comité des Prix de Revient des {{fabrications}} d'Armement (CPRA) {{cited by}} the daily La Tribune, {{the total cost of}} the AASM program including development costs and the delivery of 2348 kits is €846m. On that basis the per-weapon cost is $300,000 or twelve times the cost of the comparable American JDAM, although the latter has been manufactured in much larger quantities (~250,000 kits) and would be reasonable to expect a drastic reduction of <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French munition if larger contracts are signed and economies of scale are achieved.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the mass}} protests that {{occurred}} {{at that time}} were the winter 1981 general strike in Bielsko-Biała, the nationwide warning strike {{in the spring of}} that year and hunger demonstrations in summer. The warning strike took place {{in the aftermath of the}} Bydgoszcz events (March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned general strike was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but the negotiators worked under a threat of Soviet intervention. Wałęsa's compromise prevented a confrontation with the regime or its foreign allies, at <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protest movement's loss of some of its dynamics. During the months that followed Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.|$|E

5|$|Bojić's matrilineal line traces {{its origins}} {{to the town}} of Tetovo, in what is now {{northern}} Macedonia. His mother's family had fled the town in 1690 as part of the Great Serb Migration and settled in Bečkerek (modern Zrenjanin). Bojić's maternal grandfather, Jovan, had lived in the border town of Pančevo since he was a child, married and started a family there. Much like Bojić's father, he was a successful shoemaker, and in 1890 he offered to marry his only daughter to him. After initial disagreement over <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dowry, Bogojević gave the marriage his blessing and Bojić's parents were soon married.|$|E
5|$|By May 1786, Raspe {{no longer}} had control over the book, which {{was taken over by}} a {{different}} publisher, G. Kearsley. Kearsley, intending the book for a higher-class audience than the original editions had been, commissioned extensive additions and revisions from other hands, including new stories, twelve new engravings, and much rewriting of Raspe's prose. This third edition was sold at two shillings, twice <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original, as Gulliver Revived, or the Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages, and Adventures of Baron Munikhouson, commonly pronounced Munchausen.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, Ace's output was {{approaching}} one hundred titles a year, still heavily {{dominated by the}} primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of Frank Herbert's Dune, were priced at 95 cents. With Ballantine Books, Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.|$|E

K-III went public, however instead of cashing out, KKR {{continued to make}} new investments in the company in 1998, 2000 and 2001 to support acquisition activity. In 2005, Primedia redeemed KKR's preferred stock in the company but KKR was estimated to have lost {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars on its common stock holdings as <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's stock collapsed.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, a {{researcher}} in Devon discovered {{a list of}} ingredients for a pasty tucked inside an audit book and dated 1510, calculating the cost of making a venison pasty. This replaced the previous oldest recipe, dated 1746, held by the Cornwall Records Office in Truro, Cornwall. The dish {{at the time was}} cooked with venison, in this case from the Mount Edgcumbe estate, as the pasty was then considered a luxury meal. Alongside the ledger, which included <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pasty in Plymouth, Devon, in 1509, the discovery sparked a controversy between the neighbouring counties of Devon and Cornwall as to the origin of the dish. However, the term pasty appears in much earlier written records {{from other parts of the}} country, as mentioned above.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{the capitol}} wings closed for a {{restoration}} project to upgrade {{items such as}} furniture, plumbing, and electrical systems. The $34 million project became {{an issue in the}} 2008 Senate campaign between Gordon Smith and Jeff Merkley when Smith used <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project in ads attacking Merkley who was the Speaker of the Oregon House when the remodel was approved. Part of the attack involved the cost of new desks for legislators and staff that were manufactured by Oregon prison inmates. Renovations were completed in November 2008.|$|E

5|$|The first dish {{known to}} have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, a number of West African peoples had traditions of {{seasoned}} fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. Prior to the Second World War, fried chicken was often very expensive and was only enjoyed on special occasions. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, however, fried chicken has been mass-produced and <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dish has gone down significantly.|$|E
