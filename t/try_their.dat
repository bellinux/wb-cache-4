5|$|In {{the early}} days of sound cinema, among the various {{distinguished}} composers ready to <b>try</b> <b>their</b> hand at film music, Prokofiev was not an obvious choice for the commission. Based in Paris for almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance, characteristics at odds with the cultural norms of the Soviet Union. By early 1933, however, Prokofiev was anxious to return to his homeland, and saw the film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style.|$|E

They are brought before the Prince of the Sun, flanked by Chiquito and Huascar, the mysterious man Tintin encountered in Jauga. Zorrino is saved from harm when Tintin gives him Huascar's medallion, but Tintin and Haddock are sentenced to death by the Inca prince for their sacrilegious intrusion. The prince tells them they may choose the hour that Pachacamac, the Sun god, will set alight the pyre on which they will be executed.|$|E

25|$|The AFL's {{free agents}} came from several sources. Some were players {{who could not}} find success playing in the NFL, while another source was the Canadian Football League.

25|$|The data {{communications}} products Bynet distributed in Israel {{in the later}} half of the 1970s were all manufactured abroad. Though today Israel hosts more companies traded on NASDAQ {{than any other country}} apart from the United States and China, at that juncture in its history, Israel’s exports were disproportionately agricultural. The country had no home-grown, export-oriented hi-tech telecommunications industry. Undeterred by the fact that no venture capital was then available in the country, the Zisapel brothers decided to <b>try</b> <b>their</b> luck by establishing an export-oriented company in Israel to manufacture the types of devices that Bynet had been distributing.|$|E

25|$|Woodland's origins trace back to 1850 when California gained its {{statehood}} and Yolo County was established. Since {{the town}} started growing in population and resources, {{it has not}} stopped. The area was well irrigated due {{to the efforts of}} James Moore, and this drew people out to <b>try</b> <b>their</b> hand at farming. The endeavor was successful as people found the soil in the area very fertile. The city gained a federal post office and the next year the county seat was moved from Washington (present day West Sacramento, California) to Woodland after Washington was flooded. The addition of a railroad line, the close proximity to Sacramento, and the more recent addition of Interstate 5, helped create a thriving city.|$|E

Model docks indicated the scale and type of infrastructure required for the movement of cargo, whilst a mock crane provided a visual link to the second floor, which expanded on trade and cargo using a warehouse theme.

25|$|The filly {{was never}} entered {{for any of}} the British Classic Races but proved herself the best of her {{generation}} by beating the winners of both The Derby and The Oaks in the space of three days at Newmarket in October 1831. In the following year she won the Ascot Gold Cup, the year's most important weight-for-age race in a run-off after being held to a dead heat by the St Leger winner Rowton. From the summer of 1832, few owners were willing to <b>try</b> <b>their</b> horses against her and she won several prizes by walkover or forfeit. She was retired from racing after sustaining an injury in the spring of 1834. She made little impact as a broodmare and died in 1841.|$|E
25|$|While at Greenville, Thompson met Elizabeth Mahon, {{a talented}} {{player with the}} same passion for baseball, with whom she started a close friendship. Eventually, Thompson played in Greenville {{on the same team}} with Mahon.

25|$|The {{following}} day, Chen narrowly won {{the election}} with a margin of less than 30,000 votes out of 12.9million votes counted. Both of his referendum proposals were rejected due to insufficient turnout, {{in part by the}} Pan-Blue boycott. Those that did vote for the referendum overwhelmingly favored it. Due to the activation of the so-called National Security Mechanism which prevented military officers from voting, and island-wide reports of election fraud, Pan-Blue candidate Lien Chan refused to concede and sued both for a recount and for a nullification of the outcome while supporters held a week-long protest led by the Pan-Blues front of the presidential office in Taipei. He also claimed that the shooting was staged by Chen to win sympathy votes. Chen claimed that the shooting could not have been staged, because it would be too dangerous to have himself shot in a moving jeep and also challenged Lien and vice-presidential candidate James Soong to <b>try</b> <b>their</b> luck with a shooter in a stationary jeep. This challenge was {{based on the assumption that}} his belly wound was inflicted while he was in the moving jeep and not before or afterwards.|$|E
