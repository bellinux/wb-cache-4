2500|$|McCartney {{was living}} in Jane Asher's parents' house when he found the {{inspiration}} for the song: [...] "I was laying in bed in the Ashers' garret... I was thinking of it as a song for Ringo, which it eventually turned out to be, so I wrote it as not too rangey in the vocal, then started making a story, sort of an ancient mariner, telling the young kids where he'd lived.

40|$|Introduction A major {{task for}} a {{dialogue}} {{system is the}} resolution of fragments. Basic examples include bare NP answers (1), where the bare NP John is resolved as the assertion John saw Mary, and sluicing (2), where the WhP who is interpreted as the question Which student saw John.
