5|$|Command & Conquer {{features}} two sub-plots {{based on}} the two playable factions of the game. Commanding the Global Defense Initiative's troops, the player becomes instrumental in eliminating Nod's European forces. Under the command of General Mark Jamison Sheppard, the player completes missions <b>that</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> securing a beach, to rescuing civilians and scientists, to defending GDI bases from Nod assaults. Combat occurs in countries of Central and Eastern Europe. A major plot element is an international scandal caused by a Nod media manipulation, which convinces {{the world that the}} GDI deliberately attacked and massacred the Polish city of Białystok. This leads to a cut in GDI funding, forcing the player to play several missions with limited forces. Finally, the player besieges the Temple of Nod in Sarajevo, Bosnia, which Kane uses as his main base of operations.|$|E
5|$|In Mission Mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} missions, each with objectives <b>that</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> collecting coins to attacking enemies. In each mission, the player controls a pre-specified character. There are seven levels with eight missions in each. After completing each mission, the player's performance {{is given a}} grade of stars (three, two, or one) or letters (A, B, C, D, or E). After all eight missions in a level are complete, the player must complete a boss mission {{to advance to the}} next level. Once the first six levels are complete, and the rank of at least one star has been obtained on every mission, the seventh level is unlocked.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{success is}} {{dependent}} {{on a variety of}} factors <b>that</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> the plumage exhibited by a male to the composition of the lek itself. In one study, the female Guianan cocks-of-the-rock displayed sexual selection based off sequential comparisons or threshold standards. The hens engaged in a “pool–comparison” tactic, meaning that females chose males of higher rank in courtship. Males of higher rank were those with more matings received from other females; the lower-ranking single males were ignored. The rankings were determined by where the courts were positioned in the lek: courts that were more centrally placed indicated more successful and higher-ranking males. The females in the study were individually observed to aggregate towards larger, more centrally concentrated leks, demonstrating active female choice.|$|E

5|$|Thallium has 25 {{isotopes}} {{which have}} atomic masses <b>that</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 184 to 210. 203Tl and 205Tl {{are the only}} stable isotopes and make up nearly all of natural thallium. 204Tl is the most stable radioisotope, with a half-life of 3.78 years. It is made by the neutron activation of stable thallium in a nuclear reactor. The most useful radioisotope, 201Tl (half-life 73 hours), decays by electron capture, emitting X-rays (~70–80keV), and photons of 135 and 167keV in 10% total abundance; therefore, it has good imaging characteristics without excessive patient radiation dose. It {{is the most popular}} isotope used for thallium nuclear cardiac stress tests.|$|E
5|$|The World Rally Championship (WRC) is a {{rallying}} series administrated by Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body. The series currently consists of 13 three-day events driven on surfaces <b>that</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> gravel and tarmac to snow and ice. Each rally is split into 15–25 special stages, which are run {{against the clock}} on closed roads. The WRC was formed from well-known and popular international rallies, most of which had previously {{been part of the}} European Rally Championship and/or the International Championship for Manufacturers; the series was first contested in 1973. The drivers' championship was first awarded in 1977 and 1978 as an FIA Cup for Drivers title, to Sandro Munari and Markku Alén, respectively. The first official world champion in rallying was Björn Waldegård in 1979.|$|E

Together, these formations represent about 150 million years of mostly Mesozoic-aged sedimentation {{in that part}} of North America. Part of a super-sequence of rock units called the Grand Staircase, the formations exposed in the Zion and Kolob area were deposited in several different environments <b>that</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> the warm shallow seas of the Kaibab and Moenkopi formations, streams and lakes of the Chinle, Moenave, and Kayenta formations to the large deserts of the Navajo and Temple Cap formations and dry near shore environments of the Carmel Formation.|$|E

5|$|Zerg {{buildings}} and units are entirely organic in-game, and all Zerg can regenerate slowly without assistance (though not {{as quickly as}} Protoss shields). Zerg production is far more centralized than with the Terrans and Protoss; a central hatchery must be utilized to create new Zerg, with other structures providing the necessary technology tree assets, whereas the other two races can produce units from several structures. Zerg units tend to be weaker {{than those of the}} other two races, but are also cheaper, allowing for rush tactics to be used. Some Zerg units are capable of infesting enemies with various parasites <b>that</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> being able to see what an enemy unit sees to spawning Zerg inside an enemy unit. In addition, Zerg can infest some Terran buildings, allowing for the production of special infested Terran units.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December 1920, Betelgeuse {{became the}} first star outside the Solar System to have the angular size of its {{photosphere}} measured. Although interferometry was still in its infancy, the experiment proved a success. The researchers, using a uniform disk model, determined that Betelgeuse had a diameter of 0.047arcseconds, although the stellar disk was likely 17% larger due to the limb darkening, resulting in an estimate for its angular diameter of about 0.055". Since then, other studies have produced angular diameters <b>that</b> <b>range</b> <b>from</b> 0.042 to 0.069arcseconds. Combining these data with historical distance estimates of 180 to 815ly yields a projected radius of the stellar disk of anywhere from 1.2 to 8.9AU. Using the Solar System for comparison, the orbit of Mars is about 1.5AU, Ceres in the asteroid belt 2.7AU, Jupiter 5.5AU—so, assuming Betelgeuse occupying {{the place of the}} Sun, its photosphere might extend beyond the Jovian orbit, not quite reaching Saturn at 9.5AU.|$|E

Many insects are attracted to lettuce, including cutworms, which cut seedlings off at the soil line; wireworms and nematodes, which cause yellow, stunted plants; tarnished plant bugs and aphids, which cause yellow, distorted leaves; leafhoppers, which cause stunted growth and pale leaves; thrips, which turn leaves gray-green or silver; leafminers, which create tunnels within the leaves; flea beetles, which cut small holes in leaves and caterpillars, slugs and snails, which cut large holes in leaves. Mammals, including rabbits and groundhogs, also eat the plants. Lettuce contains several defensive compounds, including sesquiterpene lactones, and other natural phenolics such as flavonol and glycosides, which help to protect it against pests. Certain varieties contain more than others, and some selective breeding and genetic modification studies have focused on using this trait to identify and produce commercial varieties with increased pest resistance.|$|E
