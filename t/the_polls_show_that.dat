Sally Hunt has criticised the tax as a rise in fees by stealth: [...] "All <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> the general public will not stomach a rise in university fees. If the Government thinks it can get the public to swallow higher fees {{as some sort of}} graduate tax, it is living in a dream world. We need a proper debate on how to fund our universities, not an exercise in rebranding. We will judge the plans on what they actually do and whether or not students will be forced to pay more, not how the Government markets them." ...|$|E
40|$|The 9 / 11 {{terror attacks}} {{prompted}} {{a large number}} of public opinion surveys in the Islamic world by Gallup, Pew, Zogby, and others seeking to understand the level and nature of muslim antagonism toward America. Far less {{attention has been paid to}} public opinion surveys of Americans concerning their views of Islam, Muslims, and Muslim countries. This thesis sorts through the surveys and presents some surprising findings. First, while American views of Muslim have generally been rather unfavorable, the events of 9 / 11 did not have a marked change on those views. Moreover, Americans tend to make distinctions between Muslims as individuals, toward whom they have a relatively favorable view; Muslim countries, toward which they have a varied view; and Islam as a religion, toward which they have the most negative view. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> misunderstandings about Islam and Muslims are pervasive among Americans. This thesis argues that the American Muslim community must play a leading role in correcting such misperceptions. In the absence of a sustained effort, there is little in the survey data that would lead one to believe that a change in perception is imminent...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In recent years, {{energy policy}} {{has become an}} {{increasingly}} salient political issue in the United States. Rising gas prices, coupled with regional energy shortages and a growing recognition {{of the connection between}} U. S. energy supplies and national security, have led to calls for legislative action. Part of developing a national energy policy lies in un-derstanding public opinion about existing energy sources, public support for various energy strategies, and what the public might be willing {{to do in order to}} conserve energy and reduce U. S. reliance on foreign oil. In this review, we report trends in public opinion from 1974 through 2006 on traditional energy sources, alternative energy sources, and citi-zens ’ priorities on energy alternatives. <b>The</b> <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> concern about the U. S. energy situation is as high now as it was during the nation’s energy crises of the 1970 s. While attitudes about traditional sources of energy are strongly influenced by current economic conditions, citizens are increasingly receptive to alternative sources of energy (e. g., nuclear energy). Citizens also support policy changes that involve the government encouraging conservation through energy efficient appliances, vehicles, and homes and offices. The public voices a growing frustration with President Bush’s, and the Congress’s, handling of the nation’s energy problems, and they express a desire for leadership in finding long-term solutions to the nation’s energy dilemmas...|$|E
