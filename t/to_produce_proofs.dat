Ferdinand had once implicitly {{recognized}} the privilege, but Ferdinand, now {{when he saw the}} privilege turned to use, and such a territory as Liegnitz exposed to the possibility of falling into inconvenient hands, explicitly took other thoughts: and gradually determined to prohibit this ERBVERBRUDERUNG. The States of Bohemia, accordingly, in 1544 (it is not doubtful, by Ferdinand's suggestion), were moved to make inquiries as to this Heritage-Fraternity of Liegnitz. [Ib. i. 322.] On which hint King Ferdinand straightway informed the Duke of Liegnitz that the act was not justifiable, and must be revoked. The Duke of Liegnitz, grieved to the heart, had no means of resisting. Ferdinand, King of the Romans, backed by Kaiser Karl, with the States of Bohemia barking at his wink, were too strong for poor Duke Friedrich of Liegnitz. Great corresponding between Berlin, Liegnitz, Prag ensued on this matter: but the end was a summons to Duke Friedrich,--summons from King Ferdinand in March, 1546, [...] "To appear in the Imperial Hall (KAISERHOF) at Breslau," [...] and to submit that Deed of EBVERBRUDERUNG to the examination of the States there. The States, already up to the affair, soon finished their examination of it (8th May, 1546). The deed was annihilated: and Friedrich was ordered, furthermore, <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>proofs</b> within six months that his subjects too were absolved of all oaths or the like regarding it, and that in fact the Transaction was entirely abolished and reduced to zero. Friedrich complied, had to comply: very much chagrined, he returned home: and died next year,--it is supposed, of heartbreak from this business. He had yielded outwardly: but to force only. In a Codicil appended to his last Will, some months afterwards (which Will, written years ago, had treated the ERBVERBRUDERUNG as a Fact settled), he indicates, as with his last breath, that he considered the thing still valid, though overruled by the hand of power. Let the reader mark this matter; for it will assuredly become memorable, one day.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a procedure for the verification of multi-process systems based on considering {{a series of}} underapproximated models. The procedure checks models with an increasing set of allowed interleavings of the given set of processes, starting from a single interleaving. The procedure relies on SAT solvers ’ ability <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>proofs</b> of unsatisfiability: from these proofs it derives information that guides the process of adding interleavings on the one hand, and determines termination on the other. The presented approach is integrated in a SAT-based Bounded Model Checking (BMC) framework. Thus, a BMC formulation of a multi-process system is introduced, which allows controlling which interleavings are considered.

We present two implementations of this method, which consist of extensions of the Zenon automated theorem prover. The first implementation is a version dedicated to the set theory of the B formal method, while the second implementation is a generic version {{able to deal with}} any first order theory. We also provide several examples of problems, which can be handled by these tools and which come from different theories, such as the B set theory or theories of the TPTP library.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new abstraction-based {{framework}} for deciding satisfiability of quantifier-free Presburger arithmetic formulas. Given a Presburger formula φ, our algorithm invokes a SAT solver <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>proofs</b> of unsatisfiability of approximations of φ.

The SAT-encodings of the approximations of φ are obtained by instantiating the variables of the formula over finite domains. The satisfying integer assignments provided by the theorem prover are then used to selectively increase domain sizes and generate fresh SAT-encodings of φ. The efficiency of this approach derives from the ability of SAT solvers to extract small unsatisfiable cores, leading to small abstracted formulas.

40|$|Recently, {{a growing}} number of studies in the United States have {{provided}} evidence that students have difficulty with proofs in advanced mathematics courses (Moore, 1990, 1994; Weber, 2001). Few research studies, however, have focused on undergraduates ’ abilities <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>proofs</b> and counterexamples in the domain of continuous functions and, more specifically, on Taiwanese undergraduates ’ abilities. In this study, we examine Taiwanese undergraduates ’ performance constructing proofs and generating counterexamples in the context of continuous functions. While this study is not designed as a comparative study, our analysis provides results that may be compared with existing empirical studies. Such comparisons can provide insight into performance differences among undergraduate mathematics students—insights that may be particularly meaningful given that Taiwanese school mathematics students score consistently high on international achievement tests. More importantly, our study has broader implications for instructors who would like to improve undergraduates ’ proof performance in advanced mathematics courses. ...|$|E

The number and diversity of such devices is increasing and the task of combining available resources into workflows becomes a challenge which can hardly be handled by a human user. In this paper we describe how we use RESTdesc, a formalism to semantically describe possible actions of RESTful Web APIs via existential rules to automatically generate and execute such workflows. Our approach makes use of Notation 3 reasoners and their ability <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>proofs.</b> These proofs are interpreted as workflow descriptions which can be easily executed and updated. The latter makes our approach very adaptable to unforeseen situations. By using one rule per possible API call, our system is very modular and easy to maintain; services can be readily added or removed. Our implementation shows how the use of rule-based reasoning can significantly improve the daily work in today’s factories...|$|E
40|$|Arguably Aristotle was {{the first}} in the Western {{tradition}} to insist explicitly on a constitutive connection between logic and rhetoric. Aristotle claimed that "rhetoric is the counterpart of dialectic". By this it seems he meant that central to the expert orator's expertise was a knowledge of the validity of arguments. Indeed, Aristotle insists further that the only essential component of an expertise in rhetoric is an ability <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>proofs.</b> Such a conception of what rhetoric is differed greatly from how his predecessors (we briefly consider Gorgias and Plato) thought about rhetoric. How radical and distinctive Aristotle's conception of rhetoric was has not been properly recognised in recent work on the Rhetoric. Nor has it been recognised that Aristotle spends much of the first chapter deploying arguments to defend his distinctive, proof-centred view of rhetoric. Here, we consider one argument in which Aristotle's distinctive conception of rhetoric is deployed, from which it is clear how pivotal to Aristotelian rhetoric the role of proofs is. Then we will attempt to elucidate Aristotle's argumentative strategies for explaining and defending this distinctive view...|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} sparked {{interest in}} Verifiable Computation protocols, which allow a weak client to securely outsource com-putations to remote parties. Recent work has dramatically re-duced the client’s cost {{to verify the}} correctness of results, but the overhead <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>proofs</b> largely remains impractical. Geppetto introduces complementary techniques for reducing prover overhead and increasing prover flexibility. With Multi-QAPs, Geppetto reduces the cost of sharing state between com-putations (e. g., for MapReduce) or within a single computa-tion by up to two orders of magnitude. Via a careful instantia-tion of cryptographic primitives, Geppetto also brings down the cost of verifying outsourced cryptographic computations (e. g., verifiably computing on signed data); together with Geppetto’s notion of bounded proof bootstrapping, Geppetto improves on prior bootstrapped systems by five orders of magnitude, albeit at some cost in universality. Geppetto also supports qualitatively new properties like verifying the correct execution of propri-etary (i. e., secret) algorithms. Finally, Geppetto’s use of energy-saving circuits brings the prover’s costs {{more in line with}} the program’s actual (rather than worst-case) execution time. Geppetto is implemented in a full-fledged, scalable compiler that consumes LLVM code generated from a variety of apps, as well as a large cryptographic library. ...|$|E
