5|$|The pardalotes are a {{small family}} of very small, brightly {{coloured}} birds native to Australia, with short tails, strong legs and stubby blunt beaks. They feed on insects, generally in <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> eucalypts and nest in burrows. Three species are found in Tasmania, of which one is endemic and endangered.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} of the invertebrate population in <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> Banksia woodland found that mites and ticks (Acari), beetles (Coleoptera) and ants, bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) predominated overall, with the three orders also common on B. ilicifolia, although outnumbered by thrips (Thysanoptera). More arthropods on B. ilicifolia {{might be related to}} a higher nutrient (potassium) level in the leaves. Lower overall numbers of invertebrates on Banksia species were thought {{to be related to the}} presence of insectivorous birds.|$|E
5|$|It is arboreal, mostly feeding {{amongst the}} foliage in <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> trees. Most food is {{obtained}} from the leaves, and less often from the bark or flowers and fruit. The major foraging methods are gleaning from leaves and dead branches, probing under loose bark and in crevices, probing woody fruits of Black Oak, probing flowers of Yorrell (Eucalyptus gracilis) and sallying for insects. The striped honeyeater occasionally hangs upside-down to extract insects.|$|E

5|$|Above is the Great Chamber, an {{impressive}} {{room with a}} barrel ceiling with geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte's arms and those of his wife, Edith Horsey. This ceiling is a rare survival. The wall above the bed displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses, signifying Lyte's loyalty to King Henry VIII (whose government Lyte represented in Somerset). The panelling is 17th century, as are the great four poster bed and the tapestries on the walls. Some of the original oak panelling of the room {{may have been used}} in the construction of <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> the bed.|$|E
5|$|Ficus aurea is {{a fast-growing}} tree. As a hemi{{epiphyte}} it germinates in <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> a host tree and begin {{life as an}} epiphyte before growing roots down to the ground. F. aurea is also a strangler fig (not all hemiepiphytic figs are stranglers)—the roots fuse and encircle the host tree. This usually results {{in the death of}} the host tree, since it effectively girdles the tree. Palms, which lack secondary growth, are not affected by this, but they can still be harmed by competition for light, water and nutrients. Following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, F. aurea trees regenerated from root suckers and standing trees.|$|E
5|$|Many species forage {{for food}} in <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> trees, taking {{advantage}} of serotiny (the storage of a large supply of seed in cones or gumnuts by plant genera such as Eucalyptus, Banksia and Hakea), a natural feature of the Australian landscape in dryer regions. These woody fruiting bodies are inaccessible to many species and harvested in the main by parrots, cockatoos and rodents in more tropical regions. The larger cones can be opened by the large bills of cockatoos but are too strong for smaller animals. Many nuts and fruits lie {{on the end of}} small branches which are unable to support the weight of the foraging cockatoo, which instead bends the branch towards itself and holds it with its foot.|$|E

5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above and beneath the ground and in <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E
5|$|The splendid fairywren is {{predominantly}} insectivorous; its diet includes {{a wide range}} of small creatures, mostly arthropods such as ants, grasshoppers, crickets, spiders and bugs. This is supplemented by small quantities of seeds, flowers, and fruit. They mostly forage on the ground or in shrubs that are less than two metres above the ground; this has been termed 'hop-searching'. Unusually for fairywrens, they may also occasionally forage in <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> flowering gums. Birds tend to stick fairly close to cover and forage in groups as this foraging practice does render them vulnerable to a range of predators. Food can be scarce in winter and ants are an important 'last resort' option, constituting a much higher proportion of the diet. Adult fairywrens feed their young a different diet, conveying larger items such as caterpillars and grasshoppers to nestlings.|$|E

25|$|Most species form long, thin, {{sometimes}} branching stems or stolons {{beneath the}} surface of their substrate, whether that be pond water or dripping moss in <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> a tropical rainforest. To these stolons are attached both the bladder traps and photosynthetic leaf-shoots, and in terrestrial species the shoots are thrust upward through the soil into the air or along the surface.|$|E

25|$|Unusually for cuckoos, {{which take}} insect prey, {{but like the}} closely related koels, fruit forms {{a major part of}} the diet of channel-billed cuckoos. Fruits taken include those of several species of Ficus figs, the fruits of trees in the family Loranthaceae as well as the fruits of the {{introduced}} black mulberry. Also taken are insects, including beetles, butterflies and grasshoppers, and the nestlings and eggs of birds, including apostlebirds, magpie-larks and noisy miners. Birds typically feed in <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> large trees, sometimes in groups and occasionally with other fruit eating birds such as Australasian figbirds and cuckoo-shrikes.|$|E
25|$|Another {{significant}} {{commission was}} {{to design the}} mosaics for each side and beneath <b>the</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> the Albert Memorial. This towering monument set {{on the edge of}} Hyde Park in London commemorates the Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria, who died in 1861. The Queen remained in deep mourning until the ornate structure was unveiled, complete with a gilt statue of her husband. The firm of Salviati from Murano, Venice, had manufactured the mosaics to Clayton and Bell's designs. Not surprisingly, the firm of Clayton and Bell was awarded a Royal Warrant by the Queen in 1883.|$|E
25|$|Camponotus anderseni {{has only}} {{been found in the}} {{mangroves}} of northern Australia. It is found exclusively in twigs of the mangrove tree Sonneratia alba.
