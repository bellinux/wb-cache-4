2500|$|From the {{differential}} geometric point of view, a parameterized Hamiltonian is {{considered as a}} function defined on the parameter manifold that maps each particular set of parameters [...] to an Hermitian operator [...] that acts on the Hilbert space. The parameters here can be external field, interaction strength, or driving parameters in the quantum phase transition. Let [...] and [...] be the -th eigenenergy and eigenstate of [...] respectively. In the language of differential geometry, the states [...] form a vector bundle over the parameter manifold, on which derivatives of these states can be defined.
