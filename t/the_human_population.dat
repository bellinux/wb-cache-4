Contrary to the claim of their Author, there is no convincing evidence that the extinction of megafauna was caused by humans. Intentionally or unintentionally, {{attempt was made to}} force the human-induced extinction of megafauna by assuming an absurdly fast growth of <b>the</b> hypothetical <b>human</b> <b>population</b> in North America. The assumed growth rate was around two-orders of magnitude larger than normally expected. It is well known that the past growth of <b>human</b> <b>population</b> was slow, but in these simulations, the growth of <b>the</b> hypothetical <b>human</b> <b>population</b> was unreasonably fast. However, even under this unreasonable assumption about <b>the</b> growth of <b>human</b> <b>population,</b> computer simulations do not support the postulate of human-assisted extinction of megafauna because there is no clear correlation between the growth of <b>the</b> hypothetical <b>human</b> <b>population</b> and <b>the</b> distributions describing the decline in the population of megafauna.

40|$|The thesis {{research}} studies <b>the</b> Swedish <b>human</b> <b>population</b> with Smith 2 ̆ 7 s macroscopic approach. In demographic statics, {{a couple of}} plots are drawn for each time point (period) of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>populations</b> of Sweden and five other countries namely Belgium, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. One plot is for the probability distribution of a random newborn 2 ̆ 7 s mother 2 ̆ 7 s age. Another is for the net maternity function. These plots {{can be used to}} identify past historical information from the agreement and discrepancy of related curves. In demographic kinetics, important macroscopic parameters are tracked over time for <b>the</b> Swedish <b>human</b> <b>population.</b> Entropy, reproductive potential, logarithmic maternity, and generation times T and t are studied as separate parameters. From their trends of changes, important conclusions are drawn. Entropy has the overall trend to decrease. This is the response of the increasing level of human societal organization. Reproductive potential, logarithmic maternity, T, and t also reveal this kind of information. The important results from them are that many extreme points are significant in history. More important results are obtained from the combinations of macroscopic parameters. Two relations concern the (t, u) vector, where t is the logarithmic generation time and u is a standard deviation: (a) u will decrease as t increases, and vice versa, and (b) a proper scaling factor can make the formula t+ku be constant. The first relation holds for <b>the</b> Swedish <b>human</b> <b>population</b> with a brief exception, but does not apply to the U. S. population. The second relation works for <b>the</b> Swedish <b>human</b> <b>population</b> before 1930. Most importantly, intensive cycles are found with the (r, s) vector, where r is the Malthusian parameter, the rate of natural increase, and s is the perturbation, measuring the deviation from Lotka stability. As separate parameters, it is difficult to find patterns from their trajectories. But nearly regular cycles appear in the tracking of the (r, s) vector. Three intensive cycles are found from <b>the</b> Swedish <b>human</b> <b>population</b> and modeled with Kepler 2 ̆ 7 s second law. Further investigation shows that intensive cycles exist in most of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>populations</b> under study. Their structures are diverse. The intensive cycles of this kind are thought to be related to <b>human</b> <b>population</b> development. A cycle covers at least four five-year periods or twenty years. This is a relatively long time. In the Leslie matrix model, the maximum eigenvalue represents a long term growth rate. Is there some relation between these intensive cycles of <b>the</b> Swedish <b>human</b> <b>population</b> and their maximum eigenvalues? Explorations are made and appear to be intriguing. The maximum eigenvalue changes at similar steps in each of the terms which correspond to the three intensive cycles. Subdominant eigenvalues have a similar performance, with some exceptions...|$|R

However, it exacerbated problems between <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>population</b> and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into {{the establishment of the}} parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife is not good for them. In 1948 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population and need for farmland. People live right next to the park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. <b>The</b> <b>human</b> <b>population</b> also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.|$|E

5|$|Before Spanish {{colonization}} in the 1770s, the San Juan Creek watershed was {{inhabited by}} the Acjachemen or Juañeno Native Americans.

5|$|Chemical {{pesticides}} {{were first}} used around 2500 BC, when the Sumerians used sulphur compounds as insecticides. Modern pest control was {{stimulated by the}} spread across the United States of the Colorado potato beetle. After much discussion, arsenical compounds were used to control the beetle and the predicted poisoning of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>population</b> did not occur. This {{led the way to}} a widespread acceptance of insecticides across the continent. With the industrialisation and mechanization of agriculture in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the introduction of the insecticides pyrethrum and derris, chemical pest control became widespread. In the 20th century, the discovery of several synthetic insecticides, such as DDT, and herbicides boosted this development.|$|E
5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate {{the immune system and}} develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>population,</b> vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.|$|E

5|$|Harmonia {{is set in}} a post-apocalyptic world {{sometime}} in the future. A rapid decline in human civilization began once the population hit its peak of 10 billion, caused in part by pollution and war. During this time, artificially intelligent, emotional androids called Phiroids were developed to serve as partners for humans. Although Phiroids were originally powered by batteries for the first two generations, they were afterwards developed to be powered by eating food, making them nearly indistinguishable from humans. Artificial memories could also be implanted into the Phiroids, making them highly desirable, leading them to be produced in numbers that eventually rivaled <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>population</b> {{at a time when the}} birth rate was already in decline. Eventually, nuclear warfare and the resulting nuclear fallout killed off most of humanity, culminating in a world covered in dark clouds and ash blocking out sunlight, land stripped of vegetation, and an ocean that could no longer support life.
