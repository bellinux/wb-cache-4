25|$|When Anangu {{began their}} {{struggle}} for land rights in 1976, very little prospecting was being conducted at Mintabie. As <b>things</b> <b>turned</b> out, {{the push for}} land rights coincided with a rush on opal exploration. Consequently, {{by the time the}} South Australian Parliament began to seriously consider granting land rights to Anangu, a growing number of opal miners were setting up operations around Mintabie.|$|E

25|$|As <b>things</b> <b>turned</b> out, {{demand for}} the Mark D Minicar was such that a {{decision}} was made to delay the introduction of the Mark E until later. Despite one of the prototypes being used for an extensive European tour in the summer of 1957 by one magazine, it was not until other pre-production cars were tested by the factory immediately prior to full production that issues with the car's handling were revealed.|$|E
25|$|After winning two minor bouts in Germany and enlisting the {{services}} of legendary boxing trainer Emanuel Steward, Klitschko again fought for the vacated WBO title on 10 April 2004, in Las Vegas, against Lamon Brewster. Klitschko sent Brewster to the canvas in the fourth round; however, <b>things</b> <b>turned</b> around in the fifth when Brewster's punches began backing him up. Not defending himself and leaning into ropes for support, Klitschko took a standing eight count. On unsteady legs, Klitschko fell to the canvas after the bell and the referee stopped the fight for his safety.|$|E
25|$|The new pope, Clement X, {{worried about}} the {{influence}} of theatre on public morals. When Innocent XI became pope, <b>things</b> <b>turned</b> even worse; within a few years he made Christina's theatre into a storeroom for grain, although he had been a frequent guest in her royal box with the other cardinals. He forbade women to perform with song or acting, and the wearing of decolleté dresses. Christina considered this sheer nonsense, and let women perform in her palace. In 1675 she invited António Vieira to become her confessor.|$|E

25|$|One {{particularly}} high-profile {{example of}} a duck came in 1948, when Don Bradman was playing his final Test match for Australia, against England at The Oval. In Australia's first innings, Bradman was bowled for a duck by Eric Hollies, causing his Test average to fall from 101.39 to 99.94; had he scored just four runs, his average would have been 100. As <b>things</b> <b>turned</b> out, Australia won the match by an innings, and so Bradman did not get to bat a second time (had he batted, he would have needed at least 104 runs if dismissed or at least four runs if not out to get his average back to 100).|$|E
25|$|Maha Dewi {{proved an}} able governor. She became a much needed ally to her brother, {{who was now}} based out of Donwun, about 100km north of Martaban. Her {{effective}} control of Dagon provided a backstop to Laukpya's forces from coming into the central Pegu province (modern Yangon Region and southern Bago Region). Smim Than-Byat, a brother of Byattaba and Laukpya but loyal to Binnya U, successfully defended the Pegu province from Laukpya's attacks from the west. But <b>things</b> <b>turned</b> for worse in 1369/70. That year, Byattaba's forces drove out Binnya U from Donwun. Binnya U's territory was now reduced to the Pegu province alone. He moved the capital to Pegu (Bago), about 60km northeast of Dagon.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Tartikoff {{left his}} role as NBC's President of Entertainment to take an {{executive}} position at Paramount Pictures. In {{the course of a}} decade, he had taken control of a network with no shows in the Nielsen Top 10 and left it with five. Tartikoff was succeeded by Warren Littlefield, whose first years as entertainment president proved shaky as a result of most of the Tartikoff-era hits ending their runs. Some blamed Littlefield for losing David Letterman to CBS after naming Jay Leno as the successor to Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show, following the latter's retirement as host in May 1992. <b>Things</b> <b>turned</b> around with the launches of new hit series such as Mad About You, Wings, Sisters, Frasier, Friends, ER and Will & Grace.|$|E

25|$|Task Review: Alpha {{decided to}} rent out the Aston Martin and the Pagani Zonda, the latter a risky move {{due to its}} rental price of £2,750 for one day. While the team {{struggled}} to find sales, with Lucinda faring the worst due to sales not being her natural area, <b>things</b> <b>turned</b> around after Lee made a few deals, followed by Lucinda making one sale after shadowing him, and Alex striking a couple of large deals on the Zonda, one made just before the task's deadline. Meanwhile, Renaissance decided to rent out the Ferrari and Spyker, but earned less sales; although Claire and Helene attracted customers to the Spyker, only the former made sales, while Michael had a fruitless search for customer for the Ferari, just missing out a sale from one. Their overall performance effectively ended any chances of winning the task.|$|E
25|$|On 11 July 1803, Racoon, under Commander Austin Bissell, was sailing between Guanaba and St. Domingo in the West Indies {{when she}} sighted a French naval brig {{anchored}} in Léogâne Roads. As Racoon sailed towards her, Bissell {{saw that the}} French had springs on their cables and were ready to engage. Racoon was flying the French flag, and although he was unaware that the war had broken out again between France and Britain, the French captain was wary, rightly so as <b>things</b> <b>turned</b> out. At 2:45p.m. Racoon anchored, also with springs, 30 yards from the brig. She then exchanged her French ensign for the British, and opened fire. The two vessels exchanged fire {{for half an hour}} before the French vessel cut his cables and tried to sail away. Racoon followed and after about another 10 minutes of fire from Racoon, the French brig surrendered.|$|E
25|$|<b>Things</b> <b>turned</b> around, {{and from}} 2001 to 2006, the Twins {{compiled}} the longest streak of consecutive winning seasons since moving to Minnesota, going 85–77 in 2001, 94–67 in 2002, 90–72 in 2003, 92–70 in 2004, 83-79 in 2005, and 96–66 in 2006. From 2002 to 2004, the Twins compiled their longest streak of consecutive league/division championships ever (previous were the 1924 World Champion-1925 AL Champion Senators and the 1969–70 Twins). Threatened with closure by league contraction (along with the Montreal Expos) in , the team battled back {{to reach the}} ALCS before being eliminated 4-1 by that year's eventual World Series champion Anaheim Angels. Their streak of three straight division titles, along with some bitterly fought games, have helped to create an intense rivalry with the Chicago White Sox in recent years, starting with 2000 when the Sox clinched the division at Metrodome, and heating up especially in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2008.|$|E

25|$|<b>Things</b> <b>turned</b> out {{slightly}} otherwise in Aragon, {{where the}} sociolinguistic situation was different, with a clearer Basque-Romance bilingual situation (cf. Basques from the Val d'Aran cited c. 1000), but a receding Basque language (Basque {{banned in the}} marketplace of Huesca, 1349). While the language was chosen as a medium of prestige in records and official statements along with Latin in the early 13th century, Occitan faced competition from the rising local Romance vernacular, the Navarro-Aragonese, both orally and in writing, especially after Aragon's territorial conquests south to Zaragoza, Huesca and Tudela between 1118 and 1134. It resulted that a second Occitan immigration of this period was assimilated by the similar Navarro-Aragonese language, which {{at the same time}} was fostered and chosen by the kings of Aragon. The language fell into decay in the 14th century across the whole southern Pyrenean area and became largely absorbed into Navarro-Aragonese first and Castilian later in the 15th century, after their exclusive boroughs broke up (1423, Pamplona's boroughs unified).|$|E
25|$|The season {{started about}} as well as it could have, as the Washington Redskins started the season 6–2, with their two losses coming by a {{combined}} 11 points to the New York Giants and St. Louis Rams. Furthermore, Redskins star Clinton Portis led the NFL in rushing yards and Jason Campbell was just 40 pass attempts away from breaking Bernie Kosar's record of consecutive passes to start the season without an interception. However, <b>things</b> <b>turned</b> for the worse {{on the eve of the}} 2008 Presidential Election, when they were routed 23–6 by the Pittsburgh Steelers and Clinton Portis' injuries finally caught up to him. The Redskins continued to struggle, falling all the way to 7–7, with their only win during that six-week period being a 3-point victory of the then-2–8 Seattle Seahawks, who would finish the season 4-12. The Redskins managed to upset the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 16, but were eliminated from playoff contention after the Atlanta Falcons defeated the Minnesota Vikings 24–17 that same week. The Redskins lost the final game of the season 27–24 to the San Francisco 49ers, despite having a 17–7 lead at halftime, losing on a Joe Nedney field goal as time expired.|$|E
