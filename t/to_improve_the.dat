5|$|Amino acids {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} {{applications}} in industry, but their main use is as additives to animal feed. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as soybeans, either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids: lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds. In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required <b>to</b> <b>improve</b> <b>the</b> health or production of these animals.|$|E
