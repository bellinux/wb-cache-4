40|$|This paper covers several <b>techniques</b> <b>of</b> <b>intercomparison</b> <b>of</b> Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) {{anisotropy}} {{experiments and}} models of structure formation. It presents the constraints on several cosmological parameters using current CMB observations. 1. Introduction In 1964 Penzias and Wilson [143] discovered the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation as an excess instrument noise with temperature 3 K, coming {{from all directions}} in the sky. Dicke and Peebles et al. (1965) [57] interpreted this as the relic radiation from the Big Bang. The discovery of this relic radiation in conjunction with Hubble's observation of the cosmic expansion in 1927 [100], the synthesis of the light elements, the evolution of radio source counts etc, provided strong support to the hot Big Bang model. Recently the FIRAS instrument on the COBE satellite has confirmed that this radiation has a Planck spectrum with [133]: T 0 = 2 : 726 Î£ 0 : 010 K (95...|$|R
40|$|The {{observed}} {{effects of}} sharp changes in sea surface temperature (SST) on the air-sea fluxes, surface roughness, and the turbulence {{structure in the}} surface layer and the marine atmospheric boundary layer are discussed. In situ flux and turbulence observations were carried out from three aircraft and two ships within the FASINEX framework. Three other aircraft used remote sensors to measure waves, microwave backscatter, and lidar signatures of cloud tops. Descriptions <b>of</b> the <b>techniques,</b> <b>intercomparison</b> <b>of</b> aircraft and ship flux data, and use of different methods for analyzing the fluxes from the aircraft data are described. Changing synoptic weather on three successive days yielded cases of wind direction both approximately parallel and perpendicular to a surface temperature front. For the wind perpendicular to the front, wind over both cold-to-warm and warm-to-cold surface temperatures occurred. Model results consistent with the observations suggest that an internal boundary layer forms at the SST...|$|R

40|$|Observations of {{atmospheric}} carbon monoxide (CO) {{can only be}} made on continental and global scales by remote sensing instruments situated in space. One such instrument is the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), producing spectrally resolved, top-of-atmosphere radiance measurements from which CO vertical layers and total columns can be retrieved. This paper presents a <b>technique</b> for <b>intercomparisons</b> <b>of</b> satellite data with low vertical resolution. The example in the paper also generates the first intercomparison between an IASI CO data set, {{in this case that}} produced by the University of Leicester IASI Retrieval Scheme (ULIRS), and the V 3 and V 4 operationally retrieved CO products from the Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument. The comparison is performed for a localised region of Africa, primarily for an ocean day-time configuration, in order to develop the technique for instrument intercomparison in a region with well defined a priori. By comparing both the standard data and a special version of MOPITT data retrieved using the ULIRS a priori for CO, it is shown that standard <b>intercomparisons</b> <b>of</b> CO are strongly affected by the differing a priori data of the retrievals, and by the differing sensitivities of the two instruments. In particular, the differing a priori profiles for MOPITT V 3 and V 4 data result in systematic retrieved profile changes as expected. An application of averaging kernels is used to derive a difference quantity which is much less affected by smoothing error, and hence more sensitive to systematic error. These conclusions are confirmed by simulations with model profiles for the same region. This technique is used to show that for the data that has been processed the systematic bias between MOPITT V 4 and ULIRS IASI data, at MOPITT vertical resolution, is less than 7 % for the comparison data set, and on average appears to be less than 4 %. The results {{of this study indicate that}} <b>intercomparisons</b> <b>of</b> satellite data sets with low vertical resolution should ideally be performed with: retrievals using a common a priori appropriate to the geographic region studied; the application of averaging kernels to compute difference quantities with reduced a priori influence; and a comparison with simulated differences using model profiles for the target gas in the region...|$|R

The <b>intercomparison</b> was part <b>of</b> the NASA Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE) and was {{conducted during the}} summer <b>of</b> 1989. The <b>intercomparisons</b> were conducted on the Wallops Electra aircraft during flights from Wallops Island, Virginia, and Natal, Brazil. Sulfur measurements intercompared included sulfur dioxide (SO 2), dimethylsulfide (DMS), hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), carbon disulfide (CS 2), and carbonyl sulfide (OCS). Measurement techniques ranged from filter collection systems with post-flight analyses to mass spectrometer and gas chromatograph systems employing various methods for measuring and identifying the sulfur gases during flight. Sampling schedules for the techniques ranged from integrated collections over periods as long as 50 minutes to one- to three-minute samples every ten or fifteen minutes. Several <b>of</b> the <b>techniques</b> provided measurements <b>of</b> more than one sulfur gas. Instruments employing different detection principles were involved in each <b>of</b> the sulfur <b>intercomparisons.</b> Also included in the intercomparison measurement scenario were a host of supporting measurements (i. e., ozone, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, total sulfur, aerosols, etc.) for purposes of: (1) interpreting results (i. e., correlation of any noted instrument disagreement with the chemical composition of the measurement environment); and (2) providing supporting chemical data to meet CITE- 3 science objectives of studying ozone/sulfur photochemistry, diurnal cycles, etc. The results <b>of</b> the <b>intercomparison</b> study are briefly discussed...|$|R
