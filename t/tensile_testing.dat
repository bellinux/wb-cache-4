25|$|Alternative {{methods of}} rupture {{assessment}} have been recently reported. The {{majority of these}} approaches involve the numerical analysis of AAAs using the common engineering technique of the finite element method (FEM) to determine the wall stress distributions. Recent reports have shown that these stress distributions {{have been shown to}} correlate to the overall geometry of the AAA rather than solely to the maximum diameter. It is also known that wall stress alone does not completely govern failure as an AAA will usually rupture when the wall stress exceeds the wall strength. In light of this, rupture assessment may be more accurate if both the patient-specific wall stress is coupled together with patient-specific wall strength. A non-invasive method of determining patient-dependent wall strength was recently reported, with more traditional approaches to strength determination via <b>tensile</b> <b>testing</b> performed by other researchers in the field. Some of the more recently proposed AAA rupture-risk assessment methods include: AAA wall stress; AAA expansion rate; degree of asymmetry; presence of intraluminal thrombus (ILT); a rupture potential index (RPI); a finite element analysis rupture index (FEARI); biomechanical factors coupled with computer analysis; growth of ILT; geometrical parameters of the AAA; and also a method of determining AAA growth and rupture based on mathematical models.|$|E

Ultra High Strength Steel-Fiber Reinforced Concrete (UHS-SFRC) is {{characterized}} by very high compressive and tensile strength that is about 8 times of ordinary concrete, and high ductility owing to the addition of steel fibers.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} correlation between bendability and tensile prop-erties of high-strength steels. Strength and elongation in <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> have traditionally been basic values in evaluating bending properties. Advanced high-strength (AHS) steels often have tendency for strain localization, causing risk of fractures and impairing the shape of the bend. Practice has shown that <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> results, indicating bendability well, are not sufficiently accurate when using AHS steels. Since <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> is a fast, simple and cheap testing method, it would be beneficial to rework it to suit better for predicting of bendability. In this study, the usability of <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> results to predict failures in bending AHS steels has been investigated. The most common failures and failure mechanisms in bending are also presented. Test materials used were 6 mm thick AHS wear-resistant, protection and structural steels with good and poor bending properties. Minimum bending radii were determined and then compared with ten-sile test results to estimate the correlation. Conventional <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> results, fracture surfaces and necking through width and thickness were analyzed.

Results showed that in <b>tensile</b> <b>test,</b> have the best correlation with minimum bending radius with necking through the thickness and actual strain in necking area...|$|R
