50|$|Track spikes are {{placed at}} the bottom of shoes in order to {{increase}} traction and speed. While removable spikes are available, most runners opt for fixed spikes. These spikes {{come in a variety of}} different materials. Originally, spikes were made out of metal due to their strength and hardness. However, German engineers began experimenting with canvas and rubber spikes during the World War, in part to help find a more lightweight material. Finally, in the modern era, the most common type of <b>track</b> <b>spike</b> is made of plastic, due being both cheap and easily molded. This second aspect of plastic is especially important, as spikes need to be made in a variety of different shapes in order to accommodate runners on all different types of surfaces. Needle spikes (3/16") are used on all-weather tracks, Christmas tree spikes (1/4") are especially common on any surface, pyramid spikes are used for cross country runners, and tartan spikes (1/4") are used mostly on rubber tracks.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Advances in {{technology}} and design have generated changes to the traditional <b>track</b> <b>spike.</b> Today, {{there are a number}} of different spike shapes, the four most common being needle, pyramid, post, and Christmas tree and modified Christmas tree (the last two are also referred to as “compression tier”) (see Figure 1). Running magazines, product advertisements, coaches, and manufacturers make claims about the potential effects of each type of spike design and their use in different situations. To our knowledge, these types of claims and other information regarding spikes or track surfaces, have not been tested and reported in the peer-reviewed literature. METHODS: The purpose of this preliminary study was to examine whether different shaped spikes elicit quantifiable differences in energy return on a Mondo track surface, the most commonly used at track venues. Five different shaped spikes all 7 mm in length were used in this study (see Figure # 1). The spikes chosen are those commonly used by athletes on various indoor and outdoor track surfaces. The load-deformation between the spikes the track was measured using a Bose Electroforce 3200 (Eden Praire, MN) testing device. OneWay ANOVAs using Sigma Plot 10. 5 (Systat Inc., Richmond, CA) were performed to test for significant differences between spikes. Tukey post-hoc comparisons were performed at the p= 0. 05 level. RESULTS: Figure 2 shows the ANOVA results [F (4, 49) = 54. 78, p<. 001] and Tukey post-hoc comparison for the energy returned. The MTREE spike generated the greatest amount of energy returned and was significantly different from the other spikes (p<= 0. 05). The PYRA spike generated second largest amount of energy returned and was significant different from the PIN and POST spikes. The PIN or needle spike, as expected, had the least amount of energy returned. All spikes penetrated the track surface. DISCUSSION: The notion that compression spikes have less track penetration is unfounded. All the spikes tested penetrated the track under loads less than 105 N. Considering that vertical ground reaction force (GRF) increases linearly during walking and running from 1. 2 BW to approximately 2. 5 BW at 6. 0 m s− 1 and remains constant during forward lean sprinting at higher speeds, the likehood of any of the tested spikes not penetrating the Mondo track surface seems improbable (Keller et al., 1996). For the Mondo track the spike with the largest energy return was the MTREE design. This MTREE provided the largest spike surface area, which helped it to compress the track. The common PIN design provided the least energy return but absorbed the least amount of energy. All the compression spikes seem to provide larger amounts of energy return when compared to the PIN. The measured energy returned by the various spikes is relatively small (N*mm). However, for this study, the energy return was determined for only one spike while most sprint shoes have a sole plate with up to 10 mounted spikes. While it is difficult to assess how much of the energy returned in the spike-track surface interaction might actually aid the sprinter, these findings are nevertheless noteworthy. It is not uncommon for results in sprint races to be separated by only thousandths of a second, where even small levels of energy return could potentially make the difference between winning or losing a race. CONCLUSION: This study shows that spike design affects the amount of energy returned and absorbed by a Mondo track surface. While all of the spikes tested penetrated the track surface, the modified Christmas tree design returned the most energy on the Mondo surface. Knowledge of which spike design offers the highest energy return on the various track surfaces that athletes compete on could be useful to coaches and athletes, as well as, spike and track manufacturers and thus is worthy of further investigation...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to measure the biomechanical changes that would occur between the use of <b>track</b> <b>spikes</b> and racing flats for a distance running pace of approximately 10 minutes for 2 miles. A total of three Ball State University students served as subjects for the study. They were filmed while running paced trials in both spikes and flats for an approximate distance of 50 meters. The subjects were timed during the last 15 yards after they had built up speed to target pace. The trials that were as close to target pace and to each other were used for analysis of the biomechanical parameters of stride length and stride frequency, support and non-support time, the angle of the lower leg at takeoff and the velocity angle of the center of gravity at takeoff. Results indicated that the velocity of the center of gravity showed significant difference between the use of the two shoe types when computed using statistical tests on the means. It was concluded that within the limitations of this study <b>track</b> <b>spikes</b> could serve as an additional avenue of biomechanical improvement, due to increased velocity, and that a difference in running performance can occur without the intervention of a coach or a purposeful change in technique {{on the part of the}} runner.

40|$|Purpose. Despite {{the steady}} {{increase}} in the length of sections of continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers, wooden railway sleepers, {{as one of the}} options of under-rail bearings, are still operated on a sufficiently large number of areas, in particular, remain uncontested in the curve of up to 350 m radius, {{as well as on the}} main ways of subways. The main types of fasteners in the most common types of intermediate rail fastenings for wooden sleepers are <b>track</b> screws and <b>spikes.</b> Since the «wheel-rail» system contact peculiarities existing in track curved sections have a significant impact on the processes of interaction between the railway track and rolling stock, it is necessary in this work to determine the rigidity of the <b>track</b> screws and <b>spikes,</b> which are directly involved in the formation of spatial rigidity of the intermediate rail fastening nodes under the influence of horizontal transverse forces. Methodology. The study of the <b>track</b> screw and <b>spike</b> rigidity was conducted experimentally for the two types of intermediate rail fastenings – D 0 and «Metro». To carry out experimental tests, 10 test sites were selected on the roads of the regional branch of «Southern Railway» of «Ukrzaliznytsia», and 8 – in the main routes of KP «Kharkiv Metro». Each of the test sites was in approximately the same operating conditions, but had different values of passed tonnage. Findings. The values of the <b>track</b> screw and <b>spike</b> rigidity were obtained. Originality. The authors first obtained the experimental data on variation in rigidity of <b>track</b> screw and <b>spike,</b> depending on the useful life for the main railways and subway routes. This allows calculation of the horizontal shear forces in track curved sections (particularly in curves of up to 350 m radius), as well as the forecast evaluation of their level change during operation. Practical value. Based on the experimental data, it was found that variation in rigidity of <b>track</b> screw and <b>spike</b> depending on the lifetime is nonlinear. These experiments allow a more rational approach to the issue of determining the optimal design of the intermediate rail fasteners, based on the specific operating conditions, and may also contribute to the development of measures to improve the reliability of the components of intermediate rail fastenings for wooden sleepers...|$|R
