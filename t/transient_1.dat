40|$|Cross-talk between tumour and stromal {{cells can}} profoundly {{influence}} cancer cell invasion {{by increasing the}} availability of mitogenic peptides such as endothelin- 1 (ET- 1). Endothelin- 1 is elevated in men with metastatic prostate cancer (PC), and can exert both an autocrine (epithelial) and a paracrine (stromal) influence on growth. Endothelin- 1 is generated from its inactive precursor big-ET- 1 by endothelin-converting enzyme 1 (ECE- 1). We and others have demonstrated that ECE- 1 expression is significantly elevated in tumours and surrounding stromal tissue. Our current data show siRNA-mediated knockdown of stromal ECE- 1 reduces epithelial (PC- 3) cell invasion in coculture. Interestingly, readdition of ET- 1 only partially recovers this effect suggesting a novel role for ECE- 1 independent of ET- 1 activation. Parallel knockdown of ECE- 1 in both stromal and epithelial compartments results in an additive decrease in cell invasion. We extrapolated this observation to the four recognised isoforms ECE- 1 a, ECE- 1 b, ECE- 1 c and ECE- 1 d. Only ECE- 1 a and ECE- 1 c were significant but with reciprocal effects on cell invasion. <b>Transient</b> ECE- <b>1</b> c overexpression increased PC- 3 invasiveness through matrigel, whereas <b>transient</b> ECE- <b>1</b> a expression suppressed invasion. Furthermore, <b>transient</b> ECE- <b>1</b> a expression in stromal cells strongly counteracts the effect of <b>transient</b> ECE- <b>1</b> c expression in PC- 3 cells.

40|$|Abstract—Classical {{mammalian}} transient receptor potential channels form non-selective cation {{channels that}} open {{in response to}} activation of phospholipase C-coupled metabotropic receptors, and are thought to {{play a key role}} in calcium homeostasis in non-excitable cells.

Here we show that in the rat lateral amygdala transient receptor potential channels mediate an excitatory synaptic response to glutamate. Activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors on pyramidal neurons in the lateral amygdala with either exogenous or synaptically released glutamate evokes an inward current at negative potentials with a current voltage relationship showing a region of negative slope and steep outward rectification.

40|$|A speech {{pre-processing}} {{algorithm is}} presented to improve the speech intelligibility in noise for the near-end listener. The algorithm improves the intelligibility by optimally redistributing the speech en-ergy over time and frequency for a perceptual distortion measure, {{which is based on}} a spectro-temporal auditory model. In contrast to spectral-only models, short-time information is taken into ac-count. As a consequence, the algorithm is more sensitive to tran-sient regions, which will therefore receive more amplification com-pared to stationary vowels. It is known from literature that changing the vowel-transient energy ratio is beneficial for improving speech-intelligibility in noise. Objective intelligibility prediction results show that the proposed method has higher speech intelligibility in noise compared to two other reference methods, without modifying the global speech energy.
