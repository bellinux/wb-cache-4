He maintained business relations with Benjamin Frobisher, who <b>went</b> <b>surety</b> for him in 1778 and again in 1783. That year, Frobisher and Chaboillez guaranteed an expedition costing £3,500 which Benjamin and his brother Joseph Frobisher sent to Grand Portage. In 1785, he went into partnership with other Montreal outfitters and merchants at Michilimackinac, one being Étienne-Charles Campion, to form the General Company of Lake Superior and the South. The objective of the 'General Society', was {{to engage in the}} fur trade in the upper Mississippi region for a period of three years. In 1786, Chaboillez joined with McTavish, the Frobisher brothers, James McGill and others merchants to ask Sir John Johnson to establish peace among the Indian tribes in the upper Mississippi region. During the winter of 1792-93 Chaboillez was in partnership with George Edme Young, and they engaged 42 men <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Michilimackinac and the Mississippi.|$|R

And into the power of that uncertain personality which, through the mutability of my humanity, I may hereafter become, should not common sense dissuade you, my dear Frank, from putting yourself? Consider. Would you, in your present need, be willing to accept a loan from a friend, securing him by a mortgage on your homestead, and do so, knowing that you had no reason to feel satisfied that the mortgage might not eventually be transferred into the hands of a foe? Yet the difference between this man and that man is not so great as the difference between what the same man be to-day and what he may be in days to come. For there is no bent of heart or turn of thought which any man holds by virtue of an unalterable nature or will. Even those feelings and opinions deemed most identical with eternal right and truth, it is not impossible but that, as personal persuasions, they may in reality be but the result of some chance tip of Fate's elbow in throwing her dice. For, not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into the first seeds of things, and passing by the accident of parentage predisposing to this or that habit of mind, descend below these, and tell me, if you change this man's experiences or that man's books, will wisdom <b>go</b> <b>surety</b> for his unchanged convictions? As particular food begets particular dreams, so particular experiences or books particular feelings or beliefs. I will hear nothing of that fine babble about development and its laws; there is no development in opinion and feeling but the developments of time and tide. You may deem all this talk idle, Frank; but conscience bids me show you how fundamental the reasons for treating you as I do." ...|$|R

5000|$|Not surprisingly, the electors of Lancashire {{were anxious}} to be {{represented}} in Parliament by one who commanded such great influence both locally and at Court; and, {{in the autumn of}} 1404, at Coventry, Sir Ralph took his seat in the House of Commons for the first time. The session was still sitting when, on 8 Nov., he secured the lease, at £36 6s.8d. p.a. for the next six years, of all grazing rights in the High Peak (the contract being renewed at a later date to last until 1421). Just a few months later, Sir Ralph <b>went</b> <b>surety</b> for John Macclesfield in the court of Chancery. He had already agreed to underwrite the sum of £416 which his second brother, Oliver, owed to the prince of Wales for the wardship and marriage of his young stepson, William Venables. Thanks to another act of royal generosity Oliver, too, had been allowed to marry into a wealthy landowning family whose estates were held by a minor, becoming a figure of some consequence in Cheshire as a result. Sir Ralph’s own relations with the prince grew even closer because of his involvement in the wars against the Welsh, for during the spring and early summer of 1406 he took up arms, possibly in the company of his old friend (Sir) Roger Leche, with whom he was again associated as a mainpernor at this time. On the death of their father, {{during the course of the}} next four years, the three Staveley brothers assumed the task of executing his will. The bulk of his estates descended to Sir Ralph, who not long afterwards began a term as sheriff of Lancashire. It is interesting to note that during his tenure of office his sister’s stepson, Sir John Assheton II*, was twice elected to Parliament, Sir Ralph being responsible for making the return.7 ...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{attention}} {{to higher education}} policies in the knowledge-based society makes {{important to understand the}} relationship between socio-economic family characteristics and educational choices. This paper considers the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college in Argentina as a family's economic decision. The goal is to investigate the impact of family income on the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a university versus the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a community college in Argentina. Using a probit model of the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college, the results of this paper show that the income {{of the rest of the}} family has a positive and statistically significant impact on the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> college. A multinomial logit model (where the choices are no college, community college or university) shows that the income of the rest of the family is important in order to determine the probability <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a community college versus the other two possibilities. Family income also has a positive impact in the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a university versus the other two choices. This model also shows that parents education is an important factor in explaining the decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a university as well as <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a community college.
