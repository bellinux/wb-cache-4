5|$|The King County Superior Court {{ruled in}} April that the {{university}} was exempt from the city's landmarks-preservation ordinance and could go ahead with demolition of the More Hall Annex. While the city and preservationists appealed the decision, they allowed the demolition of the More Hall Annex to proceed by not seeking a stay <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> them responsible for damages compensation. The decision was appealed to the Washington Supreme Court, who ruled in the city's favor, and rejected the university's claimed exemption from the city landmarks preservation ordinance.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{was troubled}} {{by the fact that}} his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not {{determine}} the direction of a spontaneously emitted photon. A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by Newton in his treatment of birefringence and, more generally, of the splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a reflected beam. Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined which of the two paths a single photon would take. Similarly, Einstein hoped for a more complete theory <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> nothing to chance, beginning his separation from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born's probabilistic interpretation of the wave function was inspired by Einstein's later work searching for a more complete theory.|$|E
5|$|Justinian sent another general, Narses, to Italy, but {{tensions}} between Narses and Belisarius hampered {{the progress of}} the campaign. Milan was taken, but was soon recaptured and razed by the Ostrogoths. Justinian recalled Narses in 539. By then the military situation had turned in favour of the Romans, and in 540 Belisarius reached the Ostrogothic capital Ravenna. There he was offered the title of Western Roman Emperor by the Ostrogoths {{at the same time that}} envoys of Justinian were arriving to negotiate a peace <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> the region north of the Po River in Gothic hands. Belisarius feigned to accept the offer, entered the city in May 540, and reclaimed it for the Empire. Then, having been recalled by Justinian, Belisarius returned to Constantinople, taking the captured Vitigis and his wife Matasuntha with him.|$|E

25|$|On 25 August, Giorgi Karkarashvili, the Georgian {{military}} commander, announced via {{television that}} the Georgian forces {{would not take}} any POWs. He promised that no harm would be done to peaceful residents of Abkhazia and that peace talks would be conducted. He warned separatists that if the peace talks wouldn't succeed and if 100,000 Georgians were killed, that the remaining 97,000 ethnic Abkhaz, who supported Ardzinba would perish. Karkarashvili later allegedly threatened the Abkhaz politician, Vladislav Ardzinba, not to take any actions <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> the Abkhaz nation without descendants and thus placed the responsibility for future deaths on Ardzinba personally. Later, his speech {{was used by the}} separatists as propaganda and to justify their own actions.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year the two married {{and not long}} later, Ellen gave birth to Rose (Georgia Bishop). Rose died from cot death and when David discovered Ellen had cheated on him in grief, he too {{had an affair with}} Bridget Hastings (Katie Wolfe). However, as the year ended he realised he still loved Ellen but Bridget's diagnosis with a brain tumour led him to stay with her. In 1999 David and Ellen began an affair and Bridget soon left him. The happiness was short lived however when David was diagnosed with a rare disorder <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> him blind. He retired and the couple decided to move to a lifestyle block in the Hawkes Bay. David and Ellen did not return for David's son Fergus' (Paul Ellis) wedding in 2001 as David was too ill.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years later}} he {{suffered}} a stroke <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> him permanently paralysed {{on the right side}} of his body. Although he learnt to write and draw with his left hand, and had cameras adapted, Beaton became frustrated by the limitations the stroke had put upon his work. As a result of his stroke, Beaton became anxious about financial security for his old age and, in 1976, entered into negotiations with Philippe Garner, expert-in-charge of photographs at Sotheby's. On behalf of the auction house, Garner acquired Beaton's archive—excluding all portraits of the Royal Family, and the five decades of prints held by Vogue in London, Paris and New York. Garner, who had almost singlehandedly invented the photographic auction, oversaw the archive's preservation and partial dispersal, so that Beaton's only tangible assets, and what he considered his life's work, would ensure him an annual income. The first of five auctions was held in 1977, the last in 1980.|$|E
25|$|In 1618, {{after the}} death of Powhatan, his brother Opitchapam, a lame and quite old man, became {{paramount}} chief of the confederacy. Their youngest brother, Opchanacanough, was probably the effective leader, with his friend, war-chief and advisor Nemattanew, and both of them did not believe peaceful relations with the colonists could be maintained. Perhaps in 1620-1621 Opitchapam retired or he was deposed (but possibly he died in 1630) and he was succeeded by his youngest brother, and Opchanacanough and Nemattanew began to predispose plans for the unavoidable war. Having recovered from their defeat commanding Pamunkey warriors during the First Anglo-Powhatan War, they planned to shock the English with an attack <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> them contained in a small trading outpost, rather than expanding throughout the area with new plantations. In the spring of 1622, after a settler murdered his adviser Nemattanew, Opchanacanough launched a campaign of surprise attacks on at least 31 separate English settlements and plantations, mostly along the James River, extending as far as Henricus.|$|E

25|$|Disputes between France and Prussia increased. In 1868, the Spanish queen Isabella II was {{expelled}} by a revolution, leaving that country's throne vacant. When Prussia {{tried to put}} a Hohenzollern candidate, Prince Leopold, on the Spanish throne, the French angrily protested. In July 1870, France declared war on Prussia (the Franco-Prussian War). The debacle was swift. A succession of German victories in northeastern France followed, and one French army was besieged at Metz. After a few weeks, the main army was finally forced to capitulate in the fortress of Sedan. French Emperor Napoleon III was taken prisoner and a republic hastily proclaimed in Paris. The new government, realising that a victorious Germany would demand territorial acquisitions, resolved to fight on. They began to muster new armies, and the Germans settled down to a grim siege of Paris. The starving city surrendered in January 1871, and the Prussian army staged a victory parade in it. France was forced to pay indemnities of 5billion francs and cede Alsace-Lorraine. It was a bitter peace <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> the French thirsting for revenge.|$|E

500|$|Flanders was {{an early}} and strong critic of fellow Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy’s [...] "misdirection of our efforts at {{fighting}} communism” and his role in “the loss of respect {{for us in the}} world at large.” He felt that rather than looking inward for communists within U.S. borders, the nation should look outward at the “alarming world-wide advance of Communist power” <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> the United States and Canada as “the last remnants of the free world.” On March 9, 1954 he addressed Senator McCarthy on the Senate floor, expressing these concerns.

Members of President Eisenhower’s cabinet passed along the message that Flanders should “lay off.” ...|$|E

[...] However, Butcher did not return with them: he stayed in Illinois for several months, returning to Nebraska with only three days left to construct a dwelling on his homestead; failure to do so would mean forfeiting his claim. [...] Butcher, his father, and two of his brothers built and occupied a dugout, saving the claim.

500|$|Musician and cult leader Charles Manson {{interpreted}} several {{songs on}} The Beatles as an inducement for his followers, {{known as the}} Manson Family, {{to carry out a}} series of murders in Los Angeles in August 1969.

500|$|The game's title {{went through}} {{multiple}} revisions during development, with Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami {{saying that he}} went through discussions with Yamakura about ten times and Yamakura stated that about five thousand titles had been suggested. The Japanese subtitle, [...] "Until I Return To Your Side", was proposed and approved at a fairly early stage. The final title was only decided {{two months before the}} mastering process began. The Oraclos Chain was present in early concepts as a means of contrasting with Elena's feminine image, and was born as a gameplay device from discussions on how to best create an action-based experience with limited controls. Alongside this, the team wanted to make the game suitable for gamers not comfortable with action games, so upgrades and equipment repair were added. The boss battles were designed to make players pull on all their available resources, creating puzzles <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>leave</b> players satisfied upon completion. No original music was created for the game, with it instead using samples from western classical music that fitted the concept. While original music was considered, it was dropped as staff felt it would be [...] "too powerful" [...] for an overseas audience.|$|E
