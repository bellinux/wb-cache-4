5|$|Coakley {{summed up}} his {{prosecution}} case on September 22. His {{aim was to}} show the court that a conspiracy had taken placethe mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and agitators had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} all be guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Efe's obverse dies {{show the}} king's name and title, usually spelt {{with a mixture}} of runes and Latin script, with some aspects of the coins {{occasionally}} ill-drawn or omitted altogether. The king's name is generally arranged around the central motif of a pellet (or a cross) within a circle of pellets: this layout probably derived from Northumbrian coins. The reverse dies consisted of a cross and the letters E F E, placed in four sectors that were divided off by lines. It can be shown that Efe did not use his dies in any particular or consistent order. Calculations have been made that suggest <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> his dies remain undiscovered.|$|E
25|$|Bhumibol {{also asked}} the {{commander}} of the police to investigate the killings. Police Commander Sant Sarutanond reopened investigations into the deaths, and again claimed <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the deaths were {{at the hands of the}} police.|$|E
40|$|The employers' {{organisation}} for the Dutch {{agriculture and}} horticulture sector, LTO Nederland, {{is to make}} a quarter of its staff redundant, it was announced in summer 2003. The factors behind the move include a continuing {{decline in the number of}} farmers and the fact <b>that</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> them are joining LTO Nederland...|$|R

25|$|In test matches, bowlers tend to 'work the cracks' using cutters, {{meaning that}} they try {{pitching}} the ball on cracks repeatedly with the result <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the balls that do pitch on cracks unsettles even a well-set batsman.|$|E
25|$|Mandatory HIV testing {{began in}} 1986 and a {{mandatory}} condom {{law was passed}} in 1988. A study conducted in 1995 in two brothels found that condom use in the brothels was consistent and sexually transmitted diseases were accordingly absent. The study also found <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the prostitutes used condoms in their private lives.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposal}} from Barren was for several overlapping services mainly using the North London Line, generally at 20-minute intervals. The suggested routes followed the original North London line service from Broad Street to Richmond, and new services from Barking to Clapham Junction, {{and a third}} service from Ealing Broadway to North Woolwich. However, the continuing antipathy to the railways from the Wilson government, along {{with the lack of}} interest in minor local train services by British Railways' management, meant <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> these initiatives were carried forward.|$|E

25|$|The {{event was}} held at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris four years later but only two {{countries}} competed, Great Britain and hosts France. The French team was mostly represented by English expatriates while the English team was represented by Devon & Somerset Wanderers Cricket Club, so was not nationally selected. It is considered <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the participants would have been good enough to play first-class cricket — only the British side had experience of eight such games in its side through Somerset's Montagu Toller and Alfred Bowerman.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} the horoi clearly {{provided}} immediate economic relief for the most oppressed group in Attica, and it also brought an immediate end to the enslavement of Athenians by their countrymen. Some Athenians had already been sold into slavery abroad and some had fled abroad to escape enslavement – Solon proudly records in verse the return of this diaspora. It has been cynically observed, however, <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> these unfortunates were {{likely to have been}} recovered. It has been observed also that the seisachtheia not only removed slavery and accumulated debt, it also removed the ordinary farmer's only means of obtaining further credit.|$|E
25|$|Demographically, early {{settlers}} of {{the island}} included not only African Americans, but also (largely) English and British Isles settlers, including Irish and Scottish, as well as aboriginal and Hawaiian. The method of land purchase helped {{to ensure that the}} land was used for agricultural purposes and that the settlers were mostly families. Ruth Wells Sandwell in Beyond the City Limit indicates <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the island's early residents were commercial farmers, with most families maintaining subsistence plots and supplementing through other activities, including fishing, logging and working for the colony's government. Some families later abandoned their land as a result of lack of civic services on the island or other factors, such as the livestock-killing cold of the winter of 1862.|$|E

25|$|In Royal Indian Navy (RIN) service, crewing LCAs {{followed}} {{somewhat similar}} lines. By mid-1941 {{members of the}} RIN Reserve and RIN Volunteer Reserve were being trained to operate LCA. In 1942, the RIN began receiving four battalions of Indian army troops to provide crews for landing craft. Seven hundred soldiers of the 9/1st Punjab Regiment volunteered for such a transfer in February 1943. The 15/13th Frontier Force Rifles Regiment voted similarly. These battalions were transferred despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the men had ever seen the sea. Their training suffered severely from lack of landing craft, spares, and trained instructors. From around mid-1943 {{there was also a}} Burma Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in existence working closely among LCA and LCS crews. By 1945, the BRNVR seems to have been formed into the 59th Motor Launch Flotilla. In all likelihood, it had been put together at least partly from those with maritime experience escaping from the 1942 Japanese onslaught in Burma.|$|E
25|$|In {{effect the}} populations of both Assyria and Babylonia had become an ethnic mix of native Akkadians and Arameans. Even though Aramaic was the common tongue of the empire, Akkadian {{continued}} to be the preferred language of royalty and the elites. Rulers, royalty and elites were all trained to speak both Aramaic and Akkadian until, by the 7th century BC, the ruling class was fully bilingual. The rest of the empire was divided into two sects: those who spoke Aramaic and those who spoke Akkadian. Generally, the common people and traders were also bilingual but Aramaic continued to dominate the empire outside Assyria proper. As the Empire fell, only the elite knew {{how to read and}} write the Akkadian script. The savage sacking of Nineveh and Assur, as well as numerous other Assyrian cities, ensured <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> these elites survived to pass on the language, but some cities such as Arrapkha were spared the destruction.|$|E
25|$|The various {{services}} are currently not interoperable, though those {{that use the}} same DRM system (for instance the several Windows Media DRM format stores, including Napster, Kazaa and Yahoo Music) all provide songs that can be played side-by-side through the same player program. Almost all stores require client software of some sort to be downloaded, and some also need plug-ins. Several colleges and universities, such as Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, have made arrangements with assorted Internet music suppliers to provide access (typically DRM-restricted) to music files for their students, to less than universal popularity, sometimes making payments from student activity fee funds. One {{of the problems is}} that the music becomes unplayable after leaving school unless the student continues to pay individually. Another is <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> these vendors are compatible with the most common portable music player, the Apple iPod. The Gowers Review of Intellectual Property (to HMG in the UK; 141 pages, 40+ specific recommendations) has taken note of the incompatibilities, and suggests (Recommendations 8—12) that there be explicit fair dealing exceptions to copyright allowing libraries to copy and format-shift between DRM schemes, and further allowing end users to do the same privately. If adopted, some acrimony may decrease.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} HIV have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is {{the virus that}} was {{initially}} discovered and termed both LAV and HTLV-III. It is more virulent, more infective, and {{is the cause of}} the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower infectivity of HIV-2 compared to HIV-1 implies <b>that</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> those exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to West Africa.|$|R

5000|$|If {{a player}} scores {{a total of}} 63 or more points in these six boxes, a bonus of 35 {{is added to the}} upper section score. Although 63 points {{corresponds}} to scoring exactly three-of-a-kind for each of the six boxes, a common way to get the bonus is by scoring four-of-a-kind for some numbers so <b>that</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> other numbers are needed. A player can earn the bonus even if they score a [...] "0" [...] in an upper section box.|$|R
25|$|Estimates of Gabilondo Ruby {{production}} {{are between}} 250,000 and 300,000 pistols in total. While most Gabilondo produced pistols were of good quality, others were less well made. French officials quickly became aware <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the Spanish Ruby-types had interchangeable magazines, and insisted the manufacturers mark {{the base of}} all magazines. This was to prevent the possibly fatal consequence at {{the front line of}} either not being able to insert a new magazine, or having a loaded magazine detach from the gun in action. Many Ruby-types were plagued by poor finish and incorrectly hardened steel parts which after a short period of use wore so badly that pistols fired on full-auto. On other pistols, the safety mechanism wore out. The good quality Rubies were reliable and accurate, although some users were disconcerted by the lack of a visible hammer. About 710,000 Ruby types were accepted by the French from all sources and by 1920, about 580,000 were still serviceable and in French army stores. Many other allied nations, and some of the new nations created after the War such as Finland and Yugoslavia also used Ruby-type pistols. Gabilondo ceased production in 1919 and switched to more advanced models, but other firms continued to produce the Ruby-type until the Great Depression wiped out many arms producers.|$|E
500|$|Authors {{whose work}} {{appeared}} in Amazing Stories Quarterly include Stanton A. Coblentz, Miles J. Breuer, A. Hyatt Verrill, and Jack Williamson. [...] Critical opinions differ {{on the quality}} of the fiction Gernsback and Sloane printed: Brian Stableford regards several of the novels as being important early science fiction, but Everett Bleiler comments <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the stories were of acceptable quality. [...] Milton Wolf and Mike Ashley are more positive in their assessment; they consider the work Sloane published in the early 1930s to be some of the best in the new genre.|$|E
500|$|It {{is clear}} that the word [...] "king", as used by and of the rulers of Norwegian descent in the isles, was not {{intended}} to convey sovereign rule (that is, that of a High King). This is different from the way the word was used in the emerging Kingdom of Scotland at the time. It should also be borne in mind that different kings may have ruled over very different areas and <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> them can be seen as exerting any kind of close control over this [...] "far-flung sea kingdom". Precise dates are sometimes a matter of debate amongst historians.|$|E

40|$|Structural {{analysis}} has many merits. It {{enables us to}} agitate effectively, to make the links between the immediate problems people experience and the broader power relations which cause them. It can give us intellectual – and, these days, academic – credibility. It can even, when linked as in David Harvey's work to uncovering elite strategies, convince readers or students that the current situation is not written in the stars, and so by implication {{that it can be}} changed. Yet I find myself wishing more and more – as an Irish activist and as one involved willy-nilly in global politics – <b>that</b> somewhat <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> our comrades had invested so much of their time and energy in structural analysis, and (in particular) <b>that</b> <b>fewer</b> <b>of</b> them had invested their professional or political identity in it {{to the point where they}} believe it is possible to read off the movement situation from a "bird's eye" view of reality...|$|R

500|$|CCAF has {{objected to}} {{settlements}} throughout the United States, {{in cases where}} class action lawyers receive cash payments but the plaintiff class receives only discount coupons for further products and services from the defendant company. [...] CCAF argues in those cases <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the coupons are ever used, so the actual payment to plaintiffs is {{much lower than the}} stated amounts. [...] In 2010, CCAF successfully objected to a coupon settlement in a Central District of California class action alleging consumer fraud in the sale of Honda Civic Hybrids; the settlement would have provided $2.95 million in attorneys' fees, but only coupons to the class.|$|E
500|$|A {{disagreement}} arose {{regarding the}} number of chemical weapons sites in contested areas of Syria, with the Syrian foreign minister stating that one-third of sites are in such areas. FSA official Louay Miqdad stated in early October {{that there were no}} chemical weapons in areas occupied by opposition forces, [...] "which is something that the Assad regime itself acknowledges, while these storehouses are also not located on the front, so why should we stop fighting?" [...] According to the OPCW chief, one abandoned site is in rebel-held territory and routes to others lead through rebel-held territory. Malik Ellahi of the OPCW states <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the locations inspectors must visit will be difficult to access.|$|E
500|$|Deusner {{gave the}} album {{a rating of}} 7 out of 10, complimenting the release by adding that, [...] "Madonna is an ideal {{candidate}} for the tribute album treatment, having already inspired several {{in the past but}} none [...] quite as sturdy or as much fun as Through the Wilderness". However he felt <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> the songs were [...] "uninspired", like Drag's version of [...] "Oh Father" [...] and Bubonic Plague's rendition of Who's That Girl. Jon Caramanica from Spin also gave a positive review, saying that the album captures [...] "Madonna's vivacious side, but [...] desperate too". He particularly commended [...] "Crazy for You", saying that [...] "the last 30 seconds of [...] chilling—frontwoman Ariana Delawari and her traditional Afghan backing accelerate feverishly, breaking the sweat Madonna never quite did, or could".|$|E
