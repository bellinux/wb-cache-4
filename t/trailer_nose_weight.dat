50|$|A {{jockey wheel}} is a {{retractable}} adjustable-height wheel {{used on the}} front of trailers with either a single axle (two running wheels) or more close-coupled axles at or near the centre of gravity whereby without additional support, the trailer would not remain 'level'. The jockey wheel is situated close to the towing hitch and has a built-in screw jack to enable the <b>trailer</b> <b>nose</b> to be lifted over the tow ball of a car or other powered vehicle. The screw jack can then be used to gently lower the <b>trailer</b> <b>nose</b> onto the tow ball. Once securely attached to the towing vehicle, the jockey wheel's jacking action is fully retracted for stowage. The jockey wheel is also unclamped and lifted as far as possible to give the greatest ground clearance before reclamping prior to a journey being made.|$|R
25|$|Two prototypes were {{produced}} {{and sent to}} Aberdeen Proving Grounds. They were unsatisfactory because of their heavy <b>nose</b> <b>weight.</b> By the time the first pilot model was midway into being completed, the project was canceled since the army disliked the high superstructure, <b>nose</b> <b>weight,</b> and nearly vertical armor. The project was soon superseded by the T41 project. Later, the prototypes were kept {{on display in the}} Aberdeen Proving Ground until they were destroyed in 1947.|$|R
50|$|The Twinspark and the V6 {{underwent}} handling trials at Arese. The Twinspark displayed very mature driving manners at the limit, {{with minimal}} skid. The V6 displayed a 25% increase in at-the-limit skid, a natural consequence of its greater <b>nose</b> <b>weight.</b>|$|R
5000|$|MILAS: ASW {{version with}} a light torpedo in the <b>nose.</b> <b>Weights</b> 800 kg (including torpedo), 6-meter length, 0.46-meter diameter, and 5 km to 35+ km {{effective}} range, compatible with Otomat standard systems. The MILAS program started in the 1980s, and was finally adopted only by Italian Navy, the French Navy withdrawing from the program due to cost.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{standard}} {{on the length}} of the chain whip. The typical length is also different between north and south China. The chain is shorter in the south which make it more suitable for close quarter fighting. In the north the length could be from the ground to the chin or the ground to the tip of the <b>nose.</b> <b>Weight</b> is heavier for practice and lighter for performance.|$|R
25|$|The T18 Howitzer Motor Carriage was an American {{self-propelled}} gun. Its development {{started in}} September 1941 as a close-support vehicle using the M3 Stuart's chassis. A 75mm howitzer was {{mounted on the}} right front of the vehicle. The gun mount was adapted from the M3 Grant. Two prototypes were produced by Firestone and then sent to the Aberdeen Proving Ground. However, they were unsatisfactory because of their high superstructure and <b>nose</b> <b>weight.</b> Because the Army disliked the high superstructure and nearly vertical armor, the T18 was abandoned in 1942, and soon started a new turreted project, the T41 75mm HMC, {{also known as the}} Howitzer Motor Carriage M8.|$|R
50|$|In the 2008 film The Dark Knight {{featured}} {{an impressive}} practical stunt {{in which a}} large truck and <b>trailer</b> are flipped <b>nose</b> first. This is shot very far back to give the shot more clarity {{and to see the}} flip through its entirety as oppose to cutting mid-way through.|$|R

50|$|Generally {{associated}} with exposure to beryllium levels {{at or above}} 100 μg/m3, it produces severe cough, sore <b>nose</b> and throat, <b>weight</b> loss, labored breathing, anorexia, and increased fatigue.|$|R
50|$|In early January, Jim French won the Dade Metropolitan Handicap by a <b>nose,</b> {{carrying}} top <b>weight.</b> Eleven days later, he came {{fast in the}} Hibiscus Stakes at Hialeah, only to {{be beaten}} by Executioner. Another two weeks later, closing from 10th place, Jim French ran past His Majesty in the Bahamas Stakes. Two weeks passed, and {{he was only a}} head behind His Majesty in the Everglades Stakes. Once again, two weeks later, he finished third behind Executioner from 19 lengths in the Flamingo Stakes.|$|R
40|$|Previous work on car-trailer {{stability}} {{has been}} largely limited to theoretical studies with some reference to practical experience or accident statistics. In this study, extensive and systematic experimental investigations were carried out oil a combined car-adjustable-trailer system. The influence of different trailer parameters on the system high-speed stability was examined by changing the mass, dimensions, and inertial characteristics of a fully adjustable trailer. It {{was found that the}} dominant factors affecting stability were the <b>trailer</b> yaw inertia, <b>nose</b> mass (mass distribution), and trailer axle position. The tyre pressure also affects the stability, although this effect is less significant. It is interesting to see that the trailer mass alone does not dramatically affect the high-speed stability, as this runs contrary to current guidelines relating to limits on the relative mass of the car and trailer. Experimental tests on a friction stabilizer and on car electronic stability programs demonstrate that both of these improve the high-speed stability and help to delay the onset of 'snaking'...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} 17 year-old male with a nasopharyngeal rhabdomyosarcoma who developed postobstructive pulmonary edema (POPE) after removing the endotracheal tube following biopsy. He developed muffled voice, rhinorrhea, dysphagia, odynophagia, and difficulty breathing through <b>nose</b> and <b>weight</b> loss of 20 pounds in the preceding 2 months. A nasopharyngoscopy revealed a fleshy nasopharyngeal mass compressing the soft and hard palate. Head and neck MRI revealed a large mass in the nasopharynx extending into the bilateral choana and oropharynx. Biopsy of the mass was taken under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Immediately after extubation he developed oxygen desaturation, which did not improve with bag mask ventilation with 100 % of oxygen, but improved after a dose of succinylcholine. He was re-intubated and pink, frothy fluid was suctioned from the endotracheal tube. Chest radiograph (CXR) was suggestive of an acute pulmonary edema. He improved with mechanical ventilation and intravenous furosemide. His pulmonary edema resolved over the next 24  h. POPE is a rare but serious complication associated with upper airway obstruction. The pathophysiology of POPE involves hemodynamic changes occurring in the lung and the heart during forceful inspiration against a closed airway due to an acute or chronic airway obstruction. This case illustrates the importance of considering the development of POPE with general anesthesia, laryngospasm and removal of endotracheal tube to make prompt diagnosis and to initiate appropriate management...|$|R
