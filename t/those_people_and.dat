500|$|The dissenters {{acknowledged}} that other children of foreigners—including former slaves—had, over the years, acquired U.S. citizenship through birth on U.S. soil. But they still saw {{a difference between}} <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> U.S.-born individuals of Chinese ancestry, because of strong cultural traditions discouraging Chinese immigrants from assimilating into mainstream American society, Chinese laws of the time which made renouncing allegiance to the Chinese emperor a capital crime, and {{the provisions of the}} Chinese Exclusion Act making Chinese immigrants already in the United States ineligible for citizenship. The question for the dissenters was [...] "not whether [...] was born in the U.S. or subject to the jurisdiction thereof ... but whether his or her parents have the ability, under U.S. or foreign law, statutory or treaty-based, to become citizens of the U.S. themselves".|$|E
500|$|Veronica Mars has {{attracted}} a loyal and dedicated fan base. A group of fans calling themselves the [...] "Cloud Watchers" [...] organized several campaigns to bring more viewers to the series to ensure its continuation. The group hired a plane to fly over the CW offices, carrying a banner reading [...] "Renew Veronica Mars". The group hired street teams in New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Chicago to distribute 30,000 fliers advertising the series' return after its midseason hiatus in the third season. The [...] "Cloud Watchers" [...] raised $50,000 in donations and through the sale of Veronica Mars clothing and tchotchkes. Upon the cancellation of the series, fans sent more than 10,000 Mars Bars to the CW, hoping that the network would reverse its decision and renew the series. Rob Thomas thanked the fans of the series for their efforts, saying [...] "I love <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> they have been so good to me, but it's not going to happen." [...] A feature film continuation was made possible in 2013 through a Kickstarter fund, in which 91,585 fans donated $5,702,153 to get the film made. Fans have also come to refer to themselves and {{be referred to as}} [...] "Marshmallows" [...] by media as well as the cast and crew of the series after a line delivered by Wallace (Percy Daggs III) in the pilot episode: [...] "You're a marshmallow, Veronica Mars. A Twinkie." [...] At the end of the same episode, Veronica in voiceover remarks [...] "Well, you know what they say: 'Veronica Mars, she's a marshmallow.'"

2500|$|Pavel Annenkov {{considered}} Ioann and Fyodor as [...] "loosely based upon" [...] characters, being {{perfectly fine}} {{but only in}} representing their era, not their own historical selves. [...] "They are as loose as King Lear or Hamlet were and, if they do belong more to Russian history than those two belong to English history, that is because no other reality than that of our Old Russia could have inspired [...] in such a way, bringing him such colors, such an essence to freely draw from," [...] the critic wrote. It was the generic closeness of Tolstoy's plays to the Russia of old, Annenkov argued, that made them historic in the truest sense of the word, for [...] "their significance as living testimony to the spirit <b>those</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> their times is beyond doubt".|$|E
2500|$|Ben Shapiro, David Horowitz, Pamela Geller, Bernard Marcus of the Republican Jewish Coalition, Morton Klein and the Zionist Organization of America, and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach defended Bannon {{against the}} {{allegations}} of antisemitism.

The ADL said [...] "we are not aware of any anti-Semitic statements from Bannon.

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Moses {{reminded}} the Israelites {{that they had}} dwelt {{in the land of}} Egypt and had passed through various other nations and had seen the detestable idols of wood, stone, silver, and gold that those other nations kept. Moses speculated that perchance there were among the Israelites some whose hearts were even then turning away from God to go worship the gods of those nations, who might think themselves immune, thinking that they would be safe though they followed their own willful hearts. But God would never forgive them; rather God’s anger would rage against them until every curse recorded in the Torah would come down upon them and God had blotted out their names. And later generations and other nations would ask why God had done that to <b>those</b> <b>people,</b> <b>and</b> they would be told that it was because they forsook the covenant that God made with them and turned to other gods. So God grew incensed at that land and brought upon it all the curses recorded in the Torah, uprooted them from their soil in anger, and cast them into another land, as would still be the case. Concealed acts concerned God; but with overt acts, it was for the Israelites to apply all the provisions of the Torah.
