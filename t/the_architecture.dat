The notional requirements for future data gathering and distribution by this Space Internet have been gathered from NASA's Earth Science Enterprise (ESE), the Human Exploration and Development in Space (HEDS), and the Space Science Enterprise (SSE). This paper describes a communications infrastructure for the Space Internet, <b>the</b> <b>architectures</b> within <b>the</b> infrastructure, and the elements that make up <b>the</b> <b>architectures.</b> <b>The</b> <b>architectures</b> meet <b>the</b> requirements of the enterprises beyond 2010 with Internet 'compatible technologies and functionality.

5|$|Pick {{wanted a}} new type of {{building}} for the more open sites of the stations on the Piccadilly line's extensions. To decide what this new type should look like, he and Holden made a short tour of Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands in July and August 1930 to see the latest developments in modern architecture. Pick was disappointed with much of the new architecture that he saw in Germany and Sweden, considering it either too extreme or unsatisfactorily experimental. <b>The</b> <b>architecture</b> in the Netherlands was much more to his liking, particularly buildings by Willem Marinus Dudok in Hilversum. Although <b>the</b> <b>architecture</b> in Denmark was not considered remarkable, Pick was impressed with the way in which designers there were often responsible for all elements of a building including the interior fixtures and fittings.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>architecture</b> of the Song dynasty (960–1279) {{was noted}} for its towering Buddhist pagodas, {{enormous}} stone and wooden bridges, lavish tombs, and extravagant palaces. Although literary works on architecture existed beforehand, architectural writing blossomed during the Song dynasty, maturing into a more professional form that described dimensions and working materials in a concise, organized manner. In addition to the examples still standing, depictions in Song artwork, architectural drawings, and illustrations in published books all aid modern historians in understanding <b>the</b> <b>architecture</b> of the period.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>architecture</b> of {{the layer}} pyramid {{allows it to}} be {{securely}} dated to the time span between the reigns of king Sekhemkhet and that of king Snofru, {{the founder of the}} 4th Dynasty. Rainer Stadelmann, Miroslav Verner and Jean-Philippe Lauer compare <b>the</b> <b>architecture</b> of the layer pyramid with that of the step pyramids of Djoser and Sekhemkhet, expecting the layer pyramid to have originally consisted of five steps, just as its near-contemporary predecessors. The layer pyramid exhibits at one site both complex developments concerning its substructures and simplifications concerning the building methods employed for the superstructure. According to these egyptologists, the layer pyramid is a clearly advanced version of the buried pyramid of Sekhemkhet.|$|E

Finally, a comparison of the results of implementations is made to establish merits of design and development of parallel architectures for real-time signal processing and control applications...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} four fiber-loop-buffer based {{photonic}} packet switched architectures are compared. It {{is done in}} terms of their packet loss probability and their optical cost under various load conditions for the random traffic model. The recirculating type delay lines are used for the storage of packets to resolve <b>the</b> contention. <b>The</b> <b>architectures</b> use semiconductor optical amplifiers(SOAs) and tunable wavelength converters(TWCs) in the recirculating loop buffer. <b>The</b> <b>architectures</b> have advantage of simultaneous Read/Write and, wavelength reallocation using TWCs in the recirculating loop buffer. Therefore, it improves the switch performance over <b>the</b> <b>architectures</b> using SOAs in the loop buffer. The cost of <b>the</b> various <b>architectures</b> is evaluated by considering FCC (fiber-to-chip coupling) and the WSU (wavelength speed up factor) model...|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that <b>the</b> <b>architecture</b> of government columbaria reflects the outlook of the Singaporean nation. The early columbaria were simple, with few aesthetic ornaments, just like early Singaporean housing flats. The later columbaria have more modern designs, with well-designed landscaped environments, and looking similar to contemporary HDB (Housing and Development Board) flats. These columbaria include the Chua Chu Kang Columbarium and the Mandai Columbarium, which was renovated and expanded in 2004 to accommodate approximately another 60,000 niches. The designs are more elaborate, and are often reminiscent of other structures people often encounter in everyday life. Comparisons have been drawn between <b>the</b> <b>architecture</b> of these columbaria and that of schools and condominiums, and hypotheses have been made that such are deliberate efforts to eliminate the sense of fear and dread traditionally associated with landscapes of death.|$|E
