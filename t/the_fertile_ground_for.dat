This essay does not pretend answering to these two questions, but rather to question the question themselves and try to shed a different light of this essential problematic. Choosing not to consider literature as a stable concept, but rather as an ontologically impermanent one, I try to reflect upon the terms that condition our approach of works and {{of the creation of}} these works. In a large perspective, the notions of “reading” and “writing” are examined through the prism of their incarnations as “works”, and the consequences of this identity have on our critical discourse. In order to read critically, one must thus recognize this immanent instability of our notions and definitions, and begin from there instead of ending there. In other words, the instability of the reading {{is the only way to}} mirror the instability of the works, and to acknowledge their ever-changing form. Far from being innocent, critical reading therefore appears as a radical, but necessary action, a rebellion against the obvious and accepted definitions to which works are too often attached...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, the {{government}} of the Philippines (adhering to the precepts of neoliberalism) has promoted large-scale mining as a method of stimulating economic development. Mining, an activity with substantial potential for environmental harm, is staunchly opposed by the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines, particularly on the island of Samar. The crux of the church’s opposition to mining are the adverse environmental consequences that mining may impose upon the rural poor who, engaging in subsistence agriculture and aquaculture, are vitally dependent upon access to natural resources. Should there be a mining-related environmental disruption, these people will be thrust from subsistence into destitution. The commitment of the church to act on behalf of the poor emanates from the conciliar documents of the Second Vatican Council (1962 – 1965), <b>the</b> <b>fertile</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> liberation theology in the Philippines provided by the Marcos dictatorship (1972 – 1986), and by the commitment of the church in its 1992 Second Plenary Council to become a church of the poor.

40|$|This paper {{undertakes}} {{a literature}} review of {{corporate social responsibility}} (CSR) {{with the emphasis on}} the potential for continual learning in the small to medium enterprise (SME) context. An extensive review of CSR, sustainability and SME literature has been conducted.

This is supported by theoretical concepts that are capable of adapting to the SME environment. Accentuating <b>the</b> <b>fertile</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> further research, this literature review investigates the benefits of continual and collaborative learning of CSR practices in the SME context. It is anticipated that the argued approach will have broad applicability to provide SMEs the flexibility required for the challenges and barriers in taking a broader view of success. Several contributions are made in this paper. The theoretical component of taking a cyclical learning approach (Plan-Do-Study-Act) offers an adaptable framework for the implementation of CSR. This unique approach encourages the SME to take simple and doable steps in moving toward a multiple bottom line perspective. The minimal research exploring the learning and adoption of CSR actions and behaviours in the SME sector are highlighted to expose a rich area for further study.

Through theoretical research and creative practice, I use photography, large-scale installations, moving image projections and two­ dimensional visual images (paintings, drawings and prints) to articulate my relationship to family and memories. Starting with research into masters of the moving image such as Andrei Tarkovsky, photographers of the American 'underclass' Robert Franks, and installation artists Mona Hatoum and Yayoi Kusama, I articulate my own relationship to family and memory through various mediums in my practice. My varied cultural background - Taiwan, Japan, the US, the UK - {{as well as my}} personal experiences, are the basis of my exploration of still photography and the moving image, particularly as projected onto objects and environments, and my development of large-scale installations and two-dimensional works. Through further research into historical painting and printmaking traditions, and contemporary visual artist On Kawara, I explore the tensions and exchanges between the aesthetic concerns of 'east' and 'west' which became the most significant resource for my works. I take inspiration from my culture, background, memories, a traumatised childhood in Taiwan and Japan; my early adulthood in the US and this last decade in UK.

40|$|The burgeoning {{field of}} {{nanotechnology}} opens windows {{between science and}} art. Exploration of this interplay encourages interaction between scientists, artists and educators alike. The image below serves {{as an example of}} <b>the</b> <b>fertile</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> exchange. The substrate that this image captures is made of silicon, the material from which computer chips are made. A thin ({approx} 1 nm thick) chemical coating was applied homogeneously to the silicon. Specific regions of the coating, 600 nm wide (approximately 150 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair), were then locally removed from the silicon via photocatalytic nanolithography (PCNL(Bearinger, Hiddessen et al. 2005)). PCNL engages light, such as from a light emitting diode or an ultraviolet source, to activate molecules that are attached to a transparent mask above the silicon substrate. These molecules can be compounds similar to chlorophyll, the photoactive material that aids plants in photosynthesis, or may be semiconductor materials, such as TiO{sub 2 }. Once these molecules are activated, chemical reactions result in local destruction of the coating on the silicon. Thus, only regions of the coated silicon in close contact with mask are affected. A non-fouling polymer hydrogel ({approx} 10 nm thick) was then grafted to the retained coating. Hydrogels are superabsorbent and are therefore used on the bulk scale in common items including contact lenses and diapers. They also find utility in topical drug delivery and tissue engineering applications. Because the hydrogel is so absorbent, exposing the silicon chip with patterned hydrogel to water vapor from one's breath reveals the pattern that the lithography dictates(Lopez, Biebuyck et al. 1993). The myriad of colors seen in the image are due to optical interference. The thickness of the swollen layer determines the colors that are visible. While the field of view immediately following hydration appears like a big drop of oil shining in the sun, the oil drop appearance breaks up into many small domains as the water vapor evaporates. The base silicon does not retain the water {{in the same way that}} the way the hydrogel does, due to differences in surface tension. Thus, the pattern stands out from the background. In addition to bringing together nanotechnology, polymer chemistry, materials science and optics, this image suggests imposing order to an otherwise chaotic world. This is a repeated theme in nature across multiple orders of magnitude. The interface of this order and chaos is amorphous, and render a Klimt-like vision of reflected light. As this image is just a still in time, it also reminds us that all things and states are transient and that the materials of the earth, just as we individuals, are constantly evolving...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a study of institutional innovation in higher education. After 1989 the structures and systems of higher education in a number of countries in Central and Eastern Europe were exposed to turbulent pressures from their radically changing environments, triggered by the fall of the communist regimes in the region. As a consequence, during the period of transition of the post- communist societies towards democratisation and market reform, new higher education institutions emerged, and new actors entered the higher education scene. Despite the potential of these developments to expose how and why innovative higher education institutions develop, there is a deficit of studies which systematically examine the pathways of change in post-communist higher education, especially from a comparative perspective. This research shortage becomes even more evident if thematically relevant areas are considered - comparative higher education research, research on change and innovation, and the burgeoning body of literature on institutions. As a result, individual explanatory factors, as well as causes of the differences and similarities in the institutional transition remain ambiguous. The study reported in this thesis focused on five higher education institutions established after 1989 in four countries in Central and Eastern Europe. The institutions were selected from a network of innovative higher education institutions, supported by one of the principal non-governmental organisations investing in the reform of post-communist higher education. The study was guided by the following research questions: How did the five higher education institutions develop in the period between 1989 and 2005 ? What descriptive and analytical ideas regarding the establishment and development of their institutions are revealed by participants in the study? The thesis begins with a review of historical developments in higher education in Central and Eastern Europe {{after the fall of the}} communist regimes. Chapters One to Four draw on this historical account to build the structure of the analytical and methodological framework of the study, by incorporating analyses of relevant literature on higher education, institutional theories and innovation. Gaps in existing literature are identified and linked with the rationale of the study, which serves to support the formulation of the research questions. The empirical analysis in Chapters Five to Seven seeks to address the two research questions by examining evidence, generated from interviews with members of the five higher education institutions selected for this study, representatives of organisations supporting the institutions, and documentary evidence. The individual histories of the five higher education institutions and the non-governmental programme which supported them are explored. Evidence of participants' ideas about the innovative strategies of their institutions, the evolution of their institutional missions with the change in the nature of their relationship with the state and their funders, and the challenge of achieving sustainability serves to construct an account of institutional innovation as a dynamic balance between processes of imitation, recombination, transfer and invention. Finally, the findings of the study are discussed with reference to existing research. The insights gained in the study map out <b>the</b> <b>fertile</b> <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> exploring further considerations, relating to the emergent view of institutional innovation in higher education. The idea that innovations and institutions, rather than ruling each other out, could be parts in the same continuous process may be a simple one, but it is an idea worthy of further exploration.
