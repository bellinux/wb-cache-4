5|$|A {{chemical}} analysis of Mexican specimens has shown L.indigo to contain moisture at 951mg/g of mushroom, fat at 4.3mg/g, protein at 13.4mg/g, and dietary fiber at 18.7mg/g, much higher {{in comparison to}} the common button mushroom, which contains 6.6mg/g. Compared to three other wild edible mushroom species also <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> the study (Amanita rubescens, Boletus frostii, and Ramaria flava), L.indigo contained the highest saturated fatty acids content, including stearic acid with 32.1mg/g—slightly over half of the total free fatty acid content.|$|E
5|$|All {{production}} Comet 2s {{were also}} modified {{to alleviate the}} fatigue problems (most of these served with the RAF as the Comet C2), while a programme to produce a Comet 2 with more powerful Avons was delayed.

Comet commercial flights would not resume until 1958.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} Cub Scout Trainer Wood Badge was field <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> 1976. In 1978 the National Council {{decided in}} a half-step backwards that Wood Badge needed to place {{greater emphasis on}} the practical aspects of good troop operation along {{with a variety of}} leadership exercises. Wood Badge was adopted as the official advanced training program for adult Cub Scout Leaders. The modified course blended Scoutcraft skills and troop management practices along with scaled-down content about the leadership competencies.|$|E

5|$|DAB+ is a {{major upgrade}} to DAB, widely used in other {{countries}} in Europe. It was first <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom in 2013 before regular services were launched in 2016. DAB+ is not backwards compatible with DAB so older radios cannot receive DAB+ stations. There are no plans {{in the foreseeable future}} {{for the vast majority of}} BBC and commercial stations to transition from DAB to DAB+. Estimates given by multiplex operator Switch Digital suggests that a third of radio sets in 2016 were DAB+ compatible.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, W.D. Hamilton {{proposed}} a specific but widely applicable handicap mechanism, parasite-mediated sexual selection. He {{argued that in}} the never-ending co-evolutionary race between hosts and their parasites, sexually selected signals indicate health. This idea was <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> 1994 in barn swallows, a species where males have long tail streamers. Møller found that the males with longer tails, and their offspring, did have fewer bloodsucking mites, whereas fostered young did not. The effect was therefore genetic, confirming Hamilton's theory.|$|E
5|$|Military {{strategy}} and military training {{were treated as}} sciences that could be studied and perfected; soldiers were <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> their skills of using weaponry and in their athletic ability.

5|$|Niobium-containing {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, {{but some are}} toxic and should be treated with care. The short- and long-term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two chemicals that are water-soluble, have been <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a median lethal dose (LD50) between 10 and 100mg/kg. For oral administration the toxicity is lower; a study with rats yielded a LD50 after seven days of 940mg/kg.|$|E
40|$|AbstractT 91 ferritic-martensitic {{steel is}} one of the {{candidate}} materials to future fast reactors where lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) is chosen as the coolant. The interaction of the steel with LBE coolant should be investigated by means of mechanical tests and detailed microstructural analysis. Quantitative analysis requires fracture toughness <b>tests</b> <b>in</b> LBE. However <b>tests</b> <b>in</b> LBE are not easily applied with conventional methods due to the conductive nature of LBE. In addition, there are no standards or guidelines for fracture toughness <b>tests</b> <b>in</b> LBE.

40|$|Although <b>testing</b> is {{critical}} <b>in</b> GSD, its application {{in this context}} has not been deeply investigated so far. This work investigates <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> GSD. It provides support for <b>test</b> managers acting <b>in</b> a globally distributed environment. With this it closes a gap. The leading question is ”What problems exist <b>in</b> <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> GSD and {{how can they be}} addressed in projects?”. Decomposing this question we a) identify problems of <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> GSD projects and b) provide good practices to support practitioners <b>in</b> <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> GSD projects. The research is realized in the context of Capgemini sd&m, a German IT provider. Our contribution to solving the stated research problem is a collection of 16 patterns for <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> GSD projects. For practitioners the usage of the patterns is simplified by various views on the patterns. Herewith we stipulate research and support project managers and <b>test</b> managers <b>in</b> the realization of <b>testing</b> <b>in</b> GSD projects. ...|$|R
