The port is able to take in ships measuring up to 1,500 GRT (Gross Register Tonnage), with general cargo area of 50,895 m2 and total developed area of 34 hectares (0.34km2). It is mainly used in handling petroleum, <b>timber</b> <b>products,</b> coal, and building materials.

The research included the development of production, consumption and trade flows for the most significant countries in the European Union and Serbia.

25|$|In 2005 Iran’s {{forest area}} totaled about 11 million hectares, {{approximately}} 7 {{percent of the}} country’s surface area. Adequate rainfall and a favorable climate have created 1.5 million hectares of dense forest in the Caspian region. The remainder is distributed among western forests (3.6 million hectares), southern forests (434,000 hectares), desert forests (620,000 hectares), and forests scattered in other locations. Supervised by the Department of Natural Resources, the Caspian forests produced 820,000 cubic meters of <b>timber</b> <b>products</b> in 2004, more than 90 percent of which was for industrial use. The largest and most valuable woodland areas are in the Caspian region and the northern slopes of the Elburz Mts., {{where many of the}} forests are commercially exploitable and include both hardwoods and softwoods. Although forests and pastures are nationalized and 12 percent of forested land is nominally protected, forest destruction by the private sector is routine. Limited forest areas, mismanagement, and destruction have compelled Iran to import lumber and wood products. In addition, forest fires destroy 20,000 hectares of forest area each year. Between 1954 and 2004, an estimated 41 percent of Iran’s forest land was lost. According to the former director of Iran’s Department of Environment (Iran), the rate of destruction of forestland amounts to 100,000 hectares per year. The cutting of trees is rigidly controlled by the government, which also has a reforestation program.|$|E

2500|$|Forests {{moderate}} the local climate {{and the global}} water cycle through their light reflectance (albedo) and evapotranspiration. They also conserve biodiversity, protect water quality, preserve soil and soil quality, provide fuel and pharmaceuticals, and purify the air. These free ecosystem services are not given a market value under most current economic systems, and so forest conservation has little appeal {{when compared with the}} economic benefits of logging and clearance which, through soil degradation and organic decomposition returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that about 90% of the carbon stored in land vegetation is locked up in trees and that they sequester about 50% more carbon than is present in the atmosphere. Changes in land use currently contribute about 20% of total global carbon emissions (heavily logged Indonesia and Brazil are a major source of emissions). Climate change can be mitigated by sequestering carbon in reafforestation schemes, plantations and <b>timber</b> <b>products.</b> Also wood biomass can be utilized as a renewable carbon-neutral fuel. The FAO has suggested that, over the period 2005–2050, effective use of tree planting could absorb about 10–20% of man-made emissions – so monitoring the condition of the world's forests must be part of a global strategy to mitigate emissions and protect ecosystem services. However, climate change may pre-empt this FAO scenario as a study by the International Union of Forest Research Organizations in 2009 concluded that the stress of a 2.5C (4.5F) temperature rise above pre-industrial levels could result in the release of vast amounts of carbon so the potential of forests to act as carbon [...] "sinks" [...] is [...] "at risk of being lost entirely".|$|E
