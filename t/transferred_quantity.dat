40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} problem of {{transfer}} in a population structured by a continuum vari-able corresponding to the quantity being transferred. The transfer of the quantity occurs between individuals according to specified rules. The model is of Boltzmann type with kernels corresponding to the transfer process. We prove that the transfer process preserves total mass of the <b>transferred</b> <b>quantity</b> and the solutions of the simple model converge weakly to Radon measures. We generalize the model by introducing proliferation of individuals and production and diffusion of the transfer-able quantity. It is shown that the generalized model admits a globally asymptotically stable steady state, provided that transfer is sufficiently small. We discuss an application of our model to cancer cell populations, in which individual cells exchange the surface protein P-glycoprotein, {{an important factor in}} acquired multidrug resistance against cancer chemotherapy...|$|E

This paper presents a quality-of-transmissionorientated adaptive mechanism for streaming of pre-recorded multimedia content.

A feedback scheme, in conjunction with a quality of transmission grading scheme, allows the server to learn the current network conditions. During transmission, the server can switch between different quality versions of the same multimedia content at certain checkpoints to modify the quality of the overall streaming process, and therefore the <b>transferred</b> <b>quantity</b> of data.

Fluid viscosity and thermal conductivity {{are assumed to be}} linear functions of temperature. Using local similarity the flow and heat <b>transfer</b> <b>quantities</b> are found to be functions of four parameters, i. e.

Numerical solutions are obtained by two methods, a shooting technique and Nachtsheim-Swigert technique, for selected values of parameters appropriate for the fluids considered and specific temperatures of the plate and ambient fluid. For assisting flows, there exist solutions for all values of Richardson number while for opposing flows solutions exist only for a finite set of its values and, in addition, there also exist dual solutions.

40|$|The {{forensic}} science community has increasingly sought quantitative methods for conveying {{the weight of}} evidence. Experts from many forensic laboratories summarize their findings {{in terms of a}} likelihood ratio. Several proponents of this approach have argued that Bayesian reasoning proves it to be normative. We find this likelihood ratio paradigm to be unsupported by arguments of Bayesian decision theory, which applies only to personal decision making and not to the transfer of information from an expert to a separate decision maker. We further argue that decision theory does not exempt the presentation of a likelihood ratio from uncertainty characterization, which is required to assess the fitness for purpose of any <b>transferred</b> <b>quantity.</b> We propose the concept of a lattice of assumptions leading to an uncertainty pyramid as a framework for assessing the uncertainty in an evaluation of a likelihood ratio.

40|$|The {{number of}} cells {{and the size of}} the cells in the male {{accessory}} gland, the quantity of accessory gland proteins, and their effects on fitness in males of different ages were studied in Drosophila bipectinata Duda (Diptera: Drosophilidae). Male age was significantly positively correlated with the size of accessory gland, the number of main cells of the accessory gland, the quantity of protein in unmated males, the duration of copulation, the <b>transferred</b> <b>quantity</b> of protein and sperm to the mated female, fecundity, and fertility, while male age was significantly negatively correlated with the size of main cell in the accessory gland and the quantity of protein in mated males. The size of the main cells was significantly positively correlated with the quantity of protein in unmated males but significantly negatively correlated with the size of the accessory gland and the number of main cells in the accessory gland. These results suggest that D. bipectinata young males, with their smaller size of their accessory glands and having fewer and larger main cells in their accessory glands, produced the least quantity of protein and transferred significantly less protein and sperm to the mated female than did middle and old age males. Thus, this study suggests that in D. bipectinata, male age affects the number of accessory gland cells and the quantity of protein in the accessory gland. The size and number of main cells in the accessory gland {{and the size of the}} accessory gland were related to the production of protein.

From a DSP specification, we demon-strate how to synthesize biomolecular reactions that produce time-varying output quantities of molecules {{as a function}} of time-varying input quantities. Unlike all previous schemes for biomolecular computation, ours produces designs that are de-pendent only on coarse rate categories for the reactions (“fast” and “slow”). Given such categories, the computation is exact and independent of the specific reaction rates.
