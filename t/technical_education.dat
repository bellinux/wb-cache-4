5|$|In 1880, Selfe became vice {{president}} of the School of Arts. He supported the school's Working Men's College, but felt a more thorough focus on practical skills was needed. He rejected the non-technical, non-practical approach of the school's model and campaigned instead {{for the establishment of a}} proper institute of <b>technical</b> <b>education,</b> where instructors would be skilled tradesmen with practical industrial experience. He also pushed for the expansion of <b>technical</b> <b>education</b> facilities into the suburban and regional districts.|$|E
5|$|On 1 August 1883 the New South Wales {{government}} made a proclamation which transferred {{control of the}} Technical and Working Men's College to an independent Board of <b>Technical</b> <b>Education,</b> to which Selfe was appointed, and assumed financial responsibility directly. The government also provided funds to fit out workshops in Kent Street that opened in 1886. This was an initiative driven by Selfe, who had admired the workshop teaching model abroad. It represented a major innovation in <b>technical</b> <b>education</b> in New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Selfe was honoured {{during his}} {{life by the}} name of the Sydney suburb of Normanhurst, where his grand house Gilligaloola is a local landmark. He was energetically {{involved}} in organisations such as the Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts and the Australian Historical Society. As president of the Board of <b>Technical</b> <b>Education,</b> he fought consistently for the establishment of an independent system of <b>technical</b> <b>education</b> to serve the needs of a rapidly industrialising society. He was acknowledged upon his death as one of the best-known people in, and greatest individual influences upon, the city of Sydney.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, {{education}} remained a major political issue in New South Wales. While Selfe would not be drawn again into the centre of the fray, he supported the efforts of his sister Maybanke and her second husband Francis Anderson towards education reform. Following the Knibbs-Turner Royal Commission into New South Wales Education in 1902, and the appointment of Peter Board as Director of Education in 1905, many of Selfe's ideas for <b>technical</b> <b>education</b> were implemented. Ultimately, in 1949, a separate Department of <b>Technical</b> <b>Education</b> was created, and the New South Wales University of Technology (later the University of New South Wales) was established at Kensington.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the advent}} of the European system of {{education}} in Mysore, agraharas (Brahmin quarters) provided Vedic education to Hindus, and madrassas provided schooling for Muslims. Modern education began in Mysore when a free English school was established in 1833. Maharaja's College was founded in 1864. A high school exclusively for girls was established in 1881 and was later renamed Maharani's Women's College. The Industrial School, the first institute for <b>technical</b> <b>education</b> in the city, was established in 1892; this was followed by the Chamarajendra Technical Institute in 1913. While the modern system of education have makde inroads, colleges such as the Mysore Sanskrit Pāthaśhāla, established in 1876, still continue to provide Vedic education.|$|E

Like many youths in the years after the Russian Revolution of 1917, he received a <b>technical</b> <b>education,</b> at first in land management where he started as a land surveyor and then in metallurgy.

5|$|Norman Selfe (9 December 1839– 15 October 1911) was an Australian engineer, naval architect, inventor, urban planner and outspoken {{advocate}} of <b>technical</b> <b>education.</b> After emigrating to Sydney {{with his family}} from England as a boy he became an apprentice engineer, following his father's trade. Selfe designed many bridges, docks, boats, and much precision machinery for the city. He also introduced new refrigeration, hydraulic, electrical and transport systems. For these achievements he received international acclaim during his lifetime. Decades before the Sydney Harbour Bridge was built, the city came close to building a Selfe-designed steel cantilever bridge across the harbour after he won the second public competition for a bridge design.|$|E

5|$|Selfe left Mort's in 1877 to {{practise}} as {{a consulting}} engineer at 141 Pitt Street, gaining {{a reputation for}} versatility and originality. Upon his return from an overseas trip through America, Britain and continental Europe in 1884–85, where he visited engineering works and <b>technical</b> <b>education</b> facilities in search of new ideas to take back to Sydney, Selfe {{set up a new}} office in Lloyd's Chambers at 348 George Street. He would later move to No. 279 where he operated the consultancy until his death in 1911. In the late 1890s he employed William Dixson as an engineer, who would later make a major donation of Australiana to the State Library of New South Wales. The collection of Selfe's own papers and drawings have since been donated to the same library that his former employee greatly augmented.|$|E
