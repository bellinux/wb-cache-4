[...] It was {{a column of}} glass five meters high, made up of 128 caryatids of glass, each with a different decoration and size, each spraying a <b>thin</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> into the fountain below. At night the column was illuminated from within, and could change color. It was placed on a cross of concrete covered with decorated plates of glass, and in an ocagonal basin also decorated with colored and black tiles of glass.|$|E

60|$|Jim Blake, {{the latest}} of these {{incoming}} settlers, had chosen a site down in a deep swale that Pan always crossed {{when he went to}} visit his uncle. It was a pretty place, with grass and cottonwoods, and a <b>thin</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> a lonesome and hidden spot which other homesteaders had passed by.|$|E

60|$|The harbour of Fuatino opened before him. It was a {{circular}} sheet <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> five miles in diameter, rimmed with white coral beaches, {{from which the}} verdure-clad slopes rose swiftly to the frowning crater walls. The crests of the walls were saw-toothed, volcanic peaks, capped and halo'd with captive trade-wind clouds. Every nook and crevice of the disintegrating lava gave foothold to creeping, climbing vines and trees--a green foam <b>of</b> vegetation. <b>Thin</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> that were mere films of mist, swayed and undulated downward in sheer descents of hundreds of feet. And to complete {{the magic of the}} place, the warm, moist air was heavy with the perfume of the yellow-blossomed cassi.|$|R
60|$|The sun was by now {{low in the}} heavens, and {{the cows}} left off feeding, and turned their faces home again, {{followed}} by Ardan son of Gorla. At the door of their stable the maiden stood awaiting them, and saying nought to their herd, she sat down and began to milk. But it was not milk that flowed into her pail; instead {{it was filled with}} a <b>thin</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and as she rose up from the last cow the old man appeared outside.|$|E
60|$|Andy {{went off}} to dinner, leaving Matt in sole charge. The snow had cleared away, {{but it was still}} cold, and to keep himself warm, Matt went {{to the rear of the}} {{establishment}} and got his overcoat. He was just putting on the garment when a noise near the show-window attracted his attention. He ran forward, and saw that a <b>thin</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> was coming down through the boards of the ceiling. The water was splashing on some of the stock, and unless it was speedily checked it would do a good bit of damage.|$|E
60|$|Venters saddled {{and led him}} out of the oak thicket, and, leaping astride, rode up the canyon, with Ring and Whitie {{trotting}} behind. An old grass-grown trail {{followed the}} course of a shallow wash where flowed a <b>thin</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The canyon was a hundred rods wide, its yellow walls were perpendicular; it had abundant sage and a scant growth of oak and pinon. For five miles it held to a comparatively straight bearing, and then began a heightening of rugged walls and a deepening of the floor. Beyond this point of sudden change in the character of the canyon Venters had never explored, and here was the real door to the intricacies of Deception Pass.|$|E

50|$|Fountains {{appeared}} in bars and bistros {{in the late}} 1800s as absinthe gained greater popularity. Most often {{it was a large}} glass globe on a tall metal stand that held between two and six spigots. It allowed a small party of drinkers to accurately prepare their absinthe all at once with a slow, <b>thin</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>water</b> but did not require the steady hand required by a carafe.|$|R

60|$|A scream, unexpected, piercing--a scream {{beginning}} at {{once in the}} highest pitch of a woman's voice and then cut short, so short that it suggested the swift work of death--caused Ali to jump on one side away from the hammock, and the silence that succeeded seemed to him as startling as the awful shriek. He was thunderstruck with surprise. Almayer {{came out of the}} office, leaving the door ajar, passed close to his servant without taking any notice, and made straight for the water-chatty hung on a nail in a draughty place. He took it down and came back, missing the petrified Ali by an inch. He moved with long strides, yet, notwithstanding his haste, stopped short before the door, and, throwing his head back, poured a <b>thin</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> down his throat. While he came and went, while he stopped to drink, while he did all this, there came steadily from the dark room the sound of feeble and persistent crying, the crying of a sleepy and frightened child. After he had drunk, Almayer went in, closing the door carefully.|$|E
50|$|Fourteen of {{the fifteen}} fountains {{on the plan}} were {{constructed}} by Bralle between 1806 and 1808. They were built by many different architects, in many different styles, ranging from Egyptian to classical. They all shared the same problem; a shortage of water. Before {{the completion of the}} new canal Napoleon was building to bring water to Paris, the best they could provide was a <b>thin</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> from several different spouts; there was not enough water pressure to shoot water upwards.|$|E

It wasn 2 ̆ 7 t too shiny, so she dropped it into the dish water - not that she was {{particular}} - but sodas were her specialty.

She took another glass from the shelf behind her, jerked {{just the right amount}} of chocolate syrup into it, tipped it sideways, and ran a <b>thin,</b> hard <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> carbonated <b>water</b> clear around the edge of the syrup until it bubbled nearly up to the rim of the glass...|$|R
60|$|He {{is one of}} many tritons, rivers, sea-gods, and aqueous allegories {{similarly}} {{employed in}} Rome and similarly indifferent to what flesh and blood might find the hardship of their calling. I had rashly said to myself that their respective fountains needed the sun on them to be just what one could wish, but the first gray days taught me better. Then the thinly clouded sky dropped a softened light over their glitter and sparkle and gave them a spirituality as much removed from the suggestion of physical cold as any diaphanous apparition would suggest. Then they seemed rapt into a finer beauty than that of earth, though I will not pretend that they were alike beautiful. No fountain can be quite ugly, but some fountains can be quite stupid, like, for instance, those which give its pretty name to the Street of the Four Fountains and which consist of two extremely plain Virtues and two very dull old Rivers, diagonally dozing at each other over their urns in niches of the four converging edifices. They are not quite so idiotic under their disproportionate foliage as the conventional Egyptian lions of the Fountain of Moses, with manes like the wigs of so many lord chancellors, and with <b>thin</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> drooling from the tubes between their lips. But these are the exceptional fountains; there are few sculptured or architectural designs which the showering or spouting water does not retrieve from error; and in Rome the water (deliciously potable) is so abundant that it has force to do almost anything for beauty, even where, as in the Fontana Paolina, it is merely a torrent tumbling over a facade. It is lavished everywhere; in the Piazza Navona alone there are three fountains, but then the Piazza Navona is very long, and three fountains are few enough for it, even though one is that famous Fountain of Bernini, in which he has made one of the usual rivers--the Nile, I believe--holding his hand before his eyes in mock terror of the ungainly facade of a rival architect's church opposite, lest it shall fall and crush him. That, however, is the least merit of the fountain; and without any fountain the Piazza Navona would be charming; it is such a vast lake of sunshine and is so wide as well as long, and is so mellowed with such rich browns and golden grays in the noble edifices.|$|R
60|$|It {{led into}} a walled {{courtyard}} in {{the centre of}} which was a plain cupola of marble with a gate of some pale metal that looked like platinum mixed with gold. This gate stood open. Within it was the statue of a woman beautifully executed in white marble and set in a niche of some black stone. The figure was draped as though to conceal the shape, and the face was stern and majestic rather than beautiful. The eyes of the statue were cunningly made of some enamel which gave them a strange and lifelike appearance. They stared upwards as though looking away from the earth and its concerns. The arms were outstretched. In the right hand was a cup of black marble, in the left a similar cup of white marble. From each of these cups trickled a <b>thin</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> sparkling <b>water,</b> which two streams met and mingled at a distance of about three feet beneath the cups. Then they fell into a metal basin which, although it must have been quite a foot thick, was cut right through by their constant impact, and apparently vanished down some pipe beneath. Out of this metal basin Tommy, who gambolled into the place ahead of us, began to drink in a greedy and demonstrative fashion.|$|R
5000|$|In {{less than}} 200 years, an {{innocent}} and disconnected series of mostly human-caused events conspired {{to transform the}} Southwest from a depositional environment to an erosional one, severely lowering groundwater tables, drying the land and resulting in a bewilderingly high number of ciénaga losses. This period {{can be thought of}} as [...] "The Great Ciénaga Disappearance." [...] What nature painstakingly assembled over a period of some 10,000 years, we humans nearly destroyed in less than 200 years. Most ciénaga habitat has simply disappeared, leaving only a “skeleton” or <b>thin</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> that, absent a concentrated restoration effort, will soon blink out.|$|E
5000|$|Jaishankar Prasad (30 January 1890 15 November 1937) {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous figures in modern Hindi {{literature}} as well as Hindi theatre. In her glowing tribute to Jai Shankar Prasad, the poet- critic Mahadevi Verma says:“Whenever I remember our great poet, Prasad a particular image comes to my mind. A fir tree stands on the slope of the Himalaya, straight and tall as the proud mountain peaks themselves. Its lofty head braves the assaults of the snow, the rain, and the blazing heat of the sun. Violent storms shake its spreading branches, while a <b>thin</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> plays hide-and-seek amongst its root. Even under the most heavy snowfall, the most fierce heat, and the torrential rain, the fir tree holds its head high. Even in the midst of the worst thunderstorm and blizzards, it remains steady and unflinching.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In March 1992, WIMSA {{announced}} it was ready to offer its design to the CFA, NCPC, and other approval agencies. The new design modified the Hemicycle by restoring a low water feature to the central niche and removing the grass circle, {{replacing it with a}} circular reflecting pool and paved plaza. The center of the plaza was slightly lowered, and very low terraces led {{from the edge of the}} pool to the edge of the plaza. Four niches were still pierced to create stairs leading up to the terrace, but now an elevator was added as well to make the memorial handicap-accessible. The tall illuminated pylons were removed, and in their place were 108 horizontal thick glass panels forming an arc in the back of the Hemicycle's terrace. These panels formed the skylight for the memorial below, and Weiss and Manfredi said they would contain quotations from women who served in the military. A <b>thin</b> <b>stream</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> was intended to flow over the panels, as if [...] "carrying" [...] women's voices to the water feature and reflecting pool. Trees still framed the reflecting pool, but underground, behind the Hemicycle, the architects added a curved gallery and placed the rooms — the 250-seat auditorium, the computer room, the exhibition hall, the offices — in sequence. The redesign won high praise from The Washington Post architecture critic Benjamin Forgey. He called it [...] "a significant addition" [...] to the city's memorials, and said it was [...] "a perfect gesture in a proper place at a fitting moment". He also found the design sensitive, consistent, and poetic. The revisions, he said, had not harmed the memorial as they had so many other structures in the city. [...] "...Something definitely was gained. ... The second design is safer than the first, in some particulars more unified, and, in all respects save one, as evocative." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{forecastle}} was a {{place of}} damp desolation. They looked at their dwelling with dismay. It was slimy, dripping; it hummed hollow with the wind, and was strewn with shapeless wreckage like a half-tide cavern in a rocky and exposed coast. Many had lost all they had in the world, but most of the starboard watch had preserved their chests; <b>thin</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> trickled out <b>of</b> them, however. The beds were soaked; the blankets spread out and saved by some nail squashed under foot. They dragged wet rags from evil-smelling corners, and wringing the water out, recognised their property. Some smiled stiffly. Others looked round blank and mute. There were cries of joy over old waistcoats, and groans of sorrow over shapeless things found among the splinters of smashed bed boards. One lamp was discovered jammed under the bowsprit. Charley whimpered a little. Knowles stumped here and there, sniffing, examining dark places for salvage. He poured dirty <b>water</b> out <b>of</b> a boot, and was concerned to find the owner. Those who, overwhelmed by their losses, sat on the forepeak hatch, remained elbows on knees, and, with a fist against each cheek, disdained to look up. He pushed it under their noses. [...] "Here's a good boot. Yours?" [...] They snarled, [...] "No--get out." [...] One snapped at him, [...] "Take it to hell out of this." [...] He seemed surprised. [...] "Why? It's a good boot," [...] but remembering suddenly that he had lost every stitch of his clothing, he dropped his find and began to swear. In the dim light cursing voices clashed. A man came in and, dropping his arms, stood still, repeating from the doorstep, [...] "Here's a bloomin' old go! Here's a bloomin' old go!" [...] A few rooted anxiously in flooded chests for tobacco. They breathed hard, clamoured with heads down. [...] "Look at that Jack!"... "Here! Sam! Here's my shore-going rig spoilt for ever." [...] One blasphemed tearfully, holding up a pair of dripping trousers. No one looked at him. The cat came out from somewhere. He had an ovation. They snatched him from hand to hand, caressed him in a murmur of pet names. They wondered where he had [...] "weathered it out;" [...] disputed about it. A squabbling argument began. Two men brought in a bucket <b>of</b> fresh <b>water,</b> and all crowded round it; but Tom, lean and mewing, came up with every hair astir and had the first drink. A couple of hands went aft for oil and biscuits.|$|R
