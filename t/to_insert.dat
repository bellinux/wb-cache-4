5|$|Another {{option is}} <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> a small pellet of {{medication}} into the urethra, but this requires higher doses than injections {{and may not}} be as effective. Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not very effective or well tolerated. Electrical stimulation of efferent nerves at the S2 level can be used to trigger an erection that lasts as long as the stimulation does.|$|E
5|$|Jay Kennedy (Manchester University) {{claimed in}} several {{articles}} and a book, The Musical Structure of Plato's Dialogues, that Plato counted {{the lines in}} his dialogues in order <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> symbolic passages at regular intervals and thereby formed various musical and Pythagorean patterns.|$|E

5|$|Polistes exclamans live {{in social}} nests that are open combed. This leaves nests very {{susceptible}} to attacks by predators and by parasitoids. Attack by parasitoids {{will occur in}} the nest brood, as the invader will attempt <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> its own offspring into the host’s nest. The two most common parasitoids are Chalcoela iphitalis and Elasmus polistis.|$|E
5|$|Several {{manufacturers}} market prepackaged cricothyrotomy kits, which enable one to {{use either}} a wire-guided percutaneous dilational (Seldinger) technique, or the classic surgical technique <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> a polyvinylchloride catheter through the cricothyroid membrane.

The battalion commenced operations in late June 1965 and initially focussed on defeating the Viet Cong's wet season offensive. During this time US 173rd Brigade, including 1 RAR, conducted a number of operations into War Zone D—a major communist base area at the junction of Phuoc Long, Long Khanh, Bien Hoa and Binh Duong provinces—as {{well as in the}} Iron Triangle in November.|$|E
5|$|For the 2013 campaign, Ryan {{overhauled}} {{his coaching}} staff, promoting Dennis Thurman to defensive coordinator while adding several new coaches including offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg. Newly hired general manager John Idzik emphasized {{there would be}} competition at all positions including quarterback. The Jets drafted Geno Smith {{in the second round}} of the 2013 NFL Draft to compete with Sanchez. Ryan was widely criticized for his decision <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> Sanchez late in a preseason game against the New York Giants after Sanchez suffered a season-ending shoulder injury which led to Smith being named the starter.|$|E

50|$|Though REXX {{is itself}} a 3GL, the VX-REXX {{interface}} allows you to build REXX programs {{using a combination of}} 3GL and 4GL techniques; its drag-and-drop interface <b>to</b> <b>inserting</b> code allows quite complex programs to be built without actually entering any code.|$|R
5000|$|Hydroginella caledonica (Jousseaume, 1876) can parasitize {{sleeping}} fishes of {{the families}} Scaridae, Serranidae and Pomacentridae at coral reefs in New Caledonia by night.

Gravel ended the session by, with no other senators present, establishing unanimous consent <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> 4,100 pages of the Papers into the Congressional Record of his subcommittee. The following day, the Supreme Court's New York Times Co. v. United States decision ruled in favor of the newspapers and publication in The Times and others resumed.

5|$|Hellenization {{was coined}} by the German {{historian}} Johann Gustav Droysen to denote {{the spread of}} Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest. That this export took place is undoubted, and {{can be seen in}} the great Hellenistic cities of, for instance, Alexandria, Antioch and Seleucia (south of modern Baghdad). Alexander sought <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> Greek elements into Persian culture and attempted to hybridize Greek and Persian culture. This culminated in his aspiration to homogenize the populations of Asia and Europe. However, his successors explicitly rejected such policies. Nevertheless, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the successor states.|$|E
5|$|Jack tells Liz and {{the writers}} of TGS Tracy Jordan that he wants them <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> General Electric (GE) {{products}} into the show. The writers express their reluctance in doing product placements for GE (even though during the scene the cast talk about how great Snapple's White Green Tea tastes), but Liz agrees {{on the condition that}} Jack appears in the sketch. The next day, Liz watches a video containing outtakes from Jack's product placement video, where she discovers that he repeatedly forgot his lines after 142 takes. After realizing that he needs help, Liz encourages Jack to go through with the sketch, which he ultimately is able to shoot.|$|E
50|$|Although KSNK {{originated}} its own newscasts {{for many}} years, the station's local operations were progressively cut {{back from the}} mid-1980s onward. By {{the start of the}} 21st century, local news had been reduced <b>to</b> <b>inserts</b> in KSNW's newscasts, and separate identifications had been largely eliminated.|$|R

5|$|June {{was signed}} by the Houston Texans on April 4, 2009 to a one-year {{contract}} worth $1.5million. He was expected to compete with Xavier Adibi and Zac Diles for the weakside linebacker position. However, on August 20, June broke his forearm during morning practice, had surgery <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> a plate that afternoon and was expected to miss 68 weeks. June had previously missed some training camp time due to a knee injury. On August 28, June was placed on season-ending injured reserve due to his injured forearm. He was released with an injury settlement on September 3, making him a free agent.|$|E
5|$|Bond accosts Zukovsky at his caviar {{factory in}} the Caspian Sea, which is then {{attacked}} by Elektra's sawing helicopters. Later, Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was {{in exchange for the}} use of a submarine, currently being captained by Zukovsky's nephew, Nikolai. The group goes to Istanbul, where Jones realises that if Renard were <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. Bond then receives a signal from the locator card M has activated using a clock battery, just before Zukovsky's underling, Bullion blows up the command centre. Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a garrote. Zukovsky and his men seize the tower, but Zukovsky is shot by Elektra, freeing Bond with his cane gun with his last act. Bond frees M and kills Elektra.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise NX-01 was {{designed}} by Doug Drexler, {{and based on the}} features of the Akira-class. The new class itself was designated as NX by the producers, but Drexler referred to it as the Enterprise-class due to the naval tradition of naming the class after the first vessel. Drexler had intended for the ship to be similar in design to the Daedalus-class starship with a sphere-shaped primary hull, but the producers wanted a flat saucer-shaped hull as it was more immediately recognizable as a Star Trek vessel. Drexler deliberately attempted <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> references to The Original Series into the ship. One of these was narrow struts leading from the body of the ship to the warp nacelles – however Dan Curry wanted them made bulkier as seen in ships of later series. Drexler included a leading edge {{at the front of the}} nacelles, and later described that the original struts would have been around a third more than those.|$|E
50|$|It {{can also}} refer to fitting {{something}} {{where it does}} not easily fit. The shortened expression honking (as in honking around town) derives from this term, referring <b>to</b> <b>inserting</b> one's self into a place or situation where one does not easily fit or is not welcome.|$|R
30|$|Stronger {{learners}} paid indeed {{special attention}} <b>to</b> <b>inserting</b> pictures and adding ideal pictures to their recipes.

5000|$|... {{which is}} known as Langer {{correction}} or Langer replacement. This is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>inserting</b> a 1/4 constant factor whenever ℓ(ℓ + 1) appears.
