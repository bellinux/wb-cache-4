5000|$|In 19th-century handwriting, these {{terminals}} {{were often}} elevated, {{that is to}} say written as superscripts (e.g. 2, 34). With the gradual introduction of the typewriter in the late 19th century, it became common to write them on the line in <b>typewritten</b> <b>texts,</b> and this usage even became recommended in certain 20th-century style guides.Thus, the 16th edition of The Chicago Manual of Style states: [...] "The letters in ordinal numbers should not appear as superscripts (e.g., 122nd not 122)", as do the Bluebook and style guides by the Council of Science Editors, Microsoft, and Yahoo. Two problems are that superscripts are used [...] "most often in citations" [...] and are [...] "tiny and hard to read". Some word processors format ordinal indicators as superscripts by default (e.g. Microsoft Word).

40|$|Abstract—Character {{recognition}} is the mechanical or electronic translation of scanned images of handwritten, <b>typewritten</b> or printed <b>text</b> into machine-encoded text.

For the answer of the above problem and for get better efficiency we use the genetic algorithm. It will give the better results from the above methods. The idea of genetic algorithm {{comes from the fact that}} it can be used as an outstanding means of combining various styles of writing a character and generates new styles. Closely observing the ability of human mind in the recognition of handwriting, we find that humans are able to recognize characters even though they might be seeing that style for the first time. This is possible because of their power to visualize parts of the known styles into the unknown character. We try to represent the same power into the machines...|$|R
40|$|Development of OCRs for Indian {{script is}} an active area of {{activity}} today. Optical character recognition (OCR) is the mechanical or electronic translation of images of handwritten, <b>typewritten</b> or printed <b>text</b> (usually captured by a scanner) into machine-editable text. In simple words OCR is a visual recognition process that turns printed or written text into an electronic character based file.

40|$|Abstract: Image Processing is {{nowadays}} {{considered to}} be a favourite topic in the IT industry. It is a field under Digital Signal Processing. One of its major applications is Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR). Intelligent character recognition, usually abbreviated to ICR, is the mechanical or electronic conversion of scanned images of handwritten, <b>typewritten</b> or printed <b>text</b> into machine-encoded text. ICR enables the computer or machine to visualize an image and extract text from it such that it can edit the text, store it, display or print without any scanning and apply techniques like text to speech and text mining to it. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to extract text/characters from a scanned form image. Our system consists of various stages like 1) uploading a scanned image from machine/computer 2) Extraction of text zone from the image 3) recognition of the text and 4) applying post processing techniques (error correction and detection methods). In addition, discussed the form image registration technique, image masking and image improvement techniques are implemented in our system as part of the character image extraction process. In our experiment we show that, the proposed system will get good results then the existing systems and trying to improve the efficiency and accuracy of recognizing the characters from a scanned form image...|$|R
40|$|Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is {{the process}} of {{translating}} images of handwritten, <b>typewritten,</b> or printed <b>text</b> into a format understood by machines for the purpose of editing, indexing/searching, and compression. The process can be broken down into 3 tightly coupled tasks: pre-processing, segmentation, and classification. Human Interactive Proofs (HIPs) are methods used to differentiate between humans and machines on the internet, and are typically implemented as distorted text which the user must correctly transcribe. HIPs should be easy for a machine to automatically generate, easy for a human to solve, and difficult, or impossible, for a machine to solve even if the generation algorithm is publicly available. Ideally, HIPs are a user-friendly method of exploiting the gap between human and machine intelligence. The ASP Security Image Generator v 2. 0 1 generates an 8 -digit, color image where the digits have been vertically shifted, warped and peppered with noise. We present a 3 step process for breaking this HIP. In the pre-processing step, binarization and thresholding techniques remove the majority of the noise from the input image. Segmentation is performed by using candidate split positions and vertical projections to determine segmentation locations. Digit classification is performed by using correlation values of inputs and templates as a distance metric. Using the averaged template set, an overall recognition rate of 72 % has been achieved on a set of 100 testing images. ...|$|R
