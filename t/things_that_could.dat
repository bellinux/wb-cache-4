The Washington Post reported that Cuccinelli had failed to disclose investments in Star Scientific for a year; after realizing the oversight, he corrected it and disclosed the holdings. Cuccinelli has disclosed $18,000 in gifts from Star Scientific's chief executive, Jonnie R. Williams.

Messengers deliver digital content on optical media or hard disks because, despite high speed broadband connections, companies {{find it easier to}} send a disc than to work out how to transmit larger amounts of data than an email account can handle.

It would have been a sellout in Charlotte, and they decided to do something else. That has caused us to pause a little bit and think through the whole relationship."

Journalists were often treated to the [...] "Russell Glower", described as an [...] "icily contemptuous stare accompanied by a long silence".

500|$|The film's {{marketing}} {{has been}} criticized for not advertising it as a musical. Michael Halberstam of the Writers' Theatre said, [...] "By de-emphasizing the score to the extent they did in the trailer, it is possible the producers were condescending to us – a tactic which cannot ultimately end in anything but tears." [...] In the UK, a number of audience members walked out of the film on realizing it was a musical, and complaints that advertisements for the film were deliberately misleading were made to both the Advertising Standards Authority and Trading Standards agency. The studios involved opted for a low-key approach to their marketing. Producer Walter Parkes stated, [...] "All these <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be described as difficulties could also be the movie's greatest strengths." [...] Warner Bros. felt it should take a similar approach to marketing as with The Departed, with little early exposure and discouraging talk of awards.|$|E

500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E
500|$|Newcomer {{conceived}} Joust as a [...] "flying game" [...] with cooperative two-player gameplay; however, he did {{not wish}} to emulate the popular space theme of previous successful flying games like Asteroids and Defender. To that end, Newcomer made a list of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> fly: machines, animals, and fictional characters. After evaluating the positive and negative of each idea, he chose birds, believing that they would have a wide appeal. Newcomer also felt that birds were a good fit as he was familiar with fantasy and science fiction media featuring birds. To further increase his understanding, Newcomer went to the library to study mythology. He felt that the primary protagonist should ride a majestic bird. The first choice was an eagle, but the lack of graceful land mobility dissuaded the designer. Instead, Newcomer chose an ostrich because he thought a flying ostrich was more believable than a running eagle. To differentiate {{between the first and second}} player characters, the developers picked a stork, believing the proportions were similar to an ostrich while the color difference would avoid confusion among players. Newcomer chose vultures as the main enemies, believing that they would be recognizably evil. Anghelo created concept art of the characters as guidance for further design.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} with previous Ace Attorney games, players could identify with Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice; for Ace Attorney Investigations, they wanted players to be {{immersed in the}} game and feel like they are Edgeworth. He said that they think players will feel a connection with Edgeworth and understand his character. As examples of this, Eshiro cited the ability to directly control Edgeworth, and the possibility to see inside his head: the game's logic system was created because the development team wanted to show how Edgeworth thinks. It represents what is happening inside his mind, which Eshiro describes as a [...] "very cool, calm and collected way of thinking". For the rebuttal phases in the game, Eshiro wanted to try out new <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not be done in courtroom battles: during rebuttals, several characters come in and out during each scene at a rapid pace, providing the player with evidence, to create drama with tension. Ace Attorney Investigations has a larger focus on the environment than previous Ace Attorney titles had; previous titles featured gameplay elements in which the player finds contradictions in suspects' statements, whereas the goal of Ace Attorney Investigations is to find things at the crime scene that contradict the evidence the player has. The game's third person perspective was specifically chosen to be different from the main series' first person perspective, and to show the environment so that players can walk around inside it. The game system was designed specifically for Ace Attorney Investigations, with the aim of being different from the main series; therefore, Eshiro felt that a lot of its features should stay within the Investigations series, and not be used in other Ace Attorney titles.|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers behind Twilight {{worked to}} create a film that was as {{faithful}} to the novel as they thought possible when converting the story to another medium, with producer Greg Mooradian saying, [...] "It's very important to distinguish that we're making a separate piece of art that obviously is going to remain very, very faithful to the book.... But at the same time, we have a separate responsibility {{to make the best}} movie you can make." [...] To ensure a faithful adaptation, Meyer was kept very involved in the production process, having been invited to visit the set during filming and even asked to give notes on the script and on a rough cut of the film. Of this process, she said, [...] "It was a really pleasant exchange [...] from the beginning, which I think is not very typical. They were really interested in my ideas", and, [...] "...they kept me in the loop and with the script, they let me see it and said, 'What are your thoughts?'... They let me have input on it and I think they took 90 percent of what I said and just incorporated it right in to the script." [...] Meyer fought for one line in particular, one of the most well-known from the book about [...] "the lion and the lamb", to be kept verbatim in the film: [...] "I actually think the way Melissa [...] wrote it sounded better for the movie [...] {{but the problem is that}} line is actually tattooed on peoples' bodies [...] But I said, 'You know, if you take that one and change it, that's a potential backlash situation. Meyer was even invited {{to create a}} written list of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> not be changed for the film, such as giving the vampires fangs or killing characters who do not die in the book, that the studio agreed to follow. The consensus among critics is that the filmmakers succeeded in making a film that is very faithful to its source material, with one reviewer stating that, with a few exceptions, [...] "Twilight the movie is unerringly faithful to the source without being hamstrung by it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also in the [...] "Ethics", Spinoza {{discusses}} {{his beliefs}} {{about what he}} considers to be the three kinds of knowledge that come with perceptions. The first kind of knowledge he writes about is the knowledge of experiences. More precisely, this first type of knowledge can {{be known as the}} knowledge of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be “mutilated, confused, and without order.” [...] Another explanation of what the first knowledge can be is that it is the knowledge of dangerous reasoning. Dangerous reason lacks any type of rationality, and causes the mind to be in a “passive” state. This type of “passive mind” that Spinoza writes about in the earlier books of The Ethics is a state of the mind in which adequate causes become passions.|$|E
2500|$|Lambert {{demonstrated}} {{these principles}} {{in the only}} way available at the time: by contriving often ingenious optical arrangements that could make two immediately adjacent luminous fields appear equally bright (something {{that could only be}} determined by visual observation), when two physical quantities that produced the two fields were unequal by some specific amount (<b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>could</b> be directly measured, such as angle or distance). In this way, Lambert quantified purely visual properties (such as luminous power, illumination, transparency, reflectivity) by relating them to physical parameters (such as distance, angle, radiant power, and color). Today, this is known as [...] "visual photometry." [...] Lambert {{was among the first to}} accompany experimental measurements with estimates of uncertainties based on a theory of errors and what he experimentally determined as the limits of visual assessment.|$|E
