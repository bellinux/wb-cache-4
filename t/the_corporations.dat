In 1708 Windsor was granted an ex-gratia payment of £55 (equivalent to £ today) plus £25 and £20 to two tenants (equivalent to £ and £ respectively).

25|$|The Court {{held that}} <b>the</b> <b>Corporations</b> power did not enable the Parliament {{to make a}} valid law {{controlling}} the intra-State trading operations of foreign, trading or financial corporations. In giving their reasons, {{each member of the}} Court held that <b>the</b> <b>corporations</b> power does not confer on the Commonwealth Parliament power to create corporations. While four of the judges agreed as to the outcome, there was no majority view of the meaning of the corporation power. As all five members of the Court had been leading participants in the Constitutional Conventions and are properly seen as among the framers of the Constitution, these differences of opinion deny that there was then any settled understanding, accepted by these framers of the Constitution, of what meaning or effect was to be given to <b>the</b> <b>corporations</b> power. Three of the judges, Griffith CJ, Barton & O'Connor JJ, relied upon the doctrine of reserved powers, holding that intra-State trading activities were reserved to the States. The importance of the reserved powers doctrine does not however explain all aspects of the differences in opinion about the ambit of <b>the</b> <b>corporations</b> power, in particular the distinction between regulating a corporations relations with outside parties and regulating the internal affairs of a corporation.|$|E
25|$|The {{court also}} adopted a more {{expansive}} interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>corporations</b> power.

The external affairs power and <b>the</b> <b>corporations</b> power have both been increasingly relied on {{by the federal government}} to extend its authority in recent years.|$|E

This person-thing duality of <b>the</b> <b>corporation,</b> Iwai states, is behind the age-old controversy over what the essence of corporate personality is.
