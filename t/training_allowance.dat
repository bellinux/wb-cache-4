5|$|The {{downward}} {{trend in the}} number of unskilled jobs available throughout the country is continuing. The government believes that the extension of compulsory education until the age of 18 will mean many more young people will leave education in a much better position to find skilled employment. Speaking in March 2007, Chancellor Gordon Brown stated that around 50,000 teenagers would be paid a <b>training</b> <b>allowance</b> to sign up to college-based courses, with estimates on the available number of apprenticeships available to double to around 500,000 by 2020, with 80% being available in England, which will be an increase from the current 250,000 apprenticeships available, offered by 130,000 employers.|$|E
25|$|The Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962 {{authorized}} {{a three-year}} {{program aimed at}} retraining workers displaced by new technology. The bill did not exclude employed workers from benefiting and it authorized a <b>training</b> <b>allowance</b> for unemployed participants. Even though 200,000 people were recruited, there was minimal impact, comparatively. The Area Redevelopment Act, a $394million spending package passed in 1961, followed a strategy of investing {{in the private sector}} to stimulate new job creation. It specifically targeted businesses in urban and rural depressed areas and authorized $4.5million annually over four years for vocational training programs.|$|E

40|$|Providing {{students}} with high quality feedback {{is important and}} can be achieved using computer-based systems. While student and educator perspectives of such systems have been investigated, a comprehensive multidisciplinary study {{has not yet been}} undertaken. This study examines student and educator perspectives of a computer-based assessment and feedback system at undergraduate and postgraduate levels across a range of disciplines, course sizes and educator experience levels. The results suggest that students and educators may enjoy quality, efficiency and quantity benefits from such an approach, without the drawbacks of low personalisation and specificity identified within the literature. Time and effort are, however, required by educators for training and installation. Thus, workload and <b>training</b> <b>allowances</b> are recommended for practitioners, particularly for large courses where group assignments require highly personalised feedback...|$|R
25|$|Marcinko was {{the first}} {{commanding}} officer of this new unit. At the time there were two SEAL teams. Marcinko named the unit SEAL Team Six in order to confuse Soviet intelligence as {{to the number of}} actual SEAL teams in existence. The unit's plankowners (founding members) were hand-picked by Marcinko from throughout the UDT/SEAL community. SEAL Team Six became the U.S. Navy's premier counter-terrorist unit. It has been compared to the U.S. Army's Delta Force. Marcinko held the command of SEAL Team Six for three years, from 1980 to 1983, instead of the typical two-year command in the Navy at the time. SEAL Team Six was formally created in October 1980, and an intense, progressive work-up training program made the unit mission-ready just six months later. SEAL Team Six started with 75 shooters. According to Marcinko, the annual ammunition <b>training</b> <b>allowance</b> for the command was larger than that of the entire U.S. Marine Corps. The unit has virtually unlimited resources at its disposal.|$|E

5000|$|In July 2009, Bennett {{deliberately}} {{released the}} benefit details of two beneficiaries, Natasha Fuller and Jennifer Johnston, who had criticised the Government's policy of abolishing the <b>Training</b> Initiative <b>Allowance</b> (TIA). Bennett said she believed she had [...] "implied consent" [...] {{for the release}} of the information.|$|R
5000|$|Bennett {{has been}} criticised by opponents for the {{inconsistency}} between her personal story of previous reliance on government social welfare benefits, including {{financial support for}} tertiary study, and a [...] "hardline" [...] approach to benefit policies when she became a Minister. In particular, the <b>Training</b> Incentive <b>Allowance</b> (TIA) was abolished under her leadership, after she had received this allowance herself as a student.|$|R
30|$|Given by the {{institutional}} settings in the German vocational system, young adults can come off benefits through training entry by access to <b>training</b> <b>allowances</b> that may substitute social benefits depending on {{type of training}} and familial circumstances as already mentioned in the previous section. But young beneficiaries who do not receive allowances and whose families cannot meet the basic needs of the household are supported by the benefit system as long they follow education and training anticipating better labour market prospects after graduation; they are currently not available for activation and labour market integration. And participation in regular training is usually binding for several years until graduation 3 (Blossfeld 1988). These considerations of {{the institutional}} settings for young beneficiaries during school-to-work transitions lead to the assumption for the empirical analysis that young adults should {{be less likely to}} come off benefits as long they are involved in regular qualification activities (Hypothesis 4).|$|R

50|$|The {{difference}} was distinguished by whether the trainee was recruited by an employer and provided with {{training for the}} company needs or if the trainee was being trained by a training organisation using employers as training placements. Often, employed status trainees would have their <b>training</b> <b>allowance</b> improved by the employer.|$|E
30|$|Some changes {{took place}} in labour market policy during the crisis. There was a {{remarkable}} shift in National Labour Market Board 4 policy in 2010. When before the crisis, the training was dominantly labour policy measure, then in 2010 it was replaced with employment subsidies. The amount of <b>training</b> <b>allowances</b> were reduced by 50 % and the same amount {{was added to the}} employment subsidies. Rationality behind this shift was very clear: why just spend on training while vacancies almost disappeared and unemployment rate rose to 20 %. Instead, people should be kept at work, so that they could at least pay their everyday bills. Along the same lines was the social policy in the capital city, Tallinn. The organisation and financing of public jobs was the responsibility of local governments. Tallinn created a few thousand so-called social jobs during the crisis in order to provide at least a minimum income for low skilled labour.|$|R
30|$|Since 2005, {{the number}} of 15 - to 24 -year-olds in receipt of {{benefits}} has consistently been around a million (German Federal Employment Agency 2008); this {{number of young people}} corresponds approximately 10 per cent of all young Germans in this age group (Popp and Schels 2008). Overall, the population of young beneficiaries in Germany is very heterogeneous; and this group is revisited in the analysis of the study. In January  2005 almost half of beneficiaries aged  18 to  24 were unemployed or participating in training schemes. Furthermore, one tenth of young benefit clients were employees with insufficient earnings who have been additionally supported by the social benefit (Popp et al. 2006). However, benefits receipt by young adults could also be caused by family circumstances if they are living with an unemployed partner or parent (Popp and Schels 2008). Therefore more than one third of the young people were in various further activities: they were attending school or vocational training or were on parental leave (Popp et al. 2006). In general, students and trainees in regular education are no longer eligible to claim benefits when receiving <b>training</b> <b>allowances,</b> but there are exceptions depending on the familial situation and the type of school and vocational training.|$|R
40|$|This report summarises {{the changes}} OECD {{countries}} {{have made to}} their labour market policies {{in response to the}} downturn, as of mid- 2009. All countries have implemented one or more changes to directly sustain labour demand, either through expanding job subsidy or public sector job creation programmes, lowering employer social contributions, establishing or expanding short-time work schemes, or some combination of the three.  On policies to improve the employment prospects of the unemployed, much of the focus is on expanding the capacity of public employment services, job search assistance and training programmes. Relatively few countries have formally altered activation or mutual obligation requirements in response to worsening labour market conditions, and where they have, requirements have been tightened in most cases.  Around half of OECD countries have moved to increase the incomes of job losers by increasing the generosity of unemployment benefits or extending coverage to those previously excluded. A number of countries have also provided new or expanded support for job losers through social assistance, <b>training</b> <b>allowances,</b> housing support or health insurance.  While most of the policy responses have focused on those out of work {{as the result of the}} downturn, a number of countries have stepped up resources for training existing workers or apprentices to improve their labour market prospects or provide income support for low income earners through the tax system...|$|R

When {{attached}} to the 8th Tank Battalion, Rochester was the location of the Headquarters and Service company. At the birth of the company, they trained with the M4A3E8, a tank designed under the M4 Sherman umbrella. The 8th Tank Battalion was deployed during the Korean War, comprising 520 Marines. Once arriving to their duty station in California, the Marines were divided into different units that were deploying to the Korean Theater. Four decades later, the Rochester Marines deployed in December 1990 to Southwest Asia, and saw combat in the Gulf War. Assigned to the 2nd Marine Division based in Camp Lejeune, the company provided support to the 6th and 8th Marine Regiments. While conducting combat missions in support of Desert Storm, the Rochester Marines captured an Iraqi Republican Guard T-72 tank. Following their return home, the 8th Tank Battalion was demobilized in March 1991, resulting in a five-year transition period for the Rochester Marines to upgrade their equipment, while also operating with a much smaller <b>training</b> <b>allowance.</b> The captured Iraqi tank now resides outside of the headquarters of Alpha Company.

He was {{national}} K-2 200 m champion as an eighteen-year-old in 1997 (with partner Marko Petrović), The following year he became the father of twins. With a young family to support and no grants on offer for paddlers outside the national squad, Djenadić started working full-time at a petrol station in Šabac. He continued paddling at club level but in 2000 he decided he could no longer combine work and training. In 2003 however he took up canoeing again, at first on a semi-recreational basis but soon found he was training seriously again. In 2004 he came fourth in the K1 200m for his club KK Zorka-Boje at the Serbian club championships. In 2005 {{he was a member of}} the Zorka-Boje crew which won the K4 500m final. But it was his second place in the K1 200m which finally brought him to the national team selectors' notice. 2006 proved to be an extraordinary year for Djenadić. Now at last a member of the national squad, he was still working at the petrol station but was now eligible for a €2,000 <b>training</b> <b>allowance.</b> Djenadić and Bora Sibinkić were chosen to join up with reigning K-2 200 m world champions Ognjen Filipović and Dragan Zorić to form a new specialist K-4 200 m crew.
