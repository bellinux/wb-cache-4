It descended as before through the arc, and then, by <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> {{acquired}} in moving so far, it was propelled beyond the lowest point, and ascended in another curve, upon the other side, similar to the first. When the force was expended, it came back again; and thus it swung to and fro, several times, and at length came almost {{to a state of}} rest.|$|E

When the atom of hydrogen draws the atom of chlorine towards it to form the perfected molecule of hydrochloric acid, <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> exerts may be intrinsically similar to that which draws me to you. Attraction and repulsion appear to be the primary forces. This is attraction." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is exactly}} the same with politics. Our {{political}} vagueness divides men, it does not fuse them. Men will walk along the edge of a chasm in clear weather, but they will edge miles away from it in a fog. So a Tory can walk up to the very edge of Socialism, if he knows what is Socialism. But if he is told that Socialism is a spirit, a sublime atmosphere, a noble, indefinable tendency, why, then he keeps out of its way; and quite right too. One can meet an assertion with argument; but healthy bigotry is the only way in which one can meet a tendency. I am told that the Japanese method of wrestling consists not of suddenly pressing, but of suddenly giving way. This is one of my many reasons for disliking the Japanese civilization. To use surrender as a weapon is the very worst spirit of the East. But certainly there is no force so hard to fight as <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> is easy to conquer; the force that always yields and then returns. Such is the force of a great impersonal prejudice, such as possesses the modern world on so many points. Against this there is no weapon at all except a rigid and steely sanity, a resolution not to listen to fads, and not to be infected by diseases.|$|E
60|$|CATASTROPHISM {{has insisted}} upon the {{existence}} of a practically unlimited bank of <b>force,</b> on <b>which</b> <b>the</b> theorist might draw; and it has cherished the idea of the development of the earth from a state in which its form, and <b>the</b> <b>forces</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> exerted, were very different from those we now know. That such difference of form and power once existed is a necessary part of the doctrine of evolution.|$|R

Results are presented in form of temporal variation of pressure, movement of fluid gravity centre, forces and moments on the structure...|$|R
