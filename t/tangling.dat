5|$|McDowell's {{original}} {{script is}} far less comedic and much darker; the Maitlands' car crash is depicted graphically, with Barbara's arm being crushed and the couple screaming for help as they slowly drown in the river. A reference to this remained in all versions of the script, as Barbara remarks that her arm feels cold upon returning home as a ghost. Instead of possessing the Deetzes and forcing them to dance during dinner, the Maitlands cause a vine-patterned carpet to come to life and attack the Deetzes by <b>tangling</b> them to their chairs.|$|E
5|$|Manta {{rays are}} subject to other {{anthropogenic}} threats. Because mantas must swim constantly to flush oxygen-rich water over their gills, they are vulnerable to entanglement and subsequent suffocation. Mantas cannot swim backwards and, because of their protruding cephalic fins, are prone to entanglement in fishing lines, nets, and even loose mooring lines. When snared, mantas often attempt to free themselves by somersaulting, <b>tangling</b> themselves further. Loose, trailing line can wrap around and cut its way into its flesh, resulting in irreversible injury. Similarly, mantas become entangled in gill nets designed for smaller fish. Some mantas are injured by collision with boats, especially in areas where they congregate and are easily observed. Other threats or factors that may affect manta numbers are climate change, tourism, pollution from oil spills, and the ingestion of microplastics.|$|E
5|$|On 25 February 2012, in a {{match against}} Wigan Athletic, Bent landed awkwardly on his ankle after <b>tangling</b> with Antolín Alcaraz. He was stretchered off the pitch {{with what was}} thought to be a serious injury. This was later {{confirmed}} two days later, after Bent had a scan on his ankle that revealed he had ruptured ligaments. He was out for three months which effectively ended his season with Villa and most likely his chance to play at UEFA Euro 2012. Bent had recovered from his injury by mid-May and was in contention for Villa's final match of 2011–12 against Norwich City but was ultimately left out. This also gave him the possibility of making new England manager Roy Hodgson's Euro 2012 England squad. Bent vowed to prove his fitness to Hodgson, in the hope he would be selected to play in the tournament. Bent once again finished as Villa's top scorer with 10 goals in 25 appearances and vowed to stay on at the club.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 July the {{combined}} French and Spanish squadron put to sea, followed closely by the British squadron. Both sides took {{most of the day}} to assemble, hampered by light winds and damaged warships, but at 19:00 Moreno gave orders for his squadron to make all sail westwards towards the open ocean and Cadiz. Saumarez followed, but at 20:40, with night drawing in and the wind picking up, he instructed Keats to take Superb, the fastest ship in his squadron, ahead and engage the rearguard of Moreno's force. At 23:20, Keats discovered the Real Carlos and pulled alongside, firing three broadsides into the Spanish ship that started a severe fire. Superb then pushed on towards Saint Antoine while Real Carlos drifted in darkness and confusion, encountering San Hermenegildo, the Spanish ships mistaking one another for an enemy and opening fire. Real Carlos then drifted into San Hermenegildo, the huge ships <b>tangling</b> together and the fire spreading from one to another until both were blazing wrecks in the darkness. They both exploded at 00:15 on 13 July, killing more than 1,700 men. At some stage during the night, the independently sailing Spanish frigate Perla sailed through the battle and was fatally damaged in the crossfire, sinking the next morning.|$|E

25|$|The {{remainder}} of Snuka's initial WWF stint {{would see him}} frequently <b>tangling</b> with Piper one way or another, often via tag matches or wrestling Piper's closest ally, Bob Orton, Jr. Snuka defeated Orton at The War to Settle the Score on February 18, 1985; an injury during the match forced Orton to wear a cast on his left arm, which he continued to wear after the injury healed. The feud played a small part in the first ever WrestleMania in March 1985, when Snuka acted as a cornerman for Hulk Hogan and Mr. T when they defeated Piper and Paul Orndorff (with Orton in their corner). Snuka left the WWF in July 1985, though he still appeared in cartoon form when Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling premiered in September.|$|E
40|$|This paper gives two new {{combinatorial}} topological proofs of {{the classification}} of rational <b>tangles.</b> Each proof rests on an elegant lemma showing that rational <b>tangles</b> are isotopic to canonical alternating rational <b>tangles.</b> The first proof defines the <b>tangle</b> fraction from the canonical form and uses flyping to prove invariance.

40|$|A <b>tangle</b> {{is a pair}} (B, T), where B is a 3 -ball, T {{is a pair of}} {{properly}} embedded arcs. When {{there is}} no ambiguity we will simply say that T is a <b>tangle.</b> Let E(T) = B − IntN(T) be the exterior of T, usually called the <b>tangle</b> space. T is simple if E(T) is a simple manifold, that is, it is irreducible, ∂-irreducible, atoroidal, and anannular. By Thurston’s geometrization theorem, simple <b>tangle</b> spaces admit hyperbolic structures with totally geodesic boundary. When embedding the <b>tangle</b> space into S 3 in the natural way, the complement is a handlebody of genus two. Hence, detecting simple <b>tangles</b> is the same as detecting embedded genus two handlebodies with simple complement. In general, {{it is difficult to determine}} if a <b>tangle</b> is simple. The first simple <b>tangle</b> (see Figure 1. 5 (a)) was suggested by Jaco [7, P 194], and was verified by Myers [8] with a rather lengthy argument. Due to the nature of the problem, such kind of argument seems unavoidable before a general theory of detecting simple <b>tangles</b> is developed. A similar <b>tangle</b> is the one in Figure 1. 5 (b), which was proved simple by Ruberman [10]. Another simple <b>tangle</b> is the one in Figure 1. 6. Its <b>tangle</b> space was called the tripos manifold, and was proved to be hyperbolic by Thurston [12, Chapter 3]. These have been used by Adam...|$|R

25|$|Tackle design {{began to}} improve from the 1880s. The {{introduction}} of new woods to the manufacture of fly rods {{made it possible to}} cast flies into the wind on silk lines, instead of horse hair. These lines allowed for a much greater casting distance. However, these early fly lines proved troublesome as they had to be coated with various dressings to make them float and needed to be taken off the reel and dried every four hours or so to prevent them from becoming waterlogged. Another negative consequence was that it became easy for the much longer line to get into a tangle - this was called a 'tangle' in Britain, and a 'backlash' in the US. This problem spurred the invention of the regulator to evenly spool the line out and prevent <b>tangling.</b>|$|E
25|$|In early August, Banks' corps, {{now part}} of Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia, was {{stationed}} at Culpeper, Virginia. With reports of Jackson's Confederate troops marching in their direction, the 46th {{and the rest of}} their brigade under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford were ordered to attack them near a promontory named Cedar Mountain. Advancing across a wheat field, Crawford's brigade smashed into the left of Jackson's line and collapsed elements of two brigades there, including the vaunted Stonewall Brigade. During the confusion of battle, the 46th split in two directions, with the right half engaging the right flank of the Stonewall Brigade, and the left half <b>tangling</b> with the left end of Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett's brigade. The fighting here was close and savage, including hand-to-hand combat. However, with no Union reinforcements immediately sent to sustain this breakthrough, and with pressure from additional Rebel troops sent to shore up and rally this end of the line, Crawford's men were soon outflanked and forced to retreat back across the wheat field.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of Bukhara, Genghis headed to the Khwarezmian capital of Samarkand and arrived in March 1220. During this period, the Mongols also waged {{effective}} psychological warfare and caused divisions within their foe. The Khan's spies told him of the bitter fighting between the Shah and his mother, who commanded the allegiance {{of some of his}} most senior commanders and his elite Turkish cavalry divisions. Since Mongols and Turks are both steppe peoples, Genghis argued that Tertun Khatun and her army should join the Mongols against her treacherous son. Meanwhile, he arranged for deserters to bring letters that said Tertun Khatun and some of her generals had allied with the Mongols. This further inflamed the existing divisions in the Khwarezm Empire, and probably prevented the senior commanders from unifying their forces. Genghis then compounded the damage by repeatedly issuing bogus decrees in the name of either Tertun Khatun or Shah Mohammed, further <b>tangling</b> up the already divided Khwarezm command structure. As a result of the Mongol strategic initiative, speedy maneuvers, and psychological strategies, all the Khwarezm generals, including the Queen Mother, kept their forces as a garrison and were defeated in turn.|$|E
50|$|The key {{technical}} value of <b>tangles</b> and string links {{is that they}} have algebraic structure. Isotopy classes of <b>tangles</b> form a tensor category, where for the category structure, one can compose two <b>tangles</b> if the bottom end of one equals the top end of the other (so the boundaries can be stitched together), by stacking them - they do not literally form a category (pointwise) because there is no identity, since even a trivial <b>tangle</b> takes up vertical space, but up to isotopy they do. The tensor structure is given by juxtaposition of <b>tangles</b> - putting one <b>tangle</b> {{to the right of the}} other.|$|R

25|$|Prost {{took the}} 1989 world title after a {{collision}} with Senna at the Suzuka Circuit in Japan, the penultimate race of the season, which Senna needed to win to remain in contention for the title. Prost had managed to leave the grid faster than Senna by removing the gurney flap from his car, which was unbeknownst to Senna. This reduction in aerodynamic downforce made Prost's car faster on the straights, but slower through corners- a clever choice to make it even harder for Senna to pass on a circuit already difficult on which to pass. On lap 46, Senna had finally come next to Prost and attempted a pass on the inside at the last chicane. Prost turned right into the upcoming corner, cutting Senna off and <b>tangling</b> wheels with him. The collision caused both McLarens to slide to a standstill into the escape road ahead. Prost abandoned the race at that point, whereas Senna urged marshals for a push-start, which he received, then proceeding with the race after a pit stop to replace the damaged nose on his car. He took the lead from the Benetton of Alessandro Nannini {{and went on to}} claim victory, only to be disqualified following a stewards meeting after the race. Senna was disqualified for receiving a push start, cutting the chicane after the collision with Prost, and for crossing into the pit lane entry which {{was not part of the}} track. A large fine and temporary suspension of his FIA Super License followed in the winter of 1989, and an irate Senna engaged in a bitter war of words with the FIA and its then-president, Jean-Marie Balestre, whom he blamed for his disqualification in Japan. Senna claimed that Balestre had forced the race stewards to disqualify him so his fellow Frenchman Prost could win the championship, though the stewards of the meeting denied that Balestre forced their decision, claiming that he was not present when the decision was made. Senna finished the season second with six wins and one second place. Prost left McLaren for rivals Ferrari for the following year.|$|E
