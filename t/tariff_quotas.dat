40|$|Although many {{countries}} have adopted freer trade regimes {{or are in}} the pro-cess of reforming quantitative restrictions, such reforms are not without short-term costs. Sudden removal of quantitative restrictions can release a surge of demand for imports that can deplete foreign exchange reserves and force rapid adjustment by domestic industries. Five methods to more gradually liberalize quantitative restrictions are discussed: raising quota ceilings until they are non-binding; eliminating quotas product by product; converting quotas to equiva-lent tariffs and then reducing them; auctioning quota licenses; and converting quotas to <b>tariff</b> <b>quotas,</b> and then liberalizing these. The various instruments are evaluated according to their implications for the adjustment period, for gov-ernment revenue, for the balance of payments, and for {{the extent to which}} they are likely to produce political disruptions. M any developing countries have resorted to trade restrictions to limit imports as a whole, to ration scarce foreign exchange (limiting it to payments for essential imports), or to protect particular domestic in-dustries as part of a development program. Countries have used a seemingly baffling variety of policy instruments that have constrained and distorted trade: lists of banned imports, tariffs, surcharges, stamp fees, prior import de-posits, import quotas, <b>tariff</b> <b>quotas,</b> discretionary import licensing, foreign ex-change controls, multiple exchange rates, and local content requirements.

Estonia has followed radical macroeconomic reforms in the 1990 ’s and is well known by its extremely liberal trade policy including the complete absence of tariffs and quantitative restrictions. Therefore the accession to the EU means for Estonia radical change in the trade policy regime. The most affected will be trade with food products and eventually this will cause deep changes in the Estonian agriculture. Estonia has to implement EU common external tariffs against third countries and on the other hand EU food market will be opened to Estonian exporters.

40|$|The use of tariff-rate quotas as a {{protectionist}} device has not {{yet been}} quite well understood. There is a widespread understanding that the offer of an additional tariff quota will generate a growth in the volume exported equivalent to the extra amount yielded. However, this may not happen, due to the characteristics of the tariff-quota system. Given the demand curve for a certain product, only one of the three components of the tariff-quota mechanism is determinant in restraining imports: the volume of the quota, the in-quota or the extra-quota. In addition, the estimate of gains in the value exported must include the increase in the ?quota-rent? allowed by the additional quota. This paper aims to point out the importance of an accurate assessment of the effects of additional <b>tariff</b> <b>quotas</b> for some Brazilian agricultural exports. The study focuses on the case of the offer made by the European Union in the negotiations for a Mercosur-EU free trade agreement. ...|$|E
40|$|Differences {{regarding}} the liberalisation of agricultural markets are {{a central issue}} in the current Doha Round of WTO negotiations. The positions of the individual countries and country groups differ significantly as far as market access is concerned. The positions {{can be explained by}} the existing levels of market support and thus by potential agricultural income losses as a consequence of market liberalisation. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the dynamic impacts of different adjustment steps in endogenous development trends of markets and of exogenous market access and the resulting interactions between the agricultural markets. Adjustment steps of market access can consist of an expansion of <b>tariff</b> <b>quotas</b> and in a reduction of import tariffs. Our simulations show that price development and thus the development of the revenue from agricultural products depend on several factors. In addition to domestic supply and demand the temporal design of market liberalisation is a key influencing factor.

Rules to determine a country of origin, or "nationality" of a country of production of goods, are called "rules of origin.

40|$|The report {{examines}} EU’s tariff regime for {{seafood and}} its implications for Norway’s exports to the EU. If Norway had no tariff preferences in the EU market, her seafood exports would be charged tariffs at 1. 3 billion NOK or 6 % of the trade value. Tariff preferences under the Norway-EU free trade agreements cut tariffs by around half, and <b>tariff</b> <b>quotas</b> imply a further reduction to 0. 4 billion or 1. 84 % of the trade value. However, most other suppliers to the EU market have tariff preferences that are as good or even better. For Norway, WTO liberalisation will reduce tariffs for its seafood exports to the EU and provide a clear overall gain. EU membership will nevertheless eliminate tariffs altogether, and might have an impact on import demand that is 15 times larger than what is expected from the current WTO round.

40|$|The Swiss {{agriculture}} {{is considered to}} be one of the more subsidized in the world. Using an applied general equilibrium model, we study the effects of two reforms of the agricultural policy on the welfare of various categories of households. Our framework of analysis allows to take into account the high number of agricultural policy instruments set up by the government. The analysis of the reform AP 2002 shows that, in spite of almost non-existent aggregate welfare gains, great disparities appear between the various households considered. The farmers are by far the losers whereas the pensioners and the wealthy employees profit largely from the reform. With regard to project AP 2007, the effect of an auction of the <b>tariff</b> <b>quotas</b> is positive for most of the households in the sense that it increases their welfare gains compared to the reform AP 2002.
