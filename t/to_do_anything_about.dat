5|$|In 1952, Hornsby {{was again}} hired {{to manage the}} St. Louis Browns, his first major league job in 16 years. The Browns' owner, Bill Veeck, {{was the son of}} former Cubs {{president}} and general manager William Veeck, Sr. Hornsby was not well received by the players, however. On June9, he was fired due to a disagreement with Veeck over an incident against the Yankees the day before. During the game, a fan prevented Gil McDougald of the Yankees from catching a fly ball, and the umpire ruled that it was fan interference. Hornsby did not initially argue the call, and a few minutes later Veeck forced him to do it (when {{it was already too late}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it). This led to Hornsby and the Browns parting ways. The Browns players were so happy about Hornsby's firing that they gave Veeck an engraved trophy to thank him.|$|E
5|$|The December 1964 South Vietnamese coup {{took place}} before dawn on December 19, 1964, when the ruling {{military}} junta of South Vietnam led by General Nguyễn Khánh dissolved the High National Council (HNC) and arrested {{some of its}} members. The HNC was an unelected legislative-style civilian advisory body they had created {{at the request of}} the United States—South Vietnam's main sponsor—to give a veneer of civilian rule. The dissolution dismayed the Americans, particularly the ambassador, Maxwell D. Taylor, who engaged in an angry war of words with various generals including Khánh and threatened aid cuts. They were unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the fait accompli that had been handed to them, because they strongly desired to win the Vietnam War and needed to support the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Instead, Taylor's searing verbal attacks were counterproductive as they galvanized the Vietnamese officers around the embattled Khánh. At the time, Khánh's leadership was under threat from his fellow generals, as well as Taylor, who had fallen out with him and was seeking his removal.|$|E

5|$|When Sickles {{arrived with}} his III Corps, General Meade {{instructed}} {{him to take}} up a position on Cemetery Ridge that linked up with the II Corps on his right and anchored his left on Little Round Top. Sickles originally did so, but after noon he became concerned about a slightly higher piece of ground 0.7 miles (1,100 m) to his front, a peach orchard owned by the Sherfy family. He undoubtedly recalled the debacle at Chancellorsville, where the high ground ("Hazel Grove") he was forced to give up was used against him as a deadly Confederate artillery platform. Acting without authorization from Meade, Sickles marched his corps to occupy the peach orchard. This had two significant negative consequences: his position now took the form of a salient, which could be attacked from multiple sides; and he was forced to occupy lines that were much longer than his two-division corps could defend. Meade was furious about this insubordination, {{but it was too late}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> itthe Confederate attack was imminent.|$|E
5|$|Although Poniatowski {{protested the}} First Partition of the Commonwealth (1772), he was {{powerless}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it. He considered abdication, but decided against it. During the Partition Sejm of 1773–1775, in which Russia {{was represented by}} ambassador Otto von Stackelberg, with no help forthcoming from abroad and the armies of the partitioning powers occupying Warsaw to compel the Sejm by force of arms, no alternative was available save submission to their will. Eventually Poniatowski and the Sejm acceded to the partition treaty; at the same time, several other reforms were passed. The Cardinal Laws were confirmed and guaranteed by the partitioning powers. Royal power was restricted, as the king lost the power to give out titles, and positions of military officers, ministers and senators, the starostwo territories, and Crown lands would be awarded through an auction. The Sejm also created two notable institutions: the Permanent Council, a main governmental body in continuous operation, and the Commission of National Education. The partitioners intended the Council to be easier to control than the unruly Sejms, and indeed it remained {{under the influence of}} the Russian Empire. Nevertheless, it was a significant improvement in the Commonwealth governance. The new legislation was guaranteed by the Russian Empire, giving it another excuse to interfere in Commonwealth politics if the legislation it favored was changed.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E

The Christian community accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government under B. S. Yeddyurappa {{of involvement in the}} attacks and backing the anti-Christian campaigns. In response to the report that the police had information, Fr. Henry Sequeira, chancellor of the Mangalore Diocese said, [...] "If the police knew about this in advance and still could not prevent the attacks, then we have no hope." [...] However, Superintendent Kumar had made security arrangements near the New Life Prayer Centre in Kankanady and had successfully barred the miscreants from entering and vandalising the centre at that particular location, leading to a violent conflict with the police. The police were also criticised by Christians for using excessive force in suppressing the protests and aggressively subduing Christian protesters whilst failing to punish the offending Hindu nationalist perpetrators; photographs and video footage has emerged of the beating of some of the protestors with canes. Caning by the police was also reported at Panemangalore and Farangipet.|$|E

It's a little bit different for us. It doesn't really have a paranormal aspect, except for Scully's perceptions of her deepest fears.

500|$|In 1821, Minh Mạng {{sent two}} of his aides from central Vietnam to serve as {{education}} officials in the south. One of the objectives was that they would oversee the imperial examination process and education system, which {{would allow them to}} determine who would serve in the government as mandarins and therefore fill the southern ranks with men acceptable to the court. However, their attempts were either blocked or circumvented by Duyệt's incumbent officials and they returned to the capital two years later in failure. In 1823, one of Duyệt's closest subordinates Tran Nhat Vinh, was indicted by one of Minh Mạng's officials from Huế, who charged him with trading rice on the black market and operating a brothel. Duyệt put a stop to the legal proceedings and angrily tried to turn the tables, calling on the emperor to execute the accusing official. This ended in a stalemate, but a few years later, Vinh was transferred to northern Vietnam and later imprisoned while Duyet was unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the matter in the south; Vinh's position was taken by one of the emperor's men. In 1826, Duyệt resisted the removal of a regional official by the palace, leading the emperor to criticise him in a proclamation declaring that court appointments came under the purview of Huế. The following year, Duyệt executed convicted criminals without informing the capital, leading the emperor to criticise him again, saying that [...] "the ultimate authority to decide questions of life and death belongs to the court." ...|$|E

In 2006, Rangers were charged by UEFA for discriminatory chanting over the singing of [...] "Billy Boys" [...] during a UEFA Champions League game against Villarreal.
