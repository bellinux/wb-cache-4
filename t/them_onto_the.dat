5|$|Donald Cousens Parkway is {{intended}} to relieve north-south traffic congestion on York Regional Road68 (Main Street, former Highway48) and York Regional Road69 (Ninth Line), with signage suggesting drivers use the parkway as a through route past Markham. As trucks are prohibited along Main Street, signage guides <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> parkway.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Hawaii, {{fishermen}} occasionally hunted dolphins {{for their}} meat by driving <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> beach and killing them. In their ancient legal system, dolphin meat {{was considered to}} be kapu (forbidden) for women together with several other kinds of food. Today, dolphin drive hunting no longer takes place in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Although Paisley was now {{in charge}} of the Liverpool team, Bill Shankly was asked to lead <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> pitch for the last time. Brian Clough later claimed that he wanted Don Revie {{to do the same for}} Leeds but Revie, who watched the match from a seat in the stand, {{declined}} the offer. A curiosity of the match was that Liverpool had no number 10 shirt and Leeds had no number 11. Phil Boersma and Eddie Gray both wore number 12.|$|E
50|$|In the 2007 Scottish {{parliamentary}} election the Scottish National Party proposed a £2,000 grant for first-time buyers to help <b>them</b> get <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> property ladder.|$|R

5|$|On {{or around}} July 7, King Edward III crossed the English Channel to Normandy with 1,600 ships. He took the ports of La Hogue and Barfleur with {{overwhelming}} force and continued inland towards Caen, taking towns along the way. The French mounted a defence at Caen, but were ultimately defeated. The French {{had been planning}} to cross the channel and invade England with a force of about 14,000 led by Jean le Franc, but Edward's attack forced <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> defensive.|$|E
5|$|All {{the crew}} {{on board the}} ship {{at the time of}} the {{incident}} (41 in total) are believed to have died, although not all the bodies were found. In addition, one visitor to the ship (an officer's wife) and eight terminal workers were killed. Initial efforts to contain the fire were hampered by a lack of organization and poorly maintained fire-fighting equipment at the terminal. The Bantry fire brigade spent some time waiting at the town pier for a launch to take <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> island. The terminal's own fire engine would not start. Firefighters had to break into the terminal's main depot to access materials and equipment (much of which did not work).|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began at}} about 8 a.m. {{with the first}} allied lines attacking the village of Telnitz, which was defended by the 3rd Line Regiment. This sector of the {{battlefield}} witnessed heavy fighting in this early action as several ferocious Allied charges evicted the French from the town and forced <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> {{other side of the}} Goldbach. The first men of Davout's corps arrived at this time and threw the Allies out of Telnitz before they too were attacked by hussars and re-abandoned the town. Additional Allied attacks out of Telnitz were checked by French artillery.|$|E

30|$|Hence, {{instead of}} putting an {{approximate}} algebraic or numeric constraint on the Euclidean space R^N and projecting <b>them</b> back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> SO(3) manifold, an unconstrained optimization on the manifold is a natural generalization {{and is expected to}} perform better.|$|R
5|$|Takumi {{learns that}} he is an artificial, {{delusional}} clone with fabricated memories, created by Shogun – the real Takumi. His sister Nanami is being held in the location of the real Noah II, where she is made to awaken as a gigalomaniac and obtain a Di-Sword. Rimi – also a gigalomaniac – tries to save her, but is attacked by Norose and is taken prisoner in Nanami's stead. Shogun again meets with Takumi to tell him that he had intended to stop Nozomi from taking over humanity with Noah II, but that his body – aged from disease and overuse of gigalomaniac powers – hindered him, prompting him to create Takumi to do it in his stead. Takumi obtains a Di-Sword, and destroys the transmitters, revealing the nurse Hazuki to be the New Gen killer in the process by reading her memories and projecting <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> screens on the buildings. An earthquake occurs, destroying much of Shibuya; Takumi rescues the other gigalomaniacs from the destruction, and continues to the location of Noah II. He fights Norose, but Noah II activates its self-defense mode, overwhelming Takumi with delusions; he reaffirms his existence, and destroys Norose and Noah II with his Di-Sword. As he lies in the ruins of Shibuya, depending on what delusions the player has chosen, he either gives up his life along with the dying Shogun's, or stays alive with Rimi.|$|E
25|$|On 13 June 2014, the Montford Point {{successfully}} completed LCAC interface tests {{off the coast}} of Camp Pendleton. LCACs moved Amphibious Assault Vehicles from the base and offloaded <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ship, demonstrating the ESD's ability to facilitate at-sea transfers to serve as a mobile seabase.|$|E
25|$|With an {{operational}} system now online, tactical considerations were developed. The first was airborne radar sets, installed on fighters. German pilots complained {{about this as}} it created drag and reduced {{the performance of their}} aircraft. They preferred to acquire the target visually once ground control had guided <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> bomber stream. A second change involved the removal of AAA installations and searchlights from the line and grouping them around cities for their defence.|$|E
50|$|Theoretically, it is {{possible}} to project <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> an n-sphere. <b>The</b> projection <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> circle results in the aforementioned Radar chart. This could prove to be a powerful computer-aided multivariable visualization method if, upon projection <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> common tridimensional sphere, the layers are given some degree of transparency on their alpha channel so as to allow to see through.|$|R
50|$|When necessary, {{local road}} traffic {{authorities}} {{can put up}} signs at congestion points labelling these routes as traffic diversion routes. The emergency diversion route will guide road users around the incident along an alternative road and bring <b>them</b> back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> motorway or main road at a later junction.|$|R

25|$|On modern artwork, dots are {{generally}} applied with bamboo satay sticks. The larger flat end of bamboo satay sticks are {{more commonly used}} for single application of dots to paintings, but the sharp pointier end is used to create fine dots. To create superimposed dotting, artists may take a bunch of satay sticks, dip the pointy ends into the paint and then transfer <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> canvas in quick successions of dotting.|$|E
25|$|In this story, an artist, named Niggle, {{lives in}} a society that does not much value art. Working only to please himself, he paints a canvas of a great Tree with a forest in the distance. He invests each and every leaf of his tree with obsessive {{attention}} to detail, making every leaf uniquely beautiful. Niggle ends up discarding all his other artworks, or tacks <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> main canvas, which becomes a single vast embodiment of his vision.|$|E
25|$|After {{doing his}} normal pre-jump show {{and a few}} warm up approaches, Knievel began his real approach. When he hit the takeoff ramp, he felt the {{motorcycle}} unexpectedly decelerate. The sudden loss of power on the takeoff caused Knievel to come up short and land on the safety ramp which {{was supported by a}} van. This caused the handlebars to be ripped out of his hands as he tumbled over <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> pavement where he skidded into the Dunes parking lot.|$|E
50|$|As {{settlement}} sped {{up across}} the West after the transcontinental railroad was completed, clashes with Native Americans of the Plains and southwest reached a final phase. The military's mission was to clear the land of free-roaming Indians and put <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> reservations. <b>The</b> stiff resistance after the Civil War of battle-hardened, well-armed Indian warriors resulted in the Indian Wars.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} streams flowing on the {{perimeter}} of the dunes. The streams erode the edge of the dune field, and sand is carried downstream. The water disappears into the ground, depositing sand on the surface. Winds pick up the deposits of sand, and blow <b>them</b> up <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> dune field once again.|$|R
60|$|She {{threw the}} bomb. It sailed in an arc, an expert, rolling and {{bouncing}} {{to the entrance}} of the bunker. Two Wounded Soldiers stood uncertainly by the brick pile. More Davids poured from behind <b>them,</b> out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> plain. One of the Wounded Soldiers moved toward the bomb, stooping awkwardly down to pick it up.|$|R
25|$|The crane {{is driven}} by an {{operator}} who sits in a cabin suspended from the trolley. The trolley runs along rails located on the top or sides of the boom and girder. The operator runs the trolley over the ship to lift the cargo, usually containers. Once the spreader locks onto the container, the container is lifted, moved over the dock, and placed on a truck chassis (trailer) {{to be taken to}} the storage yard. The crane also lifts containers from chassis on the dock to load <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ship.|$|E
25|$|During the winter, belugas {{commonly}} become {{trapped in}} the ice {{without being able to}} escape to open water, which may be several kilometres away. Polar bears take particular advantage of these situations and are able to locate the belugas using their sense of smell. The bears swipe at the belugas and drag <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ice to eat them. They are able to capture large individuals in this way; in one documented incident, a bear weighing between 150 and 180kg was able to capture an animal that weighed 935kg.|$|E
25|$|During the Santa Ana winds, large ocean waves can develop. These waves {{come from}} a northeasterly direction; toward the {{normally}} sheltered side of Catalina Island. Protected harbors such as Avalon and Two Harbors are normally sheltered and the waters within the harbors are very calm. In strong Santa Ana conditions, these harbors develop high surf and strong winds that can tear boats from their moorings and crash <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> shore. During a Santa Ana, it is advised that boaters moor {{on the back side}} of the island to avoid the dangerous conditions of the front side.|$|E
60|$|We had the {{carriage}} to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes {{had brought with}} him. Among these he rummaged and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed <b>them</b> up <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> rack.|$|R

One of <b>them</b> slid <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> {{concourse}} to the right of the engine, coming to rest almost abreast of it. The other nosed downward behind the engine into the gigantic hole in the concourse floor. Six more coach cars jumped the tracks behind the train.|$|R

25|$|The Azov Cossacks {{also helped}} to {{intercept}} numerous English, French and Turkish contraband supplies, and in 1835 {{off the coast}} of Novorossiysk they destroyed two Schooners and later captured the English cargo ship Vixen which carried a whole arsenal of illegal rifles. However, despite the success in 1839 Imam Shamil sent his naib Magomet-Amin who instead of rallying the Circassians on the northern Kuban approach, unleashed <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> Black Sea line in 1840. Outnumbered and after several Russian forts and garrisons were overrun, it was decided to abandon the Black Sea Coast and the Azov Cossacks proved their importance in evacuating the surviving Russian units.|$|E
25|$|Drover leads {{a team of}} {{six other}} riders, {{including}} Lady Sarah, Drover's Aboriginal brother-in-law Magarri, Nullah, and the station's accountant Kipling Flynn, to drive the 1,500 cattle to Darwin. They encounter various obstacles along the way, including a fire set by Carney's men that scares the cattle, resulting {{in the death of}} Flynn when the group tries to stop the cattle from stampeding over a cliff. Lady Sarah and Drover fall in love, and she gains a new appreciation for the Australian territory. The team drive the cattle through the dangerous Never Never desert. Then, when at last delivering the cattle in Darwin, the group has to race <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ship before Carney's cattle are loaded.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, {{the attack}} on the Anthill proceeds. Dax leads the first wave of {{soldiers}} over the top into no man's land under heavy fire. None of the men reach the German trenches, and B Company refuse to leave their own trench after sustaining heavy casualties. Mireau, enraged, orders his artillery to open fire on them to force <b>them</b> <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> battlefield. The artillery commander refuses to fire on his own men without written confirmation of the order. Meanwhile, Dax returns to the trenches, and tries to rally B Company to join the battle, but as he climbs out of the trench, the body of a dead French soldier knocks him down. Predictably, the attack was a failure.|$|E
