The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if there was a significant difference in the test scores of fifth grade, public school students, in Iowa, who are using Leonard Bernstein's Artful Learning Model compared to fifth grade students, located in a demographically similar school, who are not using the Artful Learning Model as measured by the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS). The data for this study was taken from the raw tests scores from the ITBS in the years 2005 - 2009 of all fifth graders located in the two, non-randomly selected public schools, located in a suburban school district in the State of Iowa. The population for this study included fifth grade students from a suburban school district. The data generating sample ranged between 142 to 179 fifth grade students spanning the school years from 2005 - 2009. Null hypotheses were tested for significance at the. 05 level. The non-parametic Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test were employed to analyze the data. The results of the study indicated that the Artful Learning Model had a significant impact on the reading vocabulary (2007 - 2008) and science (2006 - 2007 and 2008 - 2009) portions of the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. The experimental and control groups had, in general, similar score results except in <b>those</b> subjects <b>noted</b> <b>above</b> on the ITBS...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} firings of the A- 10 /GAU- 8 {{weapon system}} on 19 September 1979 against a Soviet tank company simulated by 10 combat loaded M- 47 tanks. The pilots making the firing passes attacked at low altitude and used correspondingly low dive angles {{in order to}} simulate movement through a hostile air defense system. Ammunition used in the attacks comprised Aerojet Lot Number AJD 79 A 181 - 001 30 mm armor piercing incendiary (API) rounds, which proved to be effective damage agents against substantial areas of the U. S M- 47 tanks used as targets. The pilots in ten successful firing passes expended a total of 1349 rounds of which 243 impacted the targets. Of the projectiles impacting on target, 42 achieved perforations of the armored envelope. The simulated soviet tank company was destroyed as a combat formation with seven tanks being totally immobilized immediately. One additional tank would have been immobilized immediately. One additional tank would have been immobilized after approximately 500 meters of further movement. Among <b>those</b> eight tanks <b>noted</b> <b>above</b> as immobilized, three suffered catastrophic damage from perforating projectile which penetrated into the fuel tanks and ignited diesel fuel.

2500|$|The {{temple of}} Seti I {{was built on}} entirely new ground half a mile {{to the south of}} the long series of temples just described. This {{surviving}} building is best known as the Great Temple of Abydos, being nearly complete and an impressive sight. A principal purpose of the temple was that of a memorial temple to the king Seti I, as well as reverence of the early pharaohs, which is incorporated within as part of the [...] "Rite of the Ancestors". The long list of the pharaohs of the principal dynasties—recognized by Seti—are carved on a wall and known as the [...] "Abydos King List" [...] (showing the cartouche name of many dynastic pharaohs of Egypt from the first, Narmer or Menes, until his time)- with the exception of <b>those</b> <b>noted</b> <b>above.</b> There were significant names deliberately left out of the list. So rare as an almost complete list of pharaoh names, the Table of Abydos, re-discovered by William John Bankes, has been called the [...] "Rosetta Stone" [...] of Egyptian archaeology, analogous to the Rosetta Stone for Egyptian writing, beyond the Narmer Palette.|$|E
6000|$|Representative {{forms of}} the same {{character}} as <b>those</b> <b>noted</b> <b>above</b> are found in all extensive continental areas, but they are rarely so numerous. Thus, in Mr. Elwes' paper on the [...] "Distribution of Asiatic Birds," [...] he states that 12.5 per cent. of the land birds of Burmah and Tenasserim are peculiar species, whereas we find that in Borneo they are about 25 per cent., and the difference may fairly be imputed to the greater proportion of slightly modified representative species due to a period of complete isolation. Of peculiar genera, the Indo-Chinese Peninsula has one--Ampeliceps, a remarkable yellow-crowned starling, with bare pink-coloured orbits; while two others, Temnurus and Crypsirhina--singular birds allied to the jays--are found in no {{other part of the}} Asiatic continent though they occur in some of the Malay Islands. Borneo has seven peculiar genera of passeres,[89] as well as Hæmatortyx, a crested partridge; and Lobiophasis, a pheasant hardly distinct from Euplocamus; while two others, Pityriasis, an extraordinary bare-headed bird between a jay and a shrike, and Carpococcyx, a pheasant-like ground cuckoo formerly thought to be peculiar, are said to have been discovered also in Sumatra.|$|E

50|$|St. Lawrence is a {{neighbourhood}} {{located in}} downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The area, a former industrial area, is bounded by Yonge, Front, and Parliament Streets, and the Canadian National railway embankment. The Esplanade off Yonge St., lined with restaurants, cafés and hotels {{runs through the}} middle of the area. In previous times, the area was sometimes referred to as 'St. Lawrence Ward' or more often today as 'St. Lawrence Market', synonymous with the large retail vendor market which is the neighbourhood's focal point. The area is the site of a large city-sponsored housing project of the 1970s, which revitalized an old 'brownfields' area. The boundaries of the St Lawrence Neighbourhood Association and the St Lawrence Market BIA are somewhat larger than <b>those</b> <b>noted</b> <b>above.</b> Both groups have boundaries that extend from Yonge to Parliament Streets and Queen Street East to the rail corridor.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} {{of many of}} the unincorporated entities has historically been transitory, and some have rarely if ever reported any population at all. The only ones that have reported population in each census since 1900 are Dixville Township, Millsfield Township and Wentworth’s Location (bearing in mind that Wentworth’s Location was an incorporated town for many years prior to the 1960s). All three appear to have small but well-established population bases. Wentworth’s Location has reported a {{population of}} at least 37 in every post-1900 census. Dixville and Millsfield have consistently been in double figures throughout the same period (the only exceptions being Millsfield in 1960 and 1980); in both communities, a town clerk's office exist for the purpose of conducting elections for state and federal officials. In addition to <b>those</b> <b>noted</b> <b>above,</b> Pinkham’s Grant reported population in every census from 1930 to 1990, although its population exceeded 17 in only one census, and it reported no population in 2000.|$|E
