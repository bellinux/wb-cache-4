[...] "We're going <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> make a statement, play a great game and show the nation", he said.

Clemson players viewed the game as a reward for a successful season, while Virginia Tech players perceived it from a more workmanlike point of view.|$|E

Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E
