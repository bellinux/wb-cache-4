Quiet, conservative people in Paris like to get to bed at three o'clock; after all, what is the use of keeping late hours and ruining one's health and complexion? If you make it a strict rule to be in bed by three, you feel all the better for it in the long run--health better, nerves steadier, eyes clearer--and you're able to get up early--at half-past eleven--and feel fine.|$|E

5000|$|A {{permanent}} saltwater barrier {{across the}} Neches River is located downstream of confluence of Pine Island Bayou and the Neches River within one-half mile of the confluence point. The barrier, constructed between 2000 and 2003, prevents saltwater contamination {{during periods of}} low river flows. The permanent saltwater barrier project had a budgeted cost of $50 million {{with the federal government}} paying 75% of the cost and the LNVA responsible for the remaining 25%. [...] The barrier, over 1,000 feet long, includes a 650 foot long overflow barrier; five forty-five foot wide tainter gates; and a fifty-six foot wide navigation lane regulated by <b>two</b> <b>thirty</b> foot sector gates. Temporary barriers were installed across Pine Island Bayou and the Neches River upstream of the confluence 36 times between 1940 and 2000 prior to construction of the permanent barrier.|$|E
50|$|One issue {{concerning}} anencephalic newborns is organ donation. Initial legal guidance {{came from}} the case of Baby Theresa in 1992, in which the boundaries of organ donation were tested for the first time. Infant organs are scarce, and the high demand for pediatric organ transplants poses a major public health issue. In 1999, {{it was found that}} among children who die under the age of <b>two,</b> <b>thirty</b> to fifty percent do so while awaiting transplant. In order for infant organs to be viable and used for transplant, they must be removed while the infant still has circulation or very soon after circulation has ceased. However, this poses both legal and ethical issues. In the United States, all states have laws that forbid the removal of organs from a donor until after the donor has died, except in the case of altruistic living donations of a kidney or liver segment.|$|E
5000|$|As Aunty Kay, {{she became}} a popular {{broadcaster}} on Radio Trinidad, hosting {{one of the most}} important shows for young people of the time, which ran for 43 years (1942-85) and [...] "featured mostly talented young people from the low-income areas who came every Sunday to display their singing talents.... It was a half-hour show which began at two o’clock in the afternoon and ended at <b>two</b> <b>thirty.</b> But, that half-hour was enough time for those talented children to get their fifteen minutes of community fame to show their various talents." [...] As Richard Bolai recalls, [...] "recitations, singing and oration was encouraged. What was particularly striking about the show was the theme song. One of Auntie Kay's signature items was her eloquence in grammar, this always struck me as ironic because the theme song was filled with slang." [...] The Aunty Kay Show provided an early platform for many of Trinidad and Tobago's performers to make their debut as youngsters, including Heather Headley, Lancelot Layne and calypsonian Slinger Francisco, better known as The Mighty Sparrow.|$|E

Predicted and measured propagation levels are compared in decibels (dB) relative to one of the measurement positions for receivers on the line passing between the <b>two</b> <b>thirty</b> meter towers. Agreement between predicted and measured levels is very good.
