Our methodology uses two types of calendar-time portfolios-one based on holdings and one based on <b>transactions.</b> <b>Portfolios</b> of local holdings do not generate abnormal performance (alphas are zero). When studying transactions, purchases of local stocks significantly underperform sales of local stocks. The underperformance remains when focusing on stocks with potentially high levels of information asymmetries. We conclude that individuals do not help incorporate information into stock prices. Our conclusions directly contradict existing studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{substantial}} {{adjustment cost}} for housing transactions affects a homeowner’s decision about when to move. It also affects her consumption of nondurables and her portfolio, at dates {{when a new}} house is purchased and over time intervals between moves. These decisions are studied using a calibrated dynamic model. For reasonable <b>transaction</b> costs, <b>portfolios</b> display substantial swings during intervals between moves and make large jumps when a new house is purchased. This suggests that a measure of housing wealth will be useful in empirical studies of portfolios at the micro level. The transaction cost has only a modest effect on nondurable consumption, however. Consequently, it can explain {{very little of the}} equity premium puzzle. These conclusions are robust to the value assumed for the elasticity of substitution between housing and nondurables, a parameter that over a broad range has a surprisingly weak impact on the consumer’s behavior...|$|R

40|$|Portfolio theory covers {{different}} approaches {{to the construction of}} a portfolio offering maximum expected returns for a given level of risk tolerance where the goal is to find the optimal investment rule. Each investor has a certain utility for money which is reflected by the choice of a utility function. In this article, a risk averse power utility function is studied in discrete time for a large class of underlying probability distribution of the returns of the asset prices. Each investor chooses, at the beginning of an investment period, the feasible portfolio allocation which maximizes the expected value of the utility function for terminal wealth. Effects of both large and small proportional transaction costs on the choice of an optimal portfolio are taken into account. The transaction regions are approximated by using asymptotic methods when the proportional transaction costs are small and by using expansions about critical points for large <b>transaction</b> costs. <b>Portfolio</b> optimization, <b>transaction</b> costs, dynamic programming, utility maximization,...|$|R

This method uses multivariate extreme value theory to minimize the probability of large portfolio losses. With more than 400 stocks to choose from, our study {{seems to be the}} first application of extreme value techniques in portfolio management on a large scale. The primary aim of our investigation is the potential of ERI in practice. The performance of this strategy is benchmarked against the minimum variance portfolio and the equally weighted portfolio. These fundamental strategies are important benchmarks for large-scale applications. Our comparison includes annualized portfolio returns, maximal drawdowns, <b>transaction</b> costs, <b>portfolio</b> concentration, and asset diversity in the portfolio. In addition to that we study the impact of an alternative tail index estimator. Our results show that the ERI strategy significantly outperforms both the minimum-variance portfolio and the equally weighted portfolio on assets with heavy tails.
