40|$|Abstract. Functional {{criteria}} often {{drive the}} component selection in the assem-bly of a software system. Minimal distance strategies are frequently adopted {{to select the}} components that require minimal adaptation effort. This type of approach hides to developers the non-functional characteristics of components, although they may {{play a crucial role}} to meet the system specifications. In this paper we introduce the CODER framework, based on an optimization model, that supports “build-or-buy ” decisions in selecting components. The selection crite-rion is based on cost minimization of the whole assembly subject to constraints on system reliability and delivery time. The CODER framework is composed by: an UML case tool, a model builder, and a model solver. The output of CODER indicates the components <b>to</b> buy and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> <b>build,</b> and <b>the</b> amount of testing to be performed on the latter in order to achieve the desired level of reliability. ...|$|R
