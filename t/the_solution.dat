5|$|The {{usefulness}} of inversion {{can be increased}} significantly by resizing. As noted in Viète's reconstruction, the three given circles and <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> circle can be resized in tandem while preserving their tangencies. Thus, the initial Apollonius problem is transformed into another problem that may be easier to solve. For example, the four circles can be resized so that one given circle is shrunk to a point; alternatively, two given circles can often be resized {{so that they are}} tangent to one another. Thirdly, given circles that intersect can be resized so that they become non-intersecting, after which the method for inverting to an annulus can be applied. In all such cases, <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> of the original Apollonius problem is obtained from <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> of the transformed problem by undoing the resizing and inversion.|$|E

5|$|To {{locate a}} second {{point on the}} lines L1, L2 and L3, Gergonne noted a {{reciprocal}} relationship between those lines and the radical axis R of <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> circles, CA and CB. To understand this reciprocal relationship, consider the two tangent lines to the circle C1 drawn at its tangent points A1 and B1 with <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> circles; the intersection of these tangent lines is the pole point of L1 in C1. Since the distances from that pole point to the tangent points A1 and B1 are equal, this pole point must also lie on the radical axis R of <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> circles, by definition (Figure9). The relationship between pole points and their polar lines is reciprocal; if the pole of L1 in C1 lies on R, the pole of R in C1 must conversely lie on L1. Thus, if we can construct R, we can find its pole P1 in C1, giving the needed second point on L1 (Figure10).|$|E
