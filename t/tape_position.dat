50|$|A Multitrack Turing {{machine is}} a {{specific}} type of Multi-tape Turing machine. In a standard n-tape Turing machine, n heads move independently along n tracks. In a n-track Turing machine, one head reads and writes on all tracks simultaneously. A <b>tape</b> <b>position</b> in a n-track Turing Machine contains n symbols from the tape alphabet. It is equivalent to the standard Turing machine and therefore accepts precisely the recursively enumerable languages.|$|E
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of the ATF system was that {{unlike in the}} case of a control track, an 8mm camera or player cannot keep track of where the tape is during fast forward and rewind (though it could during shuttle search). This made editing using a non linear editing system problematic. Some later cameras and players attempted to derive the <b>tape</b> <b>position</b> from the differential rotation of the spools with limited success.|$|E
50|$|On {{prerecorded}} tapes, {{the information}} about album artist, album title, and track titles and lengths is recorded in the auxiliary ninth track continuously {{for the length of}} the entire tape. This makes it possible for players to recognize immediately what the <b>tape</b> <b>position</b> is and how to get to any of the other tracks (including which side of the tape to turn to), as soon as a tape is inserted and playback is started, regardless of whether the tape was rewound before inserting or not.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} into the effect of patellar taping has found conflicting results and when studies have found positive findings these effects appear to be negated by exercise. The {{purpose of this study}} was to re-examine the effect of patellar <b>taping</b> on patellar <b>position</b> using ultrasound scanning. Twelve asymptomatic subjects (six males and six females (age 20. 4 +/− 1. 2 years)) had their patellar position examined, prior to and following the application of tape, and also following exercise (25 step ups). Mean patellar position (distance border patella to edge lateral femoral condyle) prior to application of tape was 6. 2 +/− 1. 3 mm following the application of <b>tape</b> mean patellar <b>position</b> was 7. 9 +/− 1. 7 mm, this was a statistically significant change in position (p= 0. 003). Following exercise mean patellar position was 7. 6 +/− 1. 7 mm this was a significant reduction compared to the <b>taped</b> <b>position</b> prior to exercise (p= 0. 001). This value was though still significantly greater than prior to the application of tape (p= 0. 006). This study found that patellar position was significantly changed following the application of tape. Furthermore, the study found that though low intensity exercise resulted in a significant change in the patellar position compared to the <b>taped</b> <b>position</b> prior to exercise, that change was most likely to have occurred due to random chance or measurement error...|$|R

50|$|Until early 2009, {{in spite}} of the decline of the cassette, logically {{operated}} deluxe models (WM-GX788 etc.) had been available in a very few countries, especially in South Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. These models supported a so-called gumstick-type rechargeable battery, offered relatively better sound quality than cheaper models did, and had an automatic <b>tape</b> <b>position</b> selector and auto-reverse function. As of spring 2009, all tape models except the WM-EX651 were discontinued in South Korea. In Japan, only a few cheap models (WM-GX202 etc.) remained. In October 2010, however, those 'few' models finally went out of production. Many people no longer use cassette tapes for music listening and, in a few countries, cassette tapes are only used for language learning, which is now significantly declining thanks to podcasts from BBC or CNN or trends of (foreign-language learning) publishers which adopt MP3 file services or attached CDs rather than attaching tapes to their publications.|$|E

It is characterised by a long halflife of 0. 39 (4) s [1], a high spin [2] and, although its dominant disintegration modes are β-delayed γ-ray [2] or proton [1] emission, the excitation energy of 6. 7 (5) MeV [3] makes direct one-proton and two-proton (2 p) radioactivity possible.

Twenty-one patients from the TOT group and 12 from the TVT group had ultrasonographic evaluation both at 1 and 2 years follow-up. <b>Tape</b> <b>position</b> was evaluated with a complete sagittal view, and {{the width of the}} tape and the distance between the middle of the tape and the bladder neck were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using a t test. After clinical evaluation, stress test, and uroflowmetry with residual measurement, the tapes were compared on ultrasound with regard to clinical and urodynamic results: success in stress incontinence vs failure, bladder outlet obstruction vs no obstruction, and de novo urgencies vs no urgencies. No difference was found between TOT and TVT in the midurethral tape placement. The distance between the middle of the tape and the bladder neck at rest was similar at both 1 and 2 years after both TOT and TVT and was unchanged after coughing or Valsalva. The width of the tape was similar after TOT and TVT at both 1 and 2 years after the procedure. There was no difference in the distance between the middle of the tape and the bladder neck between cured patients, failure, bladder outlet obstruction, and de novo urgencies after both TOT and TVT.

40|$|When a {{serpentine}} {{tape drive}} {{is used as}} a slow random access device, the I/O performance can be substantially improved by clever re-ordering of the I/O requests. This kind of re-ordering relies on a scheduling algorithm and a model of the access time. In this paper, we propose a low-cost access time model for serpentine tape drives, which is not a trivial task due to the complex data layout of serpentine tape. This model provides a way to estimate the physical <b>positions</b> on the <b>tape</b> for any logical data block, provides cost functions to estimate the seek time between two physical <b>tape</b> <b>positions,</b> and computes the transfer time of a data request. Our experiments show that the mapping from logical address to physical position has to be instrumented once for each tape cartridge. Algorithms are given to do this at a low cost. The accuracy of the model is assessed by measurements on tape drives and by use in scheduling of I/O requests. Experiments show that the model estimates are good enough to facilitate efficient scheduling of I/O requests. ...|$|R

[15] {{reported}} {{five patients}} with a diagnosis of SUI caused both by ISD (maximum urethral closure pressure < 20  cmH 2 O and Valsalva leak point < 65  cmH 2 O) and UH (cotton swab test > 30 °). Their five patients had persistent SUI after a primary TOT procedure. Postopertively, all patients with urodynamic testing still showed evidence of ISD and were treated successfully with repeat TVT without removal of the TOT sling from the prior procedure. Moore et al. [15] reported just five patients and concluded the TOT sling did not provide a large enough angle of support or enough urethral kinking to provide continence in patients with ISD. Therefore, a TVT sling was a viable option for a prior failed TOT [14]. Villet et el. [10] reported three patients with recurrent or persistent SUI after a prior TVT procedure. The position of the mesh from the first procedure was very loose in one patient, was not identified in a second patient, and was in a relatively good position and state of tension in the third patient. Tsivian et al. [16] reported that failures in 12 MUS procedures (TVT 9 cases, TOT 1 case, and IVS 2 cases) were {{at least in part}} because of a technical error (<b>tape</b> <b>position</b> too loose). They also reported that the problem of how tightly the sling should be placed beneath the urethra remained unresolved. This continues to be the long-standing “Achilles heel” of anti-incontinence surgery [16]. Paick et al.

40|$|AIMS: To {{assess the}} {{technical}} feasibility {{of a new}} mini-invasive sling procedure (MiniArc®) and present short-term results {{in the treatment of}} female urinary incontinence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 97 women with mixed or stress urinary incontinence (SUI) were treated by placement of the new single-incision sling. Pelvic organ prolapse was graded using the POP-Q system (pelvic organ prolapse quantification system). Preoperative workup included urodynamic evaluation, cough stress test and introital ultrasound. Postoperatively, introital ultrasound was performed to determine residual urine and check <b>tape</b> <b>position.</b> Quality of life was measured using King's Health Questionnaire. A voiding diary and pad count served to verify the patients' subjective complaints. RESULTS: The MiniArc® single-incision sling procedure was the initial intervention in 37 (38. 2 %) patients and the second intervention in 60 (61. 7 %) patients with recurrent incontinence. The cough stress test was negative in 79 (83. 1 %) women 6 weeks after the sling procedure and in 74 (77. 8 %) at 12 months. De novo urge occurred in 32 (36. 8 %) women. Quality of life was significantly improved at 12 -month follow-up in 65 (69. 1 %) patients (p < 0. 001). The number of pads decreased significantly from 2. 2 to 0. 6 (p < 0. 001) after the procedure. One patient developed an hematoma and bladder perforation occurred in another. CONCLUSIONS: Our short-term clinical results suggest that the MiniArc® is a safe and effective minimally invasive sling procedure for treating female SUI. Randomized comparative controlled trials and long-term results are still required to define the role of the new sling system in comparison to established mid-urethral tape techniques for treating incontinence...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} is to describe the outcomes after variations in tape placement while using the hanging manoeuver during a left hepatectomy. MethodsA whole cohort in whom the hanging manoeuver was attempted for a left hepatectomy from March 2003 to October 2011 was divided chronologically into three groups based on the <b>tape</b> <b>position</b> in the hilum along the ligamentum venosum (LV); conventionally between the right and left Glisson's pedicles (group 1), at the ventral side of the LV (group 2), and at the dorsal side of the LV (group 3). Patient characteristics, operative outcomes and complications defined using Clavien's classification were compared. ResultsA total of 151 patients were enrolled in one of three groups: group 1 (n = 54), group 2 (n = 35), and group 3 (n = 62). The hanging tape was successfully positioned in all patients as planned in the three groups. In group 2 and 3, the hanging manoeuver was continuously applied during a parenchymal transection. The Glisson's pedicle injury during hilar dissection was more common in group 2 (%, 51. 4 versus 5. 6 in group 1 and 3. 2 in group 3; P = 0. 001). Group 3 showed a shorter median operative time (min, 151 versus 210 in group 1 and 220 in group 2; P = 0. 001), a shorter median hospital stay (days, 7 versus 10 in group 1 and 2; P = 0. 012) and a lower complication rate (%, 1. 6 versus 13. 0 in group 1 and 37. 1 in group 2; P = 0. 001) without any operative mortality, major morbidity, blood transfusion or reoperation. ConclusionsThe hanging manoeuver had 100 % feasibility with good outcomes during a left hepatectomy. The tape should be positioned to surround the left Glisson's pedicle and LV together as this helps to protect the caudate lobe...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 65) The {{advent of}} helical scan recording systems {{has brought about}} the necessity for more sophisticated tracking systems. The {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) of data reproduced from the tape decreases dramatically if the reproduce head is not exactly aligned with the recorded track. Any loss of SNR directly affects the probability of data reproduction errors. An example of one such tracking control system is presented. This system is designed to provide for optimum overlap of the reproduce head on. the recorded track. This is accomplished by continuously comparing signal levels obtained from the tap with previous values, and applying control signals to maintain a maximum average level. The system is composed of two basic elements: the capstan servo, and a digital portion, known as autophasing. In itself, the capstan servo constitutes a feedback control system responsible for maintaining <b>tape</b> <b>position</b> and velocity. It drives the capstan motor and feedback is provided from an optical tachometer mounted on the capstan shaft. In the system studied, this servo is one element of a broader feedback loop which also includes the autophasing block. The feedback for the overall system is the actual high frequency signal reproduced from the tape. The block diagrams of each basic element and of the overall system are presented and described. Stability of the capstan servo loop is demonstrated through magnitude and phase plots. A simplified computer model of this system is developed. The system's output response is simulated with a variety of inputs: constant, ramp, and sine wave. The results are compared with that which is theoretically predicted. The simulation results reveal two design limitations which would cause mistracking and instability. Solutions to the problems are derived, in one instance using a truth table, and then implemented in the model by the insertion of new model blocks. The improved model is again tested with ramp and sine wave inputs, and the removal of the instability is demonstrated. Correct system operation is verified...|$|E
