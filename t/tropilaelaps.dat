40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{aspects of the}} two known brood parasites of honey bees from Asia, namely the {{tropical}} bee mites <b>Tropilaelaps</b> clareae Delfinado et Baker and <b>Tropilaelaps</b> koenigerum Delfinado-Baker et Baker. These species of <b>Tropilaelaps</b> belong to the family Laelapidae (Mesostigmata). They feed on bee larvae and pupae causing brood malformation {{and the death of}} bees. T. clareae occurs on 5 species of bee- Apis cerana, A. dorsata, A. florea, A. laboriosa and A. mellifera. T. clareae is known to have a wide disribution in Asia extending eastwards from Iran to Papua New Guinea. T. koenigerum on the other hand and as far as is known at present, has a more restricted distribution. Because of the great interest in Varroa {{and to a lesser extent}} Acarapis woodi Rennie, the importance of <b>Tropilaelaps</b> mites has not been sufficiently recognised. There is some concern that <b>Tropilaelaps</b> may become established on A. mellifera in temperate climates. <b>Tropilaelaps</b> mites therefore are an important potential threat to beekeeping in parts of the world other than South-East Asia...|$|E
40|$|At {{least two}} {{parasitic}} mites {{have moved from}} Asian species of honeybees to infest Apis mellifera. Of these two, Varroa destructor is more widespread globally while <b>Tropilaelaps</b> mercedesae has remained largely in Asia. <b>Tropilaelaps</b> mites are most problematic when A. mellifera is managed outside its native range in contact with Asian species of Apis. In areas where this occurs, beekeepers of A. mellifera treat aggressively for <b>Tropilaelaps</b> and Varroa is either outcompeted or is controlled {{as a result of}} the aggressive treatment regime used against <b>Tropilaelaps.</b> Many mite control products used worldwide may in fact control both mites but environmental conditions differ globally and thus a control product that works well in one area may be less or ineffective in other areas. This is especially true of volatile compounds. In the current research we tested several commercial products known to control Varroa and powdered sulfur for efficacy against <b>Tropilaelaps.</b> Additionally, we tested the cultural control method of making a hive division to reduce <b>Tropilaelaps</b> growth in both the parent and offspring colony. Making a split or nucleus colony significantly reduced mite population in both the parent and nucleus colony when compared to un-manipulated control colonies. The formic acid product, Mite-Away Quick Strips®, was the only commercial product that significantly reduced mite population 8 weeks after initiation of treatment without side effects.

40|$|Small hive beetle (SHB) and <b>Tropilaelaps</b> are bee {{diseases}} considered exotic in the EU. SHBis {{a flying}} coleopteran {{that can be}} attracted to the odours of bees and bee products. In addition, SHB can survive and reproduce {{on a variety of}} ripe fruits. <b>Tropilaelaps</b> is an ectoparasite that does not survive long without honey bee brood and cannot fly by itself. The methodology used to assess the risk of entry of these pests in this scientific opinion was adapted from a pest risk assessment for entry used in the field of plant health. A qualitative risk assessment was performed taking into account current legislation but excluding the implementation of risk reduction options. This approach allowed the assessment of the worst case scenario for each risk factor. The risk pathways with a high risk of pest entry are ‘import of bee products (use in apiculture) ’ for SHB and ‘accidental import of bees’ (unintended presence of bees in a non-bee consignment) for both pests. The other risk pathways are associated with a moderate or low risk of SHB or <b>Tropilaelaps</b> entry into the risk assessment area. Risk reduction options were assessed separately from the risk assessment. Examples of risk reduction options with a high effectiveness and a high technical feasibility are the use of health certificates to guarantee pest freedom of consignments and keeping consignments without honey bee brood. Options with a high effectiveness and technical feasibility were identified in all risk pathways except ‘accidental import of bees’ and ‘dispersal of the pest via natural means and/or flight’.

40|$|Honeybee colonies heavily {{infested with}} <b>Tropilaelaps</b> clareae {{were found in}} some apiaries in Afghanistan. Only colonies moved for winter to warmer areas where {{interruption}} of brood rearing did not occcur, were invaded, while those overwintered in colder areas were free of mites. From 2 to 54 % of brood cells were infested in particular colonies, but only 1. 5 % of adult bees were invaded. T. clareae mites on combs with eggs or on adult bees can survive for 1 - 2 days only. Adult mites are unable to feed on hemolymph of adult bees. Three methods are described to combat <b>Tropilaelaps.</b> Invasion of Apis mellifera by T. clareae in temperate zones where winter interruption of brood rearing occurs is not expected. But T. clareae can create real problems for beekeeping in tropical zones of all continents. INTRODUC 1 ’ION The major difficulty encountered after the introduction of Apis mellifera into tropical Asia {{was caused by the}} ectoparasitic bee mite Varroa jacobsoni, which naturally parasitizes Apis cerana, and <b>Tropilaelaps</b> clareae, which parasitizes Apis dorsata (CRANE, 1968; KEVAN et al., 1984). Invasion of A. mellifera colonies by T. clareae appears to be more destructive than that by V. jacobsoni and some believe that T. clareae could become a more serious pest of honeybees worldwide than V. jacobsoni (BuarETT et al., 1983). The major question regarding T. clareae concerns its potential escape from tropical Asia and whether it could become established on A. mellifera in tem-perate regions (BuacETT et al., 1983; BURGETT and KRANTZ, 1984). Adult T. clareae can survive without food for two days (AKRATANAUL, 1984). Depriving colonies of brood by destroying it or by caging the queen for 21 days decreases the mite population. The life span of T. clar-eae on adult bees has not yet been recorded. This was the main question studied in the present investigation. I have also tested a method to combat the mite without the use of drugs. Some of these investigations should be repeated and some results verified.

Understanding the ecological characteristics of T. mercedesae at molecular level could potentially result in improving the management and control programs. However, molecular and genomic characterization of T. mercedesae remains poorly studied, and even no genes have been deposited in Genbank to date.

40|$|Recent {{honey bee}} colony losses, {{particularly}} during the winter, {{have been shown to}} be associated with the presence of both ectoparasitic mites and Deformed Wing Virus (DWV). Whilst the role of Varroa destructor mites as a viral vector is well established, the role of <b>Tropilaelaps</b> mercedesae mites in viral transmission has not been fully investigated. In this study, we tested the effects that V. destructor and T. mercedesae infestation have on fluctuation of the DWV copy number and alteration of the virus variants in honey bees by characterizing individual pupae and their infesting mites. We observed that both mite species were associated with increased viral copy number in honey bee pupae. We found a positive correlation between DWV copy number in pupae and copy number in infesting mites, and the same DWV type A variant was present in either low or high copy number in both honey bee pupae and infesting V. destructor. These data also suggest that variant diversity is similar between honey bee pupae and the mites that infest them.

40|$|Few {{areas of}} the world have western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies that are free of {{invasive}} parasites Nosema ceranae (fungi) and Varroa destructor (mites). Particularly detrimental is V. destructor; in addition to feeding on host haemolymph, these mites are important vectors of several viruses that are further implicated as contributors to honey bee mortality around the world. Thus, the biogeography and attendant consequences of viral communities in the absence of V. destructor are of significant interest. The island of Newfoundland, Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, is free of V. destructor; the absence of N. ceranae has not been confirmed.

40|$|The {{environment}} and agriculture {{depend on a}} wide variety of pollinating species, including 20, 000 species of hymenoptera, the most important being the domestic honey bee (Apis mellifera). Worldwide, the annual value of this ecological service is estimated to be in excess of a hundred billion dollars. Since 1997, numerous eye-witness accounts and published articles have reported an apparent weakening and mortality of bee colonies in various countries around the world. The beekeeping profession estimates that national production of honey fell by 20 to 30 % between 1997 and 2009. The depopulation observed in apiaries is sometimes severe, leading to a reduction in honey production in the same proportion as the reduction in the number of bees. The weakening that occurs at the end of the beekeeping year may also result in a higher frequency of mortalities in winter. One can define six categories of causes of mortality of bee colonies: – bee diseases and parasites; – chemical products; – the environment; – beekeeping practices; – agricultural practices; – treatment of varroosis. Bee diseases and parasites The pathogens responsible for diseases and parasitic infestations are predators: parasites, fungi, bacteria and viruses. To date, there are 29 known pathogens of bees. This precise figure is based on numerous bibliographic references, including recent studies on the decline of bee populations. While all of them have the potential to cause mortality of bee colonies, some have been highlighted in the most recent investigations into the phenomenon of weakening, collapse and mortality of bee colonies, either individually or in association with others.

Behavioral responses of Apis cerana, Apis dorsata, and Apis mellifera to the ectoparasitic mite, <b>Tropilaelaps</b> mercedesae, were compared using two laboratory bioassays: cohorts of 50 caged worker bees and individual-caged worker bees, all of unknown ages. For the group bioassays, ten T. mercedesae were placed on the bodies of bees in each cohort. After 6 h, nearly 2 / 3 of the mites placed on A. cerana had fallen from the bees onto sticky traps that were placed under the cages, compared to only about 1 / 3 for A. dorsata and A. mellifera. The majority of fallen mites fell within 24 h from A. cerana (93. 3 [*]±[*] 2. 3 %), 36 h from A. dorsata (92. 2 [*]±[*] 1. 9 %), and 48 h from A. mellifera (91. 3 [*]±[*] 1. 4 %). Higher proportions of injured mites were observed among the mites that fell from A. cerana (38. 3 [*]±[*] 12. 9 %) and A. dorsata (33. 9 [*]±[*] 17. 4 %) than among those that fell from A. mellifera (19. 5 [*]±[*] 7. 2 %). The rapid fall of mites from the bodies of A. cerana may be due to a combination of auto-grooming and rapid body shaking of the bees. In individual bee assays, where individual bees were challenged with one female T. mercedesae, A. cerana and A. dorsata exhibited faster behavioral responses to the presence of mites than did A. mellifera (39. 4 [*]±[*] 13. 2, 44. 9 [*]±[*] 19. 2, and 188. 4 [*]±[*] 63. 9 s, respectively). Phoretic T. mercedesae were mostly observed attaching to the propodeum/petiole region of all three bee species, although some mites also occupied the wing base area of A. dorsata and A. mellifera...|$|E
