2500|$|On 18 August, General Albert d'Amade {{formed a}} defence line from Maubeuge to Dunkirk, {{to prevent the}} {{disruption}} of railways by German cavalry raids. The Scarpe, Escaut and Rhonelle sluices were opened to extend the floods of the Scarpe and the old forts of de Maulde, Flines, Curgies, Condé and Le Quesnoy around Valenciennes were re-occupied. On 20 August, d'Amade formed a line of three <b>territorial</b> <b>divisions</b> de campagne, with the 84th <b>Territorial</b> <b>Division</b> from the Scarpe to the Sambre, the 82nd <b>Territorial</b> <b>Division</b> from the Sambre to the Lys and the 81st <b>Territorial</b> <b>Division</b> from the Lys to the sea. When the BEF advanced {{to the west of}} Maubeuge, the 84th <b>Territorial</b> <b>Division</b> advanced to Condé and formed a new defensive line along the Escaut, from Condé to Maulde. On 23 August, the 88th <b>Territorial</b> <b>Division</b> arrived near Lille from Paris, with orders to recapture Tournai. The division was bombarded by heavy artillery when close to Cysoing the next morning and slowly retired to Templeuve and Arras. After the Battle of Charleroi (21 August) and the Battle of Mons (23 August), Amiens became vulnerable to the advance of the 1st Army as it pursued the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and the Fifth Army. At [...] on 24 August, the Siege of Maubeuge began and the 84th <b>Territorial</b> <b>Division</b> fell back towards Cambrai and Marquion. The rearguard was attacked near Fresnes, just south of Condé and next day, the division was engaged near Haspres and defeated.|$|R
