5|$|In 2015, the BBC {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>Horrible</b> Histories concept would be revived {{in a new}} format, focussing on {{the life and times}} of a single historical figure per episode. The rebooted series was again developed by LionTV and will involve a largely all-new production team and cast, while still retaining Jenner as lead historical consultant and many of the original series's writers. In addition, original stars Farnaby and Howick will return in limited roles.|$|E

She finds herself very {{attracted}} to Ted, but maintains other relationships and reminds Ted repeatedly that he has rejected {{the idea of a}} workplace romance with her. She seems to be a bit of an outsider to the corporate culture. Often she demands that Ted consider <b>the</b> <b>horrible</b> ramifications of the company policies or activities. Her relationship with the scientists is strained by her rejection of the weird things they do in the name of science. Despite this, she finds herself increasingly looking at Veronica as a mentor as the series progresses.|$|E

5|$|Doggett finally {{embraces the}} memory of his vision. Mulder tells him that when he worked in violent crimes and saw <b>the</b> <b>horrible</b> things people did, he began to think of evil like a disease that {{infected}} people. Some lack immunity to this disease of evil because of some tragedy in their lives. Jeb dies while Reyes and Katha are in the room. After the doctors leave, Katha’s eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the head with an oxygen tank and takes her gun. Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Freda {{felt that}} I Vampiri {{did not succeed}} financially in Italy due to the country's {{audience}} reluctance to an Italian interpretation of the horror genre. For Freda's next film, Caltiki – The Immortal Monster, he used an English pseudonym of Robert Hampton {{to give the impression}} that the film was not Italian. Freda attempted a gothic horror film again five years later with his film <b>The</b> <b>Horrible</b> Dr. Hichcock. Other crew members would go on to direct horror films following I Vampiri, such as screenwriter Piero Regnoli who directed The Playgirls and the Vampire (1960) and Bava who became the cinematographer on Freda's Caltiki as well as directing Black Sunday (1960).|$|E
5|$|The TV series used <b>the</b> <b>Horrible</b> Histories brand, logo and {{associated}} trademarks under licence from publisher Scholastic Books. It was produced for the BBC by LionTV and Citrus Television, with post-production being handled by Platform Post Production. Under series producer Norris and directors Brigstocke, Steve Connelly and Chloe Thomas, each series of thirteen episodes took approximately {{one year to}} produce. The process included several months of research into the historical facts, {{two to three months}} of writing, eight weeks of filming both on location and at London's Twickenham Studios, and three to four months of post-production.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson)—as well as ex-FBI agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases {{linked to the}} paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), and Doggett come up against <b>the</b> <b>horrible</b> {{consequences}} of the Syndicate’s pact with the aliens, as Billy Miles (Zachary Ansley)—now reprogrammed as a Supersoldier—attempts to erase all evidence of the tests—including Scully's soon-to-be-born baby. Upon hearing information from Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), the men reluctantly call upon him as well as Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) to help them.|$|E
5|$|Modern authors like Ernesto Palacio, Norberto Galasso, and Jorge Abelardo Ramos {{attempt to}} rescue the image of Moreno by {{avoiding}} both extremes: the sweet liberal Moreno and <b>the</b> <b>horrible</b> one written by revisionists. Those historians do not consider Bernardino Rivadavia a successor of Moreno, and the proposals to seek an alliance with Britain are not seen {{as the product of}} anglophilia, but just an example of the limited options available to the Primera Junta. Similarly, they do not attribute much influence to the Representation..., considering it a mere work for a client that didn't really influence Cisneros, who would have allowed free trade for international contexts. The harsh policies are acknowledged, but not attributed specifically to Moreno, but rather to the whole Junta, and compared with similar royalist measures used to punish the Chuquisaca, the La Paz revolution, and the indigenous rebellion of Túpac Amaru II.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{were determined}} that the show be respectful of audience expectations for <b>the</b> <b>Horrible</b> Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director Dominic Brigstocke concluded that the material {{was strong enough to}} stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase. Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media conventions as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.|$|E

25|$|Another source {{states that}} she was a pious young woman – a devout Covenanter – and, hearing of the martyrdom of Margaret Wilson (in 1684 or 1685) on Wigtown Sands, and being {{determined}} not to renounce the Covenant, she fled, like many others, from her home in Ayrshire to Ireland, and found employment in the county Down, where she acquired a knowledge of the Irish process of cheese making. The persecution of females having abated after <b>the</b> <b>horrible</b> event of Wigtown Sands, Miss Gilmour returned to her home in Dunlop, and became a farmer’s wife.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the fault}} was placed with Dix and captain Lermond {{it was found}} during the {{investigation}} that Jeanie was navigating in violation of law with only one engineer, the first assistant, on the engine; without {{the knowledge of the}} ship's master.

25|$|The Damned {{are taken}} to Hell and {{received}} by Demons is {{in stark contrast to}} the previous one. Signorelli has gone to the extremes of his fantasy and evocative powers to portray his cataclysmic vision of <b>the</b> <b>horrible</b> fate, the agony and the despair of the damned. He uses the naked human body as his only expressive element, showing the isolated bodies entangling each other, merging in a convoluted mass. They are overpowered by demons in near-human form, depicted in colours of every shade of decomposing flesh. Above them, a flying demon transports a woman. This is probably a depiction of the Whore of the Apocalypse.|$|E
