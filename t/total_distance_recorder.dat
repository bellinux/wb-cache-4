5000|$|In physics, {{there are}} two {{definitions}} for [...] "path length." [...] The first {{is defined as the}} <b>total</b> <b>distance</b> an object travels. Unlike displacement, which is the <b>total</b> <b>distance</b> an object travels from a starting point, path length is the <b>total</b> <b>distance</b> travelled, regardless of where it travelled. The second is synonymous with wavelength and is used in calculating constructive and destructive interference of waves.|$|R
50|$|The easiest {{example is}} the {{difference}} between net <b>distance</b> and <b>total</b> <b>distance.</b> For example, in walking from Point A to Point B along a straight line, one covers a net distance B &minus; A that is equal to the <b>total</b> <b>distance.</b> If one then returns to Point A, however, net distance is now 0 while <b>total</b> <b>distance</b> covered is 2*(B &minus; A). This example captures the essential idea behind the inexact differential in one dimension.|$|R
