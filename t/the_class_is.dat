5|$|Although the {{language}} of instruction is English, since its founding McGill has allowed students to write their thesis in French, and since 1964 students in all faculties {{have been able to}} submit any graded work in either English or French, provided that the objective of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> not to learn a particular language. The University has a bilingual language policy and charter.|$|E
5|$|NSB El 18 is a {{class of}} 22 {{electric}} locomotives built by Adtranz and Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM) for the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). <b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> a modification of the Swiss Federal Railways Re 460 locomotive and built at Adtranz Strømmen in 1996 and 1997. The class remains the only mainline electric locomotive used by NSB, and is predominantly used on some intercity services and all night trains on the Bergen Line, Dovre Line and Sørland Line, {{as well as some}} regional trains.|$|E
50|$|When {{imported}} <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> designated YH (YouHao meaning 'friendship'), {{but after}} the breakdown of Sino-Soviet relations during the Cultural revolution (see Sino-Soviet split) <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> renamed FX (FanXiu meaning 'anti-revisionist').

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>class</b> of 2016, {{entering}} {{the law school}} in 2013, included 119 students from 89 different undergraduate institutions and 29 states. Forty-six percent of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> ethnic minorities. Fifty-nine percent were Catholic, and 31% of other Christian faiths. <b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> 51% female. <b>The</b> median LSAT score for <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> 146 and <b>the</b> median GPA was 3.15.|$|R

5|$|The name of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> {{taken from}} the letter {{designating}} the first projected unit. As long as the ships were not named, they were referred to by letters assigned in the chronological order of their planned construction. The first planned unit {{would have been the}} thirteenth German cruiser and was therefore listed as cruiser M in the navy's documents. Had any of the ships been built, the class would have been named after the first completed unit.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary radar}} sensor of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> the EL/M-2248 MF-STAR {{multi-mission}} AESA. It is also equipped with Thales LW-08 long range volume search radar and EL/M-2238 S-band STAR surveillance radar from Israel Aerospace Industries. A Nagin active towed array sonar and a bow-mounted sonar HUMSA-NG (hull-mounted sonar array - new generation) are carried for sub-surface surveillance. To protect against anti-ship missiles coming from multiple directions, the ship carries the Elbit Systems Deseaver MK-II decoy control and launching system.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from those}} who became generals, the best known member of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> Louis A. Merrilat, who played college {{football}} with the Army Black Knights alongside Bradley and Eisenhower, and was selected as a first-team All-American in both 1913 and 1914. He was wounded in battle while serving in France during World War I, and later played in the National Football League for the Canton Bulldogs in the 1925 NFL season. He became a soldier of fortune, training Iran's Persian Guard, working with the Chinese Army in the 1930s, and serving in the French Foreign Legion. During World War II, he returned to active duty with the US Army, reaching the rank of colonel.|$|E

5|$|The Ohio {{class was}} {{designed}} in the 1970s to carry the concurrently-designed Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile. Both variants of the Tridents—the UGM-96 Trident I and the UGM-133 Trident II—are propelled by three-stage solid propellant rockets and are equipped with 8–14 nuclear warheads. The 73,000lb (33,100kg) UGM-96, {{with a range of}} 4,000mi (6,400km), served from October 1979, starting with the Benjamin Franklin-class USS Francis Scott Key, until 2006. The 130,000lb (59,000kg) UGM-133, with a range of 6,000mi (9,700km), is in service , having been introduced in 1990 with USS Tennessee. The primary self-defense weapon of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> the Mk 48 ADCAP torpedo. Ohio-class submarines that carry ballistic missiles receive orders from the United States Strategic Command based in Nebraska.|$|E
5|$|The {{class was}} the {{dominant}} locomotive on NSB's unelectrified lines. It was ordered {{as part of}} the company's dieselization of services during the 1950s and 1960s, and was initially used on the three mainline routes of the Bergen, Dovre and Nordland Lines. In the 1960s the Bergen and Dovre Lines were electrified and the Di 3 units transferred to smaller lines, such as the Meråker, Valdres, Røros, Solør and Rauma Lines. They remained in service with NSB until 2001, five years later than planned due to NSB returning their successor, the Di 6. The units are still in use by the private operator Ofotbanen, the Kosovo Railways, an operator in Sicily, and the Norwegian Railway Museum. <b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> similar to the DSB Class MY and MÁV M61.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuous}} {{classification of}} new taxa reveals that <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> not fully described. The class comprises around 900 to 1000 species. According to a 2000 inquiry, there were 1012 officially accepted taxa, including 866 on species level. Another study in 2007 stated {{a number of}} more than 1000, in which the Myxogastria comprised the biggest group of slime moulds, with over 900 species. On the basis of sequenced environmental samples {{it is estimated that}} the group has between 1200 and 1500 species, more than previously estimated. Among the 1012 taxa only a few species are common: 305 were discovered in a single location or groupings, a further 258 species were found in a few areas between two and 20 times, and only 446 were common in several locations with over 20 discoveries.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} {{based in}} the North Island, but four of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> sent to <b>the</b> South Island in 1981. <b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> slowly dispersed to secondary yards on the New Zealand network, such as Napier, Dunedin and Invercargill. In the early 1980s, two DE class members received English Electric 6SRKT Mk 2 engines (which were fitted to <b>the</b> DG <b>class</b> locomotives).|$|R
50|$|Six {{locomotives}} of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> built; introduced between 1934 and 1936. Between 1943 and 1944 <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt under Gresley's successor Edward Thompson into <b>the</b> LNER Thompson <b>Class</b> A2/2 4-6-2 type.|$|R

5|$|The {{units were}} ordered by NSB in 1992 as {{replacements}} for the aging Di3, and were particularly {{intended for use}} on the Nordland Line {{and to a lesser}} extent on the Røros Line. Construction was done by Maschinenbau Kiel (MaK) in Kiel, Germany, which was then part of Siemens Schienenfahrzeugtechnik. <b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> largely based on the MaK-built DB Class 240, with each unit costing 32 million Norwegian krone (NOK). The first units were delivered in March 1996, one year after schedule, but were plagued with faults. By 1999, the entire order was terminated and the locomotives returned to Germany. They were taken over by locomotive lessor Dispolok and were used by various Germany railway companies. Ownership was taken over by Vossloh in 2003, after which most of the class were leased to German passenger train operator Nord-Ostsee-Bahn. In 2008, three units returned to Norway and are used by Cargolink for freight trains.|$|E
5|$|This {{beautiful}} species, {{which is}} sufficiently characterised to {{distinguish it from}} every other individual of <b>the</b> <b>class,</b> <b>is</b> copiously produced in Dutch Guiana, about 300 paces from the sea, and nearly {{as far from the}} left bank of the river of Surinam. It was communicated to me by the elder Vaillant, who discovered it in 1755 on some raised ground which was never overflowed by the highest tides, and is formed of a very fine white sand, covered with a thin stratum of earth. The prodigious quantity of individuals of this species which grow at the same time, the very different periods of their expansion, the brilliancy and the varied shades of their colours, present a prospect truly picturesque. The fungus was later placed in a new genus, Dictyophora, in 1809 by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux; it was then known for many years as Dictyophora indusiata. Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck placed the species in Hymenophallus in 1817, as H.indusiatus. Both genera were eventually returned to synonyms of Phallus and the species is now known again by its original name.|$|E
5|$|The net could ensnare the secutors {{weapon to}} disarm him and snag away his shield {{to put him}} at a {{significant}} disadvantage. Other retiarius tricks were to whip the net at his opponent's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him. The helmet of the secutor was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net. In most cases, the secutor knew to expect the net-man's tactics and tried to intercept and {{hold on to the}} weapon, possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net. In such danger, the retiarius could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger. The secutor stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it. Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the retiarius used his net. Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net, yet <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> named for the device, and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a retiarius in his satires. The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance, and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict. The lack of nets in retiarius images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight. Another possibility is that some retiarii simply did not use nets.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> Belorussiya <b>class</b> cruiseferries (sometimes also {{referred}} to as <b>the</b> Gruziya <b>class)</b> <b>were</b> built by Wärtsilä Turku Shipyard, Finland in 1975–1976 for the Black Sea Shipping Company, Soviet Union. The five ships in <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> originally used in ferry service around the Black Sea. During the 1980s all ships in <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> rebuilt into cruise ships. During the end of the 1990s all ships in <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> sold to other operators. As of 2008, at least four ships in this <b>class</b> <b>were</b> in service. <b>The</b> effects of the new SOLAS regulations that came into effect in 2010 remain unknown.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} for patrol and fishery protection tasks in coastal and inshore territorial waters. The first of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> delivered some 18 months late, {{and the rest}} approximately two years late.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> {{based at}} HMNB Devonport, {{in the city}} of Plymouth, England.|$|E

25|$|It {{can also}} happen that some {{unidentified}} gifted students will get bored in regular class, daydream and {{lose track of}} where <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> in a lecture, and the teacher becomes convinced that the student is slow and struggling with the material.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> later also shedded at Exmouth Junction {{where they}} shared the Ocean Liner special expresses to and from Plymouth with <b>the</b> S11 <b>class.</b> Although <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> {{relatively}} well received by locomotive crews, there was no discernible improvement over the T9s {{it was supposed to}} develop from, and as such, led uneventful careers after the accident of 1906. They began to be withdrawn soon after Nationalisation in 1948, by which time <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> used for local freight working on rural lines. The last of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> struck off in 1951, ending its life on pick-up/set down goods trains on the Meon Valley Railway. None survived for preservation.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Patriot <b>Class</b> <b>was</b> a <b>class</b> of 52 express {{passenger}} steam locomotives {{built for}} the London Midland and Scottish Railway. The first locomotive of <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> built in 1930 and the last in 1934. All of <b>the</b> Patriot <b>class</b> locomotives <b>were</b> withdrawn from service by 1965. <b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> based on <b>the</b> chassis of the Royal Scot combined with the boiler from Large Claughtons earning them the nickname Baby Scots.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> {{numbered}} 657-666, {{and just}} as <b>the</b> T3 <b>class</b> <b>were</b> a smaller-wheeled version of <b>the</b> X2 <b>class,</b> <b>the</b> X6 <b>class</b> <b>were</b> a smaller-wheeled version of <b>the</b> T6 <b>class.</b> <b>The</b> boiler <b>was</b> identical to that used <b>the</b> T6 <b>class.</b> Some of <b>the</b> engines were subsequently fitted with a Drummond boiler, including No. 658 which was the last Adams 4-4-0 to remain in service.|$|R
25|$|The U-20 {{class was}} {{a class of}} four U-boats, U-20, U-21, U-22, and U-23. <b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as the Havmanden class because it was based upon the design of the Royal Danish Navy's 1911 Havmanden class submarines, three of which were built in Fiume.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>is</b> {{going to}} the weather station to learn about weather. However, on the way there the bus turns into a hot air balloon.

50|$|In 1988, <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> redesignated as <b>Class</b> 405.95. From 1993, {{the rack}} railway and <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>were</b> owned and {{operated}} by Železnice Slovenskej republiky (ŽSR). Since 2002, the operator has been Železničná spoločnosť Slovensko (ZSSK).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> {{withdrawn}} progressively from {{service from}} 1965 for 241.P.1 to 1973 for 241.P.16. Their last regular work, on the Le Mans to Nantes route, ended in early 1970. <b>The</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> nicknamed <b>the</b> grosses P to distinguish them from <b>the</b> 141.P <b>Class,</b> which <b>were</b> called <b>the</b> petites P.|$|R
50|$|In the 1979 renumbering, <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> {{altered to}} become the VVAP's. However they did not last long, as <b>the</b> <b>class</b> <b>was</b> not relettered until 1983-1986 and by this time guards vans were being {{eliminated}} on freight trains.|$|R
