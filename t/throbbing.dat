5|$|Industrial Music for Industrial People was {{originally}} coined by Monte Cazazza as the strapline {{for the record}} label Industrial Records, founded by British art-provocateurs <b>Throbbing</b> Gristle. The first wave of this music appeared with <b>Throbbing</b> Gristle, from London; Cabaret Voltaire, from Sheffield; and Boyd Rice (recording under the name NON), from the United States. <b>Throbbing</b> Gristle first performed in 1976, and began as the musical offshoot of the Kingston upon Hull-based COUM Transmissions. COUM was initially a psychedelic rock group, but began to describe their work as performance art {{in order to obtain}} grants from the Arts Council of Great Britain. COUM was composed of P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti. Beginning in 1972, COUM staged several performances inspired by Fluxus and Viennese Actionism. These included various acts of sexual and physical abjection. Peter Christopherson, an employee of commercial artists Hipgnosis, joined the group in 1974, with Carter joining the following year.|$|E
5|$|A dance-oriented song, it lyrically {{portrays a}} scorned woman seeking revenge on her lover. Police sirens, whispered vocals, <b>throbbing</b> beats and a dubstep {{breakdown}} provide the song with a suspense-filled atmosphere. The song received critical acclaim, most {{calling it a}} highlight of the album and also the boldest track of the album. Some even hailed {{it as one of}} Madonna's best songs.|$|E
5|$|Though {{electric}} guitars {{had been}} used by industrial artists {{since the early days}} of the genre, archetypal industrial groups such as <b>Throbbing</b> Gristle displayed a strong anti-rock stance. British post-punk band Killing Joke pioneered the crossing over between styles, and was an influence on major industrial metal bands such as Ministry, Godflesh, and Nine Inch Nails. Another pioneer industrial rock group, Big Black, also impacted some later groups.|$|E

6000|$|There {{was a long}} silence. The distant <b>throbbings</b> of {{the bell}} pulsed through it, and we stood {{motionless}} and listening. But it was broken at last: ...|$|R
60|$|Nature did {{pause to}} listen. The wind was hushed, the night-birds {{in the forest}} had gone to rest. Marguerite's heart beat so fast that its <b>throbbings</b> choked her, and a {{dizziness}} clouded her consciousness.|$|R
5|$|Alveolar osteitis is a {{complication}} of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) {{in which the}} blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and <b>throbbing</b> in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to {{four days after the}} extraction, and may last 10–40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the breakup}} of <b>Throbbing</b> Gristle, P-Orridge and Christopherson founded Psychic TV and signed to a major label. Their first album was much more {{accessible}} and melodic than the usual industrial style, and included hired work by trained musicians. Later work returned to the sound collage and noise elements of earlier industrial. They also borrowed from funk and disco. P-Orridge also founded Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, a quasi-religious organization that produced video art. Psychic TV's commercial aspirations were managed by Stevo of Some Bizzare records, who released many of the later industrial musicians, including Eistürzende Neubauten, Test Dept, and Cabaret Voltaire.|$|E
5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50–75% {{of all cases}} of {{vertebral}} artery dissection. It tends to be located {{at the back of}} the head, either on the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or <b>throbbing.</b> About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E
60|$|By degrees, a {{composite}} feeling of blended strength and pain wound itself wirily round my heart, sustained, {{or at least}} restrained, its <b>throbbings,</b> and made me fit for the day's work. I lifted my head.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have sent}} for you, Corny," [...] she said, laying {{a hand on}} her heart, as if to quiet its <b>throbbings,</b> [...] "to say one word in the way of caution--I hope it is not wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can you do this, Tuscarora"--she asked, earnestly, {{pressing}} {{her hand on}} her heart as if to quiet its <b>throbbings.</b> [...] "Can you really lead me to Major Willoughby, so that I may have some hope of liberating him?" ...|$|R
5|$|Later on, {{the priest}} tells Chen {{to visit a}} lunatic beggar at the marketplace, should she wish to revive her husband. The madman treats her with disrespect by {{continuously}} demeaning her, but she takes it in her stride and patiently pleads with him for help. Finally, he coughs out some phlegm and makes her swallow it. The beggar makes his leave and Chen is left feeling deeply ashamed. Back home, during funeral preparations, the phlegm hardens gradually and rises from Chen's stomach to her throat. Ultimately she disgorges a <b>throbbing</b> heart, which she places into the gaping wound in Wang's chest; slowly, his life is restored.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups in}} the British grindcore scene, such as Heresy and Unseen Terror, have {{emphasized}} the influence of American hardcore punk, including Septic Death, as well as Swedish D-beat. Sore Throat cites Discharge, Disorder, {{and a variety of}} European D-beat and thrash metal groups, including Hellhammer, and American hardcore groups, such as Poison Idea and D.R.I.. Japanese hardcore, particularly GISM, is also mentioned by a number of originators of the style. Other key groups cited by current and former members of Napalm Death as formative influences include Discharge, Amebix, <b>Throbbing</b> Gristle, and the aforementioned Dirty Rotten Imbeciles. Post-punk, such as Killing Joke and Joy Division, was also cited as an influence on early Napalm Death.|$|E
5|$|Post-punk brought {{together}} a new fraternity of musicians, journalists, managers, and entrepreneurs; the latter, notably Geoff Travis of Rough Trade and Tony Wilson of Factory, helped {{to develop the}} production and distribution infrastructure of the indie music scene that blossomed in the mid-1980s. Smoothing the edges of their style {{in the direction of}} new wave, several post-punk bands such as New Order (descended from Joy Division) and the Cure. crossed over to a mainstream U.S. audience. Bauhaus was one of the formative gothic rock bands. Others, like Gang of Four, the Raincoats and <b>Throbbing</b> Gristle, who had little more than cult followings at the time, are seen in retrospect as significant influences on modern popular culture.|$|E
60|$|A {{gentle breeze}} from over the distant hills blew on the dreamer's {{forehead}} and eased the wild <b>throbbings</b> of his temples; from somewhere near tiny petals of heliotrope, chased by the breeze, brought sweet-scented powder to his nostrils.|$|R

5|$|The first {{industrial}} artists {{experimented with}} noise and aesthetically controversial topics, musically and visually, such as fascism, serial killers and the occult. Their production {{was not limited}} to music, but included mail art, performance art, installation pieces and other art forms. Prominent industrial musicians include <b>Throbbing</b> Gristle, Monte Cazazza, SPK, Boyd Rice, Cabaret Voltaire, and Z'EV. The precursors that influenced the development of the genre included acts such as electronic group Kraftwerk, experimental rock acts such as Pink Floyd and Frank Zappa, psychedelic rock artists such as Jimi Hendrix, and composers such as John Cage. Musicians also cite writers such as William S. Burroughs, and philosophers such as Friedrich Nietzsche as influences.|$|E
5|$|The first {{movement}} is in cut common (2/2) time. It {{starts with the}} cello, alone, playing eight quarter notes on the same B-flat. It is not until the third measure of the movement that the violins and viola enter. The cello's eight <b>throbbing</b> notes act as more than an introduction. They reappear at critical junctures throughout the movement, including {{at the beginning of}} the development and recapitulation sections, illustrating that they are part of the movement's primary thematic material. The melody that follows the eight cello notes is echoed in Beethoven's String Quartet No. 1 (Op. 18, No. 1).|$|E
5|$|After {{the team}} finds and stores Pierce's body, Mulder reviews Trepkos' {{fragmented}} notes. He finds references {{to a new}} silicon-based organism existing inside Mount Avalon; Scully, however, doubts his conclusions because of his mental state. Tanaka breaks into convulsions and displays a high fever, but refuses any help from Mulder or Scully. When he is put on a stretcher for a medivac pickup, Mulder notices a <b>throbbing</b> bulge in his neck. Tanaka flees {{into the woods and}} dies when a tentacle bursts out of his throat. An autopsy by Scully finds sand in his lungs, indicating the existence of a silicon-based spore; she theorizes that when exposed, the spore infects the nearest hosts or otherwise dies. Mulder contacts the CDC to have them quarantine the site.|$|E
6000|$|... "Strange <b>throbbings</b> seized me; my soul tossed {{on its own}} tides. But {{soon the}} inward harmony bounded in exulting choral strains. I heard a {{feathery}} rush; and straight beheld a form, traced all over with veins of vivid light. The vision undulated round me.|$|R
60|$|The taxicab {{which had}} brought the police {{officers}} was standing some few paces farther on, its strong lights only just piercing {{the intensity of the}} fog, and its <b>throbbings,</b> as the taximeter marked off twopences with unerring rapidity, filled the night with their strangely familiar sound.|$|R
60|$|Then gradually, {{but very}} slowly, {{with the long}} months and years, came to me the {{consciousness}} of a new being, new pulsations, sensories, <b>throbbings,</b> rooted in but differing widely from the old; and little Paul, the Paul of whom I have hitherto spoken, faded from my life.|$|R
5|$|Pulpitis is {{classified}} as reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts {{for a short time}} after a stimulus (for instance, cold or sweet); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause <b>throbbing</b> pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Much less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of IIH is headache, which occurs {{in almost all}} (92–94%) cases. It is {{characteristically}} worse in the morning, generalized in character and <b>throbbing</b> in nature. It {{may be associated with}} nausea and vomiting. The headache can be made worse by any activity that further increases the intracranial pressure, such as coughing and sneezing. The pain may also be experienced in the neck and shoulders. Many have pulsatile tinnitus, a whooshing sensation in one or both ears (64–87%); this sound is synchronous with the pulse. Various other symptoms, such as numbness of the extremities, generalized weakness, loss of smell, and loss of coordination, are reported more rarely; none are specific for IIH. In children, numerous nonspecific signs and symptoms may be present.|$|E
5|$|A general {{principle}} concerning dental abscesses is ubi pus, ibi evacua ("{{where there is}} pus, drain it"), which applies to any case {{where there is a}} collection of pus in the tissues (such as a periodontal abscess, pericoronal abscess, or apical abscess). The pus within the abscess is under pressure, and the surrounding tissues are deformed and stretched to accommodate the swelling. This leads to a sensation of <b>throbbing</b> (often in time with the pulse) and constant pain. Pus may be evacuated via the tooth by drilling into the pulp chamber (an endodontic access cavity). Such a treatment is sometimes termed open drainage. Drainage can also be performed via the tooth socket, once the causative tooth is extracted. If neither of those measures succeeds, or they are impossible, incision and drainage may be required, in which a small incision is made in the soft tissues directly over the abscess at the most dependent point. A surgical instrument such as a pair of tweezers is gently inserted into the incision and opened, while the abscess is massaged to encourage the pus to drain out. Usually, the reduction in pain when the pus drains is immediate and marked as the built up pressure is relieved. If the pus drains into the mouth, there is usually a bad or offensive taste.|$|E

6000|$|Our songs {{went up and}} out the chimney, And roused the home-gone husbandmen; Our allemands, our heys, poussettings, Our hands-across {{and back}} again, Sent rhythmic <b>throbbings</b> through the casements [...] On to the white highway, Where nighted farers paused and muttered, [...] "Keep it up well, do they!" ...|$|R
60|$|Lily hurried away to Emily's room, {{and found}} what {{might well have}} tried her temper. Emily was flushed indeed, and feverish, but her {{breathing}} was smooth and even, and her hand and pulse cool and slow, compared with the parched burning hands, and <b>throbbings,</b> too quick to count, which Lily had just been watching.|$|R
5|$|Female {{macaroni}} penguins {{can begin}} breeding at around {{five years of}} age, while the males do not normally breed until at least six years old. Females breed {{at a younger age}} because the male population is larger. The surplus of male penguins allows the female penguins to select more experienced male partners as soon as the females are physically able to breed. Commencing a few days after females arrive at the colony, sexual displays are used by males to attract partners and advertise their territory, and by pairs once together at the nest site and at changeover of incubation shifts. In the 'ecstatic display', a penguin bows forward, making loud <b>throbbing</b> sounds, and then extends its head and neck up until its neck and beak are vertical. The bird then waves its head from side to side, braying loudly. Birds also engage in mutual bowing, trumpeting, and preening. Monitoring of pair fidelity at South Georgia has shown around three-quarters of pairs will breed together again the following year.|$|E
5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, <b>throbbing</b> pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E

60|$|My heart {{gave one}} great leap in me, and broke into vehement <b>throbbings,</b> {{which made it}} {{impossible}} for me to say a word more. I reined up my horse, and fixed my eyes on Michael.
