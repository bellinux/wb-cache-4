Investors judge the abilities of fund managers and decide whether to keep or fire them based on their past performance. Career concerns of fund managers distort their strategies which effect prices. In equilibrium, investors keep those arbitrageurs with higher probability who speculate on fast convergence of prices, even if the expected profit of this strategy is lower.

The personal space afforded to a person with a visible difference (with a <b>temporary</b> <b>difference</b> [...] a scar and a permanent difference [...] a strawberry hemangioma) or a person without a visible difference by 408 pedestrians on a busy pedestrian walkway in the central business district of Adelaide, Australia, was measured.

Pedestrians stood no further away from the model in the visibly different conditions than in the nonvisibly different conditions. Pedestrians stood an average of 128 cm away in the control condition, 120 cm away in the scar condition, and 140 cm away in the birthmark condition. People did not stand to the nonvisibly different (left) side of the model more frequently in the visibly different conditions than in the nonvisibly different conditions. As the original research by N. Rumsey et al. is frequently cited as representing the current situation for people with visible differences, failing to replicate the result is significant.

40|$|An entity has {{a foreign}} {{subsidiary}} operating {{in an economy}} that is considered highly inflationary for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the entity's reporting currency has been used as the subsidiary's functional currency in accordance with Statement 52. Except for inflation considerations, the subsidiary's functional currency would have been the local currency. Because of significant declines in the rate of inflation for the local currency in recent years, the foreign economy is no longer considered highly inflationary. The issue is how the entity should account for a change in its subsidiary's functional currency from the reporting currency to the local currency when the economy ceases to be considered highly inflationary. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that paragraph 46 of Statement 52 does not apply to this type of change and that the entity should restate the functional currency accounting bases of nonmonetary assets and liabilities at the date of change as follows: the reporting currency amounts at the date of change should be translated into the local currency at current exchange rates and those amounts should become the new functional currency accounting bases for the nonmonetary assets and liabilities.

The aim of this thesis is to continue the tradition of research and try to shed some more light on the mental health aspects of peacekeeping operations. Two methods were used to accomplish this. One was to study a Swedish battalion serving for 6 months in NATO´s IFOR mission in Bosnia in 1996, using a longitudinal approach. Questionnaires covering predeployment factors, general mental health, traumatic experiences and effects of support were used. The other method was to perform a register study in which 39 768 individuals who had served in peacekeeping missions were compared to a matched group of the general population with regard to differences in suicide rates. The general level of mental health problems and post-traumatic reactions was low and did not change over time. Traumatic experiences during service only appeared to make a <b>temporary</b> <b>difference</b> in general mental health. There are indications that possible predictors for poor mental health in peacekeepers could be constituted by: lower mean scores on the SOC questionnaire and on the Emotional Stability scale of the FFPI; personality disorders in general; prior family problems or psychiatric problems expressed through suicidal thoughts before deployment and problems experienced post-deployment, such as "relationship problems", death of a close relative", or "financial problems". It was found that the combination of peer support and a defusing session led by platoon commanders had positive effects on the post deployment mental health. The rate of personality disorders appears to be at the same level as or at a slightly lower level than in the general population.
