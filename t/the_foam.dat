5|$|The fire {{may have}} been caused by the {{accidental}} ignition of polyurethane foam insulation used on the building's outer walls. In China, <b>the</b> <b>foam</b> is commonly used as insulation material without the addition of flame retardants, and <b>the</b> <b>foam</b> produces toxic gases and carbon monoxide when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation, which magnified the ferocity of a 2009 fire that consumed the center. In a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be switched out in favor of fire-resistant materials. Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor fire sprinkler system in high rise buildings.|$|E

5|$|The {{shape and}} size of the egg mass is {{characteristic}} of the species. Ranids tend to produce globular clusters containing large numbers of eggs whereas bufonids produce long, cylindrical strings. The tiny yellow-striped pygmy eleuth (Eleutherodactylus limbatus) lays eggs singly, burying them in moist soil. The smoky jungle frog (Leptodactylus pentadactylus) makes a nest of foam in a hollow. The eggs hatch when the nest is flooded, or the tadpoles may complete their development in <b>the</b> <b>foam</b> if flooding does not occur. The red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) deposits its eggs on a leaf above a pool and when they hatch, the larvae fall into the water below. The larvae developing in the eggs can detect vibrations caused by nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten. In general, the length of the egg stage depends on the species and the environmental conditions. Aquatic eggs normally hatch within one week when the capsule splits as a result of enzymes released by the developing larvae.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A new foaming {{process has}} been {{developed}} for epoxy resins. Uncured epoxy tablets are fabricated by pressing commercial powders in a steel mold at room temperature and used as <b>foam</b> precursors. <b>The</b> tablets <b>foam</b> when heated in a muffle at high temperature. No blowing agent was added because <b>the</b> <b>foaming</b> mechanism depends on the uncured resin boiling point. <b>The</b> <b>foaming</b> temperature is set to be high enough to rapidly produce the resin boiling but not excessive to avoid the thermal degradation. During boiling, the epoxy resin polymerizes and the bubbles freeze in the final structure. Epoxy foams are obtained by heating the compacted tablets in cylindrical copper molds, having internal diameter equal to the tablet diameter. Several process parameters have been changed in the experiment to understand their correlation with <b>the</b> <b>foaming</b> efficiency. However, <b>the</b> <b>foaming</b> ratio (expressed {{in terms of the}} ratio between the final and the initial tablet height) is found to be mainly dependent on the initial tablet density. In optimal conditions, <b>the</b> <b>foaming</b> ratio can rise up to 6.

30|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} vulcanization {{time on the}} damping properties of foamed EPDM rubber is shown in Fig. 5, where the vulcanization temperature is 165  °C. It {{can be seen from}} Fig.  5 a that <b>the</b> <b>foamed</b> EPDM rubber has the largest storage modulus when the vulcanization time is 15  min. At other curing times, the storage modulus is not much different. This is because when the vulcanization time reaches 15  min, the vulcanization rate is already fast, the degree of crosslinking is already high, but <b>the</b> <b>foaming</b> is still in the early stage, and the gas pressure generated by the decomposition of the blowing agent is mostly insufficient to open the cross-linked EPDM rubber matrix, so that the cells are difficult to form. At this time, <b>the</b> <b>foamed</b> EPDM rubber has a small internal cell and a small number. When the vulcanization time is 20  min, at this time, the vulcanization rate of <b>the</b> <b>foamed</b> EPDM rubber is close to that of vulcanization at 15  min, but <b>the</b> <b>foaming</b> agent is decomposed in a large amount, and the internal pressure generated is too large, which breaks the cross-linking, and finally forms many cells. Thereafter, when the vulcanization time is 25  min, 30  min, and 35  min, the vulcanization rate and <b>the</b> <b>foaming</b> speed are both fast, <b>the</b> <b>foaming</b> and vulcanization reach a dynamic balance, and a large number of cells having a uniform pore diameter are produced [17].|$|R
