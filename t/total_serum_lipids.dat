So by using this method, <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> were determined in normal, healthy infants and children, as well as infants and children suffering from various diseases. The values obtained are as follows: 301 mg/dl for cord blood; 549 mg/dl for newborn; 542 mg/dl for infant; 488 mg/dl for child; 555 mg/dl for child of school age; 499 mg/dl for premature; 1498 mg/dl for child with nephrosis; and 942 mg/dl for child with hypothyroidism. <b>Total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> were determined before and after administration of cows 2 ̆ 7 milk, oil milk and acid milk (citric acid milk) in the same infants. <b>Total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> increase curves showed that there was the greatest increase in <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> following the administration of oil milk, indicating that fat of oil milk is fit fairly well to be absorbed. <b>Total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> increase curves, which were obtained following administration of cows 2 ̆ 7 milk, cows 2 ̆ 7 added with 10...|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate {{the effects of a}} fat-supplemented diet on the horse. Experiment one examined the effect of a diet which contained 20 % digestible energy as corn oil fed to four horses in comparison with a control group. Plasma lipoproteins, muscle lipoprotein lipase, <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids,</b> and ultrasound-estimated body fat were monitored for 10 weeks. The plasma lipoproteins fractionated into VLDL, LDL, HDL and albumin, and each was assayed for protein, cholesterol and triglyceride content. Results indicated that the fat-fed horses increased in LDL and HDL protein, VLDL triglyceride, and LDL and HDL cholesterol content. There was a slight increase in <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> while body fat was unchanged. In experiment two, two horses were fed the same fat diet and two horses served as controls. <b>Total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> and plasma lipoproteins were analyzed from samples obtained during a post-prandial sampling period at 2, 4, and 6 weeks of the trial. Results indicated an adaptation by the fat-fed horses to the added dietary fat through an increase in lipoprotein protein content, suggesting larger quantities of the lipoprotein fractions. LDL and HDL cholesterol levels also increased. Finally, VLDL triglyceride levels increased in the fat-supplemented horses reflecting the increased absorption and availability for utilization of the added dietary fat. Experiment three examined the effect of a fat-supplemented diet on exercising horses. All seven horses were fed the high fat diet, and four of them were exercised. A standard exercise test was administered at the start and end of the trial to assess the conditioning program. <b>Total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids,</b> plasma lipoproteins and percent body fat were monitored at weeks 3 and 6 of the trial. Blood samples were collected as in experiment two. The exercised horses exhibited lower VLDL and LDL triglyceride levels as well as lower LDL cholesterol levels. These data suggest that exercise increased the utilization of dietary fat for exercise in the horse, and could subsequently be used as a high-energy feed source in these animals...|$|E
40|$|Results {{with the}} “sulfo-phospho-vanillin ” reac-tion, much used for {{determining}} <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids,</b> have been favorably {{compared with those}} for the gravimetric method. We investigated the basic chemistry of the reaction and determined the reactivity of this single reagent with various lipids. Our results suggest that: (a) The reaction requires a carbon-carbon double bond. (b) Con-centrated sulfuric acid reacts with unsaturated lipids in the initial step to form a carbonium ion. (c) Phosphoric acid reacts with vanillin to produce a phosphate ester, with a resulting increase in the reactivity of the carbonyl group. (d) The carbo-nium ion reacts with the carbonyl group of phos-phovanillin to form a colored compound, which is stabilized by resonance. (e) Unsaturated com-pounds {{with more than one}} double bond react, but reaction may vary with steric hindrance. (f) The method is reasonably precise, but its accuracy depends primarily on the reference standard used. The “sulfo-phospho-vanillin ” reaction for de-termination of <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> was first intro-duced by Chabrol and Charonnat (1). Subse-quently, there have been several modifications (2 - 4) of the basic procedure. The method is simple, rapid, and reasonably precise. The re-sults reportedly compare favorably with those ob-tained by methods based on extraction and gravim-etry (3, 5, 6), and it has been recommended as an acceptable procedure for routine use. Because the reaction mechanism has not been studied, it seemed advisable to do so to clarify the specificity of the method...|$|E

Spearman correlation coefficients between the two measurements ranged from 0. 42 for percent of energy from fat to 0. 66 for sugar intake (median r = 0. 51). On average, 39 % {{of the men were}} classified in the same quartile with the two methods, and 3 % in the opposite quartile. Correlation coefficients between intake of fatty acids estimated from the questionnaire and the relative amounts of fatty acids in adipose tissue were: linoleic acid (18 : 2, n- 6), r = 0. 38; alpha-linolenic acid (18 : 3, n- 3), r = 0. 42; eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5, n- 3), r = 0. 52; and docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6, n- 3), r = 0. 49. The correlations for these fatty acids between the <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> and the diet were 0. 16, 0. 28, 0. 51 and 0. 52, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of diabetes is higher among Mexican Americans than among non-Hispanic whites. Higher serum levels of organochlorine pesticides in Mexican Americans have been reported. Few studies have explored {{the association between}} pesticide exposure and diabetes. OBJECTIVES: We set out to examine the association between self-reported diabetes and serum concentrations of organochlorine pesticides among Mexican Americans residing in the southwestern United States from 1982 to 1984. METHODS: This study was conducted among a sample of 1, 303 Mexican Americans 20 – 74 years of age from the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Serum concentrations were available for seven pesticides or pesticide metabolites at quantifiable levels in at least 1 % of the study population: p,p´-DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), p,p´-DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), dieldrin, oxychlordane, β-hexachlorocyclohexane, hexachlorobenzene, and transnonachlor.

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate the effects of dietary excess of vitamin B 6 on certain blood parameters [serum total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and total lipid] and the cerebral cortex. Materials and Methods: A total of 36 albino rats {{were included in the}} study. Saline solution was administered to control groups (CG- 10, n = 6 for 10 days; CG- 15, n = 6 for 15 days; CG- 20, n = 6 for 20 days). The experimental groups (EG- 10, n = 6; EG- 15, n = 6; EG- 20, n = 6) received 5 mg/kg vitamin B 6 daily for 10 days, 15 days and 20 days, respectively. <b>Serum</b> <b>total</b> cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and total lipid levels were measured and compared in CGs and EGs. The cerebral cortex tissue samples were examined by electron microscopy. Results: The <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> cholesterol levels were significantly lower (P < 0. 05) although serum HDL levels were significantly higher (P < 0. 01) in all EGs. <b>Total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipid</b> levels were higher in EG- 15 and EG- 20 groups than in CGs. The structural degenerations in the perikaryon and neuropil were found prominent in EG- 15 and EG- 20 groups but not in EG- 10. Marked damage in the neuronal and neuropilic structure was observed in rats who received long–term high doses of vitamin B 6. Based on these results, a relationship between cerebral cortex damage and <b>serum</b> <b>total</b> <b>lipid</b> and HDL levels in the EG- 15 and EG- 20 groups is suggested.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Familial {{combined}} hyperlipidaemia (FCH) {{is associated}} with insulin resistance. We hypothesized that pioglitazone treatment of FCH patients might increase insulin sensitivity, but may also improve <b>serum</b> <b>lipid</b> levels, body fat distribution, intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) and endothelial function. DESIGN: Double blind, randomized, cross-over study. SUBJECTS: Seventeen FCH patients. INTERVENTIONS: Sixteen weeks of pioglitazone treatment (30 mg) compared with 16 weeks of placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Insulin sensitivity was measured using the hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp procedure, body fat distribution and IMCL using magnetic resonance techniques and endothelial function using flow-mediated vasodilatation. RESULTS: Pioglitazone improved insulin sensitivity (M value 37. 7 +/- 3. 6 micromol min(- 1) kg(- 1) vs. 33. 0 +/- 3. 3 micromol min(- 1) kg(- 1) during placebo, P < 0. 05) and LDL composition by increasing the K value (- 0. 11 +/- 0. 06 vs. - 0. 20 +/- 0. 06 during placebo, P < 0. 05). However, pioglitazone did not affect other <b>serum</b> <b>lipid</b> levels. Endothelial function, body fat distribution and IMCL were also not affected.

40|$|Objectives Serum {{levels of}} {{persistent}} organochlorine compounds may be predictive {{of their body}} burden, if adjusted by <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids.</b> Their value may be predicted by three diVerent formulae, requiring only values of serum cholesterol and triglycerides. The study was aimed at: (i) evaluating the validity of these formulae; (ii) evaluating the inXuence of diVerent estimates on serum levels of lipid adjusted persistent organochlorine compounds. Methods We determined the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids by enzymatic assays on serum samples from 121 subjects living in a polluted area of Northern Italy. On the same samples and on an additional set from 69 pregnant women of the same area, we determined also polychlorinated biphenyls, hexachlorobenzene and p,p-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene. In women, analytes were determined also on adipose tissue samples. Results Formulae provided results comparable to those obtained as sum of cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids. In women, we found highly signiWcant relationships among lipid adjusted pollutant levels in serum and adipose tissue, independently from the used formula. Conclusions Formulae allow a valid adjustment of organochlorine compounds in serum. The algorithm proposed by Phillips et al. provides some slight advantage over the others, in terms of simplicity of use...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of short-term magnesium or essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiencies on plasma lipids, platelet fatty acid composition and [1 - 14 C] arachidonic acid incorporation into platelet phospholipids. Weanling rats were fed purified diets (casein 20 %, sucrose 70. 5 %, lipid 5 %) for two weeks. The control and magnesium-deficient diets included corn oil as lipid source. The EFA-deficient diet included hydrogenated coconut oil. The fatty acid composition of serum lipids confirmed the linoleic acid deprivation in the EFA-deficient group. Significant changes in platelet fatty acid composition occurred in this limited period of time and arachidonic acid incorporation into platelet lipids was markedly increased. Magnesium deficiency induced hyperlipaemia. A significant decrease in the percentage of arachidonic acid in <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> was observed, but fatty acid profile appeared quite different in the two deficiencies. In magnesium-deficient rats, the alteration in fatty acid composition of serum lipids was not associated with similar changes in fatty acid composition of platelet lipids. Arachidonic acid incorporation into platelet lipids was markedly increased in magnesium deficient animals as compared to control group. Relatively more arachidonic acid was incorporated into phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylinositol when magnesium-deficient or EFA-deficient animals were compared to the control group...|$|E
40|$|Phyphyllanhtus amarus (Bhuiamala) is medicinally {{important}} plant. The {{literature survey}} reveals that this plant controls the adverse effect of hepatitis in human being. The extracts isolated from {{various parts of}} phyllanthus amarus and newly synthesized analogue of active ingredient i. e. phyllanthin were tested for their curative impact on cythion induced activities in albino rats with special reference to blood serum (VLDL, LDL, and HDL) hepatotoxicity. The effects of intraperitonial administration of test plant extract and snewly synthesized analogue were studied on cythion induced blood serum hepato-toxicity. The blood serum VLDL, LDL and HDL were estimated {{in order to assess}} the liver functions by established procedures. Biochemical observations were supplemented with histological examination of liver section. It is evident from the results that levels of various serum lipoproteins were altered in cythion treated animals than control group animals. There was small but significant decrease in the concentration of <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> which may largely due to the reduction of the total lipid concentration in the VLDL, LDL and HDL. However the altered lipoprotein concentration levels were restored almost to the level of their normalcy in Phyphyllanhtus amarus (Bhuiamala) and newly synthesized analogou of active ingredient i. e. phyllanthin treated animals.

40|$|An LD 50 (0. 2 mglkg) dose of Walterinnesia aegyptia venom to albino rats {{causes a}} {{significant}} decrease in <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids,</b> triacylglycerols and total cholseterol, with a decline in both glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PDH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities, possibly due to lipolytic and specific inhibitors present in the venom. Accumulation of totallipids was observed in the liver, kidneys, heart and brain of envenomated animals with a subsequent insignificant decrease in total cholesterol and triacylglycerols, except in the liver, where the decrease was significant. This suggests mobilization of lipids from peripheral tissues to these organs accompanied by release of other components of totallipids such as phospholipids and fatty acids. Deficiency in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), disturbance in the oxidoreduction system and altered energy metabolism were also detected. Variations in enzyme activities were also seen with the G 6 PDH level which generally elevated in the all organs studied, except in brain. The level of LDH declined in liver and kidney, but increased in heart and brain. This may suggest prevalence of anaerobic conditions in such organs as a result of venom detoxication.

40|$|The {{effects of}} feeding diets {{containing}} no fat, 3 % hydrogenated coconut oil (HCO) or graded levels (0. 1, 0. 5, 1. 0 or 3 %) of safflower oil (SO) on serum cholesterol, lipids and protein level; on total heart and liver cholesterol and lipid level and on growth rate and skin condition were studied in weanling Yorkshire and Yorkshire x Hampshire pigs. Pigs fed the fat-free diet for 21 weeks developed severe skin lesions not observed in pigs fed HCO diets. Highly significant elevation of serum, liver and heart lipid and liver cholesterol, {{and a highly}} significant depression of total serum protein were observed with the feeding of HCO or fat-free diets. Serum cholestrol was significantly increased by HCO {{as compared with the}} fat-free diet or diets containing SO during the repletion period. Total heart cholesterol, growth rate and erythrocyte fragility were unaffected by diets. It is concluded that growth rate is not adversely affected in the pig by fat-free diets and that HCO does not produce skin lesions in the pig characteristic of fatty acid deficiency.

40|$|The current {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effect of feeding raw egg white on growth and some blood parameters of broiler chicks. Forty one day old. Unsexed broiler chicks were used in the experiment. (Chicks were divided into two groups with 4 replicates with 5 birds per replicate). The birds were fed on 2 experimental diets, unsupplemented (diet A without raw egg white) and supplemented (diet B with 5 % egg white). All diets were kept approximately iso nitrogenous and iso caloric with essential nutrients according to the (NRC 1994) requirements for the broiler chicks. Feed and water were provided adlibitum. Feed intake and body weight were weekly recorded, also weight gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were calculated. The experiment lasted for 5 weeks. Eight birds from each treatment (2 birds/replicate) were randomly selected, weighed and slaughtered and blood was collected for serum analysis. The results demonstrated that broilers fed on diet supplemented with 5 % raw egg white showed symptom of biotin deficiency, lesion around the mouth and significant (P < 0. 01) decreased in weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio. However, total serum protein and cholesterol were not affected with feeding raw egg white, but significantly (P < 0. 01) increased <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> of broilers chick...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Little {{is known}} about the {{aetiology}} of endometriosis; however, in the presence of oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species might increase growth and adhesion of endometrial cells in the peritoneal cavity, leading to endometriosis and infertility. Within a study investigating persistent organic compounds and endometriosis, the authors evaluated the association between oxidative stress and endometriosis. METHODS: Women aged 18 – 40 years who were undergoing laparoscopy were contacted {{to participate in the study}} (n 5 100); 84 were eligible and agreed to be interviewed; 78 provided blood specimens. Four markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant status were measured in serum for 61 women. Multiple imputation of missing data was used to generate values for the missing oxidative stress data. RESULTS: Thirty-two women had visually confirmed endometriosis at laparoscopy while 52 did not, including 22 undergoing tubal ligation and 30 with idiopathic infertility. There was a weak associ-ation between thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (nmol/ml) and endometriosis, after adjusting for age, body mass index, current smoking, hormone use in the past 12 months, gravidity, serum vitamin E, serum estradiol, and <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> (b 5 1. 18; 95 % CI– 0. 04, 2. 39). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that oxidative stress might play a role in the development and progression of endometriosis, which should be evaluated in larger studies.

40|$|The {{effect of}} single dose whole body {{irradiation}} on the serum cholesterol content and fatty acid composition of <b>serum</b> <b>lipids</b> of rats was investigated. A change in fatty acid composition of liver lipid was also observed. 1) The serum cholesterol content increased in parallel {{with the increase in}} body weight. The change in cholesterol ester was more marked than that of free cholesterol. 2) After 600 rad irradiation, cholesterol content increased, reached maximum 3 days after irradiation, and then decreased. This temporary increase was due to cholesterol ester. 3) Cholesterol and triglyceride both accounted for about 40 %, as measured by color determination on thin-layer chromatography. After irradiation, an increase in cholesterol content and the marked decrease in triglyceride content were observed bringing about a change in the amount of <b>total</b> <b>serum</b> <b>lipid.</b> 4) The fatty acid composition of normal and irradiated rat sera were compared. The relative percentages of total lipid of palmitic and oleic acids decreased while those of stearic and arachidonic acid increased. Serum phospholipid had little arachidonic acid and the fatty acid composition did not change after irradiation. Serum triglyceride had trace amounts of arachidonic acid and the unsaturated fatty acid component decreased after irradiation. On the other hand, unsaturated fatty acid in cholesterol ester increased after irradiation while linoleic and arachidonic acids made up 29 % and 22 % in control and 17 % and 61 % after irradiation, respectively. These results indicate that after irradiation the amount of oleic acid decreased in all lipid fractions, and that the decrease in linoleic acid and the increase in arachidonic acid after irradiation were due mainly to changes in the amounts of the cholesterol ester of these fatty acids. 5) Fatty acid composition of total liver lipid after irradiation showed a decrease in palmitic and oleic acids and an increase in stearic and arachidonic acids, the same trend as observed in <b>serum</b> <b>lipid</b> fatty acid. Liver cholesterol ester showed trace amounts of linoleic and arachidonic acids and an increase in short chain fatty acid after irradiation. 6) The major component of serum phospholipid was phosphatidylcholine, while palmitostearyl lecithine and unsatulated fatty acid were small components. Moreover, phosphatidylcholine and -ethanolamine were the major components of liver phospholipid, having highly unsatulated fatty acids. The changes in fatty acid composition were similar to the changes in total phospholipids...|$|R
