5|$|<b>The</b> <b>converted</b> Victorious was {{commissioned}} as a repair ship on 22 February 1916 {{and arrived at}} Scapa Flow to replace <b>the</b> <b>converted</b> merchant ship Caribbean, which had been lost in September 1915, as repair ship for the Grand Fleet. Victorious performed this role there until March 1920 when she was renamed Indus II and transferred to Devonport for a refit to prepare her for service with the Indus Establishment. She arrived at Devonport on 28 March 1920 and paid off into a care and maintenance status while she awaited {{the beginning of her}} refit. Plans for the refit, however, were cancelled; work began to convert her into a harbor depot ship but, in April 1922, that conversion was cancelled before it could be completed and she was placed on the disposal list that month. Indus II was sold for scrapping on 19 December 1922, but the sale was cancelled on 1 March 1923. She was again sold on 9 April 1923 and was towed from Devonport to Dover to be scrapped.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, the {{nameplate}} {{capacity of a}} photovoltaic power stations is rated in megawatt-peak (MWp), which refers to the solar array's DC power output. However, Canada, Japan, Spain and {{some parts of the}} United States often specify using <b>the</b> <b>converted</b> lower nominal power output in MWAC; a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation. A third and less common rating is the mega volt-amperes (MVA). Most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1MWp. As at the start of 2017, the world's largest operating photovoltaic power station has a capacity of over 800 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned. As at the end of 2016, about 4,300 projects with a combined capacity of 96GWAC were solar farms larger than 4MWAC.|$|E

The guns and other usable equipment were salvaged from the wreck starting the following day. The guns were converted into field artillery pieces and coastal guns; {{together with the}} ship's crew, {{they went on to}} see service in the East African land campaign under Lettow-Vorbeck. All ten guns were repaired in Dar es Salaam over the next two months; one was mounted on <b>the</b> <b>converted</b> ferry Götzen of the inland Lake Tanganyika fleet. The surviving sailors, organized as the Königsberg-Abteilung (Königsberg-Detachment), eventually surrendered on 26 November 1917 and were interned in British Egypt.

5|$|A second variant on the Tetrarch {{design was}} the Tetrarch Duplex Drive ("Tetrarch DD"). The Duplex Drive system {{was invented by}} Nicholas Straussler, and was {{designed}} to allow a tank to 'swim' through water and participate in amphibious operations. The system functioned by erecting a large waterproof canvas screen around the tank above its tracks, which was supported by thirty-six inflatable tubes and steel struts; this gave the tank sufficient buoyancy to float, and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank's engine. The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land. The system was fitted during June 1941, as the Tetrarch was the lightest light tank available at the time; <b>the</b> <b>converted</b> tank was successfully tested {{on a number of}} lakes and reservoirs, allowing the Duplex Drive system to be tested on heavier tanks, such as the Valentine. The system would be used during Operation Overlord, when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches.|$|E
5|$|Another legend {{tells the}} story of {{conversion}} of Chamunda into a Jain goddess. According to this story, Chamunda sculpted the Mahavira image for the temple in Osian, Jodhpur and was happy with the conversions of the Oswals to Jainism. At the time of Navratri, a festival that celebrates the Divine Mother, Chamunda expected animal sacrifices from <b>the</b> <b>converted</b> Jains. The vegetarian Jains, however, were unable to meet her demand. Ratnaprabhasuri intervened, and as a result, Chamunda accepted vegetarian offerings, forgoing her demand for meat and liquor. Ratnaprabhsuri further named her Sacciya, one who had told the truth, as Chamunda had told him the truth that a rainy season stay in Osian would be beneficial for him. She also became the protective goddess of the temple and remained the clan goddess, Kuladevi, of the Oswals. The Sachiya Mata Temple in Osian was built in her honour. Some Jain scriptures warn of dire consequences of worship of Chamunda by the Hindu rites and rituals.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{consensus}} regarding the exact import of the inscription, scholars seem to agree that its language is some form of Gothic and that the intent behind it was religious. Taylor interprets the inscription as being clearly pagan in nature and indicative {{of the existence of}} a temple to which the ring was a votive offering. He derives his date for the burial (210 to 250) {{from the fact that the}} Christianizing of the Goths along the Danube is generally considered to have been almost complete within a few generations after their having arrived there in 238. Though paganism among the Goths did survive the initial conversion phase of 250 to 300 - as the martyring of <b>the</b> <b>converted</b> Christian Goths Wereka, Batwin (370) and Sabbas (372) at the hands of the indigenously pagan Goths (in the latter case Athanaric) shows - it was weakened considerably in the following years, and the likelihood of such a deposit being made would have been greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|In late May {{and early}} June 1942, during World War II, {{submarines}} {{belonging to the}} Imperial Japanese Navy {{made a series of}} attacks on the cities of Sydney and Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia. On the night of 31 May – 1 June, three Ko-hyoteki-class midget submarines, each with a two-member crew, entered Sydney Harbour, avoided the partially constructed Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net, and attempted to sink Allied warships. Two of the midget submarines were detected and attacked before they could successfully engage any Allied vessels, and the crews scuttled their boats and killed themselves. These submarines were later recovered by the Allies. The third submarine attempted to torpedo the heavy cruiser , but instead sank <b>the</b> <b>converted</b> ferry HMAS Kuttabul, killing 21 sailors.

40|$|M. A. (Clinical Psychology) Adult {{religious}} conversion is an atypical {{religious experience}} with multiple {{social and psychological}} meanings for <b>the</b> <b>convert.</b> Four adult religious converts were interviewed to explore and describe their perspectives of their interpersonal relationships during the conversion process. These transcribed interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis within a case study design from a Critical Realist paradigm. <b>The</b> <b>converts</b> viewed conversion as a path to a preferred way of life with nine themes identified (romance with the religiously wayward, esteem for a religious sage, acceptance, gaining a new religious family, new religion aids relationships, life transitions, commonality maintains alt-religious relationships, diverse family dynamics, and altreligious relationships ending). Further interpretation integrated these themes within three relational processes that engage religious conversion through disrupting <b>the</b> <b>convert’s</b> religious status quo, maintaining relational stability conducive to conversion, and attracting <b>the</b> <b>convert</b> toward <b>the</b> new religion. These relational dynamic processes explore the texture and express the subtleties of relationships during the religious conversion process...|$|R

5|$|Sections of {{the track}} were removed and relaid at other {{athletics}} venues, and the internal ground level was lowered {{to make way for}} an additional tier of seating, on terracing already constructed then buried for the original configuration. The three temporary stands with a total capacity of 16,000 were dismantled, and replaced with a permanent structure of similar design to the existing one at the southern end. This work took nearly a year to complete and added 23,000 permanent seats, increasing the capacity of <b>the</b> <b>converted</b> stadium by 7,000 to approximately 48,000. Manchester City F.C. moved to the ground in time {{for the start of the}} 2003–04 season. The total cost of this conversion was in excess of £40 million, with the track, pitch and seating conversion being funded by the city council at a cost of £22million; and the installation of bars, restaurants and corporate entertainment areas throughout the stadium being funded by the football club at a cost of £20million. The Games had made a small operating surplus, and Sport England agreed that this could be reinvested in converting the athletics warm-up track adjacent to the main stadium into the 6,000 seat Manchester Regional Arena at a cost of £3.5 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{capsizing}} of {{the battleship}} Novorossiysk in Sevastopol harbor on 29 October 1955 delayed salvage operations on Stalingrad {{until the end}} of the year. The hull had to be patched, the water pumped out and all the projections removed to raise the stern slightly with pontoons, pivot into deeper water, then trim it down to elevate the bow off the bottom and pull it free. These preparations were very time-consuming and it wasn't until mid-July 1956 that it could be pulled off the rocks into Sevastopol harbor where she was given more permanent repairs. She was then moved to the Naval Firing Range between Yevpatoria and Sevastopol where it was used as a target for seven P-1 or KSS anti-ship missiles fired from <b>the</b> <b>converted</b> Sverdlov-class cruiser Admiral Nakhimov in December 1956. The missiles penetrated the upper and main decks and devastated the upper hull, but there was no appreciable change in the ship's draught. Details are not known about other tests, although she reportedly served as a target for P-15 Termit (SS-N-2 Styx) missiles and a wide variety of armor-piercing munitions. By the early 1960s her usefulness had come to an end and she was scrapped, possibly in 1962.|$|E

Changes in naval technology dictated other alterations as well: installation of air search radar sets and antennas; upgraded radio equipment; an armored fighter director cabin mounted on the main mast (which in turn meant a heavier, sturdier mast to accommodate the cabin's added weight); extra armoring for the bridge and fire control center; a new curved funnel cap to shield the fighter director cabin from smoke; replacing the single-mount 20mm AA guns with quadruple Flakvierling 38 guns (with a corresponding increase in ammunition supply) to improve overall AA defense; and additional bulges {{on either side of}} the hull to preserve the ship's stability under all this added weight.|$|E
