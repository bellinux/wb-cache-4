From 19 May, Channel 4 began uploading teaser clips to the official Big Brother UK YouTube channel; these were also aired during commercial breaks on Channel 4 and its related channels. The series was sponsored by Lucozade Energy and the promotional break bumpers were created by M Saatchi and are based upon a 'little brother versus big brother' scenario. The programme began on 4 June, with a 95-minute special programme which introduced the initial 16 participants, and was broadcast on Channel 4 and E4 over a period of 93 days, concluding with the final on 4 September.|$|E

25|$|In {{imperial}} China, clerks used an abbreviated, highly cursive form of Chinese {{characters to}} record court proceedings and criminal confessions. These records {{were used to}} create more formal transcripts. One cornerstone of imperial court proceedings was that all confessions had to be acknowledged by the accused's signature, personal seal, or <b>thumbprint,</b> requiring fast writing. Versions of this technique survived in clerical professions into the modern day, and influenced by Western shorthand methods, some new methods were invented.|$|E
25|$|For those reasons, law {{enforcement}} now attempts to apprehend suspected cybercriminals with their computers on and in use, all accounts {{both on the}} computer and online open and logged in, thus easily searchable. If they do not succeed in seizing the computer in that condition, there are some methods available to bypass password protection, but these may take more time than police have available. Nor may it be legally possible to compel the suspect to relinquish his or her password—in the United States, where many computer-crime investigations take place, courts have distinguished between forcing a suspect to use material means of protecting data such as a <b>thumbprint,</b> retinal scan or key {{as opposed to a}} password or passcode, which is purely the product of the suspect's mental processes and is thus protected from compelled disclosure by the Fifth Amendment.|$|E
25|$|In October 2013, an Oklahoma {{crime lab}} began re-examining {{fingerprints}} taken from scenes of unsolved murders. In February 2014, Creek's case was reopened; examiners in an Oklahoma crime lab {{were able to}} match a <b>thumbprint</b> on the garbage bag concealing the body to James Paul Eaton, a 36-year-old divorced man. Eaton was nineteen {{at the time of}} the murder and lived in Palatine, Illinois, the same town as Creek. One of the men seen with Amber in early February 1997 bore a strong resemblance to Eaton. Eaton's fingerprints were not on record {{at the time of the}} murder, recorded only in 2000 after his arrest for possession of drug paraphernalia. Investigators located the suspect in Chicago, and on March 22 collected discarded cigarette butts to match his DNA to that found at the crime scene. Eaton was subsequently arrested in early April and is currently incarcerated in Racine, Wisconsin. Authorities also looked though his computer, Facebook profile and phone, as well as searching his residence for possible souvenirs from the scene, as some of Amber's belongings had been suspected to have been taken by her killer.|$|E
40|$|Unwelcome {{intrusions}} into {{computer systems}} are being perpetrated by strangers, {{and the number}} of such incidents is rising steadily. One of the things that facilitates this malfeasance is that computer networks provide the ability for a user to log into multiple computer systems in sequence, changing identity with each step. This makes it very difficult to trace actions on a network of computers {{all the way back to}} their actual origins. We refer to this as the tracing problem. This thesis attempts to address this problem by the development of a technology called <b>thumbprinting.</b> <b>Thumbprinting</b> involves forming a signature of the data in a network connection. This signature is a small quantity which does not allow complete reconstruction of the data, but does allow comparison with signatures of other connections to determine with reasonable confidence whether the data were the same or not. This is a potential basis for a tracing system. The specific technology developed to perform this task is local <b>thumbprinting.</b> This involves forming linear combinations of the frequencies with which different characters occur in the network data sampled. The optimal linear combinations are chosen using a statistical methodology called principal component analysis. The difficulties which this process must overcome are outlined, and an algorithm for comparing the <b>thumbprints</b> which adaptively handles these difficulties is presented. A number of experiments with a trial implementation of this method are described. The method is shown to work successfully when given at least a minute and a half of reasonably active network connection. This requires presently about 20 bytes per iv minute per connection of storage for the <b>thumbprints.</b> In addition, the existing (very limited) literature on th [...] ...|$|R

500|$|Before {{leaving town}} after Congress adjourned in March 1865, Stevens privately urged Lincoln {{to press the}} South hard militarily, though the war was ending. [...] Lincoln replied, [...] "Stevens, {{this is a pretty}} big hog we are trying to catch and to hold when we catch him. [...] We must take care that he does not slip away from us." [...] Never to see Lincoln again, Stevens left with [...] "a homely metaphor but no real {{certainty}} of having left as much as a <b>thumbprint</b> on Lincoln's policy.” On the evening of April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. [...] Stevens did not attend the ceremonies when Lincoln's funeral train stopped in Lancaster; he was said to be ill. Trefousse speculated he may avoided the rites for other reasons. [...] According to Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg, Stevens stood at a railroad bridge and lifted his hat.|$|E
500|$|Farmers holding grain {{ingested}} it instead, {{since their}} own planting had been completed. Distribution was hurried and open, with grain being distributed {{free of charge}} or with payment in kind. Some farmers sold their own grain lest this new grain devalue what they had. This left them dependent on tainted grain for the winter. Many Iraqis were either unaware of the significant health risk posed, or chose to ignore the warnings. [...] Initially, farmers were to certify with a <b>thumbprint</b> or signature that they understood the grain was poison, but according to some sources, distributors {{did not ask for}} such an indication. Warnings on the sacks were in Spanish and English, not at all understood, or included the black-and-white skull and crossbones design, which meant nothing to Iraqis. The long latent period may have granted farmers a false sense of security, when animals fed the grain appeared to be fine. The red dye washed off the grain; the mercury did not. Hence, washing may have given only the appearance of removing the poison.|$|E

Feng later told All Girls Allowed, an American group campaigning against the one-child policy, [...] "I could feel the baby jumping around inside me all the time, but then she went still." [...] She had been seven months pregnant at the time, so the abortion, voluntary or not, was illegal under Chinese law. No family members were allowed to be present for the procedure. After the child died of hypoxia, Feng underwent induced labor and delivered a stillborn girl on June 4. Feng later told All Girls Allowed: [...] "It was much more painful than my first childbirth. The baby was lifeless, and she was all purple and blue." [...] The corpse was then placed next to Feng on her bed for her family to dispose of when they arrived.|$|E
500|$|After the two magicians {{make their}} exit, {{confident}} in the lack of evidence against them, Mulder reveals to Scully the true trick being performed—that everything involving Alvarez was purely misdirection. Earlier, when checking whether Pinchbeck had stolen funds from the bank, the manager had told Mulder they would need his badge number and thumb print {{to gain access to}} the Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) system. Mulder shows Scully Maleeni's wallet, which he had collected from evidence before confronting him and LaBonge. When the agents first met LaBonge, he had surreptitiously pickpocketed their badges as an example of his skill with sleight of hand, which gave him Mulder's badge number. Upon their first meeting with Pinchbeck impersonating his brother, Pinchbeck did a card trick with Mulder, leaving Mulder's prints on the card, which as Mulder displays, is securely in Maleeni's wallet. Mulder explains that the pair purposely acted in a high-profile manner to draw the attention of the FBI, and that if they had collected the badge number and <b>thumbprint,</b> they would have been able to perform EFTs. As Mulder and Scully leave the jail, Scully shows that she, too, has learned a trick, and turns her hand around 360 degrees in a similar fashion to what LaBonge did with his hand. Mulder asks Scully to explain how, and she brushes him off, saying simply [...] "magic".|$|E

[...] On Meet the Press, Kaine stated: [...] "I'm a strong supporter that the U.S. should take action to protect humanitarian causes, like the ban on chemical weapons. Where I differ from this administration, and I took the same position with respect to President Obama, we are a nation that's not supposed to take military action, start war, without a plan that's presented to and approved by Congress." ...|$|E
