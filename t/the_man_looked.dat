500|$|The {{original}} Leigh Court was an Elizabethan mansion {{built by}} Sir George Norton. His great-great-grandson, also George Norton (born 1622), unknowingly hosted Charles II, who {{arrived at the}} house the evening of 12 September 1651, during his escape to France following the Battle of Worcester. The Nortons were friends of the Kings's travelling companion, Jane Lane. The Nortons were unaware of the King's identity during his three-day stay. While staying at Leigh Court and after being recognised by the elderly butler, who had served the King when a young Prince at Richmond, Charles deflected suspicion by asking a trooper, {{who had been in}} the King's personal guard, to describe the King's appearance and clothing at the Battle of Worcester. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>looked</b> at Charles and said, [...] "The King was at least three inches taller than you."

2500|$|On Thursday 11 September, they {{continued}} through Chipping Campden {{and then to}} Cirencester, where it is claimed they spent the night of 11 September at the Crown Inn. The next morning they travelled on to Chipping Sodbury and then to Bristol, arriving at Abbots Leigh {{on the evening of}} 12 September. They stayed at the home of Mr and Mrs George Norton, who were also Janeâ€™s friends. The Nortons were unaware of the King's identity during his three-day stay at Abbotsleigh. While staying there Charles deflected suspicion by asking a servant, {{who had been in the}} King's personal guard at the Battle of Worcester, to describe the King's appearance and clothing at the battle. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>looked</b> at Charles and said, [...] "The King was at least three fingers taller than [...]" ...|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man,</b> <b>looking</b> fixedly to seaward, {{smiled at}} the ardour of her tone.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>looked</b> at each other, {{and one of}} them {{turned to}} Stirling.|$|R
60|$|With consternation {{depicted}} on their haggard countenances <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>looked</b> at <b>the</b> guide.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>looked</b> his gratitude. He, at least, {{was willing}} enough.|$|E
60|$|George {{gave him}} a brief explanation, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>looked</b> about.|$|E
60|$|George {{gave their}} names, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>looked</b> at his time-book.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>looked</b> {{at their}} leader, whom they evidently {{expected}} to be their spokesman.|$|R
60|$|Then {{some one}} of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>looked</b> out of <b>the</b> door and {{suddenly}} whistled.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>looked</b> at {{each other}} wonderingly, as he took his candle and left them.|$|R

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>looked</b> around, each {{trying to}} hide his fear, and then a regular search was begun.|$|R
60|$|All <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>looked</b> at Charlotte, {{on whose}} face a {{delicate}} nervous blush thereupon made its appearance.|$|R
60|$|Lancelot {{burst out}} laughing. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>looked</b> {{up at him}} slowly and seriously.|$|E

60|$|They sat them down, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>looking</b> on from afar, and Mulvaney untangled {{himself in}} mighty words.|$|R
60|$|The two leadys {{approached}} warily. Without speaking, {{they stopped}} close by <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> <b>looking</b> {{them up and}} down.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>looked</b> up hastily as Fred entered, and {{uttered a}} few unintelligible words.|$|E
60|$|Mr Boffin looked full at the man, and <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>looked</b> full at him.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>looked</b> at {{her with}} an {{expression}} as if her words had pained him.|$|E

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>men</b> <b>looked</b> {{once again}} at each other, nodded, laughed, {{and sat down}} on a log beside the fire, {{opposite}} to the Englishmen.|$|R
