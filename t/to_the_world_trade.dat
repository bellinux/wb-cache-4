5|$|Following the {{destruction}} of the original World Trade Center, there was debate regarding the future of the World Trade Center site. There were proposals for its reconstruction almost immediately, and by 2002, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation had organized a competition to determine how to use the site. The proposals were part of a larger plan to memorialize the September 11 attacks and rebuild the complex. When the public rejected the first round of designs, a second, more open competition took place in December 2002, in which a design by Daniel Libeskind was selected as the winner. This design underwent many revisions, mainly because of disagreements with developer Larry Silverstein, who held the lease <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center site at that time.|$|E
5|$|The New York City Fire Department {{deployed}} 200 units (half of the department) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center. Their {{efforts were}} supplemented by numerous off-duty firefighters and emergency medical technicians. The New York City Police Department sent Emergency Service Units and other police personnel, and deployed its aviation unit. Once on the scene, the FDNY, the NYPD, and the PAPD did not coordinate efforts and performed redundant searches for civilians. As conditions deteriorated, the NYPD aviation unit relayed information to police commanders, who issued orders for its personnel {{to evacuate the}} towers; most NYPD officers were able to safely evacuate before the buildings collapsed. With separate command posts set up and incompatible radio communications between the agencies, warnings were not passed along to FDNY commanders.|$|E

The proposal is intended as a challenge <b>to</b> members of <b>the</b> WTO <b>to</b> improve market access through “ambitious tariff reduction” and to “move aggressively” to cut trade-distorting domestic support (Portman, 2005). Although the major parameters of the proposal are yet to be defined, these steps seem consistent with commitments made by WTO participating countries to move agricultural trade negotiations forward in the framework agreement of July 2004.

5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated {{at that time that}} Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
5|$|Two major {{projects}} are being undertaken {{on the southern}} portion of the line: the rebuilding of the Cortlandt Street station, and the rebuilding of the new South Ferry terminal. Following the September 11 attacks, the Cortlandt Street station was destroyed, and as a result, is being completely rebuilt with a new connection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Trade</b> Center PATH station. In 2009, a new station at South Ferry opened to replace the old South Ferry loop station. The new station, a two-terminal, was intended to increase capacity and to save travel times. However, just three years later it closed {{as a result of}} Hurricane Sandy, which completely flooded the station. The loop station was temporarily open to serve the area, but it closed in June 2017 when the newer station reopened.|$|E
