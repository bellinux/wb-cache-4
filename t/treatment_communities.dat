40|$|The {{authors of}} Chapter 12 (Cavatassi et al.) {{performed}} an ex-post evaluation using econometric techniques common in impact evaluations. They assessed whether participation in Ecuador’s Plataformas program, which establishes alliances between small-scale farmers {{and a range}} of agricultural support-service providers, had any effect on income. The chapter finds that the program had a positive impact on yields, prices, and gross margins. The authors conducted baseline household and community surveys in two Ecuadorean provinces and then identified <b>treatment</b> <b>communities.</b> Using data from the most recent census, they constructed a counterfactual control group with similar geographical, agroecological, and sociodemographic characteristics to the <b>treatment</b> <b>communities.</b> They then used PSM to identify which control communities were most similar to each treatment community. In addition to creating control communities, they also factored in households in <b>treatment</b> <b>communities</b> that did not participate in the program. The PSM procedure allowed the authors to select a control community that was very similar to each treatment community in all observable aspects except for the treatment status, thus providing a proper counterfactual for each treatment community.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the disease model of {{alcoholism}} has lost its status as paradigm in international circles, the alcoholism research and <b>treatment</b> <b>community</b> in the United States maintains steadfast allegiance to the tenets of the disease model. The disease model and the related treatment goal of abstinence continue to overwhelmingly dominate the treatment of alcoholism in the U. S. Critics have suggested that financial and political motives have served to maintain the dominance of the disease model, despite findings that violate its basic tenets. This paper presents an alternative explanation of the reluctance of the alcoholism <b>treatment</b> <b>community</b> to relinquish the disease model by utilizing Kuhn 2 ̆ 7 s (1996) model of scientific progress in an historical analysis of the disease model. To support this position, evidence of the emergence of the disease model as a paradigm, alcoholism research as normal science, and the appearance of anomaly followed by crisis in the alcoholism research and <b>treatment</b> <b>community</b> are presented...|$|R

It uses {{data from a}} program that randomly assigned communities to treatment and control and paid transfers to poor households in <b>treatment</b> <b>communities.</b> The randomization implies that differences in consumption between control and treatment households are due to the program. A buffer-stock model predicts how the response of consumption to transfers depends on the discount factor.

Nicaragua’s CCT, the Red de Protección Social (RPS), had a short life span (2000 – 2006). Nonetheless, the programme received international acclaim for its achievements. The RPS regularly directed funds to female household heads conditional on the households’ fulfilment of certain co-responsibilities (or conditionalities, as they were known until recently). These included children’s school attendance, medical check-ups at local health centres and mothers’ participation in educational sessions. Evaluation of RPS’s first phase found that it had significantly increased school enrolment and other education indicators (Maluccio and Flores, 2005).

40|$|We {{believe that}} the {{engineering}} of wastewater treatment systems would be improved if we could predict and manipulate the composition, that is, the diversity of such systems.

In this paper we point to important phenomena in wastewater treatment, such as acclimation, adaptation and functional redundancy that would benefit from the ability to confidently design diversity. We set out a rationale and a mathematical framework for a stochastic approach to the design of diversity and show that, in principle, this approach works with two important functional groups in wastewater treatment.
