40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{verify the}} {{correlation}} between overweight and socioeconomic and demographic indicators among Brazilian adults, {{using data from the}} Brazilian Household Budget Survey from 2008 / 2009.

RESULTS: The featured profile of <b>the</b> Brazilian <b>adult</b> <b>population</b> with regard to overweight was correlated with ages from 30 years of the most developed and economically social geographic regions of Brazil; however between genders, the correlation was in the opposite direction in the variables income, education, and subjective issues about life conditions related to food and nutrition security.
