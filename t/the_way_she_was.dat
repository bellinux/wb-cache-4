Along <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> refueled with coal at Saint Lucia in the British West Indies and at Coronel in Chile. The Chilean coal was often of lesser quality which burned too quickly and dangerously sent sparks flying from the ship's funnel; the quality and fire danger were key reasons that all subsequent American-Hawaiian ships used oil instead of coal for fuel.|$|E

The general agreement was that Pari Khan Khanum had resolved to have poisoned {{with the help of the}} mistresses of the inner harem in retaliation for his bad behaviour towards her. With Ismail II out of the way, Pari Khan Khanum regained her authority and control. Every state grandee, clan chieftains, officers and officials carried out the orders delivered by her deputies and served according to her word.|$|E
25|$|Mary Hanford Ford (November 1, 1856 – February 2, 1937) was an American lecturer, author, art and {{literature}} critic and {{a leader in the}} women's suffrage movement. She reached early notoriety in Kansas at the age of 28 and soon left for the Chicago World's Fair. She was taken up by the society ladies of the Chicago area who, impressed with her talks on art {{and literature}} at the Fair, helped launch her on a new career, initially in Chicago and then across some States. Along <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> already published in articles and noticed in suffrage meetings. In addition to work as an art critic and speaker she wrote a number of books, most prominently a trilogy Message of the Mystics. Circa 1900-1902 Ford found the Bahá'í Faith through Sarah Farmer, Green Acre, and Mirza Abu'l-Fadl, and helped form the first community of Bahá'ís in Boston where Louis Bourgeois, future architect of the first Bahá'í House of Worship in the West, then joined the religion. In 1907 Ford went on Bahá'í pilgrimage, in 1910 she started writing Bahá'í books such as The Oriental Rose, and traveled with `Abdu'l-Bahá during some of his journeys in various places in Europe and then America. Ford was blamed for a fiasco among UK suffragists but it was their own violence that got them in trouble. Ford spent the years of World War I in California following the first Bahá'í International Congress at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition, and then moved back to New York where she spent almost the next 20 years. Often she traveled to Europe for some months of the year and during this period introduced the religion to Ugo Giachery, later a prominent Bahá'í. Also in this period she was censored off a radio broadcast, helped develop the religion's community both in meetings she supported and literary efforts, before reducing her travels and speaking engagements in the early 1930s. She died with her daughter by her bedside in 1937.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} episode a [...] "C", {{feeling that the}} [...] "interesting concept" [...] of the psychic {{photographs}} were ruined by [...] "boilerplate Scully-in-distress shtick".

He felt that its [...] "greatest virtue" [...] was being terrifying and that it worked for being an [...] "urban fairytale". However, he also criticized it for putting Scully in danger. Sarah Stegall awarded the episode four stars out of five, praising the writing by Gilligan, who she commented was [...] "genius for tight confrontation scenes", complimenting the atmosphere and presentation of the episode. She criticized the final scene featuring Scully tied up with duct-tape, commenting that <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> loosely tied up was unrealistic.

The two {{had been living in}} a high-end Miami hotel, but around 2003 she moved out into her own place in that city. Hill later said that she and Marley [...] "have had long periods of separation over the years".

500|$|In January 2015 a {{transgender}} Jewish woman, Kay Long, {{was denied}} access to the Wall, first by the women's section {{and then by the}} men's section. Long's presence was prevented by [...] "modesty police" [...] at women’s section who are not associated with the rabbi of the Western Wall or the site administration. They are a group of female volunteers who guard the entrance to the women’s section preventing entry to visitors who are not dressed to their idea of Orthodox modesty standards for women. The director of Jerusalem’s Open House, a community center for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, noted that Long’s experience was not unique.

500|$|In October {{she started}} the 2-5 {{favorite}} for the Zenyatta Stakes at Santa Anita. After leading for most of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> headed in the final furlong and beaten a neck by Stellar Wind with the pair finishing more than eleven lengths clear {{of the other three}} runners. On November 4, in what was scheduled to be her final racecourse appearance before her retirement, Beholder made her first appearance in the Breeders' Cup since 2013 when she once again contested the Distaff at Santa Anita. Stellar Wind was again challenging, but the odds-on favorite was the undefeated three-year-old Songbird. Beholder, coming off three losses, was third in the betting odds. From the outside post position of the eight-horse field, Beholder tracked the leaders before moving alongside Songbird on the final turn. The pair engaged in a prolonged struggle in the straight before Beholder prevailed by a scant nose in a photo-finish. Stevens described the race by saying, [...] "I've been in battles before, but never the length of the stretch [...] [...] [...] definitely {{a quarter of a mile}} of just a street fight." [...] With her win, she tied Goldikova as one of only two horses to have ever won three Breeders' Cup Championships in the history of the series.|$|E
500|$|The {{accuracy}} of Boys Don't Cry was disputed by real-life {{people involved in}} the murder. The real Lana Tisdel declared her dislike for the film; she said Brandon never proposed to her and that when she discovered the truth about Brandon's sex, she ended the relationship and left him. Tisdel disliked <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> portrayed in the film, and called the film the [...] "second murder of Brandon Teena". Before the film's theatrical release, Lana Tisdel sued the film's producers, claiming that the film depicted her as [...] "lazy, white trash and a skanky snake" [...] and that her family and friends had come to see her as [...] "a lesbian who did nothing to stop a murder". [...] Tisdel said the film falsely portrayed her continuing her relationship with Teena after she discovered he was transgender. Tisdel settled her lawsuit against Fox Searchlight for an undisclosed sum. Sarah Nissen, cousin of perpetrator Marvin Nissen, was also critical of the film, saying, [...] "There's none of it that's right. It was just weird." [...] Leslie Tisdel, Lana's sister, called the film [...] "a lie of a movie". Leslie {{was not included in the}} film, and her ties with the third victim, Phillip DeVine, were omitted due to storyline constraints.|$|E

2500|$|Most of the Shirley Temple {{films were}} inexpensively made at $200,000 or $300,000 per picture and were comedy-dramas with songs and dances added, sentimental and melodramatic situations, and {{little in the}} way of {{production}} values. Her film titles are a clue to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> marketed—Curly Top and Dimples, and her [...] "little" [...] pictures such as The Little Colonel and The Littlest Rebel. Shirley often played a fixer-upper, a precocious Cupid, or the good fairy in these films, reuniting her estranged parents or smoothing out the wrinkles in the romances of young couples. Elements of the traditional fairy tale were woven into her films: wholesome goodness triumphing over meanness and evil, for example, or wealth over poverty, marriage over divorce, or a booming economy over a depressed one. As the girl matured into a pre-adolescent, the formula was altered slightly to encourage her naturalness, naïveté, and tomboyishness to come forth and shine while her infant innocence, which had served her well at six but was inappropriate for her tweens (or later childhood years), was toned down.|$|E
2500|$|Monáe later {{appeared}} on OutKast's album Idlewild, {{where she is}} featured on the songs [...] "Call the Law" [...] and [...] "In Your Dreams".

Combs soon visited Monáe's MySpace page and according to a HitQuarters interview with Bad Boy Records A person Daniel 'Skid' Mitchell, Combs loved it straight away: [...] " [...] loved her look, loved that you couldn't see her body, loved <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> dancing, and just loved the vibe. He felt like she has something that was different – something new and fresh." [...] Monáe signed to Bad Boy in 2006. The label's chief role was in facilitating her exposure on a much broader scale rather than developing the artist and her music, because {{in the words of}} Mitchell, [...] "She was already moving, she already had her records – she had a self-contained movement." [...] Combs and Big Boi wanted to take their time and build her profile organically and allow the music to grow rather than put out [...] "a hot single which everyone jumps on, and then they fade because it's just something of the moment".|$|E
2500|$|She had {{two films}} {{released}} in 1970: the Telugu film Amma Kosam and the Hindi film Sawan Bhadon, which was considered her acting debut in Bollywood. She {{had to learn}} Hindi, as that was not her naturally spoken language. Sawan Bhadon became a hit, and Rekha – a star overnight. Despite {{the success of the}} film, she was often scorned for her looks. She subsequently got several offers but nothing of substance, as her roles were mostly just of a glamour girl. She appeared in several commercially successful films at the time, including Raampur Ka Lakshman (1972), Kahani Kismat Ki (1973), and Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye (1974), yet she was not regarded for her acting abilities and—according to Tejaswini Ganti—"the industry was surprised by her success as her dark complexion, plump figure, and garish clothing contradicted the norms of beauty prevalent in the film industry and in society." [...] Rekha recalls that <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> perceived at that time motivated her to change her appearance and improve her choice of roles: [...] "I was called the ‘Ugly Duckling’ of Hindi films because of my dark complexion and South Indian features. I used to feel deeply hurt when people compared me with the leading heroines of the time and said I was no match for them. I was determined to make it big on sheer merit." ...|$|E

2500|$|During Nancy's {{relationship}} with Jake Dean, Nancy's character was rapidly transformed {{due to her}} abuse {{at the hands of}} Jake. Fox told a journalist from OK! that when the relationship begins Jake is [...] "very controlling" [...] towards Nancy and he takes away [...] "all the things that made Nancy Nancy – <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> opinionated and outspoken". She explained that during the storyline Nancy acts out of character which she found challenging to portray. She added that Nancy's abuse at the hands of Jake is psychological abuse rather than physical abuse. Sacre explained that Nancy wants to call off the wedding but Jake [...] "dismisses her concerns and insists the wedding goes ahead. He's kind of bulldozing his way through it all". He added that Jake Nancy still does not feel the wedding is right after he makes the arrangements but Jake still [...] "keeps on pushing and pushing and she gives in". Sacre said that Nancy regrets marrying Jake as soon as she has gone through with the wedding. Jake [...] "ends up trying to force himself on her on their wedding night". Sacre commented that in reaction to this Jake [...] "plays the victim and tries to blame Nancy for what's happened". The actor revealed that while Jake is in [...] "a desperate state" [...] he accidentally tells Nancy that he made allegations that she was having a sexual {{relationship with}} a pupil. Nancy is [...] "incensed", and Fox explained that this revelation is the [...] "final straw" [...] for Nancy who declares the marriage is over as this admission [...] "really shows Jake’s true colours" [...] to her. Fox stated that she and the production team were careful not to have the character return to her previous self, saying: [...] "We've tried really hard to make sure that Nancy didn't just snap back into her old self after the whole Jake incident last year. There's always a bit of darkness with her. That's something that really annoys me in soap, when something really dramatic happens to a character and they forget about it a couple of weeks later".|$|E

In finale episodes [...] "The Stolen Earth" [...] and [...] "Journey's End", Donna touches the Doctor's energised severed hand and is imbued with the totality of his knowledge, using which, she is able to stop Davros (Julian Bleach) and his plan to destroy reality. However, because her mind cannot handle the knowledge, the Doctor is forced to wipe her memory of him against her wishes when she tries to begs him not to send her back <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> and hope that they never meet again, lest she remember and her mind [...] "burn up".
