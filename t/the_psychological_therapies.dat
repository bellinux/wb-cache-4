40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} supervisors’ perceptions of the relationship between supervision and therapeutic outcomes in <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>therapies.</b> Research investigating the contribution of supervision to therapeutic outcomes is limited and often methodologically weak (e. g. Freitas, 2002; Inman & Ladany, 2008; Watkins, 2011 b; Wheeler & Richards, 2007 a, 2007 b). Watkins (2011 b) identified only three methodologically robust research studies in this area in a period spanning thirty years, from 1981 to 2011 and only one of the three was situated within <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>therapies</b> (Bambling, King, Raue, Schweitzer, & Lambert, 2006). This qualitative study used a constructivist version of Grounded Theory to analyse the data collected from individual semi-structured interviews with ten participants, and a focus group with three participants. All participants were experienced supervisors and qualified psychological therapists based in the South West of the UK. Findings suggest that supervisors perceive the relationship between supervision and therapeutic outcomes to be indirect and that enabling the supervisee to become a better therapist is how supervision is perceived to indirectly contribute to improved outcomes for the supervisee’s clients. A number of issues emerged from the findings including difficulties in finding a common language for the term ‘therapeutic outcome’ and difficulty in ascertaining supervisory responsibility for therapeutic outcome, particularly where the supervisor did not have the ‘full picture’ of the supervisee’s caseload. These findings are captured in the core connecting category, which is conceptualised as ‘making sense of paradox and inconsistency in an indirect relationship between supervision and therapeutic outcomes’. An explanatory theory of the relationship between supervision and therapeutic outcomes, together with a diagrammatic theoretical model, is presented and recommendations for supervision practice and supervisor training in <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>therapies</b> are proposed. The study concludes that future research investigating the efficacy of supervision and its influence on client outcomes should first take account of supervisors’ frame of reference in relation to client outcomes and its application in supervision practice...|$|E

40|$|The {{consideration}} of psychoanalytic issues presents geography and geographers {{with a number}} of difficulties; this paper examines those difficulties from within a humanistic perspective. The most common geographical engagements with <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>therapies</b> have been with their psychodynamic and, to a lesser extent, humanist methodological forms. A humanist perspective on this engagement suggests that it has led to two associated problems.

This essay proposes that a commitment to an engaged, 'congruent' listening might help temper these difficulties...|$|E

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{was conducted}} on 61 treatment outcome trials for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Conditions included drug therapies (TCAs, carbamazepine, MAOIs, SSRIs, and BDZs), psychological therapies (behaviour therapy, Eye-Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), relaxation training, hypnotherapy, and dynamic therapy), and control conditions (pill placebo, wait-list controls, supportive psychotherapies, and non-saccade EMDR control). Psychological therapies had significantly lower drop-out rates than pharmacotherapies (14 % versus 32 %), with attrition being uniformly low across all psychological therapies. In terms of symptom reduction, psychological therapies were more effective than drug therapies, and both were more effective than controls. Among the drug therapies, the SSRIs and carbamazepine had the greatest effect sizes, although the latter was based upon a single trial. Among <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>therapies,</b> behaviour therapy and EMDR were most effective, and generally equally so.

Results: Key figures believe that RCTs will continue to play a decisive role in determining which psychological interventions are recommended and commissioned within the NHS for the foreseeable future. Other methods are seen as having some validity, but are generally considered supplementary to RCTs and not a replacement for them. Discussion: Although many members of the counselling community are critical of RCTs, they are likely to remain the mainstay of commissioning policy for some years to come.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>therapies,</b> patient {{outcomes}} {{are not always}} positive. Some patients leave therapy prematurely (dropout), while others experience deterioration in their psychological well-being. METHODS: The sample for dropout comprised patients (n[*]=[*] 10 [*] 521) seen by 85 therapists, who attended at least the initial session of one-to-one therapy and completed a Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) at pre-treatment. The subsample for patient deterioration comprised patients (n[*]=[*] 6405) seen by the same 85 therapists but who attended two or more sessions, completed therapy and returned a CORE-OM at pre-treatment and post-treatment. Multilevel modelling was used to estimate the extent of therapist effects for both outcomes after controlling for patient characteristics. RESULTS: Therapist effects accounted for 12. 6 % of dropout variance and 10. 1 % of deterioration variance. Dropout rates for therapists ranged from 1. 2 % to 73. 2 %, while rates of deterioration ranged from 0 % to 15. 4 %. There was no significant correlation between therapist dropout rate and deterioration rate (Spearman's rho[*]=[*] 0. 07, p[*]=[*] 0. 52). CONCLUSIONS: The methods provide a reliable means for identifying therapists who return consistently poorer rates of patient dropout and deterioration compared with their peers. The variability between therapists and the identification of patient risk factors as significant predictors has implications for the delivery of safe psychological therapy services.

40|$|It is {{contended that}} {{research}} on <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>therapies</b> requires a measuring instrument {{sensitive to the}} specificity of the variables and the individuality of the clients under study. Repertory grid technique is considered to fulfil these requirements, and the study concerns itself largely with the validity and usefulness of this instrument in such research. Major hypotheses are that: grid measures are meaningfully related to independent measures; meaningful differences obtain between clients clinically assigned to group psychotherapy and those assigned to behaviour therapy; and between characteristics predictive of response to these two therapies; individualised predictions of therapeutic outcome are more successful than general predictions. The validity of various non-grid measures is also examined, as is the relative ease of change on all measures during therapy. The hypotheses are tested by the pre-treatment assessment of 64 neurotic out-patients, and the serial re-assessment of 20 of those receiving group psychotherapy and 20 receiving behaviour therapy. Support is provided for all the major hypotheses. Certain grid indices of maladjustment {{are found to be}} meaningfully interrelated and associated with independent measures, and expected relation- ships are observed between non-grid measures. Meaningful differences between group and behaviour therapy clients, and between characteristics predictive of response to the two therapies, are found in construing and on non-grid measures. These results support Caine's model of a relationship between adjustment strategies, treatment expectancies, symptoms, and therapeutic response, and also suggest the importance of content of construing in deter- mining the latter. More individualised than general grid predictions of therapeutic change are confirmed, {{and this is not a}} function of a general reduction in extremity of construing. Evidence is also provided that therapeutic change is multidimensional, with greater ease of change at the symptom level. Implications for treatment selection, outcome criteria, therapeutic strategies, and further research are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chronic fatigue {{syndrome}} (CFS) has been defined, but many more patients consult {{in primary care}} with chronic fatigue that {{does not meet the}} criteria for CFS. General practitioners (GPs) do not generally use the CFS diagnosis, and have some doubt about the validity of CFS as an illness. Aim: To describe the proportion of patients consulting their GP for fatigue that met the criteria for CFS, and to describe the social, psychological, and physical differences between patients with CFS and those with non-CFS chronic fatigue in primary care. Design of study: Baseline data from a trial of complex interventions for fatigue in primary care. Setting: Twenty-two general practices located in London and the South Thames region of the United Kingdom recruited patients to the study between 1999 and 2001. Method: One hundred and forty-one patients who presented to their GP with unexplained fatigue lasting six months or more as a main symptom were recruited, and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) case definition was applied to classify CFS. Results: Approximately two-thirds (69 %) of patients had chronic fatigue and not CFS. The duration of fatigue (32 months) and perceived control over fatigue were similar between groups; however, fatigue, functioning, associated symptoms, and psychological distress were more severe in the patients in the CFS group, who also consulted their GP significantly more frequently, were twice as likely to be depressed, and {{more than twice as likely}} to be unemployed. About half (CFS = 50 %; chronic fatigue = 55 %) in each group attributed their fatigue to mainly psychological causes. Conclusions: In primary care, CFS is a more severe illness than chronic fatigue, but non-CFS chronic fatigue is associated with significant fatigue and is reported at least twice as often. That half of patients, irrespective of CFS status, attribute their fatigue to psychological causes, more than is observed in secondary care, indicates an openness to <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>therapies</b> provided in that setting. More evidence on the natural history of chronic fatigue and CFS in primary care is required, as are trials of complex interventions. The results may help determine the usefulness of differentiating between chronic fatigue and CFS...|$|E
40|$|Kirstie N Anderson, Paul Goldsmith, Alison Gardiner Regional Sleep Service, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK Introduction: Computerized {{or online}} {{cognitive}} behavioral therapies (CBTs) {{are increasingly being}} developed to deliver insomnia therapy (CBT-i). They seek to address the difficulty of delivering an evidence-based technology to {{a large number of}} patients at low cost. Previous online applications have shown significant but variable improvements in sleep efficiency and a decrease in insomnia severity when compared with control groups. The best online methodology remains debated, and there are no such applications currently available within the UK National Health Service. Method: Evaluation of treatment outcomes in 75 participants with insomnia disorder using an open-access, novel, interactive online therapy. Rigorous screening was first undertaken to exclude those with probable sleep apnea, restless legs, circadian rhythm disorder, or significant anxiety or depression prior to commencing therapy. A modern interactive video-based website was used to encourage compliance by personalizing therapy based on response. Sleep efficiency, sleep latency, total sleep time, and sleep quality were all assessed prior to and after intervention. Results: Of those who accessed therapy, 62 % were excluded based on a likely diagnosis of another sleep disorder (788 / 1281). Participants who completed therapy all had severe insomnia disorder, with a group mean sleep efficiency of 55 %. After intervention there was a significant increase in sleep efficiency and sleep latency, with modest nonsignificant improvements in total sleep time. The majority of users reported improved sleep quality, and compliance with therapy was very good, with over 64 / 75 completing > 90 % of sleep diary entries. Conclusion: Online CBT-i can be designed to deliver personalized therapy with good reported outcomes and high compliance rates in those who start therapy. This initial evaluation also suggests that screening for other sleep disorders and mental health problems is necessary as many other sleep disorders are detected in those who self-refer with insomnia. This would inform the development of any larger-scale applications within <b>the</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>therapies</b> used in the health care system.

In recent years, two psychological approaches, {{cognitive behavioural therapy}} (CBT) and family interventions (FI), have emerged from among a range of psychological approaches as effective therapies with the strongest evidence base.
