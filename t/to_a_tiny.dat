5|$|Some {{species have}} large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the {{entirety}} of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East. Other species have tiny, restricted distributions; this is most common in island endemics. The whistling dove is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove is restricted to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove is restricted to Grenada in the Caribbean. Some continental species also have tiny distributions; for example, the black-banded fruit dove is restricted to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon is restricted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove is restricted to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E
25|$|One {{containing}} American species {{which are}} mainly black-footed, black-plumaged, and have yellow skin {{at the base}} of the bill as well as white display crests behind the eyes in breeding plumage. They occur in marine and freshwater habitats. The flightless cormorant of the Galápagos Islands also seems to belong here. Its wings have been reduced by evolution <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> size, it is extremely apomorphic due to its flightlessness, and its plumage is entirely nondescript. If considered a distinct genus, they would get the name Dilophalieus or (more probably) Nannopterum, the old genus of the flightless cormorant.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the center}} of each beamline, and taking up the {{majority}} of the total length, are spatial filters. These consist of long tubes with small telescopes at the end that focus the laser beam down <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> point in {{the center of}} the tube, where a mask cuts off any stray light outside the focal point. The filters ensure that the image of the beam when it reaches the target is extremely uniform, removing any light that was misfocused by imperfections in the optics upstream. Spatial filters were a major step forward in ICF work when they were introduced in the Cyclops laser, an earlier LLNL experiment.|$|E

Although the German population of the once predominantly German-speaking city of Sibiu had declined <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> minority, Iohannis won a surprise victory and was re-elected by landslides in 2004, 2008 and 2012. Iohannis is credited with turning his city into one of Romania's most popular tourist destinations, and the city was declared the European Capital of Culture in 2007. In February 2013, Iohannis {{became a member of the}} National Liberal Party, accepting an invitation from Liberal leader Crin Antonescu, and was immediately elected the party's First Vice President, becoming the party's President the following year.|$|E

500|$|At {{its height}} {{in the early}} 1960s around 8% of the {{approximately}} 250,000 former Waffen-SS members living in West Germany were members of HIAG.

2500|$|On 17 March 1984, Blainey {{addressed}} a major Rotary {{conference in the}} Victorian city of Warrnambool. He regretted that the Hawke Labor Government in [...] "a time of large unemployment" [...] was bringing many new migrants to the areas of high unemployment, thus fostering tension. He blamed the government, not the migrants themselves. Criticising what he viewed as disproportionately high levels of Asian immigration, then running at 40 per cent of the annual intake, he added: [...] "Rarely {{in the history of}} the modern world has a nation given such preference <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> ethnic minority of its population as the Australian Government has done in the past few years, making that minority the favoured majority in its immigration policy".|$|E

2500|$|Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are {{a diverse}} group of ray-finned fish. Named for their {{prominent}} barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> parasitic species commonly called the candiru, Vandellia cirrhosa. There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus Corydoras, are important in the aquarium hobby. [...] Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many Auchenipteridae) are crepuscular or diurnal (most Loricariidae or Callichthyidae for example).|$|E
2500|$|Starting in 1902, Quaker Oats oatmeal boxes {{came with}} a coupon redeemable for the legal deed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> lot in Milford. The lots, {{sometimes}} as small as [...] by 10 feet, were carved out of a [...] tract in a never-built subdivision called [...] "Liberty Park". A small number of children (or their parents), often residents living near Milford, collected the deeds and started paying the extremely small property taxes on the [...] "oatmeal lots". The developer of the prospective subdivision hoped the landowners would hire him to build homes on the lots, although several lots {{would need to be}} combined before building could start. Since the subdivision into small lots predated Milford's planning and zoning regulations, the deeds were entirely legal, although they created a large amount of paperwork for town tax collectors, who frequently couldn't find the property owners and received almost no tax revenue from the lots.In the mid-1970s, when the town wanted to develop the area, town officials {{put an end to the}} oatmeal lots in a [...] "general foreclosure" [...] that avoided the enormous expense of individual foreclosures by condemning nearly all of the property in one legal filing. One of the streets in the Liberty Park subdivision plans, Shelland Street, was later built in the late 1990s as an access road to the Milford Power Company. The site is currently home to the BIC Corporation's lighter factory at 565 Bic Drive.
