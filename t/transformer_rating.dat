50|$|The knee-point voltage of {{a current}} {{transformer}} is {{the magnitude of}} the secondary voltage above which the output current ceases to linearly follow the input current within declared accuracy. In testing, if a voltage is applied across the secondary terminals the magnetizing current will increase in proportion to the applied voltage, until the knee point is reached. The knee point is defined as the voltage at which a 10% increase in applied voltage increases the magnetizing current by 50%. For voltages greater than the knee point, the magnetizing current increases considerably even for small increments in voltage across the secondary terminals. The knee-point voltage is less applicable for metering current transformers as their accuracy is generally much higher, but constrained within a very small range of the current <b>transformer</b> <b>rating,</b> typically 1.2 to 1.5 times rated current. However, the concept of knee point voltage is very pertinent to protection current transformers, since they are necessarily exposed to fault currents of 20 to 30 times rated current.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical EngineeringElectric {{vehicles}} (EVs) {{have been}} introduced as the demand for green transportation has increased. EVs require charging. Studies have shown that uncontrolled EV charging in {{certain areas of the}} community reduces the life of the distribution components, such as the secondary distribution transformer. One approach to remedying this is to increase the rating of the secondary distribution transformer, but by doing so, the no-load losses also increase. Minimizing no-load losses while deciding an optimal rating for the transformer during controlled and uncontrolled EV charging for an average day is studied in this work. The study is extended to include an hourly EV charging load. Along with no-load losses, the cost of the no-load losses and the cost of the transformer are minimized while deciding the optimal <b>transformer</b> <b>rating.</b> Controlling EV charging is another approach to controlling distribution losses and the transformer loss of life. Customer participation in delaying charging until getting the desired price is the approach taken in the next part of this study. Customer anxiety is defined and used as a measure to control EV charging behavior. The impact of customer anxiety on EV charging behavior is analyzed. An algorithm to control EV charging using customer anxiety as a measure is suggested in this work. The use of renewable resources along with controlled and uncontrolled EV charging and its impacts on the distribution transformer is studied here. Controlled EV charging deteriorates transformer life much less than uncontrolled EV charging does. The optimal <b>transformer</b> <b>rating</b> increases for uncontrolled EV charging versus controlled EV charging. When residential controlled EV charging along with energy from rooftop solar panels is used, the transformer loss of life is considerably reduced.

The cables are designed to withstand up to 250  A which approximately corresponds to around 50 % of PV power penetration. Step down the voltage with the transformer contributes to slightly increasing the load flow through the feeders which may affect the lifetime of the cables and the transformer itself. Fig.  13 depicts the transformer loading level for diverse load and PV power conditions where under the worst-case load scenario, 60 % PV penetration turns the distribution transformer to overloading conditions (shaded area) during peak production hours. In contrast, the transformer loading always remains functioning under its the nominal loading value with 30 % PV integration. Therefore, considering the <b>transformer</b> <b>rating</b> as a limiting parameter, the highest hosting capacity of the network is defined around 40 % corresponding to 140 kVA.

The methodology of this paper requires only six input data: <b>transformer</b> <b>rating,</b> low voltage, high voltage, connection of low-voltage coil, connection of high-voltage coil, and frequency.

40|$|To {{determine}} {{maximum demand}} currently and {{most widely used}} method in Australia is to simply follow Australian Standard guidelines and sum together the loads and find a suitable <b>transformer</b> <b>rating.</b> This practice is considered to have many flaws specifically from a construction and financial {{point of view and}} it is this lack of diversity, which this paper will be focusing on. Because of not giving due consideration for diversity, many transformers are largely oversized and as such can easily put strain on low budget contracts issued by clients as larger transformers not only cost more for the unit itself but will also increase structural support costs to adequately support the increased size and weight that the unit will have. The difficulty in attempting to create a more optimized transformer design is attributed to having to understand the ship loader operations at key intervals since maximum demand is the maximum load at certain time intervals.

In particular, 12 oil-immersed distribution transformers are designed: 6 three-phase transformer banks and 6 three-phase transformers; these designs meet all the requirements of a given transformer standard. As a result, curves of minimum TOC versus <b>transformer</b> <b>rating</b> are obtained for three-phase transformer banks and three-phase transformers. Moreover, similar curves from seven transformer manufacturers are collected; the advantage of this collection is that these different manufacturers have different types of transformers: oil immersed or dry type, core or shell type, various voltage classes and power ratings, and so on, and consequently more general conclusions can be drawn regarding the comparison of three-phase transformer banks and three-phase transformers. From these investigations, it was found that from the view-point of minimum total mass and minimum TOC, three-phase transformer banks should be recommended in case of small-size transformers (rating lower than 45 kVA).

For the investigated transformer and giventime period the load can be increased without endanger transformer lifetime. The dynamicallyrated capacity exceeds the nominal capacity through the whole tested time period but DTR showsmost effective during winter when the ambient temperature is colder and therefore, has a coolingeffect on the transformer. DTR is used to calculate available transformer capacity but an increasedcapacity often comes with the expense of decreased lifetime and reliability. With the help of DTRthe current rate of transformer lifetime usage can be calculated and used as input to economicalanalysis where there is a trade of between reliability and profit from increased capacity.

The motivation is to analyze the impact of different control signal frequencies i. e. per 15, 30, 45 and 60 minute control, from both the utility and consumer perspective. The analysis parameters are percentage reduction in peak demand, energy violation, number of violations, sustained duration of violation from utility perspective, and total deviation duration and sustained deviation duration from the preferred thermostat settings from consumer's perspective. The comparison of results is based upon permissible limits of temperature drift for each frequency as mentioned in ASHRAE 55 standards for thermal comfort. Since dynamic programming approach is used, the impact of number of states to be saved per stage is also analyzed. In an attempt to imitate a real system and test the algorithm, a simple intuition based household load profile model is first developed.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{how to provide}} standardized, current based, differential protection for any three-phase power transformer, including phase-shifting transformers with variable phase angle shift and transformers of all construction types and internal on-load tap-changer configurations. The use of standard transformer differential protection for such applications is considered impossible in the protective relaying standards and practices currently applied. The {{first part of the}} thesis provides the background for different types of power transformers and the differential protection schemes currently applied. After that a complete mathematical proof for the new, universal transformer differential protection principle, based on theory of symmetrical components, is derived. It is demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} make numerical differential protection relays which can properly calculate differential currents for any power transformer, regardless of whether it is of fixed or variable phase angle shift construction and whether current magnitude variations are caused by on-load tapchanger(s). It is shown how to correctly calculate differential currents by simultaneously providing on-line compensation for current magnitude variations, on-line compensation for arbitrary phase angle shift variations and settable zero-sequence current reduction on any power transformer side. By using this method differential protection for arbitrary power transformers will be ideally balanced for all symmetrical and nonsymmetrical through-load conditions and external faults. The method is independent of individual transformer winding connection details (i. e. star, delta or zigzag), but dependent on having the correct information about actual on-load tap-changer(s) position if they are built-in within the protected power transformer. The implementation and practical use of this new universal principle is quite simple, as all necessary transformer data is commonly available on the protected power <b>transformer</b> <b>rating</b> plate. Practical application of the universal method for the differential protection of standard transformers, special transformers and phase shifting transformer is presented. Detailed testing of this new universal differential protection method is given and it is based on actual field recordings captured by numerical relays in existing phase-shifting transformer installations and on simulations from the Real Time Digital Simulator for a practical dual-core, symmetrical phaseshifting transformer. The implementation of the universal transformer differential method for analogue and numerical transformer differential relays is also described. Problems for the differential protection caused by transformer inrush currents are discussed. The mathematical relationship between differential protection and directional protection is derived. Then it is shown that through the addition of supplementary directional criteria security and speed of the operation of the transformer differential protection can be improved. Finally, the use of additional directional criteria to significantly improve the sensitivity of the differential protection for transformer winding turn-to-turn faults is suggested. Captured disturbance files from numerical differential relays in actual power transformer installations, during internal and external faults, have been used to demonstrate the performance of additional directional criteria...|$|E
