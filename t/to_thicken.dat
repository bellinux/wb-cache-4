5|$|The {{third most}} common use of lithium is in greases. Lithium {{hydroxide}} {{is a strong}} base and, when heated with a fat, produces a soap made of lithium stearate. Lithium soap has the ability <b>to</b> <b>thicken</b> oils, and {{it is used to}} manufacture all-purpose, high-temperature lubricating greases.|$|E
5|$|The Stage Synthesizer {{combines}} wavetables with analog oscillators and FM operators. Featuring {{filter and}} envelope controls, the Synth Section's timbre knob {{allows users to}} move through different sound groups. A number of programs are available to store sounds under three categories – Synth, Pad or Bass. The Synth also includes a 2-band EQ, a glide (portamento) function, and a unison function which is used <b>to</b> <b>thicken</b> the sound. The Synth Section is 16-note polyphonic.|$|E

5|$|Within the UK, {{the most}} common {{variation}} is to use lamb instead of mutton. Gloucester Squab pie did not require lamb and suggests any leftover meat could be used. Other ingredients can be included, for example Agatha Christie produced a variant which included hard-boiled eggs and another recipe took the concept of serving with clotted cream and adds cream <b>to</b> <b>thicken.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1938, the T-26 was {{upgraded}} {{to the model}} 1938 version, which had a new conical turret with better anti-bullet resistance but the same welded hull as the T-26 mod. 1933 produced in 1935–1936. This proved insufficient in the Battle of Lake Khasan in 1938, so the tank was upgraded once more in February 1939 to have an underturret box with sloped (23°) 20mm side armoured plates. The turret featured an increase to 20mm at 18 degrees sloping. This time it was designated T-26-1 (known as the T-26 mod. 1939 in modern sources). There were subsequent attempts <b>to</b> <b>thicken</b> the front plate, but T-26 production soon ended in favour of other designs, such as the T-34.|$|E
5|$|While most temnospondyls are aquatic {{in early}} stages of life, most metoposaurids {{appear to have been}} {{terrestrial}} in their juvenile stage. Like other Mesozoic temnospondyls, adult metoposaurids were adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle. Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land. The cross-sectional thickness of limb bones in adult metoposaurids shows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial locomotion. Juvenile individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress, and could probably move about on land. To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle, a temnospondyl's limb bones would have <b>to</b> <b>thicken</b> with positive allometry, meaning that they would grow at a greater rate {{than the rest of the}} body. This is not the case in metoposaurids, meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|An {{intervertebral}} disc has a gelatinous core {{surrounded by a}} fibrous ring. When in its normal, uninjured state, most of the disc is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run {{to the outside of}} the disc. Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc. Over time, the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces. This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine, causing the ligaments of the spine <b>to</b> <b>thicken</b> and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae. As a result, there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass. When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease, the makeup of a disc changes: blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and/or herniated disc material can push directly on a nerve root. Any of these changes may result in back pain.|$|E
5|$|The soft, thin flesh {{ranges from}} white to {{yellowish}} to golden-orange. It has an odour and taste described variously as indistinct, or unpleasant and earthy. The spore print is white to cream. The oval spores are 5.5–7 by 4–4.5micrometres (µm), with walls that tend <b>to</b> <b>thicken</b> in age. The spores are cyanophilous, {{meaning that they}} will readily stain dark blue in methyl blue solution. Staining with Melzer's reagent often produces a dextrinoid (reddish-brown) colour reaction. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 25–40 by 5–8µm, and can be two-, three-, or four-spored. Cystidia (large sterile cells on the hymenium) are absent. The cap cuticle {{is in the form}} of a trichoderm, where the outermost hyphae are roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These hyphae are 4–15µm in diameter, and contain intracellular pigments that impart an orange-brown to yellow-brown colouring to the cells. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} cocktails, various modes of {{preparation}} exist, varying {{according to the}} recipes and styles of particular bars or mixologists. Most common varieties have adjusted amounts of vodka or coffee liqueur, or mixed brands of coffee liqueur. Shaking the cream in order <b>to</b> <b>thicken</b> it prior to pouring it over the drink is also common.|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{suppurative}} {{otitis media}} (CSOM) causes recurrent or persistent discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforation in the tympanic membrane, {{and can lead}} <b>to</b> <b>thickening</b> {{of the middle ear}} mucosa, mucosal polyps, and cholesteatoma. 						CSOM is a common cause of hearing impairment, disability, and poor scholastic performance, and can occasionally lead to fatal intracranial infections and acute mastoiditis, especially in resource-poor countries...|$|R
30|$|A- 10 -year-old female with fronto-orbital FD {{complained of}} left visual acuity disturbance. Head {{computed}} tomography showed compressed optic canal secondary <b>to</b> <b>thickened</b> bone. Decompression of the optic canal via the left frontotemporal extradural approach, {{opening of the}} lateral orbital wall, and dissection of the prominent zygoma were done simultaneously. The patient’s visual acuity disturbance and exophthalmos subsequently improved postoperatively.|$|R
5000|$|Pulmonary {{fibrosis}} (literally [...] "scarring of the lungs") is a {{respiratory disease}} in which scars are {{formed in the}} lung tissues, leading to serious breathing problems. Scar formation, the accumulation of excess fibrous connective tissue (the process called fibrosis), leads <b>to</b> <b>thickening</b> of the walls, and causes reduced oxygen supply in the blood. As a consequence patients suffer from perpetual shortness of breath.|$|R
25|$|Bone glue {{can be made}} by {{prolonged}} boiling {{of ground}} or cracked bones, followed by filtering and evaporation <b>to</b> <b>thicken</b> the resulting fluid. Historically once important, bone glue and other animal glues today have only a few specialized uses, such as in antiques restoration. Essentially the same process, with further refinement, thickening and drying, is used to make gelatin.|$|E
25|$|Levels of {{arterial}} pressure put mechanical {{stress on the}} arterial walls. Higher pressures increase heart workload and progression of unhealthy tissue growth (atheroma) that develops {{within the walls of}} arteries. The higher the pressure, the more stress that is present and the more atheroma tend to progress and the heart muscle tends <b>to</b> <b>thicken,</b> enlarge and become weaker over time.|$|E

25|$|Kayu may be {{made with}} just rice and water, and is often {{seasoned}} with salt. Eggs can be beaten into it <b>to</b> <b>thicken</b> it into gruel. Toppings may be added to enhance flavour; Welsh onion, salmon, roe, ginger, and umeboshi (pickled ume fruit) {{are among the most}} common. Miso or chicken stock may be used to flavor the broth. Most Japanese electric rice cookers have a specific setting for cooking congee.|$|E
25|$|In Taiwan, congee is {{prepared}} {{in the same}} way as in Fujian Province, China, and consists of rice and water, with few other ingredients. Sweet potato is often added for taste, and eggs are sometimes beaten into it <b>to</b> <b>thicken</b> it to a gruel. As with most Chinese styles, congee is often served to the ill and those with difficulty chewing. A variety of side dishes are often served with congee, as well.|$|E
25|$|Richard {{frequently}} {{played the}} Wurlitzer electric piano, which he purchased during his Spectrum days. He also played the grand piano, Hammond organ, synthesizer and the harpsichord. In the studio, he dubbed the Wurlitzer over acoustic piano parts <b>to</b> <b>thicken</b> the sound. From the mid-1970s, he also used Fender Rhodes pianos, and kept {{up to date}} with music technology. While touring, he alternated between grand piano, Rhodes and Wurlitzer on stage, for different songs.|$|E
50|$|Because {{this growth}} usually {{ruptures}} the epidermis {{of the stem}} or roots, plants with secondary growth usually also develop a cork cambium. The cork cambium gives rise <b>to</b> <b>thickened</b> cork cells <b>to</b> protect {{the surface of the}} plant and reduce water loss. If this is kept up over many years, this process may produce a layer of cork. In the case of the cork oak it will yield harvestable cork.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to inventing {{the form of}} urushi-e, painting with lacquer, Zeshin also experimented greatly with the technical elements of using lacquer. He mixed his lacquers {{with a variety of}} substances to achieve different colors and textures, and to control the consistency and flexibility of the lacquer. He mixed certain substances with the lacquer to ensure it would not crack when his urushi-e scroll paintings were rolled up. He used bronze in his lacquer to simulate the appearance and texture of iron, and cereal starch <b>to</b> <b>thicken</b> his lacquer to simulate, at least in some respects, the effect of Western oil painting.|$|E
25|$|About {{the fifth}} month a ring-like {{constriction}} marks {{the position of}} the cervix of the uterus, and after the sixth month the walls of the uterus begin <b>to</b> <b>thicken.</b> For a time the vagina is represented by a solid rod of epithelial cells. A ring-like outgrowth of this epithelium occurs {{at the lower end of}} the uterus and marks the future vaginal fornix. At about the fifth or sixth month the lumen of the vagina is produced by the breaking down of the central cells of the epithelium. The hymen represents the remains of the Müllerian eminence.|$|E
