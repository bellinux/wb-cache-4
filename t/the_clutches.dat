50|$|Slipping <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as feathering <b>the</b> <b>clutch)</b> is a term used by automotive enthusiasts to describe when the driver alternately applies and releases <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> to achieve some movement of the car. It's called slipping because <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> plate will slip against the flywheel surface when such an action is performed. Slipping <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is known to be}} hard on <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> surface due to the sliding friction created.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> is {{typically}} disengaged by a thrust bearing that makes contact with pressure petals on <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> ring plate and pushes them inward to release <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pad friction. Normally the bearing remains retracted {{away from the}} petals and does not spin. However, the bearing can be [...] "burned out" [...] and damaged by using <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal as a foot rest, which causes the bearing to spin continuously from touching <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> plates.|$|R
50|$|In {{a manual}} transmission, the {{flywheel}} {{is attached to}} the engine's crankshaft and spins along with it. <b>The</b> <b>clutch</b> disk is in between the pressure plate and the flywheel, and is held against the flywheel under pressure from the pressure plate. When the engine is running and <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> is engaged (i.e., <b>clutch</b> pedal up), <b>the</b> flywheel spins <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> plate and hence the transmission. As <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal is depressed, the throw out bearing is activated, which causes the pressure plate to stop applying pressure to <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> disk. This makes <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> plate stop receiving power from the engine, so that the gear can be shifted without damaging the transmission. When <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal is released, the throw out bearing is deactivated, and <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> disk is again held against the flywheel, allowing it to start receiving power from the engine.|$|R

5|$|Du Bois {{opposed the}} U.S. {{intervention}} in World War II, {{particularly in the}} Pacific, because he believed that China and Japan were emerging from <b>the</b> <b>clutches</b> of white imperialists. He felt that the European Allies waging war against Japan was an opportunity for whites to reestablish their influence in Asia. He was deeply disappointed by the US government's plan for African Americans in the armed forces: Blacks were limited to 5.8% of the force, and {{there were to be}} no African-American combat units– virtually the same restrictions as in World War I.The military later changed its policy, and units such as the Tuskegee Airmen saw combat. With blacks threatening to shift their support to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Republican opponent in the 1940 election, Roosevelt appointed a few blacks to leadership posts in the military.|$|E
50|$|Operators of 18-wheelers, farm equipment, {{tractors}} and other heavy equipment learn to float the transmission {{in and out}} of gear, beginning with dis-engaging <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> by pressing <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal only part way, enough to pull the transmission out of gear, re-engaging <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> in neutral (between gears by letting <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal all <b>the</b> way back out) to let the engine revolutions decelerate enough for the idle sprockets to shift, and free gear shafts to slow their revolutions per minute (RPM), then dis-engage <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> again (by pressing <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal only part way to the floor) a second time, and float the higher gear into engaging the drive coupling and flywheel and engaging <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> plates. Professional operators of heavy equipment take extensive safety training before ever learning how to double-clutch. Once an operator is familiar with range, range selector, rpm, velocity, and torque of heavy equipment like an 18-wheeler, he can begin to anticipate when to shift gears. Operators become familiar with ranges of gears. They also learn not to leave their foot on <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> while driving, because these types of transmissions use <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> for some very different purposes. <b>The</b> depth <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> is depressed to the floor will determine what <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> will be doing as a synchronizing function.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{changes in}} yolk {{cholesterol}} of eggs from different positions in <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> cycle and <b>the</b> relationship of blood cholesterol levels for different days of <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> cycle to egg cholesterol levels were studied. The mean values for yolk cholesterol decreased as <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> length {{and intensity of}} egg production increased. There {{were no significant differences}} in yolk cholesterol values for the eggs laid on the first, median or last days of <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> <b>The</b> plasma cholesterol the day no egg was laid was similar to that for the plasma cholesterol obtained the day of the first egg of <b>the</b> <b>clutch.</b> <b>The</b> plasma cholesterol values were significantly increased on the day of the last egg of <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> when there was no ovulation...|$|R
5|$|The god of Death, Yama, employs Yama-dutas (messengers of Yama) or Yama-purushas, {{who bring}} souls of all beings to Yama for judgement. Generally, all living beings, {{including}} humans and animals, go to Yama's abode upon death {{where they are}} judged. However, very virtuous beings are taken directly to Svarga (heaven). People devoted to charity, especially donors of food, and eternal truth speakers are spared the justice of Yama's court. War-heroes who sacrifice their life and people dying in holy places like Kurukshetra are also described as avoiding Yama. Those who get moksha (salvation) also escape from <b>the</b> <b>clutches</b> of yamadutas. Those who are generous and ascetics are given preferential treatment when entering Naraka for judgement. The way is lighted for those who donated lamps, while those who underwent religious fasting are carried by peacocks and geese.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Indiana Jones {{narrowly}} escapes <b>the</b> <b>clutches</b> of Lao Che, a crime boss in Shanghai, China. With his 11-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and {{the nightclub}} singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai {{on an airplane}} that, unknown to them, is owned by Lao. While {{the three of them}} sleep on the plane, the pilots parachute out, and they leave the plane to crash over the Himalayas while dumping its fuel. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover this and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft, and then riding down the slopes into a raging river. They come to Mayapore, a village in northern India, where the poor villagers believe them to have been sent by Shiva to retrieve the sacred sivalinga stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone {{may be one of the}} five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory.|$|E
5|$|In Bhattikavya, Jatayu dies in {{the arms}} of Rama without {{revealing}} that Sita is in <b>the</b> <b>clutches</b> of Ravana. After his arms are chopped, the unnamed demon – identified with Kabandha – falls and starts his counsel. The funeral pyre scene is dropped here. The demon tells Rama that Ravana abducted Sita and has taken her to Lanka. He advises Rama to form an alliance with Sugriva, without which Ravana will not be overcome. He instructs Rama to negotiate a deal with Sugriva as per which Rama will kill Vali and end Sugriva's sorrows and in return, Sugriva would mobilize his forces to defeat Ravana. The demon praises Rama, who purified the demon by his sword. The demon urges Rama to believe him as he is telling the truth. At last, the demon transforms into a radiant divine being as {{he was telling the truth}} and plunges into the sky.|$|E
5000|$|When <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal {{is fully}} released, <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> is fully engaged {{and all of}} the engine's torque is transferred. In this coupled state, <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> does not slip, but rather acts as rigid {{coupling}} to transmit power to the gearbox.|$|R
50|$|In {{a vehicle}} with a manual transmission, riding <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> refers to <b>the</b> {{practice}} of needlessly keeping <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> partially disengaged. This results in <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> {{being unable to}} fully engage with the flywheel and so causes premature wear on the disc and flywheel.|$|R

5|$|Sundjata {{starts the}} {{campaign}} by fleeing {{the city of}} Niani and <b>the</b> <b>clutches</b> of Sumanguru. He wanders through the wilderness, acquiring supporters along the way and eventually ends up encamping in Kangaba, from where musters his forces to destroy the Sosso scouts' forward base. He then seeks to undermine the power of Sumanguru with his allies, Tabon and Wagadou by taking a sacred relic cart to his enemies Niger, Sangaran, Labe, forcing these villages to submit to his rule. He then cuts off Sumanguru's resources by plundering gold {{from the city of}} Djenne; following that, he then takes over the Niger River and destroys all of Sumanguru's military camps in the region, acquiring the allegiance of Sumanguru's former vassals Fakoli and Mema. Sundjata finally assaults the enemy base in Koumbi Saleh, killing Sumanguru once and for all and establishing his sovereignty over the Malian Empire.|$|E
5|$|Much of the post-race debate {{centred on}} the Red Bulls' clash {{at the front}} of the field on lap 40. Both Webber and Vettel blamed each other for the crash. Team {{principal}} Christian Horner implied Webber remained partially responsible for failing to give Vettel enough room on the run to the corner, and he was noticeably frustrated and angry at both of his drivers for wasting a potential 1–2 finish. Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko insisted the team did not favour Vettel through their strategy and also offered the perspective that Vettel had to attack for fear of backing off into <b>the</b> <b>clutches</b> of Hamilton behind. McLaren chief engineer Tim Goss said the crash had prevented Red Bull from securing a 1–2 finish, but understood why Webber switched to a different engine mode as he noted that one of Vettel's engines had failed earlier in the season. He felt that the battle between both McLaren and Red Bull drivers for both championships would continue unabated. Red Bull held a meeting at their factory in Milton Keynes four days after the race, and all people in attendance believed the situation had been dealt with. The incident between Webber and Vettel is widely seen by the media as a key moment in the rivalry between the two drivers, which had started when Vettel collided with Webber at the 2007 Japanese Grand Prix and both drivers were forced to retire.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMulti-clutch {{transmissions}} usually use a three-segment buffer {{characteristic curve}} to shift control, {{which has a}} good controlling effect when <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> runs in a good condition.

25|$|Clutch size is {{inversely}} related {{to the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>clutches</b> previously laid, meaning that the more eggs a female lays in years prior, the fewer eggs will be in the present clutch.

This is thought to be due to resource depletion over time in the female, potentially from high investment in earlier clutches.|$|E
50|$|A common {{example of}} riding <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is to keep}} slight continual {{pressure}} on <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal whilst driving, as when a driver habitually rests his/her foot on <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> pedal {{instead of on the}} floorboard or dead pedal. Although this slight pressure is not enough to allow <b>the</b> <b>clutch</b> disc itself to slip, it is enough to keep the release bearing against the release springs.
