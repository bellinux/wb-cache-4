5|$|Because DNA {{collects}} mutations over time, {{which are}} then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny. This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in evolutionary biology. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations. This {{can be used in}} studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology; For example, DNA evidence is being used to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{rights activists}} ransack a {{laboratory}} and unwittingly release a creature with a ferocious appetite. As they flee in an SUV, the creature follows and grotesquely mutilates them. The Fringe team consisting of FBI agents Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo), Philip Broyles (Lance Reddick), and civilian consultants Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter Bishop (John Noble) arrives, and Walter sees evidence of different creatures' {{marks on the}} bodies. Olivia realizes {{one of them is}} missing, and after interviewing a student at MIT to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the victims, she realizes they were animal rights activists. While conducting autopsies on the bodies, an animal control team at a different site is killed by the creature after investigating a call.|$|E
5|$|Silvestre de Sacy {{eventually}} gave up {{work on the}} stone, but he was to {{make another}} contribution. In 1811, prompted by discussions with a Chinese student about Chinese script, Silvestre de Sacy considered a suggestion made by Georg Zoëga in 1797 that the foreign names in Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions might be written phonetically; he also recalled that as early as 1761, Jean-Jacques Barthélemy had suggested that the characters enclosed in cartouches in hieroglyphic inscriptions were proper names. Thus, when Thomas Young, foreign secretary of the Royal Society of London, wrote {{to him about the}} stone in 1814, Silvestre de Sacy suggested in reply that in attempting to read the hieroglyphic text, Young might look for cartouches that ought to contain Greek names and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> phonetic characters in them.|$|E

25|$|Given {{the proper}} {{environment}} and care, a Komondor is a responsible, loving dog. They are devoted and calm without being sluggish. As in any breed, there {{is quite a}} range of personalities, so your needs should be outlined clearly to your breeder. An experienced breeder can <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> that personality which would be happier as an independent livestock dog, or that which wants more to please and would make a good obedience dog or family pet. Adolescence can be marked by changes in a Komondor's temperament, eating habits, trainability and general attitude.|$|E

It has been hard to isolate these issues solely {{to the fact that the}} child’s parents are alcoholics. Other behaviors need to be studied, like dysfunctional family relationships, childhood abuse and other childhood stressors and how they may contribute to things like depression, anxiety and bad relationships in ACOAs.|$|E

The two were left alone {{in a room with}} the envelopes, and although there was a possibility that they would peek, {{this was supposed to be}} controlled by examining the envelopes later.

25|$|Evidence {{of absence}} is {{evidence}} of any kind {{that can be used}} to infer or deduce the non-existence or non-presence of something. For instance, if a doctor does not find any malignant cells in a patient this null result (finding nothing) {{is evidence of}} absence of cancer, even though the doctor has not actually detected anything per se. Such inductive reasoning is important to empiricism and science, but has well established limitations. The challenge thus becomes to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> when a researcher has received a null result (found nothing) because the thing does not exist (evidence of absence—objectively negative result), and when one simply lacks proper means of detection (absence of evidence—false negative).|$|E

Meanwhile, on 22 December, police in Manly, New South Wales contacted DIMIA, without providing photographs or other information, to see if Rau had used her Australian passport to leave the country.|$|E
25|$|Cornelia calls Dr. Wells back to {{the house}} to examine Richard's body. Dale asks Wells to hide the {{blueprint}} she took from Richard, because the others might think that she killed him for it. Reginald Beresford, a lawyer waiting in his car after he drove Richard to the house, comes inside. Reginald recognizes Jack, and the exposure of her fiancé makes Dale admit that she gave Wells the blueprint with the hidden room. Wells claims that he does not have the blueprint; Cornelia reveals other evidence incriminating him, and Anderson asks to question him alone. Wells knocks Anderson unconscious during the interrogation and drags him into another room. Before Wells can go to the hidden room, a stranger claiming to have lost his memory after he was attacked and tied up in the garage appears at the terrace door.

As Jerry removes his own shoes and begins to grow confident, the phone rings for Laura. When Laura gets off the phone she tells Jerry: [...] "Never get engaged." [...] Jerry then realizes {{that he has no}} chance with Laura, but has already committed himself – and his one-bedroom apartment – to an entire weekend with her, including a five-hour sightseeing boat ride around Manhattan.|$|E
500|$|Police visited Hindley, {{then being}} held in Cookham Wood, Kent, {{a few days after}} she had {{received}} the letter, and although she refused to admit any involvement in the killings, she agreed to help by looking at photographs and maps to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> spots that she had visited with Brady. She showed particular interest in photographs of the area around Hollin Brown Knoll and Shiny Brook, but said {{that it was impossible to}} be sure of the locations without visiting the moor. The security considerations for such a visit were significant; there were threats made against her should she visit the moors, but Home Secretary Douglas Hurd agreed with Topping that it would be worth the risk. Writing in 1989, Topping said that he felt [...] "quite cynical" [...] about Hindley's motivation in helping the police. Although the letter from Winnie Johnson may have played a part, he believed that Hindley's real concern was that, knowing of Brady's [...] "precarious" [...] mental state, she was afraid that he might decide to co-operate with the police, and wanted to make certain that she, and not Brady, was the one to gain whatever benefit there may have been in terms of public approval.|$|E
