50|$|Research {{indicates}} that trichromacy allows animals to distinguish red fruit and young leaves from other vegetation {{that is not}} beneficial to their survival. Another theory is that detecting skin flushing and thereby mood may have influenced the development of primate <b>trichromate</b> vision. The color red also has other effects on primate and human behavior as discussed in the color psychology article.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} explanations for this effect. Red {{is used in}} stop signs and traffic lights which may associate the color with halting. Red is also perceived as a strong and active color which may influence both the person wearing it and others. An evolutionary psychology explanation is that red may signal health as opposed to anemic paleness, or indicate anger due to flushing instead of paleness due to fear. It {{has been argued that}} detecting flushing may have influenced the development of primate <b>trichromate</b> vision. Primate studies have found that some species evaluate rivals and possible mates depending on red color characteristics. Facial redness is associated with testosterone levels in humans, and male skin tends to be redder than female skin.|$|E

Chloride substitution of Ce(tipip) 3 Cl with AgX [X- = acetate (OAc-), tosylate (OTs-), triflate (OTf-) and N 3 -] afforded Ce(tipip) 3 X. Treatment of [Et 4 N] 2 CeCl 6 with 2 equivalents of K(tipip) followed by treatment with Ag 2 O resulted {{in the formation of}} the μ-oxo complex Ce 2 (tipip) 2 Cl 2 (μ-tipip) 2 (μ-O) (12) characterized by X-ray crystallography.
