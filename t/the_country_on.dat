Kampuchea attempted a conventional defense, but this tactic led {{to the loss of}} half of its army within two weeks.

On the following day, a pro-Vietnamese state, known as the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established, with Heng Samrin as head of state and Pen Sovan as General Secretary of the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party.
