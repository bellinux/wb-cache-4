50|$|Scholars in {{international}} relations can be broken up into two different practices, realists and pluralists, of what they believe <b>the</b> ontological <b>state</b> of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is.</b> Realists believe {{that the world is}} one of only states and interstate relations and the identity of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> defined before any international relations with other <b>states.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, pluralists believe that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> only actor {{in international}} relations and interactions between <b>states</b> and <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> competing against many other actors.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{theory of}} the {{ontology}} of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> a spiritual or [...] "mystical entity" [...] with its own being, distinct from the members of <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> <b>The</b> German Idealist philosopher Georg Hegel (1770-1831) was perhaps the greatest proponent of this theory.

Today, the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not been extended to <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>are</b> the Third and Seventh Amendments, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive bail, and the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted, that criminal juries be composed of 12 members and be unanimous in their verdicts.|$|E
