5000|$|Either {{surgical}} option requires prior {{treatment with}} the non-specific and irreversible alpha adrenoceptor blocker phenoxybenzamine or a short acting alpha antagonist (e.g. prazosin, <b>terazosin,</b> or doxazosin). Doing so permits the surgery to proceed while minimizing {{the likelihood of}} severe intraoperative hypertension (as might occur when the tumor is manipulated). Some authorities would recommend that a combined alpha/beta blocker such as labetalol also be given in order to slow the heart rate. Regardless, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker such as propranolol must never {{be used in the}} presence of a pheochromocytoma. The mechanism for β-adrenoceptor blocker-associated adverse events is generally ascribed to inhibition of β2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation, leaving α1-adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses to catecholamines unopposed and, thus, severe and potentially refractory hypertension. However some clinical guidelines permit beta-1 blockade use together with alpha blockers during surgery for control of tachycardia.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the initial, long-term, and durable response rates to <b>terazosin,</b> placebo, or other therapies {{in patients with}} chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome. METHODS: A total of 100 subjects, aged 20 to 50 years, who met the National Institutes of Health criteria for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and had not previously been treated with alpha-blockers, were entered in a 14 -week, double-blind comparison of <b>terazosin</b> or placebo therapy. Nonresponders and responders with subsequent relapse were treated with <b>terazosin</b> or other medications (open label). The criterion for response was a score of 0 to 2 on the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index quality-of-life item.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{assessed}} {{the effect of}} <b>terazosin</b> (Hytrin(R)) on functional bladder outlet obstruction in women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Functional bladder outlet obstruction {{was defined as a}} maximum flow rate of less than 12 ml per second combined with a detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate of more than 20 cm H 2 O in pressure flow studies in the absence of neurological disorders or mechanical causes. In a prospective pilot study 15 women with functional bladder outlet obstruction were treated with <b>terazosin.</b> <b>Terazosin</b> was initiated at 1 mg daily and gradually increased to the maintenance dose of 5 mg daily during 2 weeks. Symptoms and urodynamic parameters were assessed before and 3 to 4 weeks after the initiation of alpha-blocker therapy. RESULTS: While on <b>terazosin,</b> voiding symptoms subjectively improved greater than 50 % in 10 of the 15 women (p = 0. 002). Median maximum urethral closure pressure at rest decreased significantly from 98 to 70 cm H 2 O (p = 0. 001), median maximum detrusor pressure decreased from 45 to 35 cm H 2 O (p = 0. 008), median detrusor pressure at maximum flow decreased from 34 to 27 ml per second and median post-void residual urine decreased from 120 to 40 ml (p = 0. 006 and 0. 002, respectively). There was {{a significant increase in the}} median maximum flow rate from 9 to 20 ml per second and in median voided volume from 300 to 340 ml (p = 0. 0005 and 0. 021, respectively).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether pre-treatment of human skin with the α 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist <b>terazosin</b> would block vasoconstrictor responses and axon-reflex vasodilatation to the α 1 -adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine. Drugs were administered by iontophoresis into the skin of the forearm of 15 healthy participants, and skin blood flow was monitored with a laser Doppler flow probe at the site of methoxamine iontophoresis (to monitor direct vasoconstrictor responses) or 5 – 10 mm from the site of methoxamine iontophoresis (to monitor axon-reflex vasodilatation). Experimental sites were pre-treated with <b>terazosin</b> (administered by iontophoresis for 10 min at 200 µA), and the same current intensity was passed through 0. 9 % saline to control for the nonspecific effects of iontophoresis.

40|$|AIMS: A radioreceptor assay {{has been}} {{developed}} for alpha 1 -adrenoceptor subtypes and applied to a pharmacokinetic analysis of tamsulosin and <b>terazosin.</b> METHODS: Young, male, healthy volunteers received 0. 4 mg tamsulosin (as Omnic modified release capsules) or 5 mg <b>terazosin</b> (as Flotrin tablets) in a randomized, cross-over design. Before and after 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 23. 5 h plasma was analyzed by radioreceptor assay using cloned human alpha 1 A-, alpha 1 B- and alpha 1 D-adrenoceptors and specific h. p. l. c. analysis. RESULTS: Following ingestion of tamsulosin median peak plasma levels of 16 ng ml(- 1) were reached after 5 h and declined to 2 ng ml(- 1) at 23. 5 h. The time course in the radioreceptor assay was similar, and at most time points binding to alpha 1 A-adrenoceptors was significantly greater than to alpha 1 B- and alpha 1 D-adrenoceptors. Following ingestion of <b>terazosin</b> median peak plasma levels of 91 ng ml(- 1) were reached after 1 h and declined to 11 ng ml(- 1) at 23. 5 h. In the radioreceptor assay binding also peaked at 1 h and declined thereafter, but even after 23. 5 h considerable binding activity remained detectable at all three subtypes. At most time points binding to the alpha 1 A- and alpha 1 D-adrenoceptor was significantly greater than to the alpha 1 B-adrenoceptor. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist pharmacokinetics can be monitored by radioreceptor assays in a subtype-selective manner.

In another 15 participants, the nociceptive {{effect of the}} α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist clonidine was investigated with and without prior treatment with the α 2 -antagonist rauwolscine. Drugs were introduced into the skin by iontophoresis, and burns were induced by heating the skin to 48 °C for 2 min. Heat pain thresholds to a temperature ramp (0. 5 °C/s), and heat pain ratings to a thermal stimulus (45 °C, 7 s), were determined before and after the administration of each drug. Thermal hyperalgesia provoked by phenylephrine was inhibited by <b>terazosin</b> administered after the burn injury, but not by <b>terazosin</b> administered before the burn injury. However, neither α 2 -adrenoceptor stimulation nor blockade affected sensitivity to heat in the mildly burnt skin. These findings suggest that stimulation of cutaneous α 1 -adrenoceptors increased the excitability of heat-sensitized nociceptive afferents. As <b>terazosin</b> was more effective when administered in burnt skin, an inflammatory response induced by the burn injury may have facilitated access of adrenergic agents to α 1 -adrenoceptors...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION - OBJECTIVES Autonomic {{sympathetic}} innervation of prostatic smooth muscles {{is mediated}} by α-adrenergic receptors. <b>Terazosin</b> represents a widely-used α 1 -adrenergic antagonist which exerts {{its effect on}} prostatic stroma {{as well as on}} bladder neck. It causes smooth muscle relaxation and reduces the “dynamic” element of bladder outlet obstruction. Over the past decade it has been postulated that the above drug also induces apoptosis in prostatic cells potentially via its quinazoline-dependent activation of the transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta signal transduction pathway. In the present study we examined the effect of <b>terazosin</b> on the expression of caspases - 1 and - 3, which play a predominant role in the apoptotic cascade, in rat ventral epithelial cells. MATERIALS - METHODS Twenty-two 100 ± 5 day-old male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into two groups. One group (group A', 12 rats) received treatment with <b>terazosin</b> hydrochloride (Hytrin®, Abbott) (1. 2 mg/Kg body weight every alternate day) through a specially modified oesophageal catheter for 120 days. Control subjects (group B', 10 animals) received the same amount of normal saline. Within 24 hours {{after the end of the}} experiment either <b>terazosin</b> or normal saline were discontinued and, subsequently, rats were sacrificed. Ventral prostate glands were, thereafter, dissected and weighed. Each gland was fixed in 10 % buffered formalin and subsequently, fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin and assessed histologically as well as immunohistochemically using anti-caspase- 1 and - 3 polyclonal antibodies and a standard avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method in sections of the ventral prostate. RESULTS All rats remained healthy throughout the course of the treatment. No terazosin-related side effects were observed. All animals showed the expected continuous increase in their body weights (p 0. 1). Moreover, <b>terazosin</b> treatment did not result in any macroscopic or microscopic alterations in prostate morphology. Caspase- 1 and - 3 expression were weak in both groups, however, more intense in <b>terazosin</b> group compared to controls (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS <b>Terazosin</b> treatment enhances both caspase- 1 and caspase- 3 expression in rat ventral prostatic epithelial cells. It seems that these enzymes play a pivotal role in apoptotic process that is induced by quinazoline-based α 1 -adrenergic antagonists. ...|$|E

40|$|Medical {{management}} is rapidly becoming a very im-portant {{part of the}} armamentarium of the urologist in-volved {{in the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia. The commonest options for medical management include alpha-blockers, 5 -alpha reductase inhibitors, and pro-gestational anti-androgens. We present a double-blind randomized controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of <b>terazosin,</b> finasteride and allylestrenol, the prototype drugs in each of these respective categories. A total of 140 patients who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria were inducted into the trial after an informed consent. They were randomized into 4 groups, which received placebo, <b>terazosin,</b> finasteride and allylestrenol respectively for 6 months. Since 29 patients did not complete 6 months of therapy, there were 111 evaluable patients {{at the end of the}} study. We found that these 3 drugs produce comparable improvement in symp-tom score (- 40 %), flow rates (- 60 %) and PVR (- 50 %) which is significantly better than that in the placebo group. Both allylestrenol and finasteride bring about a comparable reduction in prostate volume (- 23 %), which is statistically significant as compared to the placebo and <b>terazosin</b> groups. <b>Terazosin</b> in doses of I and 2 mg/ day was, found to be effiective and well-tolerated in the vast majority of our cases. No adverse effects were seen in the placebo and finasteride groups, while 9. 6 % in the <b>terazosin</b> group had postural hypotension and 10. 7 % in the allylestrenol group had some loss of libido, prob-lems which were reversible upon cessation of therapy...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{determined}} the clinical efficacy {{and safety of}} <b>terazosin</b> {{in the treatment of}} patients with female lower urinary tract symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 females 20 to 70 years old who met the inclusion criteria of total International Prostate Symptom Score 8 or greater, symptom duration 1 or more months, and did not meet any exclusion criteria were entered into the study. Subjects were randomized to receive <b>terazosin</b> or placebo in titrated dose from 1 mg od, 1 mg twice daily to 2 mg twice daily during 14 weeks. Successful treatment outcomes use primary end point of International Prostate Symptom Score quality of life 2 or less and secondary end point of total International Prostate Symptom Score 7 or less. Other outcome measures included International Prostate Symptom Score individual item scores, King's Health Questionnaire quality of life domains, objective assessment parameters of 24 -hour frequency volume chart, maximum flow rate and post-void residual urine. RESULTS: Using a primary end point, 32 of 40 (80 %) evaluable <b>terazosin</b> subjects responded in contrast to 22 of 40 (55 %) evaluable placebo subjects (p 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: <b>Terazosin</b> proved to be more effective and safe than placebo in patients with female lower urinary tract symptoms...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: In {{patients}} with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic obstruction the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist <b>terazosin</b> lowers blood pressure whereas only very small if any alterations were reported with the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist tamsulosin. Therefore, we have compared the vascular alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonism of tamsulosin and <b>terazosin</b> directly. METHODS: Ten healthy subjects were investigated in a randomized, single-blind, three-way cross-over design {{and received a}} single dose of 0. 4 mg tamsulosin, 5 mg <b>terazosin</b> or placebo on 3 study days at least 1 week apart. Before and 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 23. 5 h after drug intake, alterations of diastolic blood pressure and other haemodynamic parameters {{in response to a}} graded infusion of the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine were determined non-invasively. RESULTS: At most time points tamsulosin inhibited phenylephrine-induced diastolic blood pressure elevations significantly less than <b>terazosin</b> (5 h time point: median difference in inhibition 35 %, 95 % CI: 18. 7 - 50. 3 %). On the other hand, phenylephrine-induced changes of cardiac output, heart rate and stroke volume were similar during both active treatments. CONCLUSIONS: In doses equi-effective for treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms tamsulosin causes less inhibition of vasoconstriction than terazosi...|$|E
40|$|A simple, {{sensitive}} and reproducible {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) method was developed for the determination of <b>terazosin</b> in human plasma. The method involves a one-step single solvent extraction procedure using dichloromethane with a 0. 25 ml plasma sample. Recovery values were all greater than 90 % over the concentration range 0. 25 - 100 ng/ml. <b>Terazosin</b> was found to adsorb to glass or plastic tubes, but this could be circumvented by using disposable plastic tubes. Also, rinsing the injector port with methanol after each injection helped to prevent any carry-over effect. The internal standard, prazosin, did not exhibit this problem. The method has a quantification limit of 0. 25 ng/ml. The within- and between-day coefficient of variation and accuracy values were all less than 7 % over the concentration range 0. 25 - 100 ng/ml and hence the method is suitable for use in pharmacokinetic studies of <b>terazosin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men. Treatment failure in {{prostate}} cancer is usually due {{to the development of}} androgen independence and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs at an advanced stage. Recently, it was reported that the alpha 1 -adrenoceptor antagonist <b>terazosin</b> was able to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth and indicated that it may have an implication in the treatment of prostate cancer. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the mechanisms involved in terazosin-induced prostate cancer cell death using two androgen-independent cell lines, PC- 3 and DU 145. Our results showed that <b>terazosin</b> inhibited not only prostate cancer cell growth but also colony forming ability, which is the main target of chemotherapy. We also found that the sensitivity of these cells to <b>terazosin</b> was not affected by the presence of either functional p 53 or Rb, suggesting that the terazosin-induced cell death was independent of p 53 and Rb. However, the terazosin-induced cell death was associated with G 1 phase cell cycle arrest and up-regulation of p 27 KIP 1. In addition, up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl- 2 was also observed indicating that these two apoptotic regulators may play important roles in terazosin-mediated cell death pathway. Our results provide evidence for the first time that <b>terazosin</b> may have a therapeutic potential in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We {{determined}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} a relatively high dose of <b>terazosin</b> (5 mg) in Korean patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), with or without concomitant hypertension. Materials and Methods: From July to December 2006, 200 men who consecutively presented with LUTS were prospectively studied. Eight weeks after treatment, blood pressure (BP), uroflowmetry, and International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) were assessed. For analysis purposes, patients were stratified according to concomitant hypertension. Of the 200 patients, 173 completed the scheduled eight-week treatment period. Results: At baseline, no differences were evident {{in the two groups}} in terms of I-PSS, Qmax, PVR and BP. After eight weeks of treatment-although I-PSS and uroflowmetry parameters were not significantly different in the two groups-systolic and diastolic BP in the non-hypertensive control group were higher than in the hypertensive group (p= 0. 001 and p = 0. 0100, respectively). Changes in I-PSS, uroflowmetry parameters, and BPs measured at week eight posttreatment commencement did not significantly differ between the two groups. Moreover, the addition of 5 mg of <b>terazosin</b> to antihypertensives did not cause a significant reduction in either systolic or diastolic BP in either group. Conclusion: Adding <b>terazosin</b> to existing antihypertensive regimens did not seem to increase the incidence of adverse events. Our findings suggest that 5 mg <b>terazosin</b> is effective and that it has an acceptable safety profile as an add-on therapy for patients with LUTS and concomitant hypertension.
