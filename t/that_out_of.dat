Historian Jacek Jędruch notes <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the 53 disrupted Sejms, 32 were disrupted by the liberum veto.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} shown <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> all dog breeds, it is the Labrador Retriever that {{is most likely to}} be obese. In a 2016 {{published}} study it was shown <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 310 Labradors, most were missing all or parts of the POMC gene. This gene plays a part in appetite regulation as well as indication of the amount of one's stored fat. The study concluded that the absence of that gene {{had a significant impact on}} Labrador weight and appetite. The POMC gene mutation is present in only one other breed – the Flat-coated Retriever.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the advance}} voting period, the total number of votes was 1,249,198, or 31.2% of the electorate, with more women voting. In the {{previous}} election, 29.2% voted in advance. Significantly, President Tarja Halonen voted during advance voting. However, there were some problems with expatriate voting as the embassy in Germany ran out of ballots on 9 April forcing an extension to 11 April. The expatriate vote was considerably higher than in the previous election, up from 8.6% in 2007 to 15%. The Foreign Ministry said <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a total of 228,000 expatriates eligible to vote 35,049 cast their ballots at the Finnish diplomatic missions, which was up from 27,399.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{existence}} of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% whites, 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians. The second official national census in 1890 revealed that in a population of 14,333,915, 44% were whites, 32.4% browns, 14.6% blacks and 9% Indians.|$|E
5|$|Following {{an initial}} {{decline in the}} {{population}} of Navenby {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, the post-war years saw numbers rise steeply. This increase can be directly linked to the 35-plus new houses built from the end of The Great War until the 1950s, as well as to other building projects from the 1970s onwards. Other post-war changes include the move away from a dependence on farming. Although Navenby continues to be surrounded by farms, it is now largely a dormitory village for Lincoln, Grantham and beyond. Figures from the 2001 census show <b>that,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a population of 1,666, almost 600 commute to work each day.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, it {{was found}} that {{families}} failed to seek medical treatment for their daughters because of the stigma associated with negative medical histories.

The next day, Lydia allays her fears to Sarah over {{relationships}} and the girls seal it with a kiss, which Michaela sees. Sarah and Lydia then begin a full relationship. It is revealed <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her family, Persephone {{is the only one who}} knows of Lydia's sexuality. Lydia replaces Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) as the drummer of Josh's band 'The Somethings' as he kicked him out because he was against having wheelchair user Hayley Ramsey (Kelly Marie Stewart) as the lead singer because of their bad breakup. Lydia is later kicked out of the band due to unreliability.|$|E

In 2010, he guest starred in two episodes of the HBO drama series Treme, as Lt. Terry Colson of the New Orleans Police Department. He was promoted to series regular starting with the show's second season, which began in April 2011.

5|$|The exact {{degree of}} Caroline's wealth was always {{problematic}} to trace, as {{the king had}} placed {{so much of it}} in different sources often difficult to locate and measure both during his lifetime and after his death.

5|$|We love, obviously, to do provocative imagery... {{we always}} try to {{definitely}} push the limits... I think because, in the end, it's not really at all about domestic violence. It's really just about it being toxic, and they're on this drug trip and that definitely plays a part, but I think it's also about being triumphant over those weaknesses, and she leaves him. It's not trying to glorify that type of relationship. The bad parts of it, that's what you don't want. In the end, her leaving, it represents her getting <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her life. The drugs and the addiction and the toxic—that's what brings her downfall and brings a lot of harm.|$|E
5|$|Within two months, {{however, the}} limit of the {{operational}} area was extended past the Mekong, and U.S. tactical aircraft were soon directly supporting Cambodian forces in the field.

5|$|During {{the second}} phase, {{starting}} in June 2012, {{half of the}} funds from energy and food subsidies will be re-allocated {{to the people and}} the remaining 50% will go to the industrial sector. If approved by the Parliament, the government will pay an extra cash handout of 280,000 rials/month to 80% of the general population (i.e. people earning less than $2000/month, which is a comfortable income level in Iran). In July 2012, it was announced that implementation of the second phase was suspended awaiting further adjustments by the government and because of raising inflation (around 22% as of April 2012). Finally, in fall 2013, the parliament approved a plan to drop 22 million Iranians—the top 30 percent of earners—from the subsidy system instead. Yet, it was reported in 2014 <b>that</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Iran’s population of 77 million, 73.6 million registered to receive the cash hand-outs.|$|E
5|$|In a rare move, District Judge Earnest Lau {{released}} a 14-page judgment explaining the court's denial of Odex's request for Pacific Internet's client information. He compared Odex's demands to an Anton Piller order, which {{provides for the}} right to search premises and seize evidence without prior warning. Seen as draconian, it is only used under extreme circumstances. He held that only copyright holders themselves, or their exclusive licensees, can bring such applications and that he was not satisfied with the evidence harvested by BayTSP for the identification of downloaders. Out of all the anime licensed to Odex, only the license in respect of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED had been granted exclusively to the company. The judge noted <b>that,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the 13 authorisation letters presented in court, ten of them authorised the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore (AVPAS), not Odex, to act for the copyright holders. Odex was ordered to pay Pacific Internet's legal costs of S$7,000.|$|E
