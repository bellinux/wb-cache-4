5|$|Lambert {{proved to}} be unable to mix the track, and a fresh attempt at {{recording}} was made {{at the start of}} April at Mick Jagger's house, Stargroves, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Glyn Johns was invited to help with production, and he decided <b>to</b> <b>re-use</b> the synthesized organ track from Townshend's original demo, as the re-recording of the part in New York was felt to be inferior to the original. Keith Moon had to carefully synchronise his drum playing with the synthesizer, while Townshend and Entwistle played electric guitar and bass.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the fall of Gush Etzion, news of Degania's {{successful}} stand (as well as that of Kfar Darom) provided a morale boost for other Israeli villages. The battle also influenced British opinion on {{the balance of power in}} the war. The success of the Napoleonchik field cannons prompted the Israeli high command <b>to</b> <b>re-use</b> two of them in attempts to capture Latrun. The flight from Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan, on the other hand, stirred controversy in the young state, fueled by news of the Kfar Etzion massacre just days before, and the Palmach issued a newsletter accusing them of abandoning national assets, among other things. These accusations were subsequently repeated in media and in a play by Yigal Mossensohn, and a campaign was started by the villagers to clear their name.|$|E

5|$|Sullivan tended <b>to</b> <b>re-use</b> his ballet music. Of {{the five}} {{movements}} that Tillett and Spencer identified, only one (the Waltz, No. 3) {{is not known}} to have been used in any other work. Three of the movements had previously been used in L'Île Enchantée. Two of those, and one other, were eventually re-used in Victoria and Merrie England. One was also used in his incidental music to Macbeth. Sullivan was asked in 1889 to supply a ballet for a French-language production of The Mikado in Brussels, which he duly did. Tillett suggests that the Thespis ballet was almost certainly the music that Sullivan provided, given that it was the only ballet that he wrote for use in an opera, and that three weeks after producing The Gondoliers he is unlikely to have written something original.|$|E
5|$|Both the Zygalski-sheet {{method and}} each bomba worked {{for only a}} single {{scrambler}} rotor order, so six sets of Zygalski sheets and six bomby were produced. However, the Germans introduced two new rotors on 15 December 1938, giving a choice of three out of five to assemble in the machines on a given day. This {{increased the number of}} possible rotor orders from 6 to 60. The Biuro could then only read the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have the resources to produce 54 more bomby or 54 sets of Zygalski sheets. Fortunately, however, the fact that the SD network was still using the old method of the same indicator setting for all messages, allowed Rejewski <b>to</b> <b>re-use</b> his previous method of working out the wiring within these rotors. This information was essential for the production of a full set Zygalski sheets which allowed resumption of large-scale decryption in January 1940. On 1 January 1939, the Germans made military Enigma even more difficult to break by increasing the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight, to between seven and ten.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{promoters}} for a canal was Richard Prat, who was {{a lawyer}} in Glastonbury, had been the town clerk since 1813, and held several important offices in the town. He saw the canal {{as a way to}} halt the economic downturn in the town and its drainage problems, and called a meeting in August 1825, at which a firm plan was formulated. Richard Hammett, a local man from Street, was commissioned to conduct a survey of the route in 1826. Hammett had experience of building a manure canal through peat heathland. He considered two main routes; the first followed the course of the River Brue, but was rejected on the grounds of engineering costs, and the interference with its drainage function. The second route followed the South Drain, which had been newly constructed following floods in 1794, to connect with the River Brue near Cripps Bridge, and <b>to</b> <b>re-use</b> the old course of that River at Highbridge to create a basin.|$|E

40|$|The {{object-oriented}} paradigm {{has several}} features that facilitate {{the integration of}} heterogeneous data management systems. One of the main problems in the integration is to provide users with the same data model and language to access very different systems. This problem exists {{in all kinds of}} distributed heterogeneous data management systems, independently from their integration architecture (like classical distributed databases, federated databases, multidatabases). This paper shows that the use of an object-oriented data model for building a "uniform" view of several databases can greatly simplify this task, and actually extends the scope of integration towards two directions. The first concerns the integration of data management systems to which traditional integration techniques, based on mappings among data models, cannot be applied. The second direction moves the goal of integration <b>to</b> <b>re-using</b> not only data but <b>to</b> <b>re-using</b> data and application software using these data. In the paper we also briefly discuss some requirements for an object-oriented integrated platform...|$|R

It was primarily intended for goods transfer between these railways, but the LB introduced a passenger service between Liverpool Street Station and Croydon.|$|E

25|$|The Penny Black lasted {{less than}} a year. A red {{cancellation}} {{was hard to see}} on the black design and the red ink was easy to remove; both made it possible <b>to</b> <b>re-use</b> cancelled stamps. In February 1841, the Treasury switched to the Penny Red and began using black ink for cancellations instead, which was more effective and harder to remove. However, people still reused stamps by combining the uncancelled parts of two stamps to form an unused whole, so in 1864 as a further safeguard the top corner stars on the Penny Red were replaced by the lower corner check letters in reverse order.|$|E

This continued into the 17th century, when André da Silva Machado, a wealthy merchant from Porto decided to build {{a replica of the}} Sanctuary of Bom Jesus de Braga. In 1680, he obtained authorization to dismantle the old fortress <b>to</b> <b>re-use</b> the stones to build a sanctuary to the invocation of Our Lady of the Pillar.

25|$|The Bajac {{agricultural}} tractor however proved not mobile enough — the initial experiment had only tested the wire-cutting ability — {{and had the}} severe disadvantage of having to approach the enemy lines driving backwards. Breton and Prétot then considered {{using some of the}} two hundred American four-wheel drive Jeffery tractors that had been commanded by the French Artillery. When this was refused, Commandant Boissin directed Breton to the Schneider company which was working on the caterpillar track system, under a production licence from the American Holt Manufacturing Company. Experiments with the Holt caterpillar tracks had started in May 1915 at the Schneider plant with a 75hp wheel-directed model and the 45hp integral caterpillar Baby Holt, showing the superiority of the latter. On 16 June, new experiments had followed in front of the President of the Republic, and again on 22 July 1915 in front of War Minister Alexandre Millerand, who decided on 7 August 1915 on the construction of 10 armoured and armed Breton-Prétot machines. For his machine, Breton was thus allowed to order ten Holt tractors, to use as a base for his wire-cutting machine,. Experiments again took place on 10 September for Commander Ferrus. This order was modified on 7 December 1915 into an order <b>to</b> <b>re-use</b> the caterpillars to produce the first Schneider CA1 tanks.|$|E
