25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I think my films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
500|$|... "The Food Wife" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer of The Simpsons Matt Selman. The writing process began around September 2010. According to Selman, the episode mainly revolves around Homer and Marge competing about who is perceived as the most fun by Bart and Lisa, a situation that he thinks parents can identify with in real-life. The episode also focuses heavily on foodies and food blogs. Selman {{said in an interview}} with New York magazine's Grub Street publication that the foodie culture is [...] "just a world <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> thought was funny and fascinating. The idea of food as not only something you enjoy eating, but as something that you are so passionate about that you're kind of bragging about it. 'I'm the one who discovered this particular Korean pork-neck soup restaurant,' and you can kind of claim that as yours. The blogging just feeds into that kind of territorial element <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> thought was inherently funny. And when I write Simpsons episodes, I try to start with a world I think is funny, and think, 'What's a good story we can tell in that world, using the characters that we have?'" ...|$|E

[...] Dutch public TV channel Nederland 2's daily news programme Netwerk reported that numerous American supporters of Israel financially supported Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) and openly approved of his message towards Islam and Islamic terrorism. Wilders told an audience during the report that [...] "We [...] are all Israel". He has also said [...] "Israel is the West's first line of defence" [...] against what he perceives {{to be a threat}} posed by Islam.|$|E

"Behind the Crooked Cross" [...] {{is rarely}} played live as Hanneman hates the track, though King has {{always wanted to}} play it [...] "because it's got a cool intro" [...] despite it not being his {{favorite}} song.

[...] "Ghosts of War" [...] isn't King's favorite song either, which he attests [...] "everybody always wants to hear" [...] performed live.

500|$|Smith {{starred in}} {{and served as}} {{executive}} producer for the independent romantic comedy Waiting for Ophelia, which was released in 2009. She funded the film, which was written by Adam Carl and based on a stage play he wrote in 2003. She said: [...] "I loved it. I never get to play parts like <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> play the friend of a friend, never the lead. And the script surprised me." [...] Carl stated it was very unlikely she would recoup her money, but Smith decided she [...] "believe in this project, and my expectations have already been fulfilled by making the movie", and added: [...] "You can support art even if it's {{not going to make}} a zillion dollars." [...] It premiered on April 4, 2009 at the Phoenix Film Festival.|$|E

"When I {{was writing}} it, I {{was sitting in}} a fourth-floor walk-up on Avenue-B, and there was this {{gorgeous}} Puerto Rican boy sitting across me that I wanted {{to go out on a}} date with, and I just wanted to get the song over with. I ultimately did go out with him and the song was finished just before my last date with him, which I'm kinda happy that it did not continue... The dance floor was quite a magical place for me. I started off wanting to be a dancer, so that had a lot to do with the song. The freedom <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> feel when I'm dancing, that feeling of inhabiting your body, letting yourself go, expressing yourself through music. I always thought of it as a magical place– even if you're not taking ecstasy. Hence that came to me as the primary inspiration for 'Into the Groove'." ...|$|E

500|$|On July 8, 2007, {{during the}} concert in St. Louis, {{two people in}} the crowd who {{attended}} the show suffered burns after pyrotechnics meant for the stage tumbled into the audience; Knowles visited them in the hospital after the show. During the performance of [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] at the Orlando, Florida show on July 24, Knowles fell down a flight of stairs. Her heel got caught in the bottom on her long coat and she tripped down; she quickly picked herself up and carried on with the show. After the incident Knowles jokingly asked the audience, not to post the footage on YouTube although she knew they would; several clips were posted on the video-sharing website and went viral. On July 26 YouTube removed many of the clips as they were infringing copyright terms. After an initial removal spree, clips of the incident reappeared on YouTube, and were uploaded to other content-sharing websites such as Dailymotion and eBaum's World. A spokesperson for the singer said she was not injured during the fall, which she described as a [...] "mere spot on an otherwise sensational, flawless show" [...] adding, [...] "Miss Knowles picked herself right up, without missing a beat, showing to all that she is the best." [...] When asked about the fall on CNN, Knowles said that she hit her head and chin and was bruised up. She further noted that she immediately started thinking to get up and continue performing the show harder as an athlete due to the adrenaline she had: [...] "Whenever I do something like <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> perform really, really hard cause it makes me little mad at myself so I just go crazy. So they got a really good show in the end." [...] During her performance in Toronto on August 25, while performing [...] "Déjà Vu", Knowles had a wardrobe malfunction as her dress flew over her head and was speculated to reveal her breast. However, a spokesperson for the singer revealed that the speculations weren't true, [...] "She's wearing a flesh-tone bra! Do you really think Beyoncé would go onstage like that?". The video which was uploaded to YouTube went viral. Powers of Los Angeles Times discussed about the incidents, saying: [...] "As a pop queen, Beyoncé is almost too perfect. A tumble down the stairs onstage in Orlando and a subsequent 'wardrobe malfunction' in Toronto garnered far more attention than was warranted partly because these mistakes contradicted her fiercely athletic style." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another term {{which appears}} in commentaries on Resnais {{throughout}} his career is [...] "surrealism", from his documentary portrait of a library in Toute la mémoire du monde, through the dreamlike innovations of Marienbad, to the latterday playfulness of Les Herbes folles. Resnais himself traced a link to his teenage discovery of surrealism {{in the works of}} André Breton: [...] "I hope <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> remain faithful to André Breton who refused to suppose that imaginary life was not a part of real life".|$|E

2500|$|Maddux was {{renowned for}} {{focusing}} on the outside corner. This approach was emphasized under former Atlanta Braves pitching coach Leo Mazzone. He would begin by throwing strikes with his fastball down and away, then expand the strike zone with his changeup—sometimes obtaining borderline strike calls from umpires simply {{on the strength of}} his reputation. In complement with this strategy, Maddux popularized a tactic of throwing his two-seam fastball off the plate inside to left-handed hitters, only to have the ball break back over the inside corner for a strike. Maddux said of that pitch, [...] "That was just my normal fastball that did <b>that.</b> ... <b>I</b> <b>always</b> had it. The pitch really started to work for me when I ... learned how to throw a cutter, it made that pitch more effective." ...|$|E
2500|$|Being more {{in control}} of her {{performances}} also appeals to Reddy, who said, [...] "I have more leeway in the songs that I choose to sing.

I'm doing the songs <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> loved. So many are album cuts that never got any airplay, and they're gorgeous songs." [...] She also does perform many of her best-known songs, including, [...] "Angie Baby," [...] "You and Me Against the World", a medley of [...] "Delta Dawn"/"Ain't No Way to Treat a Lady," [...] and [...] "I Am Woman," [...] reasoning on the latter that it's her signature song and one that the audience [...] "comes to hear." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2004, Tubridy Tonight began. This {{was his own}} live Saturday night talk show, seen as a {{successor}} to Kenny Live (formerly Saturday Night Live).

It was announced on 11 May 2009 that Tubridy would indeed succeed Pat Kenny as host of The Late Late Show. He vowed to bring back Gay Byrne's [...] "one for everybody in the audience" [...] catchphrase, described by Will Hanafin in the Irish Independent as an attempt to [...] "dig up more old relics than archaeologists would on an excavation", in reference to Tubridy's passion for history. Tubridy said he was [...] "very taken aback" [...] to learn he had been selected, describing it as [...] "a humbling honour to be asked to present such an iconic programme". His role as host allowed him to fulfill a childhood ambition – presenting The Late Late Toy Show — [...] "I know this is the one <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> wanted.

2500|$|Kelly's music {{took root}} in R, hip hop and soul. One of Kelly's {{earliest}} musical memories {{is listening to}} his mother, Joanne Kelly sing. As a young child, he {{was influenced by the}} work of musicians such as Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Al Green, Donny Hathaway, Sam Cooke, and The Isley Brothers. Although Stevie Wonder had a substantial influence on Kelly, Marvin Gaye, and Donny Hathaway are Kelly's greatest inspirations. In reference to Hathaway, Kelly declared: [...] "A guy like Donny Hathaway had a focused, sexual texture in his voice <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>always</b> wanted in mine," [...] Kelly said. [...] "He had smooth, soulful tones, but he was spiritual at the same time." [...] Kelly was heavily influenced by Marvin Gaye's R Lothario image. [...] "I had to make a baby-makin' album. If Marvin Gaye did it, I wanted to do it," [...] Kelly said. Public Announcement worked with Kelly during his debut at the tail-end of the new jack swing era, as they managed to further sustain its sound. While Kelly has created a smooth, professional mixture of hip-hop beats, soulman crooning, and funk, the most distinctive element of his music is its explicit carnality. [...] "Sex Me", [...] "Bump n' Grind", [...] "Your Body's Callin'", and [...] "Feelin' on Yo Booty" [...] are considered examples, as their productions were seductive enough to sell such blatant come-ons. Kelly's crossover appeal was also sustained by his development of a flair for pop balladry.|$|E
