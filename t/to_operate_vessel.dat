50|$|Cap Finisterre {{was renamed}} Taiyō Maru in 1920, and managed by Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK). However, NYK was {{initially}} {{at a loss}} {{as to what to}} do with such a large and expensive <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>vessel.</b> Japanese Prime Minister Takahashi Korekiyo finally called upon Asano Sōichirō, founder of Tōyō Kisen (Oriental Steamship Company) to accept the ship, and to place it on the company’s trans-Pacific route between Hong Kong, Shanghai, Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Asano addressed issues about the possible stability of vessel by lowering her funnels and adding more ballast to give her a lower profile in the water. He also sponsored a cruise from Yokohama to Hong Kong, on which he invited numerous luminaries from the business and political world (including Yasuda Zenjirō) to publicise vessel and its luxurious fittings. On arrival in San Francisco after its maiden crossing on 25 June 1921, it was lauded by the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper for bringing the largest number of passengers ever to come on a single ship.|$|E
30|$|International {{conventions}} {{were noted}} {{by government officials}} as being the basis for how they approached safety: “ships are regulated by port authorities based on the rules of international conventions. For example, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) stipulates that the ships must follow traffic separation schemes to arrive and depart from the port”. Similarly, port operators highlighted the importance of following Standard Operating Procedures (SOP): “people in the port will follow SOP <b>to</b> <b>operate.</b> <b>Vessel</b> Traffic Control Section (VTCS) has its own SOP. For example, the pilot procedure (for entering the port) can not exceed 30 minutes. The time of ship leaving port can not exceed 20 minutes”. Further, that ship calling and existing times were all recorded and checked, which “is done to check the responsibility… if there is someone who cannot finish their job on time, it will affect the ship calling time and ship safety”. Otherwise, one government official noted that the International Ship and Port Facility (ISPS) had six categories and different grades of security risk: “if there is any risky situation, the port authority could prevent the ship’s calling and the ship would {{have the right to}} refuse to call at the port….when the ship has risky situation, it may raise the security grade (e.g. to grade two or grade one). There is a standard rule to regulate it”. Such risks could involve diseases, for example, “if the ship has visited an epidemic area before… and it is still during the incubation period when the ship comes… then the port authority will be very serious about checking this ship”. Regarding cargo, some regulations applied, for example “LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) ships must be regulated and be isolated by 500 meters in case of potential collision risk….also, when a chemical ship arrives to the port, the bow of the ship must face the outside of the port through the Turning Basin”.|$|E

50|$|Manchester Liners was {{established}} on 3 May 1898, {{to provide a}} fortnightly transatlantic service between the Port of Manchester and North America, via the Manchester Ship Canal.

The success of its inaugural trip to Halifax, Nova Scotia, encouraged Manchester Liners to order seven more ships to the same design. The company continued <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> <b>vessels</b> registered in Manchester for more than 80 years, until 1985.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the major}} {{arguments}} in favor of integrated tug barge systems is the small number of crew required <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> such <b>vessel</b> — whereas a conventional vessel with capacity in par with the Finnpusku pusher-barge combination would require a crew of 16–17, the integrated tug-barge unit can be operated by a crew of only 9. In some cases an integrated system is adopted only for this reason and the pusher is rarely, if ever, decoupled from the barge.|$|R
