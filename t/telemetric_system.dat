50|$|Although {{there remains}} no gold {{standard}} for the diagnosis of GERD, ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring can provide data to guide further evaluation and treatment of patients with GERD-associated symptoms. In the past, an indwelling nasoesophageal catheter {{was the only way}} to measure esophageal acid exposure. Because this method is associated with nasal and pharyngeal discomfort and rhinorrhea, patients may have limited their activity and become more sedentary during the monitored period. This may have resulted in less acid reflux and a false negative test. A catheter-free radio <b>telemetric</b> <b>system</b> allows a longer period of monitoring and may be better tolerated.|$|E

40|$|Telemetrics: Drawing Translations {{began with}} {{charcoal}} drawings on paper, {{which were then}} converted into digital information, and finally re-rendered by three-dimensional software. This series of translations allow for a close exploration of the drawing 2 ̆ 7 s topography {{that is similar to}} the viewpoint of an exploratory rover. The imagery from this digital landscape was collected, exported, and translated into the mediums of print, painting, and video. This body of work was developed in reference to the <b>telemetric</b> <b>systems</b> that are currently in use to explore the cosmos. Space telescopes convert a physical stimulus (light) into electrical signals, or raw data. In order to be analyzed and understood, that information must be converted into a file that can be read over multiple representational platforms, both numerically and visually. Interpreting these data requires translation, which occurs at several levels as the astronomers prepare the data for interpretation. The resultant images, especially those presented to the public, have gone through several stages of adjustment for both informative and aesthetic reasons. In Telemetrics: Drawing Translations, the drawings function as the phenomena of the universe, all of that which can only be understood through telemetric analysis. The drawing 2 ̆ 7 s primacy in this system is established through its physicality, level of resolve, and the amount of interpretable information it contains. The derivatives of the drawings mirror the entropic nature of translating information across formats. Tone, contrast and an emphasis on the physical manipulation of material in the drawings formally reference the Rocky Mountain School paintings of the American West. The paintings of Thomas Moran, Albert Biertstadt, Thomas Hill and others allowed viewers to experience the sublime through an environment that was distant and imagined.

40|$|Swimming {{has become}} an {{important}} area of sport science research since the 1970 s, with the bioenergetic factors assuming a fundamental performance-influencing role. The {{purpose of this study}} was to conduct a critical evaluation of the literature concerning oxygen-uptake (VO 2) assessment in swimming, by describing the equipment and methods used and emphasizing the recent works conducted in ecological conditions. Particularly in swimming, due to the inherent technical constraints imposed by swimming in a water environment, assessment of VO 2 max was not accomplished until the 1960 s. Later, the development of automated portable measurement devices allowed VO 2 max to be assessed more easily, even in ecological swimming conditions, but few studies have been conducted in swimming-pool conditions with portable breath-by-breath <b>telemetric</b> <b>systems.</b> An inverse relationship exists between the velocity corresponding to VO 2 max and the time a swimmer can sustain it at this velocity. The energy cost of swimming varies according to its association with velocity variability. As, in the end, the supply of oxygen (whose limitation may be due to central—O 2 delivery and transportation to the working muscles—or peripheral factors—O 2 diffusion and utilization in the muscles) is one of the critical factors that determine swimming performance, VO 2 kinetics and its maximal values are critical in understanding swimmers’ behavior in competition and to develop efficient training programs...|$|R
