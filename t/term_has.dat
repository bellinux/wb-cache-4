5|$|In contrast, air {{furnaces}} (such as reverberatory furnaces) {{are naturally}} aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in a chimney flue. According to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt mills for lead would {{be classified as}} blast furnaces. However, the <b>term</b> <b>has</b> usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used {{in the production of}} commercial iron and steel, and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting.|$|E
5|$|In later times, the <b>term</b> <b>has</b> {{continued}} {{to be used to}} describe conservative letter writers who complain to newspapers about a subject that they morally or personally disagree with.

5|$|The city {{gave its}} name to a musical genre known as the Canterbury Sound or Canterbury Scene, a group of {{progressive}} rock, avant-garde and jazz musicians established within the city during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Some very notable Canterbury bands were Soft Machine, Caravan, Matching Mole, Egg, Hatfield and the North, National Health, Gilgamesh, Soft Heap, Khan, Camel and In Cahoots. Over the years, with band membership changes and new bands evolving, the <b>term</b> <b>has</b> been used to describe a musical style or subgenre, rather than a regional group of musicians.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, law {{enforcement}} in the counties of Croatia included county pandurs or hussars who patrolled roads and pursued criminals. In 1740, the term was applied to frontier guard duty infantry deployed in the Croatian Military Frontier (Banal Frontier), specifically its Karlovac and Varaždin Generalcies. The role of the pandurs as security guards was extended to Dalmatia after the establishment of Austrian rule there in the early 19th century. The <b>term</b> <b>has</b> dropped from official use for law enforcement officials, but it is still used colloquially in Croatia and the Western Balkans in a manner akin to the English word cop. The unit raised and led by Trenck is also referred to more specifically as Trenck's Pandurs, and less frequently in Croatia than elsewhere, as Croatian Pandurs.|$|E
5|$|Sejmiks {{were usually}} {{held in a}} large, open field. The nobility would elect a {{presiding}} officer (marszałek sejmiku: sejmik marshal), whose role was analogous to the marshal of the sejm at national Sejms. (This <b>term</b> <b>has</b> been revived since 1999, but it now refers to {{the chairman of the}} voivodeship executive board rather than the presiding officer of the sejmik itself.) While the sejmiks were originally convened by the king, soon a loophole was exploited: the sejmiks would limit the number of issues discussed, using that as a pretext to reconvene later at a time chosen by the marshal. Voivodes and starosts also had the ability to convene some sejmiks. Until the reforms of the Constitution of 3 May, all the nobility residing in the territory that was holding a sejmik were eligible to participate in the sejmik.|$|E
5|$|The first New Jersey State Constitution, {{ratified}} in 1776, {{provided that}} a governor be elected annually {{by the state}} legislature, the members of which were selected by the several counties. Under this constitution, the governor {{was president of the}} upper house of the legislature, then called the Legislative Council. The 1844 constitution provided for a popular vote to elect the governor, who no longer presided over the upper house of the legislature, now called the Senate. The 1844 constitution also lengthened the governor's term to three years, set to start on the third Tuesday in January following an election, and barred governors from succeeding themselves. The 1947 constitution extended terms to four years, and limits governors from being elected to more than two consecutive terms, though they can run again after a third <b>term</b> <b>has</b> passed.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin and}} {{usage of the}} term {{metalloid}} is convoluted. Its origin lies in attempts, dating from antiquity, to describe metals and to distinguish between typical and less typical forms. It was first applied in the early 19th century to metals that floated on water (sodium and potassium), and then more popularly to nonmetals. Earlier usage in mineralogy, to describe a mineral having a metallic appearance, can be sourced to as early as 1800. Since the mid-20th century {{it has been used}} to refer to intermediate or borderline chemical elements. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) previously recommended abandoning the term metalloid, and suggested using the term semimetal instead. Use of this latter <b>term</b> <b>has</b> more recently been discouraged by Atkins et al. as it has a different meaning in physics—one that more specifically refers to the electronic band structure of a substance rather than the overall classification of an element. The most recent IUPAC publications on nomenclature and terminology do not include any recommendations on the usage of the terms metalloid or semimetal.|$|E
