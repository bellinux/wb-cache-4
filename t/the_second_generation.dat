5|$|Rivalry came {{predominantly}} {{from the}} Ford Falcon—also locally built. Prior to <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> Commodore of 1988, the Holden was positioned a full class below the full-size Falcon. To varying degrees, competition also came from mid-size offerings from Toyota Australia {{as well as}} Chrysler Australia, which morphed into Mitsubishi Motors Australia. Moreover, between 1989 and 1997, Australian federal government policy saw {{the launch of the}} Toyota Lexcen, which was a rebadged version of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> Commodore. With the introduction of the third generation in 1997, Holden implemented its largest export programs involving Commodore and its derivatives. In the Middle East, South Africa and Brazil, the Commodore sold as a Chevrolet. High-performance export versions followed in North America, sold as Pontiac and later Chevrolet. HSV also exported to the United Kingdom as Vauxhall, in the Middle East as Chevrolet Special Vehicles (CSV) and in New Zealand and Singapore as HSV.|$|E

5|$|The first {{design in}} <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>generation</b> of Italian dreadnoughts, the Conti di Cavour class was also {{designed}} by Edoardo Masdea.

Ten guns were arranged in twin turrets superfiring over triple turrets forward and aft, and a third triple turret was placed amidships. All thirteen guns could fire on the broadside, but the firing arcs for most of the guns were significantly improved.|$|E
