40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the regional incidence of the effects of public investment <b>in</b> <b>transportation</b> infrastructures <b>in</b> Portugal. Our methodological approach consists of estimating vector autoregressive (VAR) models for the national economy as well as for each of the five administrative regions in the country. In the regional models, both public investment <b>in</b> <b>transportation</b> infrastructures <b>in</b> the region and public investment <b>in</b> <b>transportation</b> infrastructures elsewhere are considered, thereby taking into consideration the potential existence of regional spillovers. Empirical results suggest that although public investment <b>in</b> <b>transportation</b> infrastructures has been a powerful instrument to promote long-term growth, it does so in a way that is rather unbalanced across regions. We show that public investment <b>in</b> <b>transportation</b> infrastructures has markedly contributed to the concentration of economic activity in Lisbon, the largest region in the country, and therefore has contributed markedly to the macrocephaly of the countr...|$|R
