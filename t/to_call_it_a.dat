5|$|As objects {{increasingly}} {{closer in}} size to Pluto were discovered in the region, it was argued that Pluto should be reclassified {{as one of the}} Kuiper belt objects, just as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta lost their planet status after the discovery of many other asteroids. On July 29, 2005, astronomers at Caltech announced the discovery of a new trans-Neptunian object, Eris, which was substantially more massive than Pluto and the most massive object discovered in the Solar System since Triton in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the tenth planet, although there was no official consensus at the time on whether <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> planet. Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet.|$|E

25|$|Many Christian {{denominations}} classify the Eucharist as a sacrament. Some Protestants prefer <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> ordinance, viewing <b>it</b> not as <b>a</b> specific {{channel of}} divine grace {{but as an}} expression of faith and of obedience to Christ.|$|R

25|$|In the Netherlands and Belgium, {{there are}} 100 to 200 records {{per year in}} an average year. In warm summers however, like 2005 and 2006, several {{thousand}} are recorded.

25|$|Unitarianism is {{also known}} for the {{rejection}} of several other Western Christian doctrines, including the doctrines of original sin, predestination, and the infallibility of the Bible. Unitarians in previous centuries accepted the doctrine of punishment in an eternal hell, but few do today. Mostly excluded, Unitarianism might be considered a part of Protestantism depending on one's stance or viewpoint; perhaps it is more accurate <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> part of Nontrinitarianism, or of both.|$|E
2500|$|The lack {{of success}} in {{determining}} the identity and cause of death of the Somerton Man had led authorities <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> [...] "unparalleled mystery" [...] and believe {{that the cause of}} death might never be known.|$|R

25|$|Slade {{returned}} to the UK in August 1976 to face the UK music business much changed from when they had left. Punk rock had now exploded and had become the dominant influence on youth culture and the music press. Despite Slade's {{reputation as one of}} the great high energy bands of their day, in this environment Slade had become irrelevant. Regardless, Slade were determined that they were now a better live act than ever and refused <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> day. The band began recording their seventh studio album in August. According to the Slade Fan Club, the band hoped to record a total of 16 tracks and pick the best to release on the album.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{after being}} accused of assaulting his former wife Petra Mollath, Gustl Mollath was tried at the District Court of Nürnberg-Fürth for aggravated assault and {{wrongful}} deprivation of personal liberty of his ex-wife as well as damage to property. The court considered the charges proven but acquitted Mollath {{on the basis of}} finding him criminally insane. A pivotal argument for Mollath's insanity, besides the general impression he made, was that he insisted his wife was involved in a complex system of tax evasion; the court came <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> paranoid belief system Mollath had developed, which led him to accuse many people of being part of a conspiracy and act irrationally and aggressively, namely puncturing car tires of people in a way that could lead to accidents.|$|E

25|$|According to Plutarch, Pericles faced, twice, serious accusations. The {{first one}} was just before the {{eruption}} of the Peloponnesian War and the second one was {{during the first year}} of the war, when he was punished with a fine, the amount of which was either fifteen or fifty talents. Before the war a bill was passed, on the motion of Dracontides, according to which Pericles should deposit his accounts of public moneys with the prytanes and the jurors should decide upon his case with ballots which had lain upon the altar of the goddess on the acropolis. This clause of the bill was however amended with the motion that the case be tried before fifteen hundred jurors in the ordinary way, whether one wanted <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> prosecution for embezzlement and bribery, or malversation.|$|E
500|$|Ultima Underworld {{has been}} cited as the first {{role-playing}} game to feature first-person action in a 3D environment, and it introduced technological innovations such as allowing the player to look up and down. Its design combines simulation elements with concepts from earlier CRPGs, including Wizardry and Dungeon Master, which led the game's designers <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> [...] "dungeon simulation". As such, the game is non-linear and allows for emergent gameplay.|$|E
500|$|Thief was {{the first}} PC stealth game to use light and sound as game mechanics, and {{combined}} complex artificial intelligence with simulation systems to allow for emergent gameplay. The game is notable for its use of first-person perspective for non-confrontational gameplay, which challenged the first-person shooter market and led the developers <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> [...] "first-person sneaker", while it also had influences in later stealth games such as Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell and Hitman.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} as a digital download on 20 August 2012, with an accompanying lyric video {{for the song}} being uploaded shortly after. NME described the song as [...] "taking the defining noise of 'bass music' and using it to create slinky, soft rock sex music." [...] The track review goes on <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> brilliant single and jokingly states that Muse have tamed the shark (following their declaration that Muse had jumped the shark with [...] "Survival").|$|E
500|$|Gather Together {{was not as}} {{critically}} acclaimed as Angelou's first autobiography, but received mostly positive reviews and was recognized as being better written than its predecessor. [...] The book's structure, consisting {{of a series of}} episodes tied together by theme and content, parallels the chaos of adolescence, which some critics feel makes it an unsatisfactory sequel to Caged Bird. [...] Rita's many physical movements throughout the book, which affects the book's organization and quality, has caused at least one critic <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> travel narrative.|$|E
500|$|... "Requiem" [...] {{was written}} {{as a way}} to {{potentially}} end the series. While filming was underway for the seventh season, many members of the crew felt that the show had entered into its final season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz later explained, [...] "There was a pretty strong sentiment inside and outside the show that it was time <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> day." [...] Eventually, it was decided that Mulder would be abducted {{at the end of the}} seventh season, leaving things open for the actor's return in 11 episodes the following year. They eventually replaced Duchovny's Mulder with Robert Patrick's John Doggett.|$|E

The density of molecular oxygen ions determined from the Cassini plasma spectrometer data ranges from 0.01 to 0.09 per cm3.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} controversies of the {{documentary}} {{is that the two}} principal protagonists in the controversy, the then incumbent Partido Popular and ETA refused {{to take part in the}} interviews. The former went so far as to request the organisers of the Donostia-San Sebastian International Film Festival to reconsider the film's suitability. This, in turn, has led some <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>an</b> incomplete documentary.|$|R
5000|$|Deborah Evans Price, of Billboard {{magazine}} {{reviewed the}} song favorably, calling the production [...] "light and breezy."

500|$|Phishing {{protection}} now integrates with Mozilla Firefox.

Symantec declined <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> [...] "flaw", stating it is recommended to use the Identity Safe with anti-phishing enabled.

500|$|Rita's many {{physical}} movements {{throughout the}} book causes Hagen <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> travel narrative. [...] According to Lupton, this movement also affects the book's organization and quality, making it a less satisfactory sequel to Caged Bird. [...] Angelou has responded to this criticism by stating that she attempted to capture [...] "the episodic, erratic nature of adolescence" [...] as she experienced this period in her life. McPherson agreed, states that Gather Together's structure {{is more complex than}} Caged Bird. Angelou's style in Gather Together is more mature and simplified, which allows her to better convey emotion and insight through, as McPherson described it, [...] "sharp and vivid word images".|$|E
