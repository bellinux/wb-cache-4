Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> move backwards in their mouth by inertia. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage. The enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey.|$|E

Continuous digesters have mechanical or hydraulic devices, depending on the level of solids in the material, to mix the contents, enabling the bacteria and <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> be in contact.

25|$|Five {{types of}} {{interactions}} between P. colobopterus wasps have been identified. Wasps may antennate, or {{touch each other}} with their antennae. They also demonstrate feeding behavior, where a wasp bearing food will offer <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> another wasp. Wasps may use their mandibles to request a feeding by biting the mandibles of another wasp; additionally, they may use their mandibles to groom another wasp by carefully moving them the mandibles over their nest mate’s body. Finally, wasps may use their mandibles to attack each other by biting another wasp’s body. Together, these interactions {{form the basis of}} the behavior of P. colobopterus. Research has demonstrated that queens rarely engage in interactions with workers except to request a feeding, and do not appear to regulate worker behavior.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of new foods or preparation methods went through several stages of understanding. Firstly cocoa was {{understood as a}} food and later as a pleasant taste.

Those three simple changes distinguished the chocolate consumed by the Spanish colonisers from the chocolate consumed by the natives. The same pattern occurs in other foods enjoyed at the time by the natives and Spanish. although none of those had an acceptance and a global demand in proportion similar to that of chocolate.|$|E
25|$|In early development, {{the queen}} lays eggs and {{takes care of}} larvae. Before the {{emergence}} of workers, the queen is responsible for feeding the brood. To feed developing larvae, the queen captures prey by incapacitation, trims it to an appropriate size for carrying, and brings {{it back to the}} nest to further malaxate the item. Males do not contribute to parental care. In fact, many males solicit liquids from developing larvae. Workers forage for food, capture and malaxate prey, defend territories, and monitor the distribution of resources among larvae. The larvae twitch back and forth in their nests {{to attract the attention of}} the workers and queens. When approached by adults, larvae reach back to expose their heads. If this reaction takes too long, workers give <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>to</b> another larvae.|$|E
