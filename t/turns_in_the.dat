5|$|Although {{set in a}} hospital, it uses {{no medical}} storylines; the action is {{produced}} {{by a series of}} soap opera-style twists and <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> personal lives of the characters. They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch-like scenes, or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasizing the body language of the characters. The show had eight writers. Two series were made by the Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4.|$|E
5|$|Bernard James Tindal Bosanquet (13 October 1877– 12 October 1936) was an English cricketer {{best known}} for inventing the googly, a {{delivery}} designed to deceive the batsman. When bowled, {{it appears to be}} a leg break, but after pitching the ball <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction to that which is expected, behaving as an off break instead. Bosanquet, who played first-class cricket for Middlesex between 1898 and 1919, appeared in seven Test matches for England as an all-rounder. He was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1905.|$|E
5|$|From the {{southern}} terminus at SH-7, {{the southern}} section of SH-74 goes due north to Elmore City, where it intersects with SH-29. After {{a couple of}} <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Elmore City area, the highway continues due north to Maysville and SH-19. Still continuing northward, the highway meets the southern terminus of State Highway 24, and continues into Purcell.|$|E

5000|$|At night, by the fire, The {{colors of}} the bushes And of the fallen leaves, Repeating {{themselves}}, <b>Turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room, Like <b>the</b> leaves themselves <b>Turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind. Yes: but {{the color of the}} heavy hemlocks Came striding. And I remembered the cry of the peacocks. The {{colors of the}}ir tails Were like <b>the</b> leaves themselves <b>Turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind, <b>In</b> <b>the</b> twilight wind. They swept over the room, Just as they flew from the boughs of the hemlocks Down to the ground. I heard them cry—the peacocks. Was it a cry against the twilight Or against <b>the</b> leaves themselves <b>Turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind, <b>Turning</b> as <b>the</b> flames <b>Turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire, <b>Turning</b> as the tails of <b>the</b> peacocks <b>Turned</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> loud fire, Loud as the hemlocks Full of the cry of the peacocks? Or was it a cry against the hemlocks? Out of the window, I saw how the planets gathered Like <b>the</b> leaves themselves <b>Turning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind. I saw how the night came, Came striding like the color of the heavy hemlocks I felt afraid. And I remembered the cry of the peacocks. It can be compared to imagist paintings of the period such as Klee's [...] "Blaue Nacht",http://imagesource.art.com/images/-/Paul-Klee/Blaue-Nacht-Print-C10078194.jpeg Klee's shades of blue replaced by Stevens' colors of the night. Stevens adds unsettling elements. The poem unfolds like a little horror show. A fire creates flickering images of the colors of bushes and leaves, which themselves <b>turn</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind. Also the color of heavy hemlocks [...] "came striding", as from the river Styx ("the Stygian hemlocks", in Vendler's phrase). Ambiguous peacocks descend from the hemlocks. Then the poet notices outside his window the planets gathering isomorphically, [...] "Like the leaves themselves", and the night came striding. The threat of darkness (death? suicide?) is palpable: [...] "I felt afraid." ...|$|R

5|$|As a {{preparation}} for the World Championships in Tuscany Van Dijk went during the season {{a few times to}} Italy to practise the time trial course. She trained at five in the morning to avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course {{to get to know the}} <b>turns.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> week before the World Championships she won the French time trial Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen. All the preparations paid off and the World Championships were very successful for Van Dijk. With her team she won for the second consecutive year the world title in the team time trial. Because Van Dijk had won almost all the time trials this year she was also the main favourite for the individual time trial. Despite the pressure she won the time trial with a convincing victory and became the second Dutch women to win this title. At the end of the championships, Van Dijk finished 16th on a non-preferable hilly road race course.|$|E
5|$|Concentric castles {{were widely}} copied across Europe, for {{instance}} when Edward I of England– who had himself been on Crusade– built castles in Wales {{in the late}} 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded had a concentric design. Not all {{the features of the}} Crusader castles from the 13thcentury were emulated in Europe. For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate in the side of a tower and for there to be two <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. It is rare for this bent entrance to be found in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The highway briefly {{parallels}} Fall Creek; however, it soon splits to {{the southeast}} at a junction with CR103 (Groton City Road). From here, NY222 continues on a generally southeasterly alignment along {{the base of a}} rural valley to the Tompkins–Cortland county line. Now in the town of Cortlandville, the route loses the Cortland Road name as it curves eastward to match similar <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course of the valley. The highway follows a winding course until the surrounding gully empties into the much wider Tioughnioga River valley, where the route straightens out and intersects with CR119 (Sears Road). East of this point, NY222 begins to run northeastward past homes as it approaches Cortland County–Chase Field Airport. The route provides direct access to the airport and subsequently meets NY281 (West Road) at the northeastern tip of the airport property.|$|E

5|$|Typically, the {{equipment}} used for SMAW {{consists of a}} step-down transformer and for direct current models a rectifier, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 V at 50 A, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45V at currents up to 600A. A number {{of different types of}} transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and inverter machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.|$|E
5|$|R.C. Pro-Am II was {{developed}} by Rare and published by Tradewest. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in December1992. Nintendo Power praised the game's controls and upgrade options, which made the game strategic. The magazine criticized the difficulty as unfair, with aircraft hazards that gave players no reaction time in which to dodge attacks. Nintendo Magazine System praised the game overall and its multiplayer in particular, but felt that better games were available. In 1993, GamePro said that the game was better than its predecessor, but noted that the graphics and sound could have been better. Jeuxvideo.com appreciated how the sequel's cars had better traction, but thought the game was technically unrefined considering its few advances in four years' time. For example, they criticized Rare for recycling the original game's audio. In 1994, Game Players had high praise for the game's multiplayer, screeching sound effects, vehicle handling, and replay value. They criticized its lack of in-game music and current weapon indicators, and struggled to anticipate <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> track in the game's angled perspective.|$|E
5|$|The Smoking Man {{meets with}} the Syndicate, who are {{responsible}} for the bees. Soon afterward a swarm of bees attacks a school in Columbia, South Carolina, and one of the teachers dies as a result. Skinner heads to the hospital, where he is met by Covarrubias. She demands to know what he knows about the matter. He tells her he believes that the bees are being used as a carrier for some sort of experiment. Skinner returns home where he is confronted by Mulder, who now suspects that Skinner has been working against him all this time. Skinner is able to convince Mulder that he would not have forced his own drawer lock open and hence could not have been the murderer. Convinced of Skinner's evidence, Mulder <b>turns</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gun with the serial number filed off so Skinner is not blamed for the murder. That night Skinner confronts The Smoking Man in his apartment, angry that nothing has been done for Scully. The Smoking Man convinces him that Scully will die if he kills him and Skinner leaves without killing him, but not before firing warning shots. Shortly afterwards Covarrubias calls The Smoking Man, who tells her to tell Mulder what he wants to hear while an unknown man is shown behind her listening on another phone.|$|E
