As Rambabu, Jyothi and Anju are {{severely}} injured, Geetha's husband, Prabhakar, asks her {{to put a stop}} to this. Out of fear, Anu reveals what she saw and Varun's friend describes the transgression at the camp. After digging up <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> pit, the police find the carcass of a pig instead of Varun's body, indicating that Rambabu had already moved it. Jyothi's brother, Rajesh, and her father call the media and Anu complains to them about Veerabhadram's ill-treatment of her family. After Veerabhadram manhandles Rambabu and his relatives, he is beaten by the local people who learn about him from the media. Rambabu's goodwill remains intact and all the locals extend their support to him. Veerabhadram is suspended, the remaining staff transferred, and Geetha resigns from her post as IG.|$|E

25|$|Once {{composting}} {{is complete}} (or more often), <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> {{must be removed}} from the unit.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{was to develop a}} {{methodology}} of stydying <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> process and also an index that predicts <b>the</b> stage of <b>composting</b> in a product. A respirometric method was used for studying the microbial succession mesophilic and thermophilic that grows during <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> of Olive Press Cake.

It was observed that at a raw material its the mesophilic population that established to the material, but us <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> process proceeds <b>the</b> thermophilic community adapts (due to the high temperature) to the substrate. At the same time the respiration rate is restricted indicating the substrate depletion.

30|$|In {{light of}} all the above, this study was {{initiated}} by establishing a total of seven pilot scale indoor and outdoor static composting windrows that consisted of three agro-industrial waste streams, namely olive cake (the solid by-product of olive processing), grain dust, and coffee-barley, or mixtures thereof. The purpose was to examine <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> and co-composting kinetics by monitoring the degradation process in terms of volatile solids (VS) content, temperature and moisture variations of the windrows over <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> periods. Composting kinetics modeling is necessary to design and operate composting facilities that comply with strict market demands and stringent environmental regulations (Hamelers 2004). This can be achieved once <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> kinetics is well understood. (Hamoda et al. 1998). Proper modeling of the progress of substrate degradation is of great importance in the prediction of operating variable of <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> process. One {{of the most commonly}} used approaches in modeling <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> kinetics is <b>the</b> substrate degradation models, where the independent variable is either the quantity or concentration of the substrate remaining. In the present study, remaining amount of the substrate was selected as indicator to model <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> kinetics and to find out which reaction order <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> kinetics follow.|$|R

500|$|William Golding's 1954 novel Lord of the Flies {{was written}} as a {{counterpoint}} to (or even a parody of) The Coral Island, and Golding makes explicit references to it. At {{the end of}} the novel, for instance, one of the naval officers who rescues the children mentions the book, commenting on the hunt for one of their number, Ralph, as a [...] "jolly good show. Like the Coral Island". Jack also makes an appearance in Lord of the Flies as Jack Merridew, representing the irrational nature of the boys. Indeed, Golding's three central characters– Ralph, Piggy and Jack– are caricatures of Ballantyne's heroes. Despite having enjoyed The Coral Island many times as a child, Golding strongly disagreed with the views that it espoused, and in contrast Lord of the Flies depicts the English boys as savages themselves, who forget more than they learn, unlike Ballantyne's boys. Golding described {{the relationship between the two}} books by saying that The Coral Island [...] "rotted to compost" [...] in his mind, and in <b>the</b> <b>compost</b> [...] "a new myth put down roots". Neither is the idyllic nature of Ballantyne's coral island to be found on Stevenson's treasure island, which is unsuitable for settlement [...] "but exists merely as a site from which to excavate treasure, a view consistent with the late-Victorian imperial mission" [...] according to Honaker.|$|E

30|$|The initial pH {{of all the}} straws and {{saw dust}} was low ranging from 6 to 7 and this pH further dropped between days 1 – 10 of <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> process, i.e., when the {{temperatures}} in all <b>the</b> <b>composting</b> reactors were high because of increased microbial fermentation activity (Fig.  2).
