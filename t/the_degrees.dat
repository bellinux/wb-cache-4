5|$|Freemasonry or Masonry {{consists}} of fraternal organisations that trace their origins {{to the local}} fraternities of stonemasons, which {{from the end of}} the fourteenth century regulated the qualifications of stonemasons and their interaction with authorities and clients. <b>The</b> <b>degrees</b> of freemasonry retain the three grades of medieval craft guilds, those of Apprentice, Journeyman or fellow (now called Fellowcraft), and Master Mason. These are <b>the</b> <b>degrees</b> offered by Craft (or Blue Lodge) Freemasonry. Members of these organisations are known as Freemasons or Masons. There are additional degrees, which vary with locality and jurisdiction, and are usually administered by different bodies than the craft degrees.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>degree</b> {{partition}} {{of a simple}} graph is its degree sequence rearranged in weakly decreasing order. <b>The</b> polytope of <b>degree</b> partitions (respectively, <b>degree</b> sequences) is <b>the</b> convex hull of all degree partitions (respectively, degree sequences) of a fixed length. We think of <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> sequence polytope as the symmetrization of <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> partition polytope and <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> partition polytope as the asymmetric part of <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> sequence polytope. <b>The</b> <b>degree</b> sequence polytope is a well studied object with formulas (generating functions) known for its face numbers, volume, and number of lattice points.

In particular, <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> partition polytope on n vertices has 2 ^{n- 1 } extreme points. Comment: 21 page...|$|R

5|$|Any {{counting}} formula involving vertices {{and faces}} that is valid for all planar graphs may be transformed by planar duality into an equivalent formula {{in which the}} roles of the vertices and faces have been swapped. Euler's formula, which is self-dual, is one example. Another given by Harary involves the handshaking lemma, according to which the sum of <b>the</b> <b>degrees</b> of the vertices of any graph equals twice the number of edges. In its dual form, this lemma states that in a plane graph, the sum of the numbers of sides of the faces of the graph equals twice the number of edges.|$|E

5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Grand Lodge era, during the 1720s, James Anderson {{composed}} the first printed constitutions for Freemasons, the basis for most subsequent constitutions, which specifically excluded women from Freemasonry. As Freemasonry spread, continental masons began to include their ladies in Lodges of Adoption, which worked three degrees with the same names as the men's but different content. The French officially abandoned the experiment in the early 19th century. Later organisations with a similar aim emerged in the United States, but distinguished the names of <b>the</b> <b>degrees</b> from those of male masonry.|$|E

5|$|At this point, Grant began {{describing}} {{himself as}} the O.H.O. (Outer Head of the Order) of the O.T.O., claiming that he deserved this title not by direct succession from Crowley but because he displayed the inspiration and innovation that Germer lacked. A document purportedly by Crowley naming Grant as his successor was subsequently exposed as a hoax created by Robert Taylor, a Typhonian O.T.O. member. In the early 1970s he established his own Thelemic organisation, the Typhonian O.T.O., which produced its first official announcement in 1973. Although adopting the O.T.O. degree system used by Crowley, Grant removed the rituals of initiation designed to allow a member to enter a higher degree; instead he personally promoted them through <b>the</b> <b>degrees</b> according to what he believed were their own personal spiritual development.|$|E
5|$|The {{requisite}} Papal dispensation {{was obtained}} dated 22 April 1472. Michael Hicks {{has suggested that}} the terms of the dispensation deliberately understated <b>the</b> <b>degrees</b> of consanguinity between the couple, and the marriage was therefore illegal on the ground of first degree consanguinity following George's marriage to Anne's sister Isabel. First degree consanguinity applied in the case of Henry VIII and his brother's widow Catherine of Aragon. In their case the papal dispensation was obtained after Catherine declared the first marriage had not been consummated. In Richard's case, there would have been first degree consanguinity if Richard had sought to marry Isabel (in case of widowhood) after she had married his brother George, but no such consanguinity applied for Anne and Richard. Richard's marriage to Anne was never declared null, and it was public to everyone including secular and canon lawyers for 13 years.|$|E
