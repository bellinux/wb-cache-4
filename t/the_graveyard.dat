5000|$|<b>The</b> first Jewish <b>graveyard</b> {{was laid}} out in the early 19th century. By the middle of that century, it was already filled with graves, and the Jewish {{community}} applied to expand it. This application was approved, and then implemented about 1880. It may have been expanded once again. <b>The</b> <b>graveyard's</b> area is 740 m² and 19 gravestones are still preserved. Datable stones come from 1873 to 1924. In 1912, another Jewish <b>graveyard,</b> adjacent to <b>the</b> Christian <b>graveyard,</b> without any delimitation, {{was laid out}} on the outer, right-hand side of <b>the</b> Christian <b>graveyard.</b> <b>The</b> last burial in <b>the</b> Jewish <b>graveyard</b> was in 1935 (Fanny Kahn née Strauss, died on 13 November 1935). Preserved here are twelve graves with seven readable gravestones. During the Third Reich, <b>the</b> <b>graveyards</b> were not destroyed. <b>The</b> old <b>graveyard</b> lies west of the village in the forest, in the cadastral area [...] "Am Judenkirchhof", lot 1628, while <b>the</b> new <b>graveyard</b> lies north of the village within <b>the</b> Christian <b>graveyard,</b> in <b>the</b> cadastral area [...] "Am Feilerpfad", lot 1248.|$|R

30|$|Tao {{people call}} Birdwing {{butterflies}} “pahapahad no anito”, {{which means the}} soul or messenger of evil spirits. The larvae of Birdwing butterflies only eat Aristolochia; in the past, many Aristolochia zollingeriana have been planted in <b>the</b> <b>graveyards</b> of Orchid Island. Therefore, many Birdwing butterflies lay their eggs in <b>the</b> <b>graveyards.</b> <b>The</b> adult Birdwing butterflies preferentially feed on the white flowers of Sea Mango trees; this plant is also usually present in <b>the</b> <b>graveyards</b> of <b>the</b> Tao people. Because the Tao people have observed that Birdwing butterflies commonly fly around the tribe’s forbidden areas, they regard them as souls or messengers of evil spirits. They believe {{that people who are}} close to them or catch them will be possessed by evil spirits and will bring misfortunate.|$|R

5|$|By the 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>graveyard</b> {{was full}} {{and had become}} a public health concern. It was overrun with rats, and dogs chasing the rats, {{both of which were}} {{damaging}} the churchyard. Finding sufficient ground for new burials was increasingly difficult and bones were often removed to a nearby charnel house. In 1849, an extra charge was put on burials of people from outside the parish. In 1884, the churchyard was closed to all burials and a cemetery was opened in the town.|$|E

5|$|Hebron Church is {{surrounded}} {{on three sides}} by a graveyard, consisting of about 700 granite, marble, slate and wooden headstones laid in semi-regular rows running northeast to southeast. <b>The</b> <b>graveyard</b> also abuts the northeastern elevation of the community building. Its interments date from about 1806 to the present; early headstones have deteriorated beyond recognition, and may be older than 1806. Slaves and other people of color are interred in a small area of the graveyard's southeastern section, with simpler markers than the cemetery's other headstones. Although its headstones are generally rectangular granite stones and large obelisks, the graveyard's earliest headstones were simple wooden boards. Several gravestones are ornately carved, including one modeled on a tree stump. <b>The</b> <b>graveyard</b> is active, with the most recent burials at the property's northern end. Dr. William Blum, Sr., an electrochemist at the National Bureau of Standards who invented a chrome plating technique used in banknote printing, is interred at the cemetery.|$|E

5|$|People {{associated}} with the church include Henry Maurice (elected Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford {{shortly before his death}} in 1691; his father, Thomas, was the perpetual curate of the church) and the 19th-century writer and priest Owen Wynne Jones (who was the curate for a time in the early 1860s).

5|$|At one time, three churches {{stood on}} Hirta. Christ Church, in {{the site of}} <b>the</b> <b>graveyard</b> at {{the centre of the}} village, was in use in 1697 and was the largest, but this thatched-roof {{structure}} was too small to hold the entire population, and most of the congregation had to gather in the churchyard during services. St Brendan's Church lay over a kilometre away on the slopes of Ruival, and St Columba's at the west end of the village street, but little is left of these buildings. A new kirk and manse were erected at the east end of the village in 1830 and a Factor's house in 1860.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1900s, <b>the</b> <b>graveyard</b> was overshadowed on its {{northern}} side by a warehouse {{built on the}} Quay Street site of the Byrom family residence. The area had been residential—Richard Cobden {{was among those who}} lived nearby and attended the church—but changed in character during the 19th century, as many homes once occupied by affluent families became lodging houses and the locale became increasingly a place of business. Those who did live there, or were patients in the nearby hospitals, were poor and unable to contribute significantly to the funds of the church and its schools. Fundraising bazaars were held in the 1890s and 1900s at the Free Trade Hall, in a nearby area that was more salubrious.|$|E
