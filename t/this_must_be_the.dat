500|$|The first {{explanation}} {{given for}} Kenny's deaths and reappearances {{was given in}} [...] "Cartman Joins NAMBLA", wherein the McCormicks have a baby exactly like Kenny, including the characteristic orange parka, shortly after the former Kenny dies. Mr. McCormick exclaims, [...] "God, <b>this</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> fiftieth time this has happened", to which Mrs. McCormick quickly replies, [...] "Fifty-second". This explanation is expanded upon in the Season 14 episodes [...] "", [...] "Mysterion Rises" [...] and [...] "Coon vs. Coon and Friends", in which Kenny, while playing superheroes with his friends, claims his [...] "super power" [...] is immortality. He actually dies several times during these episodes—even committing suicide more than once—reawakening alive and unharmed in his bed each time. He is frustrated and angry {{that no one can}} remember him dying every time he regenerates, and longs to know the source of his power, which he views as a curse. Unbeknownst to him, his parents were previously connected to a Cthulhu-worshipping death cult. After Kenny shoots himself the second time, Mrs. McCormick awakes with a scream, shrieks [...] "It's happening again!", and minutes later, is shown gently placing a newborn Kenny in his bed. [...] "We should never have gone to that stupid cult meeting," [...] she grouses as she and her husband return to bed.|$|E
500|$|Several {{references}} to the Cure and their music {{have been made in}} popular culture. A number of films have used the title of a Cure song as the film's title, including Boys Don't Cry (1999) and Just Like Heaven (2005). The Cure's gloomy image {{has been the subject of}} parody at times. In series two of The Mighty Boosh, the Moon sings [...] "The Love Cats" [...] over the credits. In the same episode, a powerful gothic hairspray, Goth Juice, is said to be [...] "the most powerful hairspray known to man. Made from the tears of Robert Smith." [...] The Mary Whitehouse Experience often featured brief clips of the stars of the show performing comical songs and nursery rhymes as the Cure in a morose style. Robert Smith appeared in the final episode of the second series of The Mary Whitehouse Experience singing [...] "The sun has got his hat on" [...] before punching the character Ray (played by Robert Newman) whilst uttering Ray's catchphrase [...] "Oh no, what a personal disaster". While not a parody, Robert Smith was the inspiration for the lead character of the film <b>This</b> <b>Must</b> <b>Be</b> <b>the</b> Place. Robert Smith was also portrayed on the South Park episode [...] "Mecha-Streisand" [...] (for which he himself provided the voice-over), where he transforms into the form of Mothra and battles Mecha-Streisand to save the day. As Smith leaves, the character of Kyle shouts, [...] "Disintegration is the best album ever!" ...|$|E

500|$|Both musicians {{continued}} {{to work on their}} own projects during the composition of Everything ThatHappens WillHappen Today. Byrne [...] of BigLove and completed his collaborations with Fatboy Slim on the album and musical HereLiesLove and the single [...] "ToeJam". Eno produced Coldplay's VivalaVida or DeathandAllHisFriends and U2's NoLineontheHorizon. Byrne and Eno discussed the former's collaboration with FatboySlim and ChrisMartin of Coldplay wrote lyrics to the instrumental track for [...] "OneFineDay", but acquiesced when he heard Byrne's version (the band would also adapt another one of Eno's instrumental compositions that Byrne did not finish into a track on VivalaVida). Once Byrne's version of [...] "OneFineDay" [...] was finished, the two began in earnest writing the rest of the tracks. Byrne initially had a long delay in writing material, but as the project progressed, he got to working several hours a day on the album and put his collaboration with FatboySlim on hold to finish the songs {{in the early part of}} 2008. Since the two did not work together face-to-face as they had in the past, it was harder for them to complete material quickly, and they had to rush to complete two of the tracks were finished at the end of the sessions. He later described the process as easy once details were sort out and summed up this method as [...] "purejoy" [...] and declared writing collaboratively to be easier than writing solo. He even credited the time between their last collaboration and the transatlantic distance as a strength, since it allowed the two to keep their own schedules. Eno agreed, as it gave him time to focus on a small piece of music without holding up Byrne's progress. Byrne later used a similar approach through 2010 and 2011 in collaborations with St.Vincent (Love This Giant) and WillOldham (the soundtrack to <b>This</b> <b>Must</b> <b>Be</b> <b>the</b> Place).|$|E

2500|$|According to Delamater, Kelly's work [...] "seems to {{represent}} the fulfillment of dance-film integration in the 1940s and 1950s". While Fred Astaire had revolutionized the filming of dance in the 1930s by insisting on full-figure photography of dancers while allowing only a modest degree of camera movement, Kelly freed up the camera, making greater use of space, camera movement, camera angles and editing, creating a partnership between dance movement and camera movement without sacrificing full-figure framing. Kelly's reasoning behind this was that he felt the kinetic force of live dance often evaporated when brought to film, and he sought to partially overcome this by involving the camera in movement and giving the dancer {{a greater number of}} directions in which to move. Examples of this abound in Kelly's work and are well illustrated in the [...] "Prehistoric Man" [...] sequence from On the Town and [...] "The Hat My Father Wore on St. Patrick's Day" [...] from Take Me Out to the Ball Game. In 1951, he summed up his vision as follows: [...] "If the camera is to make a contribution at all to dance, <b>this</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> focal point of its contribution; the fluid background, giving each spectator an undistorted and altogether similar view of dancer and background. To accomplish this, the camera is made fluid, moving with the dancer, so that the lens becomes the eye of the spectator, your eye".|$|E

2500|$|Hayashi's {{first task}} as the Superintendent-General was {{to lay down}} a new {{mind-set}} for the NPR, since the [...] "spiritual training" [...] (seishin kyoiku) in the prewar Imperial Japanese Army had been scrapped. Although the post-war forces were no longer be required to pledge absolute allegiance to the Emperor under the post-war [...] "Peace Constitution", the general public was still unfamiliar with the democracy concept that was newly introduced to them and therefore, {{it was difficult to}} follow the practice of the US to inject democracy concept into the fundamental mind-set of the NPR. As the senior management of the NPR was deeply anxious about the lack of a new and appropriate mind-set, Hayashi attempted to explore one by striking a balance between old and new concepts. The new mind-set was finally introduced in a speech he made in March 1951, in which he emphasized, [...] "The fundamental spirit of the NPR I firmly hold [...] patriotism and love of our race". He pointed out that the NPR was loyal to the country and the people, instead of the Emperor. In another speech to the officers of the NPR, he said, [...] "Needless to say, if this organization is to play its rightful role in the new Japan, it must be ‘an organization of the people.’ <b>This</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> fundamental principle upon which this defense force should be established" [...] By formulating the new mind-set, he connected the new post-war defense force with the people and cut-off its lineage with the prewar Japanese armed forces.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, Santos had {{the lead}} role in Kahit Isang Saglit. She portrayed Annie, a budding {{architect}} romantically torn between two best friends (played by Piolo Pascual and Leandro Munoz). The film received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Santos and Pascual. Santos next appearance with Pascual was in the 2001 television series Sa Puso Ko Iingatan Ka as Patricia Montecillo, an illegitimate daughter in a constant struggle for acceptance and independence, dealing with an alcoholic abusive stepfather. Dez Lucero from Chic commended Santos' breakthrough and innovative portrayal, [...] "Patricia [...] here is a fighter who stands up to anyone bent on demolishing her [...] she is a survivor, she is sarcastic, she is street smart, she is strong." [...] Asked what she hoped to accomplish in the drama series, Santos stated, [...] "After seeing me cry for years, I think the public now wants me to make them laugh." [...] In the same year, Santos released her second album Bida Ng Buhay Ko. Singles from the album included [...] "Hello Goodbye", [...] "This Song's Dedicated To You", and [...] "Stop! Before You Break My Heart". The album was met with negative reviews. David Gonzales of AllMusic.com gave the album {{one out of five}} stars, stating, [...] "Santos is a popular young film actress, and <b>this</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> reason why she has a recording contract. It isn't because of her singing, which ranges from bad to terrible. She sings in a low, whispery voice and hits many off-key notes throughout the album, which makes a listener cringe. Her voice is often difficult to hear above the backing instrumentation, but at least this spares a listener from more misery." [...] The album achieved moderate success, eventually certified platinum.|$|E
