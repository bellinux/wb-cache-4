The designs all yield improvements {{in size and}} mass compared to the STS, provided certain emerging technologies are successfully applied. Single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) vehicles would burn LOX/LH fuels in SSME-derived engines with two position nozzles. SSTO could be realized in either vertical or horizontal <b>take-off</b> <b>configurations,</b> but all would have 29, 500 kg payload capacities and horizontal landing capabilities.

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{analysis of}} {{several types of}} rigid winglet geometries was cariied out at cruise condition using a rapid databased aerodynamic prediction method. The optimised configurations were obtained according to an effective drag approach, which takes into account aerodynamic improvements and structural penalties. The most promising device found was a highly swept, off-loaded anhedral wing tip device with a reduced chord length. For low speed assessment study, both clean and <b>take-off</b> <b>configurations</b> were used. The designed winglet has shown poor flow behaviour at low spped regime due to the design objetive at cruise. To improve the performance at low speed, moving parts and redesigned winglet airfoils were performed. The design study of both geometry modifications is described. The results obtained were confirmed by RANS computations. The resulting geometry provides great benefit at high and low speeds relative to the reference geometry. additionally, a brief design work of a conventional wing tip device was conducted {{to gain a better}} understanding of the benefit of the anhedral winglet. Finally, a wing tip shape study was carried out using a Shark winglet...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{airframe}} noise of civil transport aircraft is numerically evaluated and compared with measurements taken in some european airports with {{the target of}} separating the airframe contribution from other noise contributions effective on a typical aircraft. The attention {{has been focused on}} airframe noise since it sets a lower limit below whichever reduction of noise generated by engine have no significant effect on the overall noise level perceived by an observer and due to the aircraft flyover. The intensity of airframe noise depends on the aircraft configuration: during the cruise the aircraft exhibit an aerodynamically ‘clean’ configuration that produces less noise than the configuration assumed by the aircraft during landing and take-off, that usually is referred as ‘dirty’ one. The configuration with slats extended, flaps down and undercarriage lowered is more noisy than the clean configuration. In this paper the results of numerical simulations performed on common operating aircraft are presented: these simulations allow the contribution breakdown and, therefore, the classification of the most noisy airframe components for the different approach and <b>take-off</b> <b>configurations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Flight {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate various aerodynamic characteristics of the Quiet Short-Haul Research Aircraft (QSRA), an experimental aircraft that makes use of the upper-surface blown (USB) powered-lift concept. Time-history records from maneuvers performed with the aircraft in landing-approach and <b>take-off</b> <b>configurations</b> (with its stability augmentation system disengaged) were analyzed to obtain longitudinal stability and control derivatives and performance characteristics. The experiments included measuring the aircraft responses to variations in the deflection of direct-lift control spoilers and to thrust variations {{as well as to}} elevator inputs. The majority of the results are given for the aircraft in a landing configuration with the USB flaps at 50 degrees. For this configuration, if the static longitudinal stability is defined as the variation of the pitching-moment coefficient with the lift coefficient at a constant thrust coefficient, this stability decreases significantly with increasing angle of attack above 9 degrees. For this configuration, at small and negative angles of attack and high levels of thrust, the elevators and the horizontal stabilizer lost effectiveness owing to incipent stalling, but this occurred only during unsteady maneuvers and for brief time intervals...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of a four-engine externally blown flap (EBF) powered-lift transport was conducted in the Langley V/STOL tunnel {{to determine the effect}} of different engine configurations on the longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics. The different engine configurations were simulated by five different sets of propulsion simulators on a single aircraft model. Longitudinal aerodynamic data were obtained for each simulator on each flap deflection corresponding to cruise, take-off, and landing at a range of angles of attack and various thrust coefficients. The bypass ratio (BPR) 6. 2 engine simulator provided the best lift and drag characteristics of the five simulators tested in the <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>configurations.</b> The poor performance of the BPR 10. 0 and 3. 2 engine simulators can be attributed to a mismatch of engine-model sizes or poor engine location and orientation. Isolated engine wake surveys indicated that a reasonable assessment of the aerodynamic characteristics of an engine-wing-flap configuration could be made if qualitative information were available which defined the engine wake characteristics. All configurations could be trimmed easily with relatively small horizontal-tail incidence angles; however, the <b>take-off</b> landing <b>configurations</b> required a high-lift tail...|$|R

For this purpose, a three-segment variable camber airfoil employed as a performance adaptive aeroelastic wing shaping control effector for a NASA Generic Transport Model (GTM) in landing and <b>take-off</b> <b>configurations</b> is considered. The objective of the study is to define optimal high-lift VCCTEF settings and VCK settings/configurations. A total of 224 combinations of VCK settings/configurations and VCCTEF settings are considered for the inboard GTM wing, where the VCCTEFs are configured as a Fowler flap that forms a slot between the VCCTEF and the main wing. For the VCK settings of deflection angles of 55 deg, 60 deg and 65 deg, 18, 19 and 19 vck configurations, respectively, were considered for each of the 4 different VCCTEF deflection settings. Different vck configurations were defined by varying the horizontal and vertical distance of the vck from the main wing. A computational investigation using a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver was carried out to complement a wind-tunnel experimental study covering three of these configurations with the goal of identifying the most optimal high-lift configurations. Four most optimal high-lift configurations, corresponding to each of the VCK deflection settings, have been identified out of all the different configurations considered in this study yielding the highest lift performance...|$|R

50|$|The FDR and the CVR {{were found}} {{and sent to}} Washington to be read out by the NTSB in United States. They were found in good condition; however, the team {{experienced}} difficulty reading the Cockpit Area Microphone (CAM). The team {{also found that the}} channel from the CAM was masked by hum and noise dominating the signal. There were some voices heard on the CAM track; {{there were a number of}} step changes in background noise level and character that may have been consistent with an intermittent electrical connection in the CAM wiring circuit. As a result, the team was not able to conclude that the CAM was providing input to the CVR throughout the entire 30 minutes. Such a poor quality in CVR record failure makes it impossible to find out whether the flight crews made proper <b>take-off</b> <b>configuration</b> procedures including checklist execution. However several crew words, cockpit switch activations, engine noise, and cabin chime sounds heard on the CAM channel of the CVR were typically at a volume level much lower than the standard take off warning horn of the Boeing 737-200. The typical sound of the <b>take-off</b> <b>configuration</b> warning was not heard in the CVR CAM channel. The stick-shaker warning (typically as loud as or louder than the takeoff warning horn) was also not heard on the CVR CAM channel.|$|E
5000|$|On September 26, 1989, the NTSB {{published}} {{its final}} accident report.

Contributing to the crash was Delta's slow implementation of changes to its flight crew management programs, a lack of sufficiently aggressive FAA action to compel Delta to correct known deficiencies, and a lack of sufficient accountability within the FAA's air carrier inspection process.|$|E
40|$|Frequency domain {{analysis}} {{is applied to}} a wave energy device composed by two coaxial axisymmetric bodies.

50|$|The NTSB {{examined}} why {{the plane}} was unable to climb once it departed the runway. After conducting airplane performance studies, the NTSB determined that the events of Flight 1141 could only {{be explained by the}} aircraft attempting to take off without its flaps and slats extended to the proper <b>take-off</b> <b>configuration.</b> The aircraft's instability and sudden roll to the right was consistent with known performance of the Boeing 727 with the flaps and slats retracted. The captain continued to pull back on the control column in an attempt to keep the plane's nose raised, which created turbulence over the rear-mounted engines and caused the compressor surges. However, the NTSB concluded that the compressor surges would not have significantly reduced the engines' thrust, and that the plane's failure to gain speed was due to aerodynamic drag on the aircraft due to the high angle of attack, rather than a loss of engine thrust. The NTSB examined the CVR and noted that neither pilot is heard announcing the deployment of the flaps or slats, nor is the sound of the flap lever movement heard. The NTSB considered it extremely unlikely that a pilot would have moved either the flaps or the slats without announcing their actions {{to the rest of the}} flight crew. Based on the aircraft's failure to climb at takeoff speed, its roll instability, and the absence of sounds indicating the flaps or slats were deployed, the NTSB determined that the plane's failure to climb resulted from the flight crew's failure to deploy the flaps and slats as required by the pre-flight checklist.|$|E
