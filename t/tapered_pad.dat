40|$|Thrust {{bearings}} {{are designed}} to support the axial loads generated by the rotating component of turbomachinary like turbocharger and turboexpander. Aerodynamic gas thrust bearing like tilting pad, <b>tapered</b> <b>pad,</b> grooved has been successfully designed and developed. Previously it was difficult and costly to generate spiral grooves but now it easily be developed with laser machining process. Current research target to design and develop an alternative aerodynamic grooved thrust bearing with spiral pattern to find pressure profile, load carrying capacity and friction coefficient etc. In this analysis Reynolds Equation is solved by using the Finite Difference Method (FDM) to get the pressure distribution {{over the surface of}} the spiral grooved bearing. After the pressure distribution is known, load carrying capacity and friction coefficient is calculated and their variation with different parameters are presented. The suitability of designed bearing is checked for the designed turboexpander. Here the resultant axial thrust load is calculated for the designed micro turboexpander and this axial thrust load is compared with the load carrying capacity of the designed bearing. The author believe that the detail and procedural analysis will help the researchers to design and develop more alternative gas bearing for micromachinary like turbocharger and turboexpander etc...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{application}} of thermovision in endodontics is an innovative method {{and has a}} great informative value, evidence proved, thanks {{to the use of}} last generation camera Flir A 310 and software ThermaCam Reporter 8. 3 Pro. In the recent years a new method of root canal disinfection is introduced – photo-activated disinfection (PAD). Temperature increase have always been a concern during dental laser treatment. Aim: The purpose of our study is to evaluate the temperature elevation on the outer root surface at extracted teeth and in periapical tissues when photodynamic therapy with 630 -nm diode laser is used for root canal disinfection. Materials and methods: For the laboratory study we used 72 single-rooted freshly extracted human teeth. They were divided into six groups depending on the power of the light source (220 mW, 360 mW and 500 mW) and the type of photosensitizer agent – Fotosan and Zn-phtalocianine. In our clinical study participated 8 patients, who came in to our clinic with complaints of spontaneous pain or were with infected root canals and were referred for endodontic treatment. PAD was performed with a diode laser with wavelength of 630 nm using an endodontic handpiece with fiberoptic connector, allowing penetration to 4 mm from the apical stop, and movements of fibreoptic (200 µm) in apicalcoronal direction. Results: The highest temperature value was detected at 500 mW and 360 mW. The average temperature increase recorded in our study at the external surface of the root canal did not exceed 10 ºC only at power setting of 220 mW during PAD with Zn-phtalocianine. Conclusion: In conclusion, photo-activated disinfection of the root canal with Zn-phtalocianine and 630 -nm diode laser using 200 μm fibreoptic tips at a power setting of 220 mW for 60 seconds induces a temperature increase which isn’t sufficient to damage the neighbouring tissues. Based on this results we don’t recommend root canal preparation over 02 or 04 <b>taper</b> when <b>PAD</b> will be performed...|$|R
40|$|Plans to {{shut down}} nuclear power plants in some European {{countries}} as well as increased electricity production by wind and solar power will increase the work load on hydroelectric power plants in the future. Also, due to the power grid regulations, hydroelectric power plants undergo more frequent start-ups and shut-downs. During such transient periods, a large amplitude shaft motion can occur, especially in the power plants with vertical shafts. Large shaft motion is not desirable because {{it can lead to}} a machine failure. Furthermore, performance limitations of conventional white metal or babbitted bearings call for the development of new bearing designs. An outstanding tribological performance can be achieved by introducing compliant polymer liners. At the same time, bearings with compliant liners may alter rotor-bearing system dynamic behaviour compared to the systems with conventional white metal bearings. The research approach of this thesis is to employ nonlinear analysis to provide further understanding of the compliant bearing dynamic response to synchronous shaft excitation. Plain cylindrical journal bearings with different compliant liner thicknesses were analysed using a nonlinear approach. The numerical model was verified with an in-house developed code at steady state conditions. Results obtained by the numerical models showed good agreement. After verification of the numerical model for fixed geometry journal bearings, models for tilting pad journal bearings were developed. Results for the tilting pad journal bearing with three pads with line pivot geometry were compared with published data in dynamic conditions. A good agreement was obtained between the two numerical models. The effect of pad pivot geometry on bearing dynamic response was investigated. Vertical and horizontal shaft configurations were compared in terms of the effect of preload factor, pivot offset, <b>tapers</b> and <b>pad</b> inclination angles. Influence of the viscoelastic properties of compliant liners was also studied. All these factors significantly affect bearing dynamic response. It is shown how these factors should be selected to control the journal orbit sizes. It was also shown that the compliant liner provides lower maximum oil film pressure and thicker minimum oil film thickness in the bearing mid-plane in both static and dynamic operating conditions.
