5|$|At {{the first}} {{performances}} of Parsifal {{problems with the}} moving scenery during the transition from scene 1 to scene 2 in act 1 meant that Wagner's existing orchestral interlude finished before Parsifal and Gurnemanz arrived at the Hall of the Grail. Engelbert Humperdinck, who was assisting the production, provided a few extra bars of music <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>this</b> gap. In subsequent years this problem was solved and Humperdinck's additions were not used.|$|E
5|$|Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) {{operates}} {{on a woman}} who flatlines, and despite his attempts to revive her, his father Christian Shephard (John Terry) forces him to stop and call the time of death. It is later revealed that it was actually Christian's operation; Jack was called in by a nurse after it becomes apparent {{that his father was}} performing the surgery under the influence of alcohol. Christian attempts <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>this</b> up by making Jack sign a form detailing the surgery, albeit with his inebriation omitted from the report, stating that the hospital will revoke his medical license if alcohol is mentioned.|$|E

5|$|John M. Harlan's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} {{towards the end}} of his career. His eyesight began to fail during the late 1960s. <b>To</b> <b>cover</b> <b>this,</b> he would bring materials to within an inch of his eyes, and have clerks and his wife read to him (once when the Court took an obscenity case, a chagrined Harlan had his wife read him Lady Chatterley's Lover). Gravely ill, he retired from the Supreme Court on September 23, 1971.|$|E
5|$|Section 4 of the Act {{includes}} new provisions <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>this</b> sort of situation. Section 4(1) {{establishes a}} general duty to repair {{and maintain the}} property, owed by the landlord to anyone who could reasonably {{be expected to be}} harmed by a breach; this includes tenants, their friends and family and also trespassers. This duty applies when a landlord ought to have known of a defect, not just when he has been informed of a defect. Additionally, a landlord who merely has the right to repair property rather than an obligation to do so may still be found liable, if one of the groups described in Section 4 was harmed by their failure to repair.|$|E
5|$|With even a {{few hundred}} missiles, the Soviets could afford to target every US bomber base. With no warning system in place, a sneak attack could destroy a {{significant}} amount of the US bomber fleet on the ground. The US would still have the airborne alert force and its own small ICBM fleet, but the USSR would have its entire bomber fleet and any missiles they did not launch, leaving them with a massive strategic advantage. To ensure this could not happen, the Report called for the installation of active defenses at SAC bases, Hercules in the short term and an ABM for the 1959 period, along with new early warning radars for ballistic missiles to allow alert aircraft to get away before the missiles hit. Even Zeus would come too late <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>this</b> period, and some consideration was given to an adapted Hercules or a land based version of the Navy's RIM-8 Talos as an interim ABM.|$|E

The routes reverted to their original form in 1927. During the 1930s, Southdown maintained a bus station in Portsmouth. In 1946 the company arranged an agreement with PCT to enable joint running on routes in Portsmouth.|$|E

25|$|In February 1940 General Condé {{decided to}} protect the exposed city of Longwy, forming the Position Avancée de Longwy (PAL), using a {{combination}} of hastily built blockhouses and field units. A series of anti-tank obstacles were built between Longwy and the border, defended by elements of the 58th and 51st Infantry Divisions. Artillery cover was provided by the 75mm gun turret of Ouvrage Fermont, which could cover all of the area except Longwy itself. Two 75mm gun casemates were built between Mexy and Haucourt <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>this</b> gap.|$|E

25|$|All {{of these}} sources tell of {{the siege of}} the city from the {{perspective}} of the besiegers. No accounts of the events as seen from inside the city have survived to modern times.

Translations of some of the few Arabic texts that refer indirectly to the loss of the city are all that is available <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>this</b> aspect of the history of the siege.|$|E
