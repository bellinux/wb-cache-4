Menhennet also began electronic publication in the same year, when the Library contributed to the Prestel <b>viewdata</b> <b>system.</b> Computerisation of the Library's information systems began in 1979 with the creation of POLIS, the Parliamentary On-Line Information System.|$|R
50|$|The custom {{nature of}} the {{technology}} hindered Compunet to a degree. The graphical design was very much keyed into the Commodore 64's graphical capabilities. Although this was {{more powerful than the}} <b>Viewdata</b> <b>systems</b> such as Prestel, it meant porting was difficult. However, software was later made available for the Amiga (1987) and Atari ST (1988). A PC version was developed in-house but never made publicly available.|$|R
40|$|The {{revolution}} in computer and electronic technology {{has given rise}} to equipment which can potentially provide primary producers with continuous access {{to a wide range of}} information stored on central computers. Modern communication systems mean these data are obtainable on the farm or property through standard telephone lines connected to the central computer. A number of these so called <b>viewdata</b> <b>systems</b> are already operating in several countries (Canada, England, France and the United States). Because adequate information is essential for efficient resource allocation it is important to assess the potential value of viewdata before a commitment is made to develop a system in New Zealand. The success of any system developed will depend to a large extent on the type of information maintained on the central computer and on the availability of information from other sources such as radio, television and printed material. Accordingly, the first step in developing a <b>viewdata</b> <b>system</b> must be to assess producers' existing sources of information and to determine whether existing sources of information are meeting the needs perceived by producers. This study was designed to address this question. One thousand producers were selected from geographical and production type strata and sent a postal questionnaire in November 1982. The questionnaire was designed to obtain data on a series of information related questions as well as to assess producers' views on the value of a <b>viewdata</b> <b>system.</b> Sixty three percent responded with valid replies. Data about the respondents' farms and personal attributes, sources of agricultural and horticultural information (radio, television, newspapers, journals, advisers, field days and other farms), uses of information (making decisions, providing agricultural news, providing agriculturally related entertainment), beliefs about the information (accuracy, detail, timeliness, ease of extraction) were obtained. General comments were also elicited. Finally, respondents were asked to estimate the value to them of various types of information (weather, market, financial, general farming, agricultural news and agricultural regulations) if it were made available through a <b>viewdata</b> <b>system.</b> The data obtained are presented in a series of tables and the important features discussed. Implications of the results to further viewdata related research are also stressed. The responses indicate that while a considerable amount of useful information is provided by existing sources, particularly farming journals, there are an appreciable number of areas where viewdata might augment existing information. While thirty six percent of the farmers answering the viewdata questions said they would not pay for the information provided, forty five percent were prepared to pay $ 151 per annum or more...|$|R
40|$|There is {{worldwide}} {{interest in}} the prospect for information access in the home using the television receiver for display of textual and graphical information. <b>Viewdata</b> <b>systems</b> use a large, central, computerized databank utility to store the information. Teletext systems transmit all the information over the air in a round-robin fashion, and users select the desired frame of information. These systems are examined {{in terms of the}} various communications applications that they may fulfil. Technological, marketing, and transmission implications are explored. ...|$|R

(Only one reference online.) It is believed that the work started in the late 1970s {{under the supervision of}} Peter Zorkcoczy, who also conceived the OPTEL <b>viewdata</b> <b>system.</b> Radiotext denoted the transmission of data over radio signals, just as it can be sent over telephone lines. It may seem normal now, as in the Radio Data System (RDS) in these days of digital radio, but in the 1970s the concept was novel and complex for their colleagues to grasp.|$|R
40|$|Surveys the {{possibilities}} of using electronic telecommunication with character strings in education within the next decade. Distant education and computer based learning (CBL) are considered as existing practice of text communication in education and as models for further developments. Particularly CBL teaching and learning strategies (i. e. drill and practice, programmed instruction, simulation, learner oriented information systems, interactive programming) are taken as example of existing and successfully used text communication. From the experience in CBL it is derived that the present <b>viewdata</b> <b>system</b> itself will not be appropriate as an interactive computer system for delivering education to the learner. However, {{it is possible to}} link dedicated computers to the planned German Bildschirmtext-network. Those will allow for most of the applications of CBL...|$|R
40|$|Interactive {{telecommunication}} services for household use [...] including shopping, booking and banking facilities [...] are made available through <b>viewdata</b> <b>systems,</b> which also {{provide access to}} virtually limitless amounts of information. The initial experiences in Britain of the public viewdata service (Prestel) in the domestic market were not encouraging, but recent changes in the product and in marketing strategy are proving more successful and providing useful pointers for the continuing development of these services. However, the problem of predicting their potential rate of adoption and usage is difficult, and complicated by the likelihood of further technical refinements which will substantially increase their capabilities. Fundamental studies of information-seeking and transactional behaviour may provide a productive avenue for further research, which will help in assessing the potential for domestic viewdata, and identifying those services and market segments where success may be easiest to achieve. ...|$|R
50|$|He {{became a}} clerk in the Commons Library in 1954. When given {{responsibility}} for the research area in 1964 he introduced a system of comprehensive daily briefings for MPs, and {{he was promoted to}} Deputy Librarian in 1967. When Speaker George Thomas appointed him 10th Librarian of the Commons Library in 1976, he began a process of modernisation. He set up the Public Information Office (now the House of Commons Information Office) in 1978, and electronic publication began the same year, when the Library contributed to the Prestel <b>viewdata</b> <b>system,</b> which at one time had 90,000 subscribers. Computerisation of the Library's information systems began in 1979 with the creation of the Parliamentary On-Line Information System (POLIS). He also established a service for schools. The new systems introduced by Menhennet enabled MPs to find and check information far more easily, and were used particularly often by Gordon Brown and Tony Blair while in opposition.|$|R
5000|$|The Open University {{begins a}} pilot {{trial of a}} <b>viewdata</b> (videotex) <b>system</b> OPTEL, on a DEC-20 mainframe. This had been {{conceived}} by Peter Zorkoczy even before {{the launch of the}} national Prestel system in 1979 and was locally specified and coded (in COBOL) by Peter Frogbrook (RIP) and Gyan Mathur. One of the main motivations was its applicability to online learning. It was available via dial-up from home, and later in the 1980s via telnet(!) on the X.25 and internet networks. There were individual user codes and passwords, giving different access rights; the one generic access code was regularly attacked by hackers even in these far-off days, as URLs still on the web attest. The system is overviewed in Delivery Mechanisms for CAL", CAL Research Group Technical Report No. 11.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Viewdata</b> <b>systems</b> in commercial use at present offer the facility for transmitting alphanumeric text and graphic displays via the public switched telephone network. An enhancement to the system would be to transmit true video images instead of graphics. Such a system, under development in Britain at present uses Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) and a transmission rate of 1200 bits/sec. Error protection is achieved {{by the use of}} error protection codes, which increases the channel requirement. In this thesis, error detection and correction of DPCM coded video signals without the use of channel error protection is studied. The scheme operates entirely at the receiver by examining the local statistics of the received data to determine the presence of errors. Error correction is then undertaken by interpolation from adjacent correct or previousiy corrected data. DPCM coding of pictures has the inherent disadvantage of a slow build-up of the displayed picture at the receiver and difficulties with image size manipulation. In order to fit the pictorial information into a viewdata page, its size has to be reduced. Unitary transforms, typically the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and the Hadamard transform (HT) enable lowpass filtering and decimation to be carried out in a single operation in the transform domain. Size reductions of different orders are considered and the merits of the DFT, DCT and HT are investigated. With limited channel capacity, it is desirable to remove the redundancy present in the source picture {{in order to reduce the}} bit rate. Orthogonal transformation decorrelates the spatial sample distribution and packs most of the image energy in the low order coefficients. This property is exploited in bit-reduction schemes which are adaptive to the local statistics of the different source pictures used. In some cases, bit rates of less than 1. 0 bit/pel are achieved with satisfactory received picture quality. Unlike DPCM systems, transform coding has the advantage of being able to display rapidly a picture of low resolution by initial inverse transformation of the low order coefficients only. Picture resolution is then progressively built up as more coefficients are received and decoded. Different sequences of picture update are investigated to find that which achieves the best subjective quality with the fewest possible coefficients transmitted...|$|R
5000|$|Over {{this period}} the Open University was also {{developing}} its own <b>viewdata</b> (videotex) <b>system,</b> called OPTEL, {{for use in}} education. This had in fact started {{about the same time}} as Cyclops in yet another team at the OU. The project ran until about 1985 when it faded away, as did videotex generally across the world (except the Minitel in France). In addition to OPTEL, several other systems were implemented including VOS (Videotex Operating System) which allowed the display and manipulation of text files via videotex. VOS was further developed into a telesoftware, transactional (gateway) and email system and then used in a commercial development for IMS, the media research company (using a very early precursor of Web/CGI development). These were coded in Pascal and COBOL on the DEC-20 mainframe. Some of the ideas of OPTEL were taken over into the ECCTIS project delivering course data via viewdata from a Unisys mainframe - indeed one of the former OPTEL staff joined ECCTIS as Director. Systems were also specified to deliver Computer-Assisted Learning - see in particular the article [...] "Viewdata systems" [...] in The Role of Technology in Distance Education. There are only fragmentary references now to OPTEL on the open Web.|$|R

40|$|In {{line with}} the {{selected}} methodology, the Innovation Management Task at IIASA is concentrating on sectors {{in an attempt to}} analyze the situation at this level of the economy before making any aggregations or conclusions relevant to management. In order to properly cover industry, it was suggested that branches that are at differing stages or that display different kinds of development be chosen for the study. Telecommunications was recommended as a branch with high growth. This was {{the first in a series}} of task force meetings initiated to promote an exchange of views among researchers and to coordinate the activities of individual collaborating institutions. A wide selection of issues for discussion are reviewed in the first paper (Vasko), which was circulated to participants in advance. It deals with macroeconomic aspects as well as with sectoral policy issues relevant to innovation. Prof. Braun's paper deals with basic questions of information related to macroeconomic variables. It particularly points out the volatility of value concepts as related to information and some of its consequences. The papers that follow deal with the organizational and economic environment of telecommunications. This environment, which was stable for decades, has been disturbed recently by new technology, which has brought with it new economies of scale, new demands, new organizational structures, new time horizons, etc. The paper by Dr. Mueller explores how this has changed the potential for competition in telecommunications. When asking for resources at a national level, proponents of telecommunications often have to show that the sector can provide social returns comparable to or even higher than those offered by other branches competing for the same resources. Here it is not easy to make a convincing case ex ante, which becomes a difficulty especially when we have new services in mind. Similar difficulties are experienced by individual services within the telecommunications branch or even by individual users, as is shown in the paper by Dr. Puzman. No generally accepted methodology is in sight-case studies and their conclusions seem to be the only substitute. A similar problem is described and suggested for further research by John Page. He concentrates on the interaction of telecommunications and computer-based information technology. Many managerial and policy issues are generated by this interaction and by organizational and operational dissimilarities of these two branches. The last four papers deal with the relation of telecommunications development to other branches and activities. Dr. Seetzen points out how different technological innovations can be "complementary" to each other in delivering a system capable of new services and/or in offering a new value to the user. Some potential applications (in information transfer) of these innovations are explored in the second paper by Mr. Page. He shows also how present tariff policies can hamper the acceptance of new services (for example electronic document delivery). The relations of telecommunications to the printing industry and its potential future development are explored in the paper by Prof. Karttunen. He shows how the progress of information technology in general and telecommunications in particular can influence the graphic arts industry and its progress, giving particular attention to the scene in Finland. An interesting attempt is made in the paper by Dr. Granstrand. He compares the innovation environment in two production branches in Sweden in which two innovated products have emerged recently [...] the automobile and telecommunication equipment branches. This comparison serves as a vehicle for identifying similarities and differences in the process of innovation mangement with emphasis on capital formation. The last paper in the proceedings describes the result of research in videotex systems carried out at IIASA by Drs. Maurer and Sebestyen. The paper presents a technical and economic analysis of the present state of the art and the potential future development of videotex systems with special attention to a comparison of one-way and two-way videotex systems. The authors also try to identify the role of technical innovation of individual components in the system's development with due attention to human and societal factors. The paper presented by Mr. Nemeth on the use of <b>viewdata</b> <b>systems</b> for inventory control is not included in the proceedings but will be published as a collaborative paper by the institute at a later date...|$|R
