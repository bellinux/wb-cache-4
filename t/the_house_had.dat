5|$|By {{the time}} the fire was under control, the house was almost totally destroyed, leaving behind only the garage and some front stonework. The fire had spread rapidly, and {{although}} high winds contributed to the intensity, authorities deemed {{the speed with which}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> become fully involved suspicious enough to bring in arson investigators. The bodies of Tim and Kelly were not recovered until the following morning, when <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> cooled enough to permit safe searching. Kelly had perished in her bed, most likely of smoke inhalation. Tim's body was found on the ground floor, near the kitchen. Investigators at first assumed he had died trying to escape, but later determined that he had perished in or near his bedroom, most likely of smoke inhalation and heat, and that his body had fallen through burned flooring to where it was discovered.|$|E
5|$|Henry Strachey, the {{grandson}} of the geologist and a senior civil servant, was created a baronet in 1801. When he inherited {{the house in the}} 18th century <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> been mortgaged, however the mortgage was paid by Strachey's employer Clive of India.|$|E
5|$|Jane Howard {{found that}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> {{previously}} been called Lemmons, {{and decided to}} restore that name. It was known as Gladsmuir when they bought it—from Gladsmuir Heath, the former name of Hadley Common, site of the Battle of Barnet in 1471 during the Wars of the Roses. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> been registered under that name as a Grade II listed building in 1949, previously known as Gladsmuir House, with an address in Hadley Wood Road. As of 2014 the address was listed as Hadley Common.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Dutch {{design of}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> been retained. Floor plans of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>have</b> been published. These include a probable plan for <b>the</b> original <b>house</b> built by Van Arrsens and/or Hyrne and <b>the</b> current <b>house.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> a timber {{balustrade}} and a timber [...] "skirt" [...] {{down to the}} foundation. There are panelled {{doors at}} the front of Selhurst. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> a central hall with rooms opening to either side and a small ballroom at the rear of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> which <b>has</b> been converted to a family room.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> {{a portal}} doorway {{which was built}} onto <b>the</b> <b>house</b> in 1590. <b>The</b> owner, Lorenc Stork, hired Bonifaz Wohlmut to design it.

5|$|Stern House, {{a private}} home in which Zionist leader Theodor Herzl had lodged {{overnight}} during his 1898 visit to Jerusalem. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> become a Zionist shrine, with the room in which Herzl slept given over to photos and memorabilia from Herzl's life. Though <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> been heavily damaged in the 1948 war, preservationists won a suit in the Israel Supreme Court to save it from demolition. The two-story masonry-block house, originally located at 18 Mamilla Street, was dismantled brick by brick and warehoused for ten years until builders were ready to reassemble it on Alrov Mamilla Avenue. Safdie left the colored numbers on the brick facades of this and other preserved houses to emphasize the preservation nature of the work. The Stern House presently houses a restaurant, bar, and Steimatzky bookstore.|$|E
5|$|Between 1820 and 1828 {{the earl}} had {{converted}} the abandoned tennis {{court and the}} Castle Inn – which he closed in 1812 after buying the castle – into a new, grand building, called Castle House, overlooking {{the north side of}} the outer bailey. By the 1840s <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> been leased out, first to George Hodges and his family, and then to William Urwick and to Robert Marston, all important members of the local landowning classes. The mansion included a drawing room, dining room, study, servants' quarters, a conservatory and grapevines, and in 1887 was worth £50 a year in rent.|$|E
5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury, {{in stark contrast to}} the jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here. The signpost at the spot shows a photograph of a trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. Today, the house is a ruin, burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> pine floors throughout, {{nailed to}} joists on doubled bearers and {{supported}} on adzed round hardwood stumps; cover strips conceal the central cut along the passageway that {{is evidence of}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>having</b> been moved onto the site.|$|R

5|$|Harry became {{interested}} in science fiction and read comics by candlelight (as <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> no electricity), eventually joining the Liverpool Science Fiction Society. At the age of 13, he produced his own science fiction fanzine, Biped, using a Gestetner machine to print 60 copies. His pen friend {{at the time was}} Michael Moorcock; the writer of science fiction and fantasy novels. After winning a scholarship to the Junior School of Art in Gambier Terrace, Liverpool, Harry started his first school newspaper, Premier.|$|E
5|$|In 1901 Gaudí {{decorated}} {{the house of}} Isabel Güell López, Marchioness of Castelldosrius, and daughter of Eusebi Güell. Situated at 19 Carrer Junta de Comerç, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> been built in 1885 and renovated between 1901 and 1904; it was destroyed by a bomb during the Civil War. The following year Gaudí {{took part in the}} decoration of the Bar Torino, property of Flaminio Mezzalana, located at 18 Passeig de Gràcia; Gaudí designed the ornamentation of el Salón Árabe of that establishment, made with varnished Arabian-style cardboard tiles (which no longer exist).|$|E
5|$|The couple {{bought the}} Georgian five-bay villa (built around 1830) for £48,000 at auction in 1968, {{along with its}} eight acres of land, and lived there until 1976. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> been {{registered}} as a Grade II listed building in 1949 under the name Gladsmuir, previously known as Gladsmuir House. Jane Howard restored an earlier name, Lemmons; the next owners changed it back to Gladsmuir.|$|E

5|$|The {{northern}} {{winter of}} 1962–1963 {{was one of}} the coldest in 100 years; the pipes froze, the children—now two years old and nine months—were often sick, and <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> no telephone. Her depression returned but she completed the rest of her poetry collection which would be published after her death (1965 in the UK, 1966 in the US). Her only novel, The Bell Jar, was released in January 1963, published under the pen name Victoria Lucas, and was met with critical indifference.|$|E
5|$|After {{scouting}} Vancouver for a {{place to}} film scenes that involved the Swan house, {{the decision was made to}} recreate the house on an empty lot with a tree line and approaching road. The production team was able to rearrange the exterior of the house to match that in the first movie. When faced with creating the interior, the team measured the house in Portland, and built various pieces of the house on the lot and on a stage in Vancouver. The second film also attempted to clarify the location of Bella's room, which, as seen in the first film, seemed to be located in the front of the house, when in reality it was on the right-hand side. Complications arose when the Portland house was repainted after Twilights release, which took away the aging <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> come to depict in the film. When recreating the house, the production team referenced the first film on high-definition Blu-ray Disc.|$|E
5|$|Designed by William R. Walker & Son and {{constructed}} by S. Mason & H. A. Smith in 1886, the one story red brick Queen Anne style building is basically rectangular with a low-pitched hipped roof. The red bricks are laid in dark red mortar and is contrasted by the granite sill course and brownstone belt course at window sill level. The building has a central closed entry pavilion which projects out {{and has two}} porches oriented to face Mulberry and Cedar Street. The building has three lunette windows {{on the sides of}} the main block, each divided into thirds, and a smaller windows on the pavilion's pedimented end. The rear ell has double hung two-over-two sash windows. At the time of the nomination, during the renovations to a single family home, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> its Cedar Street porch closed in with plywood and the smaller lunette windows were boarded in, but the exterior wooden trim was largely extant.|$|E
50|$|The {{site is a}} 40 acre parcel near a small creek about 15 ft below <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Springs near <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>have</b> been dammed by a wall {{aligned with}} the piano bay's angled wall, forming a small pond. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> been {{modified}} and somewhat enlarged, with consultation from Taliesin.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> a large central chimney, and a triple-run {{staircase}} which circumscribes {{the oven}} and chimney. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> five fireplaces, five windows in each room, and five trees planted in front of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> to break westerly winds. The farm’s large barn is close to <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and situated to break northeasterly winds.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> a {{hip roof}} that {{was covered with}} terra cotta tiles in the 1920s. There are two dormers {{on each of the}} sides and three dormers in <b>the</b> rear. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> two {{interior}} chimneys with corbelled caps. [...] The interior has a four-room plan with central hallway. The ceilings and walls are plastered. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> its original floors. Most major rooms are decorated in Adamsesque style with cornices, ceiling medallions, and carved mantels. The first and second story rooms on the northwest were decorated in Regency style when <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was enlarged. <b>The</b> first floor room toward the northeast was badly damaged in a fire during the 20th century. The room was rebuilt as a kitchen and library. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> a spiral staircase with circular skylight. Additional pictures are available.|$|R
5|$|Morrissey {{was born}} in the Kensington area of Liverpool, the son of Joe, a cobbler, and Joan, who worked for Littlewoods. He was their fourth child, {{following}} brothers Tony and Paul, and sister Karen Lane. The family lived at 45 Seldon Street, in the Kensington district of Liverpool. For National Museums Liverpool's Eight Hundred Lives project, Morrissey wrote that <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> been in his family since {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. His grandmother had been married there and his mother was born there. In 1971, the family moved to a larger, modern house on the new estates at Knotty Ash, and Seldon Street was later demolished.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May, Van der Sloot {{allegedly}} {{accepted the}} amount of $15,000 by wire transfer to his account in the Netherlands, following a cash payment of $10,000 that was videotaped by undercover investigators in Aruba. In exchange, Van der Sloot told Kelly that his father buried Holloway's remains in {{the foundation of a}} house. Authorities determined that this information was false, because <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> not yet been built at the time of Holloway's disappearance. Van der Sloot later e-mailed Kelly that he lied about the house. Holloway was shocked that the FBI did not promptly file extortion charges against Van der Sloot, allowing him to leave freely with the money to Bogotá, Colombia, on his way to Lima, Peru. The FBI and the office of the U.S. Attorney contended that the case had not yet been sufficiently developed.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, {{the last}} day of the {{legislative}} session, the Senate bill was revived in the Hawaii House following a motion by Majority Leader Blake Oshiro. Speaker Calvin Say immediately ordered a recess and after the representatives returned four votes to suspend legislative rules postponing the issue were taken and the bill passed with 31 to 20 votes. Governor Linda Lingle had until July 6 to decide whether to sign or veto the measure. The House vote margin in support is not large enough to override a gubernatorial veto. Lingle vetoed the bill on July 6, arguing civil unions should be decided by referendum. <b>The</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> ruled out any attempt to override her vetoes for the legislative session.|$|E
50|$|The St. Croix Boom Company House and Barn {{is located}} {{directly}} across Minnesota State Highway 95 from the St. Croix Boom Site, 2 mi {{north of the}} city of Stillwater. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> two stories while the barn has one and a half. Both are sided with clapboard and sport decorative spindlework on their gables. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> a one-story wraparound porch. Originally built on a simple rectangular plan, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> been modified with additions to the south and west, plus a dormer on the west.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Frazier-Pressley <b>House</b> is a three-story, stuccoed brick building. It is {{believed}} that it was built for Captain James W. Frazier in 1852 to 1856. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> three octagonal elements joined with a connecting hallway. There is a two story, brick extension to the rear. The facade has four three-story brick columns. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> five brick chimneys. It originally had a widow's walk {{on the top of the}} central octagon. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>has</b> eleven major rooms. Each of the floors of each octagon is a single room.

5|$|Pierce {{departed}} in November 1833 for Washington, D.C., {{where the}} Twenty-third United States Congress convened its regular session on December 2. Jackson's second term was under way, and <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>had</b> a strong Democratic majority, whose primary focus was {{to prevent the}} Second Bank of the United States from being rechartered. The Democrats, including Pierce, defeated proposals supported by the newly formed Whig Party, and the bank's charter expired. Pierce broke from his party on occasion, opposing Democratic bills to fund internal improvements with federal money. He saw both the bank and infrastructure spending as unconstitutional, with internal improvements {{the responsibility of the}} states. Pierce's first term was fairly uneventful from a legislative standpoint, and he was easily re-elected in March 1835. When not in Washington, he attended to his law practice, and in December 1835 returned to the capital for the Twenty-fourth Congress.|$|E
5|$|The Mostyns' {{principal}} residence was Mostyn Hall in Flintshire and so {{the family}} rented out Plas Mawr to various tenants during the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 18th century the gatehouse {{was used as a}} courthouse and the main house as cheap housing. In the 19th century, parts of the house were converted into a school and space for other small businesses, as well as still being used for domestic accommodation: in 1881, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> 25 residents. Minor changes were made to Plas Mawr in the process, such as the installation of partition walls to subdivide the larger rooms, but it remained largely intact. The Mostyns offered the house for sale in 1870, as part of a package of land including Bodysgallen Hall, but there were no offers.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} built for Sir Edmund Wright, who became Lord Mayor of London in 1640. The brick {{structure}} dates from between 1629 and 1638. In 1629, Wright purchased the grounds from John Bingley, who had undertaken extensive remedial work on an existing 13th century structure in the grounds—probably timber-framed and wattle filled. Bingley's alterations {{were said to have}} been detrimental to the condition of the house and grounds. He was accused of driving away almost all the birds in the dovehouse, and of pulling up many healthy fruit-bearing trees from the orchard. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>had</b> a moat, which Bingley filled in, believing the water to be unhealthy, at which point he also had a defensive brick wall built around the house.|$|E
