40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to gather more {{information}} about the process of internationalization in U. S. counseling psychology programs. Participants included 26 <b>training</b> <b>directors</b> and 83 doctoral students, representing 32 of the 63 APA-accredited, active counseling psychology doctoral programs. Results suggested that the presence of international learning opportunities did not increase from 2007 to 2010, with the exception that internationalism was increasingly being incorporated into the definition of multiculturalism. Results also suggested that <b>training</b> <b>directors</b> perceived opportunities to gain international experience in their programs integrated to a greater extent compared to their doctoral students. Doctoral students, however, perceived greater institutional commitment to international learning opportunities compared to their <b>training</b> <b>directors.</b> Finally, results suggested that both sets of respondents’ attitudes were generally favorable toward internationalization. Implications for counseling psychology training programs, as well as recommendations for improving internationalization efforts are discussed.

2500|$|Some law {{enforcement}} experts have also stated that, while they appreciate the site's mission, {{they do not}} agree with some of the operators' and volunteers' practices. In a December 2004 article in the New York Sun, Bradley Russ, the <b>training</b> <b>director</b> for the federal Internet Crimes Against Children Taskforce (which has trained about 200 {{law enforcement}} agents nationwide) said that the tactics of Perverted-Justice sometimes run counter to the task force's standards. For instance, Russ said, by accepting child pornography from their [...] "busts" [...] to bolster a potential legal case, the volunteers are themselves in possession of unlawful images. He said federal authorities have begun considering whether to seize Perverted-Justice contributors' computers. [...] "It's a noble effort gone too far," [...] Russ told the newspaper. He also said the site's tactics can {{make it more difficult for}} law enforcement to prosecute cases they present because those cases can be considered tainted by entrapment claims. According to Russ, [...] "I have a real problem with any citizens' group conducting any investigation into any crime ... It's a mistake for law enforcement to abdicate its responsibility to citizens." [...] Said Russ, [...] "I think it's a huge mistake when law enforcement partners with citizens to do investigations. ... I'm very concerned about entrapment issues." [...] Tom Nolan, a Boston University professor and former Boston police officer, echoes Russ's criticism, [...] "I have an issue with private citizens engaging in these kinds of investigatory practices. ... Perverted Justice, even though they are in fact acting as agents of law enforcement, are not abiding by the policies. ... This is vigilantism. It's sensational vigilantism." ...|$|E
50|$|There {{had been}} {{at least one major}} {{accident}} with the PZB90 in place - on 26 June 2000 an S-Bahn train left Hannover-Langenhagen station for a single-track section with an oncoming train. The PZB halted the train but the driver released the train ("Freitaste") without double-checking with the <b>train</b> <b>director.</b> The investigative report notes that there had been 22 similar recorded occurrences until that time when a driver related the PZB halt to a different cause than having overrun a main signal - the report concludes that the operations manual should be changed in that double-checking with <b>train</b> <b>director</b> should not only be required on a main signal overrun but explicitly on all PZB-related stops.|$|R
40|$|We sent a {{behavioral}} neurology fellowship questionnaire {{to each of}} the <b>training</b> <b>directors</b> of 160 neurology residency programs throughout the world, seeking information about programs offering advanced training in behavioral neurology (or similar fellowships in cognitive neurology, neurobehavior, or cognitive neuroscience). Response rate was 100 %. Thirty-four respondents reported active fellowship programs in behavioral neurology, and 28 additional respondents indicated that {{a behavioral}} neurology fellowship was planned. Nine of the 34 programs (26. 5 %) defined themselves as exclusively or predominantly concerned with dementia and age-related neurobehavioral disorders. Directors of the 34 active fellowship programs estimated that their combined programs had graduated 199 fellows and were currently training fifty. Most fellowships concentrated on outpatient clinical training, with teaching required by 78. 1 % and research required by 81. 8 %. Specialty certification for behavioral neurology was favored by over 75 % of behavioral neurology fellowship <b>training</b> <b>directors</b> but by only 30 % of <b>training</b> <b>directors</b> in residency programs without behavioral neurology fellowships.

40|$|ADMINISTRATIVE PREPARATION OF UNDERGRADUATE ATHLETIC TRAINING PROGRAM DIRECTORSBridgett Mary Passauer, EdDUniversity of Pittsburgh, 2004 Throughout higher education, {{faculty members}} have assumed {{the roles and}} {{responsibilities}} of academic administrators. The field of athletic training is no different. Certified athletic trainers assume the roles and responsibilities of academic administrators when they are named program directors. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if undergraduate athletic <b>training</b> program <b>directors</b> perceived themselves as prepared for the roles and responsibilities of academic administration. The undergraduate athletic <b>training</b> program <b>directors</b> were also asked for suggestions on how best to prepare future athletic <b>training</b> program <b>directors.</b> Eighty-nine undergraduate athletic <b>training</b> program <b>directors</b> responded to an electronically distributed survey which revealed that, overall, undergraduate athletic <b>training</b> program <b>directors</b> do not feel prepared for the roles and responsibilities associated with academic administration. One of the interesting results was found when analyzing the difference between types of candidates selected for the position of undergraduate athletic <b>training</b> program <b>director.</b> Internal candidates had higher mean scores for all roles and responsibilities however; only one of the mean scores was above a 3. 00. The overall population of respondents rated the role of leader and mentor as the role they felt most prepared for with the role of faculty developer being the role they felt least prepared for. When asked to recommend the level of education that a program specifically geared toward educating future athletic <b>training</b> program <b>directors,</b> a minimum of a Master's degree was recommended by all respondents. This research further supports previous research, which sites the need for more comprehensive preparation of academic administrators, ideally prior to, but minimally, once appointed to the position of academic administrator...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2016 American Society of Clinical Oncology. All rights reserved. Purpose. To {{assist in}} {{determining}} barriers to an oncology career incorporating cancer prevention, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Cancer Prevention Workforce Pipeline Work Group sponsored surveys of <b>training</b> program <b>directors</b> and oncology fellows. Methods. Separate surveys with parallel questions {{were administered to}} training program dir ectors at their fall 2013 retreat and to oncology fellows {{as part of their}} February 2014 in-training examination survey. Forty-seven (67 %) of 70 <b>training</b> <b>directors</b> and 1, 306 (80 %) of 1, 634 oncology fellows taking the in-training examination survey answered questions. Results. <b>Training</b> <b>directors</b> estimated that ≤ 10 % of fellows starting an academic career or entering private practice would have a career focus in cancer prevention. Only 15 % of fellows indicated they would likely be interested in cancer prevention as a career focus, although only 12 % thought prevention was unimportant relative to treatment. Top fellow-listed barriers to an academic career were difficulty in obtaining funding and lower compensation. Additional barriers to an academic career with a prevention focus included unclear career model, lack of clinical mentors, lack of clinical training opportunities, and concerns about reimbursement. Conclusion. Reluctance to incorporate cancer prevention into an oncology career seems to stem from lack of mentors and exposure during training, unclear career path, and uncertainty regarding reimbursement. Suggested approaches to begin to remedy this problem include: 1) more ASCO-led and other prevention educational resources for fellows, <b>training</b> <b>directors,</b> and practicing oncologists; 2) an increase in funded training and clinical research opportunities, including reintroduction of the R 25 T award; 3) an increase in the prevention content of accrediting examinations for clinical oncologists; and 4) interaction with policymakers to broaden the scope and depth of reimbursement for prevention counseling and intervention services...|$|R
