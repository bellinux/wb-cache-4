At 01:32, the Reinforcement Group left Guadalcanal in its wake and reached Bougainville without incident at 10:00, completing the operation.|$|E
5|$|Yumemi is very {{adamant about}} {{protecting}} humans and is happiest {{when she is}} helping those she serves. When she is unable to help someone, she gets terribly worried that she is incapable of offering assistance and must instead indirectly help a customer by directing {{him or her to}} someone who can. Protecting humans is her top priority and will even ignore previous orders <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>no</b> human is harmed when in her care.|$|E
5|$|The Iraqi Army, led by Bakr Sidqi, an {{experienced}} brigadier general, an Iraqi nationalist and general of Kurdish origin, {{although not a}} Kurdish nationalist, moved north in order to crush the Assyrian revolt. The Iraqi forces started executing every Assyrian male found in the mountainous Bekher region between Zakho and Duhok starting from 8 August 1933. Assyrian civilians were transported in military trucks from Zakho and Dohuk to uninhabited places, in batches of eight or ten, where they were shot with machine guns and run over by heavy armoured cars <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>no</b> one survived.|$|E

5|$|Abel Starkey was {{a native}} of Roxbury, Massachusetts. The story of Starkey's capture was {{published}} by George Hubbard in The New England Magazine. Starkey was part of a gang of counterfeiters, including Stephen Burroughs, Samuel Corson and James Smith. Pursued by the authorities, Abel Starkey disappeared in the vicinity of a lightning splitter home that was owned by the Shephardson family. A thorough search of the house was conducted and the authorities found nothing. According to Hubbard, the house was the refuge of the counterfeiters for a number of years. After a time the public and authorities continued to track members of the gang to the location and investigations were performed only to turn up empty. Sheriff Johnson of Worcester tracked the counterfeiters to the house one day and set up a team of men outside and inside the house to uncover and arrest the counterfeiters. A careful search turned up nothing, so measurements of the house were taken <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>no</b> secret rooms or areas existed. With the inaccessible third attic all but ruled out, the discovery of its access through the chimney was by chance when an officer emptied out his trash into the fireplace. Contained in the trash was some snuff and a sneeze came from above, alerting the officers of hidden occupants in the chimney. After the fire had been extinguished and raked out, Sheriff Johnson attempted to climb up into the chimney. A brick was dropped from above and wounded him. The authorities capped the chimney and smoked the counterfeiters until they fell unconscious. Starkey was amongst the three arrested counterfeiters.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and early 1940s, Edsel—who was {{president}} of the company—thought Ford had to come to some sort of collective bargaining agreement with the unions because the violence, work disruptions, and bitter stalemates could not go on forever. But Ford, who still had the final veto in the company on a de facto basis even if not an official one, refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir makes clear that Ford's purpose in putting Bennett in charge was <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>no</b> agreements were ever reached.|$|E

500|$|When Wei begins teaching, she {{has little}} {{rapport with the}} students: they shout and run around instead of copying their work, and the class troublemaker, Zhang Huike, insists that [...] "she's not a teacher, she's Wei Chunzhi's big sister!" [...] After putting the lesson on the board, Wei usually sits outside, {{guarding}} the door <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>no</b> students leave until they have finished their work. Early in the month, a sports recruiter comes to take one athletic girl, Ming Xinhong, to a special training school; unwilling to let any students leave, Wei hides Ming, and when the village mayor (Tian Zhenda) finds her, Wei chases after their car in a futile attempt to stop them.|$|E
500|$|The {{first day}} of filming for the episode was August 9, 2011, though some cast members were called the day before to begin {{recording}} musical numbers. Murphy realized that The Glee Project runner-up Lindsay Pearce would be ideal for an already-written role in the episode, but the filming needed to take place before the project's finale was broadcast on August 21, 2011, upon which it would be revealed that she had won a two-episode prize. They [...] "kept delaying" [...] the shoot, and [...] "snuck [...] into a soundstage <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>no</b> one recognized her." [...] In aid of this secrecy, her name was omitted from the Fox press release for the episode. Once Murphy had cast Pearce, he made the musical number she was to appear in bigger. According to Lea Michele, the filming of the first episode ended on August 19, 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Houston {{signed with}} Arista in 1983, {{but did not}} begin work on her album immediately. The label wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>no</b> other label signed the singer away.

2500|$|Minos {{justified}} his accession as {{king and}} prayed to Poseidon for a sign. Poseidon sent a giant white bull {{out of the}} sea. Minos was committed to sacrificing the bull to Poseidon, but then decided to substitute a different bull. In rage, Poseidon cursed Pasiphaë, Minos' wife, with zoophilia. Daedalus built her a wooden cow, which she hid inside. The bull mated with the wooden cow and Pasiphaë was impregnated by the bull, giving birth to a horrible monster, again named Asterius, the Minotaur, half man half bull. Daedalus then built a complicated [...] "chamber that with its tangled windings perplexed the outward way" [...] called the Labyrinth, and Minos put the Minotaur in it. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>no</b> one would ever know the secret of who the Minotaur was {{and how to get}} out of the Labyrinth (Daedalus knew both of these things), Minos imprisoned Daedalus and his son, Icarus, along with the monster. Daedalus and Icarus flew away on wings Daedalus invented, but Icarus' wings melted because he flew too close to the sun. Icarus fell in the sea and drowned.|$|E

60|$|First {{peering out}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>no</b> {{soldiers}} were attempting the passage, Koolau started {{back on the}} run for the caves. All the time the shells were moaning, whining, screaming by, and the valley was rumbling and reverberating with the explosions. As he came in sight of the caves, he saw the two idiots cavorting about, clutching each other's hands with their stumps of fingers. Even as he ran, Koolau saw a spout of black smoke rise from the ground, near to the idiots. They were flung apart bodily by the explosion. One lay motionless, but the other was dragging himself by his hands toward the cave. His legs trailed out helplessly behind him, while the blood was pouring from his body. He seemed bathed in blood, and as he crawled he cried like a little dog. The rest of the lepers, {{with the exception of}} Kapahei, had fled into the caves.|$|E

6000|$|... "You may easily {{conceive}} {{my surprise}} at this scene. Immediately the {{recollection of the}} attack by the Indians on the Esquimau camp, and of Maximus's young bride having been carried off, flashed upon me, and I {{had no doubt that}} the Esquimau girl now stood before me. Indeed, the fact of the broken exclamations uttered by the pair being in the Esquimau tongue put this beyond a doubt. A feeling of great delight filled my heart as I looked upon the couple thus unexpectedly reunited; while they, quite oblivious of my presence, poured out a flood of question and reply, in the midst of which they ever and anon embraced, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>no</b> doubt, of their physical identity. Then it suddenly occurred to me that I was behaving very ill, so I wheeled about and sauntered away to a little distance {{in the direction of the}} shore, in order to take some astronomical observations of the sky, and gaze inquiringly up at the moon, which at that moment broke through a bank of clouds, tipping the icebergs on the sea and the branches of the overhanging trees with silver light.|$|E
