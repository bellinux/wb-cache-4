Different levels of contamination and types of contaminants were considered in this work, including chemical priority substances (PSs) and contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), as well as potential human opportunistic antibiotic resistant bacteria and their genes (ARB&ARG). Photocatalytic ozonation was more effective than single ozonation (or even than TiO 2 catalytic ozonation) in the degradation of typical reaction by-products (such as oxalic acid), and more effective than photocatalysis to remove the parent micropollutants determined in urban wastewater. In fact, only fluoxetine, clarithromycin, erythromycin and 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE 2) were detected after photocatalytic ozonation, by using solid-phase extraction (SPE) pre-concentration and LC-MS/MS analysis. In surface water, this treatment allowed the removal of all determined micropollutants to levels below the limit of detection (0. 01 - 0. 20  ng L(- 1)). The efficiency of this process was then assessed based on the capacity to remove different groups of cultivable microorganisms and housekeeping (16 S rRNA) and antibiotic resistance or related genes (intI 1, blaTEM, qnrS, sul 1). Photocatalytic ozonation was observed to efficiently remove microorganisms and ARGs. Although after storage total heterotrophic and ARB (to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, meropenem), fungi, and the genes 16 S rRNA and intI 1, increased to values close to the pre-treatment levels, the ARGs (blaTEM, qnrS and sul 1) were reduced to levels below/close to the quantification limit even after 3 -days storage of treated surface water or wastewater. Yeast estrogen screen (YES), <b>thiazolyl</b> <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium</b> reduction (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were also performed before and after photocatalytic ozonation to evaluate the potential estrogenic activity, the cellular metabolic activity and the cell viability.

40|$|The burgeoning {{field of}} {{bioremediation}} {{relies on the}} natural abilities of plants and fungi to accumulate certain toxic heavy metals. In heavy metal detoxification, plant and yeast vacuoles {{are responsible for the}} sequestration of toxins away from the cytoplasm. A yet-unpublished study done by the Rea group analyzed the protein profile of the vacuolar lumen in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases were found within this compartment, a surprising finding in light of the yeast vacuole 2 ̆ 7 s predominantly lytic function. Five of these enzymes were found to increase in level in the vacuole during heavy metal stress. Moreover, when vacuolar lysates were assayed in vitro, they were found to contain dehydrogenase activity when exogenous NAD+ or NADH was provided. If these enzymes are also active in this compartment in vivo, the question is raised: from where do the cofactors required for the reactions that these enzymes catalyze come? If these enzymes had a vacuolar source of NAD+, they could also potentially be active in vivo. Thus, in the present project, we are seeking to determine the concentration of NAD+ inside the vacuole of S. cerevisiae. Toward this end, high-purity 2 ̆ 2 proteomics-grade 2 ̆ 2 intact vacuoles were isolated from S. cerevisiae by a combination of differential, density, and floatation centrifugation. NAD+ was then extracted by acid precipitation and solvent extraction to separate vacuolar proteins from cofactor. NAD+ was quantified using a two-step redox-coupled reaction system containing phenazine methosulfate (PMS) as mediator and thiazoyl <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium</b> <b>bromide</b> (MTT) as terminal electron acceptor. The spectrophotometric measurement of reduced MTT at 570 nm is an indirect measure of the initial NAD+ concentration. To provide a basis for comparison, the estimated NAD+ content of isolated vacuoles was compared to that of spheroplasts lysates extracted and assayed identically. The results indicate that the intravacuolar concentration of NAD+ is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the spheroplast (5. 2 vs. 202 μM), which may have implications for this redox-active cofactor’s function in the vacuole. These findings may necessitate the reconsideration of the role played by vacuolar dehydrogenases in yeast cell metabolism (and possibly the metabolism of other vacuolate cells). Our findings suggest that the vacuolar pool of NAD+ may be sufficient for utilization in the vacuole...|$|R

To provide clear evidence for the clinical use of PRF, we investigated the biologic effects of PRF on human gingival fibroblasts (GFs), periodontal ligament (PDL) cells, oral epithelial cells, and osteoblasts. Materials and methods: Blood collection was carried out on 10 healthy volunteers. PRF was obtained by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 12 minutes with a PC- 02 table centrifuge.

40|$|Abstractl-Cysteine (Cys) capped CdTe {{quantum dots}} (CdTe@Cys QDs) were {{successfully}} synthesized {{in an aqueous}} medium. The synthesized CdTe@Cys samples were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, fluorescence (FL) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), confocal microscopy and subsequently subjected to the antibacterial test. Systematic investigations were carried out for the determination of optimal conditions namely the ratios of Cd:Te, CdTe:Cys, pH value and the chemical stability of CdTe@Cys. Moreover, the reactivation of FL intensity in the CdTe@Cys sample was done easily by the addendum of Cys. The introduction of additional cysteine to the CdTe@Cys QDs sample showed an enhancement {{in terms of the}} FL intensity and stability along with the reduced antibacterial activity. This was further confirmed through <b>Thiazolyl</b> <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium</b> <b>bromide</b> (MTT) assays. Both the result of the bio-stability tests namely the antibacterial test and MTT assay displayed similarities between the externally added Cys and cytotoxicity of the bacteria and human HeLa cancer cell lines. Confocal microscopic images were captured for the CdTe@Cys conjugated Escherichia coli...|$|E
40|$|Polydatin (PD), a {{component}} isolated from Polygonum cuspidatum, {{has a number}} of biological functions. However, the antitumor activity of PD has been poorly investigated. In this study, the effect of PD on cell proliferation was evaluated by <b>thiazolyl</b> <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium</b> <b>bromide</b> assay. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were investigated by flow cytometry. The phosphorylation levels of panel of phosphor-kinases were detected by human phospho-kinase arrays. The expression of several proteins associated with cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by Western blot analysis. Results showed that PD effectively inhibited the growth of MDA-MB- 231 and MCF- 7 breast cancer cell lines. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that PD induced S-phase cell cycle arrest. Human phosphor-kinase arrays showed that the phosphorylation level of cAMP response element-bingding proteins(Creb) was down-regulated, and the results were further confirmed by Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of protein of cyclin D 1 decreased in a time- and dose- dependent manner. Results suggest that PD is a potential therapeutic natural compound...|$|E
40|$|Arsenic {{trioxide}} (ATO) is {{an efficient}} drug {{for the treatment}} of the patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Inhibition of proliferation as well as apoptosis, attenuation of migration, and induction of differentiation in tumor cells are the main mechanisms through which ATO acts against APL. Despite advantages of ATO in treatment of some malignancies, certain harmful side effects, such as cardiotoxicity, have been reported. It has been well documented that morphine has antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and cytoprotective properties and is able to attenuate cytotoxicity. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of morphine against ATO toxicity in H 9 c 2 myocytes using multi-parametric assay including <b>thiazolyl</b> <b>blue</b> <b>tetrazolium</b> <b>bromide</b> (MTT) assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, caspase 3 activity, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) phosphorylation assay, and expression of apoptotic markers. Our results showed that morphine (1 μM) attenuated cytotoxicity induced by ATO in H 9 c 2 cells. Results {{of this study suggest that}} morphine may have protective properties in management of cardiac toxicity in patients who receive ATO as an anti-cancer treatment...|$|E
30|$|Nevertheless, {{despite their}} lack of viability, <b>tetrazolium</b> <b>bromide</b> {{staining}} demonstrated not only that oospores of Phytophthora pluvialis were alive in the freshly prepared suspensions in both Study 1 and Study 2, but that their vitality also decreased with time {{in a similar manner}} to that of Phytophthora kernoviae in the same studies. It is noteworthy that with both species oospore vitality as measured by <b>tetrazolium</b> <b>bromide</b> staining was greater than that indicated by oospore germination, a result that mirrored those of Widmer ([2011]), who speculated that for Phytophthora kernoviae, oospores become dormant at 30 °C, but may remain viable and be possibly able to germinate when dormancy is broken. For Phytophthora pluvialis, the resting oospores may require some kind of stimulus such as exposure to a host exudate or specific nutrient or an abrupt change in temperature or lighting before germination can occur (Zentmyer and Erwin [1970]; Erwin and Ribeiro [1996]).|$|R
