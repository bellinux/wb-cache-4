5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1950 season, Linde signed a new {{contract}} with the Indians, but was released in February and sent to the Portland Beavers in the PCL. Over the course of the season, Linde won 5 games and lost 13 in 47 appearances, 18 of them starts, and amassed an ERA of 4.66. The following year, in 1951, Linde became a regular starter on the team, and before the end of April he had won as many games as he had won all of last year. He finished the season with a 12–12 record and a 4.29 ERA in 32 starts. In 1952, Linde remained part of the core starting rotation of <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> years alongside Red Adams and Marino Pieretti. His performances included one against the Angels in which Linde kept the team to five hits as the Beavers won 4–3 in 11 innings. He won 11 games, lost 15, threw 119 strikeouts, and brought his ERA down to 3.10 in 41 season appearances, 28 of them starts. In 1953, Linde started the season strong unlike his fellow pitchers, opening his season with a 2–1 victory against the Angels on April 3. In early May, he ended Ted Beard's streak of hitting safely in 12 straight at-bats, which tied the PCL record at the time. Shortly afterward, Linde won what was considered an odd performance as he allowed 15 hits and 20 runners on base, yet won a game against the Sacramento Solons 8–3. In his final professional season, Linde pitched in 36 games and finished with a 13–10 record and a 3.36 ERA.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> <b>coupling</b> {{capacitances}} between conductors was extracted using charge distributions directly. In {{this paper}} {{a set of}} new generalized variational formulas are derived. They are complete since they are valid not only for self-capacitances, but also for mutual capacitances. As for the realistic numerical implementation, elastance matrices become asymmetrical because of numerical method used. Then a more general variational formula is derived {{to account for the}} asymmetrical elastance matrix case. By these novel formulas the computational accuracy can be significantly improved compared to the conventional capacitance extraction method. 1...|$|R

25|$|Another {{influential}} {{factor is}} oil revenues. Historically, in periods of {{high oil prices}} and the consequent petrodollar windfall, imports accelerate rapidly in virtually all consumption categories including agricultural products. This, in turn, results in crowding out domestic production and damage to the agriculture sector. After the oil price spikes following 1973, agricultural imports also increased dramatically and caused significant damage to domestic production. Between 1970 and 1976, agricultural imports grew at the staggering annual rate of 35%. This experience was repeated in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couple</b> of years when oil prices were at or over $100 per barrel; {{the result is that}} agricultural imports have increased at a rapid pace and foreign products now form a sizeable chunk of the household consumption basket. Over the past few years, there have been significant price increases in agricultural products in Iran. This is due both to rising domestic demand and to rising global commodity prices.|$|E

Methods: Hospital based retrospective cohort study was conducted from January 2009 to December 2013 at University hospital located in Northwest Ethiopia. Human subject research approval for this study was received from University of Gondar Research Ethics Committee and the medical director of the hospital.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanical}} {{behavior of the}} vocal folds, lumped parameter models of the vocal folds have been developed in <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> <b>Coupling</b> with {{a model of the}} aerodynamics in the glottis provides the possibility of simulating glottal waves. A new method is presented to obtain values for the masses and springs of the lumped parameter models by using a finite-element method model of the vocal folds. This finite-element method model is based on geometry and material data from the literature, resulting in a model that describes the vocal fold in a realistic way. Requiring the dynamic behavior of the lumped parameter model of the vocal fold to be equal to the dynamic behavior of the finite-element method model of the vocal fold, parameter values are obtained that are purely based on dynamic considerations. Therefore, the behavior of the vocal folds is described in a realistic way by these parameters. These values are compared with the values used by previous authors and are implemented in lumped parameter models. Self-sustained oscillation is achieved with the new values for masses and springs.

40|$|The widely {{existing}} MECs in Nature {{have inspired}} researchers to design synthetic analogs {{to promote the}} overall catalytic efficiency in vitro by co-localizing multiple enzymes to mimic the MECs 2 ̆ 7 unique functionalities. A number of efforts have been devoted to designing synthetic MECs in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>couples</b> of decades. This thesis work has focused on developing novel strategies based on enzyme immobilization to design nano-carriers for multi-enzyme co-localization to realize kinetics enhancement and strong control of spatial arrangement of the enzymes. Three distinct approaches have been designed using different attachment methods and platforms. First, the multifunctional polystyrene nanoparticles were designed for immobilization and sequential co-localization of GOX and SHRP enzymes using covalent binding and streptavidin-biotin coupling attachment techniques. The sequentially co-localized GOX and SHRP on B/C-PS nanoparticles were capable of enhancing the overall conversion rate by approximately two-fold compared to the equivalent concentration of free enzymes in solution. Secondly, amphiphilic Pluronic-QD micelles were designed to co-localize multiple enzymes to investigate {{the effect of a}} more flexible substrate compared to the rigid polystyrene particles.
