It is no longer necessary for the student to go to a particular room, at a particular hour, to hear the golden words drop from the lips of a particular teacher. The young man who reads at eleven o'clock in the morning in luxurious rooms in Trinity College, Cambridge, will have no very marked advantage over another young man, employed during the day, who reads at eleven o'clock at night in a bed-sitting-room in Glasgow.

40|$|Abstract. The well established, gold {{standard}} approach to {{finding out what}} works in education research is to run a randomized controlled trial (RCT) using a standard pre-test and post-test design. RCTs {{have been used in}} the intelligent tutoring community for decades to determine which questions and tutorial feedback work best. Practically speaking, however, ITS creators need to make decisions on what content to deploy without the luxury of running an RCT. Additionally, most log data produced by an ITS is not in a form that can be evaluated for learning effectiveness with traditional methods. As a result, there is much data produced by tutoring systems that we as education researchers would like to be learning from but are not. In prior work we introduced one approach to this problem: a Bayesian knowledge tracing derived method that could analyze the log data of a tutoring system to determine which items were most effective for learning among a set of items of the same skill. The method was validated by way of simulations. In the current work we further evaluate this method and introduce a second, learning gain, analysis method for comparison. These methods were applied to 11 experiment datasets that investigated the effectiveness of various forms of <b>tutorial</b> <b>help</b> in a web-based math tutoring system. We found that the <b>tutorial</b> <b>help</b> chosen by the Bayesian method as having the highest rate of learning agreed with the learning gain analysis in 10 out of 11 of the experiments. An additional simulation study is presented comparing the statistical power of each method given different sample sizes. The practical impact of this work is an abundance of knowledge about what works that can now be learned from the thousands of experimental designs intrinsic in datasets of tutoring systems that assign items or feedback conditions in an individually-randomized order...|$|E

40|$|Today, {{standard}} software on widely-used platforms is employed {{by a large}} number of people. This user population is often quite heterogeneous, because people tend to have different preferences, knowledge, goals, etc. In order to satisfy individual needs, software systems can employ user modeling techniques to adapt their behaviour to each user. User modeling shell systems provide these techniques for application developers, but are rarely available on widelyused platforms. In this paper, we present BGP-MS-Jr., a limited version of the user modeling shell BGP-MS, which runs under MS-Windows. BGP-MS-Jr. is being used as the basis for a user modeling system that serves as an intelligent component of WING-MIT, a <b>tutorial</b> <b>help</b> system.
