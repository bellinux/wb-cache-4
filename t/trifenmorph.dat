40|$|The {{fate of the}} {{molluscicide}} <b>trifenmorph</b> (N-tritylmorpholine) {{following its}} use in irrigation systems to control the intermediate hosts of schistosomes was studied by laboratory and field experiments. Laboratory studies with 14 C-trifenmorph indicated that bean plants did not take up detectable residues when the soil {{in which they were}} grown was irrigated with water containing <b>trifenmorph</b> in concentrations likely to occur in the field. These laboratory studies have been complemented by field irrigation studies of growing crops in southern Africa and the Sudan. Residues of <b>trifenmorph</b> and its breakdown product triphenylmethanol could not be detected in the crops and the limit of detectability was 0. 01 - 0. 02 ppm. These results indicate that residues {{are not likely to be}} present in irrigated crops following the treatment of the irrigation water systems with <b>trifenmorph...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{large-scale}} {{field trial}} {{was carried out}} during December 1973 to assess the effect of <b>trifenmorph</b> on Bulinus truncatus and Biomphalaria pfeifferi in 379 000 feddans (â‰ˆ 159 000 ha) of the Gezira irrigation system in the Sudan. The commercial formulation used (Frescon) is an emulsifiable concentrate containing 16. 5 % <b>trifenmorph.</b> Five dispensers were used to add the commercial product to the water continuously for 7. 5 days; 18 121 litres were used to treat 28. 4 million m 3 of water. In addition, each minor canal was hand-sprayed from the tail to 300 m upstream of the last open field outlet pipe; 360 litres of the commercial formulation were used for this operation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Trifenmorph</b> {{granules}} provided 100 % {{control of}} Biomphalaria glabrata and B. tenagophila when applied at 2 kg of active ingredient per hectare, except at one site with a pH of 5. 6 where the snail population was reduced by only 50 %. Granulation {{was found to}} facilitate application by either hand or mistblower, and {{reduces the risk of}} infection to the spray team. Applied to canal margins the granules had a residual toxic effect...|$|E
