In a Council of State on 21 August, Schlytter, Tønsberg, Robert Porten and Heggenes were awarded the Medal for Heroic Deeds. The medals were presented in a ceremony at Hotel Continental, Oslo some days later.|$|E
5|$|In mid-June 1941, the {{division}} received new orders to relocate. The 16th Panzer Division crossed the German–Polish border at Groß Wartenberg heading for Ożarów at the Vistula, which was reached on 19 June 1941. The German soldiers initially believed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> going to transit through Russia, {{on their way}} to the Middle East where they would link up with Erwin Rommel's Afrika Corps. But Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Walther von Reichenau, who visited his son, a Leutnant in the 4th company of Panzer-Regiment 2, revealed to them the true objective of the next campaign. It would be Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} view of equites cohortales (the cavalry arm of cohortes equitatae), as expounded by G.L. Cheesman, was <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> a mounted infantry with poor-quality horses. They {{would use}} their mounts simply {{to reach the}} battlefield and then would dismount to fight. This view is today discredited. Although {{it is clear that}} equites cohortales did not match equites alares (ala cavalrymen) in quality (hence their lower pay), the evidence is that they fought as cavalry {{in the same way as}} the alares and often alongside them. Their armour and weapons were the same as for the alares.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{location}} of the Stamford Bridge battlefield is not known. Local tradition places the battlefield east of the River Derwent and just southeast of the town in an area known as Battle Flats. The {{location of the}} Norwegian army {{at the start of}} the battle is not known for certain. Accounts of their location differ, depending on sources and interpretations. A common view is that the Norwegian army was divided in two; with some of their troops on the west side of the River Derwent and the bulk of their army on the east side. Another interpretation is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> leaving Stamford Bridge and moving along the old Roman road toward York (west side of the River Derwent).|$|E
25|$|Others, like Sir Robert Thompson, {{himself an}} ex-Chindit, have {{asserted}} that the idea behind the Chindits was a sound one, but <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> badly handled and used in operations {{for which they were}} not properly equipped or trained, for example in static defence. A third view is that, despite the relatively insignificant losses that the Chindits were able to inflict, their propaganda value in 1943, {{at a time when the}} Army was on the defensive, was a morale boost to the people of India and Britain, and helping to dispel the image of Japanese invincibility. It has been hard to reach a consensus on any of these issues due to the partisan nature of the discussions surrounding Wingate himself.|$|E
25|$|The {{clothing}} industry in New York City was staffed by many immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. Historian Witold Kula {{found that many}} Jewish immigrants, and to a much lesser extent, Italians, were identified upon their arrival to the United States as having work background as tailors {{even if they did}} not. Kula identified several letters written by Jewish immigrants back to their families in Poland indicating <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> learning the trade, when in fact, they had papers stating that it was their native profession. The new immigrants generally did not speak English nor did the immigration agents speak any Polish, Yiddish, or Italian. Kula suggests that the Immigration agents were influenced by the demands of the workforce and essentially staffed the industries based on their expectations of each ethnic group. By 1912, the needle trades were the largest employer of Polish Jews in the United States, and 85% of the needle trade employees were Eastern European Jews.|$|E

Believing that the key to taking Sattelberg lay in having the 2/24th in a position to support the 2/48th's final attack, Whitehead pressured for the tanks to get up to the 2/24th as soon as possible.|$|E
500|$|This was {{the third}} time that an episode of The Simpsons focused on homosexuality. The episode—written by J. Stewart Burns and {{directed}} by Nancy Kruse—was inspired by the 2004 same-sex weddings that occurred in San Francisco. According to executive producer Al Jean, the staff wanted the episode to explore what the different characters' stances on same-sex marriage were. Around {{the time of the}} episode's original airdate, February 20, 2005, the same-sex marriage question was a hot political issue in the United States and the episode became controversial. [...] "There's Something About Marrying" [...] received a lot of criticism from conservative groups, including the Parents Television Council and the American Family Association, that claimed it was promoting gay marriage. Jean stated in response that the staff was not taking a side on the issue and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> examining all sides of it. Positive reaction to the episode came from, among others, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation and the gay-oriented website AfterEllen.com.|$|E
500|$|The Delannes, {{who gave}} {{testimony}} at the trial, described Yusuf as {{serving as the}} cook and Shire's representative, Awil as the sailor, Yacub as an interpreter, Ahmoud as a [...] "warrior," [...] and Guelleh as the fisherman responsible for feeding the pirate and captives. Sarkozy's speech was also entered into the trial as evidence. Psychiatrist Jean-Claude Archambault examined the defendants and concluded that Mohamud had developed a mental illness during imprisonment. The prosecution argued that the Somalis, who described themselves as [...] "simple fishermen," [...] were [...] "dangerous terrorists." [...] Prosecutor Anne Obez-Vosgien requested 14–16 year sentences for Mohamud, Awil, and Ahmoud, a 13–15 year sentence for Yacub, eight years for Yusuf, and six years for Guelleh. The lawyers for the accused took {{the case to the}} European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), saying their arrest and transfer was illegal; they also argued that the alleged pirates on trial were scapegoats for [...] "the main culprits". According to Le Monde diplomatique, [...] "the trial revealed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> following the orders of a powerful local man , who was identified but never investigated." ...|$|E

[...] The Masked Avengers also admitted that the call was [...] "probably the biggest [...] we've ever done."
