5|$|As a result, Bach Xuan Nguyen, {{who led the}} investigation, {{ordered the}} posthumous humiliation of Duyệt. This {{resulted}} in the desecration of his tomb, the execution of sixteen relatives, and the arrests of his colleagues. Minh Mạng's attitude led Duyet's adopted son Khoi <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> prison and start a revolt against the emperor on 10 May 1833.|$|E
5|$|Calvin did {{not live}} to see the {{foundation}} of his work grow into an international movement; but his death allowed his ideas <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their city of origin, to succeed far beyond their borders, and to establish their own distinct character.|$|E
5|$|On 18 May, the {{situation}} worsened and Stavka suggested once more stopping the offensive and ordering the 9th Army <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the salient. Timoshenko and Khruschev {{claimed that the}} danger coming from Wehrmacht's Kramatorsk group was exaggerated, and Stalin refused the withdrawal again. The consequences of losing the air battle were also apparent. On 18 May the Fliegerkorps VI destroyed 130 tanks and 500 motor vehicles, while adding another 29 tanks destroyed on 19 May.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Verrières Ridge was {{a series}} of engagements fought as part of the Battle of Normandy, in western France, during the Second World War. The main combatants were two Canadian {{infantry}} divisions—with additional support from the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade—against elements of three German SS Panzer divisions. The battle was part of the British and Canadian attempts <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Caen, and took place from 19–25 July 1944, being part of both Operation Atlantic (18–21 July) and Operation Spring (25–27 July).|$|E
5|$|The game's protagonist is Richard B. Riddick (reprised by Vin Diesel), {{a murderer}} {{recently}} confined in Butcher Bay. Riddick is resourceful, and seeks <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the prison {{by any means}} necessary. His capturer is the bounty hunter William J. Johns (Cole Hauser); the two have had previous encounters. Butcher Bay's warden is a man named Hoxie (Dwight Schultz), while Abbott (Xzibit) is a prison guard disliked by the inmates. The inmate Pope Joe (Willis Burks II) is an insane old man, {{who lives in the}} sewer tunnels beneath the prison.|$|E
5|$|Uneven heating {{can cause}} newly {{generated}} gases <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a weak {{spot on the}} surface of comet's nucleus, like a geyser. These streams of gas and dust can cause the nucleus to spin, and even split apart. In 2010 it was revealed dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) can power jets of material flowing out of a comet nucleus. Infrared imaging of Hartley 2 shows such jets exiting and carrying with it dust grains into the coma.|$|E

5|$|Between 24 April and 1 May, the IX Army {{fought a}} desperate action <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the pocket {{in an attempt}} to link up with the XII Army. Hitler assumed that after a {{successful}} breakout from the pocket, the IX Army could combine forces with the XII Army and would be able to relieve Berlin. There is no evidence to suggest that Generals Heinrici, Busse, or Wenck thought that this was even remotely strategically feasible, but Hitler's agreement to allow the IX Army to break through Soviet lines allowed many German soldiers to escape to the west and surrender to the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|From the northeast, the 2nd SS Panzer Division planned {{an assault}} in force against the four {{infantry}} battalions and two armoured regiments of the Polish 1st Armoured Division dug in on Hill 262. The 9th SS Panzer Division would {{attack from the}} north, while simultaneously preventing Canadian units from reinforcing the Polish armoured division. Having managed <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Falaise Pocket, the 10th SS, 12th SS and 116th Panzer Divisions would then attack Hill262 from the southwest. If this major obstacle could be cleared, German units could initiate a full withdrawal from the Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|Having survived {{until the}} end of the time stop, the LEP is bound by law and leaves the {{remaining}} gold and departs. At the end, Butler demands an explanation as to how Artemis came up with the idea of using sleeping pills. Artemis explains that he had gotten the idea from old fairy tales, in which human characters never wake up at an inopportune moment for the fairies, and had guessed that time-stops were the reason. Concluding that the time-stop forces a being to stay in whichever state of consciousness they were in when the time-stop is started, Artemis uses sleeping pills <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the time-stop. Artemis finds his mother has fully recovered from her insanity thanks to Holly's magic.|$|E
50|$|In Sant Mat {{the word}} Simran {{is used for}} the spiritual {{practice}} of repeating the mantra given by the Satguru during initiation. The mantra itself is also called Simran. Simran repetition is done during meditation and also outside it, however this mantra is later dropped in favor of real feeling of self or the God, which happens due <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> monotony through Jap. Thus mantra is used only till the point, monotony and previously formed patterns are broken. After it pure Simran is carried by the sadhak.|$|R

5|$|In Escape from Butcher Bay, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} Richard B. Riddick and {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Butcher Bay prison. The game incorporates elements from video game genres such as first-person shooter, adventure and stealth, and is played primarily from a first-person perspective, though the camera switches to a third-person perspective during certain scenes. Unlike many first-person shooters, the game contains no head-up display; on-screen cues are limited to flashes when a new weapon is selected, and small, white boxes that display the player character's health when damage is taken. Health can be replenished in designated areas throughout the game. By finding cigarette packs hidden in levels, the player can unlock concept art and video files.|$|E
5|$|In January Manstein {{was forced}} to retreat further west by the Soviet offensive. Without waiting for {{permission}} from Hitler, he ordered the German XI and XXXXII Corps (consisting of 56,000 men in six divisions) of Army Group South <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Korsun Pocket during the night of 16–17 February 1944. By the beginning of March, the Soviet forces had driven the Wehrmacht well back of the river. Because of Hitler's directive of 19 March that from that point forward all positions were to be defended to the last man, Manstein's 1st Panzer Army became encircled on 21 March when permission to break out was not received from Hitler in time. Manstein flew to Hitler's headquarters in Lvov {{to try to convince}} him to change his mind. Hitler eventually relented, but relieved Manstein of his command on 30 March 1944.|$|E
5|$|In late July and August 1914, Habsburg {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the III Battleship Division of the Austro-Hungarian navy, {{under the command of}} Captain Miklós Horthy. The battleship, along with her sister ships {{and the rest of the}} Austro-Hungarian Navy, were mobilized to support the flight of SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau from 28 July to 10 August 1914. The two German battlecruisers were stationed in the Mediterranean Sea and were attempting <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the strait of Messina, which was surrounded by British troops and vessels, and make their way to Turkey. After the Germans successfully escaped the strait, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was recalled. The fleet had advanced as far south as Brindisi in southeastern Italy.|$|E

2500|$|For Horkheimer, {{approaches}} to understanding {{in the social}} sciences cannot simply imitate those in the natural sciences. Although various theoretical approaches would come close <b>to</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ideological constraints that restricted them, such as positivism, pragmatism, neo-Kantianism, and phenomenology, Horkheimer argued that they failed because all were subject to a [...] "logico-mathematical" [...] prejudice that separates theoretical activity from actual life (meaning that all these schools sought to find a logic that always remains true, independently of and without consideration for ongoing human activities). According to Horkheimer, the appropriate response to this dilemma is the development of a critical theory.|$|R
50|$|After {{managing}} <b>to</b> <b>break</b> Leo <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{prison and}} finalizing the plan with Rico, Dominic is {{surprised by the}} arrival of Letty Ortiz. The two drive together to a beach, and rekindle their romance.|$|R
5|$|Offshore, Sirius had {{blockaded}} Saint Paul {{after landing}} her soldiers and, on 9 July, observed a ship attempting <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the harbour after hearing {{news of the}} surrender. Sirius sent her barge, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant George Norman, to pursue the fugitive. In an exhausting twelve-hour chase, Norman was able to catch and board the ship, revealed to be a privateer named Edward carrying four guns and 30 men. Norman was able to defeat the crew in a brief struggle in which three men were wounded, and discovered that she was carrying despatches from the French government for the authorities on Isle de France, all of which fell into British hands.|$|E
5|$|On 28 June, Model {{was sent}} to rescue Army Group Centre, which had been torn apart by Operation Bagration, the Soviet {{offensive}} in Belorussia. The Ninth Army (Model's old command) and Fourth Army were trapped, and the Red Army was about to liberate Minsk. Despite the catastrophic situation, Model believed that he could still hold Minsk, but this would require Fourth Army <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its pocket, and reinforcements to counter-attack the Soviet advance. The reinforcements, in turn, could only be obtained by pulling back, thus shortening the line and freeing up troops. The consensus is that the German position was doomed, regardless of what Model could have done, but Hitler refused to sanction either Fourth Army's escape or a general withdrawal, {{until it was too}} late.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November Major J.G. Rees of the 25th Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers {{had only}} 60 men to hold Beit Ur el Foqa when the post was almost surrounded. They managed <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the {{position}} and joined the support company of the 10th Battalion, King's Shropshire Light Infantry covering Et Tire and facing Signal Hill, which {{became the focus of}} the next Ottoman attack. This came at 14:30 when they attacked with 400 soldiers, driving the detachment from Signal Hill. This move made Et Tire untenable and forced the 10th King's Shropshire Light Infantry to fall back to its original line.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 14 mm. Adults have an unusual sclerotised {{plate on the}} tip of the abdomen containing small spines, which is probably used <b>to</b> help <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the pupal cocoon. They are on wing in July and August.|$|R

5|$|The {{developing}} stalemate saw {{activity on}} both sides of the bay. Among the French fleet there was dissatisfaction that Willaumez had not attacked Stopford when he enjoyed numerical superiority, taking the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the anchorage and pursue his objectives in the Caribbean. Captain Jacques Bergeret was so incensed that he wrote a letter criticising Willaumez to the Minister of Marine Denis Decrès, and warning that the Aix Roads were highly vulnerable to British attack. Although Emperor Napoleon apparently shared Willaumez's opinion, Decrès removed and censured both Willaumez and Bergeret, replacing the admiral with Zacharie Allemand on 16 March. Word had arrived that a British expeditionary force had captured Martinique in late February, and so Allemand, lacking further instructions, prepared his defences.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} {{service in}} 1916, Provence {{and her sisters}} {{were assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, with Provence as the fleet flagship. The three ships remained in the unit {{for the remainder of the}} war. They spent the majority of their time at Corfu to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from attempting <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Adriatic. The fleet's presence was also intended to intimidate Greece, which had become increasingly hostile to the Triple Entente. Later in the war, men were drawn from their crews for anti-submarine warfare vessels. As the Austro-Hungarians largely remained in port for the duration of the war, Provence saw no action during the conflict. Indeed, she did not leave port at all for the entirety of 1917. In April 1919, she returned to Toulon. The French Navy intended to send the ship to the Black Sea to join operations against the Bolsheviks, but a major mutiny prevented the operation. She and Lorraine went to Constantinople in October 1919, where they formed the core of the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron.|$|E
5|$|After safely {{returning}} to port in Kiel, Leipzig {{was taken into}} the Deutsche Werke shipyard for repairs. She was decommissioned while under repair and reclassified as a training ship. To accommodate additional training crews, four of the ship's boilers were removed. She returned to service in late 1940. In early June 1941, she escorted the heavy cruiser Lützow (formerly Deutschland) to Norway. After {{she returned to the}} Baltic, she and the cruiser Emden provided artillery support to advancing German ground forces during Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union. In September, she supported the invasion of the Baltic islands in the West Estonian archipelago. While bombarding Soviet positions on Moon Island, Leipzig was attacked unsuccessfully by the Soviet submarine Shch-317. In late September, the ship joined the German Baltic Fleet, centered on the battleship Tirpitz; the fleet was tasked with blocking a possible Soviet attempt <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Baltic. Leipzig returned to Kiel in October, and conducted maneuvers with the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer. Leipzig became the flagship of the training fleet in 1942; she spent the year performing training duties.|$|E
5000|$|Hammer later {{sent the}} Rhino (who Hammer once {{provided}} a removable {{version of his}} armor <b>to)</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> Blizzard <b>out</b> <b>of</b> prison. He sent his [...] "B-Team" [...] (Blacklash, Blizzard, and Boomerang) to battle Ghost and Iron Man.|$|R
50|$|June 6 {{followed}} days later: The Longest Day, D-day, began. One {{and half}} million men assaulted and crowded onto {{the beaches of}} Normandy.
