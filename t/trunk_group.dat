50|$|The Revenue Assurance {{processes}} {{in many ways}} {{can be regarded as}} an auditing process. The objective is to ensure that policies of the organization are well implemented and that no or minimal revenue leakage is occurring. The RA processes have the capability to cover all departments and service lines in a telecommunications organization. There are many ways in which RA processes can be classified, however in view of an audit function; the RA processes can be categorized into Detective, Corrective and Preventive activities, controls or processes. Let's understand the difference {{with the help of an}} example. Supposing the objective is to ensure <b>trunk</b> <b>groups</b> correctly entered in the MSCs. The detective control would be to monitor <b>Trunk</b> <b>Groups</b> appearing in CDRs are harmonized with the master list and any deviations are reported. The corrective control would be to initiative a process and confirm with the Network / Wholesale team of all deviations found. The preventive control would be to set up a process with the Network / Wholesale team where all new <b>trunk</b> <b>groups</b> are first informed to the RA, Mediation, Wholesale and other essential departments and then made live on the Network.|$|R
50|$|If all trunks were busy, {{the marker}} did a route advance {{to operate a}} {{different}} route relay to select an alternate route via a tandem. This feature kept <b>trunk</b> <b>groups</b> small, and more heavily loaded with traffic, thus saving cost in outside plant.|$|R
25|$|The various {{switching}} entities in {{the building}} could share the same outgoing section, and this was particularly advantageous for trunks to particularly distant parts of the city, consolidating traffic {{that would otherwise be}} scattered among smaller and less efficient <b>trunk</b> <b>groups</b> or require using a tandem switch office.|$|R
50|$|The MSC is {{connected}} to a close telephone exchange by a <b>trunk</b> <b>group.</b> This provides an interface to the (Public Switched Telephone Network) (PSTN). It also provides connectivity to the PSTN. The region to be served by a Cellular Geographic Serving Area(CGSA) is split into geographic cells. These cells are ideally hexagonal in shape and they are initially laid out with their centers about 4 to 8 miles apart from each other. Other MTSO equipment, the cell site controllers provide control functions {{for a group of}} cell sites and actions of mobile phones through command and control data channels. To achieve this, {{there has to be a}} method of connectivity between the MTSO and the cell site. This may be by DS1, DS3, OCn or Ethernet circuits.|$|E
50|$|What’s the difference? In Type I systems, each {{radio in}} the <b>trunk</b> <b>group</b> {{individually}} transmits its own affiliation. In Type II systems the trunk system maintains a database that determines each radio's affiliation.Another difference between the systems is that Type I systems are arranged in a fleet-subfleet hierarchy. For example, {{it is possible for}} a city using a Type I system to designate four fleets, each with eight subfleets. The police department, fire department, utilities group, and city administration could each be a separate fleet. The police might decide to further divide its fleet into subfleets, such as dispatch, tactical operations, detectives, north, south, east and west side patrols and supervisors. All the available police radios would then be assigned to one of the police subfleets, letting the police centralize their communications and control the type of users on a single system. Determining the exact fleet-subfleet hierarchy for a particular area is referred to as fleet map programming.|$|E
50|$|Thanks to {{this more}} complex trunk circuit, {{outgoing}} trunks are selected by a quicker and more versatile method than the sleeve test previously used. Each trunk circuit provides a ground on an FT lead to indicate idleness. The FT leads for trunks {{in a particular}} group are cross-connected to a FTC (frame test common) lead for its trunk link frame, {{to indicate that the}} TLF has one or more idle trunks in that group. The route relay in the completing marker connects sensor relays to all the trunk link frames, allowing the marker to choose a TLF that has an idle trunk and then connect to that trunk through the trunk link connector (TLC) to choose one of those idle trunks. This two step method, along with the mixing of incoming and outgoing traffic, distributed traffic more evenly, thus alleviating the link congestion problems that often arose with earlier methods that restricted a <b>trunk</b> <b>group</b> to one or two outgoing switch frames.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, a spill-forward {{feature is}} a service feature, in the {{operation}} of an intermediate office, that, acting on incoming trunk service treatment indications, assumes routing control of the call from the originating office. This increases the chances of completion by offering the call to more <b>trunk</b> <b>groups</b> than are available in the originating office.|$|R

Via message, Pacocha informed those on the surface that there were twenty-two survivors.|$|R
50|$|If {{the phone}} number is not passed or {{the phone number}} {{is not in the}} ALI database, this is known as ALI Failure; the call is then passed to the <b>trunk</b> <b>group's</b> default ESN, which is a PSAP {{designated}} for this function. The PSAP operator must then ask the incoming caller for their location and redirect them to the correct PSAP. The legal penalty in most states for ALI database lookup failure is limited to a requirement that the telephone company fix the database entry.|$|R
5000|$|The telex {{numbering}} plan, {{usually a}} six-digit {{number in the}} United States, {{was based on the}} major exchange where the customer's telex machine terminated. For example, all telex customers that terminated in the New York City exchange were assigned a telex number that started with a first digit [...] "1". Further, all Chicago-based customers had telex numbers that started with a first digit of [...] "2". This numbering plan was maintained by Western Union as the telex exchanges proliferated to smaller cities in the United States. The Western Union Telex network was built on three levels of exchanges. The highest level was made up of the nine exchange cities previously mentioned. Each of these cities had the dual capability of terminating telex customer lines and setting up trunk connections to multiple distant telex exchanges. The second level of exchanges, located in large cities such as Buffalo, Cleveland, Miami, Newark, Pittsburgh and Seattle, were similar to the highest level of exchanges in capability of terminating telex customer lines and setting up trunk connections. However, these second level exchanges had a smaller customer line capacity and only had trunk circuits to regional cities. The third level of exchanges, located in small to medium-sized cities, could terminate telex customer lines and had a single <b>trunk</b> <b>group</b> running to its parent exchange.|$|E

50|$|Rapid {{advances}} {{in the implementation of}} digital signal processing allowed echo cancellers to be made smaller and more cost-effective. In the 1990s, echo cancellers were implemented within voice switches for the first time (in the Northern Telecom DMS-250) rather than as standalone devices. The integration of echo cancellation directly into the switch meant that echo cancellers could be reliably turned on or off on a call-by-call basis, removing the need for separate <b>trunk</b> <b>groups</b> for voice and data calls. Today's telephony technology often employs echo cancellers in small or handheld communications devices via a software voice engine, which provides cancellation of either acoustic echo or the residual echo introduced by a far-end PSTN gateway system; such systems typically cancel echo reflections with up to 64 milliseconds delay.|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objective}} It {{is needed to}} explore the effects of operation on stress statue, myocardial damage and arrhythmia to lung cancer.

Methods 54 cases {{were divided into two}} groups randomly:the pulmonary vein trunk-ligation group (<b>trunk</b> <b>group,</b> 27 cases) and the pulmonary vein branch-ligation group (branch group, 27 cases). The blood concentrations of hydrocortisone (HC), blood glucose (BG) and cardial troponin-I (cTnI) were determined at different time point. The surgical data, the quantum of pain and ECG also recorded. Results ① There were no significance difference of the operation time, blood loss during operation and drainage volume in first day after operation between two groups. ② There're no differences of the quantum of pain between two groups. ③ The HC of the two groups' ascend obviously on the end of operation and descend during postoperative. ④ The BG of the two groups' rise on the 1 st day obviously, maintain high level on the 2 nd day, descend on the 3 rd day but still higher than that of preoperation. ⑤ The BG and HC show a direct positive correlation postoperative. ⑥ The cTnIs of the <b>trunk</b> <b>group</b> ascend immediatelyafter operation, but there's no statistically significance between two groups. ⑦ The arrhythmia incidence is higher in the <b>trunk</b> <b>group,</b> but the arrhythmia incidences classified by the date after operation of the two groups' show no distinction. Conclusion ① The effects of two pulmonary vein ligation styles on postoperative stress show no significance differences. ② The style of pulmonary vein trunk-ligation has a more obvious tendency to do harm to heart than that of branch-ligation. ③ The style of pulmonary vein branch-ligation may reduce the arrhythmia incidence after operation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the trunk grouping {{effect on the}} system performance, especially in a non-uniform traffic environment. In [1], Pattavina discussed the implementation issues of output trunk grouping in a switching system, studied the throughput improvement by computer simulations, and also calculated the bounds of packet loss rate. Also, the maximum throughput analysis with output trunk grouping was recently presented in [3] under uniform traffic conditions. We here provide the exact analysis of throughput, delay and loss, based on the technique developed in [4]. Especially, {{we are able to}} evaluate the system performance in a nonuniform traffic environment where a much more significant improvement by trunk grouping is observed. This is because the local congestions caused by individual heavily loaded output links can now be removed upon output trunk grouping. We further propose a new concept of input trunk grouping by letting each demultiplexer have the ability to skip those input links when their buffer is full. Hence, the incoming packet will be blocked if and only if when the buffers of all input links within the same <b>trunk</b> <b>group</b> are full. In contrast, by purely time-division demultiplexing, the packet is blocked when the buffer of presently held input link is full. Considering the high non-uniformity of input link traffic intensities, such an input trunk grouping will remove any possible local congestions of individual input links within each <b>trunk</b> <b>group.</b> The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 shows the system maximum throughput performance with different trunk groupings in both uniform and non-uniform traffic environments. In section 3, we evaluate the average input buffer size and packet loss rate with finite buffer size. The paper is then concluded in s [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Circuit {{reservation}} {{is a call}} {{admission control}} where offered calls are lost when the <b>trunk</b> <b>group</b> utilization reaches a certain limit. We present a modification of the standard circuit reservation control. Calls which exceed the circuit reservation limits are lost. Calls which are accepted are connected if circuits are available, otherwise they are queued by storing their call signalling information in a buffer. These calls will later be connected when circuits become available. The combination of circuit reservation and call queueing leads to a substantial reduction in the loss probability {{at the expense of}} a small connection delay. 1. Introduction This paper presents an analysis of a call admission control where some circuits are reserved for use by certain classes of traffic [4].

Early InWATS 800 calling lacked the complex routing features offered with modern toll-free service.
