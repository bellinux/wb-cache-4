Some researchers have attempted <b>to</b> <b>place</b> <b>a</b> dollar <b>figure</b> on ecosystem services such as the value that the Canadian boreal forest's contribution to global ecosystem services. If ecologically intact, the boreal forest has an estimated value of US$3.7 trillion. The boreal forest ecosystem is one of the planet's great atmospheric regulators and it stores more carbon than any other biome on the planet. The annual value for ecological services of the Boreal Forest is estimated at US$93.2 billion, or 2.5 greater than the annual value of resource extraction. The economic value of 17 ecosystem services for the entire biosphere (calculated in 1997) has an estimated average value of US$33 trillion per year. [...] These ecological economic values are not currently included in calculations of national income accounts, the GDP and they have no price attributes because they exist mostly outside of the global markets. The loss of natural capital continues to accelerate and goes undetected or ignored by mainstream monetary analysis.|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of some kinetic studies on {{photosynthesis}} of barley seedlings, {{it has been found}} that plants utilize C{sup 12 }O{sub 2 } faster than C{sup 14 }O{sub 2 }. The plants were <b>placed</b> in <b>a</b> closed system containing an infra-red absorption-cell for the analysis of total CO{sub 2 } and an ionization chamber for the determination of C{sup 14 }O{sub 2 } in the gas phase, both instruments recording continuously. Carbon dioxide, containing about 2 % C{sup 14 }O{sub 2 }, was introduced in the dark and the specific activity at this point taken as unity. After a short dark period, the lights were turned on and photosynthesis was allowed <b>to</b> take <b>place.</b> <b>A</b> <b>figure</b> shows the result of a typical experiment. During the initial dark period the specific activity fell because of dilution by inactive respired CO{sub 2 }. However, as photosynthesis proceeded, the specific activity of the residual CO{sub 2 } rose until, when only 1 / 6 of it remained, the specific activity reached a peak some 20 % higher than it had been at the start of photosynthesis. At this point the steady respiratory dilution became an appreciable fraction of the total remaining CO{sub 2 }, and the specific activity dropped rapidly...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} has been {{to develop a new}} method that can be used <b>to</b> <b>place</b> <b>a</b> {{monetary}} <b>figure,</b> reflecting full economic and societal value, on the volumes of fresh water that are consumed and degraded in agri-food product supply chains. Informed by the twin concepts of Total Economic Value and Ecosystem Services, a detailed review of the water valuation literature, which had been conducted within a welfare economic framework, suggested that the current evidence base is limited in terms of the number, type, coverage and robustness of existing estimates. Nonetheless, a method is developed which looks to provide an estimate of the direct use value of water in three agri-food supply chain case studies which are underpinned by raw materials that either significantly impact, or impacted by, global freshwater resources (wheat, tea and potatoes). These case studies are used to illustrate the merit of such an approach in terms of assessing the relative scarcity or impact of water use along globally disparate supply chains, and as a means promoting the trade-offs associated with productive and allocative efficiency gains. Indeed, it is argued that the principal contribution of the thesis is that it highlights the potential for the academic community to enable a more comprehensive approach to the valuation of virtual water flows. Such an approach would supplement the volumetric focus of water footprint assessment, and provide a more useful metric for business users than the current focus on the stress weighted water footprint...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} much {{discussion}} in both the media and political debate in recent times about the substantial and rising costs to the Australian Government of intercepting, detaining and processing asylum seekers arriving by boat. Criticism of these costs has come from many quarters, including refugee advocates and the current federal Opposition. Despite the volume of public comment on this issue, there is no comprehensive, publicly available source of data outlining the precise costs incurred in the interception, detention and processing of asylum seekers who arrive unauthorised by boat. No Australian government has ever provided <b>a</b> single <b>figure</b> estimate of {{the total cost of}} these activities. This is in part because the costs are incurred across a number of agencies and portfolios, but also because costs are incurred across various programs, many of which have broader objectives than the interception of irregular maritime arrivals (IMAs). This means that it is often difficult or impossible to disaggregate these costs. This background note outlines the various programs and agencies involved in the interception, detention and processing of asylum seekers. In order to paint a more complete picture of the costs associated with people smuggling, and the Government’s efforts to curb it, the paper also examines the programs relating to counter people smuggling activities, and the incarceration and prosecution of alleged people smugglers. It does not attempt <b>to</b> <b>place</b> <b>a</b> definitive <b>figure</b> on these costs. Rather, it highlights the available information on expenditure relating to these activities, {{as well as some of}} the difficulties in isolating expenditure that specifically relates to boat arrivals...|$|R
50|$|Rarer, but {{extremely}} {{characteristic of}} the Daunians, are elaborate grotesque ritual vases. One example is a ritual vase with <b>a</b> female <b>figure</b> opposite to the spout, in ceremonial dress with a fillet on her brow, long plaits of hair hanging down on her shoulders, and circular discs covering her ears. Instead of human figures, other examples have strange creatures with birds'-heads upon necks like serpents and other unusual experiments in zoomorphism (cf. also example 3, of an unpainted Daunian vessel). Apart from an occasional drawing of this kind, always quite schematic, the decoration of all Daunian vases is purely geometric. Squares, lozenges and triangles are the usual motives, arranged in panels of varying length and separated by vertical lines. Most of the decoration {{is placed on the}} upper half of the vase. In the school of Ruvo the fashion was <b>to</b> <b>place</b> <b>a</b> hanging trapezoidal <b>figure</b> on the lower half, but Canosa preferred horizontal bands or concentric circles on this otherwise empty field. Almost all the Daunian pottery was made by hand, but in a few of the finest kraters from Ruvo the wheel seems to have been used. The decorative designs were painted in two alternating colours, red and dark violet, generally but not always laid on a background of whitish slip.|$|R
