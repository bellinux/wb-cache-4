In 2016, there were more than 10 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.3 million deaths. This makes it the number one cause of death from an infectious disease. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries, and more than 50% in India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000.

40|$|Rationale: Diagnosis of latent {{tuberculosis}} infection (LTBI) is currently {{based on the}} <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test.</b> The enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT) is a new blood test to diagnose LTBI. Objective: To compare the ELISPOT and the <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> for detecting LTBI in contacts of patients with tuberculosis. Methods: Prospective study of 413 contacts of patients with tuberculosis. Measurements and Main Results: Because there is no gold standard for LTBI, the sensitivity and specificity of the ELISPOT and <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> cannot be directly measured. For each contact, we therefore estimated the likelihood of having LTBI by calculating a contact score that quantified exposure to and infectiousness of the index case. We analyzed the relationship of contact score to ELISPOT and <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> results. The likelihood of a positive ELISPOT (p = 0. 0005) and a <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> (p = 0. 01) increased significantly with rising contact scores. The contact score was more strongly related to the ELISPOT than to the <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> results, although this difference was not statistically significant. Among U. S. -born persons {{and those who were}} not vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin, approximately 30 % had positive ELISPOT or <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> results. Foreign-born, bacille Calmette-Guérin–vaccinated persons {{were significantly more likely to}} have a positive <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> than a positive ELISPOT result (p < 0. 0001). Conclusions: Compared with the <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test,</b> the ELISPOT appears to be at least as sensitive for diagnosis of LTBI in contacts of patients with tuberculosis...|$|R

Twenty-six subjects received two <b>tuberculin</b> <b>tests</b> (both 10 units) administered by the Mantoux technique—Tests 1 and 2. At Test 2 there was a significant increase in induration at 48 h (mean, 7. 8 mm; p< 0. 001), no difference at 72 h (mean, 0. 2 mm; p= 0. 93), and a reduction at 96 h (mean, 4. 2 mm; p= 0. 02). There were more positive results (15 mm induration) at Test 2 compared with Test 1 at 48 h (19 vs. 9, respectively; p= 0. 002), but similar numbers at 72 h (11 vs. 10, respectively).

40|$|Summary: The {{feasibility}} {{of carrying out}} <b>tuberculin</b> <b>testing</b> {{of children in the}} community and reliability of data collected, by general health workers are essential pre-requisites {{for the development of a}} surveillance methodology based on the study of infection rates.

Around 97 % of the eligible children in 0 - 9 years age group could he <b>tuberculin</b> <b>tested.</b> Thus, the community response to the activity was good. There was a high level of agreement between the standard tuberculin reader of the NTI and the trainee readers belonging to the general health services, in measuring tuberculin induration sizes of over 10 mm, especially over 14 mm (99 %). Also, in estimating the prevalence rates of infection on the basis of the two kinds of readings.

The study also showed that postvaccinal <b>tuberculin</b> <b>testing</b> is only of value in determining the level of the allergy in groups of persons.

50|$|By contrast, {{two forms}} of {{positive}} reactions are seen when tuberculoid or borderline cases of HD are assessed by the lepromin test. (There are three borderline diagnoses possible {{as well as the}} tuberculoid and lepromatous diagnoses in the Ridley-Jopling classification system. The severity of disease and thus assignment to one of the five diagnoses is related to the strength of the cell mediated immune response.) The Fernandez (early) reaction appears within two days and is roughly equivalent in nature and underlying mechanism to the response seen in tuberculosis patients reacting positively to the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test.</b> Induration of 5mm or more with erythema (redness), or 10mm without, 48 hours post injection are positive Fernandez reactions. Unlike the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> however, another reaction occurs in lepromatous patients at the injection site 21 days post injection, also appearing as induration and possible ulceration. This late positive reaction is known as the Mitsuda reaction. These reactions differ dependent on the type of lepromin antigen used.|$|E

The design of this study was cross sectional using systematik random sampling technique. Sample were drown from children with history of contacts with smear positive tuberculosis patients during 2012. This studies was from January until Juni  2013. The independent variables included age, sex, BCG immunization status, nutritional status, the average duration of exposure per day and residential density, the dependent variable was the <b>tuberculin</b> <b>test</b> results.

Objective: To describe how a novel T-cell-based test for M. tuberculosis infection helped diagnose tuberculosis in an asymptomatic, immunosuppressed adult with a negative result on a <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test.</b> Design: Case report. Setting: Household contact. Patients: Asymptomatic man receiving maintenance azathioprine therapy for Crohn disease whose wife had multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis.

Results: The man had a negative <b>tuberculin</b> skin <b>test</b> result and a positive ELISPOT assay result. High-resolution computed tomography of the chest showed consolidation with early cavitation. Bronchoalveolar lavage and culture confirmed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.
