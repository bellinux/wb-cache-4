50|$|Poirot, as {{a result}} of {{spreading}} fame, has been overworked and Hastings suggests he rests by accompanying him on a week's holiday to the south Devon coastal resort of Ebermouth. On their fourth day there, Poirot receives a note from the theatrical agent Joseph Aarons who asks him to travel to Charlock Bay on the north Devon coast as he needs to consult him on a matter. The two are planning to go by train but Hastings sees a notice for a motor bus tour from the one resort to the other which will save time on changing trains. Poirot reluctantly agrees, afraid of the uncertain English climate and the drafts of air which will invade the bus. They book their tickets at the office of <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>concerned</b> where Hastings is taken with another customer, an auburn-haired girl, whereas Poirot is intrigued by a young man who is attempting to grow a feeble moustache.|$|E
5000|$|A {{standards}} {{body and}} its associated processes cannot force a patent holder {{to give up its}} right to charge license fees, especially if <b>the</b> <b>company</b> <b>concerned</b> is {{not a member of the}} standards body and unconstrained by any rules that were set during the standards development process. In fact, this element discourages some standards bodies from adopting an [...] "open" [...] approach, fearing that they will lose out if their members are more constrained than non-members. Few bodies will carry out (or require their members to carry out) a full patent search. Ultimately, the only sanctions a standards body can apply on a non-member when patent licensing is demanded is to cancel the standard, try to rework around it, or work to invalidate the patent. Standards bodies such as W3C and OASIS require that the use of required patents be granted under a royalty-free license as a condition for joining the body or a particular working group, and this is generally considered enforceable.|$|E

Similarly, in Gencor v Dalby, the tentative suggestion was made that the corporate veil was being lifted where the company was the [...] "alter ego" [...] of the defendant.

It also promotes rationalization of transportation by shearing information among <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> <b>concerned</b> such as cargo owners, carriers, and management <b>companies.</b> To configure <b>the</b> system, mobile packet communication technology (satellite basis and mobile-phone basis) and digital map, which covers the whole sea and land, were applied.
