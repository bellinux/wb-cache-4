50|$|The {{moving parts}} and hinges can wear out or break. The most serious common problem arose {{because of a}} design fault in the screen cable where <b>tooling</b> <b>holes</b> caused {{unnecessary}} stressing due to additional bending of the cable at this point each time the Psion Series 5 was opened or closed and eventually leading to failure of the cable, which caused a serious display malfunction {{and the appearance of}} vertical lines on the screen. The screen cable to the Psion Series 5 was more durable than the screen cable of the Psion Series 5mx. There was an after-market cable available for the 5mx which aimed to eliminate this problem (see Psionflexi in the 'External links' below).|$|E

40|$|Machining of {{components}} on CNC machining centres without any datum reference or <b>tooling</b> <b>hole</b> details {{is a challenge}} and requires mapping of the CAD reference system with the CNC Machine reference system. Applying best fit alignment approach to position and orient CNC coordinate system for parts with free-form features is a subject that can be widely employed for machining {{of components}} in automobile and aircraft industry. The localization of part and fixing the coordinate system needs 3 D point data set obtained from the CNC machining centre using a touch signal probe. This paper focuses on establishing the CNC coordinate system for machining of components with 3 D free form surface whose datum coordinate system cannot be established because of the non availability of planar and straight surfaces for reference. The method adopted in this paper helps in accurately machining of such parts without the usage of any special fixtures. The research work aims to report some strategies that provide guidelines to select appropriate best fit techniques for achieving the machining quality in the shortest time.

40|$|Cryogenic {{machining}} {{opens up}} new industrial perspectives in difficult-to-cut materials like nickel-based alloys. In particular, drilling is {{an operation that}} generates high thermal and mechanical loading to the drill.

The objective {{of this study is}} to analyse tool performance during drilling of IN 718 using conventional metal working fluids (MWF) and cryogenic cooling conditions, and correlate it with the thermo-me- chanical phenomena. This study is conducted with standard coated cemented carbide twist drills, designed to work with MWF. The results show that drill performance under cryogenic cooling is strongly affected by its geometry. The axial force, drilling torque and tool wear/failure are higher under cryogenic cooling when compared to conventional MWF. Therefore, in order to take advantage of the cryo- genic machining, new drill design is required, which cur- rently is not available on the market.
