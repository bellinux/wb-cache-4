25|$|A locomotive's {{control system}} is {{designed}} so that the main generator electrical power output is matched to any given engine speed. Given the innate characteristics of traction motors, {{as well as the}} way in which the motors are connected to the main generator, the generator will produce high current and low voltage at low locomotive speeds, gradually changing to low current and high voltage as the locomotive accelerates. Therefore, the net power produced by the locomotive will remain constant for any given <b>throttle</b> <b>setting</b> (see power curve graph for notch 8).|$|E
25|$|Railroads {{generally}} preferred locomotives {{with fewer}} axles, to reduce maintenance costs. The {{number of axles}} required was dictated by the maximum axle loading of the railroad in question. A builder would typically add axles until the maximum weight on any one axle was acceptable to the railroad's maximum axle loading. A locomotive with a wheel arrangement of two lead axles, two drive axles, and one trailing axle was a high-speed machine. Two lead axles were necessary to have good tracking at high speeds. Two drive axles had a lower reciprocating mass than three, four, five or six coupled axles. They were thus able to turn at very high speeds due to the lower reciprocating mass. A trailing axle was able to support a huge firebox, hence most locomotives with the wheel arrangement of 4-4-2 (American Type Atlantic) were called free steamers {{and were able to}} maintain steam pressure regardless of <b>throttle</b> <b>setting.</b>|$|E
500|$|Because {{this type}} of {{aircraft}} control (with loss of control surfaces) is difficult for humans to achieve, some researchers have attempted to integrate this control ability into the computers of fly-by-wire aircraft. Early attempts to add the ability to real airplanes were not very successful; the software was based on experiments conducted in flight simulators where jet engines are usually modeled as [...] "perfect" [...] devices with exactly the same thrust on each engine, a linear relationship between <b>throttle</b> <b>setting</b> and thrust, and instantaneous response to input. Later, computer models were updated to account for these factors, and planes have been successfully flown with this software installed.|$|E
5000|$|The Stihl model shown {{combines}} the choke, <b>throttle</b> start <b>setting</b> and ignition switch into one unified control lever. Other brands of saw usually have separate controls for all three, or a combined <b>throttle</b> start <b>setting</b> and choke control {{with a separate}} ignition switch.|$|R
50|$|If {{the full}} power of reverse thrust is not desirable, thrust reverse can be {{operated}} with the <b>throttle</b> <b>set</b> {{at less than}} full power, even down to idle power, which reduces stress and wear on engine components. Reverse thrust is sometimes selected on idling engines to eliminate residual thrust, in particular in icy or slick conditions, or when the engines' jet blast could cause damage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Throttle</b> - <b>Sets</b> {{the desired}} power level. The {{throttle}} controls the mass flow-rate of air (in fuel-injected engines) or air/fuel mixture (in carburetted engines) {{delivered to the}} cylinders.|$|R
500|$|Cooling {{this large}} engine whilst minimising {{aerodynamic}} drag posed new challenges {{for both the}} Rolls-Royce and Supermarine design teams. Traditional cooling methods using honeycomb-type radiators were known to cause high drag in flight; consequently {{it was decided to}} use the surface skins of the S.6 wings and floats as heat exchangers, employing a double-skinned structure through which the coolant could circulate. Engine oil was cooled in a similar manner using channels in the fuselage and empennage skins. The S.6 was described at the time as a [...] "flying radiator", and it had been estimated that this coolant system dissipated the equivalent of 1,000hp (745kW) of heat in flight. However, even with this system in use, engine overheating was noted during the race flights, requiring the pilots to reduce the <b>throttle</b> <b>setting</b> to maintain a safe operating temperature.|$|E
2500|$|The pilots {{discovered}} a <b>throttle</b> <b>setting</b> that would maintain a descent in level attitude, with airspeed maintained between 125 and 140 knots; the nose rose when power was increased and fell when power was decreased. [...] Their {{rate of descent}} could be maintained at approximately 500 feet per minute.|$|E
2500|$|The thrust-to-weight ratio varies {{continually}} {{during a}} flight. [...] Thrust varies with <b>throttle</b> <b>setting,</b> airspeed, altitude and air temperature. [...] Weight varies with fuel burn and changes of payload. [...] For aircraft, the quoted thrust-to-weight ratio {{is often the}} maximum static thrust at sea-level divided by the maximum takeoff weight.|$|E
50|$|In August 2012, Six Flags Magic Mountain {{confirmed}} {{rumors that}} a new roller coaster, Full Throttle, would open the following season. Full Throttle opened as the park's 18th roller coaster, allowing Six Flags Magic Mountain to boast having the most roller coasters in the world once again. The ride was built to feature the world's tallest vertical loop on a roller coaster at 160 ft. In addition, Full <b>Throttle</b> <b>set</b> a record for being the first roller coaster to feature a track section with rails {{on both sides of}} the spine. This occurs at the top of the ride's massive inversion.|$|R

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} {{contacted the}} ground, left wing low, at full throttle, with the aircraft nose {{pointing to the}} left of the center-line. It had been planned that the aircraft would land wings-level, with the <b>throttles</b> <b>set</b> to idle, and exactly on the center-line during the CID, thus allowing the fuselage to remain intact as the wings were sliced open by eight posts cemented into the runway (called [...] "Rhinos" [...] due to the shape of the [...] "horns" [...] welded onto the posts). The Boeing 720 landed askew. One of the Rhinos sliced through the number 3 engine, behind the burner can, leaving the engine on the wing pylon, which does not typically happen in an impact of this type. The same rhino then sliced through the fuselage, causing a cabin fire when burning fuel was able to enter the fuselage.|$|R
2500|$|The prime mover's {{power output}} is {{primarily}} determined by its rotational speed (RPM) and fuel rate, which are regulated by a governor or similar mechanism. [...] The governor {{is designed to}} react to both the <b>throttle</b> <b>setting,</b> {{as determined by the}} engine driver and the speed at which the prime mover is running.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the load}} on the engine changes, its {{rotational}} speed will also change. This is detected by the governor through {{a change in the}} engine speed feedback signal. [...] The net effect is to adjust both the fuel rate and the load regulator position so that engine RPM and torque (and thus power output) will remain constant for any given <b>throttle</b> <b>setting,</b> regardless of actual road speed.|$|E
2500|$|North American locomotives, such {{as those}} built by EMD or General Electric, have nine {{throttle}} positions, one idle and eight power (as well as an emergency stop position that shuts down the prime mover). Many UK-built locomotives have a ten-position throttle. [...] The power positions are often referred to by locomotive crews as [...] "run 3" [...] or [...] "notch 3", depending upon the <b>throttle</b> <b>setting.</b>|$|E

40|$|The next {{generation}} {{reusable launch vehicle}} may utilize a Full-Flow Stage Combustion (FFSC) rocket engine cycle. One of the key technologies required {{is the development of}} an injector that uses gaseous oxygen and gaseous hydrogen as propellants. Gas-gas propellant injection provides an engine with increased stability margin over a range of <b>throttle</b> <b>set</b> points. This paper summarizes an injector design and testing effort that evaluated a coaxial rocket injector for use with gaseous oxygen and gaseous hydrogen propellants. A total of 19 hot-fire tests were conducted up to a chamber pressure of 1030 psia, over a range of 3. 3 to 6. 7 for injector element mixture ratio. Post-test condition of the hardware was also used to assess injector face cooling. Results show that high combustion performance levels could be achieved with gas-gas propellants and there were no problems with excessive face heating for the conditions tested...|$|R
25|$|Next, {{it is also}} a {{given that}} within that range of {{acceptable}} mixtures, there is but one ratio that is the ideal air-fuel ratio at that time, given the <b>throttle</b> position <b>set</b> by the pilot. In summary, {{it can be said that}} the ideal carburetor provides the correct air-fuel mixture ratio, as required by the engine, under all of its operating conditions.|$|R
2500|$|In older designs, {{the prime}} mover's {{governor}} and a companion device, the load regulator, {{play a central}} role in the control system. The governor has two external inputs: requested engine speed, determined by the engine driver's <b>throttle</b> <b>setting,</b> and actual engine speed (feedback). The governor has two external control outputs: fuel injector setting, which determines the engine fuel rate, and load regulator position, which affects main generator excitation. [...] The governor also incorporates a separate overspeed protective mechanism that will immediately cut off the fuel supply to the injectors and sound an alarm in the cab in the event the prime mover exceeds a defined RPM. [...] Not all of these inputs and outputs are necessarily electrical.|$|E

2500|$|The {{approach}} continued normally {{until about}} [...] from {{the threshold of}} the runway, when from an altitude of about , the CV-580 began a sustained climb for 11 seconds, after which the captain initiated a go-around procedure. However, the aircraft instead continued to climb; witnesses reported that the engines were running at a high <b>throttle</b> <b>setting</b> and that the aircraft rolled left and right two or three times during this time period. Flight 458 lost speed until it stalled 13 seconds after the initiation of the go-around. The aircraft entered a steep left bank, and its left wing struck the ground about [...] from a hangar located 1,600 feet (488 meters) {{to the left of the}} runway. At 8:22:23p.m. CST, the plane, now nearly inverted, struck the main door of the hangar with its left wing and crashed into the hangar bay.|$|E
40|$|A John Deere 8530 IVT tractor (Waterloo, Iowa) with a {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) that could be operated in automatic (CVT) or manual (fixed gear ratio) mode was tested for fuel consumption at a setpoint travel speed of 9 km·h‐ 1 with 17 different drawbar loads. Linear regression analysis results showed that with the <b>throttle</b> <b>set</b> to maximum in both transmission modes, operating the tractor with the transmission in the automatic mode was more fuel efficient than operating with the transmission in the manual mode when the drawbar power was approximately 78 %, or less, of maximum power. When load transition portions of the data were filtered out, {{there was no significant}} effect of load sequencing in the remaining data. On the other hand, there was a noticeable effect of travel direction which could occur due to a minor slope of the test track in the direction of travel. Testing of more tractor models from different manufacturers and at different travel speeds is needed to determine if these results can be applied to different tractor models produced by the same and/or other manufacturers...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two primary}} types of {{throttle}} position sensors (TPS): a potentiometer or a non-contact sensor Hall Effect sensor (magnetic device). A potentiometer is a satisfactory way for non-critical {{applications such as}} volume control on a radio, but as it has a wiper contact rubbing against a resistance element, dirt and wear between the wiper and the resistor can cause erratic readings. The more reliable solution is the magnetic coupling, which makes no physical contact, so will never be subject to failing by wear. This is an insidious failure as it may not provide any symptoms until there is total failure. All cars having a TPS have {{what is known as}} a 'limp-home-mode'. When the car goes into the limp-home-mode it is because the accelerator and engine control computer and the throttle are not talking to each other {{in a way that they}} can understand. The engine control computer shuts down the signal to the throttle position motor and a set of springs in the <b>throttle</b> <b>set</b> it to a fast idle, fast enough to get the transmission in gear but not so fast that driving may be dangerous.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Hunter regains {{consciousness}} and manages to limp back to Clearwater on his bike. While getting patched up there, Rusty finishes the armored car and shortly Hunter takes off in it, {{despite the fact}} that he is wounded. He attacks Straker's HQ, plowing through buildings and tents and eventually dropping a grenade into Straker's 50,000 litre diesel supply. He then runs and Straker, now in a towering rage, takes off after him. In the process, he forces the driver to overdo it in the truck, overheating the turbines. This stresses out the driver, (who loves the truck), and leads to dissension between him and Straker. Hunter meanwhile gets some distance ahead, jumps out of the car and climbs to a high place overlooking the road and it is now revealed that the whole attack on Straker's HQ was a ruse to lure the truck into an ambush. The Clearwater people are at the high place waiting for Hunter with his motorcycle and a rocket launcher which Hunter had given them earlier in the movie. Hunter fires a couple of rockets at the truck, one causes slight damage and a small fire, which causes more stress between Straker and the truck driver. The driver attempts to kill Straker, who he feels is uselessly destroying the truck, Straker kills the driver, who slumps over the wheel and now the truck, <b>throttles</b> <b>set</b> to full, is more or less out of control.|$|R
2500|$|And yet, [...] "synchronization", in {{the usual}} sense of the word, between the rate of fire of a machine gun (firing as such, in a fully {{automatic}} manner) and the revolutions per minute of a spinning aircraft propeller is also a conceptual impossibility. A machine gun normally fires at a constant number of rounds a minute, and while this may be boosted by (for instance) strengthening and increasing the tension on a return spring, or redirecting the gasses produced by each firing, it cannot be varied at will while the gun is operating. The propeller of an aircraft, on the other hand, turns at widely differing rates of revolution per minute, depending on the <b>throttle</b> <b>setting,</b> and whether the aircraft is climbing, flying level, or diving. Even if it were feasible to pick a particular point on an aircraft engine's tachometer at which a machine gun's cyclic rate would permit it to fire through the propeller – this would be very limiting.|$|E

40|$|Multi-core {{architectures}} {{introduce a}} new granularity at which process variations may occur, yielding asymmetry among cores that were designed—and that software expects—to be symmetric in performance. The chief source of this phenomenon are highly correlated, “systematic” within-die variations such as optical imperfections yielding variations across the exposure field. Per-core voltages {{can be used to}} bring all cores to the same performance level, but this compensation strategy also affects power, chiefly due to leakage power. Boosting a core’s frequency may therefore boost its leakage sufficiently to engage thermal <b>throttling.</b> This <b>sets</b> up a tradeoff between static performance asymmetry due to frequency variation versus dynamic performance asymmetry due to thermal throttling. This paper explores the potential magnitude of these effects...|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} is given of {{results from a}} 17 -flight evaluation of the F 100 Engine Model Derivative (EMD) powerplant in an F- 15 fighter. The EMD variant of the F 100 engine incorporates a larger fan, a higher temperature turbine, a digital control system, and a 16 -segment afterburner. These modifications result in a 15 to 20 percent increase in thrust which is exhibited in the reduction of F- 15 acceleration time to Mach 2. 0 by 23 percent. The only uncorrected shortcoming of the engine {{upon completion of the}} 17 -flight test course was the occurrence of compressor stalls at the <b>throttle's</b> idle <b>setting.</b> These stalls had not been predicted by either ground facility tests or compressor stability assessments...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Electric Propulsion System (AEPS) {{program will}} develop a flight 13 kW Hall {{thruster}} propulsion system based on NASA's HERMeS thruster. The AEPS system includes the Hall Thruster, the Power Processing Unit (PPU) and the Xenon Flow Controller (XFC). These three primary components must operate together {{to ensure that the}} system generates the required combinations of thrust and specific impulse at the required system efficiencies for the desired system lifetime. At the highest level, the AEPS system will be integrated into the spacecraft and will receive power, propellant, and commands from the spacecraft. Power and propellant flow rates will be determined by the <b>throttle</b> <b>set</b> points commanded by the spacecraft. Within the system, the major control loop is between the mass flow rate and thruster current, with time-dependencies required to handle all expected transients, and additional, much slower interactions between the thruster and cathode temperatures, flow controller and PPU. The internal system interactions generally occur on shorter timescales than the spacecraft interactions, though certain failure modes may require rapid responses from the spacecraft. The AEPS system performance model is designed to account for all these interactions in a way that allows evaluation of the sensitivity of the system to expected changes over the planned mission as well as to assess the impacts of normal component and assembly variability during the production phase of the program. This effort describes the plan for the system performance model development, correlation to NASA test data, and how the model will be used to evaluate the critical internal and external interactions. The results will ensure the component requirements do not unnecessarily drive the system cost or overly constrain the development program. Finally, the model will be available to quickly troubleshoot any future unforeseen development challenges...|$|R

2500|$|Preliminary {{analysis}} indicated that the plane's approach was too slow and too low. Eighty-two seconds before impact, {{at an altitude of}} about , the autopilot was turned off, the <b>throttles</b> were <b>set</b> to idle, and the plane was operated manually during final descent. NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman stated the pilots did not [...] "set the aircraft for an auto-land situation... They had been cleared for a visual approach and they were hand-flying the airplane," [...] adding: [...] "During the approach there were statements made in the cockpit first about being above the glide path, then about being on the glide path, then later reporting about being below the glide path. All of these statements were made as they were on the approach to San Francisco." [...] "Three seconds before the crash, someone in the cockpit called for the plane to abort the landing, or 'go around'. Then 1.5 seconds before impact, a different crew member again called for a ''". Both were spoken in the cockpit but not over the radio.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} calculations for {{the flight}} were that in early summer, including twilight, 20 hours of daylight were available for a westbound flight. By averaging 160 mi an hour, the distance of 2670 mi from New York to San Francisco could be covered in 16 hours 40 minutes. Mitchell had {{struck a deal with}} Curtiss Aircraft to purchase 25 new PW-8 fighters, patterned after the R-6 Racer, if Curtiss would help modify one of the prototypes for use in the project. The D-12 engine on the PW-8 produced [...] and Mitchell's intended modifications were to enable it to make the flight at full <b>throttle</b> power <b>setting.</b> If the armament and unnecessary equipment were also removed from the XPW-8, additional fuel capacity could be installed to extend its range, and larger oil tanks for engine cooling. The flight plan calculated four stops of 30 minutes each for refueling. McCook Field, Ohio; Saint Joseph, Missouri; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and remote Salduro Siding, Utah, were selected as refueling points, following a recently established mail route.|$|R
