5|$|The metal <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bluish tinge {{when exposed}} to air at room {{temperature}} for extended periods. Despite a high melting point in elemental form (2,468°C), it has a lower density than other refractory metals. Furthermore, it is corrosion-resistant, exhibits superconductivity properties, and forms dielectric oxide layers.|$|E
5|$|While H2 is {{not very}} {{reactive}} under standard conditions, it does form compounds with most elements. Hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electronegative, such as halogens (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I), or oxygen; in these compounds hydrogen <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> partial positive charge. When bonded to fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen, hydrogen can participate in a form of medium-strength noncovalent bonding with the hydrogen of other similar molecules, a phenomenon called hydrogen bonding that {{is critical to the}} stability of many biological molecules. Hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements, such as metals and metalloids, where it <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> partial negative charge. These compounds are often known as hydrides.|$|E

5|$|NY73 {{begins at}} {{a traffic light}} along NY86 near {{the eastern end of}} the village of Lake Placid in the town of North Elba. The highway heads towards the southwest, passing homes as Sentinel Road. At the {{intersection}} with Mill Pond Road, NY73 passes a small pond, crossing over an associated creek. For that short time, the highway <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> more southerly direction, mainly to the southeast. The surroundings of the highway remain the same as NY73 leaves Lake Placid via Cascade Road.|$|E
5|$|Pure lead has {{a bright}} silvery {{appearance}} {{with a hint}} of blue. It tarnishes on contact with moist air, and <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> dull appearance the hue of which depends on the prevailing conditions. Characteristic properties of lead include high density, malleability, and high resistance to corrosion (due to passivation).|$|E
5|$|Size-dependence: {{the rate}} of cluster {{diffusion}} has a strong dependence {{on the size of}} the cluster, with larger cluster size generally corresponding to slower diffusion. This is not, however, a universal trend and it has been shown in some systems that the diffusion rate <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> periodic tendency wherein some larger clusters diffuse faster than those smaller than them.|$|E

5|$|Water {{temperature}} {{affects the}} sea turtle's metabolic rate. Lethargy is induced at temperatures between 13 and 15°C (55 and 59°F). The loggerhead <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> floating, cold-stunned posture when temperatures drop to around 10°C. However, younger loggerheads are {{more resistant to}} cold and do not become stunned until temperatures drop below 9°C. The loggerheads' migration helps to prevent instances of cold-stunning. Higher water temperatures cause an increase in metabolism and heart rate. A loggerhead's body temperature increases in warmer waters more quickly than it decreases in colder water; their critical thermal maximum is currently unknown.|$|E
5|$|Abnormally {{developed}} milk caps infested by the parasitic sac fungus Hypomyces lateritius (syn. Peckialla laterita) are occasionally {{found in}} summer and autumn. The infested fruit bodies are usually more or less heavily malformed with a harder and more solid flesh than typical fruit bodies, {{so that they are}} more resistant to rot and can even survive the winter. They do not create gills; instead, the cap bottom is covered by an initially soft, white hyphen fungus, also known as a subiculum. Early on the mycelia becomes denser and <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> white-grey colour. The perithecia are created after about 10–14 days. Perithecia are fruit bodies of the Hypomyces and other sac fungi, in which the spindle-shaped asci are produced. Besides L.deterrimus, L.deliciosus and L.sanguifluus can become infested, rarely other milk caps. Hypomyces lateritius, H.ochraceus, H.rosellus, H.odoratus, among other Hypomyces species live parasitically on different milk caps and brittlegills {{as well as on the}} fruit bodies of species from other genera.|$|E

5|$|In Menominee County, the {{environment}} <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> more agricultural character along US2. The highway {{passes through the}} edge of the community of Hermansville before entering Powers. US2 comes to a three-way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US41. The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and Spaulding {{on the south side of}} the CN Railway. At Harris, the trunkline enters the Hannahville Indian Community. Harris is on the Menominee County side of the reservation, but as the highway continues east, it crosses over to Bark River on the Delta County side. The county line in between not only separates the two communities, but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones. East of Bark River, the highway crosses the community's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M‑69. The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of Escanaba.|$|E
5|$|NY83 {{begins at}} US62 in the hamlet of Conewango Valley, {{located in the}} northeastern corner {{of the town of}} Ellington. The route heads north-northwestward, {{paralleling}} a pair of train tracks, and shortly after enters the village of Cherry Creek, where it intersects County Route70 (CR70) and CR68, respectively. Known as Main Street, it bows out to the east slightly, and subsequently <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> due north path as it heads through the town of Cherry Creek. A couple miles later, it reaches the hamlet of Balcom Corners (located in the town of Villenova), a community situated at the junction of NY83 and the western terminus of NY322. Here, NY83 turns westward toward the community of Hamlet, where it intersects with CR72.|$|E
5|$|North of CR22, Rutgers Creek {{merges with}} Indigot Creek, a small stream forming {{part of the}} Minisink–Wawayanda town line. The {{combined}} stream continues {{to serve as the}} boundary between the two towns as Rutgers Creek <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> southeasterly course from this point. NY284 crosses over the waterway, entering Wawayanda and connecting to CR93 (Lime Kiln Road) just north of the town line. From CR93, the highway runs northeastward across open, rolling terrain, following an active part of the MNJ Railroad to the hamlet of Slate Hill. NY284 ends {{in the center of the}} community at a junction with US6.|$|E

5|$|North of Haskinville, NY21 <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> more northerly {{course through}} the county that {{eventually}} brings {{it to the}} village of Wayland, where it intersects I-390 at exit3 south of the village. The interchange also serves as the southern terminus of NY15 and is adjacent to the north end of NY415, which terminates north of the exit at NY21. NY15 joins NY21 north into the center of Wayland, where the two routes separate upon intersecting NY63. While NY15 continues north from the village into Livingston County, NY21 leaves Wayland on an eastwest alignment, roughly paralleling the northern county line and a B Rail Corporation line as it runs through a valley surrounding the Cohocton River. After , the road enters the hamlet of North Cohocton, centered around NY21's junction with the northern terminus of NY371.|$|E
5|$|Outside of Chappaqua, NY117 loosely {{parallels}} the Saw Mill River Parkway as it winds its way northeastward across residential parts of New Castle. The two parallel roads connect again {{by way of}} Roaring Brook Road, a four-lane arterial located midway between Chappaqua and the next community along NY117, the village of Mount Kisco. Roaring Brook Road also connects NY117 and the Saw Mill River Parkway to the global headquarters of Reader's Digest, which comprises a large complex bounded by NY117 {{to the east and}} the Metro-North tracks to the west. From here, NY117 <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> more pronounced northeasterly alignment that takes the route past Mount Kisco Country Club and into the village of Mount Kisco.|$|E

5|$|The eggs hatch at night, and {{the larvae}} swim {{to the water}} surface where they drift with the ocean currents, preying on zooplankton. This stage {{involves}} three moults and lasts for 15–35 days. After the third moult, the juvenile <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> form closer to the adult, and adopts a benthic lifestyle. The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild, and are poorly known, although they {{are known to be}} capable of digging extensive burrows. It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20,000 survives to the benthic phase. When they reach a carapace length of , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} <b>takes</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> more suburban residential {{character as}} the freeway approaches the Ann Arbor area. There are separate interchanges for US12 (Michigan Avenue) and I-94 on the southeast {{side of the}} city. Between I-94 and Washtenaw Avenue, US23 carries the Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) moniker as well. That secondary designation leaves the freeway and runs west on Washtenaw Avenue into downtown Ann Arbor and {{the campus of the}} University of Michigan. At the same interchange, a Business US 23 (Bus. US23) designation also follows Washtenaw Avenue to the west; east of US23, M-17 follows Washtenaw Avenue and connects the freeway with Ypsilanti. North of this interchange, US23 crosses the Huron River near the campus of the local community college and continues north to a junction with the M-14 freeway. The two merge and run westward along {{the north side of the}} city before US23 turns north and M-14 curves south.|$|E
