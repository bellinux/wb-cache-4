5|$|Attempting {{to combine}} his two main product lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge.</b> 4-track was the direct {{predecessor}} of the Stereo 8 cartridge, {{also known as}} the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.|$|E
25|$|RCA {{became a}} major proponent of the eight-track <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge,</b> which it {{launched}} in 1965. The eight-track cartridge initially had a huge and profitable impact on the consumer marketplace. Sales of the 8-track tape format declined when consumers increasingly favored the 4-track compact cassette tape format developed by Philips.|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, {{following}} {{four years of}} development, RCA Victor introduced the stereo, quarter-inch, reversible, reel-to-reel RCA <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge.</b> However, {{it was a large}} cassette (5" [...] × 7"), and offered few pre-recorded tapes. Despite the multiple versions, it failed.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} storage, a tape library, {{sometimes called}} a tape silo, tape robot or tape jukebox, is a storage device which contains {{one or more}} tape drives, a number of slots to hold <b>tape</b> <b>cartridges,</b> a barcode reader to identify <b>tape</b> <b>cartridges</b> and an automated method for loading tapes (a robot).|$|R
50|$|In 1999, Anacomp {{spun off}} the {{magnetic}} tape {{line of business}} as eMag Solutions. This included the Graham magnetics division. After ending 9-track magnetic tape production, Graham entered the business of recertifying <b>tape</b> <b>cartridges.</b> In 2006, the company developed a process for eradicating data from <b>tape</b> <b>cartridges</b> while preserving the servo tracks.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{always-on}} spinning {{hard disk}} drives are online storage, while spinning drives that spin down automatically, {{such as in}} massive arrays of idle disks (MAID), are nearline storage. Removable media such as <b>tape</b> <b>cartridges</b> that can be automatically loaded, as in tape libraries, are nearline storage, while <b>tape</b> <b>cartridges</b> that must be manually loaded are offline storage.|$|R
2500|$|Red Simpson {{mentions}} Haggard and Buck Owens in his 1971 song [...] "I'm a Truck," [...] {{which contains}} the line, [...] "Well, I know what he's gonna do now/Take out that <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge</b> of Buck Owens and play it again/I dunno why he don't get a Merle Haggard tape." ...|$|E
2500|$|For 1967, the 7 Litre model {{no longer}} carried the Galaxie name; {{it was to}} be the last year of it being {{separately}} identified. That identification was mainly trim such as horn ring and dashboard markings as well as the [...] "Q" [...] in the Vehicle Identification Number. The 7 Litre for 1967 was a trim and performance option on the Ford XL, which was now a separate model as well. Little else changed, except for trim and the styling; the same engines were available, from the 240 cu. inch six-cylinder to the 428 cu. inch V8. Modifications to the styling included adding a major bend {{in the center of the}} grille and making the model less [...] "boxy" [...] than the 1966 model. [...] An 8-track <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge</b> player became an option. Back-up lights were standard.|$|E
50|$|Bernard Cousino was a music {{technology}} inventor. He {{is known}} for inventing an endless loop <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge</b> design in 1952, known as the Audio Vendor, that would inspire George Eash to make the Fidelipac <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge,</b> which itself would inspire the Stereo-Pak <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some <b>tape</b> <b>cartridges,</b> notably LTO cartridges, have small, {{associated}} {{data storage}} chips {{built into the}} cartridges that record metadata about the tape, such as the type of encoding, size of the storage, dates and other information. It's also common for <b>tape</b> <b>cartridges</b> to have bar codes on their labels in order to assist an automated tape library.|$|R

50|$|The Fidelipac {{cartridge}} was {{the first}} audio <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge</b> available commercially, based on the endless-loop <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge</b> design developed by Bernard Cousino in 1952, while Eash shared space in Cousino's electronics shop in the early 1950s. Instead of manufacturing the Fidelipac format himself after developing it, Eash decided to license it for manufacture to Telepro Industries, in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Telepro then manufactured and marketed the format under the Fidelipac brand name.|$|E
50|$|The IBM AP-101 {{computers}} {{originally had}} about 424 kilobytes of magnetic core memory each. The CPU could process about 400,000 instructions per second. They had no hard disk drive, and loaded software from magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|In computing, Native {{capacity}} {{refers to}} the uncompressed storage capacity of any medium that is usually spoken of in compressed sizes. For example, <b>tape</b> <b>cartridges</b> are rated in compressed capacity, which usually assumes 2:1 compression ratio over the native capacity.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{magnetic}} tape for data storage was wound on 10.5 in reels. This {{de facto standard}} for large computer systems persisted through the late 1980s. <b>Tape</b> <b>cartridges</b> and cassettes were available {{as early as the}} mid-1970s and were frequently used with small computer systems. With the introduction of the IBM 3480 cartridge in 1984, large computer systems started to move away from open reel <b>tapes</b> and towards <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As {{hard disk}} drive prices have dropped, disk has become cheaper {{relative}} to tape drives and cartridges. [...] {{the cost of an}} LTO-5 drive taking tapes of up to 1.5 TB true (uncompressed) capacity was about US$1800. [...] a <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge</b> is still cheaper than a disk drive, as a 1.5 TB magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge</b> costs about US$40 whereas a {{hard disk drive}} with the same capacity costs about US$70 to US$100.|$|E

50|$|With two {{interleaved}} stereo pairs, {{the track}} format {{and speed of}} the RCA <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge</b> is fully compatible with the slower 3.75 IPS speed of consumer reel-to-reel stereo tape recorders. It is possible to dismantle the cartridge, spool the tape onto an open reel, and play it on such a machine. In fact, RCA offered an adapter for their Sound <b>Tape</b> <b>Cartridge</b> machines {{to enable them to}} both play back and record traditional reels of tape up to 5 inches in reel diameter.|$|E
50|$|The FOR-A LTR-100HS {{digital video}} {{recorder}} device is using IBM LTFS formatted <b>tape</b> <b>cartridges.</b> It was introduced at the NAB 2010 and won the IBC 2010 Pick Hit Awards from Broadcast Engineering.

50|$|Physical {{evidence}} exists {{suggesting that there}} may be no Birotron left at all with a complete, fully working, unmagnetized tape set. Many found tapes and 8-track <b>tape</b> <b>cartridges</b> themselves are so worn, damaged and delicate, that they exist as mere remnants more than functional parts.|$|R

50|$|To {{eliminate}} the nuisance of tape-threading, various manufacturers introduced cartridges {{that held the}} tape inside a metal or plastic housing to eliminate handling. Most were intended only for low-fidelity voice recording in dictation machines. The first <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge</b> designed for general consumer use, including music reproduction, was the Sound Tape or Magazine Loading Cartridge (RCA <b>tape</b> <b>cartridge),</b> introduced in 1958 by RCA. Prerecorded stereophonic music cartridges were available, and blank cartridges {{could be used to}} make recordings at home, but the format failed to gain popularity.|$|E

During this time, Anacomp/Graham was the world leader in open-reel {{computer}} tape production and one of 3 major manufacturers of IBM 3480 Family <b>tape</b> <b>cartridges.</b> They sold <b>tape</b> under the Graham, Memorex, and other brands.|$|R
