25|$|The CIE XYZ {{color space}} {{encompasses}} all color sensations that are visible {{to a person}} with average eyesight. That is why CIE XYZ (<b>Tristimulus</b> <b>values)</b> is a device-invariant representation of color. It serves as a standard reference against which many other color spaces are defined. A set of color-matching functions, like the spectral sensitivity curves of the LMS color space, but not restricted to non-negative sensitivities, associates physically produced light spectra with specific <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{color space}} maps {{a range of}} {{physically}} produced colors from mixed light, pigments, etc. to an objective description of color sensations registered in the human eye, typically in terms of <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values,</b> but not usually in the LMS color space defined by the spectral sensitivities of the cone cells. The <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> associated with a color space can be conceptualized as amounts of three primary colors in a tri-chromatic, additive color model. In some color spaces, including the LMS and XYZ spaces, the primary colors used are not real colors {{in the sense that}} they cannot be generated in any light spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Other observers, such {{as for the}} CIE RGB {{space or}} other RGB color spaces, are defined by other sets of three color-matching functions, and lead to <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> in those other spaces.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, if the {{reference}} white in both illuminants have the Y <b>tristimulus</b> <b>value</b> (...) then: ...|$|R
5000|$|L is a {{correlate}} of lightness, and is {{computed from}} the Y <b>tristimulus</b> <b>value</b> using Priest's approximation to Munsell value: ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{where the}} Munsell-Sloan-Godlove value {{function}} {{is applied to}} the <b>tristimulus</b> <b>value</b> indicated in the subscript. (Note that the two spaces use different lightness approximations.) ...|$|R
25|$|The CIE model capitalises on {{this fact}} by {{defining}} Y as luminance. Z is quasi-equal to blue stimulation, or the S cone response, and X {{is a mix}} (a linear combination) of cone response curves chosen to be nonnegative. The XYZ <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> are thus analogous to, but different from, the LMS cone responses of the human eye. Defining Y as luminance has the useful result that for any given Y value, the XZ plane will contain all possible chromaticities at that luminance.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{distribution}} of cones in the eye, the <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> depend on the observer's field of view. To eliminate this variable, the CIE defined a color-mapping function called the standard (colorimetric) observer, to represent an average human's chromatic response within a 2° arc inside the fovea. This angle was chosen owing {{to the belief that}} the color-sensitive cones resided within a 2° arc of the fovea. Thus the CIE 1931 Standard Observer function is also known as the CIE 1931 2° Standard Observer. A more modern but less-used alternative is the CIE 1964 10° Standard Observer, which is derived from the work of Stiles and Burch, and Speranskaya.|$|E

50|$|The CIE 1960 UCS {{does not}} define a {{luminance}} or lightness component, but the Y <b>tristimulus</b> <b>value</b> of the XYZ color space or a lightness index similar to W* of the CIE 1964 color space are sometimes used.|$|R

5000|$|Note. - Munsell's V {{runs from}} 0 to 10, while Y {{typically}} runs from 0 to 100 (often {{interpreted as a}} percentage). Typically, the relative luminance is normalized so that the [...] "reference white" [...] (say, magnesium oxide) has a <b>tristimulus</b> <b>value</b> of Y = 100. Since the reflectance of magnesium oxide (MgO) relative to the perfect reflecting diffuser is 97.5%, V = 10 corresponds to Y = 100/97.5% ≈ 102.6 if MgO is used as the reference.|$|R

Pauli removes this restriction by computing a linear extrapolation which maps Y/Yn = 0 to L* = 0 and is tangent to the formula above at {{the point at which the}} linear extension takes effect. First, the transition point is determined to be Y/Yn = (6/29)^3 ≈ 0.008,856, then the slope of (29/3)^3 ≈ 903.3 is computed. This gives the two-part function: ...|$|R
2500|$|Most {{wavelengths}} stimulate two or {{all three}} kinds of cone cell because the spectral sensitivity curves of the three kinds overlap. Certain <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> are thus physically impossible, for example LMS <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> that are non-zero for the M component and zero for both the L and S components. Furthermore, LMS <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values</b> for pure spectral colors would, in any normal trichromatic additive color space, e. g. the RGB color spaces, imply negative values {{for at least one}} of the three primaries because the chromaticity would be outside the color triangle defined by the primary colors. To avoid these negative RGB values, and to have one component that describes the perceived brightness, [...] "imaginary" [...] primary colors and corresponding color-matching functions were formulated. The CIE 1931 color space defines the resulting <b>tristimulus</b> <b>values,</b> in which they are denoted by [...] "X", [...] "Y", and [...] "Z". In XYZ space, all combinations of non-negative coordinates are meaningful, but many, such as the primary locations , , and , correspond to imaginary colors outside the space of possible LMS coordinates; imaginary colors do not correspond to any spectral distribution of wavelengths and therefore have no physical reality.|$|E

40|$|Photobleaching of aged {{traditional}} Japanese {{paper that}} has been thermally yellowed during storage for 200 years was examined {{from the standpoint of}} accumulated light radiation dosage in a museum environment. The light intensity was evaluated using a blue wool reference of the Japan Industrial Standards (JIS) as a dosimeter. The wavelength sensitivity of the photobleaching was compiled under monochromatic light radiation. Color changes in the specimens were measured in <b>tristimuli</b> <b>values</b> in color. by using a color analyzer. The aged pieces of paper were monitored continuously as they were photobleached under three different lighting conditions in a museum environment for 8000 h. The combination of the yellowness index changes of the aged pieces of paper and the color changes of a blue wool reference was interpreted as follows. Photobleaching was governed by accumulated light intensities and was independant upon daily lighting conditions. The wavelength sensitivity of the photobleaching of aged paper showed that the maximum effect occurred at 420 nm in the visible light range. The blue wool reference was confirmed to perform well as a dosimeter...|$|R

40|$|Multispectral imaging is {{significant}} {{technology for the}} acquisition and display of accurate color information. Natural color reproduction under arbitrary illumination becomes possible using spectral information of both image and illumination light. In addition, multiprimary color display, i. e., using more than three primary colors, has been also developed for the reproduction of expanded color gamut, and for discounting observer metamerism. In this paper, we present the concept for the multispectral data interchange for natural color reproduction, and the experimental results using 16 -band multispectral camera and 6 -primary color display. In the experiment, the accuracy of color reproduction is evaluated in CIE ∆Ea*b * for both image capture and display systems. The average and maximum ∆Ea*b * = 1. 0 and 2. 1 in 16 -band mutispectral camera system, using Macbeth 24 color patches. In the six-primary color projection display, average and maximum ∆Ea*b * = 1. 3 and 2. 7 with 30 test colors inside the display gamut. Moreover, the color reproduction results with different spectral distributions but same CIE <b>tristimulus</b> <b>value</b> are visually compared, and {{it is confirmed that}} the 6 -primary display gives improved agreement between the original and reproduced colors...|$|R
40|$|A {{most common}} problem {{encountered}} in radiosterilization of solid drugs is discoloration or yellowing. By pharmacopoeia method, discoloration {{can be assessed}} by measuring absorbance of solutions of irradiated solid samples at 450  nm. We propose to evaluate discoloration of solid samples directly by recording their diffuse reflectance spectra. Further, the reflectance spectrum is used to compute various color parameters: CIE XYZ <b>tristimulus</b> <b>value,</b> CIE Lab, Δ E_ab^ * (color difference), yellowness index (YI), dominant wavelength, and excitation purity by CIE method. The investigation of difference reflectance spectra and color parameters revealed that for fluoroquinolones, e-beam was more damaging than gamma radiation, whereas for cephalosporins, trend was reversed. The quantum of discoloration with gamma radiation and e-beam {{is found to be}} nearly equal when assessed by pharmacopeia method, and it is therefore inadequate to assess small color differences. The color parameters Δ E_ab^ * and ΔYI are found to be reliable indicators of discoloration. The tolerance limits proposed in terms of /Delta E_ab^ * and ΔYI are ± 2 and ± 10  U, respectively. The dominant wavelength for all compounds has shifted to higher values indicating change in hue but defining color tolerance limit with this parameter requires adjunct excitation purity value...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the influence of pH on the color development of melanoidins formed from amino acid enantiomer model systems. For this, the color development was evaluated by measuring browning at 420 nm and color measurements by spectrophotometry and colorimetry. The browning and browning index showed no difference according {{to the type of}} amino acid enantiomers, while that formed from the D-Asn system was the only difference according to pH level. The <b>tristimulus</b> <b>value</b> of melanoidins formed from all model systems was located on a dominant wavelength of 475 nm, the blue zone of the diagram. In addition, the L*, a*, b*, C*ab values, and ΔE * index {{on the basis of the}} type of amino acid enantiomers, the differences were markedly found at pH 4. 0. At pH 7. 0, significantly differences were found in the L*, a*, b * values, and ΔE * index and not in the case of the lysine enantiomers. In addition, at pH 10. 0, the differences were found in the a * and b * values from the lysine enantiomers and C*ab value from the asparagine enantiomers. Therefore, the color development of melanoidins was influenced by the type of amino acid enantiomers and pH levels. Especially, it is thought that the a * and b * values can be used to explain the differences among the amino acid enantiomers in the color development of melanoidins...|$|R

30|$|Because of {{the complex}} color-forming process, the shade, lightness, and {{distribution}} of jadeite-jade green are not as uniform as a single crystal gem with an optical homogeneity, show the polychromatism caused by the heterogeneity of crystal optics, or reveal the color zonal distribution formed with different grow stages. Therefore, based on the calculation of jadeite-jade <b>tristimulus</b> <b>value</b> under different spectral power distribution [4, 5], the quality evaluation of jadeite-jade green is influenced not only by its own characteristics but also by its transparency and shape. At the same time, the color of non-spontaneous optical objects is affected by external lighting conditions, such as the color temperature, illuminance, and color rendering of the light source, and the observer, then the color appearance, is not only different with the color temperature [6, 7], {{there will also be}} a significant change in illumination [8 – 11], and it can lead to the international popular research on the color prediction of non-spontaneous optical objects [12 – 14]. Similar to the color grading system of other materials [15], the color temperature of lighting source must in the scope of 4500 – 5500 K and color rendering index must not be lower than 90, which is claimed in the China National Standards (CNS) GB/T 23885 - 2009 of Jadeite-Jade Grading [16]. Of course, the complexity of on-spontaneous light objects’ color appearance under heterogeneous illumination reveals that an inversion relationship is clarified between lightness and brightness and also between chroma and colorfulness under nonuniform illumination with different illuminance levels (high and low) within the same visual field [17]; this is impossible under uniform lighting condition.|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} sexual {{selection}} {{has proven to}} be an important factor in understanding the mechanisms behind the evolution of secondary sexual traits. The Hamilton and Zuk (1982) hypothesis of parasite-mediated sexual selection postulates that birds evolved ornamentation to indicate parasite resistance to potential mates. My research explores the relationship between parasite load and plumage coloration in hunter-harvested mourning doves. Plumage from seven body areas was collected, ectoparasites were quantified and blood smears made so that intracellular hematozoan parasites could be quantified. Tarsometatarsi were measured, and the testes of males were collected to determine any effects of parasite load on them. Plumage was subject to UV-vis photospectroscopy to determine the <b>tristimulus</b> color <b>values</b> of brightness, chroma, and hue. The results of this research indicate that blood parasites and ectoparasites affect plumage brightness, chroma and hue, but the effects are inconsistent across plumage locations and color values. From this, it can be concluded that hematozoan parasites and ectoparasites do not fully explain variations found in plumage coloration in mourning doves. This means that other factors, such as gut parasites, nutritional condition, and age must be considered as additional potential sources of plumage variation. My project lays the groundwork for future research into the causes of plumage color variation in mourning doves...|$|R
