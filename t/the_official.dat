5|$|In {{the game}} of baseball, <b>the</b> <b>official</b> scorer is a person {{appointed}} by the league to record the events on the field, and to send <b>the</b> <b>official</b> scoring record of the game back to the league offices. In addition to recording the events on the field such as the outcome of each plate appearance and the circumstances of any baserunner's advance around the bases, <b>the</b> <b>official</b> scorer is also charged with making judgment calls that do not affect the progress or outcome of the game. Judgment calls are primarily made about errors, unearned runs, fielder's choice, the value of hits in certain situations, and wild pitches, {{all of which are}} included in the record compiled. This record is used to compile statistics for each player and team. A box score is a summary of <b>the</b> <b>official</b> scorer's game record.|$|E
5|$|Most {{plays in}} the game are {{resolved}} {{in such a way}} that the scorer is not given more than one choice when recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>official</b> scorer. In any difficult judgment call where <b>the</b> <b>official</b> scorer is required to decide whether to credit a hit to the batter, the scorer is guided by rule 10.05. This rule directs <b>the</b> <b>official</b> scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the hitter when the scorer believes that the decision to credit the batter with a hit is equally valid to an alternative scoring decision. In a similarly difficult judgment call where <b>the</b> <b>official</b> scorer believes that an earned run or an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 directs <b>the</b> <b>official</b> scorer to give the benefit of the doubt to the pitcher.|$|E
