What is less well-known is whether this <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> persists into late life. This literature review examines whether <b>the</b> well-known <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in unipolar depression continues into old age, and, if it does, whether the variables that are known to contribute to <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in unipolar depression from adolescence through adulthood continue to contribute to <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in <b>the</b> elderly, and/or whether there are new variables that arise in old age and contribute to <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in <b>the</b> elderly.

40|$|This paper explores <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in smoking using {{information}} on 15, 277 adults {{obtained from the}} Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys of 2001 and 2005. Applying a decomposition approach extended from the Oaxaca-Blinder method, we obtained factors influencing <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in smoking and estimated their separate contributions. According to the outcomes of decomposition analyses, <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in smoking-tendency (or inclination to smoke) accounted for 98 % of <b>the</b> total <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in smoking. When <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in smoking was decomposed into specified factors, the difference in smoking-tendency between married men and women {{was found to be}} the most crucial factor as it explained 11 % of <b>the</b> total <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in smoking. <b>The</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in <b>the</b> proportion of persons attaining a low level of education contributed to a 6 % reduction of <b>the</b> total <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in smoking. Additionally, factors influencing the gender-specific smoking-tendency were found to be important in explaining <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in smoking. We conclude that, understanding separate contributions of sets of factors affecting <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in smoking and devising appropriate policies could effectively reduce the smoking rate of a target <b>gender</b> group to <b>the</b> level of that of a reference gender group.

There is also evidence for a negative recall bias in women, which means females in general are more likely than males to recall their mistakes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In recent years, {{there was}} an {{increased}} interest in investigating <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in performance {{and the age of}} peak performance in ultra-endurance performances such as ultra-triathlon, ultra-running, and ultra-swimming, but not in ultra-cycling. The aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in ultra-cycling performance and the age of peak ultra-cycling performance in the 720 -km 'Swiss Cycling Marathon', the largest European qualifier for the 'Race Across America'. METHODS: Changes in the cycling speed and age of 985 finishers including 38 women and 947 men competing in the Swiss Cycling Marathon from 2001 to 2012 covering a distance of 720 km with a change of altitude of 4, 993 m were analyzed using linear regression. RESULTS: <b>The</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in performance was 13. 6 % for the fastest cyclists ever, 13. 9 % ± 0. 5 % for the three fastest cyclists ever and 19. 1 % ± 3. 7 % for the ten fastest cyclists ever. <b>The</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in performance for the annual top three women and men decreased from 35. 0 % ± 9. 5 % in 2001 to 20. 4 % ± 7. 7 % in 2012 (r 2 = 0. 72, p = 0. 01). The annual top three women improved cycling speed from 20. 3 ± 3. 1 km h- 1 in 2003 to 24. 8 ± 2. 4 km h- 1 in 2012 (r 2 = 0. 79, p 0. 05). The age of peak performance for the ten fastest finishers ever was 35. 9 ± 9. 6 years for men and 38. 7 ± 7. 8 years for women, respectively (p = 0. 47). CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in ultra-cycling performance decreased over the 2001 to 2012 period in the 720 -km Swiss Cycling Marathon for the annual top three cyclists and reached approximately 14 %. Both women and men achieved peak performance at the age of approximately 36 to 39 years. Women might close <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> gap in ultra-endurance cycling in longer cycling distances.

40|$|This {{comparative}} study examines cross-national variation in <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in primary and specialized {{mental health care}} use in Europe. We investigate to what extent socioeconomic, family-related, and mental health factors explain <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference,</b> and how <b>the</b> impact of these groups of determinants on <b>gender</b> <b>differences</b> in mental health care use varies between countries. Data from the Eurobarometer 248 (2005 - 2006) for 29 European countries is used and country-specific logistic regression analyses are performed. <b>Gender</b> <b>differences</b> in professional care seeking are largely need based. In almost one-third of the countries examined, <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> is mainly attributable to women's poorer mental health status. However, in some countries, family and socioeconomic characteristics also have an independent contribution to <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in mental health care use. Women's higher likelihood of a lower socioeconomic position, might partly explain their higher primary care use, while in some countries, it restricts their specialized care use. In addition, some social conditions, as having children and being widowed, seem to function in a few countries as suppressors of women's care use. Our study has shown that <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in mental health care use, with women having a higher care use, is not a consistent European phenomenon and {{is dependent on the}} type of care provider, with greater <b>gender</b> inequity in <b>the</b> use of primary health care.

BACKGROUNDType 1 diabetes abolishes <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in coronary heart disease mortality because it {{is associated with a}} greater elevation of coronary disease risk in women than men. The pathophysiological basis of this is not understood. METHODSCoronary artery calcification and coronary risk factors were compared in 199 type 1 diabetic patients and 201 nondiabetic participants of similar age (30 to 55 years) and gender (50 % female) distribution. Only one subject had a history of coronary disease. Calcification was measured with electron beam computed tomography. RESULTSIn nondiabetic participants there was a large <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in calcification prevalence (men 54 %, women 21 %, odds ratio 4. 5, p < 0. 001), half of which was explained by established risk factors (odds ratio after adjustment = 2. 2). Diabetes was associated with a greatly increased prevalence of calcification in women (47 %), but not men (52 %), so that <b>the</b> <b>gender</b> <b>difference</b> in calcification was lost (p = 0. 002 for the greater effect of diabetes on calcification in women than men). On adjustment for risk factors, diabetes remained associated with a threefold higher odds ratio of calcification in women than men (p = 0. 02).
