5|$|Tantalum is {{estimated}} to make up about 1ppm or 2ppm of the Earth's crust by weight. There are many species of tantalum minerals, only {{some of which are}} so far being used by industry as raw materials: tantalite, microlite, wodginite, euxenite, polycrase. Tantalite (Fe, Mn)Ta2O6 is the most important mineral for tantalum extraction. Tantalite has the same mineral structure as columbite (Fe, Mn) (Ta, Nb)2O6; when there is more tantalum than niobium it is called tantalite and when there is more niobium than tantalum is it called columbite (or niobite). The high density of tantalite and other tantalum containing minerals makes the use of gravitational separation <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>method.</b> Other minerals include samarskite and fergusonite.|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>method</b> of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Johnson taught {{part-time}} at the Nottingham School of Art, {{and managed}} to have Knight enrolled as an 'artisan student' there, paying no fees, aged just 13. At the age of fifteen, and still a student herself, Knight took over her mother's teaching duties when Charlotte {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and became seriously ill. Later Knight won a scholarship and the gold medal in the national student competition held by the then South Kensington Museum. She continued to give private lessons after she left the School of Art, as both she and her sister Evangeline Agnes, known as Sissie, had been left to live alone on very little money, after the deaths of their mother, their sister Nellie and both their grandmothers. At the School of Art, Laura met {{one of the most promising}} students, Harold Knight, then aged 17, and determined that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>method</b> of learning was to copy Harold's technique.

5|$|He {{originally}} recorded Lagos for his use in-studio, {{but when}} presented {{with the idea of}} sharing the sound for artistic installation, he began to edit the clips for their best representation of Lagos and considered <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>method</b> of public dissemination. Home from his Egyptian art program, Ogboh was inspired to create the Lagos Soundscapes project when the artist was able to identify the sounds of his city during a phone call with a friend. As he transitioned to the field, he turned to online help in discussion forums and email. In his installations, Ogboh prefers audio that requires minimal studio manipulation, and does not significantly alter the sounds. Some audio effects come from the recording environment, both surfaces that echo and distort sound, and the effect of traveling with a recorder. His first sound installation was in the Fayoum academy's bathroom, followed by his first Lagos Soundscapes installation at the Lagos African Artists' Foundation in 2009. Ogboh remembered reception mostly around his work's novelty.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the political unrest in Saigon, the Communist leadership in North Vietnam were far {{more concerned about the}} best strategy to fight the South Vietnamese government and their American supporters. While all leaders in Hanoi shared the same goal of eventual reunification of their homeland, different factions within the Communist Party disagreed on <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>method</b> to achieve their desired goal. Members of North Vietnam's Politburo were divided by the issues surrounding the Soviet strategy of peaceful co-existence versus the Chinese strategy of supporting national liberation movements in emerging countries. Despite their differences of opinion, the Communist Party leadership ultimately made preparations for armed struggle in South Vietnam. From Hanoi's perspective, the military regime in Saigon was able to hold out because the Communist main forces were still not ready to fight a conventional war, so North Vietnam must focus on the development of its military force in the shortest period of time. In the meantime, however, the war must be kept at its current level in order to prevent the full involvement of the United States military.|$|E
5|$|In early 1810, as the cyclone season {{came to an}} end, Hamelin {{ordered a}} {{squadron}} of frigates under Captain Guy-Victor Duperré to attack British convoys in the Bay of Bengal. Duperré was initially unsuccessful, but after sailing to Madagascar for a brief refit he encountered and defeated a convoy in the Action of 3 July 1810. The British response to the French depredations was already in progress: in late June, Rowley sailed with two frigates to Rodriguez, leaving Captain Samuel Pym off Isle de France with the remainder. On Rodriguez, Rowley and Lieutenant Colonel Henry Keating conferred on <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>method</b> of invading and rapidly subduing the island, determining that the best plan was to land soldiers {{either side of the}} island's capital Saint Denis and defeat the garrison outside the town, forcing the new governor to surrender.|$|E

5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Richard Abels, P. Grosjean, and Alan Thacker, {{state that}} Deusdedit died on 14 July 664. The main argument was {{put forward by}} Grosjean, who claimed that Bede had the consecration date wrong, as 26 May was Maundy Thursday in 655, not a date that would normally have been chosen for a consecration. Grosjean argues that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>method</b> for resolving the conflicts is to just take 14July 664 as the date of death, and figure backwards with the length of reign given by Bede, which gives a consecration date of 12March 655. Thacker and Abels agree generally, although Thacker does not give a specific consecration date beyond March. Abels adds to Grosjean's arguments Bede's association of Deusdedit's death with that of King Eorcenberht, which Bede gives as occurring on the same day. Bede states that the plague of 664 began soon after the eclipse on 1May. Nothing in Bede contradicts the date of 14July 664 for Eorcenberht; therefore, Abels considers that date {{to be the best}} fit for the available data. The historian D. P. Kirby agrees that Deusdedit died in 664, although he does not give a precise date within that year.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>method</b> for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E
5|$|Questions then arose {{among the}} U.S. {{administration}} and military leadership as to <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>method</b> by which Hanoi (the perceived locus of the insurgency) could be dissuaded from its course of action. The answer seemed {{to lie in}} the application of air power. By 1964 most of the civilians surrounding President Lyndon B. Johnson shared the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collective faith in the efficacy of strategic bombing to one degree or another. They reasoned that a small nation like North Vietnam, with a tiny industrial base that was just emerging after the First Indochina War, would be reluctant to risk its new-found economic viability to support the insurgency in the south. Constantly affecting this decision-making process were fears of possible counter moves or outright intervention by the Soviet Union, the PRC, or both. The civilians and the military were divided, however, on the manner of affecting Hanoi's will to support the southern insurgency. The civilians thought in terms of changing the regime's behavior while the military men were more concerned with breaking its will.|$|E
