5|$|My {{interpretation}} {{is that she}} isn’t {{trying to keep the}} secret. That she doesn’t care. She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but really, if anyone figured it out and asked her, she’d just probably be like “Yeah, shut up!” or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self-involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing in}} the minors, Crozier adopted the {{butterfly}} style of goaltending, which he would later use during his NHL career. This technique was popularized by Glenn Hall and was improved upon by Crozier. Initially, his minor league coaches tried to convince him to abandon this style, thinking <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> succeed in the NHL. Crozier also added an element of acrobacy in his game.|$|E
5|$|Similarly {{they decided}} that the United Kingdom could not {{exercise}} any judicial power over Australia, {{with the end of}} appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and the court's previous decision, in Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 2) that the limited purpose of a certificate of appeal, was spent and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again grant a certificate of appeal. They also decided that no executive power existed over Australia, as although the sovereign monarch of Australia and the sovereign monarch of the United Kingdom are the same person, it had been accepted {{for a long time that}} the monarch acts in Australian matters on the advice of Australian ministers, and does not accept the advice of United Kingdom ministers in Australian matters at all.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>it</b> so chanced <b>that</b> I was {{thinking}} of her at <b>that</b> moment. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have done to say this, so I stammered. And Miss Thorn {{was a young woman}} of tact.|$|R

60|$|He {{stared at}} her in white astonishment. He fell behind her one step, {{and then in a}} stride came level again. Then, a silence, a silence <b>that</b> seemed <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> end. She had stopped crying, she was one huge suspense, not daring even to look at his face.

5|$|Ireland was {{important}} to Henry, both {{as a source of}} royal revenue – an average of £1,150 was sent from Ireland to the Crown each year during the middle of his reign – and as a source of estates that could be granted to his supporters. The major landowners looked eastwards towards Henry's court for political leadership, and many also possessed estates in Wales and England. The 1240s saw major upheavals in land ownership due to deaths among the barons, enabling Henry to redistribute Irish lands to his supporters. In the 1250s, the King gave out numerous grants of land along the frontier in Ireland to his supporters, creating a buffer zone against the native Irish; the local Irish kings began to suffer increased harassment as English power increased across the region. These lands were in many cases unprofitable for the barons to hold and English power reached its zenith under Henry for the medieval period. In 1254, Henry granted Ireland to his son, Edward, on condition <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be separated from the Crown.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of The Castle of Cagliostro, Miyazaki began working on his ideas for an {{animated}} film adaptation of Richard Corben's comic book Rowlf and pitched the idea to Yutaka Fujioka at TMS. In November 1980, a proposal was drawn up to acquire the film rights. Around that time, Miyazaki was also approached {{for a series of}} magazine articles by the editorial staff of Animage. During subsequent conversations, he showed his sketchbooks and discussed basic outlines for envisioned animation projects with editors Toshio Suzuki and Osamu Kameyama, who saw the potential for collaboration on their development into animation. Two projects were proposed: , to be set in the Sengoku period; and the adaptation of Corben's Rowlf. Both were rejected, as the company was unwilling to fund anime projects not based on existing manga, and the rights for the adaptation of Rowlf could not be secured. An agreement was reached that Miyazaki could start developing his sketches and ideas into a manga for the magazine with the proviso <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be made into a film. The manga—titled Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind—ran from February 1982 to March 1994. The story, as re-printed in the tankōbon volumes, spans seven volumes for a combined total of 1060 pages. Miyazaki drew the episodes primarily in pencil, and it was printed monochrome in sepia toned ink. Miyazaki resigned from Telecom Animation Film in November 1982.|$|E

25|$|The {{scheme was}} devised by C. Y. O'Connor who oversaw its design {{and most of}} the {{construction}} project. Although supported by Premier Forrest, O'Connor had to deal with widespread criticism and derision from members of the Western Australian Parliament as well as the local press based on a belief that the scope of the engineering task was too great and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> work.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Beetham {{was posted}} to the Air Ministry's Operational Requirements Branch. Much {{of his time}} was taken up with the {{problems}} of bringing the V-bombers into service. Notably, Beetham also drafted the first specification for the TSR 2. Beetham's next appointment was as the Personal Staff Officer to Task Force Commander of Operation Buffalo in 1956. The open-air nuclear test explosions witnessed by Beetham led him to the view <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be possible to limit the extent of a nuclear war.|$|E
25|$|Entire news {{organizations}} {{have not been}} immune to press restrictions concerning Falun Gong. In March 2001, Time Asia ran a story about Falun Gong in Hong Kong. The magazine was pulled from the shelves in Mainland China, and threatened <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again be sold in the country. Partly {{as a result of}} the difficult reporting environment, by 2002, Western news coverage of the persecution within China had all but completely ceased, even as the number of Falun Gong deaths in custody was on the rise.|$|E
5000|$|Chinook Pass {{was chosen}} as a route across the Cascade Mountains as a compromise.

50|$|The {{motion to}} revoke Boston-Maine's DOT air carrier {{certificate}} was {{brought by the}} Air Line Pilots Association. DOT specifically cited the numerous instances where the airline's officials had failed to follow federal laws and regulations and had filed false financial data with the Department in its application for authority to fly large aircraft. The DOT concluded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>never</b> granted the large aircraft authority had it known of the false information filed by Boston-Maine.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{it being}} {{increasingly}} {{clear to the}} organizers of the project <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be finished in time {{to make a difference in}} the war, the construction of Weingut I was approved on a 6-month time-line. Of a total of 10,000 workers who worked on the project, 8,500 were forced laborers and inmates of the Mühldorf concentration camp network. Of these more than 3,000 would die of overwork, underfeeding, and SS brutality. By the war's end, only 7 of the planned total of 12 bunker sections had been built, and construction of the factory itself had not begun.|$|E
25|$|On 6 December 2003, Bartlett {{stepped aside}} {{temporarily}} {{as leader of}} the party, after an incident in which he swore at Liberal Senator Jeannie Ferris on the floor of Parliament while intoxicated. The party issued a statement stating that deputy leader Lyn Allison would serve as the acting leader of the party. Bartlett apologised to the Democrats, Jeannie Ferris and the Australian public for his behaviour and assured all concerned <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> happen again. On 29 January 2004, after seeking medical treatment, Bartlett returned to the Australian Democrats leadership, vowing to abstain from alcohol.|$|E
25|$|From an {{exploration}} point of view, Forrest's third expedition was of great importance. A large area of previously unknown land was explored, {{and the popular}} notion of an inland sea was shown to be unlikely. However, the practical results were not great. Plenty of good pastoral land was found up {{to the head of}} the Murchison, but beyond that, the land was useless for pastoral enterprise, and Forrest was convinced <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be settled. Forrest also made botanical collections during the expedition that were given to Ferdinand von Mueller, who, in turn, named Eremophila forrestii in his honour.|$|E

25|$|On November 2011 Air Tanzania had leased a Fokker F28 {{aircraft}} from JetLink Express on a standby {{basis in}} case its only operational aircraft is incapacitated. The airline assured the public <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> cease operations again {{and that more}} aircraft would be procured {{over the next several}} months and years, according to the airline's business plan shared with the media. On 21 November 2011, Air Tanzania began negotiations with Export Development Canada (EDC) to explore how EDC could assist the airline to acquire more aircraft from Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft manufacturer. Those negotiations, however, failed due to the large debt the airline had.|$|E
25|$|Logistical {{arrangements}} in Wellington's army collapsed and the Allied soldiers marched in cold pouring rain {{for four days}} with very little food. Soult only sent his cavalry after the Allies. Even so, the French horsemen scooped up hundreds of stragglers. On 16 November, 600 Allied soldiers were captured by the French. The number of prisoners was even higher on the 17th and included Wellington's second-in-command, General Edward Paget. Before reaching the friendly fortress of Ciudad Rodrigo, the Allied armies lost 5,000 men missing, mostly soldiers who had died from hunger or exposure in the chaotic retreat. It appeared that all of Wellington's efforts in 1812 had been for nothing. Yet, his Anglo-Portuguese army had gained a moral ascendancy over the French <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> relinquish.|$|E
25|$|Section 74 of the Constitution, as {{enacted by}} the Imperial Parliament, {{prohibited}} appeals on constitutional matters involving disputes about the limits inter se of Commonwealth or state powers, except where the High Court certified it was appropriate for the appeal {{to be determined by}} the Privy Council. It did so only once: in the 1912 case of Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v Attorney-General (Cth) when the Court was equally divided. After that case, in which the Privy Council refused to answer the constitutional questions put to it, the High Court never certified another inter se appeal. Indeed, in the case of Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (1985), the court said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again grant a certificate of appeal.|$|E

25|$|By late 1956, {{the decline}} of the American {{merchant}} marine, budget problems in New York City, the expense of maintaining, repairing, and operating John W. Brown, and the cost of busing students between the schools main building and the ship had created financial difficulties for the high school <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> fully overcome. New York City officials gave thought to ending the maritime vocational training program and closing the school, but cost-cutting measures were instituted, such as returning in September 1957 to the schedule of having students study in the schools building for a week at time and aboard ship for a week at time, eliminating the expense of busing. However, continuing budget problems finally led to the school closing in mid-1982, and John W. Brown remained idle in New York Harbor for the next year.|$|E
25|$|Prescott had {{a stormy}} {{relationship}} with the privatisation of the railway industry. He had vigorously opposed the privatisation of the industry while the Labour Party was in opposition, and disliked the party's policy, established in 1996 just before the flotation of Railtrack on the London Stock Exchange, of committing to renationalise the industry only when resources allowed, which he saw as meaning <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be done. Reluctantly, he supported the alternative policy, produced by then shadow transport secretary Clare Short, that the industry should be subjected to closer regulation by the to-be-created Strategic Rail Authority (in {{the case of the}} passenger train operators) and the Rail Regulator (in the case of the monopoly and dominant elements in the industry, principally Railtrack). The policy was spelled out in some detail in the Labour Party's statement in the June 1996 prospectus for the sale of Railtrack shares, and was widely regarded as having depressed the price of the shares.|$|E
25|$|By {{separating}} Aleppo from Damascus, Gouraud {{wanted to}} capitalize on a traditional state of competition between the two cities {{and turn it into}} political division. The people in Aleppo were unhappy with the fact that Damascus was chosen as capital for the new nation of Syria. Gouraud sensed this sentiment and tried to manipulate it by making Aleppo the capital of a large and wealthier state with which it would have been hard for Damascus to compete. The State of Aleppo as drawn by France contained most of the fertile area of Syria: the fertile countryside of Aleppo in addition to the entire fertile basin of river Euphrates. The state also had access to sea via the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta. On the other hand, Damascus, which is basically an oasis on the fringes of the Syrian Desert, had neither enough fertile land nor access to sea. Basically, Gouraud wanted to lure Aleppo by giving it control over most of the agricultural and mineral wealth of Syria so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> want to unite with Damascus again.|$|E
