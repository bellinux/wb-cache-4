5|$|Hubble {{has helped}} resolve some long-standing {{problems}} in astronomy, {{as well as}} raising new questions. Some results have required new theories to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain {{the value of the}} Hubble constant, <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rate at which the universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of the Hubble constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques. The estimated age is now about 13.7 billion years, but before the Hubble Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.|$|E

25|$|A reaction's cross section, denoted σ, is <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{probability}} that a fusion reaction will happen.

25|$|In measure theory, the Lebesgue measure, {{named after}} French {{mathematician}} Henri Lebesgue, {{is the standard}} way of assigning a measure to subsets of n-dimensional Euclidean space. For n = 1, 2, or 3, it coincides with the standard measure of length, area, or volume. In general, it is also called n-dimensional volume, n-volume, or simply volume. It is used throughout real analysis, in particular to define Lebesgue integration. Sets that can be assigned a Lebesgue measure are called Lebesgue measurable; <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lebesgue measurable set A is denoted by λ(A).|$|E

25|$|The {{modulation}} index {{riding on the}} receive signal {{is proportional to the}} time delay between the radar and the reflector.

That distance can be displayed on an instrument, and it may also be available via the transponder. This signal processing is similar to that used in speed detecting Doppler radar.

The terms national deficit and national surplus usually refer to the federal government budget balance from year to year, not the cumulative total. A deficit year increases the debt because more money is spent than is received; a surplus year decreases the debt because more money is received than spent.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} analyser characteristics. The mass resolving power is <b>the</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ability to distinguish two peaks of slightly different m/z. The mass accuracy is {{the ratio of}} the m/z measurement error to the true m/z. Mass accuracy is usually measured in ppm or milli mass units. The mass range is the range of m/z amenable to analysis by a given analyzer. The linear dynamic range is the range over which ion signal is linear with analyte concentration. Speed refers to the time frame of the experiment and ultimately is used to determine the number of spectra per unit time that can be generated.|$|E
