5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn {{will be remembered as}} a champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E
500|$|Critic Grace Dent has likened Dot and Jim to [...] Coronation Streets Hilda and Stan Ogden, {{comparing}} a {{scene in}} EastEnders where Dot nags Jim and he prays for a quiet life to a similar one from Coronation Street, that aired decades before. Brown discussed Dot's relationship with Jim in 2004: [...] "Initially, Jim wasn't {{the sort of person}} that Dot approved of. He drank, he gambled, he lied– he wasn't reliable at all. But Jim decided that he quite fancied Dot– heaven knows why! I think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> have to work out for yourself how you can make the character work in a new situation. I could see that Jim was kind to Dot [...] His kindness drew her towards him. [...] Dot's definitely in control of Jim. She quite enjoys bossing him around." [...] Brown stated that she enjoys her screen partnership with John Bardon, saying [...] "We work very well together– he's got great timing and he can be very tender too." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{hospital}} corpsman and sniper of a four-man reconnaissance {{and surveillance}} team, SEAL Team 10. Wahlberg {{was the first}} actor to sign on as a star of the film during its early stages of development. He agreed to portray Luttrell after reading Peter Berg's script. Wahlberg chose not to read Luttrell's book Lone Survivor during production to avoid arguments with Berg over events and details that were {{left out in the}} book. [...] "The problem when adapting a piece of material like that is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> feel like something is missing", he explained. [...] "I wanted to come at it from this perspective." [...] Of Wahlberg's portrayal, Luttrell stated, [...] "Wahlberg is a consummate professional, and he's a great actor. It was a little strange watching somebody trying to play me, but we talked about it and I knew it would turn out great. I was more worried about the other guys because they’re not around to speak for themselves." [...] Wahlberg has since cited Lone Survivor as his favorite film role as an actor and producer: [...] "This is the best working experience I’ve ever had, under the toughest conditions. I remember early on as an actor, you worked a long, hard day, but you did something you felt was special, and that car ride home you couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had that feeling every day on this movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|Folklorist Sabina Magliocco {{supported}} this idea, noting {{that a great}} many of those Californian Pagans whom she interviewed claimed that they had been greatly interested in mythology and folklore as children, imagining a world of [...] "enchanted nature and magical transformations, filled with lords and ladies, witches and wizards, and humble but often wise peasants". Magliocco noted that it was this world that pagans [...] "strive to re-create in some measure". Further support for Adler's idea came from American Wiccan priestess Judy Harrow, who noted that among her comrades, there was a feeling that [...] "you don't become pagan, you discover <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> were". They have also been supported by Pagan studies scholar Graham Harvey.|$|E
2500|$|Production on K.I.S.S. was {{primarily}} handled by local Cleveland native producer Young Yonny with additional contributions from Japanese musicians Jeff Miyahara and Daisuke Imai, Chuck Harmony and longtime collaborators Carvin & Ivan. As always {{and just as}} she did before with her last 3 independently—released projects, Mýa took full creative control of the album. Harrison lent {{a hand in the}} songwriting process; co-writing several of the album's tracks with many different artists and songwriters and served as executive producer to the project. Guest features included Miami rapper Trina, international recording artist Iyaz, reggae star Sean Paul and ex Immature frontman Marques Houston. The album is a representation of Mýa's life today. [...] "It's about being cool and drama-free. And everything I do reflects that," [...] she said in a recent interview. [...] "The people that I associate with, the circle that I keep is real simple and sometimes we think or we're trained to believe <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> have to have more, more, more to make ourselves feel happy or beautiful, but it's the other way around for me. Simplicity is sexy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, I said, the twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E

2500|$|TouchArcade {{noted that}} VA-11 HALL-A {{also has a}} more [...] "salacious side", due to the {{presence}} of sexually suggestive character interactions that was present in the game's demo. In an interview between Ortiz and Siliconera, Ortiz said that the game also has [...] "waifu" [...] elements, inspired by the [...] "classic otaku getting strongly attached to a character"; the developers sought to recreate these relationships through characterization and not so much through looks, though there are [...] "a fair share of beautiful people." [...] In another interview between Christopher Oritz and Kill Screen, Ortiz remarked how [...] "this game is all about exploring what's up with the characters <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> see in the background who are never fleshed out [...] ", and due to this, the characters were designed to be average non-heroes; Jill, for example, was described by Ortiz as the cliche [...] "bartender who’s always there in the background" [...] as opposed to a [...] "hero" [...] who is always at [...] "the center of the universe, with everyone else with a supporting role." [...] Adding that [...] "you can see it as early as the premise: [...] not a hero, but the bartender", Ortiz further explains that all the game's characters, from the [...] " [...] staples like mercenaries and hackers" [...] to [...] "common folk like veterinarians, journalists, or couriers", were deliberately made to be everyday [...] "people, each with their opinion and lives", making them relatable to the player despite the futuristic setting. To help with this relatability, many of the characters and subplots in VA-11 HALL-A were based on the experiences of the developers themselves or people they know, since [...] "We want the characters to feel as real as possible, and what better reference for real things than reality itself?".|$|E
2500|$|The game {{ended with}} a final score of 79–10. North Texas's points came on a field goal {{in the third quarter}} and a 69-yard {{touchdown}} pass from quarterback Giovanni Vizza to Casey Fitzgerald {{at the beginning of the}} fourth quarter. The Mean Green finished with 15 yards rushing and 232 yards passing. All three of Oklahoma's quarterbacks saw gametime. Joey Halzle followed Bradford in the third quarter and completed four of his five pass attempts. Nichol finished the game, but did not attempt a pass. The Sooners had 668 yards of total offense against North Texas, the 11th-highest in school history to that point, and 403 passing yards, the fifth-highest in school history to that point. Oklahoma's 482 yards in the first half was the third highest for yardage in a half. Coach Stoops did admit being worried about running up the score. He said, [...] "Well, we were telling our guys not to score, if they broke free we were telling them to take a knee or something. Their style of play didn’t really help either. They got on the line and snapped the ball with 20 or so seconds left on the play clock. I’m not criticizing, I’m just saying that the style of play doesn’t help either.” Former Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer agreed: [...] "They had no game plan for losing… Because when you can't win a game, you need to run the clock, don't let it stop, don't throw passes incomplete… get the game over with, get on the bus and go home." [...] Stoops requested a running clock for the fourth quarter, but the request was not granted. North Texas's coach handled the loss well and held no ill-feelings towards to Sooners for the lopsided win. [...] "When you play a great team like <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> have the chances of obviously this happening,” Dodge said. [...] "Give credit where credit is due – a great Oklahoma football team. Um ... Wow! Very, very impressive.” ...|$|E
