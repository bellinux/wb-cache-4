500|$|On {{the second}} day of filming the documentary, Lohan posted a message on her Twitter account stating: [...] "Over 40 {{children}} saved so far... Within one day's work". Indian non-governmental organization, Bachpan Bachao Andolan, said she had not been part of the raid mentioned and threatened legal action over the post. BBC said Lohan was [...] "misinterpreted" [...] and that [...] "she was merely referring to a raid that happened connected to child trafficking". A few days later Lohan posted again on Twitter praising the work of Bachpan Bachao Andolan. She was originally scheduled to be present for the raid, but due to rescheduling arrived in the country too late. Lohan had also been scheduled to interview a representative for UNICEF for the documentary, but failed to show up. The BBC failed to ensure that Lohan had a proper work visa, which might lead to her being added to an immigration blacklist in India. Of her experience working on the film, Lohan said: [...] "he strength of the young boys and girls I met has been truly humbling" [...] and [...] "I hope my presence in India will bring awareness to <b>the</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> issues raised in making this film".|$|E
500|$|Lohan narrated and {{presented}} the British television documentary Lindsay Lohan's Indian Journey, about human trafficking in India. It was filmed during {{a week in}} India in December 2009, and transmitted on BBC Three in April 2010. The BBC was criticized for having hired Lohan, and while reviewers called the documentary compelling, they also found Lohan's presence to be odd and distracting. Lohan said: [...] "I hope my presence in India will bring awareness to <b>the</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> issues raised in making this film." [...] In April 2010, Lohan was let go from the film The Other Side {{where she had been}} set to star, with the director saying she was [...] "not bankable." [...] In May 2010, Lohan traveled to the Cannes Film Festival to promote the biographical drama Inferno. She was set to star as the lead, adult-film performer Linda Lovelace, but was later replaced while in court mandated rehab. Because she was in Cannes, Lohan missed a mandatory DUI progress hearing. A bench warrant was issued for her arrest which was rescinded after she posted bail. A judge determined that Lohan had violated the terms of her probation by missing several mandatory classes and meetings. She was sentenced to 90 days in jail, followed by 90 days of inpatient rehab treatment. However, Lohan served only 14 days of the jail sentence, due to overcrowding. She then entered an inpatient rehabilitation facility, from where she was released after only 23 days.|$|E

2500|$|He {{explained}} his particular ethos {{and style of}} management of CSIRO in this way: Well, I suppose I always wanted to extrapolate from my own experience, small-scale experience, and some personal opinions. I had a strong desire always to see pure and applied research undertaken {{side by side in}} the same laboratory.... And I was still very much aware that the recognition that many – most, I should say – of <b>the</b> <b>really</b> <b>important</b> and fundamental discoveries in science which subsequently led to a massive technological development have come through curiosity-led research, and often through serendipity, which is terribly important. I think the Birch report was very helpful, and I agreed with his report that the whole core of the policy-making in the science that we were going to carry out was a matter of defining the right proportion of, shall we say, pure research, strategic mission-oriented, and technical research – and getting that proportion right.... I felt that fundamental research in the end was going to reap the real benefits in the long run ... discovering something like electricity ... was absolutely fundamental research and had an enormous impact on the world. On the other hand, there was the awareness that you're in charge of an organisation that's spending a million dollars of taxpayers' money every day, and that's a very sobering thought, so you had to keep the reins on as well. Indeed, there were many frustrations in being CSIRO's Chairman at that time, of which he nominated as the worst [...] "the frustration of finding it so difficult to bring in new young blood because of the descending budget in real terms." ...|$|E

60|$|It may be said, plausibly, that Lord Byron, if {{conscious}} of this crime, {{would not have}} expressed it in his poetry. But his nature was such {{that he could not}} help it.

It appears that he did know that he had been accused of incest, and that Shelley thought that accusation <b>the</b> only <b>really</b> <b>important</b> one; and yet, sensitive as he was to blame and reprobation, he ran upon this very subject most likely to re-awaken scandal.|$|R
