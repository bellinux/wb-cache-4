5|$|Muhammad Yunus was {{inspired}} during the Bangladesh famine of 1974 {{to make a}} small loan of US$27 to a group of 42 families as start-up money so that they could make items for sale, without <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> of high interest under predatory lending. Yunus believed that making such loans available to a larger population could stimulate businesses and reduce the widespread rural poverty in Bangladesh.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{studies the}} logical {{modelling}} of presumptions {{and their effects}} on <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof. Presumptions are modelled as default rules and their effect on <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof is {{defined in terms of}} a distinction between <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of production, <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of persuasion and <b>the</b> tactical <b>burden</b> of proof.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze, how rules of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof and rules of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of argumentation justify a thesis, which is found as a true {{statement}} by court. Two concepts of the truth discussed in the Polish civil procedure (the objective/material truth and the judicial truth) are compared {{in connection with the}} rules of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof and <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of argumentation. <b>The</b> rules of <b>burden</b> of proof and the rules of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of argumentation are constitutive rules. They state under what conditions a thesis counts as justified. The justification of a decision of applying law based on the rules of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof or rules of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of argumentation is institutional, not substantial...|$|R
5|$|Chappell had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on Hughes' successor, Allan Border. Early in his captaincy tenure, Border was struggling with <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> of the position so the ACB appointed Bob Simpson as team coach to assist. This led to animosity between Chappell and Simpson as Chappell derided {{the need for a}} coach. Simpson responded by writing that the peer influence of older players helping younger players fell away during the era when the Chappell brothers led the team, and he was redressing the problem.|$|E
5|$|Expanding on {{the dense}} {{production}} style of West's 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Watch the Throne incorporates orchestral and progressive rock influences, unconventional samples, and dramatic melodies in its sound. Jay-Z and West's braggadocio lyrics exhibit themes of opulence, fame, materialism, power, and <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> of success, {{as well as}} political and socioeconomic context. The album expresses other topics such as Jay-Z's thoughts on fatherhood, West's reflection on being deemed a social villain, and their success as performers. Music writers interpreted the subject matter to concern the rappers' plight as African Americans struggling with financial success in America.|$|E
5|$|Charles X Gustav, with a {{force of}} 11,000 horse, reacted by {{pursuing}} Czarniecki's force of 2,400 men, confronting and defeating him in the Battle of Gołąb in February 1656. Charles X Gustav then intended to take Lwow, but his advance was halted in the Battle of Zamość, when he was nearly encircled by the growing Polish–Lithuanian armies under Sapieha and Czarniecki, and barely escaped on 5 and 6 April breaking through Sapieha's lines during the Battle of Sandomierz {{at the cost of}} his artillery and baggage. A Swedish relief force under Frederick of Baden was destroyed by Czarniecki on 7 April in the Battle of Warka. In the same month, John II Casimir with the Lwów Oath proclaimed Virgin Mary queen of Poland, and promised to lift <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> inflicted on the peasantry if he regained control.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "burden of proof" [...] {{is used to}} mean {{two kinds}} of burdens: <b>The</b> <b>burden</b> of {{production}} (or <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of [...] "going forward with the evidence") and <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of persuasion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{satisfaction}} of <b>the</b> evidential <b>burden</b> {{has sometimes been}} described as [...] "shifting <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof", a label which has been criticized because <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> placed on a defendant is not <b>the</b> legal <b>burden</b> of proof resting on the prosecution.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>burden</b> {{for showing}} joint defense {{is the same}} as <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> for showing {{attorney}} client privilege. The party asserting the joint defense agreement always bears <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of demonstrating its existence by establishing each element of the attorney client privilege. Likewise, the party asserting privilege, both in the context of joint defense agreements and otherwise, bears <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proving <b>the</b> applicability of the privilege.|$|R
5|$|Randall {{worked with}} Republicans {{to shift the}} source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He {{believed}} the taxation of alcohol spread <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> of taxation unfairly, especially as concerned his constituents, who included several distillers. He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a federal district court. He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.|$|E
5|$|Serving as Secretary of the Treasury in the {{administration}} of Rutherford B. Hayes, Sherman continued his efforts for financial stability and solvency, overseeing an end to wartime inflationary measures and a return to gold-backed money. He returned to the Senate after his term expired, serving there for a further sixteen years. During that time he continued his work on financial legislation, as well as writing and debating laws on immigration, business competition law, and the regulation of interstate commerce. Sherman was the principal author of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which was signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison. In 1897, President William McKinley appointed him Secretary of State. Failing health and declining faculties made him unable to handle <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> of the job, and he retired in 1898 {{at the start of the}} Spanish–American War. Sherman died at his home in Washington, D.C. in 1900.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Empire {{reached its}} {{greatest}} territorial extent {{during the second}} century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create the Crisis of the Third Century, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the third century, mainly {{in response to the}} war with the Sasanian Empire, which revived {{in the middle of the}} third century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the Roman legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> of holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{principle}} shifts <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof. If {{the principle}} applies, <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> shifts: [...] "a decision maker must assume {{the threat of}} serious or irreversible environmental damage is… a reality and <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of showing this threat… is negligible reverts to the proponent…" ...|$|R
25|$|The {{party that}} does not carry <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof carries the benefit of {{assumption}} of being correct, they are presumed to be correct, until <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> shifts after presentation of evidence by the party bringing the action. An example is in an American criminal case, {{where there is a}} presumption of innocence by the defendant. Fulfilling <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof effectively captures the benefit of assumption, passing <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof off to another party.|$|R

5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{problems}} {{pertaining to the}} allocation of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof in mixed disputes in legal and non-legal contexts are addressed. First the traditional view on the allocation of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof based on Whately’s legal conception of ‘presumption’ is discussed. Whately’s proposal is not adequate for the solution of problems related to the allocation of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof in everyday mixed disputes {{where there is no}} presumption of status quo. Using the pragma-dialectical perspective it is explained how practical questions regarding the division of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof are solved in a legal context. It is shown that for argumentation theory, the combination of material and procedural rules for the allocation of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof offer an instrument for the allocation of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof in both legal and non-legal discussions...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>burden</b> {{of persuasion}} {{should not be}} {{confused}} with <b>the</b> evidential <b>burden,</b> or burden of production, or duty of producing (or going forward with) evidence which is an obligation that may shift between parties over the course of the hearing or trial. <b>The</b> evidential <b>burden</b> is <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> to adduce sufficient evidence to properly raise an issue at court.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>burden</b> {{of proof}} (...) is {{the duty of}} a party in a trial to produce the {{evidence}} that will prove the claims they have made against the other party. In a legal dispute, one party is initially presumed to be correct and gets the benefit of the doubt, while the other side bears <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof. When a party bearing <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof meets their <b>burden,</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof switches to <b>the</b> other side. <b>Burdens</b> may be of different kinds for each party, in different phases of litigation. <b>The</b> <b>burden</b> of production is a minimal burden to produce at least enough evidence for the trier of fact to consider a disputed claim. After litigants have met <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of production and their claim is being considered by a trier of fact, they have <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of persuasion, that enough evidence has been presented to persuade the trier of fact that their side is correct. There are different standards of persuasiveness ranging from a preponderance of the evidence, where there is just enough evidence to tip the balance, to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as in United States criminal courts.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} logical {{modelling}} of presumptions {{and their effects}} on <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of proof.

These notions are logically characterised {{in such a way that}} presumptions enable a party to fulfil a burden of production or persuasion while shifting a tactical <b>burden</b> to <b>the</b> other party. Finally, it is shown how debates about what can be presumed can be modelled as debates about the backings of default rule...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} the main issues {{raised in the}} practical application regarding <b>the</b> <b>burden.</b> <b>The</b> first part men faced {{the thought of the}} doctrine and jurisprudence regarding <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> placed on <b>the</b> donation and testament, with particular regard to the problem of the nature of <b>the</b> <b>burden.</b> <b>The</b> second part deals with defining the meaning of «any interested person» (art. 648 c. c.), because this is important to determine, in the silence of the law, which is the structure of <b>the</b> <b>burden.</b> In <b>the</b> third chapter deals with the issue of discipline applicable burden from different points of view: <b>the</b> responsibility of <b>burden,</b> <b>the</b> impossibility or illegality of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> (art. 647, paragraph 3, c. c.), the resolution of the testamentary provision in case of nonperformance of <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> and <b>the</b> identification of a criterion how to distinguish from other figures related to it, as the condition, the legacy or the mandate post mortem. The thesis aims to demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> takes on different characteristics depending on whether it is included into a donation or in a will. This circumstance suggests separate discussion of two figures of burden and will be developed in this thesis the main issues regarding testamentary <b>burden.</b> <b>The</b> central issue is constituted by the determination of the accidental, incidental or self-burden, which is closely related, in general, with the understanding of the inheritance system and, in particular, with the definition of a will. The theme of the chapter fifth chapter is whether <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> could constitute a means of introducing in the will a prohibition against alienation or a binding of destination on a property for the fulfillment of a certain purpose. ...|$|R
