This study provides important findings regarding the disease pattern {{among the elderly}} people and the factors associated with such <b>transitions.</b> <b>The</b> Health and Retirement Study data are considered {{for the period of}} 1992 - 2000. The major diseases or complications considered in this study are stroke, lung diseases, diabetes mellitus, blood pressure and arthritis. <b>The</b> <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> different diseases or complications are explained by selected covariates such as gender, race, marital status, smoking, drinking, physical exercise and BMI. The results indicate that gender, race, smoking and BMI are significantly associated with <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> different diseases or complications. The results are displayed for <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> each disease or complication separately for competing risk framework as well as for <b>the</b> combined <b>transition</b> <b>to</b> any of <b>the</b> selected diseases or complications. This paper reveals some important health issues related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>transitions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> selected diseases or complications among the elderly people and the factors associated with such transitions are identified...|$|R

Accordingly, this gives a [...] or (real-)analytic structure on the manifold rather than a smooth one.

A major crisis emerged within {{the government}} over the refusal of the Front de l'Indépendance (FI-OF) and the Partisans Armés (PA), two large left-wing resistance groups, to disband and disarm. Pierlot, suspicious of the FI's motivatives, came into confrontation with the Communists. The three Communist ministers resigned from the government, and the party began agitating against it. Amid fears of a Communist coup d'état, parliament voted through emergency powers allowing the Gendarmerie to forcibly disarm the resistance though sporadic strikes continued. The government also voted through important social security reforms.|$|E
