I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the Gobblers {{football}} team, he was the team captain for the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SAIAA) champion 1918 VPI squad.

In recognition of his accomplishments as an athlete at VPI, in 1987 Crisp was inducted into the Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|By contrast, ovarian cancer, {{the leading}} cause of {{reproductive}} organ cancer deaths, and the fifth commonest cause of cancer deaths in women in the United States, lacks an effective screening programme, and is predominantly a disease of women in industrialised countries.

5|$|Cacti were {{cultivated}} as ornamental {{plants from}} <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> were first {{brought from the}} New World. By the early 1800s, enthusiasts in Europe had large collections (often including other succulents alongside cacti). Rare plants were sold for very high prices. Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.|$|E

5|$|His {{impact was}} {{not only on the}} world of education, but also on Argentine {{political}} and social structure.

5|$|In {{addition}} to his attention to detail in diet and fitness, he also afforded close scrutiny to his kit. 1950–51 he struck a boot sponsorship deal with the Co-op, though he instead began wearing a more lightweight pair of boots he had discovered on show at the World Cup – at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> were not available to buy in England.

5|$|In {{identical}} twins, if one {{is affected}} there is a 50–60% chance that the other will also be affected. In non-identical twins the risk is 15%. These risks are greater in those with generalized rather than focal seizures. If both twins are affected, most of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> have the same epileptic syndrome (70–90%). Other close relatives of a person with epilepsy have a risk five {{times that of the}} general population. Between 1 and 10% of those with Down syndrome and 90% of those with Angelman syndrome have epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Incubation takes 56days, and {{the male}} stops {{incubating}} the eggs shortly before they hatch. The temperature of the nest rises slightly during the eight-week period. Although the eggs are laid sequentially, they tend to hatch within two days of one another, as the eggs that were laid later experienced higher temperatures and developed more rapidly. During the process, the precocial emu chicks {{need to develop a}} capacity for thermoregulation. During incubation, the embryos are kept at a constant temperature but the chicks will {{need to be able to}} cope with varying external temperatures by <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>they</b> hatch.|$|E

Medwin left Geneva in September 1820 to visit his cousin, Percy Shelley, in Pisa. Jane and Edward then travelled to France for several months, before joining Medwin and the Shelleys in Pisa in January 1821.|$|E
