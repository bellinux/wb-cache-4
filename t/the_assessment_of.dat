40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present work were to examine the relationships between sensory <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> air quality made using different methods: odor intensity by category scale, category-ratio scale and equal-intensity matching with acetone as a reference and acceptability scale, and to study whether <b>the</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> acceptability {{can be explained by}} selected characteristics of the air. A sensory panel assessed the air polluted by emissions from different building materials at different area-specific ventilation rates. <b>The</b> three <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> odor intensity were linearly strongly correlated with each other. Therefore, for practical applications it seems feasible to apply only one of the investigated methods. Odor intensity was strongly correlated with <b>the</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> acceptability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> air. This suggests that, for the investigated materials, <b>the</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> acceptability are mainly influenced by odor intensity. The selected descriptors characterizing the air could not explain <b>the</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> acceptability because <b>the</b> odor intensity levels were generally low...|$|R

These assessments were compared to a ranking of each country’s environmental quality by an expert panel.

Spatial optimism bias (‘‘things are better here than there’’) was found in <b>the</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> current environmental conditions in 15 of 18 countries, but not in <b>the</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> future. All countries except one exhibited temporal pessimism, but significant differences between them were common. Evaluations of current environmental conditions also differed by country.

The order to attack was drawn up on 17 September and signed by Major General Vinko Vrbanac on behalf of the Chief of the General Staff, General Zvonimir Červenko. The attack, codenamed Operation Una, was to commence with crossings of the Una River at Novi Grad and Bosanska Dubica, and the Sava River at Jasenovac, followed by the seizing of Mount Prosara to allow for further advances towards Prijedor. The operation was intended to be coordinated with the ARBiH 5th Corps, which would continue its rapid advance towards Prijedor and Novi Grad.|$|E

METHODS: <b>The</b> Brief <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> Cognition in Schizophrenia {{was administered to}} 116 stable patients with schizophrenia and 58 matched control subjects. To assess concurrent validity, a subset of patients underwent a traditional neuropsychological <b>assessment.</b> RESULTS: <b>The</b> patients with schizophrenia performed significantly worse than the controls (po 0. 001) on all subtests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brief <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> Cognition in Schizophrenia and on the total score, which attests to the discriminant validity of the test. The global score <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brief <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> Cognition in Schizophrenia was significantly correlated {{with all of the}} subtests and with the global score for the standard battery. <b>The</b> Brief <b>Assessment</b> <b>of</b> Cognition in Schizophrenia also had good test-retest reliability (rho 40. 8).

5|$|Reports {{of severe}} and even fatal {{hepatotoxicity}} {{related to the}} use of methoxyflurane began to appear in 1966. These reports prompted anesthesiologists to subject this agent to intense and systematic scrutiny. A study published in 1973 by Cousins and Mazze demonstrated that compared with halothane, methoxyflurane produces dose-dependent and deleterious abnormalities in renal function. The authors showed that subclinical nephrotoxicity occurred following methoxyflurane at minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for 2.5 to 3hours (2.5 to 3MAC hours), while overt toxicity was present in all patients at dosages greater than five MAC hours. This landmark study provided a model that would be used for <b>the</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the nephrotoxicity of volatile anesthetics for the next two decades.|$|E
