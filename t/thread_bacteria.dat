40|$|The {{symbiosis}} between (brady) rhizobia and legumes {{is known}} to proceed {{through a series of}} characteristic stages. The pre-infection stage includes recognition of two symbiotic partners, attachment of bacteria to the plant roots and deformation of root hairs. In the next stage, deformed root hairs are invaded by bacteria which grow and penetrate within a unique plant-derived infection thread. At the same time cell division is initiated in root cortical cells and this elaborates the formation of meristems. Infection threads grow towards these meristems and a nodule structure is formed wherein differentiation of tissue type occurs. From the growing infection <b>thread</b> <b>bacteria</b> are released into some of the newly formed nodule cells. Finally, the cooperation of nodule cells and differentiated bacteroids leads to a nitrogen fixing plant organ...|$|E

40|$|Two cDNA clones of the soybean early nodulin GmENOD 55 were characterized. These clones may {{represent}} {{two members of}} the soybean early nodulin gene family GmENOD 55. GmENOD 55 has an N-terminal signal peptide and it contains an internal domain consisting of proline and serine residues. Analyses of nodules lacking infection <b>threads</b> and intracellular <b>bacteria</b> suggest that the GmENOD 55 gene is first expressed after release ofBradyrhizobium japonicum in plant cells. This conclusion is supported byin situ hybridization studies showing that the expression is restricted to the infected cell type...|$|R

Silver-enhanced immunogold-labeled tissue sections revealed that, in very young tissues of pea root nodules, the nodule-induced form of lipopolysaccharide antigen was not expressed either by rhizobia in the infection <b>thread</b> or by <b>bacteria</b> recently released into the plant cell cytoplasm. In the more mature regions of the nodule, the antigen was expressed by membrane-enclosed bacteroids, including immature forms that had not yet expressed the enzyme nitrogenase and were not yet Y shaped.

40|$|Jordan, D. C. (Ontario Agricultural College, Guelph, Canada), I. Grinyer, and W. H. Coulter. Electron {{microscopy}} {{of infection}} <b>threads</b> and <b>bacteria</b> in young root nodules of Medicago sativa. J. Bacteriol. 86 : 125 – 137. 1963. —Ultrathin sections of alfalfa nodules (Medicago sativa L.) revealed that initially the infection thread {{consisted of a}} naked mucoid strand, containing imbedded bacteria, migrating between {{the walls of the}} cortical cells of the host plant. At certain locations, the plant cell walls were forced into a funnel-shaped structure which elongated to form a tubular sheath containing bacterial cells and gum. Lateral and terminal vesicles formed on the ensheathed infection thread, and these burst to liberate the bacteria into the host cell cytoplasm, the process being similar to that proposed by certain of the earlier workers. In some cases, the ensheathed thread migrated entirely across a host cell without rupturing, and, in this case, the tip of the thread fused into the host cell wall opposite the point of entry. The bacteria, after their release from the thread, became bacteroidal, and ultimately each bacterial cell became surrounded by a double-layered membrane. It is suggested that this enclosing membrane may be derived from the tubules of the endoplasmic reticulum, although the possibility of the formation of these membranes de novo as a protective mechanism of the host plant cannot entirely be disregarded...|$|R
40|$|To help dissect the {{molecular}} {{basis of the}} Rhizobium-legume symbiosis, we used in vitro translation and Northern blot analysis of nodule RNA to examine alfalfa-specific genes (nodulins) expressed in two types of developmentally defective root nodules elicited by Rhizobium meliloti. Fix- nodules were elicited by R. meliloti nif mutants; these nodules were invaded by rhizobia and contained differentiated bacteroids. 'Empty' nodules were elicited by R. meliloti exo and ndv mutants and by Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains carrying the R. meliloti nod genes; these nodules contained a nodule meristem but lacked infection <b>threads,</b> intracellular <b>bacteria,</b> and bacteroids. Fix- nodules contained a spectrum of nodulins similar to wild-type nodules. In contrast, only two nodulins, Nms- 30 and a nodulin homologous to ENOD 2 of soybean, were detected in empty nodules. Although R. meliloti ndv and exo mutants elicited nodules with the same defective phenotype, ndv and exo mutants (except for exoC mutants) had distinct biochemical phenotypes. R. meliloti ndvA and ndvB mutants were deficient in cyclic glucan production but not the acidic exopolysaccharide; the converse was true for exoA, exoB, and exoF mutants. exoC mutants were defective in both exopolysaccharide and cyclic glucan biosynthesis. Our results support the model that the R. meliloti nod genes produce a signal that results in nodule meristem induction. Both the exopolysaccharide and cyclic glucan, however, appear to act at {{the next step in}} the developmental process and are involved in the production of a signal (or structure) that allows infection thread formation and invasion of the nodule...|$|R

Electron {{microscopy}} of {{the infection}} and subsequent development of soybean nodule cells. J. Bacteriol. 92 : 204 – 213. 1966 —Electron microscopy of thin {{sections of the}} developing central tissue cells of young soybean root nodules has shown that infection is initiated by a few infection threads which penetrate cells of the young central tissue. Extension growth of the threads may {{be a result of}} pressure developed from the growth of the <b>bacteria</b> within the <b>threads.</b> Release of <b>bacteria</b> from a <b>thread</b> is preceded by the development on an infection thread of a bulge with a cellulose-free membrane-bounded extension; bacteria move from this into the host cells by an endocytotic process and remain enclosed in an infection vacuole which is bounded by a membrane of host-cell origin. Multiplication of the intracellular bacteria takes place within these vacuoles. Until the host cell becomes filled with bacteria, the vacuoles separate into discrete units at each division. Later, division of the bacteria occurs within each vacuole, thus leading to the mature structure of the central tissue cells in which several bacteria are enclosed within each membrane-bounded unit...|$|R
40|$|In the {{symbiotic}} {{interaction between}} Azorhizobium caulinodans and Sesbania rostrata root and stem-borne nodules are formed. The bacteria enter the host via intercellular spaces at lateral or adventitious root bases and form infection pockets in outer cortical layers. Infection <b>threads</b> guide the <b>bacteria</b> to nodule primordia where plant cells are invaded. To identify bacterial functions {{that are required}} for this infection process, two mutants defective in nodulation were studied; one produced no Nod factors (nodA mutant), the other had altered surface polysaccharides (SPS) and induced the formation of pseudo-nodules, Bacteria were visualized {{with the help of}} a nodA-uidA reporter fusion that was functional during nodule development and in bacteroids. In contrast to the SPS mutant, nodA mutants were unable to colonize outer cortical regions. In mixed inoculations with both mutants, functional nodules were formed, the central tissue of which was occupied by the nodA mutant. These observations suggest that SPS play a role in deeper invasion and that Nod factors are necessary for entry. Simultaneous application of purified Nod factors and nodA mutant bacteria restored the formation of outer cortical infection pockets leading to the conclusion that intercellular infection is an active process that is dependent on bacterial Nod factor signaling...|$|R
40|$|Legumes {{are able}} to form endosymbiotic {{interactions}} with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. Endosymbiosis takes shape in formation of a symbiotic organ, the root nodule. Medicago truncatula (M. truncatula) nodules contain several zones representing subsequent stages of development. The apical part of the nodule consists of the meristem and the infection zone. At this site, bacteria are released into the host cell from infection <b>threads.</b> Upon release, <b>bacteria</b> are surrounded by a host cell–derived membrane to form symbiosomes. After release, rhizobia grow, divide, and gradually colonize the entire host cell of the fixation zone of root nodules. Therefore, mature infected cells contain thousands of symbiosomes, which remain as individual units among other organelles. Visualization of the organization and dynamics of the symbiosomes {{as well as other}} organelles in infected cells of nodules is essential to understand mechanisms regulating the development of endosymbiosis between plants and rhizobia. To examine this highly dynamic developmental process we designed a useful imaging technique that is based on confocal scanning microscopy combined with different fluorescent dyes and GFP-tagged proteins (Gavrin et al., 2014). Here, we describe a protocol for microscopic observation, 3 D rendering, and volume/area measurements of symbiosomes and other organelles in infected cells of M. truncatula root nodules. This protocol can be applied for monitoring the development of different host-microbe interactions whether symbiotic or pathogenic...|$|R
40|$|Plants require {{nutrients}} {{in order to}} grow. Most of these are readily available, but a few, like the macronutrients nitrogen and phosphorous, are often limiting growth due to presence in low concentrations or in complexes that cannot be {{taken up by the}} plant root. To acquire these macronutrients plants can engage in a mutualistic symbiosis with other organisms. Most plants can interact with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi that are able to solubilize complexed phosphorous. A subset of these plants, the legumes, can also interact with bacteria that can reduce atmospheric nitrogen into compounds plants can assimilate. Both interactions are so-called endosymbioses because the microsymbiont enters host cells. A symbiosis requires a good balance between costs and benefits. Therefore, infection is only initiated when the specific nutrient is scarce. Further, the host plant requires that the mutualistic microsymbionts produce signal molecules to identify themselves, and thereby prevents other (pathogenic) microorganisms to enter by similar mechanisms. The signal molecule(s) involved in mycorrhizal symbioses have not yet been identified. However, the rhizobial signal molecule, the so-called nodulation (Nod) factor has been identified and extensively studied. It has been intensively studied how Nod factors are perceived and how they induce Nod factor specific responses, including the formation of a completely new organ, the root nodule. In chapter one, we describe {{the state of the art}} (in 2005) regarding Nod factor signal transduction. Several approaches have been used to unravel Nod factor signaling in legumes, but the molecular-genetic approach has been most successful. More than 10 years after the first characterization of a Nod factor structure most genes essential for Nod factor signal transduction have been cloned and characterized. Additionally, the identification of these genes provides insight in how the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis evolved, because some of the identified Nod factor signaling genes are also essential to the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. The DMI genes, encoding a LRR receptor kinase, an ion channel, and a calcium/calmodulin dependent protein kinase, are required for both symbioses and are essential for most responses. The genes encoding the Nod factor receptors (NFR 1, NFR 5, LYK 3, NFP), Nod factor response factors (NSP 1, NSP 2) and Nod factor responsive factors (NIN) show that besides the DMI genes additional genes are required to induce Nod factor specific responses. Therefore it is likely that the Rhizobium-legume symbiosis evolved from the more ancient mycorrhizal symbioses, but during evolution the nodulation specific genes have been recruited to induce Nod factor specific responses. In chapter two, we elaborate on two of the genes, NSP 1 and DMI 3, we introduced in chapter 1. We show in that chapter that NSP 1 is a primary transcriptional regulator essential for the regulation of all Nod factor regulated genes, NSP 1 is: a member of the GRAS transcription factor family; constitutively expressed; localized in the nucleus where also DMI 3, acting upstream of NSP 1, is being localized; essential for regulation of all known Nod factor regulated genes. NSP 1 is a conserved member of the GRAS type protein family in the plant kingdom. Therefore, it is likely that NSP 1, besides its normal function, gained a function in Nod factor signaling. In chapter three, we describe the identification of HCL, a gene required for root hair curling and infection, but not essential for other Nod factor-induced responses. We show by isolation of the weak hcl- 4 mutant allele that HCL is also involved in infection thread formation. HCL encodes the previously identified Nod factor receptor LYK 3. In hcl- 4 infection thread growth, but not root hair curling, is dependent on the Nod factor structure excreted by the Rhizobium bacteria; only if the bacteria excrete the wild type Nod factor they are able to nodulate hcl- 4 mutants. LYK 3 is also essential for the regulation of a subset of Nod factor induced genes. However, NIN, a Nod factor regulated gene that is essential for both infection and nodule primordium formation, is not regulated by LYK 3. The identification and characterization of hcl/lyk 3 mutants is important as from previous work it was not clear whether LYK 3 acts as a signaling or entry receptor. In this chapter, we clearly show that LYK 3 acts as an infection receptor that regulates infection in a Nod factor structure dependent manner. In chapter three, we have shown that the infection receptor LYK 3 is essential for specificity during infection. This receptor regulates bacterial growth in the infection thread. However, what mechanism the plant uses to prevent that other incompatible bacteria do grow along during infection? In chapter four we study bacterial growth in infection threads and show, using the fluorescent timer protein DsRED 1 -E 5, that probably only at the tip of infection <b>threads</b> <b>bacteria</b> do grow. Therefore, during infection thread growth, most likely a continual selection of Nod factor producing Rhizobium bacteria takes place that will ultimately infect the nodule primordium established in the root cortex. This thesis is finalized (chapter five) by discussing new data obtained during the last couple of years, and draw new or readjust old conclusions. We discuss the following themes: how is the Nod factor signal transduced from the plasmamembrane into the nucleus; how did Nod factor signaling genes evolve; are there any new Nod factor signaling genes identified; is it useful to conduct more classical genetic screens for genes involved in root nodule symbiosis; and finally how Nod factor signal transduction plays a role in infection thread formation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the {{mechanisms}} of bacterial interaction with implant materials in the oral cavity. Other surface characteristics, in addition to surface roughness, seem to be extremely important in relation to plaque formation. Different adhesion affinities of bacteria were reported for different materials. Anatase is a nanoparticle that can be applied to titanium surfaces as a coating. The anatase coating gives special characteristics to the implant surface, including some genetic effects on osteoblasts. In this study, the antibacterial effect of anatase is investigated. The aim {{of this study is to}} characterize the percentages of surfaces covered by bacteria on commercially pure (cp) titanium and anatase-coated healing screws. Methods: Ten patients participated in this study. The protocol of the study was approved by the ethics committee of the University of Chieti-Pescara. A total of 20 healing screws (10 test and 10 control screws) were used in the study. The control screws were made of cp titanium, whereas the test screws were coated with anatase. Cleaning procedures and agents for chemical plaque control were not applied to the healing screws for the complete duration of the test period. After 7 days, all healing screws were removed, substituted, and processed under scanning electron microscopy for evaluation of the portions of the surfaces covered by bacteria. Results: The supracrestal screw surfaces covered by bacteria on test specimens were not significantly lower than those of control screws (P = 0. 174). The subcrestal screw surfaces and <b>threads</b> covered by <b>bacteria</b> on test specimens were significantly lower than those of control screws, and P values were 0. 001 and 0. 000, respectively. Conclusion: Results show that anatase could be a suitable material for coating implant abutments, with a low colonization potential. J Periodontol 2010; 81 : 1466 - 1471...|$|R
40|$|Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii {{is capable}} of {{establishing}} a symbiotic relationship with plants from the genus Trifolium. Previously, a regulatory protein encoded by rosR was identified and characterized in this bacterium. RosR possesses a Cys 2 -His 2 -type zinc finger motif and belongs to Ros/MucR family of rhizobial transcriptional regulators. Transcriptome profiling of the rosR mutant revealed a role of this protein in several cellular processes, including the synthesis of cell-surface components and polysaccharides, motility, and bacterial metabolism. Here, we show that a mutation in rosR resulted in considerable changes in R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii protein profiles. Extracellular, membrane, and periplasmic protein profiles of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii wild type and the rosR mutant were examined, and proteins with substantially different abundances between these strains were identified. Compared with the wild type, extracellular fraction of the rosR mutant contained greater amounts of several proteins, including Ca 2 +-binding cadherin-like proteins, a RTX-like protein, autoaggregation protein RapA 1, and flagellins FlaA and FlaB. In contrast, several proteins involved in the uptake of various substrates were less abundant in the mutant strain (DppA, BraC, and SfuA). In addition, differences were observed in membrane proteins of the mutant and wild-type strains, which mainly concerned various transport system components. Using atomic force microscopy imaging, we characterized the topography and surface properties of the rosR mutant and wild-type cells. We found that the mutation in rosR gene also affected surface properties of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii. The mutant cells were significantly more hydrophobic than the wild-type cells, and their outer membrane was three times more permeable to the hydrophobic dye N-phenyl- 1 -naphthylamine. The mutation of rosR also caused defects in bacterial symbiotic interaction with clover plants. Compared with the wild type, the rosR mutant infected host plant roots much less effectively and its nodule occupation was disturbed. At the ultrastructural level, the most striking differences between the mutant and the wild-type nodules concerned the structure of infection <b>threads,</b> release of <b>bacteria,</b> and bacteroid differentiation. This confirms an essential role of RosR in establishment of successful symbiotic interaction of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii with clover plants...|$|R
