40|$|A simple {{conduction}} {{model with}} phase {{change has been}} developed for the transient analysis of a fuel pin based on average properties and lumped-parameter techniques. The transient behavior of fuel <b>and</b> <b>cladding</b> can be accurately described by simple analytical expressions that agree with conventional numerical approaches for under-cooling transient analysis. If it be assumed that the heat-transfer resistance between the fuel <b>and</b> <b>cladding</b> remains the same for both steady-state and transient periods, the phase-change problem for fuel <b>and</b> <b>cladding</b> melting can be significantly simplified. BY using the predetermined average overall heat-transfer coefficient across a fuel pin in the steady-state period, the average transient fuel <b>and</b> <b>cladding</b> temperatures can be formulated analytically. For loss of flow at constant power, the start of melting and complete melting for both the fuel <b>and</b> <b>cladding</b> can be estimated with considerable accuracy...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a cascaded feedback control strategy for a vapor-phase axial deposition (VAD) process is investigated in this paper. VAD is a widely used process {{in the creation of}} high purity glass for optical fiber. In previous work a soot tip surface temperature controller was developed for the VAD process to reduce the effects of core soot temperature variation on deposition, leading to a more stable process. However, this approach did not address the need to regulate and link the deposition rates of the core <b>and</b> <b>clad</b> torches. To maintain a constant distance between the core <b>and</b> <b>clad</b> deposition surfaces, it is desired to have the core soot <b>and</b> <b>clad</b> soot depositing at the same linear speed to provide a more uniform product. This paper presents the design and {{development of}} a cascaded controller strategy and process model to couple and regulate the surface temperature and deposition rates of core <b>and</b> <b>clad</b> soot. Simulations for the process and control scheme demonstrate a potential improvement in the uniformity of the core <b>and</b> <b>clad</b> soot geometry over the soot product length...|$|R

The various annealed diffusion couples were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy to investigate the kinetics of the fuel-cladding interactions and to identify the types of phases that formed. Relatively large diffusion zones were observed for some of the couples between metallic fuel <b>and</b> <b>cladding</b> samples. In some cases, specific phases appeared to melt. In the cases where large diffusion structures were not observed, a surface layer was present in the fuel alloy that appeared to impede interdiffusion...|$|R

40|$|The <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill method allows {{estimation}} of an adjusted meta-analysis estimate {{in the presence}} of publication bias. To date, the performance of the <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill method has had little assessment. In this paper, we provide a more comprehensive examination of different versions of the <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill method in a number of simulated meta-analysis scenarios, comparing results with those from usual unadjusted meta-analysis models and two simple alternatives, namely use of the estimate from: (i) the largest; or (ii) the most precise study in the meta-analysis. Findings suggest a great deal of variability in the performance of the different approaches. When there is large between-study heterogeneity the <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill method can underestimate the true positive effect when there is no publication bias. However, when publication bias is present the <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill method can give estimates that are less biased than the usual meta-analysis models. Although results suggest that the use of the estimate from the largest or most precise study seems a reasonable approach {{in the presence of}} publication bias, when between-study heterogeneity exists our simulations show that these estimates are quite biased. We conclude that in the presence of publication bias use of the <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill method can help to reduce the bias in pooled estimates, even though the performance of this method is not ideal. However, because we do not know whether funnel plot asymmetry is truly caused by publication bias, and because there is great variability in the performance of different <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill estimators and models in various meta-analysis scenarios, we recommend use of the <b>trim</b> <b>and</b> fill method as a form of sensitivity analysis as intended by the authors of the method. 2009...|$|R
40|$|The most {{limiting}} {{design criteria}} for nuclear reactor normal operating conditions (ANS Condition I) {{are known to}} be rod internal pressure <b>and</b> <b>cladding</b> oxidation, while those for nuclear reactor transient operating conditions (ANS Conditon II) to be fuel centerline temperature <b>and</b> transient <b>cladding</b> total tensile strain. However, the design margins against fuel temperature <b>and</b> transient <b>cladding</b> tensile strain become smaller since power uprating is being or will be utilized for the most of nuclear power reactors to enhance the economics of nuclear power. In order to secure sufficient design margins against fuel temperature <b>and</b> <b>cladding</b> total tensile strain even for power uprating, the current axial rod power profiles used in the reactor transient analysis were optimized to reduce over-conservatism, considering that 118 % overpower of a steady-state peak rod average power was not exceeded during the reactor transients. The comparison of the current axial rod power profiles and the optimized ones indicates that the latter reduces the fuel centerline temperature <b>and</b> <b>cladding</b> total tensile strain by 26 °C and 0. 02 %, respectively...|$|R
