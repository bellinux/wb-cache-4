5|$|A third North American genus called Stegomus {{was named}} by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1896. Marsh had a long-time rivalry with Cope {{that was made}} famous in the Bone Wars of the late 19th century, {{in which the two}} tried to out-compete one another in the field and in {{scientific}} literature. Unlike Cope's aetosaurs, Stegomus was found from the eastern United States in Connecticut. Marsh also recognized Stegomus as an aetosaur rather than a phytosaur in his initial description of the genus. Like Cope, many paleontologists tended to consider aetosaur scutes <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> to phytosaurs during this time period.|$|E
5|$|Alignment {{with the}} Indonesian government, however, did not {{guarantee}} safety for the Torajans. In 1965, a presidential decree required every Indonesian citizen <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> {{to one of}} five officially recognised religions: Islam, Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Hinduism, or Buddhism. The Torajan religious belief (aluk) was not legally recognised, and the Torajans raised their voices against the law. To make aluk accord with the law, {{it had to be}} accepted as part of one of the official religions. In 1969, Aluk To Dolo ("the way of ancestors") was legalised as a sect of Agama Hindu Dharma, the official name of Hinduism in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, {{it appears}} <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> to a stellar association called the Castor Moving Group.

All {{members of the group}} are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound. The estimated age of this moving group is , and they have an average space velocity of 16.5km/s.|$|E
