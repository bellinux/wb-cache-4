5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a thing that is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end <b>the</b> <b>infinite</b> chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E

5|$|Back in the 15th century, German theologian Nicolaus Cusanus {{speculated that}} the Universe lacked a center and a circumference. He {{believed}} that the Universe, while not infinite, could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained. These ideas led to speculations as to <b>the</b> <b>infinite</b> dimension of space by the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno in the 16th century. He extended the Copernican heliocentric cosmology {{to the concept of}} an infinite Universe filled with a substance he called aether, which did not cause resistance to the motions of heavenly bodies. English philosopher William Gilbert arrived at a similar conclusion, arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void. This concept of an aether originated with ancient Greek philosophers, including Aristotle, who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies moved.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{existence}} of an actual infinity was an important shared concern within the realms of mathematics, philosophy and religion. Preserving the orthodoxy of the relationship between God and mathematics, although not in the same form as held by his critics, was long a concern of Cantor's. He directly addressed this intersection between these disciplines in the introduction to his Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre, where he stressed the connection between his view of <b>the</b> <b>infinite</b> and the philosophical one. To Cantor, his mathematical views were intrinsically linked to their philosophical and theological implications – he identified the Absolute Infinite with God, and he considered his work on transfinite numbers to have been directly communicated to him by God, who had chosen Cantor to reveal them to the world.|$|E
