5|$|Amman is {{considered}} one of the most liberal and westernized cities in <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world.</b> The city has become one of the most popular destinations for Western expatriates and college students who seek to live, study, or work in the Middle East or <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world</b> in general.

5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} {{with the people}} of <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world,</b> by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria. In September, Turkish troops massed along the Syrian border, giving credence to rumors that the Baghdad Pact countries were attempting to topple Syria's leftist government. Nasser sent a contingent force to Syria as a symbolic display of solidarity, further elevating his prestige in <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world,</b> and particularly among Syrians.|$|E

5|$|The French {{started their}} rule by {{sentencing}} 21 nationalist leaders, including Quwatli, {{to death on}} 1 August 1920. Quwatli managed to flee only hours before a warrant for his arrest was issued. From Damascus he fled by car to Haifa in British-mandated Palestine, and soon after to Cairo in Egypt. From there, Quwatli spent {{the bulk of his}} time traveling throughout <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world</b> and Europe serving as the virtual ambassador of the Syrian-Palestinian Congress.

5|$|Through {{his actions}} and speeches, {{and because he}} was able to symbolize the popular Arab will, Nasser {{inspired}} several nationalist revolutions in <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world.</b> He defined the politics of his generation and communicated directly with the public masses of <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world,</b> bypassing the various heads of states of those countries—an accomplishment not repeated by other Arab leaders. The extent of Nasser's centrality in the region made it a priority for incoming Arab nationalist heads of state to seek good relations with Egypt, in order to gain popular legitimacy from their own citizens.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Egyptian {{director}} Youssef Chahine {{produced the}} film El Nasser Salah El Dine ("Saladin The Victorious"), which intentionally drew parallels between Saladin, considered {{a hero in}} <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world,</b> and Nasser and his pan-Arabist policies. Nasser is played by Ahmed Zaki in Mohamed Fadel's 1996 Nasser 56. The film set the Egyptian box office record at the time, and focused on Nasser during the Suez Crisis. It is also considered a milestone in Egyptian and Arab cinema as the first film to dramatize {{the role of a}} modern-day Arab leader. Together with the 1999 Syrian biopic Gamal Abdel Nasser, the films marked the first biographical movies about contemporary public figures produced in <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>world.</b> He is portrayed by Amir Boutrous in the Netflix television series The Crown.|$|E
