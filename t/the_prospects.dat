5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), {{created a}} special project headed by Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. Compton's report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> of developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. For this report, he worked with Fermi on calculations of the critical mass of uranium-235. He also discussed <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> for uranium enrichment with Harold Urey.|$|E

5|$|I Corps' {{part in the}} Western Desert Campaign was brief. Its {{headquarters}} opened near Benghazi on 15 February 1941, replacing British XIII Corps. Rowell studied <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> of {{an advance}} on Tripoli, but the headquarters was recalled to Egypt on 24 February {{to participate in the}} Battle of Greece. Nonetheless, for his part, Rowell was mentioned in despatches, and appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, much of the {{attention}} was placed on the weather forecast and <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> of rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected pitches. In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance, especially if the team batting first had accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1920s, Victoria worried over <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> of her children. Maria, {{her eldest}} {{daughter}} married {{the head of}} one of Germany's mediatized families, Karl, Hereditary Prince of Leiningen on 25 November 1925, Victoria’s 49th birthday. Victoria was at her daughter's bedside when she gave birth to her first child, Emich Kirill, in 1926 (father of claimant to the Russian throne, Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen). She also attended the subsequent births of Maria's children.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>prospect</b> {{theory is}} one of the most popular {{decision-making}} theories. It is based on S-shaped utility functions, unlike the von Neumann and Morgenstern (NM) theory, which is based on concave utility functions. The S-shaped functions bring challenges, and extensions and generalizations of the NM theory into <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> theory are not always possible. For example, in <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> theory, <b>the</b> monotonicity of indifference curves depends on the underlying mean, unlike in the NM theory. Risk-hedging deci-sions also become more complex within <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> theory. In this paper, we discuss these topics and establish general results concerning certain covariances from which we can in turn infer properties of indifference curves and hedging decisions within <b>the</b> <b>prospect</b> theory. ...|$|R

In addition it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, KKR {{filed with}} the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise $1.25 billion by selling an {{ownership}} interest in its management company. The filing came {{less than two weeks}} after the initial public offering of rival private equity firm Blackstone Group. KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.|$|E

5|$|In {{the months}} after the {{announcement}} that applications were being sought for the second group of NASA astronauts, Armstrong {{became more and more}} excited about <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> of both the Apollo program and of investigating a new aeronautical environment. Armstrong's astronaut application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline. Dick Day, with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed. At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.|$|E

He attended the Air Corps Primary Flying School at Brooks Field, Texas, but suffered an attack of neuritis in his right arm, and his flight instructor, Lieutenant Claire Lee Chennault, failed him. In December 1927, he was offered a position as an instructor at the Naval War College, where he taught classes on World War I, and on joint operations.|$|E

5|$|Maxwell {{was born}} in the Sydney suburb of Forest Lodge, New South Wales, on 10 February 1896 to John Maxwell, a labourer, and his wife Elizabeth, née Stokes. A member of the Senior Australian Army Cadets for three years, he worked as an {{apprentice}} boilermaker at an engineering works near Newcastle upon leaving school. For two years, he served {{as a member of the}} Citizens Military Forces, and on 6 February 1915, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force enticed by <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> of better pay.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, at 01:00 on 15 December, the New Zealand Division—electing {{not to make}} {{a further}} frontal assault on Orsogna—launched their 5th Brigade in Operation Florence, a new {{flanking}} attack {{to the right of the}} village. By that afternoon, 5th Brigade was well established on the Orsogna to Ortona lateral road and had driven a shallow salient into the German forward defensive line. Although they had exhausted nearly all their reserves, divisional headquarters was optimistic for <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> for the next day, given the heavy casualties they had inflicted that day.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} {{affected the}} quantity and quality of his forces. Many of his men's enlistments were due to expire before Christmas, and many soldiers were inclined to leave the army when their commission ended. Several deserted before their enlistments were up. The pending loss of forces, the series of lost battles, the loss of New York, the flight of the Army along with many New Yorkers and the Second Continental Congress to Philadelphia, left many in doubt about <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> of winning the war. But Washington persisted. He successfully procured supplies and dispatched men to recruit new members of the militia, which was successful in part due to British and Hessian mistreatment of New Jersey and Pennsylvania residents.|$|E

5|$|The Lithuanian {{government}} in Kaunas, which viewed {{the city as}} the historic capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, saw the Polish incursion as an occupation. The Lithuanian government demanded Vilnius back. Relations between the Polish and Lithuanian governments, unable to reach a compromise over Vilnius, continued to worsen, destroying <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> for Piłsudski's plan of the Międzymorze federation and leading to open hostilities in the ensuing Polish–Lithuanian War. In 1920, the Soviets recaptured Vilnius, followed by the Poles' establishment of the short-lived Republic of Central Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|This {{still left}} {{the problem of}} getting {{government}} support for uranium research. Another friend of Szilárd's, the Austrian economist Gustav Stolper, suggested approaching Alexander Sachs, who had access to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sachs told Szilárd that he had already spoken to the President about uranium, but that Fermi and Pegram had reported that <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> for building an atomic bomb were remote. He told Szilárd that he would deliver the letter, but suggested that it come from someone more prestigious. For Szilárd, Einstein was again the obvious choice. Sachs and Szilárd drafted a letter riddled with spelling errors and mailed it to Einstein.|$|E
5|$|Traffic on the opened {{section was}} {{much lower than}} anticipated, and <b>the</b> <b>prospects</b> of {{building}} {{the rest of the}} canal dwindled, as profits were minimal. However, in 1829 James Green {{turned his attention to the}} link to Taunton. He had been the architect of the Bude Canal, which was built for tub-boats and used inclined planes to change levels, and proposed a similar solution here. The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal had opened in 1827, making navigation from Taunton to Bridgwater easier than on the River Tone. In a report of 1830, Green proposed using vertical lifts instead of inclined planes, and estimated the cost of the canal at £65,000.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{algorithms}} solving the on-line Bin-Covering problem, when the items are generated from a known, stationary distribution. We introduce <b>the</b> <b>Prospect</b> Algorithm. <b>The</b> main idea behind <b>the</b> <b>Prospect</b> Algorithm {{is to use}} information on the item distribution to estimate how easy {{it will be to}} fill a bin with small overfill {{as a function of the}} empty space left in it. This estimate is then used to determine where to place the items, so that all active bins either stay easily fillable, or are finished with small overfill. We test the performance of the algorithm by simulation, and discuss how it can be modified to cope with additional constraints and extended to solve the Bin-Packing problem as well. <b>The</b> <b>Prospect</b> Algorithm is then adapted to achieve perfect packing, yielding a new version, the Prospect+ Algorithm, that is a slight but consistent improvement. Next, a Markov Decision Process formulation is used to obtain an optimal Bin-Covering algorithm to compare with <b>the</b> <b>Prospect</b> Algorithm. Even though the optimal algorithm can only be applied to limited (small) cases, it gives useful insights that lead to another modification of <b>the</b> <b>Prospect</b> Algorithm. We also discuss two relaxations of the on-line constraint, and describe how algorithms that are based on solving the Subset-Sum problem are used to tackle these relaxed problems. Finally, several practical issues encountered when using <b>the</b> <b>Prospect</b> Algorithm in <b>the</b> real-world are analyzed, a computationally efficient way of doing the background calculations needed for <b>the</b> <b>Prospect</b> Algorithm is described, and the three versions of <b>the</b> <b>Prospect</b> Algorithm developed in this thesis are compared.
