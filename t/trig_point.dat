50|$|Erecting new <b>trig</b> <b>points</b> {{and making}} {{measurements}} frequently required materials and instruments {{to be carried}} on foot, up hills and mountains and to isolated islands, {{in all kinds of}} weather. The network of <b>trig</b> <b>points</b> was built and measured between 1936 and 1962, starting with a set of several hundred primary <b>trig</b> <b>points,</b> most of which were placed on high hills so as to be able to link to one another across long distances. In addition, a larger set of roughly six thousand secondary <b>trig</b> <b>points</b> were added to allow the construction of a finer mesh that extended the reference frame of the primary mesh over shorter distances.|$|R

25|$|The {{geography}} of Broadclough {{is central to}} the settlements development. It being a three sided valley which is cut through at the north east end by the River Irwell which runs the length of Broadclough. There is a <b>trig</b> <b>point</b> on the summit of Brex Height above Broadclough which marks the extent of the village's hinterland to the west. The <b>Trig</b> <b>Point</b> pillar built in May 1948 and was last maintained by the OS in October 1979. Brex Height is also the 12th highest summit in the West Pennines at 409m (1342ft).|$|E
25|$|The {{summit is}} crowned by a tumulus whose stones have been raided to produce several small {{circular}} wind-shelters. There {{is also a}} modern cairn atop the tumulus and a <b>trig</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In the United Kingdom, trigpointing is a {{recreational}} activity similar to benchmarking. Searching for <b>trig</b> <b>points</b> is {{more popular than}} hunting benchmarks in the UK, {{but there is a}} considerable overlap in participation. [...] "Trig points" [...] is the common name for [...] "triangulation pillars". These are concrete pillars, about 4 feet tall, which were used by the Ordnance Survey {{in order to determine the}} exact shape of the country in a project known as the retriangulation of Great Britain, which was carried out from 1936 to 1962. They are generally located on the highest bit of ground in the area, so that there is a direct line of sight from one to the next. By setting a theodolite on the top of the pillar, accurate bearings to nearby <b>trig</b> <b>points</b> could be taken. This process is called triangulation.|$|R
50|$|In 1935 {{he started}} the retriangulation of Great Britain, an immense task which {{involved}} erecting concrete triangulation pillars (<b>trig</b> <b>points)</b> on prominent (often inaccessible) hilltops throughout Britain. As well as being an immense physical task, {{it was also an}} extremely complex mathematical undertaking. MacLeod can fairly be said to be the creator of the Ordnance Survey in its modern form.|$|R

50|$|The re{{triangulation}} of Great Britain was a triangulation project {{which involved}} erecting concrete pillars (<b>trig</b> <b>points)</b> on prominent hilltops throughout Great Britain, then computing their relative positions {{to the best}} possible accuracy and using this information {{to create a new}} basis for Britain's mapping system. The aim was to replace the original triangulation of Britain, known as the Principal Triangulation, which had been performed between 1783 and 1853, with a more modern and accurate triangulation.|$|R
50|$|On {{the south}} summit, near the viewing point, a Nagel Column (Nagelsche Säule) has stood since 1865. It recalls August Nagel, {{the head of}} survey in Saxony in the 19th century.

25|$|In {{addition}} to {{the determination of the}} precise location of the trigonometric points the Survey established the precise altitude of a number of fundamental benchmarks by spirit levelling over the years 1839 to 1860. This height survey was completely independent of the position survey, in contrast to modern GPS fixes which give both. The report of the levelling in Ireland had been published in 1855, and it fell to Clarke to prepare the reports for England and Scotland. For England this involved a least squares analysis for the 62 lines of primary levelling with 91 fundamental benchmarks at the end points and at points of intersection. The reference level was the height of Mean Water at Liverpool. 32 end points were connected to tidal stations and therefore the variation of mean water around the country was fixed. The benchmarking proceeded along the roads, but side lines were taken to, and over, many of the mountain top trig points, from which other <b>trig</b> <b>point</b> altitudes were measured by trigonometric levelling. The reports were published in 1861. Unlike the Principal Triangulation report no theory was included in Clarke's levelling reports.|$|E

50|$|The Brendon Hills are a {{range of}} hills in west Somerset, England. The hills merge level into {{the eastern side of}} Exmoor and are {{included}} within the Exmoor National Park. The highest point of the range is Lype Hill at 1388 ft above sea level with a secondary summit several kilometres to the southeast at 1350 ft. Both points are marked by Ordnance Survey <b>trig</b> <b>points</b> and are located within enclosed farmland. Early versions of the name include Brunedun and Brundon reflecting an original name of Bruna or Brune, meaning 'brown one'. Dun is a common Old English word for a fairly flat and extensive hill. This name is not connected with the village of Brendon in Devon, the name of which has a different origin.|$|R
50|$|The {{calculations}} were constrained; it {{was hoped}} to minimise the shifts from the coordinates based on the old triangulation. At eleven primary <b>trig</b> <b>points</b> from Dunnose on the Isle of Wight (456784 m E, 080150 m N) north to Great Whernside in Yorkshire (400202 E, 473904 N) the new lat-lons were adjusted to stay within a metre of the old ones. Once the new Latitude and Longitude of those eleven points were fixed the calculated location of every other point in the triangulation was based on them. By the time the retriangulation was completed, electronic distance-measuring devices had come into use which could have greatly reduced the overall error (it now seems Great Britain is 20+ metres shorter than OSGB36 implies) but starting over from scratch {{was out of the}} question.|$|R
5000|$|Triangulation points, {{also known}} as <b>trig</b> <b>points,</b> are marks with a {{precisely}} established horizontal position. These points may be marked by disks similar to benchmark disks, but set horizontally, and are also sometimes used as elevation benchmarks. Prominent features on buildings such as {{the tip of a}} church spire or a chimney stack are also used as reference points for triangulation. In the United Kingdom triangulation points are often set in large concrete markers that, as well as functioning as triangulation points, have a benchmark set into the side. With the increasing use of GPS and electronic distance measuring devices, the same techniques and equipment are used to fix the horizontal and vertical position of a survey marker at the same moment, and therefore the marks are usually regarded as [...] "fixed in three dimensions".|$|R
