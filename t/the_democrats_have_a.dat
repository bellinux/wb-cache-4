30|$|The main {{pattern is}} that the whole {{electorate}} in Argentina {{seems to be on}} the left of the political spectrum, as most people seem to believe that poverty is the result of luck (or that society treats them unfairly) rather than laziness. However, in relative terms the Peronists seem to exhibit a pattern closer to the one of the Republicans instead of the democrats. Indeed, the biggest proportion of believers in laziness as a source of poverty takes place amongst Peronists and the Republicans. The ratio of believers in Laziness (39 %) to believers in an unfair society (61 %) in the Peronist sub-sample is 0.64, whereas amongst non-Peronists it is 20 – 80 %, for a ratio of 0.25. On the other hand, the percentage of believers in laziness (unfair society) amongst the democrats is 49 % (51 % respectively), whereas amongst the Republicans is much higher 75 – 25 %. Focusing on the ratios of laziness to unfairness, <b>the</b> <b>democrats</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> ratio of 0.96, whereas that for the Republicans is 3.|$|E

50|$|After {{being elected}} on the Democratic ticket in 1897 to the Virginia House of Delegates, Walker served one full two-year term, {{representing}} Northumberland and Westmoreland counties. As was typical {{in the late}} nineteenth to early twentieth century, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> overwhelming majority in the state's legislature.|$|R

50|$|All totaled, the Republicans <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{net gain}} of two seats (giving them 31 total), <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{net loss of}} three seats (leaving them with 18 total), and an {{independent}} picked up one seat. Due to no candidate receiving 50% of the vote, the Vermont General Assembly cast their votes for governor in January 2015, re-electing Governor Peter Shumlin.|$|R
25|$|Although studies {{indicate}} Democrats {{tend to be}} more supportive of a single-payer system than Republicans, none of the reform bills debated in the U.S. Congress when <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> majority from 2007–2010, included proposals to implement a single payer health care system. Advocates argue that the largest obstacle to single-payer, universal system in the U.S. is a lack of political will.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> 16-14 {{majority}} in the Oregon State Senate in the previous session. 16 of the 30 senate seats were up for election. In the Oregon House of Representatives, which was evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, all 60 seats were up for election.

25|$|In Delaware County, with <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> record 59,500 {{registered}} voters and Kennedy's strong appeal, Nixon carried the county by only 135,672 to 124,629. With some ticket-splitting, Milliken's plurality was {{slightly larger than}} Nixon's, 136,021 to 120,839, but the outcome of one legislative district, where Kennedy had carried {{four of the six}} towns, was in doubt until all absentee ballots were counted. Only then could incumbent Republican state representatives Clyde Dengler and Mae Kernaghan be declared the victors.|$|R

50|$|Democrats {{gained a}} total of 52 seats in the 1930 election. Although the Republicans {{retained}} a narrow majority after the polls closed, they lost a number of special elections following the deaths of 19 representatives and representatives-elect prior to the reconvening of Congress. This resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> one-seat majority {{at the opening of}} the legislature, which then rose to a four-seat majority after the first month of the session. The Republicans would not control the chamber again until 1946.|$|R
5000|$|Despite Polk's victory, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{net loss}} of six Representatives. They still {{retained}} {{a large majority of}} 142-79 over their major rivals, the Whigs. The American Party, based on the nativist [...] "Know Nothing" [...] movement characterized by opposition to immigration and anti-Catholicism, gained six seats, its first in Congress. The fragmentation of votes by this new party, combined with a generally negative political environment cause by dislike of outgoing President John Tyler, contributed to the slight Democratic loses.|$|R
50|$|English {{was elected}} to the House of Representatives in 1994 after seven-term {{incumbent}} Tom Ridge vacated the seat to make a successful run for Governor. English benefited from the Republican wave of 1994 as well as Ridge's coattails. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> crowded primary in which the Erie candidates split the vote, which allowed Sharon attorney Bill Leavens to win the primary. English, as a native of Erie, then garnered enough support from his hometown (generally a Democratic stronghold) to win the election.|$|R
5000|$|Following the July 25 primary Riley {{surprised}} everyone {{when she}} {{announced that she}} was switching parties to become a Democrat. Before she switched parties <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> slim one seat margin in the Senate, illustrating the importance of her move. She felt that moderates like herself were no longer relevant in the Republican party, although many say personality conflicts with the Party were more important. The driving force in my decision {{is that no one}} in leadership is listening to moderates in the Oklahoma Republican Party.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout the war, Illinois {{politics}} {{were dominated by}} Republicans under the energetic leadership of Governor Richard Yates and Senators Lyman Trumbull and Orville H. Browning. Democrats scored major gains in the 1862 election by attacking Lincoln's emancipation plan as danger to the state since it would bring in thousands of freed slaves. [...] <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> majority in <b>the</b> legislature and in 1863, Browning's Senate seat, formerly held by Douglas prior to the war, was filled by <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> with <b>the</b> election of William Alexander Richardson.|$|R
5000|$|In the 110th Congress, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> 51-49 {{majority}} in the Senate, and no longer needed to filibuster nominees. Thus {{the purpose of the}} Gang of 14 disappeared. President Bush attempted to reconcile with <b>the</b> Senate <b>Democrats</b> by not renominating Boyle, Myers, and Haynes in January 2007. [...] As the new majority party, <b>the</b> Senate <b>Democrats</b> easily blocked several conservative appellate judicial nominees during the 110th Congress by ordinary methods. Conservative appellate nominees like Peter Keisler, Robert J. Conrad and Steve A. Matthews were blocked in committee and never given a hearing.|$|R
50|$|The {{party was}} founded in 2002, chiefly by {{former members of the}} Progress Party led by Vidar Kleppe. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> conservative, national-oriented profile; key issues are {{opposition}} to immigration and Islamic influence, opposition to the European Union (including Schengen and the EEA), and tougher law and order measures. In economic issues it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> more centrist profile, calling for raising the minimal state pension, care pay for homemakers, as well as opposition to taxes on cars and toll stations. It considers its values to be based on Christianity and Norwegian heritage.|$|R

50|$|Parker {{had almost}} 9,000 fewer votes than Musgrove. However, {{due to the}} {{presence}} of two minor candidates, Musgrove came up a few thousand votes short of a majority. Under an 1890 law, the first tiebreaker was whoever won the most state electoral votes (based on state House of Representatives districts). Each candidate won 61 of the 122 state electoral votes. The election was thus decided by the Mississippi House of Representatives, where <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> supermajority at <b>the</b> time. However, Parker refused to concede, and the House elected Musgrove 86-36 along partisan lines.|$|R
25|$|Democrat Party's {{candidate}} Apirak Kosayothin won the 2004 Bangkok gubernatorial election; the TRT Party did not {{submit a}} candidate. <b>The</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party lost further ground to Thai Rak Thai in the 2005 general election. In the election campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> populist platform, promoting job creation, universal {{education and health}} care, and law and order against crime and corruption. The party aimed to gain 201 seats, enough to launch a vote of a no confidence debate against the premier. They won 96 out of 500 seats and 18.3% of the popular vote. The party's leader, Banyat Bantadtan, resigned after the election.|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} Zachary Taylor was made {{almost out of}} desperation; he was not clearly {{committed}} to Whig principles, but he was popular for leading the war effort. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> record of victory, prosperity, and the acquisition of both Oregon and the Southwest. It appeared almost certain that they would win unless the Whigs picked Taylor. His victory {{made him one of}} only two Whigs to be elected president before the party ceased to exist in the 1850s; the other was William Henry Harrison, who <b>had</b> also been <b>a</b> general and war hero, but died a month after assuming office.|$|R
50|$|In the 1999 gubernatorial {{election}} Parker {{had almost}} 9,000 fewer votes than his Democratic opponent, Lieutenant Governor Ronnie Musgrove. However, {{due to the}} presence of two minor candidates, Musgrove came up a few thousand votes short of a majority. Under an 1890 law, the first tiebreaker was whoever won the most state electoral votes, based on state house districts. Each candidate carried 61 of the 122 state house districts. The election was thus decided by the Mississippi House of Representatives, where <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> supermajority at <b>the</b> time.

50|$|In 1976 Danforth ran {{to succeed}} Symington, who was retiring. Danforth {{ran in the}} Republican primary with little opposition. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{three-way}} battle among Symington's son James W. Symington, former Missouri Governor Warren Hearnes and rising political star Congressman Jerry Litton. Litton and his entire family were killed when the plane taking them to their victory party in Kansas City crashed on take off in Chillicothe, Missouri. Hearnes, who had {{finished second in the}} primary far behind Litton, was appointed to challenge Danforth. Danforth easily won even though Jimmy Carter of Georgia won Missouri in the presidential election.|$|R
5000|$|Governor of Washington, between Dino Rossi and Christine Gregoire. Issues raised {{included}} the mailing of absentee ballots, the counting of provisional and absentee ballots, correction of improper marks on optically scanned ballots, and alleged tampering with electronic voting machines. The first tally {{and the first}} recount gave the election to Republican Dino Rossi. However, after two statewide recounts, Gregoire, <b>the</b> <b>Democrat,</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> narrow lead of 129 votes out of 2.8 million cast. A Republican lawsuit seeking to overturn the result and force a re-vote {{was rejected by the}} court, after which Rossi conceded the election. See Washington gubernatorial election, 2004.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good night, taking seats {{from the}} Conservatives in Balsham, Cottenham and Melbourn and from independents in Fulbourn and Histon and Impington. Conservatives however gained a seat from <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> in <b>the</b> Shelfords and Stapleford.|$|R
25|$|The Conservative {{majority}} {{on the council}} was increased by one seat after gaining three seats, but also losing two seats. Both Labour and <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> net loss of one seat, while Sheppey First gained a seat.|$|R
5|$|For Register of Wills, as for City Controller, the Republicans <b>had</b> <b>a</b> primary {{fight between}} the Hamilton-Meade regulars and the Meehan faction. As in that contest, the regulars were victorious, nominating Robert C. Duffy, {{attorney}} and former football star, with 67,283 votes. In second came Meehan's man, Morris J. Root, with 42,977, and William P. Shermer, an independent candidate, with 8,909. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> easier time nominating former Congressman Francis R. Smith, who trounced Joseph F. Amodie, 40,582 to 5,470. The general election contest {{was one of}} the closest on the ballot but the Republican, Duffy, still defeated <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> by more than 7,500 votes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{composition}} of the Senate was affected by the decision in 1987 as to which Senators received a long term, with Labor and <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> voting to reject the alternate [...] "recount" [...] method that had been unanimously recommended by the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform in 1983, and facilitated by the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Thus the Labor government, with only 32 seats, needed 7 additional votes to achieve the majority necessary to pass legislation. Because <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> got 2 additional long vacancies in 1987, in South Australia and New South Wales, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> total of 8 seats from 1990 and thus continued to hold the balance of power, even after Janet Powell resigned from <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> in 1992.|$|R
50|$|The Lieutenant Governor is President of the (state) Senate and {{presides over}} that body, only voting {{to break a}} tie. Compared to the {{lieutenant}} governors in other states, Mississippi's <b>has</b> <b>a</b> great deal of power concerning the state Senate. The Lieutenant Governor has the sole ability to appoint members, vice-chairmen, and chairmen to the various Senate committees, regardless of each party's strength in the chamber. For example, former Lt. Gov. Amy Tuck, a Republican, appointed other Republicans to the chairmanships of some committees, even though <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> four-seat majority. Given that power, {{it is argued that}} the office is more powerful than the governorship.|$|R
5000|$|Don Mueang <b>has</b> been <b>a</b> stronghold for the Pheu Thai Party (and its predecessors, Thai Rak Thai Party and People's Power Party), {{winning in}} every general and gubernatorial {{elections}} after the 2006 coup {{and is considered}} a [...] "deep red" [...] district. The last time <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> MP in <b>the</b> constituency was in 1976. However in the late-2012, Kanoknuch Naksuwanpha, a Democrat and a long-time local politician, won an upset election to secure her seat on the city council. It is believed that the reason she won was because of her long ties with Don Mueang as she built her political base {{in the area for}} decades.|$|R
5000|$|Archibald Williams {{was elected}} to the Illinois state Constitutional Convention of 1847 as a Whig. The {{convention}} met in the state capitol in Springfield, Illinois, and proceeded to write an improved state constitution. Williams was elected in a Democratic district against a Democratic candidate. Although <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> majority of <b>the</b> delegates to the convention, the Whigs could break away Democratic votes when they needed them and ended up dominating the convention. A historian noted: [...] "James W. Singleton of Mount Sterling, Archibald Williams of Quincy, and David M. Woodson of Carrollton aggressively upheld the Whig cause against the attacks of various capable Democratic opponents." ...|$|R
50|$|State Senator Darrel Aubertine, who {{represents}} {{most of the}} northern portion of the congressional district, was the most widely rumored potential Democratic candidate, but he declined. State Senator David Valesky, {{who represents}} most of the southern portion of the congressional district, initially said {{he was interested in}} running, but later decided against it. It was reported that the Democratic party leaders hesitated to nominate either Valesky or Aubertine because <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> shaky two-seat majority in the State Senate. Aubertine and Valesky are two of only seven <b>Democrats</b> in <b>the</b> chamber from outside New York City. Also declining to run was assemblywoman Addie Jenne Russell, whose district includes Watertown.|$|R
