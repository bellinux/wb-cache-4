5|$|Family {{tensions}} {{play out}} on the highway and at stops along the way, amidst the aging VW van's mechanical problems. When <b>the</b> <b>van</b> breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push <b>the</b> <b>van</b> until it is moving at about 20mph before it is put into gear, at which point they have to run up to the side door and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself.|$|E
5|$|For {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of <b>The</b> <b>Van,</b> Doyle and Myles formed their own production company, Deadly Films, {{and the author}} was given creative control over the selection of its cast and director. Frears returned as director, and Meaney was cast in the lead role. Although <b>The</b> <b>Van</b> (1996) premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival to some favorable reviews, critical reaction was negative upon release; reviewers criticized the film for its thin material and lack of strong characterization.|$|E

Kate informs Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) of all she knows about the Others and then leaves, saying she's going to get help to rescue Jack, but she won't say from whom.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{changes to}} the drivetrain, body, and {{suspension}} were made after 1993, as Dodge tried to make <b>the</b> <b>vans</b> more competitive, leading to a fairly sizeable redesign in 1998, which added numerous features, made <b>the</b> <b>vans</b> more driveable and safer, and added power to the 5.9 L V8 engine. More, and also substantial, changes were made for the 2000 model year, but little was changed from then until <b>the</b> final <b>vans.</b> Dodge stopped making <b>the</b> <b>vans</b> in June 2003, citing the expense of meeting future safety standards and slow sales. The Pillette Road plant in Windsor, Ontario which made <b>the</b> <b>vans</b> was closed down and later demolished.|$|R

5|$|One of the episode's scenes {{involves}} an infected woman {{jumping out of}} the building onto a van in an attempt to spread the virus further. To simulate her 160-feet fall, stuntwoman Angela Uyeda was placed in a crane 10 to 15 feet above <b>the</b> <b>van</b> and asked to jump onto <b>the</b> <b>van</b> below. The crew removed the roof structure on <b>the</b> <b>van,</b> and carefully rigged it to cave-in upon impact but also make it as painless as possible for Uyeda. To achieve this, they modified the ribs that supported the roof by placing them on pins that would snap, and also added a three-millimeter glass plate that would snap between two sheets of black hard nylon-type plastic to further emphasize the distance she jumped.|$|E
50|$|Production <b>vans</b> test: During <b>the</b> Cartier test, {{production}} vans {{were parked}} outside the Chateau de Rochegude, {{where the other}} players wait for their next mission. <b>The</b> <b>vans</b> were purposely unlocked and the crew was secretly filming on the roof {{to see if anyone}} would look into <b>the</b> <b>vans.</b> No penalties were at stake. Afi, Jennifer, Jim, Steven, and Wendi did not bother to look in <b>the</b> <b>vans.</b> However, Charlie was caught investigating, raising suspicion.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>vans</b> {{hung around}} {{for about six}} years {{following}} the cancellation of corpse trains, until they were finally withdrawn in 1949; at this time the electric through-cabling gear was removed, and <b>the</b> <b>vans</b> were scrapped or sold in 1953.|$|R
50|$|Like <b>the</b> ZP <b>vans</b> before them, {{twenty of}} the ZL fleet were {{upgraded}} in 1971 by adding three tons of rail and a false floor. <b>The</b> <b>vans</b> were coded ZB, possibly indicating a planned use on ballast trains where constant stopping and starting could have created derailment risks. <b>The</b> <b>vans</b> were numbered 1 through 20, previously ZL van bodies 552, 348, 528, 427, 574, 452, 378, 308, 472, 317, 434, 405, 224, 393, 226, 463, 288, 481, 232 and 457 respectively. <b>The</b> <b>vans</b> {{were not considered}} particularly useful, with the first withdrawn in 1973 and none lasting beyond 1984.|$|R

50|$|In 2010, {{according}} to the Daily Telegraph, the Queensland government released a report saying 90% of Wicked <b>vans</b> in <b>the</b> state were unroadworthy.

5|$|The {{positioning}} of these figures closely {{resembles that of}} two persons depicted in <b>the</b> <b>van</b> Eyck panel. In that painting the right-hand figure turns to face his companion, gesturing at him to look outwards. In <b>the</b> <b>van</b> der Weyden, the equivalent figure seems protective of his friend, who here is female, while the left-hand figure in the earlier panel might represent {{a tribute to the}} artist's brother Hubert who had died in the 1420s. A red headdress was an indicator of self-portraiture for van Eyck. As in <b>the</b> <b>van</b> Eyck, the figures act as examples of repoussoir, in that they draw our attention to the picture's underlying theme – the painting's ability to visualize the infinity of the world in the landscape. The painting may allude to the concept of paragone; the man points to the landscape, perhaps highlighting the ability of painting, unlike sculpture, to supply its foreground with background.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Corgan reading {{a comic book}} dressed in an ice cream man uniform. A clip of the intro to the song is played and stopped {{repeatedly}} before the song begins. Groups {{of two or more}} people are kissing each other around Corgan as he drives in an ice cream van through a desert. Corgan picks up a dress-wearing Iha and the two drive for a while before stopping at a gas station, where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants. After Iha changes into a yellow and white cowboy outfit, the band paints <b>the</b> <b>van</b> in a multitude of colors. More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from the gas station in <b>the</b> <b>van.</b> However, Corgan is ultimately kicked out of <b>the</b> <b>van,</b> and the video ends with Corgan walking off the road wearing a cowboy hat as <b>the</b> <b>van</b> drives away. The video was filmed on August 29, 1993.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the system}} began in May 1998. The {{majority}} {{of the system}} was built one span at a time, with cranes mounted on temporary structures erecting new spans as they progressed along the structures. However, some sections were built using a balanced cantilever design, where spans were first built {{on their own and}} then connected to each other using the span-by-span method. The fact that the Jamaica branch had to be built in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>Van</b> Wyck Expressway, combined with the varying length and curves of the track spans, caused complications during construction. One lane in each direction was closed during the off-peak hours, causing congestion on <b>the</b> <b>Van</b> Wyck.|$|E

The corpse is revealed as that of a servant when Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by <b>the</b> <b>Van</b> Garretts, who then sold it to <b>the</b> <b>Van</b> Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, {{in order to be able}} to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates.|$|E

5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, <b>the</b> <b>van</b> was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any sound from the vehicle. However, every time <b>the</b> <b>van</b> was pushed it would stall or the timing would be off. Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in the hatch, the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food though, he would sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into a garbage can. The chicken head that Bose had to wear was extremely heavy, causing actor Daniel Dae Kim to have to hold it up while Bose delivered his lines.|$|E
