5|$|In {{some parts}} of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of {{recorded}} history {{right up to the}} present day, there {{does not seem to have}} been an hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, but in these places there is no sign of a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with no access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.|$|E

5|$|The {{injustice}} {{which has}} been done to our author's works, in estimating their poetical merit, rendered us doubly anxious, on opening his last volume, to find it likely to seize fast hold of general sympathy, and thus turn an overwhelming power against the paltry traducers of talent, more eminently promising in many respects, than any the present age has been called upon to encourage. We have not found it to be quite all that we wished in this respect--and {{it would have been very}} extraordinary if we had, for our wishes went far beyond reasonable expectations. But we have found it of a nature to present to common understandings the poetical power with which the author's mind is gifted, in a more tangible and intelligible shape than that in which it has appeared in any of his former compositions. It is, therefore, calculated to throw shame on the lying, vulgar spirit, in which this young worshipper in the temple of the Muses has been cried-down; whatever questions may still leave to be settled as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> and degree of his poetical merits. Take for instance, as proof of the justice of our praise, the following passage from an Ode to the Nightingale:--it is distinct, noble, pathetic, and true: the thoughts have all chords of direct communication with naturally-constituted hearts: the echoes of the strain linger bout the depths of human bosoms.|$|E

25|$|Ervin Nyiregyh√°zi (January 19, 1903, BudapestApril 8, 1987, Los Angeles) was a Hungarian-born American {{pianist and}} composer.

25|$|In 1955, Matsumoto {{abandoned}} manga altogether. Although {{he continued}} to do illustration work {{in a variety of}} styles, his focus shifted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of hyper-stylized, wryly adorable character epitomized by the later Kurumi-chan. His target audience accordingly shifted from preteen and low-teen girls to toddlers and young mothers. In addition to illustrating new and original children's books, Matsumoto illustrated numerous classics, including Little Red Riding Hood (1955), Andrew Lang's Blue Fairy Book (1959, translated by Yasunari Kawabata), and various other collections of classic Japanese and European fairy tales.|$|E
25|$|In Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, the Supreme Court {{upheld a}} Minnesota law that {{temporarily}} restricted {{the ability of}} mortgage holders to foreclose. The law was enacted to prevent mass foreclosures during the Great Depression, a time of economic hardship in America. The kind of contract modification performed by the law in question was arguably similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> that the Framers intended to prohibit. The Supreme Court held that this law was a valid exercise of the state's police power. It found that the temporary nature of the contract modification and the emergency of the situation justified the law.|$|E

25|$|In modern {{solid-state}} physics, it {{is common}} to classify systems according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of degrees of freedom they have available, like electron (metals) or spin (magnetism). In crystals that can display the JTE, and before this effect is realised by symmetry-breaking distortions, it is found that there exists an orbital degree of freedom consisting of how electrons occupy the local degenerate orbitals. As initially discussed by Kugel and Khomskii, not all configurations are equivalent. The key is the relative orientation of these occupied orbital, {{in the same way that}} spin orientation is important in magnetic systems, and the ground state can only be realised for some particular orbital pattern. Both this pattern and the effect giving rise to this phenomenon is usually denominated orbital-ordering.|$|E
25|$|The visible {{graphical}} interface {{features of}} an application are {{sometimes referred to}} as chrome or GUI (pronounced gooey). Typically, users interact with information by manipulating visual widgets that allow for interactions appropriate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of data they hold. The widgets of a well-designed interface are selected to support the actions necessary to achieve the goals of users. A model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller allows a flexible structure in which the interface is independent from and indirectly linked to application functions, so the GUI can be customized easily. This allows users to select or design a different skin at will, and eases the designer's work to change the interface as user needs evolve. Good user interface design relates to users more, and to system architecture less.|$|E
25|$|The North Jamtish {{clothing}} part {{is typically}} {{influenced by the}} folk costumes of northern √Öngermanland {{and to a lesser}} degree Lapland, with the exception of Frostviken parish settled by Tr√∏nders in the 18th century. The East Jamtish part is the least old-fashioned of the three with many changes done to the costumes through time, making them closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> used at the Swedish coast, rather than the others in J√§mtland. The Great Jamtish part has typically old-fashioned and conservative homogeneous bunads with blue socks, red knitted caps among the males, dark bounded caps for ladies and coloured for girls. The skirts are usually of a single colour and the men have blue or black hodden coats, with yellow chamois leather pants made from moose skin.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{considers}} {{how teachers}} {{can make a}} difference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of literacy young people take up. Increasingly, researchers and policy-makers see literacy as an ensemble of socio-cultural situated practices rather than as a unitary skill. Accordingly, the differences in what young people come to do with literacy, in and out of school, confront us more directly. If literacy development involves assembling dynamic repertoires of practices, it is crucial to consider what different groups of children growing up and going to school in different places have access to and make investments in over time; <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of literate communities from which some are excluded or included; and how educators make a difference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> of literate trajectories and identities young people put together...|$|R

25|$|There {{is little}} direct {{evidence}} as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> {{and amount of}} knowledge which Pythagoras acquired, or as to his definite philosophical views. Everything of the kind mentioned by Plato and Aristotle is attributed not to Pythagoras, but to the Pythagoreans. Heraclitus stated {{that he was a}} man of extensive learning; and Xenophanes claimed that he believed in the transmigration of souls. Xenophanes mentions the story of his interceding on behalf of a dog that was being beaten, professing to recognise in its cries the voice of a departed friend. Pythagoras is supposed to have claimed that he had been Euphorbus, the son of Panthus, in the Trojan war, as well as various other characters, a tradesman, a courtesan, etc. In his book The Life of Apollonius of Tyana, Philostratus wrote that Pythagoras knew not only who he was himself, but also who he had been.|$|E
25|$|Singapore {{was once}} the {{powerhouse}} of sophisticated Malay cultural production, until Kuala Lumpur took over in the 1970s. Although usually thought of as an essentially Chinese city, Singapore was nevertheless a Malay city. Contrary to the stereotype, Malays were the most urbanised of the island's three main races, {{and there was no}} such concentration of urbanised Malays anywhere else in the Malay world. Here were produced a high proportion of the modernist Malay writings, including novels and newspapers, that generated Malay nationalism. The emergence of Singapore-Malay community was added to by intermarriage with Arabs, Indian Muslims and Peninsula Malays immigrants, as well as the adoption of Chinese babies. In other words, Singapore's Malayness was a creolised culture, closer in character to the Pesisir (coastal) Malay culture that had developed elsewhere in the archipelago than <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of Malayness that characterised the Malay world proper of Peninsula and Sumatra. In Singapore itself, assimilation to Malayness was and is purely cultural, with no guiding hand to police it.|$|E
