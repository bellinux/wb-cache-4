50|$|<b>Tiospirone</b> (BMY-13,859), also {{sometimes}} called tiaspirone or tiosperone, is an atypical antipsychotic of the azapirone class. It was investigated {{as a treatment}} for schizophrenia in the late 1980s and was found to have an effectiveness equivalent to those of typical antipsychotics in clinical trials but without causing extrapyramidal side effects. However, development was halted and it was not marketed. Perospirone, another azapirone derivative with antipsychotic properties, was synthesized and assayed several years after <b>tiospirone.</b> It was found to be both more potent and more selective in comparison and was commercialized instead.|$|E
50|$|The anxiolytics {{are also}} {{classified}} as azapirones {{due to the}} azaspirodecanedione moiety in their structures. 1-PP is a common metabolite of {{most or all of}} the listed agents. Alnespirone, binospirone, and enilospirone, despite being azapirones, are not piperazines and therefore do not metabolize to 1-PP, and while perospirone and <b>tiospirone</b> are piperazines, they are instead benzothiazole-substituted piperazines and do not metabolize to 1-PP either.|$|E
50|$|While {{some of the}} listed {{properties}} such as 5-HT2A and D2 blockade may {{be useful}} in certain indications such as in the treatment of schizophrenia (as with perospirone and <b>tiospirone),</b> all of them except 5-HT1A agonism are generally undesirable in anxiolytics and only contribute to side effects. As a result, further development has commenced to bring more selective of anxiolytic agents to the market. An example of this initiative is gepirone, which is currently in clinical trials in the United States for the treatment of major depression and generalized anxiety disorder. Another example is tandospirone which has been licensed in Japan for the treatment of anxiety and as an augmentation to antidepressants for depression.|$|E
40|$|Pigeons {{were trained}} to {{discriminate}} intramuscular injections of 5. 6 mg/kg BMY 14802, a drug that has relatively high affinity for sigma binding sites, from saline in a two-key operant proce-dure. Many compounds that displace sigma binding failed to produce BMY 14802 -like discriminative stimulus effects; these included (1) -SKF 10, 047, (1) 3 -PPP, DTG and MR 2035; the typical antipsychotic haloperidol; the putative antipsychotics <b>tiospirone,</b> cinuperone and rimcazole; and the uncompetitive NMDA antagonist phencyclidine. In addition, MR 2035 and tiosperone failed to antagonize the discriminative stimulus ef-fects of BMY 14802. The selective D 2 antagonist eticlopride and the norepinephrine uptake blocker and antidepressant desmethylimipramine also failed to evoke substantial BMY 14802 -appropriate responding.
