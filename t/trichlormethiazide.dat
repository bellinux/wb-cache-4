50|$|Diuretics, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} ‘water pills’, are drugs which draw excess fluid from the tissues {{of the body}} and convert it into urine. They are used for the swelling and bloating of premenstrual syndrome, for treating high blood pressure and, in older people, for heart failure caused by weakening of the heart’s pumping mechanism. Diuretics are used to pass drug test because they increase the amount of urine produced by the body. By increasing the amount of urine, it dilutes any drugs in the urine, which makes it harder to identify drugs. Examples of diuretics and masking agents are: bumetanide, chlorothiazide, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, probenecid, spironolactone (canrenone), triameterene, and <b>trichlormethiazide.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Trichlormethiazide,</b> a thiazide diuretic, was {{introduced}} in 1960 and {{remains one of the}} most frequently used diuretics for treating hypertension in Japan. While numerous clinical trials have indicated important side effects of thiazides, e. g., adverse effects on electrolytes and uric acid, very few data exist on serum electrolyte levels in patients with <b>trichlormethiazide</b> treatment. We performed a retrospective cohort study to assess the adverse effects of <b>trichlormethiazide,</b> focusing on serum electrolyte and uric acid levels. Methods We used data from the Clinical Data Warehouse of Nihon University School of Medicine obtained between Nov 1, 2004 and July 31, 2010, to identify cohorts of new <b>trichlormethiazide</b> users (n = 99 for 1 mg, n = 61 for 2 mg daily dosage) and an equal number of non-users (control). We used propensity-score matching to adjust for differences between users and control for each dosage, and compared serum chemical data including serum sodium, potassium, uric acid, creatinine and urea nitrogen. The mean exposure of <b>trichlormethiazide</b> of 1 mg and 2 mg users was 58 days and 64 days, respectively. Results The mean age was 66 years, and 55 % of <b>trichlormethiazide</b> users of the 1 mg dose were female. In <b>trichlormethiazide</b> users of the 2 mg dose, the mean age was 68 years, and 43 % of users were female. There were no statistically significant differences in all covariates (age, sex, comorbid diseases, past drugs, and current antihypertensive drugs) between <b>trichlormethiazide</b> users and controls for both doses. In <b>trichlormethiazide</b> users of the 2 mg dose, the reduction of serum potassium level and the elevation of serum uric acid level were significant compared with control, whereas changes of mean serum sodium, creatinine and urea nitrogen levels were not significant. In <b>trichlormethiazide</b> users of the 1 mg dose, all tests showed no statistically significant change from baseline to during the exposure period in comparison with control. Conclusions Our study showed adverse effects of decreased serum potassium and increased serum uric acid with <b>trichlormethiazide</b> treatment, and suggested that a lower dose of <b>trichlormethiazide</b> may minimize these adverse effects. These findings support the current trend in hypertension therapeutics to shift towards lower doses of thiazides. </p...|$|E

40|$|Characterization of Na+ {{transport}} {{across the}} cell membranes of the ascending thin limb of Henle's loop. In the ascending thin limb of Henle's loop (ATL), intracellular Na+ is extruded by Na+/K+ ATPase in the basolateral membrane. To further characterize Na+ transport across the cell membranes of the ATL, the intracellular sodium concentration ([Na+]i) was monitored using a sodium-sensitive fluorescent probe, SBFI, {{in the in}} vitro microperfused hamster ATL. Basal [Na+]i was 19. 0 ± 1. 2 mM (N = 24). Removal and replacement of luminal Na+ did not change [Na+]i {{in the presence of}} Na+ in the bathing fluid. In contrast, luminal Na+ removal reduced [Na+]i from 11. 6 ± 0. 9 to 6. 3 ± 0. 8 mM in the absence of peritubular Na+ (P < 0. 0005, N = 21). Replacement of luminal Na+ increased [Na+]i to 12. 6 ± 0. 9 mM. In the absence of Na+ in the bath, the addition of 1 µM benzamil, 0. 1 mM 5 -(N,N-dimethyl) -amiloride (DMA), 0. 1 mM furosemide, or 0. 1 mM <b>trichlormethiazide</b> to the lumen did not change [Na+]i or the rate of change in [Na+]i (d[Na+i/dt) after removal and replacement of luminal Na+.

In the absence of peritubular Na+, DMA in the bathing fluid decreased [Na+]i from 11. 4 ± 1. 3 to 6. 4 ± 1. 2 mM (P < 0. 01, N = 5) and completely inhibited the changes in [Na+]i after removal and replacement of luminal Na+. Removal of peritubular Na+ reduced [Na+]i from 18. 8 ± 1. 2 to 11. 3 ± 0. 7 mM (P < 0. 0001, N = 23). Addition of DMA in the bathing fluid reduced [Na+]i and inhibited the changes in [Na+]i after removal and replacement of peritubular Na+.

40|$|Much {{concern has}} arisen {{regarding}} critical {{adverse effects of}} thiazolidinediones (TZDs), including rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, on cardiac tissue. Although TZD-induced cardiac hypertrophy (CH) {{has been attributed to}} an increase in plasma volume or a change in cardiac nutrient preference, causative roles have not been established. To test the hypothesis that volume expansion directly mediates rosiglitazone-induced CH, mice were fed a high-fat diet with rosiglitazone, and cardiac and metabolic consequences were examined. Rosiglitazone treatment induced volume expansion and CH in wild-type and PPARγ heterozygous knockout (Pparg+/−) mice, but not in mice defective for ligand binding (PpargP 465 L/+). Cotreatment with the diuretic furosemide in wild-type mice attenuated rosiglitazone-induced CH, hypertrophic gene reprogramming, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, hypertrophy-related signal activation, and left ventricular dysfunction. Similar changes were observed in mice treated with pioglitazone. The diuretics spironolactone and <b>trichlormethiazide,</b> but not amiloride, attenuated rosiglitazone effects on volume expansion and CH. Interestingly, expression of glucose and lipid metabolism genes in the heart was altered by rosiglitazone, but these changes were not attenuated by furosemide cotreatment. Importantly, rosiglitazone-mediated whole-body metabolic improvements were not affected by furosemide cotreatment.

40|$|AbstractAllosteric {{modulators}} and mutations {{that slow}} AMPAR desensitization have additional effects on deactivation and agonist potency. We investigated whether these are independent actions or the natural consequence of slowing desensitization. Effects of cyclothiazide (CTZ), <b>trichlormethiazide</b> (TCM), and CX 614 were compared at wild-type GluR 1 and “nondesensitizing” GluR 1 -L 497 Y mutant receptors by patch-clamp recording with ultrafast perfusion. CTZ, TCM, or L/Y mutation all essentially blocked GluR 1 desensitization; however, {{the effects of}} L/Y mutation on deactivation and glutamate EC 50 were {{three to five times}} greater than for modulators. CTZ and TCM further slowed desensitization of L/Y mutant receptors but paradoxically accelerated deactivation and increased agonist EC 50. Results indicate that CTZ and TCM target deactivation and agonist potency independently of desensitization, most likely by modifying agonist dissociation (koff). Conversely, CX 614 slowed desensitization and deactivation without affecting EC 50 in both wild-type and L/Y receptors. The S 750 Q or combined L 497 Y-S 750 Q mutations abolished all CTZ and TCM actions without disrupting CX 614 activity. Notably, the S/Q mutation also restored L/Y deactivation and EC 50 to wild-type levels without restoring desensitization, further demonstrating that desensitization can be modulated independently of deactivation and EC 50 by mutagenesis and possibly by allosteric modulators...|$|E

At the age of 4 mo, he was diagnosed as having CNDI, judging from fever with hypernatremia (serum Na 153 mEq/L), diluted urine (urine osmolarity 193 mOsm/kg), high antidiuretic hormone (plasma antidiuretic hormone 53 pg/mL), and normal renal function (serum creatinine 0. 3 mg/dL). His length and weight were mean + 0. 4 and – 1. 1 SD, respectively, at that time. He was treated with sodium restriction (sodium intake; 0. 53 mEq/kg/day) using low sodium formula in addition to <b>trichlormethiazide,</b> spironolactone, and mefenamic acid.

The whole method involves three analytical steps, including (1) liquid/liquid extraction of the analytes from the matrix, (2) their reaction with methyl iodide at 70 ◦C for 2 h to form methyl derivatives, (3) analysis of the resulting mixture by fast gas chromatography/electron impact mass spectrometry (fast GC/EI-MS). The analytical method was validated by determining selectivity, linearity, accuracy, intra and inter assay precision, extraction efficiencies and {{signal to noise ratio}} (S/N) at the lowest calibration level (LCL) for all candidate analytes. The analytical performances of three extraction procedures and five combination of derivatization parameters were compared in order to probe the conditions for speeding up the sample preparation step. Limits of detection (LOD) were evaluated in both EI-MS and ECNI-MS (electron capture negative ionization mass spectrometry) modes, indicating better sensitivity for most of the analytes using the latter ionization technique. The use of short columns and high carrier gas velocity in fast GC/MS produced efficient separation of the analytes in less than 4 min, resulting in a drastic reduction of the analysis time, while a resolution comparable to that obtained from classic GC conditions is maintained.

In the DCT, 10 (- 4) M furosemide did not change JCl(LB) {{even if it was}} added to the lumen with 10 (- 4) M TCM, whereas 10 (- 5) M amiloride in the lumen decreased the lumen-to-bath 22 Na flux (JNa(LB)) and VT. In the CNT, TCM added to the lumen did not affect the bath-to-lumen 36 Cl flux. Addition of TCM to the bath slightly decreased JCl(LB). Luminal addition of 10 (- 4) M TCM also decreased JNa(LB). Amiloride at 10 (- 5) M in the lumen decreased both JNa(LB) and VT. Addition of TCM with 10 (- 5) M amiloride further decreased JNa(LB) without affecting VT, indicating that TCM affects the electroneutral Na+ transport, which is distinct from the amiloride-sensitive conductive Na+ pathway. When Na+ was removed from the lumen, JCl(LB) was markedly decreased, but addition of TCM did not cause further decrease in JCl(LB). Furosemide did not affect JCl(LB), but addition of both 10 (- 4) M TCM and furosemide decreased JCl(LB), indicating that Na+-K+- 2 Cl- cotransport is not involved in the action of TCM. Removal of HCO 3 - slightly decreased JCl(LB), and TCM caused further decrease in JCl(LB). Amiloride at 10 (- 3) M, a concentration supposed to inhibit the Na+/H+ antiport, slightly decreased JCl(LB), and addition of TCM caused a further marked decrease in JJl(LB). The similar results were also obtained when the combined effects of 10 (- 3) M 4, 4 '-diisothiocyano-stilben- 2, 2 '-disulfonate(DIDS) and 10 (- 4) M TCM were examined. These findings suggest that the parallel antiport of Na+/H+ and Cl-/HCO 3 - is not involved in the action of TCM. By excluding other possible mechanisms involving neutral Na+-dependent Cl- transport, we conclude that TCM inhibits Na+-Cl- cotransport in the luminal membrane of the rabbit CNT...|$|E
40|$|Study I: This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} whether non-invasive assessment of cardiovascular system discriminates white coat hypertension (WCH). The major reason is the high prevalence of WCH in these subjects and it remains uncertain whether WCH is associated with cardiovascular risk. Women were required to be naturally menopausal; at least 1 year, but not greater than 5 years, past their menstrual period. Exclusion criteria were past history of preeclampsia or eclampsia, severe illness such as myocardial infarction and stroke within 6 months, having used estrogens or progestins within 3 months, being treated with antihypertensive agents or with non pharmacological therapy such as reduction of daily salt, and proteinuric nephropathy. In addition, secondary hypertension was excluded as possible. WCH was defined if subjects who had BP more than 150 / 90 mmHg at office had to have both mean systolic and diastolic pressures below 120 / 80 mmHg at home. Forty-four subjects, mean age 52 years, recruited from the outpatients clinic, were examined. BPs at office and home, pulse wave velocity (PWV), and augmentation index (Aix) were recorded. Left ventricular diameter, septal wall thickness, and left posterior wall thickness were assessed by M-mode echocardiography after selecting the measurement section by B-mode echocardiography. Twenty patients were diagnosed as having WCH based on the criteria in the trial. We found that the patterns of pulse wave were different between subjects with WCH and those with hypertension. The most prominent difference was the levels of Aix. In subjects with WCH, Aixs were 25. 6 ± 3. 8 compared to 38. 6 ± 4. 5 mmHg in those with hypertension. Moreover, PWV of subjects with WCH were 6. 05 ± 0. 53 and those of with hypertension were 8. 45 ± 0. 72 m/sec (p＜ 0. 01). In addition to these findings, {{there was a significant}} association between the values of home systolic BP but not those of office systolic BP and PWV, Aix and LV mass index. When we combined the data of LV mass index and Aix, white coat hypertension was easily segregated from hypertension. The combination of self BP monitoring, echocardiographic data and Aix and PWV would be powerful indicators for treatment of hypertension in postmenopausal women. Study II: To assess the efficacy of the various classes of antihypertensive drugs in postmenopausal women with hypertension. Women were required to be naturally menopausal; at least 1 year, but not greater than 5 years, past their menstrual period. Exclusion criteria were past history of preeclampsia or eclampsia, severe illness such as myocardial infarction and stroke within 6 months, having used estrogens or progestins within 3 months, and proteinuric nephropathy as well as surgically menopausal. 114 women who participated in this study after informed consent were obtained. These women were diagnosed as having hypertension based on BP of more than 140 / 90 mmHg at clinic as well as on self-reported BP of more than 130 / 85 mmHg at home. If both levels of BP were not satisfied with the criteria, such patients were also excluded. All antihypertensive medications were withdrawn 6 weeks before the initiation of the study. All patients were randomly assigned in equal numbers to the following therapeutic groups; A) losartan, 50 mg daily and <b>trichlormethiazide</b> 2 mg twice a week and B) cilnidipine, a calcium channel blocker, 5 mg and arotinolol, an αβ blocker, 10 mg daily. Three groups were retrospectively segregated according to pulse pressure (PP) {{at the start of the}} study: Group I (n＝ 24); more than 65 mmHg: Group II (n＝ 58); below 64 to more than 45 mmHg and Group III (n＝ 32); below 44 mmHg. In Group I, combination therapy with B) reduced systolic BP much more compared to that with A) (169 ± 2 / 88 ± 5 to 133 ± 2 / 73 ± 5 vs 169 ± 2 / 88 ± 5 to 149 ± 2 / 66 ± 5 mmHg, p＜ 0. 05). On the other hand, in Group III, A) decreased diastolic BP as well as systolic BP (152 ± 2 / 106 ± 2 to 123 ± 1 / 78 ± 1 vs 149 ± 2 / 107 ± 2 to 129 ± 2 / 84 ± 1 mmHg, p＜ 0. 05). In Group II, there was no significant difference between two antihypertensive regimens. Other three biological markers were not influenced by any type of treatment. PP before starting medication of hypertension may be useful for the choice of antihypertensive drugs. Combining these two studies, it is suggested that evaluation and treatment of hypertensive postmenopausal women would be much more investigated than previously and be needed much work to be carried out...|$|E
