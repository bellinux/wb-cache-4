The ministry of Education in Iran has launched the project of <b>thematic</b> <b>classes</b> to improve learning in 2010 with the hope of copying with some of the educational problems so that students experience deeper learning.   For subjects of the study, 90 7 th grade students of junior high school in Taybad, Khorasan e Razavi were selected. Three groups were used in this study: two experimental groups and one control group. Each group consisted of 30 female students, who settled randomly in the groups, respectively. Their range of age was between 13 and 14. A vocabulary-based test, which was designed by the researcher, was used as the main measurement tool in the study to evaluate the students' achievement in the course. The course lasted 10 weeks, two sessions per week. The results reflected the positive effect of <b>thematic</b> <b>classes</b> on vocabulary learning. Therefore, educational implication of <b>thematic</b> <b>class</b> for junior high school is suggestible...|$|R

40|$|High {{resolution}} {{land cover}} {{and land use}} classifications have applications in many fields of study such as land use and cover change, carbon storage measurements and environmental impact assessments. The wide range of available imagery at different spatial resolutions, potential <b>thematic</b> <b>classes,</b> and classification methods introduces the problem of understanding how each aspect affects accuracy. This study investigates how these three aspects affect the results of land cover classification. Results show that the maximum likelihood classifier was able to produce the most consistent results with the highest average accuracy (82. 9 %). Classifiers {{were able to identify}} a spatial resolution for each thematic resolution that achieved a distinctly higher overall accuracy. In addition, the effects of different land cover classifications as input to an object-based classification of land use at the parcel scale were evaluated. Results showed that land use classification requires higher resolution imagery to obtain satisfactory results than what is required for land cover classification. Also, the highest accuracy land cover classification did not produce the highest accuracy for land use, where a higher number of <b>thematic</b> <b>classes</b> performs better than fewer <b>thematic</b> <b>classes.</b> The highest accuracy LC classification by MLC with 8 classes occurred at 640 cm and achieved an overall accuracy of 83. 3 %. The highest accuracy LU classification was produced by the 80 cm LC with 8 classes and achieved an overall accuracy of 88. 0 %. Aside from the produced land cover and land use classifications, this study produces a lookup table in the form of multiple graphs for future research to reference when selecting imagery and determining <b>thematic</b> <b>classes</b> and classification methods...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Since <b>thematic</b> <b>classes</b> are {{represented}} with high spectral variance, pixel-based classifications generally result with incontinuous and inhomogeneous outputs. Objectbased classifications {{overcome this problem}} by the approach similar to human seeing and interpreting activity. First, image is segmented into smaller objects, and then image objects are assigned to classes according to their spectral reflectance statistics, shape & texture properties, and neighborhood relations. Segmentation and classification can be structured as a multi-level network. The final output is formed by obtaining the classification results from the most suitable level for each <b>thematic</b> <b>class.</b> In this study, in order to investigate an appropriate method for a general landcover mapping, isodata and maximum likelihood methods of pixel-based image classifications were compared with condition based and nearest neighbor methods of object-based classifications.

Figurative speech is secondary to the actual speech. We can distinguish the group of grounds on which it is possible to carry out classification of the figurative language means. This analysis can give a fairly complete linguistic interpretation of figurative expressions. <b>Thematic</b> <b>classes</b> of metaphor correspond to the six semantic fields, covering all the material-subject and object-indeed perfect: 1. the subject; 2. animal; 3. people; 4. physical world; 5. mental world; 6. abstraction (according to the classification of G.

40|$|International audienceIn this study, an {{incremental}} and iterative approach for possibility distributions estimation in pixel-based images classification context is proposed. This approach {{is based on}} the use of possibilistic reasoning in order to enrich a set of samples serving for the initial estimation of possibility distributions. The use of possibilistic concepts enables an important flexibility for the integration of a context-based additional semantic knowledge source formed by pixels belonging with high certainty to different semantic classes (called possibilistic seeds), into the available knowledge encoded by possibility distributions. Once possibilistic seeds are extracted, possibility distributions are incrementally updated and refined. Synthetic images composed of two <b>thematic</b> <b>classes</b> are generated in order to evaluate the performances of the proposed approach. Initial possibility distributions are, first, obtained using a priori knowledge given in the form of learning areas delimitated by an expert.
