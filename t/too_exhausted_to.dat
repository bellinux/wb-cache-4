5|$|On {{arrival at}} the Anhalter Station at Berlin, List felt <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} the journey. After a doctor had diagnosed a lung inflammation his health deteriorated quickly, and he died in a Berlin guesthouse {{on the morning of}} 17 May 1919. He was cremated in Leipzig and his ashes laid in an urn and then buried at the Vienna Central Cemetery, Zentralfriedhof. An obituary of List authored by Berlin journalist Philipp Stauff then appeared in the Münchener Beobachter.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} Rupert's actions, {{even after his}} forces disengaged, was to force another delay in the Parliamentarian retreat; Essex spent much of 19 September looking after wounded {{soldiers}} and, when he finally managed to begin moving again, he was confronted with swampland and bog which further delayed him while the Royalists marched across the relatively open chalk downs above the Kennet. These hardships meant that the Royalists arrived at Newbury before Essex, with both armies settling down for the night outside the town, <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> immediately fight.|$|E
5|$|While {{she tried}} to involve herself {{in the arts and}} {{sciences}} and distance herself from society protocols, she continued to feel the burden of her duties. Christmas 1877 provided respite for Alice, as all the family gathered together again, and she doted on her youngest daughters Alix and Marie. She was <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> attend the wedding of her niece, Princess Charlotte of Prussia, in Berlin, in January 1878. In the Autumn of 1878, Queen Victoria paid for the Grand Ducal family to holiday in Eastbourne, where they stayed in a house on the Grand Parade. Alice performed various royal duties on this trip and visited her mother at Osborne before returning to the New Palace at Darmstadt in late 1878.|$|E
50|$|Jeff Chandler played Boynton {{and stayed}} with the role for five years, even after {{becoming}} a movie star. He ultimately resigned because it was <b>too</b> <b>exhausting</b> <b>to</b> juggle a regular radio role with his film commitments.|$|R
50|$|The same year, Bassie & Adriaan {{converted}} another radio-play into a TV-series; it {{was their}} first since The Poltergeist not to be filmed abroad. Adriaan found it <b>too</b> <b>exhausting</b> <b>to</b> play two roles as well as directing the series; Paul van Gorcum (Archibald Chagrijn during The Crying Professor and the museums warden from The Diamond) took {{over the role of}} the Baron.|$|R
60|$|WE had now {{reached the}} summit of the loftiest crag. For some minutes the old man seemed <b>too</b> much <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> speak.|$|R
25|$|Qin was <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> {{follow up}} its victory. Some time later it sent an army to besiege the Zhao capital but {{the army was}} {{destroyed}} when it was attacked from the rear. Zhao survived, {{but there was no}} longer a state that could resist Qin on its own. The other states could have survived if they remained united against Qin, but they did not.|$|E
25|$|As soon as Bakari was sighted, {{a member}} of the rescue team threw her a life preserver, but the waters were too rough, and she was <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> grab it. One of the sailors, Maturaffi Sélémane Libounah, jumped into the water and handed her a {{flotation}} device, after which they were both pulled safely aboard the Sima Com 2, where she was given dry blankets and a hot drink.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 26 December, {{elements}} of Golitsyn's 4th Division reached Golymin. They were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> continue to Makow and Golitsyn also needed to wait for units of Sacken's 3rd Division. In the village he found Dokhturov, who had sent most of his 5th Division towards Makow, but remained at Golymin with a dragoon and an infantry regiment. Golitsyn hoped to rest his men before continuing their retreat.|$|E
60|$|Ruth {{was soon}} conscious, but <b>too</b> much <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> {{do or say}} anything, and lay quietly {{suffering}} the discomforts of resuscitation till she fell asleep.|$|R
60|$|Moses Pyne being, {{like his}} great namesake, a meek man, sympathised with the others, {{but said nothing}} about himself, though his looks betrayed him. Armstrong and Stevenson were silent. They seemed <b>too</b> much <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> indulge in speech.|$|R
60|$|The poor {{child was}} far <b>too</b> much <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> undergo the pumping process {{referred}} to. He could merely answer that Njamie and Okandaga and Mbango were prisoners in the camp, {{and then turned}} languidly away, as if he desired rest.|$|R
25|$|The battle {{wound down}} and was broken off {{due to the}} cold, rainy weather and the {{exhaustion}} of the men but the two armies stayed in position on the battlefield. Bragg finally decided {{to withdraw from the}} field on January 3, 1863 because he feared Rosecrans was being reinforced. Rosecrans's force, including the regulars, were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> pursue the retreating Confederates, and also were hindered because the Confederates captured or destroyed much of the Union Army's food.|$|E
25|$|When McGowan's men {{finally gave}} way, Cooke's brigades {{collapsed}} {{from east to}} west although Cooke's own brigade was farthest {{from the end of the}} line and withdrew in better order than the other survivors who managed to escape. The Confederates who did not become casualties or prisoners retreated toward the Appomattox River, moving mostly in disorder toward Amelia Court House. The South Side Railroad, the final Confederate supply line to Petersburg, had been permanently severed by the Union Army. Most of Miles's men were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> pursue the Confederate fugitives. Besides, Miles understood that Sheridan had ordered his men to drive the enemy toward Petersburg, so he turned his division in that direction and allowed them to rest.|$|E
25|$|Murat's Reserve Cavalry Corps and Augereau's 7th Corps set out {{towards the}} town {{at first light}} (around 7 am). Lasalle's Cavalry Division {{were the first to}} arrive from the {{south-west}} at about 10am. Golitsyn reinforced his rearguard of two squadrons of cavalry with three squadrons of cuirassiers, and Lasalle's men were driven back to the woods. But at around 2 p.m. Augereau's Corps appeared from the east. Golitsyn gave up his attempt to retreat, as his men were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> retire without fighting. He sent one regiment of infantry under the command of Prince Shcherbatov into the woods around Kaleczin and posted the rest of his troops in front of Golymin. He put his cavalry and Dokhturov's troops as his reserves, and positioned the rest of his division in front of Golymin.|$|E
6000|$|Phyllis finding herself {{ready to}} roar, left off speaking, and laying {{her head on}} the table, burst into an agony of crying, while Mr. Devereux was <b>too</b> much <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> address her; at last she exclaimed: 'I hear the nursery door; he is going!' ...|$|R
60|$|That will exhaust the Reader check--if it isn't <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> itself <b>to</b> come. You, of course, {{will keep}} the check when it arrives--I don't think they will fall down on it surely. I wrote Howland a pretty sharp letter and ordered him to send it at once care of Everybody's.|$|R
60|$|Poor Louise {{would have}} objected, but her breath was <b>too</b> much <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> express herself; and she {{permitted}} her good natured guardian {{to take her}} little basket, which, when the dog beheld, he came straight before Henry, stood up, and shook his fore paws, whining gently, as if he too wanted to be carried.|$|R
25|$|On January 18, Russian forces {{launched}} a massive air and artillery attack; by Chechen estimation, rockets were hitting the palace {{at a rate}} of one per second. Sukhoi Su-25 fighter aircraft dropped two bunker busters into the Palace. The bombs fell through all 11 floors and fell into the reinforced bunker below the building; one landed 20 meters from the HQ of General Maskhadov, miraculously not exploding. Before midnight, the Chechen command left the Palace in three groups, Maskhadov being among the last to leave. These groups retreated to a hospital {{on the south side of}} the Sunzha River, while Russian helicopters flew over the city calling on Chechens to surrender with no effect. According to elements of the Chechen command, Russian snipers had Chechens in full sight but were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> continue fighting.|$|E
25|$|Advanced Union skirmishers {{continued}} to {{fire at the}} Confederate positions from {{the house on the}} field and other outbuildings {{on the south side of}} the creek. Colonel Hill asked four volunteers to go forward and burn the house. Fire from across the main road stopped them and they dove to the ground. One of them, Private Henry L. Wyatt, had been killed. The others were called back and soon Major Randolph was able to destroy the house with artillery fire. Lieutenant Greble, whose guns had been hidden by the house, {{continued to}} fire and exposed his position. By this time the battle was ending and Peirce ordered all of his force to retire. It was clear that the Confederate position was too strong and his troops were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> continue a costly and increasingly futile attack.|$|E
25|$|When Stevenson {{heard the}} {{fighting}} between Walthall and Geary, he ordered Pettus to take three regiments {{from the summit}} to assist Jackson. By this time, Moore's Alabamians were moving up amidst Walthall's retreating men, and they fired on Ireland's New Yorkers from 100 yards. Unable to see {{the size of the}} force resisting it through the fog, the Union men retreated beyond a stone wall. Moore's 1,000 men took positions in the rifle pits facing the wall and waited for the inevitable counterattack. Ireland's men were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> make an immediate move. As Whitaker's brigade arrived after 1 p.m., they stepped over Ireland's men and rushed into the attack. Candy's brigade was moving up the mountain side on Whitaker's left, followed by the brigades of Woods and Grose. Moore {{could see that he was}} being significantly outflanked on the right and chose to fall back rather than be surrounded.|$|E
60|$|I entreated to {{know what}} it was {{designed}} to do with me; but my conductor, in a voice of menacing authority, desired me to be silent on my peril; and my strength and spirits were <b>too</b> much <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> permit my continuing a dialogue so singular, even if I could have promised myself any good result by doing so.|$|R
60|$|During {{all this}} {{exciting}} chase Waboose's mother had {{clung to her}} stalwart support with the uncomplaining patience of Indian women; but we were deeply concerned to find on halting that she was <b>too</b> much <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> dismount and that blood was trickling from her lips. Indeed, she would have fallen to the ground if Big Otter had not caught her in his arms.|$|R
25|$|After the Australians {{touched down}} in Horn Island, {{one of the}} five has gone back to work, another is {{restoring}} his home — a boat on which he lives — to full order, and another is taking a break, <b>too</b> emotionally <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> think about working. William Scott-Bloxam, the main player in the five's detention, and wife Vera have set about resurrecting their aviation business.|$|R
25|$|The {{big guns}} {{opened fire on}} the New Madrid {{defensive}} positions on March 13, and continued throughout the day. McCown realized that Pope would try to attack his forts by regular approaches. He felt that his reduced artillery companies would be <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> resist, so {{he decided not to}} wait for the inevitable. On the night of March 13–14, orders were given to abandon the town and its two forts. A heavy rainstorm hid the troop movements from the enemy, so the evacuation was accomplished without incident. There was some confusion (which seems to have been exaggerated in Pope's reports), and the departure was so sudden that the guns in the forts had to be spiked and left behind, but most of the troops were successfully removed and redistributed. On the morning of March 14, two deserters appeared bearing a white flag, and informed Pope that the town was deserted.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners {{directed}} from Bleiburg to {{the town}} of Slovenj Gradec were joined by a large number of refugees that were stuck on the Dravograd-Slovenj Gradec road. Several transit camps were set in the town where prisoners were placed and sorted. Around 1,500 were killed in the nearby village of Žančani. The prisoners were only briefly held in Slovenj Gradec, mostly a day, before they continued their way to Celje. Anyone who stepped out of the column to take a rest or drink water was shot. Those that were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> continue the march were also shot. In Celje, most of the prisoners were placed in a football yard {{on the outskirts of the}} city. The command of the 11th Krajina Division of the 1st Army reported on 17 May that they received 30,000 prisoners. Anti-tank trenches near the Sava River and in the area of Bukovžlak were used for executions. Prisoners were killed in various ways; on one occasion around 100-200 were locked in an enclosed water reservoir. Water was then slowly released until all of them drowned.|$|E
500|$|LeMond did {{extensive}} endurance {{training on}} the road the following winter, but his performances the following spring failed to improve. LeMond had to abandon the 1993 Giro d'Italia {{two days before the}} final stage after difficult racing left him third-from-last on GC. He was <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> enter the 1993 Tour de France. Following the 1993 season LeMond hired renowned Dutch physiologist Adrie van Diemen to advise him on a new technique to monitor training and measure performance. The (SRM) power-based training would make use of the watt as a guide to power output. In November 1993 LeMond confided to Samuel Abt that power output in watts would become the key metric. [...] The watt has gained wide acceptance as the best measure of a cyclist's training performance.|$|E
2500|$|Graphic novel writer Riad Sattouf {{had studied}} {{animation}} and had dreams of filmmaking, {{but he thought}} that it would be <b>too</b> <b>exhausting</b> <b>to</b> write and re-write a script, find producers, find funding and censor his ideas to please others. Sattouf had rejected several film offers before because they lacked creative freedom, but he agreed when he was contacted by Anne-Dominique Toussaint, a film producer and a fan of Sattouf's graphic novels who wanted to make a teen film. Sattouf wrote the first draft of the script and then asked screenwriter Marc Syrigas to help him to re-write it. Rather than make a film about [...] "the codes of today's teens, the way they talk, [...] their arsenal of electronic devices", Sattouf wanted to focus on [...] "the intensity of their emotions". He wanted to depict [...] "the things that happen during teenage-hood that we don't show so often".|$|R
60|$|If I could {{possibly}} have attended the meeting yesterday I would most gladly have done so. But I have been up the whole night, and was <b>too</b> much <b>exhausted</b> even <b>to</b> write and say so before the proceedings came on.|$|R
60|$|Gaff {{wrapped his}} jacket round the child, and hurried away {{in search of}} the highroad. He knew the place well. He had been wrecked on a reef within two miles of his native hamlet, and within three of the town of Wreckumoft. He soon found the road, and broke from a fast walk into a run. The child lay quietly in his arms, either being <b>too</b> much <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> speak, or having fallen asleep.|$|R
500|$|After Doolittle, {{tensions}} between Deal and Francis {{came to a}} head (for example, Francis threw a guitar at Deal during a concert in Stuttgart), and Deal was almost fired from the band when she refused to play at a concert in Frankfurt. Santiago, in an interview with Mojo, described Deal as being [...] "headstrong and want to include her own songs, to explore her own world" [...] on the band's albums; eventually she accepted that Francis was the singer and had musical control of the band, but after the Frankfurt incident, [...] "they kinda stopped talking". The band became increasingly tired during the post-Doolittle [...] "Fuck or Fight" [...] tour of the United States and fighting among members continued. After the tour's final date in New York City, the band was <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> attend the end-of-tour party the following night and soon announced a hiatus.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of Doolittle, the {{relationship}} between the band members became strained because of constant touring and the pressure of releasing three albums in two years. After the final date of the Doolittle [...] "Fuck or Fight" [...] tour in November 1989, the band was <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> attend their end-of-tour party the following night and shortly afterwards announced a hiatus. After the band reconvened in mid-1990, Lovering moved to Los Angeles {{along with the rest of}} the band. The Pixies released two more albums, Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991). Lovering sang lead vocals on the [...] "Velouria" [...] B-side [...] "Make Believe"; a song about his admitted [...] "obsession" [...] with US singer-songwriter Debbie Gibson. The Pixies toured sporadically throughout 1991 and 1992. They eventually broke up in 1992, mostly due to tensions between Thompson and Deal, although it was not publicly announced until 1993.|$|E
500|$|After the setback at Aspern-Essling, Napoleon {{took more}} than six weeks in {{planning}} and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt at crossing the Danube. From 30 June to {{the early days of}} July, the French recrossed the Danube in strength, with more than [...] troops marching across the Marchfeld towards the Austrians. Charles received the French with [...] of his own men. In the ensuing Battle of Wagram, which also lasted two days, Napoleon commanded his forces in what was the largest battle of his career up until then. Napoleon finished off the battle with a concentrated central thrust that punctured a hole in the Austrian army and forced Charles to retreat. Austrian losses were very heavy, reaching well over [...] casualties. The French were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> pursue the Austrians immediately, but Napoleon eventually caught up with Charles at Znaim and the latter signed an armistice on 12 July.|$|E
60|$|The {{battle was}} known as Cedar Run, and it {{completely}} checked Pope's advance upon Richmond. The troops were <b>too</b> much <b>exhausted</b> <b>to</b> follow up their victory, but Jackson urged them to press forward. They moved {{a mile and a}} half in advance, and then found themselves so strongly opposed that Jackson, believing that the enemy must have received re-enforcements, halted his men. Colonel Jones was sent forward to reconnoiter, and discovered that a large force had joined the enemy.|$|R
50|$|Christenson also {{fought in}} Bastogne in the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944. Like {{many of the}} men there, Christenson was sleep-deprived and exhausted. Once, he heard {{shrapnel}} coming in during an artillery attack, but was <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> even <b>to</b> move his arm, and his arm was hit. He did not want a Purple Heart for the wound because he thought that compared to the death of his friends, the wound was nothing. Later, he was evacuated to a hospital due to a frozen foot.|$|R
40|$|The least weasel (Mustela nivalis) is {{a remarkably}} well adapted {{predator}} of mice {{and other small}} animals. Each kill is rather stereotyped, in that the weasel grabs the prey by the {{nape of the neck}} and bites through the base of the skull and/or throat, using its lithe body to 2 ̆ 2 wrap up 2 ̆ 2 and hold the prey. The least weasel will kill mice successively until it is <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> physically <b>to</b> kill more. Mice are always eaten from the head posteriorly until completely consumed...|$|R
