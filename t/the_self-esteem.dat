5|$|Another {{group of}} {{researchers}} has framed the cause {{in terms of}} social psychology, specifically <b>the</b> <b>self-esteem</b> theory. Beginning with Greenwald and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from implicit self-esteem, a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people like themselves. The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters. As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.|$|E

In their first brainstorming sessions in 1994, Santomero, Kessler, and Johnson decided to promote mastery rather than rote learning or memorizing, make sure that their viewers knew the answers to the puzzles with which they were presented, and include elements of surprise and play.

2500|$|Many early {{theories}} {{suggested that}} self-esteem {{is a basic}} human need or motivation. American psychologist Abraham Maslow included self-esteem in his hierarchy of human needs.

Respect from others was believed to be more fragile and easily lost than inner self-esteem. According to Maslow, without the fulfillment of <b>the</b> <b>self-esteem</b> need, individuals will be driven to seek it and unable to grow and obtain self-actualization. Maslow also states that the healthiest expression of self-esteem [...] "is the one which manifests in respect we deserve for others, more than renown, fame and flattery". [...] Modern theories of self-esteem explore the reasons humans are motivated to maintain a high regard for themselves. Sociometer theory maintains that self-esteem evolved to check one's level of status and acceptance in ones' social group. According to Terror Management Theory, self-esteem serves a protective function and reduces anxiety about life and death.|$|E
