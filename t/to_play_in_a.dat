5|$|In {{contrast}} to these materialistic views, Aristotelianism considered all natural things as actualisations of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms. This {{was part of}} a medieval teleological understanding of nature in which all things have an intended role <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> divine cosmic order. Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and were integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond one-for-one with exact metaphysical forms and specifically gave examples of how new types of living things could come to be.|$|E

While Greg Kurstin, who used <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> jazz band, took influences from A Charlie Brown Christmas by the Vince Guaraldi Trio and A Christmas Gift for You by Phil Spector as his inspirations, which resulted to the album's Wall of Sound resonance. Clarkson also cited that {{her relationship with her}} then-fiancé Brandon Blackstock had inspired some of the album's lyrical content.|$|E

5|$|Müller's role can be {{described}} as an attacking all-rounder, a player able <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of forward positions.

He can play in any of the attacking midfield roles but usually plays in the centre for Bayern, and on the right for Germany. He has been used as an out-and-out striker on occasion.|$|E
