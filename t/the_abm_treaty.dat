25|$|The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty {{began in}} November 1969 in Helsinki. The interim {{agreement}} signed in Moscow in May 1972 froze existing levels of deployment of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and regulated {{the growth of}} submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). As part of the SALT process, <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty</b> was also signed.|$|E
25|$|The Army {{picked up}} these options, {{developing}} two concepts. The first, Project Quick-Shot, was basically {{identical to the}} Feld and Tsipis version, although they did consider some sort of low-cost guidance system as well. A second concept launched optical trackers into space {{in the path of}} the incoming missiles, and used their data to fine-tune the launch of unguided rockets that would work at longer ranges. As this had no radar component, it would bypass provisions in <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty</b> over the number and placement of radar sites.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, Reagan went on {{to state}} that [...] "we {{do not wish to}} embark on any course of action that could endanger <b>the</b> current <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty</b> so long as it is {{observed}} by the Soviet Union... we do not wish to build even <b>the</b> minimal <b>ABM</b> system allowed us by the treaty." [...] In February 1983, Sentry was officially cancelled.|$|R

Sentry was cancelled in February 1983.|$|R
50|$|The Western {{view of the}} {{deployment}} of these systems was governed by the strategic theory of Mutual Assured Destruction. In the 1950s and 1960s, development began on Anti-Ballistic Missile systems by both the U.S. and USSR; these systems were restricted by <b>the</b> 1972 <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty.</b> <b>The</b> first successful <b>ABM</b> test were conducted by the USSR in 1961, that later deployed a fully operating system defending Moscow in the 1970s (see Moscow ABM system).|$|R
25|$|Gromyko {{played a}} direct {{role in the}} Cuban Missile Crisis {{in his role as}} the Soviet Foreign Minister. Gromyko helped {{negotiate}} arms limitations treaties, such as <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty,</b> the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, SALT I and SALT II, among others. Under Leonid Brezhnev's leadership Gromyko helped build the policy of détente between the US and the USSR. He supported Mikhail Gorbachev's candidacy for General Secretary in 1985. Gromyko lost his office as foreign minister when Gorbachev became General Secretary, and was instead appointed to the largely ceremonial office of head of state. Gromyko retired from political life in 1988, and died the following year in Moscow.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 serious {{efforts to}} explore the ABM problem started. By this point the US and USSR had agreed in <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty</b> to deploy up to 100 ABMs at only two sites. MIRVs had so seriously upset the balance between ABM and ICBM that both parties agreed to limit ABM {{deployment}} largely {{as a way of}} avoiding a massive buildup of new ICBMs. The only good news for the UK in this development was that it clearly defined the problem they were facing; their attacks {{had to be able to}} credibly defeat a 100-interceptor ABM defense around Moscow. Thus started project KH.793, a one-year project to identify potential solutions.|$|E
25|$|With President Jimmy Carter's {{decision}} to base the MX {{in a series}} of less-hardened horizontal silos in 1977, LoADS development was accelerated. The system as a whole was renamed Sentry, with the missile becoming the Baseline Terminal Defense System, or BTDS. Work on MX and Sentry was further accelerated by incoming President Ronald Reagan in 1981. However, after another review of the MX program, Reagan chose a different MX deployment concept and cancelled Sentry, stating that it would violate <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty.</b> As the questionable security of the MX once again became an issue, Reagan briefly entertained an even shorter-range system known as Swarmjet, before the entire MX program was severely curtailed with the ending of the Cold War.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the Nixon {{administration}} Smith was appointed director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA). He led the U.S. negotiating team during the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) with the Soviet Union which resulted in <b>the</b> Antiballistic Missile (<b>ABM)</b> <b>Treaty</b> of 1972.|$|R
50|$|START II did {{not enter}} into force. On 14 April 2000 the Duma did finally ratify the treaty, in a largely {{symbolic}} move since the ratification was made contingent on preserving <b>the</b> Anti-Ballistic Missile <b>Treaty</b> (<b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty)</b> and thereby preserving the long-standing principle of mutually assured destruction (MAD). To be specific, Russian ratification was made contingent on the U.S. Senate ratifying a September 1997 addendum to START II which included agreed statements on demarcation of strategic versus tactical missile defences. Neither of these occurred because of U.S. Senate opposition, where a faction objected to any action supportive of <b>the</b> existing <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s, Chayes argued {{on behalf}} of the Government of Nicaragua against the United States in the seminal International Court of Justice (ICJ) case Nicaragua v. United States. The ICJ ruled that the U.S. was guilty of [...] "unlawful use of force" [...] when it mined Nicaragua's harbors. Chayes also wrote {{articles}} arguing that the Reagan Administration was barred from testing and deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), or [...] "Star Wars" [...] under <b>the</b> 1972 <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty.</b>|$|R
25|$|LoADS {{proposed}} placing one interceptor {{in one of}} the decoy shelters, thus every set of 23 shelters {{would have}} one MX, one LoADS and 21 decoys. At first glance it might appear that only one additional enemy warhead would be needed, using up the LoADS interceptor. However, only the defender knew where the MX was, and LoADS would only fire at the single warhead seen approaching that shelter. That meant that the MX would almost definitely survive a single warhead attack. In order to be sure the MX was hit, the Soviets would have to attack every shelter with two warheads, assuming one would be lost to the LoADS. For a typical 23-site MPS, 46 warheads would be needed, so if LoADS remained within the 100-interceptor limit of <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty,</b> 4,600 warheads would be needed to attack just one-half of the 200-strong MX fleet, leaving 100 missiles and 1,000 warheads in the US counterattack. An attack against the entire fleet would require them to break the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks limits on the number of offensive warheads.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there was}} a concern in regards to <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty,</b> {{involving}} its use of radars. In order to ensure ABM systems would be suitable for point defense only, <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty</b> limited the number and placement of radar systems. LoADS had a radar with each missile, but these were very short-range {{and could not be}} considered part of a wide-area system, although observers suggested the Soviets would claim otherwise. More importantly, the 1974 amendment to the treaty required those radars to be in the vicinity of Grand Forks, which would not help MPS, which was located well over [...] to the southwest. The Army thus developed LoADS strictly as a technology demonstration program, with the option of rapid construction in case <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty</b> ended. Costs of a deployed system was estimated to be $8.63 billion in 1980 ( [...] billion in [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Unilateral {{elements}} were {{evident in the}} first months of Bush's presidency. Conservative Charles Krauthammer, coiner of the term [...] "Bush Doctrine," [...] deployed [...] "unilateralism," [...] in February 2001 to refer to the president's increased unilateralism in foreign policy, specifically regarding the president's decision to withdraw from <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty.</b>|$|E
50|$|Work still {{continued}} {{on the radar}} even though the Pershing missiles had been removed. The radar was not compliant with <b>the</b> 1972 <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty</b> as this forbade multifunction radars. The Volga was in breach of this as {{it was designed to}} guide anti-ballistic missiles (an 'ABM radar') as well as acting as an early warning radar. As the United States had managed to get the Daryal radar at Yeniseysk demolished for being in breach of the treaty the Soviet Union removed ABM radar abilities from the Volga as it was being built.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the case}} of an attack on the USSR, even a single Resolution could have ensured the {{destruction}} of {{a significant portion of the}} Soviet command and control structure. Given all sixteen missiles launching successfully, an ABM system would be presented with 551 credible-looking targets to deal with. Given that <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty</b> limited the USSR to 100 ABM interceptors, a [...] "hit" [...] was virtually guaranteed.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Krauthammer {{first used}} the phrase in June 2001 to {{describe}} the Bush Administration's [...] "...unilaterally withdrawing from <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty</b> and rejecting the Kyoto protocol." [...] After the 9/11 attack, the phrase described the policy that the United States {{had the right to}} secure itself against countries that harbor or give aid to terrorist groups, which was used to justify the 2001 war in Afghanistan. The Bush Doctrine became strongly associated with the Bush administration's decision to invade Iraq in 2003.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 May 1972, President Nixon and Soviet general {{secretary}} Leonid Brezhnev signed <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty,</b> which limited each nation to one site to protect strategic forces and one site {{to protect the}} [...] "National Command Authority." [...] With work about 85 percent complete at Grand Forks, the United States chose to finish construction at the North Dakota site. On 21 August 1972, the Army Corps of Engineers turned over the PAR to the Safeguard Systems Command (SAFSCOM) Site Activation Team. The transfer of the MSR occurred on 3 January 1973. Work on the four remote launch sites fell behind schedule, with the last completed on 5 November 1972. Testing of the PAR commenced {{during the summer of}} 1973.|$|E
5000|$|Smith {{resigned}} from {{the government for the}} last time in 1980. He organized a private consulting firm, the Consultants International Group, which specialized in advising companies on international investments. He also retained an interest in disarmament and was active in educational and lobbying organizations such as the Arms Control Association and the Washington Council on Non-Proliferation. He strongly opposed President Ronald Reagan’s proposed Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI; popularly known as“Star Wars”) which he felt violated <b>the</b> 1972 <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty,</b> and together with George Kennan, McGeorge Bundy and Robert McNamara co-authored an article in Foreign Affairs calling upon the US to declare a policy of [...] "no first use" [...] of nuclear weapons.|$|R
50|$|The Moscow Summit of 1972 was {{a summit}} meeting between President Richard M. Nixon of the United States and General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. It was held May 22 - 30, 1972. It {{featured}} {{the signing of}} <b>the</b> Anti-Ballistic Missile (<b>ABM)</b> <b>Treaty,</b> <b>the</b> first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT I), and the U.S.-Soviet Incidents at Sea agreement.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} heated debates taking place on Capitol Hill {{surround}} a proposed American national missile defense system. The debate is not new. For twenty years, <b>the</b> Anti-Ballistic Missile (<b>ABM)</b> <b>Treaty</b> and its underlying acceptance of mutual assured destruction (MAD) enjoyed widespread support among U. S. leaders. Events of the early 1990 s shook support for America's "no missile defense" posture to its very core. The fall of the Soviet Union, the {{proliferation of weapons of}} mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile technology, and the Gulf War presented new challenges to existing strategic doctrine. As a result, a renewed push for a U. S. National Missile Defense (NMD) system began in earnest, and a new round of debates began over the utility of <b>the</b> bilateral <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty</b> in a multilateral post-Cold War international environment This thesis identifies four distinct paths which the United States could follow in addressing the NMD-ABM Treaty debate. Each path is characterized by distinct factors which historically have influenced past <b>ABM</b> system debates. <b>The</b> most likely path to NMD that the United States is following, based on these driving factors, is identified. The potential implications which this prevalent NMD path may have on U. S. Navy force structure and planning is also addressed. Understanding how the current NMD debate is structured and driven enables one to discern which path to NMD deployment the United States is on. This realization can help shape future force planning considerations. NAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R
2500|$|As a {{hedge against}} the {{possibility}} of the Soviets [...] "breaking out" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty,</b> the Army was given the go-ahead to continue development of ABM technologies, focusing on the Safeguard-like concept of defending the missile fields. The Army responded with two concepts, updates to the original Safeguard using a new radar and upgraded Sprint II missile, and a new concept for a high-altitude interceptor that would use hit-to-kill instead of a nuclear warhead. Work on the former, known as Site Defence of Minuteman, went as far as building a radar at the Army's testing site on Meck Island in the Kwajalein Atoll, but work on this program ended in 1974 when it was clear the treaty was going to be followed by both countries.|$|E
2500|$|As the UK {{had decided}} to produce its own warheads and bus, this option would require {{considerable}} development effort {{in order to produce}} a new MIRV bus of their own. Although in theory the UK might {{be able to use the}} US-designed bus, these options were being explored in the midst of <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty,</b> and it was not clear whether the treaty might forbid this technology being transferred. Some related options were explored, including [...] "Option M" [...] which used a simple [...] "de-MIRVed" [...] bus, [...] "Hybrid" [...] (or [...] "Stag") which put the newer Poseidon warheads on the existing Polaris A3T missiles, and [...] "Mini Poseidon", a similar adaptation with a smaller six-Poseidon-warhead payload on the A3T.|$|E
2500|$|Through the 1970s {{a number}} of {{alternative}} concepts to defend the silos had been proposed. Richard Garwin outlined a series of alternatives to large-scale ABM systems like Safeguard. Among these ideas were a [...] "bed of nails" [...] consisting of vertical steel spikes surrounding the silo that would destroy the warhead before it hit the ground and triggered, jamming systems to interrupt radar fuses, the dust defense where small nuclear warheads would be set off while the warheads approached and throw huge amounts of dust into the air that would abrade the warheads, and a non-nuclear {{version of the same}} concept, the [...] "curtain of steel pellets". The last of these was picked up by Bernard Feld and Kosta Tsipis in a major article in Scientific American in 1979. They proposed replacing the shotgun-like projectiles with swarms of small unguided rockets that would fire at a range of about [...] As they were unguided, they suggested {{that they would not be}} considered interceptor missiles under <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty,</b> but also suggested that a renegotiation might be required.|$|E
2500|$|One way {{to improve}} the {{survival}} of the ICBM force would be to actively defend it with an <b>ABM</b> system. However, <b>the</b> 1972 <b>ABM</b> <b>treaty</b> greatly limited <b>the</b> number and geographical deployment of any <b>ABM,</b> with <b>the</b> aim of preventing whole-country protection and thus ensuring MAD. LoADS addressed these limitations by being deployed along with the radars and engagement computers needed to make a successful attack at only very short ranges, [...] or less. The entire system was packed into a cylinder that looked like an MX and would be shuffled between the silos. As the LoADS could be in any of the silos at a particular missile site, the enemy would have to expend two warheads on every silo to ensure a hit, as one would be assumed lost to LoADS. This would not stop a successful counterforce attack, but it would make it significantly more expensive {{in terms of the number}} of warheads used, potentially requiring more warheads than the Soviets had.|$|R
5000|$|Dense Pack is a {{strategy}} for basing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) {{for the purpose of}} maximizing their survivability in case of a surprise nuclear first strike on their silos conducted by a hostile foreign power. The strategy was developed under the Reagan administration as a means of safeguarding America's inventory of MX missiles during the final decade of the Cold War. The U.S. commitments under <b>the</b> Anti-Ballistic Missile (<b>ABM)</b> <b>Treaty</b> prevented <b>the</b> development and staging of adequate ABM installations around its nuclear missile silos. Therefore, it was decided that new and unconventional strategies for protecting these military assets from a sneak-attack had to be developed: [...] "Dense Pack" [...] was one strategy. Other ICBM basing strategies considered during this time were scatterpack, deep basing, rail-mobile, alert ground dispersal, and reverse-inclination basing.|$|R

2500|$|One {{accomplishment}} Gromyko took particular {{pride in}} was {{the signing of}} the Partial Test Ban Treaty on 5 August 1963. The negotiations regarding the treaty had dragged on since 1958.

Other achievements he considered his greatest were {{the signing of the}} Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on 1 July 1968, <b>the</b> <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty</b> and SALT I, followed by the Agreement on the Prevention of Nuclear War in 1973. In retrospect Gromyko said, [...] "If we collect the deliberative nature of the documents, including hundreds of Coded Telegrams, information from the embassies, the analysis of the situation around these problems, there are perhaps as high as the mountain of Mont Blanc. Those papers show the difficulties in overcoming congestions to the path to an agreement, requires the present art of diplomacy." [...] Gromyko always believed in the superpower status of the Soviet Union and always promoted an idea that no important international agreement could be reached without its involvement. In 1972 he said [...] "no international problem of significance anywhere can be resolved without Soviet participation".|$|E

40|$|The Purpose of {{this thesis}} is to {{evaluate}} the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization's proposals for a National Missile Defense (NMD). This thesis compares the costs of missile systems that will provide a NMD, such as Patriot Advanced Capability - 3 (PAC- 3), Navy Area (SM- 2 Block WA), Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Navy Theater-Wide (SM- 3), and the Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI). The data gathered for this thesis included unclassified performance data and the gross cost data relevant to the above systems. Interviews were conducted with personnel that are expert in US Navy SPY radar and Aegis combat systems, and have knowledge of SM- 2 Block WA and SM- 3 missile systems. This thesis concludes that there is redundancy in the development paths to creating a single, centrally located Ground-Based Interceptor and radar (GBI/ GBR) site. By eliminating or amending <b>the</b> 1972 <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty</b> to allow a multi-site NMD, a Coastal NMD could be constructed in the near future, using technology that is available today and missiles that will be placed on ships starting in 2002.

50|$|By {{his third}} term, in the 100th Congress, McCloskey {{had risen to}} chair of the Postal Personnel and Modernization subcommittee. From this position, he held {{hearings}} to determine if toxic biological agents, such as anthrax, should be banned from the U.S. Mail. After investigating the issue, and discovering such a ban could be damaging to medical research, McCloskey adopted a position of strict enforcement of the existing regulations. McCloskey, from {{his position on the}} Armed Services Committee, played a high-profile role in the battle over President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, and argued SDI was a violation of <b>the</b> 1972 U.S./Soviet <b>ABM</b> <b>Treaty.</b> Following a night-time collision of two military helicopters in neighboring Fort Campbell, Kentucky, McCloskey also launched a probe into military flight accidents linked to the use of night vision goggles.
