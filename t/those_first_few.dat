500|$|Though Macfadyen enjoyed {{working in}} the series, {{he began to feel}} [...] "very {{sluggish}} and fed up" [...] with playing the same character for two years. When the producers knew Macfadyen planned to leave, they did not know whether or not he would appear {{in the beginning of the}} third series. Howard Brenton, who wrote the series two finale, originally killed Tom off by drowning him while trying to escape onto the North Sea, while labouring under the impression that he was not to return. The producers would have continued the third series without Tom, however when they heard the actor would be prepared to return for the first two episodes of the third series, they were rewritten to include his character Tom. Brenton had to [...] "unkill him." [...] After a seven-year absence, in October 2011, it was announced that Macfadyen was to make a [...] "fleeting" [...] cameo appearance in the final episode of the series. A Spooks insider stated that his scene [...] "will bring back all the memories of Tom and what the character endured in <b>those</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> series." ...|$|E

500|$|Chuck Taylor also {{reviewed}} [...] "I Want You to Need Me" [...] {{and wrote}} that linking Dion and Diane Warren {{has always been}} about [...] "as fine a fit as a trusty pair of Thom McAn's." [...] Between Warren's [...] "heart-drenched" [...] words and dramatic melody writing and Dion's [...] "potent vocals straight from soulside, divadom has never sounded so mighty." [...] According to him, for fans of Dion's [...] "high-caliber" [...] power ballads, this is truly among the best ever and a highlight on All the Way... A Decade of Song. Longing for romantic attention, Dion sings, [...] "I want you [...] to need me, like the air you breathe/I {{want you to feel}} me, in everything/I want you to see me, in your every dream/The way that I taste you, feel you, breathe you, need you." [...] Taylor stated that Warren's trusty melody is wholly natural and free-flowing, while production from the usually rock-oriented Matt Serletic is [...] "sheer perfection". It all peaks from the glorious midsection through to the end, where Dion delivers exactly what we've come to expect: a crescendo as [...] "spine-tingling" [...] as <b>those</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> times we heard [...] "My Heart Will Go On".|$|E
500|$|Apart from {{a change}} in musical style, the band changed the way they recorded. [...] "It {{was the first time}} we sort of jammed," [...] Coxon revealed. [...] "We've never really jammed before. We've been quite white-coaty, overall about recording, like in a laboratory. Yeah, we did {{actually}} feel our way through just playing whatever came to our minds and editing, which was really exciting." [...] "We just played together for two weeks in a way we hadn't done since 1991," [...] Dave recalls. [...] "We wanted to purify the sound, to not have anything there not played by us. We reasoned that if we made small changes at the input end, we could effect large changes in the output." [...] According to producer Stephen Street, [...] "Blur had decided that commercial pressures and writing hit singles wasn't going to be the main consideration any more. The mood in the studio was very different to when I'd first worked with them." [...] "In the studio, once we got past <b>those</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days, where I felt everyone was treading on eggshells, there was a great atmosphere. I think it was because they didn't want to be competing with anyone on this record, they wanted to make a record that would help keep the band together." [...] Street had acquired a new piece of hardware, described as [...] "muso-ish to talk about but really useful" [...] which enabled him to sample loops and otherwise cut-and-paste entire sections of the band's jam sessions.|$|E

40|$|Leon, ChrysanthiThis project {{integrates}} concepts {{from both}} the fields of law and society and criminology {{as a way of}} creating a more comprehensive theoretical lens in which to examine the reentry process and understand the successes and struggles during <b>those</b> critical <b>first</b> <b>few</b> months following release. Specifically, this study examines how the legal consciousness of returning citizens, experiences of stigma, and the development and maintenance of social bonds work together or individually to impact individuals’ experiences with reentry. Findings from semi-structured interviews with recently incarcerated individuals reveal that each of the three theoretical concepts have numerous relationships to one another as well as a meaningful role in the reentry process. Findings from this project shed light on the real experiences, struggles, and successes of people coming out of prison during the initial weeks and months of returning home. It is hoped that the stories of these men and women will illuminate the ways in which families, communities, policy-makers, and society can assist these individuals as they try to begin their lives as formerly incarcerated adults.

[...] While catching for the Browns, Peitz teamed up with left-handed pitcher Ted Breitenstein, and the pair became known as the [...] "Pretzel Battery."

2500|$|Before {{heading to}} The Plant Studios in Sausalito, California {{to record the}} album, the band spent time with Fortman in pre-production. Gray said [...] "I've found that <b>those</b> <b>first</b> <b>few</b> days are the most {{important}} when it comes to setting the album's tone and challenging the band about their goals and fine-tuning the arrangements for maximum emotional impact." [...] The band rented a ranch in Northern California where they wrote and rehearsed songs for the album. They converted its multi-stall garage into a makeshift studio. As with the band's previous album, Mudvayne chose to isolate themselves to provide inspiration for their songwriting. Matt McDonough stated [...] "Establishing clear goals for each song has been the key to Mudvayne's quick results. It's a strange contradiction, but it can be very liberating to set limitations on creativity as long as you don't let those limitations define you. It frees up a lot of creative energy when you stop pulling an idea in fifty different directions and start pushing it in one." ...|$|E

The story of the kidnapped Hutt was inspired by the Sonny Chiba samurai film titled Shogun’s Shadow. Warner Bros. had tracked the series' development from the beginning, and Lucas decided on a theatrical launch after viewing early footage declaring [...] "This is so beautiful, why don't we just go and use the crew and make a feature?" [...] Lucas described the film was [...] "almost an afterthought." [...] Howard Roffman, president of Lucas Licensing, said of the decision, [...] "Sometimes George works in strange ways." [...] Producer Catherine Winder said the sudden decision added to an already large challenge of establishing a show [...] "of this sophistication and complexity," [...] but she felt it was a good way to start the series, and thought budgetary constraints forced the production team to think outside the box in a positive way.|$|E

The eight total Dickens adaptations were produced during two years. At the same time, in 1983, the company produced a short series of adaptations of Sherlock Holmes stories, adapted from the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In the years that followed, until 1988, Burbank adapted the works of many other well-known authors and legends, including Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows, Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote, J.
