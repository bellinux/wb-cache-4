According to The Daily Telegraph, before her marriage, Susan was [...] "a beauty queen turned lingerie model" [...] who [...] "launched a fashion business". The couple met in Spain, where Susan had a bridal wear company, when Gunn was there on holiday. She told the Telegraph, [...] "When I first met Bryan, I knew nothing about football and {{had no idea who}} he was because he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a joiner." ...|$|E
500|$|Inspired by the {{aspirations}} of Knowles's father Mathew, the album was titled after Hadley Street, a plot of land in downtown Houston: [...] "My father took me there one day and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{going to build a}} studio," [...] {{she said in an interview}} with the Daily Mail. [...] "The title is a tribute to his vision. He had a plan and he saw it through. That was a real eye-opener for me. It inspired me to dig out my old Marvin Gaye albums and start writing songs." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{childhood}} friend of Manning's, speaking about a conversation they had when Manning was 13, said: [...] "he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> gay." [...] The friend {{also said that}} Manning's home life was not good and that her father was very controlling. Around this time, Manning's parents divorced. She and her mother Susan {{moved out of the}} house to a rented apartment in Crescent, Oklahoma. Susan's instability continued, and in 1998 she attempted suicide; Manning's sister drove their mother to the hospital, with the 11-year-old Manning sitting {{in the back of the}} car trying to make sure their mother was still breathing.|$|E

500|$|According to Paul Hornsby, {{who played}} with Duane Allman in Hour Glass in 1967–1968 before the Allman Brothers Band, [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] {{inspired}} Allman to take up slide guitar. [...] After hearing Beck's record, Allman [...] "loved that slide part and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going {{to learn to play}} it", Hornsby recalled. [...] In 1970, Joe Walsh adapted the slide-guitar section of [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] for a James Gang song. [...] Titled [...] "The Bomber", the multi-part suite also includes a rendition of Ravel's Boléro and appears on the James Gang Rides Again album. [...] Several artists have recorded renditions of [...] "Beck's Bolero", including SRC, the Posies, Les Fradkin, Eric Johnson, and Return to Forever.|$|E
500|$|Boulding was {{tracked by}} Bradford City and Crewe Alexandra, {{with whom he}} was offered a {{contract}} after a successful trial, but instead decided to retire from professional football after being asked {{to play on the}} left wing. Crewe manager Dario Gradi said: [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to retire because he didn't want to sit on the bench all season—or drop down the divisions." [...] His retirement lasted seven months while he worked for his father's company until he joined Rotherham United in March 2006 following three reserve games. He signed {{for the rest of the}} 2005–06 season, but did not make any first-team appearances for Rotherham and left the club at the end of the season.|$|E
500|$|As the 1915 {{season was}} set to get underway, Coach Yost reported, [...] "Johnny <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> feeling fine when I saw him recently, {{although}} he doesn’t weigh {{as much as he}} used to." [...] Despite Yost's hopes, Maulbetsch fell far short of the prior year's performance in 1915. [...] He was several pounds lighter after the illness and surgery, and it was noted that [...] "a few pounds means much to a man of Maulbetsch's weight." [...] In the opening game against Lawrence, Maulbetsch scored three touchdowns, but he was [...] "woefully weak on interference." [...] Playing against Mount Union, Maulbetsch made several big gains, including a 50-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. [...] His difficulties returned in the season's third game against Marietta, as [...] "Maulbetsch was powerless to stop the Marietta forward pass, all of the successful ones being directed toward his side of the line." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 10, 2014, {{a lawsuit}} against Zayat was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The plaintiff, Howard Rubinsky, was an {{associate}} of the Jelinskys who had also pleaded guilty in the illegal betting operation. His suit alleged breach of contract, claiming that Zayat failed to pay off a $1.65 million line of credit in 2004. Rubinsky said he extended credit to Zayat with Tradewinds Sportsbook so Zayat could bet on horse races via a gambling website set up in Costa Rica. Zayat's lawyer described the suit as [...] "a meritless claim", filed a motion to dismiss in 2015 alleging lack of evidence, and argued that {{the statute of limitations}} of six years had run. Zayat stated in court documents that he had met and loaned money to Rubinsky, but said, [...] "I can say unequivocally that I did not give Mr. Rubinsky any money as payment on any debt ... I agreed to give him money because he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> ill and broke." [...] On June 4, 2015, a federal judge in Newark, New Jersey, dismissed Rubinsky's lawsuit, citing both Rubinsky's difficulty in proving his case and the expired statute of limitations. In a related matter, June 1, 2015, days before American Pharoah was to run in the 2015 Belmont Stakes, the New York Times reported that Rubinsky's lawyer, Joseph Bainton, filed a $10-million libel suit against Zayat for comments to the press, including the characterization of Rubinsky's other lawsuit as [...] "extortion, a fraud and blackmail." [...] That suit was dismissed on August 5, 2015.|$|E
2500|$|According to Rice, the {{decision}} not to respond militarily to the Cole bombing was President Bush's. She said he [...] "made clear to us {{that he did not want}} to respond to al Qaeda one attack at a time. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> 'tired of swatting flies.'" [...] The administration instead began work on a new strategy to eliminate al-Qaeda.|$|E
2500|$|Black Flag played {{its final}} show on June 27, 1986, in Detroit, Michigan. In his book Get in the Van, Rollins wrote that Ginn telephoned him in August 1986: [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> quitting the band. I {{thought that was}} strange {{considering}} it was his band and all. So in one short phone call, it was all over." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{employee}} at La Maison Bleue, his hotel, was quoted by Agence France Presse: [...] "When {{he came in}} , he was drunk. He was with a Senegalese woman and he planned to stay one night.

2500|$|Although White and Stieglitz {{had tried}} to {{reconcile}} their differences before White died, Stieglitz never forgave White for breaking from him in 1912. Upon hearing about White's untimely death, Stieglitz wrote to Kuehn, [...] "Poor White. Cares and vexation. When I last saw him he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not {{able to cope with}} [...] twenty years ago. I reminded him that I warned him to stay in business in Ohio ‒ New York would be too much for him. But the Photo-Session beckoned. Vanity and ambitions. His photography went to the devil." [...] In spite of these words, Stieglitz had 49 of White's photographs, including 18 created jointly with Stieglitz, in his personal collection when he died.|$|E
2500|$|As {{an energy}} {{lobbyist}} in 1975, Shell fought the attempt of Governor Jerry Brown {{to repeal the}} [...] "depletion allowance," [...] a tax break for the state's oil industry. Brown aimed his fire at [...] "big oil" [...] {{in an era of}} popular environmental activism on the West Coast. The decisive vote against the allowance was cast in the California Senate by the usually pro-business Republican Senator Robert S. Stevens. Shell claimed that Stevens had promised him that he would support keeping the allowance: [...] "He had shaken my hand and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> with me." [...] recalled Shell, who considered a handshake a bond of honor. Brown later rewarded Stevens with a judicial appointment, but Stevens was driven from the bench for making salacious telephone calls.|$|E

2500|$|During the First World War, Allenby {{initially}} {{served on}} the Western Front. At the outbreak of war in August 1914, a British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent to France. It consisted of four infantry divisions and one cavalry division, the latter commanded by Allenby. The cavalry division first saw action in semi-chaotic circumstances covering the retreat after the Battle of Mons opposing the German Army's invasion of France. One of Allenby's subordinates claimed at the time: [...] "He cannot explain verbally, with any lucidity at all, what his plans are". When a headquarters officer asked why a cavalry brigade was miles from where {{it was supposed to}} be, he received the reply: [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> getting as far away from the Bull as possible. It was a most scandalous affair, and he was in almost open rebellion against Allenby at the time". The division distinguished itself under Allenby's direction in the subsequent fighting, with minimal resources at its disposal, at the First Battle of Ypres.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project was}} {{supported}} by Pennsylvania Governor John S. Fisher and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Governor Fisher was an old friend and ally of McCreight, and together they labored for many years on the Cook Forest conservation project. [...] Both were “farm-boy” bankers who grew up near the Great Shamokin Path of the Seneca, knew the forests and believed in conservation. It was not until Fisher was elected Governor that the Cook Forest Bill was finally passed and signed on April 14, 1927. Governor Fisher supported McCreight’s proposal. “The Governor has written me that he is greatly interested {{in the use of}} the park for the home of the native Red Folks, and I think the plan can be worked out. [...] My suggestion is that Good Face, and with William Spotted Tail with his family, and John Sitting Bull, and others who would suit with my old friend Flying Hawk who lives at Rockyford.” McCreight, forever the dedicated public educator, saw yet another opportunity for [...] "Young America". “The Eastern people, especially the younger generation, are greatly interested in the Indians and to have a few of the old time names of whom they have read in history, it would add to their desire to know more of them. [...] Anyway, the American People owe the Indians a lot and there is nothing that I know of that would be finer, than to make a nice home for them in this great natural forest where they once lived and which was theirs before the whites came and it is the one piece of land that is just the same as it was when the original red men lived there. [...] Like all parks in the north, it would not be necessary for them to remain in it in the winter, likely they could go back and forth as it appealed to them. [...] Of course there are plenty of Indians that would be glad to get the chance to come, but not all are desired by any means. [...] I know Commissioner of Indian Affairs Charles H. Burke and will of course consult with him if the plan seems to be practical in other ways. [...] I would like, first to know whether the plan would appeal to the Indians themselves, the ones I have in mind to have for it. [...] Possibly you could see Spotted Tail too. [...] Good Face has been here before. [...] He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> at my house nearly thirty years ago. [...] Now that you understand what I have in mind, there are others who might be just as desirable to those mentioned, in your country, and I wish you would think about it and write me again how you regard it, and with any suggestions you might have considering the plan.” In February 1929, the Superintendent of the Pine Ridge Agency, Indian Field Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior contacted McCreight that “two families have signified their willingness to go if proper arrangements can be made and a contract and bond furnished.” [...] McCreight’s vision of Lakota living and working at Cook Forest was endorsed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and families were ready to move to the great forest along the Clarion River. However, when the stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, with the onset of the Great Depression, the Lakota project at Cook Forest was shelved.|$|E
