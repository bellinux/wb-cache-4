5|$|To {{keep costs}} down while {{ensuring}} sufficient longevity, Sega opted to create the platform from popular off-the-shelf components. The first model <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> was actually the SC-3000, a computer version with a built-in keyboard, but when Sega learned of Nintendo's plans to release a games-only console, they began developing the SG-1000 alongside the SC-3000.|$|E

On February 15, 2005, Midway Games announced plans to develop and produce a new Dexter's Laboratory video game for multiple consoles, but the game never saw the light of day.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} species of Cyathus produce {{metabolites}} with biological activity, and novel chemical structures that are specific to this genus. For example, cyathins are diterpenoid compounds produced by C.helenae, C.africanus and C.earlei. Several of the cyathins (especially cyathins B3 and C3), including striatin compounds from C.striatus, show strong antibiotic activity. Cyathane diterpenoids also stimulate nerve growth factor synthesis, and have the potential <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> into therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Compounds named cyathuscavins, isolated from the mycelial liquid culture of C.stercoreus, have significant antioxidant activity, as do the compounds known as cyathusals, also from C.stercoreus. Various sesquiterpene compounds have also been identified in C.bulleri, including cybrodol (derived from humulene), nidulol, and bullerone.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 80 {{percent of the}} Abrahams Creek {{watershed}} is rural and 20 percent is urbanized. The lower reaches of the watershed contain most of the urbanization. Its upper reaches contain second-growth forest, small patches of residential land, linear hedgerows, and agricultural land such as hay pastures, pastures, and farmland. The Bunker Hill-Mount Lookout Ridge is too steep <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed,</b> but many {{other areas of the}} watershed could easily be urbanized. The mining-affected land in the watershed is in West Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of The Jazz Singer, all the major film {{companies}} were racing to hire audio engineers so they could record and reproduce sound for film. Through common acquaintances at Electrical Research Products, Inc. (ERPI) within Western Electric, Hilliard was contacted and hired by United Artists Studios (UA) in Hollywood, California in 1928 because of his studies in physics, engineering and acoustics. Having left his Masters studies behind in Minnesota, Hilliard, not yet 28 years old, supervised all sound recording for Coquette, UA's first talking motion picture. Western Electric provided recording equipment, but the specific techniques for achieving best sound on film had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> by hard work and imagination. Hilliard's ground-breaking methods later became industry standards.|$|E

5|$|Air-Cobot is {{presented}} as the first robot able to perform visual inspections of aircraft. Inspection robots using other types of sensors have been considered before, such as the European project Robair. Since {{the launch of the}} project, other solutions based on image processing began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed,</b> such as EasyJet with a drone or the swarm of drones from Toulouse company Donecle or the Aircam project of the aerospace manufacturer Airbus.|$|E
5|$|As Jesus vs. Santa {{became more}} popular, Parker and Stone began talks of {{developing}} the short into a television series. Fox refused {{to pick up the}} series, not wanting to air a show that included the character Mr. Hankey, a talking piece of feces. The two then entered negotiations with both MTV and Comedy Central. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids show. When Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog watched the short, he commissioned for it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> into a series.|$|E
5|$|As {{oil prices}} rose during the 1990s, Fairbanks' economy improved. The city was also boosted by the {{regrowth}} of gold mining in the area. The Fort Knox Gold Mine north of Fairbanks opened in 1997 {{after several years}} of development, and another gold prospect is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> in the next decade. The same year that Fort Knox Mine opened, Alyeska moved 300 jobs from Anchorage to Fairbanks, making the city the base of its operations {{for the first time in}} several decades.|$|E

5|$|As {{opposed to}} the VZ and all models {{previous}} which used Opel-sourced platforms adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market, the whole-new VE programme is the first Commodore <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> exclusively by Holden in Australia. Despite its status as an all-new model, engines—comprising the 3.6-litre V6 and more powerful 6.0-litre V8—have been largely carried over from the VZ series. Innovative features to help minimise export redevelopment costs, such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush-fitting hand brake lever, facilitate the conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the VE was badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Omega and Pontiac G8.|$|E
5|$|Burr {{was quickly}} called to Canada's Naval Services Headquarters {{to discuss how}} to apply {{diffused}} lighting camouflage. Simple tests in the laboratory served as proof of concept. In January 1941, sea trials began on the new corvette HMCS Cobalt. She was fitted with ordinary light projectors—neither designed for robustness, nor waterproofed—on temporary supports {{on one side of}} the hull; brightness was controlled manually. The trial was sufficiently promising for a better prototype <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Coolsma {{found that}} Sundanese {{literature}} consisted predominantly of poetry, including the narrative wawacan, {{and thought that}} prose needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> as well so that the people would embrace modernity. He considered that they rarely read, instead preferring to listen to more educated persons sing in verse. As such, the contents of written prose would not be conveyed. This {{is not to say}} that he disliked Sundanese poetry; he was appreciative of the dangding verse forms– derived from Javanese literary tradition– which were used to write wawacan, and considered an existing translation of the Gospel of Matthew in dangding to be the best Sundanese-language book in print.|$|E
