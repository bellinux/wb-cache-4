2500|$|Van Steenbergen {{returned}} in 1946 and won again. He said: [...] "That {{was one of}} my best wins ever. I could do whatever I liked, ride better than anyone. In the end I was with Briek Schotte and Enkel Thiétard. They were happy just <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>me.</b> We made an agreement. I said that they could stay with me until we got to Kwatrecht. I wouldn't drop them provided they'd do their best to work with me. They were happy with that. They didn't have a choice. Under the bridge at Kwatrecht I just got rid of them." ...|$|E

Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu led their troops towards Nan Commandery and were separated from Cao Ren's forces by the river. Liu Bei told Zhou Yu, [...] "Cao Ren is defending Jiangling and he has much supplies in the city. He poses a big threat to us.

60|$|In {{front of}} them upon a small mat lay an {{earthenware}} pitcher of water and half-a-loaf of bread, together with {{a sheet of paper}} inscribed with certain cabalistic characters. Ram Singh glanced at these, and then, motioning <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> withdraw, <b>followed</b> <b>me</b> out into the garden.|$|R
60|$|On {{my return}} to London, whither I went by mail direct, leaving the yacht <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> after <b>me,</b> I drove {{straight}} to the Lathams' from Waterloo Station. Mrs. Latham was out, the servant said, but Miss Irene was in the drawing-room.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{he said in}} a {{disturbed}} voice. [...] "Still, {{it looked}} as if I couldn't go on with the thing.

6000|$|... "I have come," [...] {{replied the}} ruddy Pretender, [...] "to defy you, ay, proud Sandys, to {{challenge}} thee to the deed thou pratest of. I {{go from here}} <b>to</b> my Lair. <b>Follow</b> <b>me,</b> if thou darest!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The game's up and I'm {{out of it}}! Take {{my advice}} and clear out of it too, until {{you can come back}} in better shape. Don't be such a fool as <b>to</b> try and <b>follow</b> <b>me.</b> Your father isn't one, and that's where you've slipped up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could always}} {{get as many}} as I wanted <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> <b>me</b> anywhere, senorita. I {{ought to have been}} made an officer, because I can read and write." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, it can't be him, for I locked him in myself. He {{walks in}} his sleep sometimes, and I was afraid he'd startle my lady. Let him sleep; this would only excite him and set him <b>to</b> marching again. <b>Follow</b> <b>me,</b> Bedford and James, I'm not afraid of ghosts or rogues." ...|$|R
60|$|Delcarte and Taylor {{immediately}} {{assured me}} {{that they had not}} for an instant assumed anything different, and that they were as ready <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> and obey <b>me</b> here as they would be upon the other side of thirty.|$|R

[...] "Mr. Vanstone is ready <b>to</b> receive you. <b>Follow</b> <b>me,</b> if you please, Miss Garth." [...] With these words she opened the door, and led the way out of the room.|$|R
40|$|Of {{the many}} {{interesting}} insights in the Auslander-Bridger Memoir of 1969, {{the theory of}} Gorenstein dimension has most often been taken up by commutative algebraists. Over a local ring, it deals with resolutions by modules which are totally reflexive with regard to free modules. For some years now, one {{has been trying to}} replace frees by semidualizing modules. This has met with success, and more is <b>to</b> <b>follow.</b> <b>To</b> <b>me</b> however, it makes sense to first try and understand semidualizing modules themselves better. This note shows in a direct way that they share many properties with free modules. One hopes that this will help to make the developing theory more natural and transparent.
