2500|$|The {{association}} of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and the eye disease glaucoma was first described by Englishman Richard Bannister in 1622: [...] "...that the Eye be grown more solid and hard, then naturally it should be...". Angle-closure glaucoma {{was treated with}} cataract extraction by John Collins Warren in Boston as early as 1806. [...] The invention of the ophthalmoscope by Hermann Helmholtz in 1851 enabled ophthalmologists {{for the first time}} to identify the pathological hallmark of glaucoma, the excavation of the optic nerve head due to retinal ganglion cell loss. The first reliable instrument to measure intraocular pressure was invented by Norwegian ophthalmologist Hjalmar August Schiøtz in 1905. About half a century later, Hans Goldmann in Berne, Switzerland, developed his applanation <b>tonometer</b> which still today - despite numerous new innovations in diagnostics - is considered the gold standard of determining this crucial pathogenic factor. In the late 20th century, further pathomechanisms beyond elevated IOP were discovered and became the subject of research like insufficient blood supply – often associated with low or irregular blood pressure – to the retina and optic nerve head.|$|E
50|$|The Perkins <b>tonometer</b> {{is a type}} of {{portable}} applanation <b>tonometer,</b> which may be useful in children, anesthetised patients who need to lie flat, or patients unable to co-operate with a sitting slit lamp examination, that yields clinical results comparable to the Goldmann.|$|E
50|$|Schiøtz <b>tonometer</b> is an {{indentation}} <b>tonometer,</b> used {{to measure}} the intraocular pressure (IOP) by measuring the depth produced {{on the surface of the}} cornea by a load of a known weight. The indentation of corneal surface is indirectly proportional to the IOP.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{indentation}} <b>tonometers</b> are modified Mackay-Marg <b>tonometers</b> {{that use}} a free floating transducer {{to detect the}} transmitted pressure. The transducer is surrounded by an outer ring that flattens the adjacent cornea reducing its influence on measurement. Because the device touches the cornea, topical anesthetic eye drops are used to numb the eye but as with non-contact tonometry, these devices are often used in children and non-cooperative patients because of their portability and ease of use. Portable electronic <b>tonometers</b> also {{play a major role}} in veterinary tonometry.|$|R
40|$|THE {{purpose of}} this paper is to set out the steps which led to the first attempt to {{establish}} the standardization of <b>tonometers</b> in Great Britain, and to des-cribe the method by which it is proposed that such standardization shall be achieved. Acknowledgment must here be made to those upon whose detailed pre-liminary work the present project is freely based, and many of whose tech-niques and ideas are incorporated herein. Of first importance in this connec-tion is the American Academy of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology, whose Committee on Standardization of <b>Tonometers</b> has gone far to arrive at a solution of many of the problems involved. Dr. Jonas S.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess {{agreement}} between two commercially available applanation <b>tonometers</b> for the measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP). Forty subjects underwent IOP measurement on two accurately calibrated Goldmann type applanation <b>tonometers</b> (Zeiss AT 030 (GATZ) and Inami L- 5110 (GATI)). The order of examination was randomized and observers were masked to the IOP recorded. The mean of two consecutive readings, from a randomly selected eye for each subject, was used for analysis. Agreement was assessed using the Altman and Bland plot. The mean (SD) IOP readings on GATZ was 15. 32 (&#x 00 B 1; 6. 80) mm Hg and on GATI was 13. 52 (&#x 00 B 1; 5. 65) mm Hg (p&# 60; 0. 001, 95 &#x 0025; CI of the difference: - 2. 48 to - 1. 11). The 95 &#x 0025; limits of agreement on the Altman and Bland plot were:- 2. 47 to 6. 16 mm Hg). There was significant inter-instrument variability between the two accurately calibrated Goldmann type applanation <b>tonometers</b> studied...|$|R

50|$|Non-contact {{tonometry}} (or air-puff tonometry) {{is different}} from pneumatonometry and was invented by Bernard Grolman of Reichert, Inc (formerly American Optical). It uses a rapid air pulse to applanate (flatten) the cornea. Corneal applanation is detected via an electro-optical system. Intraocular pressure is estimated by detecting {{the force of the}} air jet at the instance of applanation. Historically, non-contact <b>tonometers</b> were not considered to be an accurate way to measure IOP but instead a fast and simple way to screen for high IOP. However, modern non-contact <b>tonometers</b> have been shown to correlate well with Goldmann tonometry measurements and are particularly useful for measuring IOP in children and other non-compliant patient groups.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of new <b>tonometers</b> requires laboratory tests on enucleated eyes where the intraocular pressure (IOP) is usually controlled {{by the use of}} a fluid column (manometry). This article describes a novel eye pressure regulation system for IOP tests along with a new concept of mechanical palpation tonome-try. Manometry is commonly regarded as an invasive technique that can measure precisely the pressure inside the eye. It is a common laboratory technique for evaluating changes in IOP over time, and for providing reference pressure by which all other <b>tonometers</b> can be evaluated. In general, the system consists of a fluid column (1 % saline solution) connected via PVC tubing to a three way valve. The valve is able to connect the column branch to a syringe with a 21 G needle inserted into the vitreous humor and to a pressure transducer. The syringe needle is inserted i...|$|R

50|$|Rebound <b>tonometers</b> {{determine}} {{intraocular pressure}} by bouncing {{a small plastic}} tipped metal probe against the cornea. The device uses an induction coil to magnetise the probe and fire it against the cornea. As the probe bounces against the cornea {{and back into the}} device, it creates an induction current from which the intraocular pressure is calculated. The device is simple and easy to use and self-use versions are available. It is portable, does not require the use of eye drops and is particularly suitable for children and non-cooperative patients.|$|R

40|$|Two {{different}} methods of assessing {{the reliability of}} the oxygen electrode of one model of an automatic blood gas analyser (BGA) have been studied. In the first, a single automatic BGA was assessed by using outdated bank blood which was pumped around a small extracorporeal circuit into which known gas mixtures were passed. Oxygen tension was varied between 2 and 16 kPa.

Linear regression analysis showed a significant correlation between the two methods of measuring PCO 2 (r 2 = 0. 43; P < 0. 0001). However, gastric juice PCO 2 was systematically higher (mean difference 51 mmHg). The 95 % limits of agreement were 315 mmHg and the dispersion increased as the values of PCO 2 increased.

40|$|Glaucoma, {{caused by}} an {{elevated}} intraocular pressure (IOP), {{is one of the}} leading causes of blindness. As constant monitoring of IOP is essential in the treatment of glaucoma, the IOP measurement techniques described in patents and patent applications since 1950 are examined. None of the methods provides a simple and comfortable approach for patients to self monitor their IOPs at different times throughout the day.

50|$|Transpalpebral {{tonometry}} {{refers to}} methods of measuring intraocular pressure through the eyelid.

The patient is positioned so that {{the tip of the}} device and lid are overlying sclera. Non-corneal and transpalpebral tonometry does not involve contact with the cornea and does not require topical anesthetic during routine use. Transpalpebral tonometry may be useful for measuring postsurgery IOP after myopic LASIK ablation because this technique is not influenced by the treatment. The Diaton <b>tonometer</b> still requires further evaluation and is not a substitute or alternative for more established methods. The Diaton <b>tonometer</b> has a large margin of error compared with commonly used tonometers (e.g., GAT) in most patients (including those with ocular hypertension, glaucoma, and glaucoma tube shunts).|$|E

50|$|Many {{computerized}} wristwatches {{have been}} developed, but none have had long-term sales success, {{because they have}} awkward user interfaces due to the tiny screens and buttons, and a short battery life. As miniaturized electronics became cheaper, watches have been developed containing calculators, <b>tonometers,</b> barometers, altimeters, a compass using both hands to show the N/S direction, video games, digital cameras, keydrives, GPS receivers and cellular phones. A few astronomical watches show phase of the Moon and other celestial phenomena. In the early 1980s Seiko marketed a watch with a television in it. Such watches have also had the reputation as unsightly and thus mainly geek toys. Several companies have however attempted to develop a computer contained in a wristwatch (see also wearable computer).|$|R
50|$|The {{thickness}} of the cornea affects most non-invasive methods by varying resistance to the <b>tonometer</b> probe. A thick cornea {{gives rise to a}} greater probability of an IOP being overestimated (and a thin cornea of an IOP being underestimated), but the extent of measurement error in individual patients cannot be ascertained from the CCT alone. The Ocular Response Analyzer and Pascal DCT Tonometers are less affected by CCT than the Goldmann <b>tonometer.</b> Conversely, non-contact and rebound tonometers are more affected. Corneal thickness varies among individuals as well as with age and race. It is reduced in certain disease and following LASIK surgery.|$|E

50|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} measuring PWV utilizes the {{feature of the}} arterial waveform that during late diastole and early systole, there is no, or minimal, interference of the incident pressure wave by the reflected pressure wave. With this assumption, PWV can be measured between two sites a known distance apart using the pressure `foot' of the waveform to calculate the transit time. Exactly locating the pressure waveform foot can be subjective and less than accurate. The advantage of foot-to-foot PWV measurement is the simplicity of measurement, requiring only two pressure wave forms recorded with invasive catheters, or mechanical <b>tonometers</b> or pulse detection devices applied non-invasively to the pulse across the skin, where {{the site of the}} two measurements are a known distance apart.|$|R
