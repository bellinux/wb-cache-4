5000|$|Further {{investigations}} {{found that}} <b>taxilane</b> and taxiway rutting {{was caused by}} separation of the asphalt binder from the aggregate surface due to prolonged water infiltration into the asphalt concrete base course, a phenomenon known as [...] "stripping." [...] The 23 cm thick base course is the top-most layer of the tarmac. Core samples indicated that the concrete base course material contained the correct job mix and aggregate gradation. Below the base course are the binder course, and the cement-treated base.|$|E
50|$|The Engineering Institute of Thailand (EIT) {{conducted}} investigations at {{the airport}} in late 2006 after signs of distress were spotted at several locations in Suvarnabhumi's taxiways and <b>taxilanes.</b> Rutting was found in five of the six <b>taxilanes</b> and one of the six taxiways. Plastic deformation of the asphalt wearing course was observed near the takeoff position of the runway. However, the investigators noted that plastic deformation at this location was a common phenomenon and only routine maintenance was required to repair the distress. Aside from this surface distortion, both runways were in good structural condition.|$|R
40|$|Cairns International Airport’s {{domestic}} {{parking apron}} was originally designed for 300 and 400 series B 737 and occasional larger aircraft. With {{the development of}} the terminal and increased passenger movements, the apron is expected to be subject to increased frequency of heavier B 737 - 800 aircraft as well as regular operations by larger aircraft, including the A 330, B 747 and B 787. The apron required upgrading to accommodate this increased pavement loading. To minimise disruption and cost, only the parking positions and access <b>taxilanes</b> were to be upgraded. An investigation into the most appropriate type of pavement for the proposed work concluded that a rigid concrete pavement was preferred. Other pavement options considered included traditional asphalt surfaced flexible pavement and segmental concrete block paver surfaced flexible pavement. Each pavement was considered against the following selection criteria which were determined in consultation with the Cairns Port Authority: • Construction cost. • Whole of life cost. • Constructability. • Construction time. • Reliability. Rigid concrete pavement was found to be superior to all other pavement types with regard to constructability in the confined areas proposed. It was also found to be satisfactory with regard to construction time. Whilst having the highest capital cost, rigid concrete pavement was considered to present the lowest whole of life cost based on its longer design life and reduced pavement maintenance requirements. Rigid concrete pavement was approved as the preferred pavement type for the upgrade work, which is now under construction...|$|R
