In reaction, Captain Marvel places Morales under arrest. While Iron Man and Captain Marvel argue the merits of arresting Morales, Rogers gives Morales the {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> himself and Morales asks to go home. As Morales leaves, Maria Hill places Iron Man's team under arrest but Doctor Strange teleports them to one of Nick Fury's safehouses. At the safehouse, the younger Avengers sneak off to find Morales before the adults. Meanwhile, Hill receives communication that Morales is at the United States Capitol, the location seen in Ulysses' vision.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the issue}} of the papal bull Clericis laicos in 1296, forbidding the payment of taxes to a secular power, Winchelsey urged his clergy in 1297 to refuse {{payments}} to Edward. However, the clergy of the province of York paid a tax of a fifth of their revenues. Edward then declared clerics who refused to pay outlaws, and ordered their property to be seized. He conceded that the clergy could return to his protection if they paid a fine of a fifth of their revenues, exactly what the northern clergy had offered in the way of taxation. The royal clerks and many other clergy paid the fines, and in March, the southern clergy met again, and after a long debate, Winchelsey instructed each clerk <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> himself whether or not to pay the fine. It appears that most chose to pay, but the archbishop still refused to make any contribution, and so Edward seized his lands. They were returned to him in July 1297, when the king and prelate were reconciled at Westminster. Winchelsey then tried to mediate between Edward and the earls, who also objected to Edward's tax demands.|$|E
5|$|Zito {{wanted to}} put {{together}} some demos to present the technology to Hasbro. Riley wanted {{to create an environment}} the player could move freely about, leading to the idea of surveillance cameras. Fulop and Riley were inspired by the play Tamara (1981) which ran parallel stories running in 13 different rooms. The audience would need <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> themselves which stories they wanted to follow. Fulop and Riley watched the play three times {{over the course of a}} weekend in 1985. Fulop and Riley liked the design model and thought it would make a good basis for an interactive media experience. A prototype game titled Scene of the Crime was produced to demonstrate the new technology to Hasbro and test the surveillance camera gameplay. It was a short five-minute demo where the player follows suspicious characters around a house to find who stole a stash of money. The player switches between cameras to observe the characters and eavesdrop on their conversations; all the characters have a plot to steal the money. At the end of the game, the player must guess who stole the money. In December 1986, the team flew to Hasbro headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and pitched the technology to Hasbro CEO Stephen Hassenfeld and a board room of 22 executives who liked the system and gave funding to support further development for the technology and games.|$|E

25|$|In general, one can {{say that}} the {{processes}} to make PET bottle flakes from collected bottles are as versatile as the different waste streams are different in their composition and quality. In view of technology there isn't just one way to do it.

Euthanasia is currently legal in the states of Washington DC, California, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. Around the world there are different organizations that campaign to change legislation about the issue of physician assisted death, or PAD. Examples of such organizations are the Hemlock Society of the United States and the Dignity in Dying campaign in the United Kingdom. These groups believe that doctors should be given the right to end a patient’s life only if the patient is conscious enough <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> themselves, is knowledgeable about the possibility of alternative care, and has willingly asked to end their life or requested access to the means to do so.|$|E

25|$|The Compromise of 1850 {{allowed the}} territories of Utah and New Mexico <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> or against slavery, {{but it also}} allowed the {{admission}} of California as a free state, reduced {{the size of the}} slave state of Texas by adjusting the boundary, and ended the slave trade (but not slavery itself) in the District of Columbia. In return, the South got a stronger fugitive slave law than the version mentioned in the Constitution. Whereas Douglas said that the Compromise of 1850 replaced the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery in the Louisiana Purchase territory north and west of the state of Missouri, Lincoln said that this was false, and that Popular Sovereignty and the Dred Scott decision were a departure from the policies of the past that would nationalize slavery.|$|E
25|$|The {{victory of}} the United States over Mexico {{resulted}} in the addition of large new territories conquered from Mexico. Controversy over whether these territories would be slave or free raised {{the risk of a}} war between slave and free states, and Northern support for the Wilmot Proviso, which would have banned slavery in the conquered territories, increased sectional tensions. The controversy was temporarily resolved by the Compromise of 1850, which allowed the territories of Utah and New Mexico <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> or against slavery, but also allowed the admission of California as a free state, reduced the size of the slave state of Texas by adjusting the boundary, and ended the slave trade (but not slavery itself) in the District of Columbia. In return, the South got a stronger fugitive slave law than the version mentioned in the Constitution. The Fugitive Slave Law would reignite controversy over slavery.|$|E
25|$|Membership of {{the various}} Methodist {{branches}} peaked at 841,000 in 1910, then fell steadily to 425,000 in 1990 and only 202,000 in 2014. The {{second half of the}} 19th century saw many of the small schisms reunited to become the United Methodist Free Churches and a further union in 1907 with the Methodist New Connexion and Bible Christian Church brought the United Methodist Church into being. In 1908 the major three branches were the Wesleyan Methodists, the Primitive Methodists and the United Methodists. After the late 19th century evangelical approaches to the unchurched were less effective and less used. Methodists paid more attention to their current membership, and less to outreach, while middle-class family size shrank steadily. There were fewer famous preachers or outstanding leaders. The theological change that emphasised the conversion experience as being a one-time lifetime event rather than as a step on the road to perfection lessened the importance of the class meeting and made revivals less meaningful. The growth mechanisms that had worked so well in the expansion phase in the early 19th century were largely discarded, including revivals and the personal appeal <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> Christ class meetings, as well as the love feast, the Sunday night prayer-meeting, and the open-air meeting. The failure to grow was signaled by the flagging experience of the Sunday schools, whose enrollments fell steadily.|$|E

500|$|According to Gamasutra's Matt Barton, {{some have}} argued that these changes put Morrowind closer in spirit to the {{original}} Dungeons & Dragons tabletop game, where players take a more creative role in their play, and where players are left <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> themselves the [...] "right" [...] action. This is a view paralleled by Rolston, who has stated that [...] "The goal of every [...] game is to create something that resembles a pen and paper RPG on the computer." [...] The sheer number of quest possibilities, combined with what developer Ken Rolston identified as a lack of [...] "narrative urgency", left many critics dissatisfied with the main plot.

When {{the issue of}} slavery was in the courts, it “was always treated as an existing institution and its legality went unchallenged.” Early Hoosiers, including William Henry Harrison, wanted to have slavery legalized in the new territory. Harrison may have been motivated {{by the need to}} appease existing slaveowners, the need for labor in a developing territory, or the desire to attract immigrants from southern colonies. [...] They sought passage of a new law to override the Northwest Ordinance's ban on slavery. Harrison succeeded in getting permission from Congress for the territory <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>for</b> itself whether slavery should be legalized. Harrison and his party sought to gradually legalize slavery three times (1803, 1807, and 1809) but all three efforts ultimately failed.
