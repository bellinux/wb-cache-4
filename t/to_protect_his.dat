However, there have been claims that this trust was intended primarily <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>his</b> interests in land, of which some was obtained by dubious interpretation of law.|$|E

5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money.
