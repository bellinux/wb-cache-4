2500|$|Journalist/critic Frank Lovece in Newsday contrasted {{the humor}} {{tradition}} of Groening's two series, finding that, [...] "The Simpsons echoes {{the strains of}} American-Irish vaudeville humor— the beer-soaked, sneaking-in-late-while-the-wife's-asleep comedy of Harrigan and Hart, McNulty and Murray, the Four Cohans (which, yes, included George M.) and countless others: knockabout yet sentimental, and ultimately about the bonds of blood family. Futurama, conversely, stems from Jewish-American humor, {{and not just in}} the obvious archetype of Dr. Zoidberg. From vaudeville to the Catskills to Woody Allen, it's that distinctly rueful humor built to ward away everything from despair to petty annoyance— the 'You gotta do what you gotta do' philosophy that helps the 'Futurama' characters cope in a mega-corporate world where <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>guy</b> is essentially powerless." [...] Animation maven Jerry Beck concurred: [...] "I'm Jewish, and I know what you're saying. Fry has that , Dr. Zoidberg, all the [...] Billy West characters. I see it.

Anderson's high school coach Bob Hurley said, [...] "I think he's a modern-day Magic Johnson. I think that let him play the point. He gets everybody shots. You don’t have him back defensively balancing the floor, you’re wasting him. But you let him {{do a lot of}} what the point guard stuff entails. But then also defensively you don’t bother guarding him on <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>guy.</b> Put him on maybe the three man or even sometimes the four man if he’s a step-out player. And now you have a guy like Larry Bird who anticipates. He gets a lot of deflections and steals. He’s long, he blocks shots. And then when he gets a defensive rebound, you got a fast-break started already." [...] During his sophomore year in UCLA, CBSSports.com wrote that Anderson was [...] "starting to look more and more like the Magic Johnson of the 2013–14 season in college basketball." [...] ESPN analyst Dick Vitale warned against calling him the next Magic Johnson, but stated that [...] "he has the mini-version of that kind of skill.” USA Today commented that he was [...] "kind of a poor man's Magic Johnson".|$|E
2500|$|Milo Goes to College {{is cited}} {{as one of}} the most {{significant}} albums of the early-1980s southern California hardcore punk movement. Steven Blush, author of , remarked that its [...] "cheeky love songs disguised as hardcore blasts became the most aped formula in rock." [...] Rock critic Robert Christgau gave it an A- rating, saying [...] "These fishermen don't kid around about what powers hardcore hyperdrive—not simply an unjust society, but also a battered psyche. When they're feeling bad, any kind of power—money, age, ass-man cool, the possession of a vagina—can set off their anarchic, patricidal, 'homo'-baiting, gynephobic rage. But their bad feelings add poignant weight to the doomed vulnerability of the last four songs, which happen to be their hookiest". Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times called the album [...] "Perfect for <b>the</b> <b>little</b> <b>guy</b> who was ever called a nerd and never got the girl. The chainsaw pop combined with earthy humor conveys what is often an inarticulate rage." [...] Hilburn's review was especially affirming for Stevenson, whose father criticized and discouraged his songwriting: [...] "Robert Hillburn was saying something different. He was saying that I can write okay, that I'm a decent songwriter. So it served to shut my dad up a little bit, so that I could pursue the band thing a little less encumbered by his stifling attitude." ...|$|E
