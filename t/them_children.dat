5|$|In {{addition}} to safety advice given in its publications, the RNLI offers safety advice to boat and beach users {{when the opportunity}} arises, and to at-risk groups such as anglers, divers and kayakers. The Institution runs sea and beach safety sessions for young people, particularly in inner-city areas; more than 6,000 children a week are spoken to by education volunteers about sea and beach safety, and over 800 children a week receive training. 500 children were taught to swim in 2014. In {{an effort to reduce}} the estimated 400,000 drownings a year worldwide, more than half of <b>them</b> <b>children,</b> the RNLI extends practical or strategic safety advice to lifesaver organisations overseas, in some cases providing training at the Lifeboat College.|$|E
5|$|When {{high school}} {{students}} followed the lead of their elders and demonstrated, Diệm had them arrested as well. Two of the detained students were paraded {{at a press conference}} in which they falsely admitted to being communists who had brainwashed their entire school, having been tortured to force their confession. At Trung Vuong, an elite girls' high school, the students hung up banners attacking Diệm and the Nhus, while students from the corresponding boys' schools became violent, smashing school windows and erecting banners that insulted Madame Nhu in explicit language. More than 1000 students from Saigon's leading high school, most of <b>them</b> <b>children</b> of public servants and military officers, were sent to re-education camps. The result was that many army officers and senior civil servants had to lobby to have their children or younger siblings released from jail, causing a further drop in morale among government and military officials. In more extreme cases, brawls broke out between police officers arresting students, and the students' parents, many of whom were military officers and/or public servants.|$|E
