5|$|Nestlings, fledglings, and juveniles have brown plumage and pink-brown {{bills with}} shorter tails than adults. Young males develop blue tail {{feathers}} and darker bills by late summer or autumn (following a spring or summer breeding season), while young females develop light blue tails. By the subsequent spring, all males are fertile and have developed cloacal protuberances, which store sperm. In contrast, during the breeding season, fertile females develop oedematous brood patches, which are bare areas on <b>their</b> <b>bellies.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} in the war came when Burnham and Bonar Armstrong, a Company native commissioner, found their way through the Matopos Hills to a sacred cave not many miles from the Mangwe district, to a {{sanctuary}} then known only to the Matabele where Mlimo had been hiding. Not far from the cave was a village (now gone) of about 100 huts filled with many warriors. The two men tethered their horses to a thicket and crawled on <b>their</b> <b>bellies,</b> screening their slow, cautious movements by means of branches held before them. Once inside the cave, they waited until Mlimo entered. Mlimo was said to be about 60 years old, with very dark skin, sharp-featured; American news reports of the time described him as having a cruel, crafty look. Burnham and Armstrong waited until Mlimo entered the cave and started his dance of immunity, at which point Burnham shot Mlimo just below the heart, killing him.|$|E

25|$|A female or male dolphin {{will attempt}} to pursue a mate for about a few minutes. They intertwine facing <b>their</b> <b>bellies</b> {{together}} and begin to copulate for 40 seconds. Once copulation has occurred, the dolphins will break {{away from each other}} and set off in different directions.|$|E
25|$|Sprawling limbs require {{sideways}} flexing during locomotion (except for tortoises and turtles, {{which are}} very slow and whose armor keeps their bodies fairly rigid). However, despite Carrier's constraint, sprawling limbs are efficient for creatures that {{spend most of their}} time resting on <b>their</b> <b>bellies</b> and only move for a few seconds at a timeâ€”because this arrangement minimizes the energy costs of getting up and lying down.|$|E
25|$|Holy {{books have}} also {{mentioned}} milk. The Bible contains {{references to the}} 'Land of Milk and Honey'. In the Qur'an, there is a request to wonder on milk as follows: 'And surely in the livestock there is a lesson for you, We give you to drink of that which is in <b>their</b> <b>bellies</b> from the midst of digested food and blood, pure milk palatable for the drinkers.'(16-The Honeybee, 66). The Ramadan fast is traditionally broken {{with a glass of}} milk and dates.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the Care Bear Stare, the Care Bears can also use <b>their</b> <b>belly</b> symbols to summon other assistance such as heart-shaped balloons, cloud cars, rainbow bridges and sending out a distress signal.|$|R
5000|$|They have {{a yellow}} stripe on each side, {{parallel}} to {{and one or}} two scales below the lateral line. Their back (dorsal area) is light blue to brown and <b>their</b> <b>belly</b> (ventral area) is white to pink.|$|R
25|$|Mesopelagic fish usually lack {{defensive}} spines, and use colour to camouflage {{them from}} other fish. Ambush predators are dark, black or red. Since the longer, red, wavelengths of light do {{not reach the}} deep sea, red effectively functions the same as black. Migratory forms use countershaded silvery colours. On <b>their</b> <b>bellies,</b> they often display photophores producing low grade light. For a predator from below, looking upwards, this bioluminescence camouflages the silhouette of the fish. However, some of these predators have yellow lenses that filter the (red deficient) ambient light, leaving the bioluminescence visible.|$|E
25|$|Pups {{are born}} with a light brown, downy pelage (lanugo), until the first molt at weaning. Younger animals are marked by net-like, {{chocolate}} brown markings and flecks on the shoulders, sides and flanks, shading into the predominantly dark hind and fore flippers and head, often due to scarring from leopard seals. After molting, their fur is a darker brown fading to blonde on <b>their</b> <b>bellies.</b> The fur lightens throughout the year, becoming completely blonde in summer. Older animals become progressively paler, even when freshly molted, and may appear almost white.|$|E
25|$|Young {{saltwater}} crocodiles are {{pale yellow}} in colour with black stripes and spots {{on their bodies}} and tails. This colouration lasts for several years until the crocodiles mature into adults. The colour as an adult is much darker greenish-drab, with a few lighter tan or grey areas sometimes apparent. Several colour variations are known and some adults may retain fairly pale skin, whereas others may be so dark as to appear blackish. The ventral surface is white or yellow in colour on saltwater crocodiles of all ages. Stripes are present on the lower sides of their bodies, but do not extend onto <b>their</b> <b>bellies.</b> Their tails are grey with dark bands.|$|E
25|$|The muscles {{acting on}} the thumb {{can be divided into}} two groups: The {{extrinsic}} hand muscles, with <b>their</b> muscle <b>bellies</b> located in the forearm, and the intrinsic hand muscles, with <b>their</b> muscles <b>bellies</b> located in the hand proper.|$|R
5|$|M. c. leggei, {{described}} by Gregory Mathews in 1912, {{is found in}} eastern South Australia. Males in breeding plumage {{differ from those of}} subspecies cyanochlamys by having blue tinges on <b>their</b> <b>belly</b> below the chest band and on their wing remiges.|$|R
50|$|Bovec sheep may be whitish, or {{in about}} 30% of cases, black or brown. They have small ears, short, thin legs, and <b>their</b> <b>belly</b> is bare. The back legs are {{inclined}} forward {{so that they}} can walk on steep meadows easily.|$|R
25|$|Like other archosaurs, {{crocodilians}} are diapsid, {{although their}} post-temporal fenestrae are reduced. The {{walls of the}} braincase are bony but lack supratemporal and postfrontal bones. Their tongues are not free, but {{held in place by}} a membrane that limits movement; as a result, crocodiles are unable to stick out their tongues. Crocodiles have smooth skin on <b>their</b> <b>bellies</b> and sides, while their dorsal surfaces are armoured with large osteoderms. The armoured skin has scales and is thick and rugged, providing some protection. They are still able to absorb heat through this armour, as a network of small capillaries allows blood through the scales to absorb heat. Crocodilian scales have pores believed to be sensory in function, analogous to the lateral line in fishes. They are particularly seen on their upper and lower jaws. Another possibility is that they are secretory, as they produce an oily substance which appears to flush mud off.|$|E
25|$|Eggs: The name {{given to}} the Derlavaian {{equivalent}} of bombs and shells, eggs are thin metal shells filled with magical energy which burst, or explode, when they impact a target or are triggered by an appropriate spell. A variety of uses for eggs are seen in the series. Armies launch them like shells from magically powered 'egg-tossers', which may be standalone devices or mounted on ley-line ships or behemoths. Dragons can carry eggs beneath <b>their</b> <b>bellies</b> for their fliers to drop on enemy forces or cities. Eggs may also be buried {{in the ground and}} enchanted to explode like landmines if they sense pressure, or can be buried along ley lines and set to explode if a ley line caravan passes over them, which simultaneously destroys the caravan and overloads the ley line's controlling spells. Leviathan riders also use eggs for mining enemy ships. Later in the series, the Algarvian army develops a hand held egg which can be thrown like a hand grenade; these eggs are encased in small pottery sugar bowls rather than metal shells.|$|E
25|$|All Batavian {{activity}} during the main {{phase of the}} battle was therefore on the British right flank, by the Batavian left wing. Here Daendels deployed his forces in three lines, as the front was too narrow to deploy more than two battalions in line at a time. He first had Col. Crass attack with the 1st and 3rd battalions of the 5th Demi-brigade, supported by cavalry and two pieces of horse artillery under Capt. d'Anguerand. He was opposed by the British 3rd Brigade (now under command of Gen. Coote, as Gen. Pulteney had received a wound in the arm and been forced to leave the field). The British had only enough room to deploy one battalion in line {{and there was a}} threat that they would be outflanked near Groote Keeten, where the main action was fought. However, the Batavians were severely hampered by the terrain. The horses sometimes sank to <b>their</b> <b>bellies</b> into the dune sand and the artillery was constantly immobilized by the loose sand. Besides, the British gunboats were able to get very close to the beach and supported the British infantry vigorously, whenever they got sight of the enemy though gaps in the dunes. This British naval gunfire wrought havoc on the Batavian troops.|$|E
5000|$|Martin Martin says of them: They shut {{their doors}} and windows for a dayâ€™s time, and lay in the dark with a stone upon <b>their</b> <b>belly,</b> and <b>their</b> plaids about their heads and eyes, and thus they pumped their brains for rhetorical encomiums.|$|R
50|$|T+Albinos (Tyrosinase {{positive}} albinos), {{also known}} as caramel albinos, are very interesting-looking. Their body colour is a light, buttery yellow to a pale orange.

50|$|This {{species is}} common in estuaries, usually in eelgras beds, but has also been found {{offshore}} to depths of 110 m. Sexual maturity is reached at 12 cm, and breeding occurs from March to November. Males carry the developing embryos in a brood pouch on <b>their</b> <b>belly.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Pontic vases {{are also}} closely related stylistically to Ionian pottery painting. Also {{in this case}} it is assumed that they were {{produced}} in Etruscan workshops by craftsmen who emigrated from Ionia. The vases got their misleading name from the depiction on a vase of archers thought to be Scythians, who lived at the Black Sea (Pontus). Most of the vases were found in graves in Vulci, a significant number also in Cerveteri. The index form was a neck amphora with a particularly slender shape, closely resembling Tyrrhenian amphoras. Other shapes were oenochoes with spiral handles, dinos, kyathos, plates, beakers with high bases, and, less often, kantharos and other forms. The adornment of Pontic vases is always similar. In general there is an ornamental decoration on the neck, then figures on the shoulder, followed by another band of ornaments, an animal frieze, and finally a ring of rays. Foot, neck and handles are black. The importance of ornaments is noticeable, although they are often rather carelessly formed; some vases are decorated only with ornaments. The clay of these vases is yellowish-red; the slip covering the vases is black or brownish-red, of high quality, and with a metallic sheen. Red and white opaque colors are generously used for figures and ornaments. Animals are usually decorated with a white stripe on <b>their</b> <b>bellies.</b> Scholars have identified six workshops to date. The earliest and best is considered to be that of the Paris Painter. He shows mythological figures, included a beardless Heracles, as was customary in eastern Greece. Occasionally there are scenes which are not a part of Greek mythology, such as Heracles fighting Juno Sospita ("the Savior") by the Paris Painter, or a wolf demon by the Tityos Painter. There are also scenes of daily life, komos scenes, and riders. The vases are dated to a time between 550 and 500 BC, and about 200 are known.|$|E
25|$|In Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, wolf {{flesh was}} a main {{ingredient}} in unguents used {{to ward off}} evil. When applied {{in the form of}} a powder, the wolf unguent would be used to cure epilepsy, plague and gout. Powdered wolf bones were used to cure chest and back pains, broken bones and strained tendons. Wolf teeth, particularly the canines, would be perforated and used as talismans against evil spirits. This practice is thought to fall back to the Paleolithic, as shown by some prehistoric grave sites showing numerous wolf tooth charms. It continues in some areas of rural France, where it is also thought that wearing a wolf tooth offers protection from wolf attacks. The tongue, when cooked with flour and honey, was traditionally used as a remedy for epilepsy and as a guarantee of good luck. The eyes of a wolf were traditionally thought to give courage to children and render the user partially invisible. The liver was particularly prized for medicinal and ritualistic purposes. When cooked or desiccated into a powder and mixed with certain ingredients (flour, wine, water, blood, urine etc.), wolf liver was said to cure epilepsy, edema, tachycardia, syphilis, gangrene, vertigo, migraines, verucas and dysentery. Wolf penis supposedly cured impotence. Wolf blood was used for gout, period pains and deafness. The paws and fat of a wolf were sometimes used to ward off evil, or facilitate the transformation of a werewolf. Wolf dung was used against colics. The milk of a she-wolf made the drinker invulnerable, while eating the heart of a wolf gave the consumer courage in battle. A wolf's tail, while used for warding off evil, was also used as a love charm. The head of a wolf, if hung outside a house, would deter wolves, robbers and evil spirits. When reduced to powder, a wolf's head could be used against toothache and joint pains. In the cultures of certain Native American tribes, wolf body parts were considered important additions to certain rituals. Pawnee warriors, known as Wolf People, dressed in wolf skin cloaks when scouting or hunting. Nez Perce warriors wore wolf teeth pushed through the septums of their noses. Cheyenne medicine men wrapped wolf fur on sacred arrows used to motion prey into traps. Arikara men wove wolf fur with bison fur in order to make small sacred blankets. NuxÃ¡lk mothers painted wolf gall bladders on their young male children's backs, so they could grow up to perform religious ceremonies without making mistakes as hunters. Hidatsan women experiencing difficult births would call upon the familial power of wolves by rubbing wolf-skin caps on <b>their</b> <b>bellies.</b> In Mongolian folk medicine, eating the intestines of a wolf is said to alleviate chronic indigestion, while sprinkling food with powdered wolf rectum is said to cure haemorroids. There are not many traditional uses for Ethiopian wolves, though their livers may be used for medicinal reasons in northern Ethiopia.|$|E

50|$|There are sex-dependent {{differences}} in regional fat distribution. In women, estrogen {{is believed to}} cause fat to be stored in the buttocks, thighs, and hips.
