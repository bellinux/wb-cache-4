5|$|Repairs to Vittorio Veneto were {{completed}} in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> join Littorio on {{attacks on the}} convoys Vigorous and Harpoon, which had departed Alexandria and Gibraltar to reinforce Malta simultaneously in mid-June. Combat {{was limited to the}} opposing light forces, and Littorio and Vittorio Veneto did not see action; the British nevertheless broke off Operation Vigorous due to the ships' presence and heavy air attacks. While returning to port, Littorio was hit by a bomb from an American B-24 Liberator heavy bomber; the bomb struck the forward gun turret, though it did minimal damage. Before returning to port, a British Wellington bomber torpedoed the ship. The torpedo struck her starboard bow, though she returned to port. Repairs {{were completed}} and on 12 December, both ships were moved from Taranto to La Spezia in response to the Allied landings in North Africa. Roma joined the fleet shortly after the attacks on the two convoys, and joined her sisters for the move to La Spezia. There, she replaced Littorio as the fleet flagship.|$|E
5|$|In 1830, the Duchess of Kent and Conroy took Victoria {{across the}} centre of England to visit the Malvern Hills, {{stopping}} at towns and great country houses along the way. Similar journeys {{to other parts of}} England and Wales were taken in 1832, 1833, 1834 and 1835. To the King's annoyance, Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops. William compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heir presumptive. Victoria disliked the trips; the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill, and there was little <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> rest. She objected {{on the grounds of the}} King's disapproval, but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy, and forced Victoria to continue the tours. At Ramsgate in October 1835, Victoria contracted a severe fever, which Conroy initially dismissed as a childish pretence. While Victoria was ill, Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary. As a teenager, Victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and Conroy to appoint him to her staff. Once queen, she banned him from her presence, but he remained in her mother's household.|$|E

She departed the United Kingdom for the Mediterranean Sea in June 1943, and in early July 1943 joined Escort Force S at Algiers in Algeria. Escort Force S departed Algiers on 5 July 1943 escorting the military convoy KMS 18 bound for Sicily, but Viceroy had to detach from the convoy on 9 July 1943 for a quick repair at Malta. It was completed in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> depart Malta on 10 July and arrive off the Sicily invasion beaches on 11 July 1943, the day after the initial landings, where she joined Escort Group V to defend the anchorage off the beachhead, conduct patrols, and escort convoys. She continued to support Operation Husky until September 1943, when she returned to the United Kingdom to resume patrol and convoy escort operations in the North Sea. She carried out those duties into 1945, taking no part in operations related to the Allied invasion of Normandy in the summer of 1944.|$|E

When Cora finally meets Zelena, this mother-daughter reunion doesn't go smoothly as planned, and even Zelena is on to what they did with {{the water from the}} River Lethe they put the spell on, as she turns down her mother's false apology.

When Madonna started work on Like a Prayer, she considered many options, {{and thought about the}} musical direction for it. She had certain matters on her mind, including her troubled relationship with her ex-husband Sean Penn, her family, her lost mother and even her belief in God. Madonna thought about lyrical ideas for the songs on topics that, until then, were personal mediation never to be shared with her public so openly and pointedly. She came to the realization that as she and her fans were growing up, and it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> move away from the teen appeal to wider audiences, and en-cash on the longevity of the album market. Madonna wanted her new sound to be calculative and indicative of what was fashionable, and ride the changing trend of music.|$|E
500|$|The backless {{evening gown}} that Sévérine is wearing {{when she first}} meets Bond was created from black satin and {{decorated}} {{with a total of}} 60,000 Swarovski crystals. The crystals were applied to tulle in a tattoo design that was directly inspired by prints from Swarovski's Paris atelier; they appear on the [...] "arms, neckline, back and sides" [...] of the garment. The dress took six months to complete. Temime designed it based on Rita Hayworth's black dress from the 1946 film Gilda. Designer Stephen Webster created the jewelry for the outfit by looking to modern Gothic style for inspiration. Marlohe said that she had an influence on the final design of the dress. It took a long <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> get into it with help from the film's crew; she was sewn into one part of it. Despite this, she said she felt comfortable in it. Six different versions of the body of the dress were created to accommodate the filming schedule; Marlohe changed twice a day during the production, and had to be sewn back into the dress each time.|$|E

In Trust the Man, {{featuring}} Julianne Moore, David Duchovny, and Billy Crudup, she played Elaine, who has been dating Tobey, Crudup's character, for seven years and has begun to {{feel that it is}} <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> settle down and start a family. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. Ethan Alter of Premiere felt that the performances by Gyllenhaal and Duchovny were [...] "much more at ease" [...] and concluded with [...] "that's probably because they're [...] played these characters many times before". In Stranger than Fiction, Gyllenhaal played a love interest of Harold Crick, played by Will Ferrell. Her performance in the film received favorable reviews; Mike Straka of Fox News wrote: [...] "Gyllenhaal has never been sexier in any film before and her interplay with Ferrell will propel her to more A-list films, leaving her indie-darling days behind, no doubt." [...] She voiced Elizabeth [...] "Zee" [...] in the computer animated horror film Monster House. Gyllenhaal played Allison Jimeno, the wife of Port Authority officer Will Jimeno, in Oliver Stone's World Trade Center, based on the September 11 attacks in New York City. She regarded this as [...] "one of the films she most enjoyed making". The film received favorable reviews and proved to be an international success, earning US$162million worldwide.|$|E

But I got it six months ahead of normal. They were like, 'We weren't going to tell you this for a few more months, but we're not going to release you now, so you can't do that job {{you really want to do}} and we're really sorry about that. But on the bright side, we are going to release you proper in the not-so-distant future.' It was good news, bad news — no you can't do this, but don't worry, you're going to have lots more opportunities very soon." [...] Dormer also stated about her departure, [...] "It's the longest time I've ever spent playing a character. I'll always have a little yellow rose after my heart, and I think it was just the right length of time, to be honest.

He added that the release [...] "may not be the nadir of Madonna's career so far, but I can think of few moments that feel as much a {{betrayal}} of her legacy than the way she deadpans 'It's so erotic' right before chirping 'This feeling can't be beat'." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy felt the production credits for MDNA had fueled [...] "over-inflated expectations" [...] for the single. Copsey found it was not [...] "forward-thinking" [...] like Madonna's past records and cited the lyrics [...] "Girls they just wanna have some fun/ Get fired up like a smoking gun" [...] {{as an example of}} this, although he concluded his review writing [...] "we defy anyone who isn't singing this back to themselves immediately after." [...] The New York Observer journalist Daniel D'Addario compared it to [...] "Music", but added that [...] "Madonna was twelve years younger at that time and thus perhaps a more convincing 'bad girl', so too was our culture... maybe it's <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> try something totally different?" [...] In another article for The Guardian, Gareth Grundy proclaimed [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] to be a [...] "clumsy rave-pop", while Amanda Dobbins from New York panned it as a [...] "paint-by-numbers, 808- and Tanqueray-referencing dance track that falls even flatter when compared to its source material". Malone from NME found no innovation in the track, writing, [...] "combined with earlier single 'Give Me All Your Luvin' it points to an uneasy mix for album MDNA." [...] Margaret Wappler from Los Angeles Times felt that Madonna would have been better re-releasing [...] "Music" [...] again as a single, instead of [...] "Girl Gone Wild". She added that [...] "There's something very attractive about a song this militaristic and precise, but in Madge's too-capable hands it's also suffocatingly professional." ...|$|E
