The off-surface flow visualization showed {{that in the case}} of the small single strake deflection, the resulting forebody/strake vortex remained close to the surface and caused accelerated flow and increased suction pressures on the deflected side. When both strakes were deflected differentially, two forebody/strake vortices were present. The forebody/strake vortex from the larger deflection would lift from the surface while the other would remain close to the surface. The nearer forebody/strake vortex would cause greater flow acceleration, higher suction pressures and a yawing moment on that side of the forebody.

40|$|AbstractThe {{intersection}} graph of {{a collection}} C of sets is the graph on the vertex set C, in which C 1,C 2 ∈C are joined by an edge {{if and only if}} C 1 ∩C 2 ≠ 0 ̸. Erdős conjectured that the chromatic number of triangle-free intersection graphs of n segments in the plane is bounded from above by a constant. Here we show that it is bounded by a polylogarithmic function of n, which is the first nontrivial bound for this problem. More generally, we prove that for any t and k, the chromatic number of every Kk-free intersection graph of n curves in the plane, every pair of which have <b>at</b> most <b>t</b> <b>points</b> in common, is at most (ctlognlogk) clogk, where c is an absolute constant and ct only depends on t. We establish analogous results for intersection graphs of convex sets, x-monotone curves, semialgebraic sets of constant description complexity, and sets that can be obtained as the union of a bounded number of sets homeomorphic to a disk. Using a mix of results on partially ordered sets and planar separators, for large k we improve the best known upper bound on the number of edges of a k-quasi-planar topological graph with n vertices, that is, a graph drawn in the plane with curvilinear edges, no k of which are pairwise crossing. As another application, we show that for every ε> 0 and for every positive integer t, there exist δ> 0 and a positive integer n 0 such that every topological graph with n≥n 0 vertices, at least n 1 +ε edges, and no pair of edges intersecting in more than <b>t</b> <b>points,</b> has <b>at</b> least nδ pairwise intersecting edges...|$|R
40|$|CP 1 is a {{yeast protein}} which binds to the highly conserved DNA element I (CDEI) of yeast centromeres. We have {{purified}} CP 1 to near homogeneity; it {{is comprised of}} a single polypeptide of molecular weight 58, 400. When bound to yeast CEN 3 DNA, CP 1 protects a 12 - 15 -base pair region centered over CDEI. Methylation interference experiments show that methylations of residues located outside of the 8 -base pair CDEI sequence have no detectable effect on CP 1 binding, suggesting that the DNA sequences important for CP 1 recognition are confined to the CDEI octanucleotide. The equilibrium constant for CP 1 binding to CEN 3 DNA is relatively low, 3 x 10 (8) M- 1. Using a novel method to determine relative DNA binding constants, we analyzed the effect of CDEI mutations on CP 1 binding. A C to <b>T</b> <b>point</b> mutation <b>at</b> position 5 (CO 1) reduces the equilibrium constant about 35 -fold, while the insertion of an additional T at this position (CAT) reduces the equilibrium constant 1, 400 -fold.

While the CO 1 mutation had a slight effect, the CAT mutation significantly impaired function, implying that CP 1 binding {{is required for the}} optimal mitotic function of yeast centromeres...|$|R

40|$|The 530 stem-loop {{region in}} 16 S rRNA {{is among the}} most phylogenetically conserved {{structural}} elements in all rRNAs, yet its role in protein synthesis remains mysterious. G- 530 is protected from kethoxal attack when tRNA, or its 15 -nucleotide anticodon stem-loop fragment, is bound to the ribosomal A site. Based on presently available evidence, however, this region is believed to be too remote from the decoding site for this protection {{to be the result of}} direct contact. In this study, we use a conditional rRNA expression system to demonstrate that plasmid-encoded 16 S rRNA genes carrying A, C, and <b>T</b> <b>point</b> mutations <b>at</b> position G- 530 confer a dominant lethal phenotype when expressed in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the distribution of plasmid-encoded 16 S rRNA in ribosomal particles, following induction of the A- 530 mutation, shows that mutant rRNA is present both in 30 S subunits and in 70 S ribosomes. Little mutant rRNA is found in polyribosomes, however, indicating that the mutant ribosomes are severely impaired at the stage of polysome formation and/or stability. Detailed chemical probing of mutant ribosomal particles reveals no evidence of structural perturbation within the 16 S rRNA. Taken together, these results argue for the direct participation of G- 530 in ribosomal function and, furthermore, suggest that the dominant lethal phenotype caused by these mutations is due primarily to the mutant ribosomes blocking a crucial step in protein synthesis after translational initiation...|$|R

These issues arise {{due to the lack of}} our responsibility to the world. Researchers agree on that the starting point in changing our society to be green is to increase environmental awareness (Jiang et al., 1999). Several sectors accept this idea like UNESCO which focuses on education as a tool to promote sustainable development (UNESCO, 2002).   Following UNESCO, our study investigates university students’ environmental awareness. The Authors hope that the outcome not only reflects university performance, but also helps to develop the environment in the future.   Hence, the authors selected the University of Gävle or HiG, as a case study because it is a best practice in Environmental Management System (EMS). Moreover, HiG received the ISO 14001 certificate and it has a continuous improvement program (Sammalisto, 2007, p. 69).     The study was started by reviewing research literatures concerning Environmental Management System (EMS), Sustainable Development (SD), Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) and Environmental Awareness. The authors found that there are few studies talking about students’ awareness in universities after being awarded ISO 14001. Notice that the research was seen only from environmental perspective (Flint, 2004).   To answer research questions, two surveys were adopted. The first part focused on teachers and officers (or staffs) who work on environmental issues. While, the second part focused on the students which were divided into Swedish and international.   The research outcomes indicate that HiG has a good EMS performance supported by annual environmental audits, regular policy revision and the attempts to minimize non-conformities. Conversely, when the authors <b>pointed</b> <b>at</b> <b>student</b> awareness, it shows that students have insufficient environmental knowledge. Moreover, some students have lower environmental awareness and act in a less ecological friendly way. Nevertheless, a knowledge problem was also found among several university staffs. This is because of the lack of communication about environmental issues inside the staffs community and lack of environmental education for students.   Whatever the university situation is, there are some groups of staff and students eager to develop themselves and their university. This point of strength could be the best driving force. It can push the university forward until the university reaches sustainable development and it brings the aware graduates into society...|$|R

We used a biparametric approach at high-field MRI (3  T) to assess the structural integrity of the cerebellum in 15 migraineurs with aura (MWA), 23 migraineurs without aura (MWoA), and 20 healthy controls (HC). High-resolution T 1 relaxation maps were acquired together with magnetization transfer images in order to probe microstructural and myelin integrity. Clusterwise analysis was performed on T 1 and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) maps of the cerebellum of MWA, MWoA, and HC using an ANOVA and a non-parametric clusterwise permutation F test, with age and gender as covariates and correction for familywise error rate. In addition, mean MTR and T 1 in frontal regions known to be highly connected to the cerebellum were computed. Clusterwise comparison among groups showed a cluster of lower MTR in the right Crus I of MWoA patients vs. HC and MWA subjects (p[*]=[*] 0. 04).
