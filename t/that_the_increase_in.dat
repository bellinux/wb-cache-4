5|$|As {{a result}} of their warming effects when {{relatively}} thin, cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming. Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase, thereby increasing temperatures and humidity. This, in turn, would increase the cirrus cloud cover, effectively creating a positive feedback circuit. A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose, increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth. In addition, the hypothesis suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud, possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth's infrared radiation to balance out.|$|E
5|$|Following overhaul, Texas resumed duty {{with the}} Atlantic Fleet early in 1919. On 10 March, {{she became the}} first American {{battleship}} to launch an airplane when Lieutenant Commander Edward O. McDonnell flew a British-built Sopwith Camel off the warship. Later in 1919 Texass captain, Nathan C. Twining, successfully employed naval aircraft to spot the fall of shells during a main battery exercise. The results were that aircraft-borne gunfire spotters were significantly more accurate than shipboard spotters. In testimony to the Navy General Board, Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Whiting attested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> gunfire effectiveness with air spotting was likely to be as great as 200%. As a result of these first experiments, the Navy would add floatplanes to all of the fleet's battleships and newer cruisers. In May 1919, Texas served as a plane guard and navigational aid for the successful attempt by Navy Curtiss NC flying boat NC-4 to become the first airplane to cross the Atlantic. On 26 July 1919 Texas entered the Pacific Ocean as part of the newly formed Pacific Fleet and she would spend the next five and half years as a part of Pacific Fleet. On 17 July the following year, she was designated BB-35 under the Navy's newly adopted alpha-numeric system of hull classification symbols.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} examine the {{relationship}} between RNA polymerase I and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), three lines of experiments were performed, with the following results. <b>The</b> glucocorticoid-induced <b>increase</b> of RNA polymerase I in rat liver nuclei was not abolished by administration of inhibitors of ODC synthesis and activity, namely 1, 3 -diaminopropane and 2 -difluoromethylornithine respectively. Anti-ODC antibody did not cross-react with RNA polymerase I solubilized from rat liver nucleoli, indicating the absence of a common protein sequence in these enzymes. The ODC preparation which was treated with transglutaminase in the presence of putrescine could not stimulate the activity of RNA polymerase I in nuclei of liver and prostate. All these results suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> ODC protein or activity are not a prerequisite to <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> RNA polymerase I after hormonal or physiological stimuli, but rather <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> both enzymes are separate responses to the primary stimuli...|$|R

5|$|The National Safety Council, {{a nonprofit}} safety {{advocacy}} group, estimates U.S. motor vehicle deaths in 2016 were 40,200, a 14 {{percent increase from}} its 2014 estimate. The National Safety Council measures roadside deaths differently than U.S. government agencies.

The National Safety Council's statistics show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> 2016 was due only in part to increased miles driven (due to population growth, low gasoline prices, and a strengthening economy.) The National Safety Council suggests the increase in deaths not explained by increased vehicle miles is attributable to complacency about impaired driving and increased driver distraction.|$|E

40|$|This paper proves <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{use of the}} Cobb-Douglas form of {{production}} function is suitable for modelling the technological efficiency of selected production factors used in cattle breeding. Furthermore, {{it is possible to}} use the estimated function to analyse economic efficiency, considering also the prices of the production factors. The results of the econometric estimation show that higher initial weight affects negatively the dynamics of weight gain. Analysing the efficiency of the two main feedstuff components, i. e. the haylage and hay, it was found out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> weight react inelastically with respect to the volume of feedstuffs, which is in line with the physiological limits of the animal production. The results further reveal <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> weight react more sensitively to haylage compared to hay. Thus, it is possible to conclude, that haylage provides technologically more efficient way of cattle breeding in comparison to hay.

25|$|Although it {{is unclear}} when the AMY1 gene copy number began to increase, it is known and {{confirmed}} that the AMY1 gene existed in early primates. Chimpanzees, the closest evolutionary relatives to humans, {{were found to have}} 2 diploid copies of the AMY1 gene that is identical in length to the human AMY1 gene, which is significantly less than that of humans. On the other hand, bonobos, also a close relative of modern humans, was found to have more than 2 diploid copies of the AMY1 gene. Nonetheless, the bonobo AMY1 genes were sequenced and analyzed, and {{it was found that the}} coding sequences of the AMY1 genes were disrupting, which may lead to the production of dysfunctional salivary amylase. It can be inferred from the results <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> bonobo AMY1 copy number is likely not correlated to the amount of starch in their diet. It was further hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> copy number began recently during early hominin evolution as none of the great apes had more than two copies of the AMY1 gene that produced functional protein. In addition, it was speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the AMY1 copy number began around 20,000 years ago when humans shifted from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agricultural societies, which was also when humans relied heavily on root vegetables high in starch. This hypothesis, although logical, lacks experimental evidence due to the difficulties in gathering information on the shift of human diets, especially on root vegetables that are high in starch as they cannot be directly observed or tested. Recent breakthroughs in DNA sequencing has allowed researchers to sequence older DNA such as that of Neanderthals to a certain degree of accuracy. Perhaps sequencing Neanderthal DNA can provide a time marker as to when the AMY1 gene copy number increased and offer insight into human diet and gene evolution.|$|E
