5|$|The common {{blackbird}} {{is one of}} {{a number}} of species which has unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. One hemisphere of the brain is effectively asleep, while a low-voltage EEG, characteristic of wakefulness, is present in the other. The benefit of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bird can rest in areas of high predation or during long migratory flights, but still retain a degree of alertness.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{pressure}} difference across a fluid interface {{is proportional to}} the mean curvature, as seen in the Youngâ€“Laplace equation. For an open soap film, the pressure difference is zero, hence the mean curvature is zero, and minimal surfaces have the property of zero mean curvature.|$|E

Then Route 37 will continue northward to Millwood Pike (US 50/ US 17) and have another diamond interchange. The next exit will be at Senseny Road (State Route 657) with another diamond interchange. The next and final exit will be a half cloverleaf interchange with VA 7, {{but it is not}} final {{that it will be a}} half cloverleaf because of Valley Mill Road (State Route 659). The problem with <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> intersection with Valley Mill Road is where the southbound exit for Route 37 is to come into Route 7.|$|E

5|$|In the 2nd centuryBC, the Iazyges {{began to}} migrate {{west to the}} steppe near the Lower Dniester. One {{possible}} explanation of <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Roxolani, who <b>were</b> the Iazyges' eastern neighbors, were also migrating west, due to pressure from the Aorsi, which {{put pressure on the}} Iazyges and forced them to migrate west as well.|$|R
5|$|Most {{observed}} white dwarfs {{have relatively}} high surface temperatures, between 8,000K and 40,000K. A white dwarf, though, spends {{more of its}} lifetime at cooler temperatures than at hotter temperatures, so we should expect {{that there are more}} cool white dwarfs than hot white dwarfs. Once we adjust for the selection effect that hotter, more luminous white dwarfs are easier to observe, we do find that decreasing the temperature range examined results in finding more white dwarfs. This trend stops when we reach extremely cool white dwarfs; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4,000K, and one of the coolest so far observed, WD 0346+246, has a surface temperature of approximately 3,900K. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Universe's age is finite; there has not been enough time for white dwarfs to cool below this temperature. The white dwarf luminosity function can therefore be used to find the time when stars started to form in a region; an estimate for the age of our Galactic disk found in this way is 8 billion years. A white dwarf will eventually, in many trillions of years, cool and become a non-radiating black dwarf in approximate thermal equilibrium with its surroundings and with the cosmic background radiation. No black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.|$|E
5|$|Most {{octopuses}} swim by expelling a jet {{of water}} from the mantle through the siphon into the sea. The physical principle behind <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> force required to accelerate the water through the orifice produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction. The direction of travel depends on the orientation of the siphon. When swimming, the head is at the front and the siphon is pointed backwards, but when jetting, the visceral hump leads, the siphon points towards the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a fusiform appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species flatten themselves dorso-ventrally, and swim with the arms held out sideways, and this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. Jetting is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the heart from beating, resulting in a progressive oxygen deficit.|$|E
5|$|Overfishing is {{a serious}} threat to {{seamount}} ecological welfare. There are several well-documented cases of fishery exploitation, for example the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) off the coasts of Australia and New Zealand and the pelagic armorhead (Pseudopentaceros richardsoni) near Japan and Russia. The reason for <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fishes that are targeted over seamounts are typically long-lived, slow-growing, and slow-maturing. The problem is confounded by the dangers of trawling, which damages seamount surface communities, and the fact that many seamounts are located in international waters, making proper monitoring difficult. Bottom trawling in particular is extremely devastating to seamount ecology, and is responsible for as much as 95% of ecological damage to seamounts.|$|E
2500|$|According to [...] Nicklas Lundblad, another {{perspective}} on privacy protection <b>is</b> <b>the</b> assumption <b>that</b> <b>the</b> quickly growing {{amount of information}} produced will be beneficial. <b>The</b> reasons for <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> costs for the surveillance will raise and <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> more noise, noise being understood as anything <b>that</b> interferes <b>the</b> process of a receiver trying to extract private data from a sender.|$|R
30|$|The Gaussian input, {{interference}} {{and noise}} assumptions are fairly {{standard in the}} signal processing for communications literature [3, 27, 28].

5|$|Since the {{practical}} function of striping {{has not been}} determined for zebras in general, it is unclear why the quagga lacked stripes on its hind parts. A cryptic function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and biting flies (which are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided species recognition during stampedes of mixed herds, so that members of one subspecies or species would follow its own kind. It has also been evidence that the zebras developed striping patterns as thermoregulation to cool themselves down, and that the quagga lost them due to living in a cooler climate, although one problem with <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mountain zebra lives in similar environments and has a bold striping pattern. A 2014 study strongly supported the biting-fly hypothesis, and the quagga appears to have lived in areas with lesser amounts of fly activity compared to other zebras.|$|E
