25|$|A {{hearing aid}} or deaf aid is an electroacoustic device which is {{designed}} to amplify sound for the wearer, usually with the aim of making speech more intelligible, and to correct impaired hearing as measured by audiometry. This type of assistive technology helps people with hearing loss participate more fully in their communities by allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> more clearly. They amplify any and all sound waves through use of a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. There is a wide variety of hearing aids available, including digital, in-the-ear, in-the-canal, behind-the-ear, and on-the-body aids.|$|E

25|$|Within most scenes, {{the player}} {{can control the}} main {{character}} by moving them around the environment; they can also hold down a button to see what thoughts are going through the character's mind, and trigger <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> an internal monologue on that thought. When the player is near an object or another character they can interact with, they will be presented with a context sensitive icon that represents what control they need to do. These controls include pressing {{a button on the}} DualShock controller, moving the analogue sticks in a specific manner, or rotating the motion-sensitive controller in a specific way; in the version with PlayStation Move support, further actions based on the Move controllers are also present. These actions may lead to additional actions to fully complete the interaction. Some scenes impose a timer on the player, requiring them to complete the necessary actions in time to avoid the death or incapacitation of that character. In other scenes, the player does not have full control of the character but must instead be prepared to respond to these icons in the manner of quick time events, such as during a hand-to-hand fight or while driving frantically {{on the wrong side of}} the road.|$|E

Sometimes Ali would stroll into the audience during his nut swallowing trick. His stomach exposed by his standard costume, he invited audience members to pat his stomach, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the nuts rattling within. One newspaper reported that Ali's feats, essentially controlled vomiting, were performed in [...] "a manner without the least bit of unpleasantness or anything bordering on repulsiveness." [...] Not everyone felt the same: {{at least one of}} Ali's engagements was cut short once the proprietor realized that the nature of the act [...] "was killing their supper shows".

[...] In June that year, two days after {{finishing}} the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: [...] "Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger". The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The polite and restrained Japanese audiences shocked the band, because the absence of screaming fans allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> how poor their live performances had become. By the time that they arrived in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting the First Lady Imelda Marcos, the group had grown unhappy with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary.|$|E

[...] The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided he Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: [...] "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." [...] He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him [...] "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." [...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to tell you all about the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth.

2500|$|Voluntary {{opening of}} the eustachian tubes: Voluntary {{opening of the}} tubes: Voluntary Tubal Opening:(French: béance tubaire volontaire (BTV) [...] ) is a method of {{equalising}} or clearing the ears described by doctor Georges Delonca and used in scuba diving and freediving. It aims to rebalance the pressure between the external ear and middle ear.The subject must either exercise a voluntary control of the tensor veli palatini muscles opening the eustachian tubes, or move the jaw to open the tubes when necessary. Another description of the method is to tense {{the muscles of the}} soft palate and the throat while pushing the jaw forward and down as if starting to yawn. This should pull the eustachian tubes open.This is less easy to execute than the Valsalva maneuver, but the BTV is the gentlest method to clear the ears. However, not all divers can perform this maneuver. It may be necessary to engage in ear training exercises to train the muscles to perform this maneuver.*: Some people are able to voluntarily hold their Eustachian tubes open continuously for a period of several seconds to minutes. The 'clicking your ears' can actually be heard if one puts one's ear to another person's ear for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the clicking sound. Those that are borderline on learning this voluntary control first discover this via yawning or swallowing or other means; which after practice can be done deliberately without force even when there are no pressure issues involved. When the Eustachian Tubes are deliberately held open, one's voice sounds louder in one's head than when they are closed.|$|E
