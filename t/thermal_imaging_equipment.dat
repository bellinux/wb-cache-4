25|$|The M2 Bradley turret {{provides}} the EIFV with considerable firepower on a cheap M113 chassis, and {{allows it to}} engage personnel, armored vehicles and tanks, as well as low flying targets and helicopters. It has the same fire control and stabilization features on the M2 Bradley. The armament consists of the 25mm M242 chain gun with 800 rounds and an effective range of 3000 m, and a coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun with 2,100 rounds. Using armor-piercing rounds, the chain gun can engage armored vehicles and tanks. The turret also has a two-tube TOW launcher, capable of launching TOW II ATGM missiles, which can destroy most tanks at a maximum range of 3750 m, enabling the vehicle {{to be used in}} an anti tank role. The only major drawback is that the missiles can only be launched when the vehicle is stationary.

50|$|An {{image sensor}} or imaging sensor is a sensor that detects and conveys the {{information}} that constitutes an image. It does so by converting the variable attenuation of light waves (as they pass through or reflect off objects) into signals, small bursts of current that convey the information. The waves can be light or other electromagnetic radiation. Image sensors are used in electronic imaging devices of both analog and digital types, which include digital cameras, camera modules, medical <b>imaging</b> <b>equipment,</b> night vision <b>equipment</b> such as <b>thermal</b> <b>imaging</b> devices, radar, sonar, and others. As technology changes, digital imaging tends to replace analog imaging.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Body {{temperature}} monitoring {{is one of}} the oldest and still one of the most basic diagnostic methods in medicine. In recent years <b>thermal</b> <b>imaging</b> has been increasingly used in measurements of body temperature for diagnostic purposes. <b>Thermal</b> <b>imaging</b> is non-invasive, non-contact method for measuring surface body temperature. Method is quick, painless and patient is not exposed to ionizing radiation or any other body burden. Application of <b>thermal</b> <b>imaging</b> in medicine: Pathological conditions can be indicated as hyper- or hypothermic patterns in many cases. <b>Thermal</b> <b>imaging</b> is presented as a diagnostic method, which can detect such thermal anomalies. This article provides an overview of the <b>thermal</b> <b>imaging</b> applications in various fields of medicine. <b>Thermal</b> <b>imaging</b> has proven to be a suitable method for human febrile temperature screening, for the detection of sites of fractures and infections, a reliable diagnostic tool in the detection of breast cancer and determining the type of skin cancer tumour. It is useful in monitoring the course of a therapy after spinal cord injury, in the detection of food allergies and detecting complications at hemodialysis and is also very effective at the course of treatment of breast reconstruction after mastectomy. With <b>thermal</b> <b>imaging</b> is possible to determine the degrees of burns and early detection of osteomyelitis in diabetic foot phenomenon. The most common and the oldest application of <b>thermal</b> <b>imaging</b> in medicine is the field of rheumatology. Recommendations for use and standards: Essential performance of a <b>thermal</b> <b>imaging</b> camera, measurement method, preparation of a patient and environmental conditions are very important for proper interpretation of measurement results in medical applications of <b>thermal</b> <b>imaging.</b> Standard for screening thermographs was formed for the human febrile temperature screening application. Conclusion: Based on presented examples it is shown that <b>thermal</b> <b>imaging</b> can be widely used also in the field of medicine. Implementation of every new technology in a daily clinical practice requires large number of measurements with such equipment compared by reference method for the purpose of clinical validation. The knowledge of measurement problematics is crucial. Collaboration between physicians and engineers on multi- and interdisciplinary level is of high importance for <b>thermal</b> <b>imaging</b> to win confidence of physicians and to gain reliability as a clinical diagnostic tool. </p...|$|R
