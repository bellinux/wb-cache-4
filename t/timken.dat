5|$|VAT used Valmet gearboxes, {{which were}} copied from the {{transmissions}} {{made by the}} American company Fuller in the late 1940s and the early 1950s. When components became more easily available, VAT started to use genuine Fullers and ZF-made gearboxes. The transfer cases were supplied by <b>Timken</b> and ZF. VAT built the rear axles from gears made by ATA until the company started buying axles from <b>Timken.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2014, O'Donnell and <b>Timken</b> began {{talks with}} the Coast Guard Museum Association about selling the station to a {{third-party}} investor associated with the Association. The sale was originally to be effective {{at the end of}} 2014, but was delayed because the Redevelopment Agency never issued a formal certificate of completion for the 1975 sale and renovations. Since the Agency was dissolved in 2008, the City Council issued the certificate in early January 2015, allowing the sale the proceed. On January 12, the Council released the station from the 1960s urban renewal plan as part of an agreement with O'Donnell and <b>Timken</b> to ease the sale process. The new agreement also included stipulations for historic preservation of the building, and allowed – but not required – its continued use as a train station. On January 29, 2015, Union Station Development sold the station to the New London RR Company – a holding company owned by James Coleman Jr., chairman of the Association – for $3 million. Coleman brought in a restaurant serving locally sourced food for the first floor, and intends to renovate the second floor for use by museum-related tenants.|$|E
5|$|The third design, by George Ivatt, {{initially}} was Type 'C1' {{and it was}} paired with the three locomotives Nos. 6253–6255. It was partially riveted and resembled a Type 'A' at its front end and a Type 'B' at the rear. The design was quickly followed by Type 'C2', which differed from the 'C1' in {{that it had a}} lower front edge and was fitted with <b>Timken</b> roller bearings. Only two 'C2's were built and they were coupled to the last two of the class, Nos. 6256 and 6257.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{many of the}} 1970s repairs were {{beginning}} to wear down, and the city put aside its plans for the maritime museum. The New London Railroad Company, fronted by historian Barbara <b>Timken</b> and local businessman Todd O'Donnell, bought the station from the city as the New London Railroad Company in 2002. The pair organized a second full restoration of the station, including a new slate roof, restored brickwork, and restoration of the waiting room to its original configuration. The mezzanine level and basement atrium created in the 1976 renovation were removed. Additionally, mechanical systems were upgraded and various accessibility concerns addressed. The baggage room was restored for Greyhound use. Amtrak and Greyhound rent space from the company for offices and passenger waiting areas.|$|E

2500|$|As {{artillery}} {{pieces were}} being towed more often by tracked vehicles, prime mover chassis became available for other uses.

[...] "It survived not so much because of the winter proof feature as because of its quality." [...] Founder Herbert Franklin prized his reputation for fine materials and scrupulous workmanship.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Timken</b> chose a 4-8-4 {{on which}} to {{demonstrate}} the company's bearings so the locomotive {{could be used in}} all types of railroad work, especially on heavy freight and fast passenger trains. [...] A total of 52 different parts manufacturers agreed to supply their parts for the locomotive [...] "on account" [...] until the locomotive operated over 100,000miles (161,000km). [...] The suppliers' names were placed on a plaque that was fastened to the tender {{for the duration of the}} demonstration period.|$|E
2500|$|The Northern Pacific {{purchased}} the 1111 from <b>Timken</b> on February 8, 1933, after it crossed the [...] mark. [...] The railroad renumbered it to 2626, classifying it internally as locomotive class A-1 (this locomotive was the class's sole member), {{and used it}} in passenger service between Seattle and Yakima, Washington, and later shifted its service to passenger trains between Seattle and Missoula, Montana. [...] Northern Pacific used the locomotive for 23 years before retiring it from active service. [...] The locomotive's last run was made on August 4, 1957 when it pulled a passenger train from Seattle to Cle Elum and return.|$|E
2500|$|By August 1931, the {{locomotive}} {{had been used}} for over 90,000miles (145,000km) when it was delivered to the Northern Pacific Railroad, the fifteenth railroad to demonstrate {{the locomotive}}. [...] With a dynamometer car in tow, the Northern Pacific was able to drive the locomotive {{as fast as a}} sustained 88mph (142km/h) while pulling the North Coast Limited passenger train past Willow Creek, Montana. However, while in service for the Northern Pacific 1111 suffered severe crown sheet damage. <b>Timken</b> demanded that Northern Pacific repair it, while Northern Pacific refused to repair a locomotive they did not own.

York and Broom were members of a Northampton-based band called The Apex Group, fronted by bass player and band leader Frank Short. Hunter soon left his home in Shrewsbury, transferred his apprenticeship from Sentinel/Rolls Royce to British <b>Timken</b> in Northampton, and joined The Apex Group on rhythm guitar. Hunter recalls jumping around like a lunatic on stage: [...] "Music affected me so much. The rest of them just stood there. It was funny, I had kids who came just to watch me do this, and I can't imagine what it looked like." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1959, {{the city}} hired an {{architectural}} firm {{to map out}} {{a plan for the}} park based on the suggestions of San Diegans along with the firm's recommendations. The initial review called for 13 of the original 1915 buildings to remain while replacing 11 others with new buildings in their place. The plan also called for adjusted roadways, additional landscaping, and improvements in parking. By 1967, the city and private charities such as the Committee of 100 undertook a major effort to restore the park's historic buildings. Most of the original Exposition buildings were continuing to deteriorate with some lacking foundations and minimal structural support. By the 1990s some of the Prado buildings were deteriorating so badly that [...] "pieces of plaster regularly fell off the walls." [...] Several crumbling buildings were torn down and replaced with permanent structures which were carefully detailed to maintain the original appearance. The Science and Education Building and the Home Economy Building were demolished {{to make room for the}} expansion of two new wings for the <b>Timken</b> Museum of Art. The loss of these two buildings along with the Casa de Balboa, the House of Charm, and the House of Hospitality, resulted in the formation of the independent organization, Committee of One Hundred, to attempt to preserve the exhibition buildings.|$|E
