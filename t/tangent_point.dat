25|$|Ocean City was a {{combination}} of both Tower-shaped City and Marine City. It consisted of two rings that were tangent to one another, with housing on the inner ring and production on the outer one. Administrative buildings were found at the <b>tangent</b> <b>point.</b> The population would have been rigidly controlled at an upper limit of 500,000. Kikutake envisaged that the city would expand by multiplying itself as though it was undergoing cell division.

The method produces an approximation cubic B-spline curve tangent {{to a given}} curve at a set of selected positions, called <b>tangent</b> <b>points,</b> in a piecewise manner starting from a seed segment. A heuristic method is provided to select the <b>tangent</b> <b>points.</b> The first segment of the approximation cubic B-spline curve can be obtained using an inner point interpolation method, least-squares method or geometric Hermite method as a seed segment. The approximation curve is further extended to other <b>tangent</b> <b>points</b> one by one by curve unclamping. New <b>tangent</b> <b>points</b> can also be added, if necessary, by using {{the concept of the}} minimum shape deformation angle of an inner point for better approximation. Numerical examples show that the new method is effective in approximating a given curve and is efficient in computation...|$|R

These lines are parallel to the desired tangent lines, because the situation corresponds to shrinking both circles C1 and C2 by a constant amount, r2, which shrinks C2 to a point. Two radial lines may {{be drawn from the}} center O1 through the <b>tangent</b> <b>points</b> on C3; these intersect C1 at the desired <b>tangent</b> <b>points.</b> The desired external tangent lines are the lines perpendicular to these radial lines at those <b>tangent</b> <b>points,</b> which may be constructed as described above.|$|R
500|$|The {{property}} of tangency {{is defined as}} follows. First, a point, line or circle {{is assumed to be}} tangent to itself; hence, if a given circle is already tangent to the other two given objects, it is counted as a solution to Apollonius' problem. Two distinct geometrical objects are said to intersect if they have a point in common. By definition, a point is tangent to a circle or a line if it intersects them, that is, if it lies on them; thus, two distinct points cannot be tangent. If the angle between lines or circles at an intersection point is zero, they are said to be tangent; the intersection point is called a <b>tangent</b> <b>point</b> or a point of tangency. (The word [...] "tangent" [...] derives from the Latin present participle, tangens, meaning [...] "touching".) In practice, two distinct circles are tangent if they intersect at only one point; if they intersect at zero or two points, they are not tangent. The same holds true for a line and a circle. Two distinct lines cannot be tangent in the plane, although two parallel lines can be considered as tangent at a point at infinity in inversive geometry (see below).|$|E

2500|$|Radio {{occultation}} is {{a remote}} sensing technique where a GNSS signal tangentially scrapes the Earth, passing through the atmosphere, and is received by a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite. As the signal passes through the atmosphere, it is refracted, curved and delayed.
