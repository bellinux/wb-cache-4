5|$|Some dinosaurs {{are known}} to have used gizzard stones like modern birds. These stones are {{swallowed}} by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibers once <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> stomach. When found in association with fossils, gizzard stones are called gastroliths.|$|E

The {{first is the}} leopard seal (Hydrurga leptonyx), which takes some adult birds, as well as fledglings soon after <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> water. Orcas (Orcinus orca), mostly take adult birds, although they will attack penguins of any age in or near water.|$|E

5|$|Candidates {{may have}} {{previous}} college experience, {{but they may}} not transfer, meaning that regardless of previous college credit, <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> academy as a fourth class cadet and undergo the entire four-year program. If a candidate is considered academically disqualified and not selected, he or she may receive an offer to attend to the United States Military Academy Preparatory School. Upon graduation from USMAPS, these candidates are appointed to the academy if they receive the recommendation of the USMAPS Commandant and meet medical admission requirements.|$|E

Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) suspect that one of Dr. Kroger's patients was responsible. Dr. Kroger says it can be Joseph Wheeler (Kevin Fry), who threatened him in the past. Dr. Kroger blames himself for not predicting the murder, and decides to retire. Wheeler, however, is dismissed as a suspect as he has a confirmed alibi.|$|E
5|$|Globular {{clusters}} normally {{consist of}} Population II stars, {{which have a}} low proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium when compared to Population I stars such as the Sun. Astronomers refer to these heavier elements as metals and to the proportions of these elements as the metallicity. These elements are produced by stellar nucleosynthesis and then are recycled into the interstellar medium, where <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> next generation of stars. Hence the proportion of metals can be {{an indication of the}} age of a star, with older stars typically having a lower metallicity.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to safety design, new security measures will be implemented. All vehicles will be screened for radioactive materials and other potentially dangerous objects before <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> site through the underground road. Four hundred closed-circuit surveillance cameras {{will be placed}} {{in and around the}} site, with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the NYPD. A computer system will use video-analytic computer software, designed to detect potential threats, such as unattended bags, and retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects. New York City and Port Authority police will patrol the site.|$|E

5|$|In {{neutrino}} astronomy, astronomers use heavily shielded {{underground facilities}} such as SAGE, GALLEX, and Kamioka II/III {{for the detection}} of neutrinos. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the Sun, but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova 1987A. Cosmic rays, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories. Some future neutrino detectors may also be sensitive to the particles produced when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Some medieval rabbis {{claimed that}} today's Western Wall is a {{surviving}} {{wall of the}} Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest <b>they</b> <b>enter</b> <b>the</b> Temple precincts {{in a state of}} impurity. Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness. Most secular scholars believe however that these traditions originally pertained to a western wall of the Temple itself, and since the 1500s, were gradually applied to the surviving retaining Western Wall of the Mount.|$|E
