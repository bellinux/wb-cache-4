The package was received this week in good condition + I was certainly pleased with it. We are, at present, in the second week of our basic course, second term, after returning from a 7 day furlough which ware given every 12 weeks to those who are fortunate to continue in the program. This program is one which keeps us on the move from 06 : 30 to 2300 every day except for weekends. We now have to learn and learn fast of we will be too far behind to keep up with the studies. Life has a little too much military life so we can only say we are the army getting an education- not college students. Everyday is routine; very little excitement. Best Regards to all“Bill” Bliven.

SCU # 1112 Fort Devens, Mass Service Club Number OneFort Devens, Massachusetts 14 April 44 Dear Bryant Service Club- I had <b>thought</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> had {{forgotten}} {{some of the}} boys in the Service because of changes in address and was glad to hear from the organization which was started while I was still in attendance at Bryant. I was moved from Harvard Univ, when the Army’s College training program was halted + have been in Devens since the 8 th of March awaiting my new assignment which is only two week[s] away. I was wondering if you have a mimeographed list of the boys in the service and their current addresses. I would like the address of the fellows in the class of ’ 43 A + F who are still in the service. Phil Cornell, AAF, class of ’ 43 if we had been able to finish is on his way overseas if not at his overseas base already. I keep in touch with quite a few of the old gang as often as possible. I {{want to thank you for}} your lovely Easter package which I received today. I’m sure all the fellows appreciate the packages. Have some work to do so I’ll have to cut this a little short- so till next time. Yours in the serviceBill Bliven [Transcription ends...|$|E

"If {{the time}} should come, Harry, when the fortune of war may compel the king {{to retire from}} Oxford--which I trust may never be--I would then grant your request, for after your {{encounter}} with the officer who commanded the Roundheads here, {{it would not be}} safe for you to remain behind. But although you are too young {{to take part in the}} war, I may find you employment. After a council that was held yesterday at Oxford, I learned, from one in the king's secrets, that it was designed to send a messenger to London with papers of importance, and to keep up the communication with the king's friends in that city. There was some debate as to who should be chosen. In London, at the present time, all strangers are closely scrutinized. Every man is suspicious of his neighbor, and it is difficult to find one of sufficient trust whose person is unknown. Then I have <b>thought</b> that <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> could well fulfill this important mission. A boy would be unsuspected, where a man's every movement would be watched. There is, of course, some danger attending the mission, and sharpness and readiness will be needed. You have shown that you possess these, by the manner in which you made your escape from London, and methinks that, did you offer, your services would be accepted. You would have, of course, to go in disguise, and to accept any situation which might appear conformable to your character and add to your safety." ...|$|R

40|$|Translation begins] Sunday My Darling- Can’t {{remember}} {{whether or}} not I wrote to you Friday night- If I did, don’t know where the letter is. Anyway it probably wasn’t anything interesting- Couldn’t have been very long because Woody and I went to the movies. Saw “Can’t Help Singing” and “The Jade Mask”. Oh, you sounded so far away today when you called. Golly, this morning seems so long ago. It seems {{at least a day}} away. It seems hours. This has been the longest day. Gee, honey, it was wonderful to hear your voice again. I love you so much, darling. Just a month from today and we’ll be married. Gee. Oh, honey, I’m glad that you’re going to get the wedding rings. How much is yours going to be? What kind are you getting- be sure that mine will go with my engagement ring, honey. I’ll either send you the money or give it to you when I come down- whichever is best for you- so let me know. Golly, honey, you’re so organized and you’ve got everything so organized and all arranged and everything. You’re just wonderful. I’ve got millions of things to do but just can’t seem to get started. Well, I did the most important thing anyhow- Bought my wedding dress. Hope that you’ll like it, darling. It’s more or less ivory satin but not the kind of ivory that looks dirty. Wish I could draw then I could give you an idea. Oh, well- it will be better if you’re completely surprised. I hope pleasantly. I think the dress is beautiful- of course I’m probably prejudiced. It has a train- not too long. Charlotte’s definitely coming down. Don’t get two double rooms if you can possibly advoid [sic] it, darling because we can have more fun all together. If they can’t bring in an extra bed, three of us can sleep together. Oh, honey, is the graduation dance going to be on Friday? Can you get Charlotte a date? I hope that all the fellows don’t have their girls down. Do you think that you can? Let’s see. What else was there to talk about. Honestly, honey, my mind is a complete blank I just can’t concentrate on anything. Must be love- I’ve been trying to get Mom all day. Maybe she’s in Brooklyn or something. Wanted to tell her that you called. Gee, honey, when you called I was completely surprised. Couldn’t remember a darned thing that I wanted to ask you and still can’t. Besides that my voice is or was going away. It was very helpful for a good intelligent conversation- since I’ll half asleep now this will be a great letter. Oh, I was looking for a sweater today and came across some pictures that we took a year ago thanksgiving. A girl I used to work with is the one with mother and I. She was from Cleveland and wall all alone so I invited her up for dinner. They’re horrible pictures but what can you expect with me in front of the camera. That was when I used to eat bullets- my hair shot out in bangs. Honey, do you ¾ length coats? I’m trying to decide whether I do. Saw a cute one last Saturday and maybe I’ll get it next weekend. Oh, honey, guess what. Mother gave me a can opener. Now we can eat! It’s the kind that I can use, too! Well, at least we won’t starve now- I hope. Oh, golly, my darling, I miss you so much. Every day I miss you more and more. Well, honey, things don’t look too good for around the 10 th or 11 th. Honestly, everything happens to us- I’m almost positive but until the 10 th or maybe the 11 th can’t be sure. I told you on the phone that I got my dress. Oh, I guess I wrote you that in the letter, too. See what I mean- I’m really in a hopeless condition. It really was an accident about my buying the dress. Charlotte and I were looking for a dress for her to wear to the wedding and I happened to see this store where they advertised bridal dresses all the time. We went in just to look and their dresses were all right. Nothing to rave about but they were nice. They didn’t fit me too well. Then she brought out a dress that they used as a window sample. That’s smaller than a size 10 + fitted perfectly. So now I’m all happy and all I have to do is pay for it and leave an arm and leg and the dress will be mine. Oh honey, how hot will it be down there in March? Golly, that dress {{is probably going to be}} so hot. It’s all satin- Golly, I’ll probably die of the heat. What else did I want to ask you? Something happened to this pen and its scratching and writing funny. Fine thing. Gee, honey, what a wreck I am. There are a million and one things to be done yet but something always happens. You’re really wonderful to be getting everything done so quickly. Guess I’m not the efficient type. Gee, honey I hope these next few weeks go fast. I love you so and it’s been so long since we were together. That Flight Officer Exam sounds quite odd to say the least. How they can grade anything like that is really amazing. Wonder what the right answers were supposed to be. By the way, did you find the purple flag yet? What kind of morons are Flight Officers anyway. That must have been some test. When do you find out? Do they give you an exam for Lieutenant, too? Hope that’s on a higher plane- Isn’t it strange that I’ve always called you Judson- Don’t know why. Alway did like your name though. Now I call you Judd almost all the time when I talk about you which is always. Well, if the paper said it was all right to get married when you can’t cook, guess it’s all right. But, honey, will they send someone from the paper down to cook for you when you’re hungry? It would be such a waste of time to get married at home. Everything is really much more complicated this way. If you only knew how much more. Of course we really haven’t any argument because it’s costing more to come down than any wedding and reception ever would and besides- oh, heck, I’m not on that side- I like this way better. Gee, honey, do you think that we’ll have enough money for me to ride all day? When you’re flying I’d like to ride. As often + as much as possible- we can worry about that later, though. Gee, honey, I wish I were flying so that the time would pass quickly. It just drags so slowly. I’m so glad that you have 40 hours in. You’ll have to be doing a lot of flying from now on to get those last thirty hours in. You flew this afternoon, too. Have you started instruments and night flying, honey? Tomorrow I probably won’t write because Daddy and I are going to see “Winged Victory” I hope. How did you like shooting skeet? Was it fun- I’d love to learn how to shoot. Maybe I can find a cowboy in Texas- on second <b>thought,</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>you</b> could teach me. How’s my little grounded goose tonight? I can just see you feeling like one when you don’t fly. Every day that we’re apart just seems wasted. I hope March hurries. Darling, I’ll never be able to tell you how much I love you. There are so many different ways but I guess the only one I ever can think of is I love you and that’s not very expressive. Gee, honey, I’m so glad that you sent me those pictures. I just sit and look at them for hours. That’s one reason it takes me so long to write a letter to you. They’re wonderful just like you. I love you so, my darling- wish I could tell you how much. Heard “If You Are But a Dream” today- I miss you so whenever I hear any of the song that we heard together. Oh, saw “Together, Again” Morra was very good. Well, hun, it’s late again. I love you so. Hope we won’t be apart much longer. I love you and miss you more every day. You’ll have all my love. Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|E
