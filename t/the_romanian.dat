50|$|His six-volume Istoria românilor din Dacia-Traiană ("The History of <b>the</b> <b>Romanians</b> in Trajan's Dacia"), {{completed}} between 1888 and 1893, strongly {{asserts that}} <b>the</b> <b>Romanians</b> are of predominantly Roman origin - a position further elaborated by the historian Nicolae Iorga, one of Xenopol's numerous pupils (see Origin of <b>the</b> <b>Romanians).</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{development}} of the theories was closely connected to political debates from the [...] The three political [...] "nations" [...] of the Principality of Transylvania (the Hungarians, Saxons and Székelys) enjoyed special privileges, while local legislation emphasized that <b>the</b> <b>Romanians</b> had been [...] "admitted into {{the country for the}} public good" [...] and they were only [...] "tolerated {{for the benefit of the}} country". When suggesting that <b>the</b> <b>Romanians</b> of Transylvania were the direct descendants of the Roman colonists in Emperor Trajan's Dacia, the historians of the [...] "Transylvanian School" [...] also demanded that <b>the</b> <b>Romanians</b> were to be regarded as the oldest residents of the country. The Supplex Libellus Valachoruma petition completed by the representatives of <b>the</b> local <b>Romanians</b> in 1791explicitly demanded that <b>the</b> <b>Romanians</b> should be granted the same legal status that the three privileged [...] "nations" [...] had enjoyed because <b>the</b> <b>Romanians</b> were of Roman stock.|$|R

5|$|The Corps was {{effectively}} an active military reserve of <b>the</b> <b>Romanian</b> Land Forces, and regularly dispatched new units to <b>the</b> <b>Romanian</b> front after June 1917. It helped defend the last stretches of Romania against the Central Powers' unified offensive, and met {{success in the}} Battle of Mărășești, but it still lacked a unitary command structure. When the October Revolution in Russia and <b>the</b> <b>Romanian</b> armistice took Romania out of the Entente camp, the Corps was left without backing and purpose. However, it inspired the creation of similar units in Entente countries, most successfully <b>the</b> <b>Romanian</b> Legion of Italy.|$|E
5|$|The current Romanian Land Forces {{were formed}} in 1859, {{immediately}} after the unification of Wallachia with Moldavia, and were commanded by Alexandru Ioan Cuza, Domnitor of Romania until his abdication in 1866.

50|$|Báthory {{also wanted}} {{to stop the spread}} of Reformation among <b>the</b> <b>Romanians</b> in Transylvania.

50|$|In {{the first}} days of October 1848, Stephan Ludwig Roth {{considered}} that there were two options for the Saxons: The first is to side with the Hungarians, and thus turn against <b>the</b> <b>Romanians</b> and <b>the</b> empire; the second is to side with <b>the</b> <b>Romanians,</b> and thus support the empire against the Hungarians. In this choice, <b>the</b> <b>Romanians</b> and Hungarians are incidental factors. The most important principle is that of a united empire, for it guarantees the extension of Austria's proclaimed constitution.|$|R

5|$|On 6 April 1941, the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia began, and Vardar was based at Dubovac, as the flagship of the 1st Monitor Division, responsible for <b>the</b> <b>Romanian</b> border on the Danube, under the operational {{control of the}} 3rd Infantry Division Dunavska.

5|$|Reenlisted {{prisoners of}} war formed a large section of the {{approximately}} 30,800 former Austria-Hungarian citizens who were registered as active on <b>the</b> <b>Romanian</b> side by late 1917. By the time it stopped recruiting (January 1918), the Corps had enlisted some 8,500 to 10,000 men. However, the Kornilov order came {{too late in the}} war for there to have been a more significant Transylvanian-Bukovinan contribution to <b>the</b> <b>Romanian</b> effort.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of such initiatives, Romania {{tended to}} give little {{attention}} to the potential of recruitment in Russia, as many decision-makers were still uncertain about the devotion of Transylvanians and Bukovinans, and worried that they might be welcoming Austro-Hungarian spies into army ranks. Additionally, probably half of the 120,000 men excluded themselves from the pool of recruits, as Austrian loyalists, invalids or men who had reason to fear Austria-Hungary's retaliation. Support from within Romania was therefore weak, and Russian obstruction still had a part to play, but in January the camp was visited by Lieutenant Colonel Constantin Gh. Pietraru of <b>the</b> <b>Romanian</b> Land Forces, on a mission to evaluate the recruitment project. The reversal of fortunes on <b>the</b> <b>Romanian</b> front had brought a Central Powers' invasion into southern Romania, and <b>the</b> <b>Romanian</b> military authority became pressured into finding new soldiers for the defensive action.|$|E
