40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{findings suggest}} that spreads quoted in dealership markets might be uncompetitive. This paper analyzes theoretically if price competition between risk [...] averse market [...] makers leaves room for implicit collusive behavior. We compare the spread and risk [...] sharing efficiency arising in several market structures differing in terms of i) the priority rule followed in case of ties, and ii) the type of schedules market makers may use, namely: general schedules, linear schedules, or limit orders. In general, competitive pricing does not arise in equilibrium, {{and there is a}} conflict between risk sharing efficiency and <b>the</b> <b>tightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread.</b> This conflict can be mitigated by an appropriate market structure design. The limit order market is the only market structure in which the competitive equilibrium is the unique equilibrium. ...|$|R

It is found that <b>the</b> <b>tightness</b> <b>of</b> Schrodinger-Robertson uncertainty (SUR) relation has a strict liner relationship with the mixedness of the system. As for the Robertson uncertainty relation (RUR), we find that <b>the</b> <b>tightness</b> can be enhanced by tuning the feedback {{at the beginning of the}} evolution.

40|$|The {{deflections}} of gaskets {{after initial}} tightening largely affect the residual bolt forces and <b>the</b> <b>tightness</b> <b>of</b> bolted flanged connections. The bolt forces decrease significantly {{due to the}} deflections of gaskets after initial tightening in the cases where expanded PTFE gaskets are used. The visco-elastic characteristic of the gaskets is the main cause for the phenomenon. It was shown in the paper PVP 2012 - 78694 that <b>the</b> <b>tightness</b> improved even if the bolt forces reduced in the long term. This is because the gasket becomes packed under a high gasket stress. It is important to estimate the thickness change of gaskets to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>tightness</b> <b>of</b> bolted flanged connections. In this paper, an analytical model of a bolted flanged connection, in which the flanges, the bolts and the gasket are represented by spring constants, is proposed. Experiments were carried out to measure the creep characteristic of the expanded PTFE gasket. The residual bolt forces and the deflection of the gasket were estimated based on the analytical model of the bolted flanged connection and the creep characteristic of the gasket. Thus, the relationship between gasket deflection and <b>the</b> <b>tightness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bolted flanged connection are clarified...|$|R
