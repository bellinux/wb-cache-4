5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of her chest and right knee.|$|E

Joining the Marian image are Augustinian Saints: Saint Augustine, Saint Monica and Saint Nicolas de Tolentino. Another smaller neoclassical retablo built in 1875 on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> houses the image of Saint Joseph in the main niche and Saint Isidore.|$|E

5|$|Carnotaurus was {{the first}} {{theropod}} dinosaur discovered with {{a significant number of}} fossil skin impressions. These impressions, found beneath the skeleton's right side, come from different body parts, including the lower jaw, the front of the neck, the shoulder girdle, and the rib cage. The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail. Originally, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the skull also was covered with large patches of skin—this was not recognized when the skull was prepared, and these patches were accidentally destroyed. Still, the surface texture of much of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the skull is very {{different from that of the}} left side, and probably shows some features of the scalation pattern of the head.|$|E

5|$|The Rosetta Stone is a {{fragment}} of a larger stele. No additional fragments were found in later searches of the Rosetta site. Owing to its damaged state, {{none of the three}} texts is absolutely complete. The top register, composed of Egyptian hieroglyphs, suffered the most damage. Only the last 14 lines of the hieroglyphic text can be seen; all of them are broken on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side,</b> and 12 of them on the left. The following register of demotic text has survived best; it has 32 lines, of which the first 14 are slightly damaged on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side.</b> The final register of Greek text contains 54 lines, of which the first 27 survive in full; the rest are increasingly fragmentary due to a diagonal break at the bottom right of the stone.|$|E

5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E
5|$|The {{homomorphism}} {{problem with}} a fixed graph H on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of each instance is also called the H-coloring problem. When H is the complete graph K'k, this is the graph k-coloring problem, which is solvable in polynomial time for k = 0, 1, 2, and NP-complete otherwise.|$|E

5|$|La Tante DC10 Restaurant is a {{restaurant}} located inside a converted McDonnell Douglas DC-10 formerly {{used by the}} defunct Ghana Airways.
