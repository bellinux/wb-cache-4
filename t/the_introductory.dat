5|$|The {{assembly}} kit consisted of eight groups of components, plus a carry case. The build time was advertised as being around three hours, and required {{a soldering iron}} {{and a pair of}} cutters.

5|$|Despite {{his growing}} talent, Prokofiev's parents hesitated over {{starting}} their son on a musical career {{at such an}} early age, and considered the possibility of his attending a good high school in Moscow. By 1904, his mother had decided instead on Saint Petersburg, and she and Prokofiev visited the then capital to explore the possibility of moving there for his education. They were introduced to composer Alexander Glazunov, {{a professor at the}} Saint Petersburg Conservatory, who asked to see Prokofiev and his music; Prokofiev had composed two more operas, Desert Islands and The Feast during the Plague, and was working on his fourth, Undina. Glazunov was so impressed that he urged Prokofiev's mother to have her son apply for admission to the Conservatory. He passed <b>the</b> <b>introductory</b> tests and enrolled that year.|$|E
5|$|In this treatise, Archimedes {{counts the}} number of grains of sand that will fit inside the universe. This book {{mentions}} the heliocentric theory {{of the solar system}} proposed by Aristarchus of Samos, as well as contemporary ideas {{about the size of the}} Earth and the distance between various celestial bodies. By using a system of numbers based on powers of the myriad, Archimedes concludes that {{the number of}} grains of sand required to fill the universe is 8 in modern notation. <b>The</b> <b>introductory</b> letter states that Archimedes' father was an astronomer named Phidias. The Sand Reckoner or Psammites is the only surviving work in which Archimedes discusses his views on astronomy.|$|E

5|$|State-run junior lyceums {{and area}} {{secondary}} schools are single-sex. Junior lyceums {{are divided into}} two grade stages. The first stage is an introductory stage, and runs {{for the first two}} years of secondary schooling. Students study essentially the same subjects with very limited curriculum options in order to provide a good grounding for future studies. Following the two-year introductory cycle, a three-year specialist stage occurs during which students study a common core curriculum as well as a number of elective subjects. This orientation is similar at area secondary schools, although <b>the</b> <b>introductory</b> period is longer, at three years in duration, and the final specialist period is shorter, at two years. The staff-student ratio is set at 1:11, and the school leaving age is 16.|$|E
5|$|Symmetry {{groups are}} groups {{consisting}} of symmetries of given mathematical objects—be they of geometric nature, such as <b>the</b> <b>introductory</b> symmetry {{group of the}} square, or of algebraic nature, such as polynomial equations and their solutions. Conceptually, group theory {{can be thought of}} as the study of symmetry. Symmetries in mathematics greatly simplify the study of geometrical or analytical objects. A group is said to act on another mathematical object X if every group element performs some operation on X compatibly to the group law. In the rightmost example below, an element of order 7 of the (2,3,7) triangle group acts on the tiling by permuting the highlighted warped triangles (and the other ones, too). By a group action, the group pattern is connected to the structure of the object being acted on.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} 2097, {{according}} to <b>the</b> <b>introductory</b> sequence. This sequence also provides {{the history of the}} game’s setting: in 2057, the depletion of Earth’s resources coincided with widening space exploration. After a catastrophic war over ever-declining resources, ending 10 years prior to the events of G-Police, Earth’s governments were stripped of military power. As a result, powerful corporations had exerted control over Earth and the burgeoning space colonies. The Government Police (G-Police) was formed by Earth’s remaining coalition government to maintain order in these colonies.|$|E

5|$|The team at Revolution {{had high}} {{expectations}} for Broken Sword, but there was significant competition. Revolution had a team that had created successful adventure games, but believed they needed to utilise the best of other creative industries. Eoghan Cahill and Neil Breen of Dublin's Don Bluth studios drew the backgrounds in pencil and digitally colored them in Photoshop. <b>The</b> <b>introductory</b> sequence and the main characters were done by animator Mike Burgess, {{who worked for the}} Red Rover animation studio. The game's graphics were animated in a style resembling classic animated films.|$|E
5|$|The user {{interface}} and menus {{were created by}} Joe Kowalski, who had previously worked on similar game elements for Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, and the Rock Band series. Much of the game's interface elements used a medieval woodcut art style, and were designed to contrast well against the world's graphics. <b>The</b> <b>introductory</b> menu is presented as an interactive movie created from live action clips of Jack Black manipulating a prop gatefold vinyl record album, using Adobe After Effects to provide the on-screen text, controls handling, and stitching of separate scenes into a seamless movie.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a limited}} number of effects and, aside from brief {{ballpark}} jingles, there is no real background music present during the game. For example, the charge fanfare is played at random points and <b>the</b> <b>introductory</b> screen begins with a different baseball tune while the player is loading up and selecting his team, along with a home run fanfare. Generic sound effects include the bat cracking upon contact with the ball, the sound of the ball flying through the air during a pitch, bouncing and throwing effects, and a stream of crowd noises.|$|E

5|$|When {{the first}} {{novel of the}} series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (published in America and other {{countries}} as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) opens, {{it is apparent that}} some significant event has taken place in the Wizarding World – an event so very remarkable, even Muggles (non-magical people) notice signs of it. The full background to this event and Harry Potter's past is revealed gradually through the series. After <b>the</b> <b>introductory</b> chapter, the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, and it is at this point that his magical background begins to be revealed.|$|E
5|$|While the {{dramatic}} {{portions of the}} movie are shot in an obviously cinematic style, the bout between Balboa and Dixon is shot {{in a number of}} different ways. The lead-in to the bout, as well as the first two rounds, are shot in a style similar to a major pay-per-view broadcast. Clips from fights in previous Rocky movies are used during <b>the</b> <b>introductory</b> teaser to introduce Balboa, while stock footage from actual Tarver fights, as well as footage from Dixon's previous fight (shown at the beginning of the film) are used as clips for Dixon's part of the teaser. The fight itself was shot in High Definition to further enhance the TV-style look of the fight.|$|E
5|$|As {{the radio}} {{programme}} became popular, daily newspapers in Pune began printing {{the lyrics of}} the new songs each week. The publication department of All India Radio also compiled the lyrics and excerpts from <b>the</b> <b>introductory</b> comments in a book form. The 179-page volume, then priced at 2, was launched on 3 October 1957 {{on the occasion of}} Vijayadashami. In 1965, the HMV released ten LPs featuring the voice of Sudhir Phadke. In 1968, the Gramophone Company of India released a 10-cassette set, again featuring Phadke's voice, and 50,000 records were sold. Madgulkar's son, Anand, produced a televised version showcasing twenty-eight episodes of the Geet Ramayan on Zee Marathi; however, it received a lukewarm response. He has also written a book, Geet Ramayanache Ramayan, describing the making of the radio programme. Live shows of Geet Ramayan are still produced on occasion of Rama Navami.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} {{team also}} pre-visualized rough drafts to sketch ideas {{for others to}} advance. For example, <b>the</b> <b>introductory</b> airplane level was pre-visualized two years prior to its creation as a demonstration for the development team and publisher. Levels were built in Volition's Core Technology Group (CTG) editor, which was continually built {{in the four years}} preceding release. Like the other two titles, Saints Row: The Third was built in the Havok physics engine with customizations. The engine let the team build vehicle drifting physics and the VTOL aircraft. The studio considered the Red Faction series' Geo-Mod 2 engine but chose against it due to the implementation's difficulty and not wanting that degree of destruction. Phillips gave a game development postmortem at the 2012 Game Developers Conference, where he advised studios to let development team members run with their ideas. Volition began to add modding support to the title and series in mid 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} scene in which Eminem stands on the rooftop of the Manhattan Municipal Building in New York, saying <b>the</b> <b>introductory</b> lyrics. The video cuts between scenes where he raps on the rooftop and another scene where Eminem is trapped inside a dark basement. Eminem moves closer towards the edge of the {{building}} until he leaves to go downstairs as the chorus begins. He starts walking down Market Street in Newark and jaywalks across the street, avoiding vehicles that pass by. Eminem sees distorted reflections of himself on the window of a car; he continues on, only to be surrounded by a series of mirrors. Confused, Eminem tries to escape, and {{towards the end of the}} second chorus, he breaks through a mirror to find himself in the middle of the street. Interspersing scenes show Eminem as he tries to break out of the basement. As the camera zooms out, the viewers see him on the edge of a destroyed street while a subway tunnel can be seen below the road.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} {{virtually}} {{the same in the}} DS version, but with some major differences in <b>the</b> <b>introductory</b> sequence: Luneth goes to the Altar Cave alone, but while exploring he trips and falls into a hole created by the earthquake. He is then beset by goblins, and while he is frantically searching for a way out, he comes upon the wind crystal. It tells him that he has been chosen as a Warrior of Light, destined to restore balance to the world, and there are three others like him, but before Luneth can ask it to elaborate, he is teleported to the surface. He returns to Ur, but Elder Topapa does not elucidate much on the matter. Going to a corner of town, Luneth finds his friend Arc being bullied by some of the kids. When Luneth intervenes, Arc runs away, heading for the village of Kazus.|$|E
