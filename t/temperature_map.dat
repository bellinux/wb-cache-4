40|$|PURPOSE: To {{reconstruct}} proton resonance frequency-shift <b>temperature</b> <b>maps</b> free {{of chemical}} shift distortions. THEORY AND METHODS: Tissue heating created by thermal therapies such as focused ultrasound surgery {{results in a}} change in proton resonance frequency that causes geometric distortions in the image and calculated <b>temperature</b> <b>maps,</b> {{in the same manner}} as other chemical shift and off-resonance distortions if left uncorrected. We propose an online-compatible algorithm to correct these distortions in 2 DFT and echo-planar imaging acquisitions, which is based on a k-space signal model that accounts for proton resonance frequency change-induced phase shifts both up to and during the readout. The method was evaluated with simulations, gel phantoms, and in vivo <b>temperature</b> <b>maps</b> from brain, soft tissue tumor, and uterine fibroid focused ultrasound surgery treatments. RESULTS: Without chemical shift correction, peak temperature and thermal dose measurements were spatially offset by approximately 1 mm in vivo. Spatial shifts increased as readout bandwidth decreased, as shown by up to 4 -fold greater temperature hot spot asymmetry in uncorrected <b>temperature</b> <b>maps.</b> In most cases, the computation times to correct maps at peak heat were less than 10 ms, without parallelization. CONCLUSION: Heat-induced proton resonance frequency changes create chemical shift distortions in <b>temperature</b> <b>maps</b> resulting from MR-guided focused ultrasound surgery ablations, but the distortions can be corrected using an online-compatible algorithm...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{techniques that}} can be used to reduce or eliminate artefacts arising due to magnetic field disturbances and/or motion in <b>temperature</b> <b>maps</b> obtained by the Proton Resonance Frequency Shift (PRFS) method of MRI <b>temperature</b> <b>mapping.</b> The first chapter describes a hardware modification, which enables PRFS <b>temperature</b> <b>mapping</b> during percutaneous transluminal angioplasty performed using a hot balloon. It is proposed to separate in time media injection and heating by first inflating a balloon with a media at an initial temperature, and then by heating the media up using laser light. The separation is shown to eliminate flow, motion and susceptibility-redistribution artefacts and to enable real-time MRI <b>temperature</b> <b>mapping</b> using the PRFS technique. The second chapter describes a post-processing technique, which eliminates temperature artefacts caused by breathing. A set of baseline images characterizing Respiratory Induced Resonance Offset (RIRO) at a variety of respiratory cycle instants is acquired before the thermal treatment starts. During the treatment, the temperature evolution is found from two successive images. Then, the calculated temperature changes are corrected for the additional contribution caused by RIRO using the pre-treatment baseline images acquired at the identical instances of the respiratory cycle. The third chapter describes an acquisition and post-processing technique, which utilizes the fat signal to improve the immunity of the PRFS method of MRI <b>temperature</b> <b>mapping</b> against magnetic field disturbances. The described method is based on the utilization of several gradient and spin echoes acquired within one repetition interval with water and fat-selective scans. The fourth chapter describes an approach to post-processing PRFS <b>temperature</b> <b>maps</b> acquired during High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) treatments, which allows the user to extract from the maps some additional information {{that can be}} used to monitor the treatment in a more safe and reliable way as well as to adjust the treatment in case it deviates from the desired scenario. A set of mathematical operations (including discrete analogues of time derivative, directional derivative, gradient and Laplacian) is applied to <b>temperature</b> <b>maps</b> to reveal the HIFU beam waist, focus, heat deposition site and their evolution during sonications. The location of the maximum temperature spot is identified and traced as well as its displacements are visualized and characterized. The resulting images reveal the information, which is usually hidden on the traditional <b>temperature</b> <b>maps...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. MR guided {{interstitial}} {{laser therapy}} {{can be used}} to monitor the extent of tumor tissue coagulation during thermal treatment based on a <b>temperature</b> <b>map.</b> In a non-stationary object that was influenced by respiratory motion, the <b>temperature</b> <b>map</b> may show errors due to incorrect spatial baseline images. Moreover, an unwanted phase shift due to object displacement contributes to errors in the <b>temperature</b> <b>map,</b> that must be suppressed. This paper describes a strategy which addresses the difficulties of MR guided interstitial laser therapy in the presence of respiratory motion. The multi-baseline images, supported by the displacement correction scheme, were used to improve the temporal resolution of a <b>temperature</b> <b>map</b> in the respiratory cycle. In the displacement correction scheme, the object coordinates that are provided by an active tracking coil were employed to support a matching strategy between the thermal and baseline images. To avoid errors in the <b>temperature</b> <b>map</b> due to the motion artifact, a detector of low quality images was proposed as part of the displacement correction scheme. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} brain {{temperature}} {{is important for}} a number of clinical conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, schizophrenia and birth asphyxia (for neonates). A direct method to estimate brain temperature non-invasively will allow assessment of brain thermoregulation and its variation in clinical conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging is a powerful technique widely used for diagnosis of a range of neurological conditions. All magnetic resonance procedures involve manipulation of the hydrogen nuclei in the water molecules of the human body. The resonance frequency of the water molecules is temperature dependent, thus MR thermometry is a powerful tool for non-invasive temperature measurement. Using internal reference MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), absolute brain <b>temperature</b> <b>maps</b> can be estimated. However a number of temperature independent factors influence MRSI data acquisition, thus a thorough validation is necessary and is the focus of this PhD study. In this PhD study using phantom (test object) studies it was shown that optimization of the MRSI pulse sequence is necessary to reduce systematic error in <b>temperature</b> <b>maps</b> and extensive in-vitro validation of MRSI <b>temperature</b> <b>mapping</b> was performed. A custom made temperature-controlled phantom was designed for this purpose and is presented in this thesis.
