5|$|Variation of {{the wing}} beat may also occur, not just amongst {{different}} species, but even among individuals at different times. In general, the frequency is dependent upon the ratio between the power {{of the wing}} muscles and the resistance of the load. Large-winged, light-bodied butterflies may have a wing beat frequency of 4–20 per second whereas small-winged, heavy-bodied flies and bees beat their wings more than 100 times a second and mosquitoes can beat up to 988–1046 times a second. The same goes for flight; though it is generally difficult to estimate the speed of insects in flight, most insects can probably fly faster in nature <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> controlled experiments.|$|E
5|$|Two life-history {{features}} of amphibians are {{often cited as}} a reason why amphibians are good indicators of environmental health or 'canaries in the coal mine'. Like all amphibians, the long-toed salamander has both an aquatic and terrestrial life transition and semipermeable skin. Since they serve different ecological functions in the water <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> land, the loss of one amphibian species {{is equivalent to the}} loss of two ecological species. The second notion is that amphibians, such as long-toed salamanders, are more susceptible to the absorption of pollutants because they naturally absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The validity of this special sensitivity to environmental pollutants, however, has been called into question. The problem is more complex, because not all amphibians are equally susceptible to environmental damage because there is such a diverse array of life histories among species.|$|E

5|$|Freshwater marl prairies {{are similar}} to sloughs, but lack the slow {{movement}} of surface water; instead, water seeps through a calcitic mud called marl. Algae and other microscopic organisms form periphyton, which attaches to limestone. When it dries {{it turns into a}} gray mud. Sawgrass and other water plants grow shorter in freshwater marl <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> peat, the other type of soil in the Everglades which is found where water remains present longer throughout the year. Marl prairies are usually under water from three to seven months of the year, whereas sloughs may remain submerged for longer than nine months and sometimes remain under water from one year to the next. Sawgrass may dominate sloughs, creating a monoculture. Other grasses, such as muhly grass (Muhlenbergia filipes) and broad-leafed water plants can be found in marl prairies. Animals living in the freshwater sloughs also inhabit marl prairies. Marl prairies may go dry {{in some parts of the}} year; alligators play a vital role in maintaining life in remote parts of the Everglades by burrowing in the mud during the dry season, creating pools of water where fish and amphibians survive from one year to the next. Alligator holes also attract other animals who congregate to feed on smaller prey. When the region floods again during the wet season, the fish and amphibians who were sustained in the alligator holes then repopulate freshwater marl prairies.|$|E

Conversely, Greece and some Eurozone peers such as Ireland and Spain, several countries in the Gulf, Israel, Equatorial Guinea, the USA and Venezuela do worse in the HSI than in GDP per capita or HDI.

25|$|Cannabinoid binding sites exist {{throughout}} {{the central and}} peripheral nervous systems. The two most relevant receptors for cannabinoids are the CB1 and CB2 receptors, which are expressed predominantly {{in the brain and}} immune system respectively. Density of expression varies based on species and correlates with the efficacy that cannabinoids will have in modulating specific aspects of behavior related to the site of expression. For example, in rodents, the highest concentration of cannabinoid binding sites are in the basal ganglia and cerebellum, regions of the brain involved in the initiation and coordination of movement. In humans, cannabinoid receptors exist in much lower concentration in these regions, which helps explain why cannabinoids possess a greater efficacy in altering rodent motor movements <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> humans.|$|E
25|$|In Western cultures, {{predictors}} of happiness include elements that support personal independence, {{a sense of}} personal agency, and self-expression. In Eastern cultures, {{predictors of}} happiness focus on an interdependent self that is inseparable from significant others. Compared to people in individualistic cultures, people in collectivistic cultures are more likely to base their judgments of life satisfaction on how significant others appraise their life than on the balance of inner emotions experienced as pleasant versus unpleasant. Pleasant emotional experiences have a stronger social component in East Asian cultures compared to Western ones. For example, people in Japan are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally engaging emotions (such as friendly feelings), whereas people in the United States are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally disengaging emotions (pride, for example). There are also cultural differences in motives and goals associated with happiness. For example, Asian Americans tend to experience greater happiness after achieving goals that are pleasing to or approved of by significant others compared to European Americans. There is also evidence that high self-esteem, {{a sense of personal}} control and a consistent sense of identity relate more strongly to SWB in Western cultures <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> Eastern ones. However, {{this is not to say}} that these things are unimportant to SWB in Eastern cultures. Research has found that even within Eastern cultures, people with high self-esteem and a more consistent sense of identity are somewhat happier than those who are low in these characteristics. There is no evidence that low self-esteem and so on are actually beneficial to SWB in any known culture.|$|E

2500|$|A few {{comparative}} {{studies have found}} that cancer survival rates vary more widely among different populations in the U.S. <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> Canada.

Furthermore, they found that the American survival advantage in the four highest quintiles was statistically significant. They strongly suspected that the difference due to prostate cancer was a result of greater detection of asymptomatic cases in the U.S. [...] Their data indicates that neglecting the prostate cancer data reduces the American advantage in the four highest quintiles and gives Canada a statistically significant advantage in the lowest quintile. [...] Similarly, they believe differences in screening mammography may explain part of the American advantage in breast cancer.

2500|$|While {{they fight}} pathogens, {{neutrophils}} also release inflammatory cytokines and enzymes that damage cells. [...] One of their important jobs {{is to produce}} Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) to kill bacteria, for which they use an enzyme called myeloperoxidase. [...] The enzymes and ROS produced by neutrophils and other leukocytes damage cells and prevent cell proliferation and wound closure by damaging DNA, lipids, proteins, the extracellular matrix (ECM), and cytokines that speed healing. [...] Neutrophils remain in chronic wounds for longer <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> acute wounds, {{and contribute to the}} fact that chronic wounds have higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and ROS. [...] Since wound fluid from chronic wounds has an excess of proteases and ROS, the fluid itself can inhibit healing by inhibiting cell growth and breaking down growth factors and proteins in the ECM. This impaired healing response is considered uncoordinated. However, soluble mediators of the immune system (growth factors), cell-based therapies and therapeutic chemicals can propagate coordinated healing.|$|E

An instance of this was Philadelphia Phillies manager Charlie Manuel, who did not call upon closer Jonathan Papelbon in high leverage situations during the 2012 season, including six games where the score was tied during the late innings, which may have cost the team seven wins by midseason. Jonah Keri suggested [...] "fear of using pitchers in anything but the most predictable circumstances, or simple inertia, closers get used far more often in easy-to-manage, up-two, bases-empty, ninth-inning situations <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>in</b> tie games with runners on and the game actually on the line" [...] and said of Papelbon [...] "unless the Phillies start using him in situations where he’s actually needed, rather than almost exclusively in spots that nearly any pitcher with a pulse can handle successfully 85–90 percent of the time, Papelbon will remain the $200,000 Aston Martin that never leaves the garage".|$|E
