5|$|O you, Son, who, {{concealed}} in your mother's womb, you gather together peoples by your Father's act – for I perchance {{am able to}} compose a holy narrative because you are seen to be God, because, glorious one, <b>the</b> <b>glittering</b> stars show (you) to the world; and I ask, after the close of my life, that you grant {{to me from the}} throne of heaven to take a tiny gift because of the honour (I have) attained.|$|E
5|$|In December 1888, the Chiswick Press {{published}} Morris' The House of the Wolfings, {{a fantasy}} story set in Iron Age Europe {{which provides a}} reconstructed portrait {{of the lives of}} Germanic-speaking Gothic tribes. It contained both prose and aspects of poetic verse. A sequel, The Roots of the Mountains, followed in 1890. Over the coming years he would publish a string of other poetic works; The Story of <b>the</b> <b>Glittering</b> Plain (1890), The Wood Beyond the World (1894), The Well at the World's End (1896), The Water of the Wondrous Isles (1897) and The Sundering Flood (1898). He also embarked on a translation of the Anglo-Saxon tale, Beowulf; because he could not fully understand Old English, his poetic translation was based largely on that already produced by A.J. Watts. On publication, Morris' Beowulf would be critically panned. Following the death of the sitting Poet Laureate of Great Britain and Ireland, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, in October 1892, Morris was offered the position, but turned it down, disliking its associations with the monarchy and political establishment; instead the position went to Alfred Austin.|$|E

50|$|So Darius is {{transformed}} {{and sees the}} world at a whole new perspective. He now knows that value is not just money. He decides that if Marguerite likes <b>the</b> <b>Glitter</b> Pool for its beauty, then others will too. He decides to give the town the gift {{of being able to}} see <b>the</b> <b>Glitter</b> Pool. But first, he needed to fix up <b>the</b> <b>Glitter</b> Pool so that it was fit and safe for visiting.After requesting help from friends to fix up the pool and getting really excited about the revelation of <b>the</b> <b>Glitter</b> Pool, Darius discovers that <b>the</b> <b>Glitter</b> Pool can’t be used as the gift because it is on the land {{that is part of the}} Bell estate.Darius and his family have no choice but to give a barrel of vegetables as their gift and the mayor starts mocking them, but then Hector (Darius’ father) stands up to Mayor Podcock and makes him feel like dirt. Darius then realises that an extreme gift wasn’t necessary, not even <b>the</b> <b>Glitter</b> Pool. He also learns that a gift is better given from free will rather than from obligation.Afterwards, as the Bells are driving home, they notice that heaps of people are crowded around <b>the</b> <b>Glitter</b> Pool, and Darius’ parents find out about everything that Darius has done and they are very proud of him. Even Cyrus, Darius’ older brother who is convinced that Darius is completely useless admits that he is not a complete waste of space.|$|R

5|$|In January 1891, Morris began {{renting a}} cottage near to Kelmscott House, No. 16 Upper Mall in Hammersmith, which {{would serve as}} the first {{premises}} of the Kelmscott Press, before relocating to the neighbouring No. 14 in May, that same month in which the company was founded. Devoted {{to the production of}} books which he deemed beautiful, Morris was artistically influenced by the illustrated manuscripts and early printed books of Medieval and Early Modern Europe. Before publishing its first work, Morris ensured that he had mastered the techniques of printing and secured supplies of hand-made paper and vellum which would be necessary for production. Over the next seven years, they would publish 66 volumes. The first of these would be one of Morris' own novels, The Story of <b>the</b> <b>Glittering</b> Plain, which was published in May 1891 and soon sold out. The Kelmscott Press would go on to publish 23 of Morris' books, more than those of any other author. The press also published editions of works by Keats, Shelley, Ruskin, and Swinburne, as well as copies of various Medieval texts. A number of the Press' books contained illustrations provided by Burne-Jones. The Press' magnum opus would be the Kelmscott Chaucer, which had taken years to complete and included 87 illustrations from Burne-Jones. Morris still remained firmly in an employer relation with those working at the Press, although organised outings for them and paid them above average wages.|$|E

50|$|Light {{reflects}} from {{smooth surface}}s by specular reflection. A rippled but locally smooth surface {{such as water}} with waves will reflect the sun at different angles at each point {{on the surface of}} the waves. As a result, a viewer in the right position will see many small images of the sun, formed by portions of waves that are oriented correctly to reflect the sun's light to the viewer's eyes. The exact pattern seen depends on the viewer's precise location. The color and the length of <b>the</b> <b>glitter</b> depend on <b>the</b> altitude of the Sun. The lower the sun, the longer and more reddish <b>the</b> <b>glitter</b> is. When <b>the</b> sun is really low above <b>the</b> horizon, <b>the</b> <b>glitter</b> breaks because of the waves, which could sometimes obstruct the sun and cast a shadow on <b>the</b> <b>glitter.</b>|$|R

25|$|In Rohan {{the heir}} apparent, Théodred, was killed, and, during the Battle of Pelennor Fields, King Théoden died as well. He was succeeded by his nephew Éomer. In <b>the</b> <b>Glittering</b> Caves at the Hornburg, a Dwarven colony was established, and Isengard {{was given to}} the Ents to be renamed the Treegarth of Orthanc.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Gimli the Dwarf, {{who fought}} in that battle, {{established}} a colony of Durin's folk there. Aglarond lay {{in front of a}} huge and very beautiful cave system, which proved irresistible to him. Gimli became known as 'the Lord of <b>the</b> <b>Glittering</b> Caves', although this new realm was presumably under the overlordship of Thorin Stonehelm, his kinsman and heir of the lordship of all Durin's Folk. The dwarves of Aglarond restored the Hornburg following the War of the Ring, and it became a fortress they shared with the Rohirrim.|$|E
25|$|After the {{destruction}} of the One Ring, Legolas remained in Minas Tirith for Aragorn's crowning and marriage to Arwen. Later, Legolas and Gimli travelled together through Fangorn forest and to <b>the</b> <b>Glittering</b> Caves of Helm's Deep, as Legolas had promised Gimli. Eventually, Legolas founded an Elf-colony in Ithilien and spent his remaining time helping to restore the devastated forests there. It was told in the Red Book of Westmarch (first written by Bilbo Baggins, continued by Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee and finally passed down through the Gamgee family), that after Aragorn's death in the year 120 of the Fourth Age, Legolas built a grey ship and left Middle-earth to go over the Sea to Valinor, and that Gimli went with him.|$|E

500|$|Éowyn {{was to have}} {{a greater}} role in {{defending}} the refugees in <b>the</b> <b>Glittering</b> Caves from Uruk-hai intruders, while in Osgiliath, Faramir {{was to have a}} vision of Frodo becoming like Gollum, with Frodo and Sam having an extended fight sequence. Filmed for The Return of the King were two scenes present in the book; Sam using the Phial of Galadriel to pass the Watchers at Cirith Ungol, and further epilogue footage, with endings for Legolas and Gimli, Éowyn and Faramir's wedding and Aragorn's death and funeral. Sauron was to fight Aragorn at the Black Gate, but with Jackson deciding the scene was inappropriate, a computer-generated Troll was used instead. To give context for Wormtongue killing Saruman, and Legolas in turn killing Wormtongue, it was to be revealed Wormtongue poisoned Théodred. The final scene cut was Aragorn having his armour fitted for the Battle of the Black Gate by the trilogy's armourers, which was the final scene filmed during principal photography. Peter Jackson has stated {{that he would like to}} include some of these unused scenes in a future [...] "Ultimate Edition" [...] home video release, also including out-takes.|$|E
500|$|Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone said, [...] " [...] {{voice is}} so processed, its physicality almost disappears. [...] In the Zone offers strip-club, 1-900 sex, {{accommodating}} and hollow. Beyond <b>the</b> <b>glittering</b> beats, Spears sounds about as intimate as a blowup doll." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated, [...] "Britney's fourth album, In The Zone, finds the pop tart {{coming of age}} with a bold mix of hip-hop and dance music, wiping clean the last traces of her bubblegum-pop past. [...] For the most part, In The Zone is a big, fat, thumping love letter to the dancefloor, which makes Madonna's involvement [...] even more appropriate." [...] Dorian Lynskey of The Guardian commented, [...] "Unlike previous Britney albums, In the Zone has no filler and no shoddy cover versions, just 57 varieties of blue-chip hit-factory pop. There is southern hip-hop, deep house, Neptunes-style R, the ubiquitous Diwali beat and, most importantly, oodles of Madonna." [...] Jason King of Vibe deemed it as [...] "A supremely confident dance record that also illustrates Spears's development as a songwriter." [...] "Toxic" [...] won Spears her first and so far only Grammy Award, for Best Dance Recording at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards (2005).|$|E

Rating it {{four out of five}} stars, Lewis Corner from Digital Spy complimented the vocal mix on the album, adding that [...] "Cheek to Cheek may not be <b>the</b> <b>glittering</b> spectacle we've come to expect from Lady Gaga, but with Tony Bennett's guidance the pair have delivered an authentic and solid jazz record that respects the genre's generous history. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars and praised Gaga's vocals. Dolan felt the album [...] "proves she can be a sophisticated lady". Charles J. Gan from Associated Press also praised Bennett and Gaga's singing, writing that [...] "Had she been born in an earlier era, Gaga would have been right at home in an MGM musical". Idolator's Bianca Gracie described the album as [...] "a refreshing listen that highlights the undeniable talent of both Bennett and Gaga and how well they work together". Writing for the National Post, Mike Doherty observed that Gaga took [...] "liberties with the beat, bends notes, purrs and whoops away" [...] with the vocals, while Bennett was able to complement with his characteristic [...] "dapper approach".|$|E
