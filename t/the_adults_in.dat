5|$|The {{life cycles}} of insects vary but most hatch from eggs. Insect growth is {{constrained}} by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series of molts. The immature stages can differ from <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> <b>in</b> structure, habit and habitat, and can include a passive pupal stage in those groups that undergo four-stage metamorphosis (see holometabolism). Insects that undergo three-stage metamorphosis lack a pupal stage and adults develop {{through a series of}} nymphal stages. The higher level relationship of the Hexapoda is unclear. Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era, including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70cm (22–28in). The most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plants.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{government}} {{believed that}} security would {{come with a}} larger population, {{but was unable to}} attract colonists from Spain or from other New World colonies. By the late 18th century, Texas was one of the least populated regions of New Spain, with fewer than two inhabitants per square league. The population was relatively stagnant, having grown only to 3,169individuals in 1790 from 3,103 in 1777. Over half of the population was classified as Spaniards, with settled Indians making up the next largest category. Blacks, mostly slaves, made up less than 1% of the population in 1777, and only 2.2% of the 1793 census. Over two-thirds of <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> <b>in</b> Texas were married, and single men outnumbered single women, although there was a high percentage of widows. Intermarriage was fairly common, mostly between white men and women of mixed origin. Children from these unions often passed as whites. Illegitimate births increased steadily throughout the century, reaching 20% of all births in 1799. Despite the small population, however, Spain actively discouraged immigration to Texas, and a permanent garrison was placed in Nacogdoches in 1790 to keep foreigners from settling in the area. Immigrants from the United States were allowed to settle in Louisiana and Florida after taking an oath of allegiance, but were not required to convert to Roman Catholicism.|$|E

Unfortunately {{from the point}} of view of <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> <b>in</b> the community, marriage rates among communally raised children were equally low. This conservatism on the part of kibbutz children has been attributed to the Westermarck effect—a form of reverse sexual imprinting whereby even unrelated children, if raised together from an early age, tend to reject each other as potential partners. The children who grew up together in the children's houses considered their peers brothers and sisters and had close lasting bonds with each other.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyse how <b>adults</b> <b>in</b> {{preschool}} staff reason about circle time and its purpose as well as children’s participation and planning. The study was conducted as qualitative interviews with four <b>adults</b> <b>in</b> preschool staff. Results from the study show that the planning of the circle time is the responsibility of every <b>adult</b> <b>in</b> preschool staff and demands a grounded and a thoughtful view. <b>The</b> <b>adult</b> <b>in</b> preschool staff also claim that is important to have the children active and included in circle time and that they should be in focus. There are three main reasons why <b>adult</b> <b>in</b> preschool staff decide to have circle time with the children. There are reasons to encourage language, social and emotional development. The literature, however, takes up the collection's purpose is more about providing security, community and school preparation.

Both <b>adult</b> <b>in</b> preschool staff and literature speaks of confirmation and community but <b>the</b> <b>adult</b> <b>in</b> preschool staff does not speak about school preparatory activity that reason that they have set.

25|$|Ropalidia revolutionalis is an independent-founding wasp {{species that}} begins {{building}} nests each spring.

25|$|Research on {{the human}} {{capacity}} for language provides strong support for a nativist view. Firstly, language is a species characteristic of humans: No human society has ever been discovered that does not employ a language, and all medically able children acquire at least one language in early childhood. The typical five-year-old can already use most, if not all, of the grammatical structures that {{are found in the}} language of the surrounding community. Yet, the knowledge of grammar is tacit: Neither the five-year-old nor <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> <b>in</b> the community can easily articulate the principles of the grammar they are following. Experimental evidence shows that infants come equipped with presuppositions that allow them to acquire the rules of their language.|$|E

Activity is highest on wet nights; the newts usually stay hidden during daytime. There is often an increase in activity in late summer and autumn, when the newts likely move closer to their breeding sites. Over most of their range, they hibernate in winter, using mainly subterranean hiding places, where many individuals will often congregate. In their southern range, they may instead sometimes aestivate during the dry months of summer.|$|E

He shot the teenage characters slightly below eye level to create the impression of looking up at an adult, and shot the adults slightly above eye level as if the viewer were looking down at a child. He said that hypocrisy was [...] "at the top of the list" [...] of the themes he wanted to explore in the story. While all of <b>the</b> <b>adults</b> <b>in</b> the film are attempting to live perfect lives, they cannot see that their children are driven to suicide, antidepressant addiction and kidnapping [...] for instance, Terri is so obsessed with her upcoming wedding that she does not realize her son is missing.|$|E

500|$|The third season, {{which was}} filmed in 1983 and {{consisted}} of 130 half-hour episodes, had different goals than the previous seasons. [...] One of its goals was instructing its viewers and their families about basic hygiene, [...] "a matter of critical importance {{in an area of}} the world where gastrointestinal diseases abound and infant mortality rates are high". [...] The third season of the show included characters created to [...] "expose young Latin American children to both traditional and nontraditional role models". [...] The producers created characters that demonstrated family diversity, in order to fulfill their curriculum goal of presenting more egalitarian lifestyles by modeling overcoming stereotypes, demonstrating different career options for both men and women, and exhibiting the sharing of household responsibilities. [...] They cast performers in two different families. [...] The first family was more traditional {{and consisted of}} a middle-aged couple named Tono, a mechanic (played by Maurico Herrara), and Alicia, a public health nurse (Alicia de Bari), who had two children. [...] <b>The</b> <b>adults</b> <b>in</b> the second family were young working professionals; the wife was a veterinarian and the husband was a music teacher who worked from home. [...] Other human characters included: Jose, a shopkeeper and his young assistant, a student named Mercedes (Xochiti Vigil): a truck driver played by Tony Diaz; and a pilot (Fernando Balzaretti), who travelled throughout Latin American and came home to tell his adventures to his friends on the plaza.

[...] "He was laid-back, knowledgeable, and forthright, the cool uncle you wished you'd had."

[...] The Wall Street Journal Robert J. Toth writes, [...] "The cover adds another layer of autobiography. On the front, we see Mr. Fagen as a crew-cut deejay on the graveyard shift. On the back is his audience, a single lighted window in a row of tract homes — or maybe the artist as a young man, drinking in inspiration." [...] Robert Palmer, of The New York Times, continued in this line of thinking: [...] "Inside, there's a teenager with his ear next to a portable radio. He's playing it softly, so his parents won't wake up, and he can barely make out the sounds through the static. [...] The teenager was Donald Fagen." ...|$|E
