40|$|The human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) US 28 gene product, pUS 28, is a G protein-coupled receptor that {{interacts with}} both CC and CX 3 C chemokines. To date, {{the role of}} pUS 28 in immune evasion and cell migration has been studied only in cell types that can establish productive HCMV infection. We show that HCMV can latently infect THP- 1 monocytes and that during latency US 28 is transcribed. We also show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> sustained during differentiation of the THP- 1 monocytes. Since cells expressing pUS 28 were previously shown to adhere to immobilized CX 3 C chemokines (C. A. Haskell, M. D. Cleary, and I. F. Charo, J. Biol. Chem. 275 : 34183 – 34189, 2000), we hypothesize that latently infected circulating monocytes express pUS 28, thereby enabling adhesion of these cells to CX 3 C-exposing endothelium. Consequently, the US 28 -encoded chemokine receptor may {{play an important role}} in dissemination of latent HCMV...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for transcribing drums from {{polyphonic}} music using a network of connected hidden Markov models (HMMs). The task is to detect the temporal locations of unpitched percussive sounds (such as bass drum or hi-hat) and recognise the instruments played. Contrary to many earlier methods, a separate sound event segmentation is not done, but connected HMMs are used to perform the segmentation and recognition jointly. Two ways of using HMMs are studied: modelling combinations of the target drums and a detector-like modelling of each target drum. Acoustic feature parametrisation is done with mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and their first-order temporal derivatives. The effect of lowering the feature dimensionality with principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis is evaluated. Unsupervised acoustic model parameter adaptation with maximum likelihood linear regression is evaluated for compensating {{the differences between the}} training and target signals. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on a publicly available data set containing signals with and without accompaniment, and compared with two reference methods. The results suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> possible using connected HMMs, and that using detector-like models for each target drum provides a better performance than modelling drum combinations.|$|E

Our previous work {{established that the}} promoter of the fengycin synthetase operon is located 86 nucleotides upstream of the translational initiation codon of fenC. This investigation involved transcriptional fusions with a DNA fragment that contains the region between positions − 105 and + 80 and determined that deleting the region between positions − 55 and − 42 reduces the promoter activity by 64. 5 %. Transcriptional fusions in the B. subtilis DB 2 chromosome also indicated that mutating the sequence markedly reduces the promoter activity. An in vitro transcription analysis confirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> inefficient when the sequence in this region is mutated. Electrophoretic mobility shift and footprinting analyses demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit binds to the region between positions − 55 and − 39. These {{results indicated that the}} sequence is an UP element. Finally, this UP element is critical for the production of fengycin, since mutating the UP sequence in the chromosome of B. subtilis F 29 - 3 reduces the transcription of the fen operon by 85 % and prevents the cells from producing enough fengycin to suppress the germination of Paecilomyces variotii spores on agar plates...|$|E
40|$|According to {{international}} human genome sequencing consortium 2004 [43], {{it was known}} that only less than 2 % of the total human genome code for proteins. This ignited quite a surprise in the scientific community. Since then, a lot of researchers are attracted towards the noncoding part of the genome. There are explosion of researches addressing {{the role of the}} 98 % of the human untranslated regions of the genome. This shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> not only limited to the protein coding regions of the genome rather more than 90 % of the genome are likely to be transcribed. [43] This will result in the transcription of tens and thousands of the long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) with little or no coding potential. However, the molecular mechanism and function of long noncoding RNAs are still an open research topic. Although the functions of limited lncRNAs are identified, there is still a gap in identifying the function of novel lncRNAs. This project implements different computational methods to predict the function of novel lncRNAs identified from TCGA glioblastoma multiforme samples. The methods used in this functional prediction include both expression and sequence-based analysis approach. In expression-based analysis, the co-expressing genes with lncRNAs are used to predict the possible functional relation. In sequence based analysis, the gene-protein and lncRNA-protein interactions together with miRNA-lncRNA interactions are considered towards the possible functional predictions. The result from the integrated functional prediction on the novel lncRNAs show that TCGA_gbm 3 - 153501 novel lncRNA which is co-expressed together with the THBS 1 gene with correlation coefficient of more that 0. 5 is predicted to function in cell-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions, platelet aggregation, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis. [202] MSI 1, RBM 3 and RBM 8 A are RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that have binding site on both the first top five differentially expressed lncRNAs which are TCGA_gbm- 2 - 104096501, TCGA_gbm- 3 - 153501, TCGA_gbm- 5 - 63687001 and TCGA_gbm- 17 - 10671251 and IGF 2 which is among the top 10 differentially expressed genes. Therefore, these lncRNAs are predicted to have functional role in cell proliferation and maintenance of stem cells in the central nervous system...|$|E

We also demonstrated RNA x DNA complex formation of the (dA) 34 x (dT) 34 tract with poly(U), but not with poly(A). These findings strongly suggest that poly(dT) -containing template sequences interact and form a complex with its transcription products, possibly an RNA x DNA triplex, which blocks further transcription.
