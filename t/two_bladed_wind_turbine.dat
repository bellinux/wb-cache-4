X 120 ft. wind tunnel. A 3 D CFD-RANS approach is used, modeling single blade of the rotor utilizing periodicity, in a rotating frame of reference; over several upwind cases. All the simulations are performed using the commercial multi-purpose CFD solver ANSYS CFX 12. 1. The blade is modeled with simplified spherical hub excluding nacelle and tower, at stationary wind conditions neglecting wall shear effects due to tunnel blockage. The comparisons are {{done for the}} blade with 0 ° yaw angle and 3 ° tip pitch angle. Reasonably good agreement is obtained when comparing modeled mechanical effects Viz. power, thrust, and span wise force components with measurements over wind speeds ranging from 5 m/s to 25 m/s. The capability of CFD in predicting complex 3 D wind turbine aerodynamics is demonstrated in this paper with NREL Phase VI data campaign as a case study...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} {{improved}} concepts for horizontal axis wind turbines, the technical reliability {{and the economy}} of these machines can be improved. For the development of such concepts, the simulation of turbines by representative physical and/or numerical models is mandatory. For this purpose a computer controlled <b>two</b> <b>bladed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> with 16 m diameter and a numerical code for the simulation of the aeroelastic behaviour are available. The turbine was thoroughly overhauled and several components {{have been replaced by}} newly developed ones. The instrumentation was extended and improved and the total system was checked out in trial runs. The dynamic behaviour and the stressing of different rotor types were investigated both experimentally and numerically. Several control strategies (blade pitch, generator torque, yawing) were applied to the turbine and the responses monitored. In order to verify the numerical simulation software, measurements were compared with the results of several aero-elastic codes. Using the experimental wind turbine, different aerodynamic effects (stall, influence of ice and rain) were investigated. (orig.)

30|$|Wind turbine steel towers are {{vulnerable}} to aerodynamic loadings, and the identification of their actual dynamic properties is a crucial step in understanding its dynamic behavior. That is necessary to improve design guidelines and to predict the structural behavior under any expected future loading. A recent study conducted an experimental modal testing on full-scale wind turbine prototype model using a shaking table facility (Prowel et al. 2008). Their research presented the experimental results from an initial series of full-scale shake table tests of a 65  kW wind turbine with a 23  m hub height. Using the experimental results, a calibrated finite element model was developed to investigate and highlight the salient characteristics of the wind turbine’s seismic response. Their model was subjected {{to a number of}} earthquake records from California. Five high-intensity historical input motions, which produced significant response in the turbine, were used to investigate the difference in seismic demand of a parked turbine for uni-axial and bi-directional excitation scenarios. Molinari et al. (2010) described the results of AVT conducted on a <b>two</b> <b>bladed</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> tower. Its spectral response to wind excitation was identified both in operation and with the rotor at rest. The outcome of the experiment suggests that the vulnerability to fatigue of that model of turbine is very sensitive to its modal behavior, depending on the mechanical admittance of the foundations. Dai et al. (2013) conducted ambient vibration test using a laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) as a remote sensor. The tested wind turbine is a three-bladed turbine system. The supported tower is a 63  m-height tubular steel structure. The study investigated the efficiency of using a laser-based remote sensor to measure the dynamic properties of an existing wind turbine structure. The natural frequencies and damping ratios of the 1.5  MW wind turbine were identified. It is indicated that the tubular steel tower is flexible with low damping. Bazeos et al. (2002) and Lavassas et al. (2003) presented extensive finite element models for prototype turbines with power ratings of 450  kW and 1  MW, respectively. Both studies employed simple single-degree-of-freedom models with the rotor and nacelle mass lumped {{at the top of the}} tower. Prowell and Veers (2009) presented an insightful analysis of the literature describing various simplified and full-system wind turbine models that have been published and used for the seismic analysis of turbines.|$|E
