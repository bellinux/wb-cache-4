If the Universe were too dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the Universe contained too little matter then the expansion would accelerate too rapidly for planets and planetary systems to form. Since the Big Bang, the universe has expanded monotonically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our universe has just the right mass density of about 5 protons per cubic meter which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.|$|E

25|$|Melanin in {{the skin}} protects the body by {{absorbing}} solar radiation. In general, the more melanin <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skin the more solar radiation can be absorbed. Excessive solar radiation causes direct and indirect DNA damage to the skin and the body naturally combats and seeks {{to repair the damage}} and protect the skin by creating and releasing further melanin into the skin's cells. With the production of the melanin, the skin color darkens, but can also cause sunburn. The tanning process can also be created by artificial UV radiation.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the reason}} that {{positive}} science, according to Giddens, is never possible in the social sciences: every time an investigator tries to identify causal sequences of action, the actors can change their further line of action. The problem is, however, that conflicting viewpoints in social science result in a disinterest of the people. For example, when scientists don't agree about the greenhouse-effect, people will withdraw from that arena, and deny that there is a problem. Therefore, the more the sciences expand, the more uncertainty <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> modern society. In this regard, the juggernaut gets even more steerless.|$|E

25|$|Another, more abstract, {{notion of}} {{continuity}} is continuity of functions between topological spaces {{in which there}} generally is no formal notion of distance, as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of metric spaces. A topological space is a set X together with a topology on X, which {{is a set of}} subsets of X satisfying a few requirements with respect to their unions and intersections that generalize the properties of the open balls in metric spaces while still allowing to talk about the neighbourhoods of a given point. The elements of a topology are called open subsets of X (with respect to the topology).|$|E
25|$|Thus, by the {{criterion}} of harmony, Shaftesbury refutes Hobbes, and deduces the virtue of benevolence as indispensable to morality. So also he has drawn a close parallel between the moral and the aesthetic criteria. Just {{as there is a}} faculty which apprehends beauty in the sphere of art, so <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sphere of ethics a faculty which determines the value of actions. This faculty he described (for the first time in English thought) as the Moral Sense (see Hutcheson) or Conscience (cf. Butler). In its essence, it is primarily emotional and non-reflective; in process of development it becomes rationalized by education and use. The emotional and the rational elements in the moral sense Shaftesbury did not fully analyse (see Home).|$|E
25|$|Further {{practical}} aspects {{concern the}} amount of time the system can switch from channel to channel, time to lock when first switched on, and how much noise <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> output. All of these are a function of the loop filter of the system, which is a low-pass filter placed between the output of the frequency comparator and the input of the VCO. Usually the output of a frequency comparator {{is in the form of}} short error pulses, but the input of the VCO must be a smooth noise-free DC voltage. (Any noise on this signal naturally causes frequency modulation of the VCO.) Heavy filtering will make the VCO slow to respond to changes, causing drift and slow response time, but light filtering will produce noise and other problems with harmonics. Thus the design of the filter is critical to the performance of the system and in fact the main area that a designer will concentrate on when building a synthesizer system.|$|E

25|$|Much of the {{destruction}} of the rainforest has occurred through slash and burn farming, which allows for little to no fallow time and creates soil erosion. It also depletes what little nutrition <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil, which is then also polluted by the use of fertilizers and pesticides. As of {{the first decade of the}} 21st century, it is estimated about two thirds of the Lacandon outside the main biosphere reserve has been converted into pasture or cropland. Once this land has been cleared and used, it is very difficult to revert it to rainforest, even after it has been abandoned. Grass for pasture is particularly problematic because after it takes hold, does not allow natural vegetation to compete with it. In addition, the soil becomes compacted by the trampling of livestock. This degradation causes streams to dry up as evaporation rates rise from the lack of shade.|$|E
25|$|As {{constructed}} popularly {{through the}} Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, relativists {{believe that the}} structure of a particular language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or her world view. Universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human capacity for language, while relativists believe that this varies from language to language and person to person. While the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea expressed through the writings of American linguists Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, it was Sapir's student Harry Hoijer who termed it thus. The 20th century German linguist Leo Weisgerber also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity. Relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. The emergence of cognitive linguistics in the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity. Thinkers like George Lakoff have argued that language reflects different cultural metaphors, while the French philosopher of language Jacques Derrida's writings have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in linguistics, especially through deconstruction and was even heavily criticized in the media {{at the time of his}} death for his theory of relativism.|$|E

When the thought of her loyalty is eliminated, both her father and husband die because they have lost the hope of returning to her.

500|$|The Act {{extends the}} reach of implied {{conditions}} first {{laid out in the}} Sale of Goods Act 1893. Section 1 replaced Section 12 of the 1893 Act, containing 3 types of implied undertakings to title; a condition that the seller has the right to sell, or will when the property has passed to him, a warranty that the goods have no additional costs that the buyer has not been informed of, and a warranty of quiet possession. These provisions cannot be excluded, although if <b>there</b> <b>is,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original contract, a provision that the seller can only transfer what title he has, there is no condition that the seller has the right to sell. The Act also regulated sale by description, where products are sold based on a description given of them. Section 2 provides that [...] "a sale of goods shall not be prevented from being a sale by description by reason only that, being exposed for sale or hire, they are selected by the buyer". This is to ensure that a sale in a self-service store is considered sale by description, and that the sale is therefore covered by other provisions.|$|E
500|$|An early {{draft of}} the script {{attributed}} to Jones and Phillips is markedly different from the finished film. The early script has Jareth enter Sarah's house {{in the guise of}} Robin Zakar, the author of a play she is due to perform in. Sarah does not wish for her brother to be taken away by the goblins, and Jareth snatches him away against her will. Jareth is overtly villainous in this {{draft of the}} script, and during his final confrontation with Sarah he tells her he would [...] "much rather have a Queen" [...] than [...] "a little goblin prince." [...] The early script ends with Sarah kicking Jareth in disgust, her blows causing him to transform into a powerless, sniveling goblin. In the extensive junkyard scene, Jareth operates the Junk Lady as a puppet, whereas in the film she is autonomous. There is actually a pub or bar in the Labyrinth where the Man with Hat and Hoggle gather, and the river Lethe in Greek myth is mentioned. As well, the ballroom scene features extensive dialogue between Jareth and Sarah, whereas in the film there is none (although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novelization by A. C. H. Smith), and the goings-on with the dancers in the ballroom are more overtly sexualized.|$|E
