5|$|Roughly spherical eggs of {{different}} animals {{give rise to}} extremely different bodies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for bodybuilding proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that each group of animals would have its own rules of development. The surprise of evo-devo is that the shaping of bodies is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes, and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. The giraffe {{does not have a}} gene for a long neck, any more than the elephant has a gene for a big body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development {{of different}} features to begin earlier or later, to occur in <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> part of the embryo, and to continue for more or less time.|$|E

25|$|The theory {{sets out}} from the {{observation}} that primate vocal sounds are above all emotionally expressive. The emotions aroused are socially contagious. Because of this, an extended bout of screams, hoots or barks will tend to express not just the feelings of <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> individual but the mutually contagious {{ups and downs of}} everyone within earshot.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposed}} new branch of scientific exploration admits many {{different forms of}} scientific production. For instance, qualitative classifications are often the results of initial forays into the computational jungle. On the other hand, explicit proofs that certain systems compute <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> function are also admissible. There are also some forms of production that are in some ways unique to this field of study. For example, the discovery of computational mechanisms that emerge in different systems but in bizarrely different forms.|$|E
25|$|The {{court found}} {{evidence}} of an arms flow between Nicaragua and insurgents in El Salvador between 1979-81. However, {{there was not enough}} evidence to show that the Nicaraguan government was imputable for <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> the US response was proportional. The court also found that certain transborder incursions into the territory of Guatemala and Costa Rica, in 1982, 1983 and 1984, were imputable to the Government of Nicaragua. However, neither Guatemala nor Costa Rica had made any request for US intervention; El Salvador did in 1984, well after the US had intervened unilaterally.|$|E

25|$|If the Southern Maya Area {{is a part}} of Mesoamerica {{delineated}} {{from the}} rest of Mesoamerica spatially, temporally and, in one specific sense – by the still unresolved question of its possibly crucial role in the origins of Maya civilization - one needs to understand that posing this large research question risks falling into ultimately meaningless, infinitely regressing arguments about how “origins” might be considered or defined – essentially arguments about qualitative or inevitably subjectively rendered entities or topics, giving way to questions such as, What is “Maya civilization”? What is “Maya”? What is “civilization”? What allows us to call <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> civilization “great”? One way to conceptualize the quandary of seeking first cause/s is to understand that such an effort leads to infinite regression unless a metaconcept is accepted which, in the case of Maya civilization, is whatever it is primordially that made “Maya” “Maya.” Another way is to focus on ahistorical processes - environmental circumscription, peer polity interaction, and other theories.|$|E
25|$|The self {{is found}} to be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the {{volition}} of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. All that it could do would be to warrant a cause of some sort, but not <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would not allow us to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect—volition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or ground—in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.|$|E

"Known for {{his grasp}} of the Romantic organ and its literature, recitalist Thomas Murray {{surprisingly}} redirected his programming {{as well as his}} performance from a deeper personal expression to a statement of fine-tuning.

500|$|In {{his review}} for Salon magazine, Andrew O'Hehir wrote, [...] "What Soderbergh {{has sought to}} capture here is a grand process of birth and extinguishment, one that {{produced}} a complicated legacy in which John McCain, Barack Obama, and Raúl Castro are still enmeshed. There {{will be plenty of}} time to argue about the film's (or films') political relevance or lack thereof, to call Soderbergh names for <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> historical omission, for <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> ideological error.

When <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> part has been spoken of as contrived for some special purpose, it must not be supposed that it was originally always formed for this sole purpose. The regular course of events seems to be, that a part which originally served for one purpose, by slow changes becomes adapted for widely different purposes." ...|$|E

500|$|The intellectuals {{were stuck}} at a bypass; they {{recognized}} the government’s increasing normalization, {{but they were}} unsure whether to trust that the measures were only temporary or demand more. For example, still believing in Dubcek’s promises for reform, Milan Kundera published the article “Cesky udel” (Our Czech Destiny) in Literarni listy on 19 December. He wrote: [...] "People who today are falling into depression and defeatism, commenting {{that there are not}} enough guarantees, that everything could end badly, that we might again end up in a marasmus of censorship and trials, that <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> could happen, are simply weak people, who can live only in illusions of certainty." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's an {{illusion}} to believe himself {{active in the}} story.

[...] Physically, Perowne is neither above nor outside the fray but at an angle to it; emotionally his own intelligence makes him apathetic, he can see both sides of the argument, and his beliefs are characterised by a series of hard choices rather than sure certainties.|$|E
500|$|A more {{negative}} review came from Julia M. Klein of The Boston Globe, {{who found the}} book to be [...] "overly long and detailed, sometimes hard to follow, and without a real narrative payoff" [...] and felt that Fink's conclusions were presented more clearly in her original magazine article than in the book. Salon magazine's Laura Miller found {{the first half of}} the book lacking in [...] "shape or coherence, the meaning of <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> detail unclear and the timeline occasionally muddled", but was more impressed with the discussion of the disaster aftermath in the second half. NPR critic Susan Jane Gilman faulted the book for [...] "provok more debate than it answers" [...] but praised Fink's [...] "fair and balanced", [...] "nuanced" [...] writing.|$|E

5000|$|According to Hutchins, [...] "The {{tradition}} of the West is embodied in the Great Conversation {{that began in the}} dawn of history and that continues to the present day". Adler said, [...] "What binds the authors together in an intellectual community is the great conversation in which they are engaged. In the works that come later in the sequence of years, we find authors listening to what their predecessors have had to say about <b>this</b> idea <b>or</b> <b>that,</b> <b>this</b> topic <b>or</b> <b>that.</b> They not only harken to the thought of their predecessors, they also respond to it by commenting on it in a variety of ways." ...|$|R
500|$|A Fierce Bad Rabbit {{focuses on}} a {{traditional}} rather than a creative approach to storytelling and reflects Potter's inexperience with babies and very young children. [...] She {{appears to be more}} interested in naming and designating <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> rather than developing plot and exploring character. She names and directs the child's attention to the rabbit's tail, whiskers, and claws, for example, rather than to the animal's facial expression. When the hunter appears, he is blandly introduced with [...] "This is a man with a gun." [...] The gun goes off as expected with the stereotypical [...] "BANG!"

[...] On this topic, PewDiePie has claimed that it is disappointing when {{a large chunk of}} people misinterpret a component of his character; he states, [...] "if I mention on Twitter that I find <b>this</b> <b>or</b> <b>that</b> Kickstarter project cool, people immediately start to ask what economical interests I might have in it.

500|$|In Chinese, a numeral cannot usually {{quantify}} a noun by itself; instead, {{the language}} relies on classifiers, commonly {{also referred to}} as measure words.

Thus, while English speakers say [...] "one person" [...] or [...] "this person", Mandarin Chinese speakers say (yí [...] rén, one- person) or (zhè [...] rén, this- person), respectively [...] If a noun is preceded by both a demonstrative and a number, the demonstrative comes first.
