40|$|AIM: To compare <b>program</b> <b>costs</b> {{of chronic}} {{hepatitis}} B (CHB) screening and treatment using Australian and other published CHB treatment guidelines. METHODS: Economic modeling demonstrated that in Australia {{a strategy of}} hepatocellular cancer (HCC) prevention in patients with CHB is more cost-effective than current standard care, or HCC screening. Based upon this model, we developed the B positive program to optimize CHB management of Australians born in countries of high CHB prevalence. We estimated CHB <b>program</b> <b>costs</b> using the B positive program algorithm and compared them to estimated costs of using the CHB treatment guidelines published by the Asian-Pacific, American and European Associations for the Study of Liver Disease (APASL, AASLD, EASL) and those suggested by an independent United States hepatology panel. We used a Markov model that factored in the costs of CHB screening and treatment, individualized by viral load and alanine aminotransferase levels, and calculated the relative <b>costs</b> of <b>program</b> components. <b>Costs</b> were discounted by 5 % and calculated in Australian dollars (AUD). RESULTS: Using the B positive algorithm, <b>total</b> <b>program</b> <b>costs</b> amount to 13 &#x 2005; 979 &#x 2005; 224 AUD, or 9634 AUD per patient. The least costly strategy is based upon using the AASLD guidelines, which would cost 34 % less than our B positive algorithm. Using the EASL and the United States Expert Group guidelines would increase <b>program</b> <b>costs</b> by 46 %. The largest expenditure relates {{to the cost of}} drug treatment (66. 9 % of <b>total</b> <b>program</b> <b>costs).</b> The contribution of CHB surveillance (20. 2 %) and HCC screening and surveillance (6. 6 %) is small - and together they represent only approximately a quarter of the <b>total</b> <b>program</b> <b>costs.</b> CONCLUSION: The significant cost variations in CHB screening and treatment using different guidelines are relevant for clinicians and policy makers involved in designing population-based disease control programs...|$|R
