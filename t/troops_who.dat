5|$|The colonial {{government}} in the Congo depended on its military to maintain civil order and, above all, it depended on the loyalty of the native <b>troops</b> <b>who</b> made {{up the bulk of}} the Force Publique. Black non-commissioned Officers led by First Sergeant-Major Ngoie Mukalabushi, a veteran of the East Africa Campaign, munitied at Luluabourg in the central Congolese province of Kasaï in February 1944; the trigger for this was a plan to vaccinate <b>troops</b> <b>who</b> had served at the front, though the soldiers were also unhappy about the demands placed on them and their treatment by their white officers.|$|E
5|$|In 1736, {{during the}} War of the Polish Succession, Don Carlos was banished from Tuscany {{as part of}} a {{territorial}} swap, and Francis III of Lorraine was made heir in his stead.

5|$|The invading army entered Moldavia in December 1474.

5|$|U.S. Marines, {{under the}} overall command of U.S. Major General Alexander Vandegrift, {{captured}} {{the islands of}} Tulagi, Gavutu, and Tanambogo among which the Japanese Navy had constructed a naval and seaplane base.

5|$|According to {{the later}} Chronicle of Polish Dukes by Gallus, the battle {{occurred}} by accident: When Bolesław decided {{to throw a}} feast to boost his army's morale, Yaroslav's archers and scouts decided to create trouble for the Polish servants who were gutting the animals and preparing them near the river. However, they only annoyed them enough that the servants themselves crossed the relatively shallow river and chased away Yaroslav's surprised <b>troops,</b> <b>who</b> had been guarding the river. Bolesław learned of the skirmish sooner than Yaroslav, and managed to move most of his army across the river, defeating the surprised Yaroslav.|$|E
5|$|Although the Persians stood {{their ground}} for a while, they {{eventually}} broke and fled to the palisade. The soldiers of the right wing followed them into the camp, at which point many of the Persian army fled from the camp, except the ethnic Persian <b>troops,</b> <b>who</b> grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who entered the camp. Finally, the left wing arrived, outflanking the camp and falling on {{the rear of the}} remaining Persian forces, thereby completing the rout.|$|E
5|$|Another {{arm of the}} {{conspiracy}} was directed at the Indian <b>troops</b> <b>who</b> were serving in Middle East, while efforts were directed at drawing Afghanistan into the war {{on the side of}} the Central Powers, which it was hoped would incite a nationalist or pan-Islamic uprising in India and destabilise the British recruiting grounds in Punjab and across India. After Russia's defeat in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war, her influence had declined, and it was Afghanistan that was at the time seen by Britain as the only power in the sub-continent capable of directly threatening India.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} Household Cavalry, the {{officers}} of the Royals and Inniskillings found {{it very difficult to}} rein back their <b>troops,</b> <b>who</b> lost all cohesion. Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines. Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery.|$|E
5|$|Clashes in {{the capital}} between Habré's FAN and pro-Libyan groups became {{progressively}} more serious. On 22 March 1980, a minor incident, as in 1979, triggered the second battle of N'Djamena. In ten days, the clashes between the FAN and Goukouni's FAP, which both had 1,000–1,500 troops in the city, caused thousands of casualties and the flight of about half the capital's population. The few remaining French <b>troops,</b> <b>who</b> left on 4 May, proclaimed themselves neutral, as did the Zairean peace force.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes {{resolved}} to do this, taking {{the greater part}} of the army with him. Mardonius handpicked the <b>troops</b> <b>who</b> were to remain with him in Greece, taking the elite infantry units and cavalry, to complete the conquest of Greece. All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, however, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt city for the winter.|$|E

5|$|France's {{defeat in}} Indochina, {{coupled with the}} German {{destruction}} of her armies just 14 years earlier, seriously damaged its prestige elsewhere in its colonial empire, {{as well as with}} its NATO allies, most importantly, the United States. Within its empire, the defeat in Indochina served to spur independence movements in other colonies, notably the North African territories from which many of the <b>troops</b> <b>who</b> fought at Điện Biên Phủ had been recruited.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Magic Johnson {{and current}} and former NBA players such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Bill Russell, as well as Maya Moore from the WNBA, played a {{basketball}} game with President Barack Obama as an exhibition {{for a group of}} military <b>troops</b> <b>who</b> had been injured in action.

The basketball game was part of festivities organized to celebrate Obama's 49th birthday.|$|E
5|$|In June 1941, Nazi Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union. Unlike {{many of the}} border <b>troops</b> <b>who</b> were caught off guard by the offensive, Bagramyan and his commander, General Mikhail Kirponos, {{believed}} an invasion by Germany was inevitable. However, Kirponos chose to ignore Bagramyan's viewpoint that the German offensive would employ the lightning speed Blitzkrieg tactics like those seen in the campaigns in Poland in 1939 and Western Europe in 1940. Since the winter of 1939–40, Bagramyan had been busy devising a battle plan that would counter threats from the western Ukraine, which was approved after numerous revisions on 10 May 1940.|$|E

60|$|Again, I {{have known}} it practised in troops of horse, {{especially}} when it was so ordered that the troopers mounted themselves; where every private trooper has agreed to pay, perhaps, 2d. per diem out of his pay into a public stock, which stock was employed to remount any of the <b>troop</b> <b>who</b> by accident should lose his horse.|$|R
