25|$|The UK Food Standards Agency has {{recommended}} that pregnant women should limit their caffeine intake, out of prudence, {{to less than}} 200mg of caffeine a day– the equivalent of <b>two</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> instant coffee, or {{one and a half}} to <b>two</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> fresh coffee. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200mg per day in pregnant women. For women who breastfeed, are pregnant, or may become pregnant, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 300mg, or a little over two 8oz (237mL) cups of coffee.|$|E

25|$|Each {{participant}} {{receives an}} olive-sized portion of matzo {{to be eaten}} as afikoman. After the consumption of the afikoman, traditionally, no other food may be eaten {{for the rest of}} the night.

25|$|A {{diet that}} {{includes}} {{large amounts of}} carotene, fiber, and vitamins with low amounts of fat—specifically, a diet with non-starchy vegetables (e.g. broccoli and onions)—may be protective, though research is still ongoing in this area. Higher caffeine intake and consumption of more than <b>two</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> tea a day have both been associated with lower ovarian cancer risk. Smoking tobacco is protective for sex cord-stromal tumors.|$|E

25|$|In early 2007 Gold Coast Mayor Ron Clarke {{met with}} then-Australian Football League CEO Andrew Demetriou in a Broadbeach café {{to discuss the}} {{possibility}} of establishing a professional team on the Gold Coast. Demetriou was later quoted as saying it took <b>two</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> coffee before thinking {{it was a good}} idea. Following the meeting it was announced that the AFL had offered the North Melbourne Football Club a $100 million package to permanently relocate to the Gold Coast. With relocation looking likely, James Brayshaw began campaigning for the president position with the slogan 'Keep North at North'. On 7 December 2007 the newly appointed Kangaroos chairman James Brayshaw announced the club would not be moving to the Gold Coast and would continue to be based out of Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|Banquets (궁중 연회 음식) {{were held}} on special {{occasions}} in the Korean Royal Palace. These included birthdays {{of the royal family}} members, marriages, and national festivals, including Daeborum, Dano, Chuseok, and Dongji. Banquet food was served on individual tables which varied according to the rank of the person. Usually banquet food consisted of ten different types of dishes. Main dishes were prepared based on the seasonal foods. Main dishes of the banquet included sinseollo, jeon, hwayang jeok, honghapcho, nengmyun and mulgimchi. A typical banquet ingredient was chogyetang (chicken broth with vinegar), which was prepared with five different chickens, five abalones, ten sea cucumbers, twenty eggs, half a bellflower root, mushrooms, <b>two</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> black pepper, two peeled pine nuts, starch, soy sauce and vinegar. Yaksik was a favorite banquet dessert.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine {{can have}} both {{positive}} and negative health effects. It can treat and prevent the premature infant breathing disorders bronchopulmonary dysplasia of prematurity and apnea of prematurity. Caffeine citrate is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. It may confer a modest protective effect against some diseases, including Parkinson's disease. Some people experience insomnia or sleep disruption if they consume caffeine, especially during the evening hours, but others show little disturbance. Evidence of a risk during pregnancy is equivocal; some authorities recommend that pregnant women limit consumption to the equivalent of <b>two</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> coffee per day or less. Caffeine can produce a mild form of drug dependence– associated with withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness, headache, and irritability– when an individual stops using caffeine after repeated daily intake. Tolerance to the autonomic effects of increased blood pressure and heart rate, and increased urine output, develops with chronic use (i.e., these symptoms become less pronounced or do not occur following consistent use).|$|E

25|$|Caffeine {{can have}} {{multiple}} effects at the cellular level but is primarily notable for the alertness effect {{that it has}} on people. Research has been performed involving phonological priming and TOTs in which participants took either 200mg of caffeine or a placebo. The participants answered 100 general knowledge questions, each with one correct answer. For each question, participants read 10 priming words that were displayed on a monitor {{for a short period}} of time. Each list of 10 priming words had between two and eight words that were phonologically related to the correct answer of the question, with the remaining words being unrelated. Caffeinated participants had fewer TOT experiences than the placebo group, suggesting better memory recall. However, in the unrelated condition, the caffeinated group did not do as well as the placebo group in their ability to retrieve words. The results suggest that this dose of caffeine (equivalent to <b>two</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> coffee) can temporarily hinder a person’s short-term recall of certain words. Moreover, the general advantageous effect of caffeine on attention can be ruled out.|$|E
2500|$|A {{classic example}} of a single-blind test is the Pepsi Challenge. A tester, often a {{marketing}} person, prepares two sets of cups of cola labeled [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B". One set of cups is filled with Pepsi, while the other is filled with Coca-Cola. The tester knows which soda is in which cup but {{is not supposed to}} reveal that information to the subjects. Volunteer subjects are encouraged to try the <b>two</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> soda and polled for which ones they prefer. One of the problems with a single-blind test like this is that the tester can unintentionally give subconscious cues which influence the subjects. In addition, it is possible the tester could intentionally introduce bias by preparing the separate sodas differently (e.g., by putting more ice in one cup or by pushing one cup closer to the subject). If the tester is a marketing person employed by the company which is producing the challenge, there's always the possibility of a conflict of interest where the marketing person is aware that future income will be {{based on the results of}} the test.|$|E
