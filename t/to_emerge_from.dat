5|$|Bands <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> {{other major}} British cities {{included}} The Animals from Newcastle, Them from Belfast and the Spencer Davis Group and The Moody Blues from Birmingham. None of these bands played exclusively rhythm and blues, often relying on sources that included Brill Building and girl group songs for their hit singles, but it {{remained at the}} core of their early albums.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism at La Reforma began {{during the}} Pliocene, with ash flows and subaqueous pumice flows. Later {{activity}} became subaerial and generated pillow lava. Of the local volcanoes, La Reforma {{was the first}} <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the sea. Four to five million years ago, basaltic dykes formed. Volcanic activity at La Reforma occurred between 1.6 and 1.4 million years ago, and at least four ignimbrites have been found there.|$|E
5|$|After 400–500 {{accumulated}} degree-days above , adults begin <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> {{trees in}} late spring, and peak emergence occurs around 1000 degree-days. After emergence, adults feed {{for one week}} on ash leaves in the canopy before mating, but cause little defoliation in the process. Males hover around trees, locate females by visual cues, and drop directly onto the female to mate; mating can last 50 minutes, and females may mate with multiple males over their lifespan. A typical female can live around six weeks and lay approximately 40–70 eggs, but females that live longer can lay up to 200 eggs.|$|E

5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} {{view on the}} History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion {{as a vehicle for}} parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are actually an intentional and integral part of the work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the ancient world.|$|E
5|$|An {{impressed}} tutor {{suggested he}} should become an actor and, on Pryce's behalf, {{applied to the}} Royal Academy of Dramatic Art for an application form; Pryce was awarded a scholarship to RADA. When he joined Equity he used Jonathan Pryce as his stage name because Equity will only have one actor with any particular name on its books. While at RADA Pryce worked as a door-to-door salesman of velvet paintings. Pryce {{was part of a}} 'new wave' of actors <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the Academy. Others included Bruce Payne, Juliet Stevenson, Alan Rickman, Anton Lesser, Kenneth Branagh and Fiona Shaw.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{significant}} scientific research <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> Morgan's laboratory concerned the biochemistry of vitamins and the nutritional value of foods. She became best known for her work examining the effects of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) on adrenal gland function. In her early research work, Morgan analyzed processed foods and characterized their vitamin composition. She was the first to establish that a preservative, sulfur dioxide, protected vitamin C but damaged thiamine.|$|E

5|$|The only item of note <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> No Sirree! was Robert Benchley's contribution, The Treasurer's Report. Benchley's disjointed parody so delighted {{those in}} {{attendance}} that Irving Berlin hired Benchley in 1923 {{to deliver the}} Report as part of Berlin's Music Box Revue for $500 a week. In 1928, Report was later made into a short sound film in the Fox Movietone sound-on-film system by Fox Film Corporation.

5|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} {{is important}} in this species, despite its restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside or leave the nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before nuptial flight, fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates will climb up onto objects such as lighted fluorescent lamps and begin to fly {{after half an hour}} of endless running. When queens are looking for a host nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen and seize her; such behaviour suggests that workers actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to be smaller and depauperated when compared to other colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce alate offspring.|$|E
5|$|As the SS Panzer Corps began <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the city, {{they engaged}} Soviet units {{positioned}} directly {{southwest of the}} city, including the 17th NKVD Brigade, 19th Rifle Division and 25th Guards Rifle Division. Attempts by the Red Army to re-establish communication with {{the remnants of the}} 3rd Tank Army continued, although in vain. On 14–15 March these forces were given permission to withdraw to the northern Donets River. The Soviet 40th and 69th armies had been engaged since 13 March with the Großdeutschland Panzergrenadier Division, and had been split by the German drive. After the fall of Kharkov the Soviet defense of the Donets had collapsed, allowing Manstein's forces to drive to Belgorod on 17 March, and take it by the next day. However, weather and exhaustion forced Manstein's counterstroke to end soon thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Mason Wren (J. E. Freeman) {{is one of}} five {{scientists}} {{employed by}} the USM to clone the Alien Queen. After the Queen is extracted from Ripley, Wren conducts social experiments on Number 8 (whom he considers a predator). He discovers Call infiltrating Number 8's cell, and orders the mercenaries rounded up for execution. They overpower the infantry and take Wren hostage, forcing him to lead them to the Betty. During an Alien attack, Wren shoots Call and escapes from his captors. He confronts the crew of the Betty aboard the ship as Larry Purvis' Alien begins <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> his chest. Wren shoots Purvis, who overpowers him and pulls Wren's head to Purvis' chest. The chestburster erupts through Purvis' rib cage and Wren's skull, killing them both.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} why, in 1873, Alkan decided <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been {{associated}} with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who {{was at the end of}} 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.|$|E
5|$|Jelena {{was born}} in 1365 or 1366 as the third {{daughter}} of Princess Milica of Serbia and Lazar of Serbia. Her mother belonged to the Nemanjić dynasty, while her father was {{the founder of the}} Lazarević dynasty. He created Moravian Serbia, the largest and most powerful state <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the ruins of the Serbian Empire. Hence, Jelena {{was a member of the}} highest Serbian aristocracy. She {{was born in}} Prilepac and spent her childhood in Kruševac, where she lived until she married her first husband, Đurađ II Balšić, in 1386. She had one child with him, a son named Balša III who was born in 1387. Balša III had three children, a son whose name is not known and two daughters, Jelena and Teodora. His son died at a very young age in 1415. In 1424, Balša's daughter Jelena married Stjepan Vukčić Kosača and became the mother of Queen Catherine of Bosnia and Vladislav Hercegović.|$|E

5|$|London was {{instrumental}} in the development of punk music, with figures such as the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and Vivienne Westwood all based in the city. More recent artists <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the London music scene include George Michael's Wham!, Kate Bush, Seal, the Pet Shop Boys, Bananarama, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bush, the Spice Girls, Jamiroquai, Blur, McFly, The Prodigy, Gorillaz, Bloc Party, Mumford & Sons, Coldplay, Amy Winehouse, Adele, Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran, Paloma Faith, Ellie Goulding, One Direction and Florence and the Machine. London is also a centre for urban music. In particular the genres UK garage, drum and bass, dubstep and grime evolved in the city from the foreign genres of hip hop and reggae, alongside local drum and bass. Music station BBC Radio 1Xtra was set up to support the rise of local urban contemporary music both in London and {{in the rest of the}} United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|On February 29, 2000, Boeing {{launched}} its next-generation twinjet program, initially called 777-X, and began issuing offers to airlines. Development was slowed by an industry downturn {{during the early}} 2000s. The first model <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the program, the 777-300ER, was launched with an order for ten aircraft from Air France, along with additional commitments. On February 24, 2003, the -300ER made its first flight, and the FAA and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency, successor to the JAA) certified the model on March 16, 2004. The first delivery to Air France took place on April 29, 2004. The -300ER, which combined the -300's added capacity with the -200ER's range, became the top-selling 777 variant in the late 2000s, benefitting as airlines replaced comparable four-engine models with twinjets for their lower operating costs.|$|E
5|$|The CECAFA Cup is {{considered}} Africa's oldest football tournament, and involves teams from Central and Southern Africa. The matches in the 1973 tournament were played from 22 September 1973 until 29 September 1973. The tournament was originally the Gossage Cup, contested {{by the four}} nations of Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika (modern day Tanzania), and Zanzibar, running from 1929 until 1965. In 1967, this became the East and Central African Senior Challenge Cup, often shortened to simply the Challenge Cup, which was competed for five years, until 1971, before the CECAFA Cup was introduced in 1973. Ethiopia were the defending champions, having won the 2005 tournament in Rwanda, after finishing second in their group, and going on to beat Zanzibar and Rwanda in the final. The 2006 champions Sudan failed, however, <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the 2005 group stages.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} folk metal bands were Skyclad from England and Cruachan from Ireland. Skyclad's {{debut album}} The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth {{was released in}} 1991 and {{would be considered a}} thrash metal album with some folk influences, unlike Cruachan’s early work which embraced the folk element as a defining part of their sound. It was not until 1994 and 1995 that other early contributors in the genre began <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> different regions of Europe and beyond. Among these early groups, the German band Subway to Sally spearheaded a different regional variation that over time became known as medieval metal. Despite their contributions, folk metal remained little known with few representatives during the 1990s. It was not until the early 2000s when the genre exploded into prominence, particularly in Finland with the efforts of such groups as Finntroll, Ensiferum, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Moonsorrow.|$|E
5|$|The first beat 'em up was 1984's Kung-Fu Master, with 1986's Renegade {{introducing}} the urban settings and underworld revenge themes employed extensively by later games. The genre then saw {{a period of}} high popularity between the release of Double Dragon in 1987, which defined the two-player cooperative mode central to classic beat 'em ups, and 1991's Street Fighter II, which drew gamers towards one-on-one fighting games. Games such as Streets of Rage, Final Fight and Golden Axe are other classics <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> this period. The genre has been less popular since the emergence of 3D-based mass-market games, but still some beat 'em ups adapted the simple formula to utilize large-scale 3D environments.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling <b>to</b> <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots branch {{out of the side of}} this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E
