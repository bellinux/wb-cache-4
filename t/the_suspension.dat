40|$|Effect of D―sorbitol {{addition}} on {{rheological properties}} of aqueous alumina suspensions dispersed with poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) was investigated. The {{results showed that}} for <b>the</b> aqueous alumina <b>suspensions</b> with 30 vol%? 40 vol% solids loadings, small amount of D―sorbitol can significantly enhance the stability of alumina suspensions with PAA at pH= 9. 0. When {{the total amount of}} dispersant was 0. 5 wt% and the concentration of D―sorbitol was 20 %, <b>the</b> viscosity of <b>suspensions</b> was <b>the</b> lowest. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>suspensions</b> dispersed with binary dispersant were less sensitive to ionic strength than <b>the</b> <b>suspensions</b> containing just <b>the</b> PAA. The role of PAA and D―sorbitol in <b>the</b> alumina <b>suspensions</b> was characterized by FTIR spectroscope. Based on the rheology and FTIR measurements, a schematic model was established to depict the mechanism for the effect of D―sorbitol in the presence of PAA. D―Sorbitol was absorbed both on alumina surface and the absorbed PAA, leading to an enhanced steric hindrance thus resulting better stability of <b>the</b> <b>suspensions...</b>|$|R

40|$|After {{preparing}} aqueous suspensions from magnetite particles with a poly-acrylic acid, {{we investigated}} {{the effects of}} several experimental parameters. We characterized the stability of <b>the</b> <b>suspensions</b> using visual inspection, sedimentation, adsorption, and thermal stability of the dispersant.

The stability of <b>the</b> <b>suspensions</b> increased as <b>the</b> concentration of the dispersant and the temperature increased. In terms of the molecular weights of <b>the</b> dispersant, <b>the</b> <b>suspensions</b> with dispersant of low-molecular weight (1800) were more stable than those of high-molecular weight (250000) at room temperature. However, at high temperature <b>the</b> <b>suspensions</b> with high-molecular weight showed stability. The adsorption efficiency of the dispersant was very low. The dispersant of high-molecular weight showed a higher thermal integrity than that of low-molecular weight. From this work, we obtained the optimum conditions for stable aqueous suspensions of magnetite particles...|$|R
40|$|The {{rheological}} behavior of suspensions containing vacuum freeze dried and spray dried starch nanoparticles was investigated {{to explore the}} effect of these two drying methods in producing starch nanoparticles which were synthesized using high pressure homogenization and mini-emulsion cross-linking technique. Suspensions containing 10 % (w/w) spray dried and vacuum freeze dried nanoparticles were prepared. The continuous shear viscosity tests, temperature sweep tests, the frequency sweep and creep-recovery tests were carried out, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>suspensions</b> containing vacuum freeze dried nanoparticles showed higher apparent viscosity within shear rate range (0. 1 - 100 s(- 1)) and temperature range (25 - 90 degrees C). <b>The</b> <b>suspensions</b> containing vacuum freeze dried nanoparticles were found to have more shear thinning and less thixotropic behavior compared to those containing spray dried nanoparticles. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>suspensions</b> containing vacuum freeze dried particles had stronger elastic structure.

40|$|The extensional {{properties}} of micro fibrillated cellulose (MFC) -suspensions at different fibril concentrations and with different amounts of added sodium chloride were evaluated.

The extensional viscosity exhibited an extensional-thinning behaviour over the extensional strain rates used. Furthermore the extensional viscosity decreased with decreasing concentration of <b>the</b> <b>suspensions,</b> in similarities with the shear {{properties of}} the specimens. For <b>the</b> <b>suspensions</b> containing sodium chloride, the extensional viscosity appeared to increase when the concentration of sodium chloride was increased.
