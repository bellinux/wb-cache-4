The sodium channel blocking agents exhibited a rather preferential elevation of the threshold for thermal nociception. By contrast, morphine produced similar analgesic effects on thermal and mechanical nociception. In the sciatic nerve isolated from mice, mexiletine, lidocaine, eperisone, and <b>tolperisone</b> impaired the propagation of low frequency action potentials (evoked at 0. 2 Hz). Carbamazepine, phenytoin, and zonisamide generated a more frequency-dependent local anesthetic action with their obvious effects on higher frequency action potentials (evoked at 5 and/or 10 Hz).

40|$|The major drug {{binding site}} of sodium {{channels}} is inaccessible from the extracellular side, drug molecules can only access it {{either from the}} membrane phase, or from the intracellular aqueous phase. For this reason, ligand-membrane interactions are as important determinants of inhibitor properties, as ligand-protein interactions. One way to probe this is to modify the pH of the extracellular fluid, which alters the ratio of charged vs. uncharged forms of some compounds, thereby changing their interaction with the membrane. In this electrophysiology study we used three different pH values: 6. 0, 7. 3 and 8. 6 to test {{the significance of the}} protonation-deprotonation equilibrium in drug access and affinity. We investigated drugs of several different indications: carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, lidocaine, bupivacaine, mexiletine, flecainide, ranolazine, riluzole, memantine, ritanserin, <b>tolperisone,</b> silperisone, ambroxol, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, clozapine, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, maprotiline, nisoxetine, mianserin, mirtazapine, venlafaxine, nefazodone and trazodone.

As expected, we observed a strong correlation between the acidic dissociation constant (pKa) of drugs and the pH-dependence of their potency. Unexpectedly, however, the pH-dependence of reversibility or kinetics showed diverse patterns, not simple correlation. Our data are best explained by a model where drug molecules can be trapped in at least two chemically different environments: A hydrophilic trap (which may be the aqueous cavity within the inner vestibule), which favors polar and less lipophilic compounds, and a lipophilic trap (which may be the membrane phase itself, and/or lipophilic binding sites on the channel).

At the same time, the latter are used for combined therapy using nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)   in 53. 1 % of patients in an outpatient  setting. No clear recommendations make the administration of these agents uncontrolled, on the one hand, and substantially restrict therapeutic  possibilities, on the other. Objective: to investigate the short-term effect and safety of using <b>tolperisone</b> hydrochloride  (THC,  Mydocalm®)   in patients with AS during group therapeutic  exercise (TE). Subjects and methods. The investigation included 40 patients aged over 18 years with a valid diagnosis of AS who had been treated at the Clinic of the V. A. Nasonova Research Institute of Rheumatology and agreed to participate  in the study. All the patients were randomized  in a 1 : 1 ratio into two groups: 1) 20 patients used NSAIDs in combination with TE; 2) 20 patients received NSAIDs,  TE, and THC 450 mg/day. The groups were matched for age, gender, disease duration,  and functional impairments. Before and after completion  of the investigation, the investigators estimated BASDAI, BASFI, patient-rated numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), patient-rated TE performance  scores (NPRS, where 0 (very effective), 10 (ineffective), THC tolerance monitoring  (consideration of adverse events). Spinal motility was evaluated using BASMI and chest excursion measurement. Results and discussion. During TE, both groups showed {{a significant increase in the}} volume of movements (p < 0. 03), when measuring chest excursion and carrying out modified Schober's test, a decrease in BASDAI (p < 0. 01) and BASFI (p < 0. 009), as well as a reduction  in patient-rated overall disease activity assessment (p < 0. 02) as compared to the baseline values. At the same time the modified Schober test revealed that the increase in motility was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 (p < 0. 05). During the follow-up, the patient-rated evaluation of TE efficiency remained significantly unchanged  in Group 1 whereas at the end of the study it significantly increased in Group 2 as compared to the baseline values (p < 0. 01). There were no significant differences between the groups in the time course of changes in BASDAI and BASFI. When performing the BASMI tests, there was an intensive increment  in the volume of movements after the third TE lesson. The increment  occurred saltatorily in Group 1, but more rapidly and evenly in Group 2. No serious adverse events were recorded in Group 2 during the investigation. Conclusion.

40|$|Thirty {{patients}} with recurrent {{urinary tract infection}} or urinary incontinence were diagnosed as reflex neurogenic bladder including uninhibited neurogenic bladder or unstable bladder {{by a series of}} tests including urological routine tests, roentgenography (mainly, voiding cysto-urethrography), urodynamic and electrophysiologic examinations, urethral pressure profile, and endoscopic examinations, and by EEG and myelography for some cases. Some of them were treated with timepidium bromide, an anti-cholinergic agent, and the effects were evaluated by urodynamic examinations before and after the treatment. Other patients were subcutaneously injected with bethanecol chloride and 30 minutes later subjected to urodynamic examinations. Then, they were intramuscularly injected with timepidium bromide, and again subjected to urodynamic examination 30 minutes later. The latter trial was an attempt to make vesical and urethral smooth muscles more unstable and in these conditions to probe the efficacy of timepidium more clearly. The urodynamic examinations used in this series were Lewis' cystometrogram for the bladder filling phase and the voiding urodynamic examination (VUD) for the voiding phase with a 6 channel polygraph that simultaneously measured the vesical, urethral and intra-abdominal pressures, tonus and E M G of the anal sphincter, and urinary flow rate. The subjects studied consisted of 6 males and 24 females from the age 6 to 65 (22 children and 8 adults), and of 13 cases of unstable bladder and 17 cases of uninhibited neurogenic bladder. Timepidium bromide was very effective in 63 %, and only moderately effective in 20 % of the treated patients. The effects of the drug were evaluated on the three voiding parameters, i. e. the bladder volumes at the first desire to void, maximal desire to void and maximal vesical voiding pressure before and after administration of the drug, and analyzed by Student "t" test to give the following results; the first two parameters were greater with P P> 0. 001 after than before the treatment. This indicates that the vesical capacity increased and the voiding pressure decreased after the treatment with timepidium with high degrees of statistical significance. In other words, the lowered vesical capacity and the hypertonic condition in uninhibited neurogenic bladder were alleviated by the treatment with timepidium. Comparison of the urodynamic patterns on the 6 channel polygraph between pre- and post-administration measurements revealed a decrease or complete disappearance of the involuntary detrusor contractions during the filling phase after the drug treatment. It was worthy of note that the secondary spastic condition of the pelvic floor musculature due to the involuntary contractions of the detrusor decreased or nearly disappeared after the treatment. This latter aspect seemed to be the {{one of the most important}} actions in the mechanism for the prevention of recurrent urinary tract infection and enuresis. The urodynamic patterns during the voiding phase indicated that the treatment with timepidium diminished or eliminated the fluctuations of the vesical and the urethral pressures observed before and after the voiding phase. Improvement of dyssynergia between detrusor and external urethral sphincter was not clearly observed. In conclusion, the treatment with anti-cholinergic agents such as timepidium should constitute the standard therapy for uninhibited neurogenic bladder and unstable bladder, and such an agent may be indicated in combination with other drugs according to symptoms. For example, the use of timepidium with <b>tolperisone</b> hydrochloride or diazepam should be taken into consideration when the spasm of the pelvic floor musculature appears. Large doses of an anti-cholinergic agent may be necessary for the uninhibited neurogenic bladder as a sequel of cerebral infantile paralysis or other brain diseases. In these cases, combined medication with flavoxate or imipramine should be warranted...|$|E
