5|$|A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the Catholic Church in <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> <b>and</b> Its Unfulfilled Duty of Repair is a 2003 book by Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, {{previously}} {{the author}} or Hitler's Willing Executioners (1996). Goldhagen examines the Roman Catholic Church's role in <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust,</b> <b>and</b> offers {{a review of}} scholarship in English addressing what he argues is antisemitism {{throughout the history of}} the Church, which he claims contributed substantially to the persecution of the Jews during World War II.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Slayer {{released}} Divine Intervention, the band's {{first record}} with drummer Bostaph. The album featured songs about Reinhard Heydrich, an architect of <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust,</b> <b>and</b> Jeffrey Dahmer, an American serial killer and sex offender. Other themes included murder, {{the evils of}} church, and the lengths to which governments will go to wield power, Araya's interest in serial killers inspired much {{of the content of}} the lyrics.|$|E

5|$|Casualties were {{estimated}} to be between 2 and 3 million (about a quarter to one-third of the total population), while the Jewish population of Belarus was devastated during <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> <b>and</b> never recovered. The population of Belarus did not regain its pre-war level until 1971. It was also after this conflict that the final borders of Belarus were set by Stalin when parts of Belarusian territory {{were given to the}} recently annexed Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1992, on {{the fiftieth}} {{anniversary of the}} conference, the site was finally opened as a Holocaust {{memorial}} and museum known as the Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz (House of the Wannsee Conference). The museum also hosts permanent exhibits of texts and photographs that document events of <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> <b>and</b> its planning. The Joseph Wulf Bibliothek / Mediothek {{on the second floor}} houses a large collection of books on the Nazi era, plus other materials such as microfilms and original Nazi documents.|$|E
5|$|On a more {{historical}} note, the Jewish {{community has}} figured centrally {{in the history}} of Transylvania, and in that of the wider region. They were a substantial and increasingly vibrant presence in Cluj in the modern era, contributing significantly to the town's economic dynamism and cultural flourishing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Although the community comprised a significant share of the town's population during the interwar era—between 13 and 15 percent—this figure plummeted as a consequence of <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> <b>and</b> emigration; by the 1990s only a few hundred Jews remained in Cluj-Napoca.|$|E

5|$|Rudolf Vrba (11 September 1924– 27 March 2006) was a Slovak-Jewish {{biochemist}} who, as {{a teenager}} in 1942, was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-occupied Poland. He became known for having escaped from the camp in April 1944, at the height of <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust,</b> <b>and</b> for co-writing a detailed report about the mass murder that was taking place there. Distribution of the report is credited with having halted the mass deportation of Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz in July 1944, saving over 200,000 lives. After the war Vrba became a noted biochemist in England and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the passing}} of the Holocaust denial law in 1995, it is illegal to deny or attempt to justify the Holocaust. The act follows the Belgian Anti-Racism Law, passed in 1981, which led to the {{establishment}} of the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism, which researches racism and anti-Semitism in Belgium as well as aiding victims of discrimination. Breendonk and Dossin Barracks (at the site of the former Mechelen transit camp) are preserved as museums to <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> <b>and</b> to German repression in Belgium during the occupation.|$|E

With remnants of <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> <b>and</b> artifacts relevant to Judaism, the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art of Tulsa preserves the largest collection of Jewish art in the Southwest United States.|$|E

5|$|With the {{repatriation}} of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union and the 1947 Operation Vistula dispersing the remaining Ukrainian minority, and {{with most of}} the former Jewish minority exterminated by Nazi Germany during <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> <b>and</b> many of the survivors emigrating to the West and to newly created Israel, Poland for the first time became an ethnically homogeneous nation state. The government-imposed and spontaneous movements of people amounted to one of the greatest demographic upheavals in European history.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the German invasion, the {{population}} of Jews {{was estimated to be}} about210,000, although according to data from the Lithuanian statistics department, as of 1 January 1941 there were 208,000 Jews. This estimate, based on the officially accounted for prewar emigration within the USSR (approx.8,500), the number of escapees from Kaunas and Vilnius Ghettos, (1,500-2,000), as well as the number of the survivors in the concentration camps when they were liberated by the Red Army, (2,000-3,000), puts the number of Lithuanian Jews murdered in the Holocaust at195,000to196,000. It is difficult to estimate the exact number of casualties of <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> <b>and</b> the latter number cannot be final or indisputable. The numbers given by historians differ significantly ranging from 165,000to254,000, the higher number probably including non-Lithuanian Jews among other Reich (empirical) dissenters labeled as Jewish killed in Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|Ursula Maria Martius {{was born}} in Munich, Germany on September 16, 1921. Her mother was Jewish and an art {{historian}} and her father, an ethnographer, came from an old German Protestant family. Because of the Nazi persecution of the Jews, her parents tried to send their only child to school in Britain when World War II broke out, but the British refused to issue a student visa to anyone under 18. Ursula studied chemistry and physics at Berlin University until she was expelled by the Nazis. Her parents were interned in concentration camps while Franklin herself {{was sent to a}} forced labour camp. The family survived <b>The</b> <b>Holocaust</b> <b>and</b> was reunited in Berlin after the war.|$|E
5|$|On 3 May 1957, a {{group of}} citizens, {{including}} Otto Frank, established the Anne Frank Stichting {{in an effort to}} rescue the Prinsengracht building from demolition and to make it accessible to the public. The Anne Frank House opened on 3 May 1960. It consists of the Opekta warehouse and offices and the , all unfurnished so that visitors can walk freely through the rooms. Some personal relics of the former occupants remain, such as movie star photographs glued by Anne to a wall, a section of wallpaper on which Otto Frank marked the height of his growing daughters, and a map on the wall where he recorded the advance of the Allied Forces, all now protected behind Perspex sheets. From the small room which was once home to Peter van Pels, a walkway connects the building to its neighbours, also purchased by the Foundation. These other buildings are used to house the diary, as well as rotating exhibits that chronicle aspects of <b>the</b> <b>Holocaust</b> <b>and</b> more contemporary examinations of racial intolerance around the world. One of Amsterdam's main tourist attractions, it received a record 965,000 visitors in 2005. The House provides information via the internet and offers exhibitions that in 2005 travelled to 32 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, and South America.|$|E
