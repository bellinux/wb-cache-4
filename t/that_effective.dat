5|$|Apple {{began taking}} pre-orders for the first-generation iPad on March 12, 2010. The only major {{change to the}} device between its {{announcement}} and being available to pre-order was the change {{of the behavior of}} the side switch to perform either sound muting or screen rotation locking (user selectable). The Wi-Fi version of the iPad went on sale in the United States on April 3, 2010. The Wi-Fi+3G version was released on April 30. 3G service in the United States is provided by AT and was initially sold with two prepaid contract-free data plan options: one for unlimited data and the other for 250MB per month at half the price. On June 2, 2010, AT announced <b>that</b> <b>effective</b> June 7 the unlimited plan would be replaced for new customers with a 2GB plan at slightly lower cost; existing customers would have the option to keep the unlimited plan. The plans are activated on the iPad itself and can be cancelled at any time.|$|E
5|$|The NWA World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships were contested for in TNA {{until the}} morning of May 13, 2007. On that day, NWA's Executive Director Robert Trobich {{announced}} that the NWA were ending their five-year agreement with TNA, which had allowed them full control over both titles. Trobich went on to state <b>that</b> <b>effective</b> that morning, then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Christian Cage and then-NWA World Tag Team Champions Team 3D were stripped of their respective championships. The alleged motivation behind these actions was because Cage refused to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against wrestlers from NWA territories. That same day, TNA were scheduled to produce their Sacrifice event, in which both Cage and Team 3D were to defend their respective championships. On the card, Cage was scheduled to defend the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Kurt Angle and Sting in a match involving three competitors, {{also known as a}} three-way match.|$|E
5|$|Watts was {{recruited}} by the Melbourne Football Club with the first overall selection in the 2008 national draft. Drafted at seventeen years of age, {{he was in the}} last draft where a player could be recruited at seventeen, with the AFL requiring <b>that,</b> <b>effective</b> from the 2009 AFL draft, a player must turn at least eighteen years of age in the year they are drafted. The hype placed on him by the club was high when he was presented with the number four guernsey by six-time Melbourne premiership player, Ron Barassi—a guernsey number previously worn by club legend and the winner of ten premierships with the club as a player and coach, Norm Smith—in a ceremony at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) two days after being drafted. Completing year twelve in 2009, the need to manage school with football saw the club electing to not play him in pre-season matches during the NAB Cup.|$|E

25|$|A {{theory is}} {{consistent}} {{if it is}} not possible to prove a contradiction from the axioms of the theory.

25|$|Global brain theorists {{reply that}} the {{emergence}} of distributed intelligence {{would lead to the}} exact opposite of this vision.

Moreover, a more distributed form of decision-making would decrease the power of governments, corporations or political leaders, thus increasing democratic participation and reducing the dangers of totalitarian control.|$|E

25|$|West Indies were 252-8 {{at the end}} of {{the first}} day, after Australia won the toss and asked them to bat. Though all of the {{dismissed}} batsmen reached double figures, none could go on to make a substantial score. The best partnership was between Sobers and Lashley, who took the score from 107-4 to 200-5, after which three more wickets fell fairly quickly.

25|$|The general {{effectiveness}} of psychotherapy and psychological intervention is partly {{explained by the}} theory of cognitive dissonance. In that vein, social psychology proposed that {{the mental health of}} the patient is positively influenced by his and her action in freely choosing a specific therapy and in exerting the required, therapeutic effort to overcome cognitive dissonance. <b>That</b> <b>effective</b> phenomenon was indicated in {{the results of the study}} Effects of Choice on Behavioral Treatment of Overweight Children (1983), wherein the children's belief that they freely chose the type of therapy received, resulted in each overweight child losing a greater amount of excessive body weight.|$|E
25|$|About {{the same}} time, {{investigators}} from the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center conducted interviews and distributed questionnaires in organizations and collected measures of group productivity to assess effective leadership behaviors.

The University of Michigan investigators, however, termed these leadership behaviors relation-oriented behavior and task-oriented behavior. This line of research was later extended by Robert Blake and Jane Mouton in 1964 to suggest <b>that</b> <b>effective</b> leaders score high on both these behaviors.|$|E
25|$|According to Huntington {{and early}} studies of civil-military relationships, it is {{considered}} <b>that</b> <b>effective</b> civil- military relations {{should be in the}} form of objective civilian control over their armed forces. This control is indicated by the following factors; (1) the military's adoption of professional ethos and their recognition of boundaries of professional roles, (2) effective subordination of the military to civilian political leadership that formulates strategic directives on foreign and military policies, (3) recognition and approval from political leaders to the professional authorities and autonomy of the military and (4) minimal intervention of the military in politics and of politicians in military affairs.|$|E
