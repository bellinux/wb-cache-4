5|$|EFS {{has mostly}} a repressive role of EFS on {{processes}} {{associated with the}} activation of mature T-cells, including IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and IL-2-dependent clonal expansion of T cells. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, EFS dephosphorylation and release of the SRC family kinase FYN and phospholipase C-γ normally lead to self-limitation of the immune response. Consistent with this mechanism, EFS overexpression in T cell-derived cell lines decreased IL-2 concentration in supernatants in response to TCR stimulation, while T cells derived from mice lacking EFS gene showed increased IL-2 production. A dual role of EFS in mature T cells function has been proposed because both overexpression and siRNA knockdown of this protein in cell models resulted in decreased <b>transcriptional</b> <b>activation</b> of IL-2 dependent promoters following TCR stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Eukaryotic cells {{exposed to}} DNA {{damaging}} agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, protein trafficking and degradation. Such genome wide transcriptional response is very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global response to damage. Exposure of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental shock response {{indicates that a}} general global stress response pathway exist {{at the level of}} <b>transcriptional</b> <b>activation.</b> In contrast, different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the heterogeneity of mammalian cells. In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage.|$|E

25|$|Nucleosomes are {{portions}} of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) that are wrapped around protein complexes called histone cores. These histone cores {{are composed of}} 8 subunits, two each of H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 histones. This protein complex forms a cylindrical shape that dsDNA wraps around with approximately 147 base pairs. Nucleosomes are formed as a beginning step for DNA compaction that also contributes to structural support as well as serves functional roles. These functional roles are contributed by the tails of the histone subunits. The histone tails insert themselves in the minor grooves of the DNA and extend through the double helix, which leaves them open for modifications involved in <b>transcriptional</b> <b>activation.</b> Acetylation has been closely associated with increases in <b>transcriptional</b> <b>activation</b> while deacetylation has been linked with transcriptional deactivation.

40|$|Cooperative <b>transcriptional</b> <b>activations</b> among {{multiple}} transcription factors (TFs) {{are important}} to understand the mechanisms of complex transcriptional regulations in eukaryotes. Previous studies have attempted to find cooperative TFs based on gene expression data with gene expression profiles as a measure of similarity of gene regulations. In this paper, we use protein–protein interaction data to infer synergistic binding of cooperative TFs. Our fundamental idea {{is based on the assumption}} that genes contributing to a similar biological process are regulated under the same control mechanism. First, the protein–protein interaction networks are used to calculate the similarity of biological processes among genes. Second, we integrate this similarity and the chromatin immuno-precipitation data to identify cooperative TFs. Our computational experiments in yeast show that predictions made by our method have successfully identified eight pairs of cooperative TFs that have literature evidences but could not be identified by the previous method. Further, 12 new possible pairs have been inferred and we have examined the biological relevances for them. However, since a typical problem using protein–protein interaction data is that many false-positive data are contained, we propose a method combining various biological data to increase the prediction accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Primary {{cultures}} and tissue samples of chicken embryonic muscle were immunologically probed for {{the expression of}} muscle-specific proteins, such as myosin heavy chain and the tropomyosins, {{as well as for the}} nuclear lamina protein, lamin A. As determined by quantitative immunoblotting, the expression of lamin A and the muscle-specific proteins were at low levels or absent in predifferentiation myoblasts both in vitro and in ovo. During differentiation, an increase of lamin A expression preceded the induction to high levels of expression of muscle-specific proteins. Immunofluorescence staining of chicken em-bryonic muscle cells in culture also indicates an accumulation of lamin A before the induction of muscle-specific proteins expression. Furthermore, the accumulation of lamin A reached a plateau before the muscle-specific proteins during muscle development. In two dimensional NEPHGE gel analysis of immunoprecipitated lamin A, no detectable change in the ratio of the acidic/basic isoelectric variants of lamin A was observed during myogenesis. A potential role for lamin A in the mechanisms which underlie the differential and coordinate expression of musclespecific genes is proposed. T hE transition of embryonic myoblasts to multinucleated myotubes is marked by the withdrawal of myoblasts from the cell cycle, and is accompanied by considerable changes in the expression of muscle-specific contractile proteins (Nadal-Ginard, 1978; Coleman and Coleman, 1968).

40|$|We {{describe}} {{features of}} the regulation of a neural-specific gene, SCG 10, which is induced by nerve growth factor (NGF) during the neuronal differentiation of the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC 12. Induction of SCG 10 mRNA occurs within 12 – 24 hr of exposure to NGF, is sustained in the continued presence of the neurotrophic factor, and involves a mechanism that is, at least in part, transcriptional. Unlike the rapid, transient <b>transcriptional</b> <b>activations</b> of genes such as c-fos, SCG 10 induction requires ongoing protein synthesis, suggesting the participation of a de novo synthesized regulatory protein in mediating the effects of NGF on this gene. Although c-fos itself may play this role, its induction is clearly insufficient to cause an induction of SCG 10. NGF, FGF, and, to a lesser extent, phorbol esters induced SCG 10, whereas EGF and dibutyryl cAMP did not. In these characteristics, SCG 10 induction appears to constitute a reliable molecular index of the transcription-dependent neuronal differentiation induced by NGF. Glucocorticoids, which inhibit NGF-induced neurite outgrowth from normal primary chromaffin cells, partially blocked SCG 10 induction in PC 12 cells. A reciprocal pattern of regulation by NGF and glucocorticoids was observed for tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA. These data suggest that environmental signals such as NGF may act on specific genes, both positively and negatively, to control the choice of alternative fates by developing neural crest cells...|$|R
25|$|The bromodomain is a motif that is {{responsible}} for acetylated lysine recognition on histones by nucleosome remodelling proteins. Posttranslational modifications of N- and C-terminal histone tails attracts various transcription initiation factors that contain bromodomains, including human transcriptional coactivator PCAF, TAF1, GCN5 and CREB-binding protein(CBP), to the promoter and have a significance in regulating gene expression. Structural analysis of transcription factors has shown that highly conserved bromodomains are essential for protein to bind to acetylated lysine.This suggests that specific histone site acetylation has a regulatory role in gene <b>transcriptional</b> <b>activation.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{idea that}} {{modifications}} act as docking modules for related factors is {{borne out by}} histone methylation as well. Methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 has long been associated with constitutively transcriptionally silent chromatin (constitutive heterochromatin). It has been determined that a chromodomain (a domain that specifically binds methyl-lysine) in the transcriptionally repressive protein HP1 recruits HP1 to K9 methylated regions. One example that seems to refute this biophysical model for methylation is that tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 is strongly associated with (and required for full) <b>transcriptional</b> <b>activation.</b> Tri-methylation in this case would introduce a fixed positive charge on the tail.|$|E

Another is ATF-2 which contains a <b>transcriptional</b> <b>activation</b> (ACT) domain and a basic zipper DNA-binding (bZip) domain with a HAT domain in-between.

25|$|Another {{implication}} of histone acetylation {{is to provide}} a platform for protein binding.
