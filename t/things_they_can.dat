5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women use this as a method of increasing the number of <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> accomplish in a day.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there were}} many critics of the character, {{favorable}} comments came from several quarters. Columnist Erma Bombeck wrote, [...] "Kids {{need to know that}} somewhere in this world is a contemporary who can pull off all the <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only fantasize about, someone who can stick it to their parents once in a while and still be permitted to live." [...] In 2003, Bart placed first in a poll of parents in the United Kingdom who were asked [...] "which made-up character had the most influence" [...] on children under 12 years old.|$|E
500|$|Human {{rights are}} rights {{taken to be}} universal, of {{considerable}} importance, and relate to the individual and not collectively; among other <b>things,</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> grant freedoms, claims, immunities and powers. The European Convention on Human Rights was drawn up {{in the wake of}} the Second World War to uphold such rights. The United Kingdom ratified the European Convention on Human Rights in 1951, and accepted the right of individual petition to the European Court of Human Rights, Strasbourg, in 1966. The Human Rights Act 1998 made most Convention rights directly enforceable in a British court for the first time. Excluded are Articles 1 and 13, which the government argued were fulfilled by the Act itself, and therefore were not relevant to rights enforced under it. The Human Rights Act has had a considerable effect on British law, and remains an Act of [...] "fundamental constitutional importance".|$|E

2500|$|Glover {{appeared}} on Late Night with David Letterman on July 28, 1987, to promote River's Edge. Unbeknownst to David Letterman and the audience, Glover appeared in character as [...] "Rubin" [...] from the then-unreleased film Rubin and Ed, wearing platform {{shoes and a}} wig. Rather than a conventional interview, Glover staged an Andy Kaufman-like prank. After being goaded by {{a woman in the}} audience (who some argue had been planted), Glover stated he [...] "knew that this was gonna happen" [...] and [...] "the press, they can do <b>things,</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> twist things around." [...] After challenging Letterman to an arm-wrestling match, Glover delivered an impromptu karate kick a few feet from Letterman while stating, [...] "I'm strong... I can kick!" [...] Letterman then abruptly ended the segment by walking off stage, saying, [...] "I'm going to check on the Top 10," [...] as the program cut to commercial.|$|E

60|$|LORD GORING. My dear Robert, it’s a very awkward business, very awkward indeed. You {{should have}} told your wife the whole thing. Secrets from other people’s wives are a {{necessary}} luxury in modern life. So, at least, I am always told at the club {{by people who are}} bald enough to know better.

60|$|Value, however, being purely relative, can {{not depend}} upon {{absolute}} profits, {{no more than}} upon absolute wages, but upon relative profits only.

In so far as profits enter into the cost of production of all <b>things,</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> not affect the value of any. It is only by entering in a greater degree into the cost of production of some things than of others, {{that they can have}} any influence on value.|$|E

And we shall ask the pair to come to our house to do whatever <b>things</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> do. Meantime, if you thought well of it, you might write her and arrange a meeting, telling her it is by my suggestion and that I gave you her address.|$|E

60|$|Even {{more than}} what they eat I like their {{intellectual}} grasp. It is wonderful. Just watch them read. They simply read all the time.

You'd think that a man who'd been driving hard in the office from eleven o'clock until three, with only {{an hour and a half}} for lunch, would be too fagged. Not a bit.

"It {{would seem}} so to us, Boduoc, for {{we have had}} nothing else to employ our thoughts; but {{when we look at}} what the Romans have done, how great an empire they have formed, how {{wonderful}} are their arts, how good their laws, and what learning and wisdom they have stored up, one sees that there are other things to live for; and you see, though the Romans have learned all these <b>things,</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> still fight. If they once turn so much to the arts of peace as to forget the virtues of war, their empire will fall to pieces more rapidly than it has been built up." ...|$|E
60|$|What is the {{interpretation}} of it? Why does the great wind stir the deep waters? It does but ripple the shallow pool as it passes, for shallowness can but ripple and throw up shadows. We cannot tell, but this we know--that deep things only can be deeply moved. It is the penalty of depth and greatness; it is the price they pay for the divine privilege of suffering and sympathy. The shallow pools, the looking-glasses of our little life, know nought, feel nought. Poor <b>things!</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> but ripple and reflect. But the deep sea, in its torture, may perchance catch some echo of God's voice sounding down the driven gale; and, as it lifts itself and tosses its waves in agony, may perceive a glow, flowing from a celestial sky that is set beyond the horizon that bounds its being.|$|E

5000|$|The natural {{reaction}} {{of a parent}} hearing {{that the child is}} deaf is to stop talking to the baby, and that's the very worst <b>thing</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> do.
