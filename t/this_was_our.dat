500|$|By 4:00 in {{the morning}} the streets had nearly been cleared. Many people sat on stoops or {{gathered}} nearby in Christopher Park throughout the morning, dazed in disbelief at what had transpired. Many witnesses remembered the surreal and eerie quiet that descended upon Christopher Street, though there continued to be [...] "electricity in the air". One commented: [...] "There was a certain beauty {{in the aftermath of the}} riot... It was obvious, at least to me, that a lot of people really were gay and, you know, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> street." [...] Thirteen people had been arrested. Some in the crowd were hospitalized, and four police officers were injured. Almost everything in the Stonewall Inn was broken. Inspector Pine had intended to close and dismantle the Stonewall Inn that night. Pay phones, toilets, mirrors, jukeboxes, and cigarette machines were all smashed, possibly in the riot and possibly by the police.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2000, Stevens was offered the {{opportunity}} to volunteer in the Butler basketball office. He ran the idea of quitting his job at Eli Lilly by then-longtime girlfriend Tracy Wilhelmy. She {{thought about it for}} two hours before telling him to go for it. [...] "Now, it looks like a great idea," [...] Stevens later remarked. [...] "At the time, I thought it was something I really wanted to try." [...] Tracy went back to school to get a law degree that could support the couple if things did not work out for Brad. [...] "We were 23 and realized <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> chance," [...] Tracy later said. [...] "Five years down the road, we were probably {{not going to be in}} a position to do that. The more success you had at Lilly, the harder it would be to leave." ...|$|E

500|$|Three years later, in September 2014, Carol D. Leonnig from The Washington Post {{released}} an investigative report describing {{the details of}} the Secret Service's [...] "bungled" [...] response following the shooting. The Secret Service responded to the criticism, stating that the shots were fired from a quarter-mile away, resulting in echoes obfuscating their origin, and that initial witness accounts stated that the shots were fired at another vehicle from a black vehicle. An agent who asked to remain anonymous stated, [...] "I'm not saying <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> shining moment, but we never stopped looking for [...]" [...] A former agent stated that the Secret Service needed to change its ways in order to prevent [...] "complacency" [...] and stop future attacks. As {{a direct result of the}} attack, additional security measures, such as personnel changes and physical improvements including additional surveillance cameras, were implemented at the White House. It was the first shooting at the White House since Francisco Martin Duran's fired shots at President Bill Clinton from the fence overlooking the north lawn on October 29, 1994.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the record, David Bowie praised the band, writing, [...] " [...] might be all shamrocks and deutsche marks to some, but I feel that they {{are one of the few}} rock bands even {{attempting}} to hint at a world which will continue past the next great wall—the year 2000." [...] Although the record was a success, in the years following its release, the group have regarded it with mixed feelings and rarely play its material in live performances. Bono said, [...] "I thought of Zooropa at the time as a work of genius. I really thought our pop discipline was matching our experimentation and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> Sgt. Pepper. I was a little wrong about that. The truth is our pop disciplines were letting us down. We didn't create hits. We didn't quite deliver the songs. And what would Sgt. Pepper be without the pop songs?" [...] The Edge said that he did not think the songs were [...] "potent", further stating, [...] "I never thought of Zooropa as anything more than an interlude... but a great one, as interludes go. By far our most interesting." [...] Clayton said, [...] "It's an odd record and a favourite of mine." ...|$|E
500|$|In early August 2009, a {{call was}} {{received}} from Square Enix {{telling them that}} no payments were coming. Grin's founders considered suing, but {{had run out of}} money, leading them to stop production after six months of work. Furthermore, Grin ceased production on all of their other projects and declared bankruptcy due to Sweden's severe laws against operating businesses under a debt load. Magnus Ihrefors, one of the 3D artists who worked on the project, stated that he had only found out about the game's cancellation in August, but it was like a [...] "punch in the belly; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> last chance to get on track again." [...] The developer closed its offices on August 12, 2009, stating that delayed payments from [...] "too many publishers" [...] caused [...] "an unbearable cashflow situation," [...] and referred to Fortress in a farewell note as an [...] "unreleased masterpiece that [...] weren't allowed to finish." [...] According to the bankruptcy papers, Square Enix felt that the development goals for Fortress [...] "had not been met in a satisfactory way," [...] whereas Andersson claimed the contrary, arguing that the milestones initially set up with a producer from Square Enix had been met. Mraz stated that Grin seemed to have ignored Square Enix's requests for changes, and the Final Fantasy franchise was too important to overlook this behavior.|$|E

2500|$|Given {{that the}} band's {{background}} was exclusively in heavy music at that point, some band members experienced difficulties expanding their sound early on. In particular, Spruance noted that Mike Patton {{had to teach}} him to play the ska stroke for a performance at their high school talent show. Spruance later explained, [...] "Oh, what I remember was... <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> first... like, we had only done, uh, death metal up to that point. And so <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>our</b> first time trying to ever play ska. And I'd never played... on guitar, like, I'd never played... I didn't {{know how to do}} that skanking guitar shit at all. But Patton could do, like with one finger on the thread mark, he could do the, the rhythmic part of it pretty well. Like, he could... he taught me how to do it. So, I just sort of awkwardly... I would fill in and make the chord and he actually played guitar, but would just kind of use it percussively. And we played these Camper Van Beethoven songs, and I don't... I dunno if we played The Specials, but that's what we were listening to." ...|$|E
