5|$|In 2014, he co-starred in {{the film}} Aloft, with Jennifer Connelly, and Wally Pfister's <b>Transcendence,</b> which also starred Johnny Depp and Rebecca Hall. Murphy also reunited with Enda Walsh for the play Ballyturk in 2014. He starred in Ron Howard's 2015 film, In the Heart of the Sea, which also {{features}} Benjamin Walker and Chris Hemsworth.|$|E
5|$|After the 1920s, {{however, the}} church no longer {{required}} affirmation of these beliefs, allowing toleration for alternative {{interpretations of the}} Confession. By the 1940s, the dominance of liberal theology {{had given way to}} a neo-orthodox consensus within PCUSA seminaries, and this consensus would be maintained up to the 1958 merger. As a reaction against liberalism, neo-orthodoxy was characterized by an emphasis on divine <b>transcendence</b> rather than divine immanence, renewed affirmation of total depravity, and resistance to secularism and cultural accommodation within the church.|$|E
5|$|Freeman played Lucius Fox in a trilogy of Batman films: Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), and The Dark Knight Rises (2012). During that time, Freeman also {{appeared}} in The Bucket List (2007) opposite Jack Nicholson, Wanted (2008) with Angelina Jolie, and Invictus (2009) with Matt Damon. In 2011, Freeman received the AFI Life Achievement Award from the American Film Institute. Two years later he starred in action thriller Olympus Has Fallen (2013), science fiction film Oblivion (2013), caper Now You See Me (2013), and comedy Last Vegas. In 2014, Freeman appeared in the science fiction films <b>Transcendence</b> and Lucy.|$|E
5|$|The {{foundation}} of Celestial Master {{belief is that}} there is an energy source known as qi, that is born from the Dao and is the source of life all things. The human body contains spirits that need to be nourished by the proper balance of qi. There are three types of qi: yin qi, yang qi and blended qi, which is mixed yin/yang qi. The goal of a Daoist is to achieve <b>transcendence</b> to a higher plane. In order to do this, they must preserve and harmonize their internal spirits. Only through meditation that guides qi correctly throughout the body, can the spirits be harmonized correctly. While it is known that the Celestial Masters meditated in order to obtain qi, there is no surviving evidence that describes their meditation practices.|$|E
5|$|First Strike {{takes place}} in the 26th century, where humanity, under the {{governance}} of the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), has been fighting a losing war against a religious collective of alien races known as the Covenant. Humanity's best defense against the Covenant is the SPARTAN Project, super-soldiers in powered armor, but these elite troops are too few to turn the tide of war in the UNSC's favor. Following a Covenant attack on Reach, a planet within UNSC jurisdiction, the Pillar of Autumn flees randomly coming across an ancient installation built by the mysterious Forerunner. The Covenant call this relic Halo, and believe it is a weapon and means of <b>transcendence.</b> UNSC discover that Halo is in fact a method of containing a parasite known as the Flood, by destroying all sentient life to prevent the Flood from spreading beyond Halo. The SPARTAN Master Chief and his artificial intelligence companion, Cortana, detonate the Pillar of Autumns engines, destroying Halo. Escaping the destruction via a fighter, the Chief and Cortana believe themselves the only survivors of the catastrophe.|$|E
5|$|Some {{users of}} the drug {{consider}} it an entheogen and a tool to supplement practices for <b>transcendence,</b> including meditation and psychonautics. The intensity and duration {{of the effects of}} psilocybin are variable, depending on species or cultivar of mushrooms, dosage, individual physiology, and set and setting, as was shown in experiments led by Timothy Leary at Harvard University in the early 1960s. Once ingested, psilocybin is rapidly metabolized to psilocin, which then acts on serotonin receptors in the brain. The mind-altering effects of psilocybin typically last from two to six hours, although to individuals under the influence of psilocybin, the effects may seem to last much longer, since the drug can distort the perception of time. Psilocybin has a low toxicity and a relatively low harm potential, and reports of lethal doses of the drug are rare. Several modern bioanalytical methods have been adapted to rapidly and accurately screen the levels of psilocybin in mushroom samples and body fluids. Since the 1990s, there has been a renewal of scientific research into the potential medical and psychological therapeutic benefits of psilocybin for treating conditions including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety, treatment-resistant depression, cluster headaches, and anxiety related to terminal cancer. Possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries, and it has been classified as a scheduled drug by many national drug laws.|$|E

25|$|<b>Transcendence</b> (paired {{with the}} term The Encompassing in later works) is, for Jaspers, that which exists beyond the world of time and space. Jaspers' {{formulation}} of <b>Transcendence</b> as ultimate non-objectivity (or no-thing-ness) has led many philosophers to argue that ultimately, Jaspers became a monist, though Jaspers himself continually stressed the necessity of recognizing {{the validity of the}} concepts both of subjectivity and of objectivity.|$|E

25|$|Two {{attributes}} of God that place him above the world, yet acknowledge {{his involvement in}} the world, are <b>transcendence</b> and immanence. <b>Transcendence</b> means that God is eternal and infinite, not controlled by the created world and beyond human events. Immanence means that God is involved in the world, and Christian teachings have long acknowledged his attention to human affairs. However, unlike pantheistic religions, in Christianity God's being is not of the substance of the created universe.|$|E

25|$|After {{evaluating}} AA's {{literature and}} observing AA meetings for sixteen months, sociologists David R. Rudy and Arthur L. Greil {{found that for}} an AA member to remain sober {{a high level of}} commitment is necessary. This commitment is facilitated by a change in the member's worldview. To help members stay sober AA must, they argue, provide an all-encompassing worldview while creating and sustaining an atmosphere of <b>transcendence</b> in the organization. To be all-encompassing AA's ideology places an emphasis on tolerance rather than on a narrow religious worldview that could make the organization unpalatable to potential members and thereby limit its effectiveness. AA's emphasis on the spiritual nature of its program, however, is necessary to institutionalize a feeling of <b>transcendence.</b> A tension results from the risk that the necessity of <b>transcendence,</b> if taken too literally, would compromise AA's efforts to maintain a broad appeal. As this tension {{is an integral part of}} AA, Rudy and Greil argue that AA is best described as a quasi-religious organization.|$|E

25|$|The simple modernist {{design is}} both {{functional}} and iconographic to express its religiosity. From the main portico, the Door of Christ brings {{attention to the}} <b>transcendence</b> of God. It represents the themes of Father, Son and Holy Spirit with iconic imagery.|$|E
25|$|The Devi Mahatmya, states C. Mackenzie Brown, {{is both a}} {{culmination}} of centuries of Indian ideas about the divine feminine, {{as well as a}} foundation for the literature and spirituality focussed on the feminine <b>transcendence</b> in centuries that followed.|$|E
25|$|The first hypothesis, secularization, {{holds that}} science and {{technology}} will {{take the place of}} religion. Secularization supports the separation of religion from politics, ethics, and psychology. Taking this position even further, Taylor explains that secularization denies <b>transcendence,</b> divinity, and rationality in religious beliefs.|$|E

25|$|If R is an {{integral}} domain that is a finitely generated k-algebra, then its dimension is the <b>transcendence</b> degree of its field of fractions over k. If S is {{an integral}} extension of a commutative ring R, then S and R have the same dimension.|$|E
25|$|Things such as {{scientific}} tools, political institutions, and {{the conventional}} rules of morality as dictated by traditional religion {{need to be}} transcended. This is found in Henry David Thoreau's Walden; or, Life in the Woods where <b>transcendence</b> is achieved through immersion in nature and the distancing of oneself from society.|$|E
25|$|The core of Prem Rawat's {{teaching}} {{is that the}} individual’s need for fulfillment can be satisfied by turning within to contact {{a constant source of}} peace and joy. Rather than a body of dogma, he emphasizes a direct experience of <b>transcendence</b> that he says is accessible through the meditation techniques he teaches.|$|E
25|$|Tara can be {{distinguished}} visually from Kali primarily via her implements. Four armed, she carries a sacrificial sword, a severed head or skull cup, a lotus and scissors. The scissor symbolizes Tara's ability to cut through unwanted habits thus freeing the individual for spiritual <b>transcendence.</b> Kali never holds a lotus or a pair of scissors.|$|E
25|$|Let R be an algebra over a field k {{that is an}} {{integral}} domain. Then the Krull dimension of R is {{less than or equal}} to the <b>transcendence</b> degree of the field of fractions of R over k. The equality holds if R is finitely generated as algebra (for instance by the noether normalization lemma).|$|E
25|$|<b>Transcendence</b> is {{the story}} of Brynn Dharielle and her quest to free her people from the tyranny of the Behrenese kingdom. With the help of Belli'mar Juraviel, elven trainer of the rangers Elbryan and Brynn (among many others), a dragon named Agradeleas, and others, Brynn works hard {{throughout}} the story to see her dream of freedom come true.|$|E
25|$|Theoria: Ruskin's 'theoretic' faculty – theoretic, {{as opposed}} to {{aesthetic}} – enables {{a vision of the}} beautiful as intimating a reality deeper than the everyday, {{at least in terms of}} the kind of <b>transcendence</b> generally seen as immanent in things of this world. For an example of the influence of Ruskin's concept of theoria, see Peter Fuller.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{orientation}} of one's consciousness, introverted or extroverted, emission can be of two kinds: rested and risen. In Śānta, the rested form of emission, focus is absorbed just on one's own Self {{in an act of}} <b>transcendence.</b> In Udita, the risen form, the focus is projected on the Self (atman) of one's lover– a state associated with immanence.|$|E
25|$|The Ekavyāvahārika sect {{emphasized}} the <b>transcendence</b> of the Buddha, asserting {{that he was}} eternally enlightened and essentially non-physical. According to the Ekavyāvahārika, {{the words of the}} Buddha were spoken with one transcendent meaning, and the Four Noble Truths are to be understood simultaneously in one moment of insight. According to the Mahīśāsaka sect, the Four Noble Truths should be meditated upon simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Hellenistic civilization {{was highly}} cultured and sophisticated. Although the Greeks {{had a strong}} sense of {{aesthetics}}, they were highly pompous, and they viewed aesthetics as an end in itself. They were excessively attached to the quality of Tiferet, beauty. This was also related to an appreciation of the intellect’s <b>transcendence</b> over the body, which reveals the beauty of the spirit.|$|E
25|$|Ishida Hitoshi {{makes the}} case that the image of the bishōnen is more about a {{grounding}} in sexuality than a <b>transcendence</b> of it, drawing on the idea of the image as being a refuge for alternative methods of looking at sexual natures, and sexual realities, at least since the 60's, rather than the elegiac aesthetics of usages in an earlier era.|$|E
25|$|Seeking {{to defend}} the {{assertion}} that humans can become like God through deification without compromising God's <b>transcendence,</b> Palamas distinguished between God's inaccessible essence and the energies through which he becomes known and enables to share his divine life. The central idea of the Palamite theology is {{a distinction between the}} divine essence and the divine energies that is not a merely conceptual distinction.|$|E
