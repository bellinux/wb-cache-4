25|$|In the 1990s, Kornheiser usually wrote three columns per week, {{which were}} a Tuesday column and a Thursday column in <b>the</b> <b>Sports</b> <b>Section</b> and a Sunday {{column in the}} Style Section. Because of his work on both radio and Pardon the Interruption, he stopped writing Style Section columns and only wrote one column a week. His last Style Section column was {{published}} on September 30, 2001. His three books, Pumping Irony, Bald as I Wanna Be and I'm Back for More Cash, are the compilations of his Style Section columns.|$|E
25|$|He was {{fortunate}} {{in having a}} station commander in Group Captain Jim Warfield who was a cricket enthusiast and was willing to grant him leave for Test and occasional county matches. In addition, Warfield decided to employ Trueman in <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> <b>section,</b> looking after the equipment and playing fields. However, this relaxation of the usual rules caused questions to be raised in the House of Commons after the mother of another conscript complained to her local MP that her son had been refused leave {{to take part in}} a national banjo playing championship. Trueman claimed that he was the first person to be mentioned in Hansard in a cricketing connection. His identity in the RAF was AC2 F. S. Trueman 2549485. He was later promoted to AC1.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{graduating from}} Central Collegiate, Lougheed {{enrolled}} at the University of Alberta from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (in 1950 or 1951) and a Bachelor of Laws (in 1952). There, he played football for the University of Alberta Golden Bears and, in 1949 and 1950, the Edmonton Eskimos. He also {{served as president of}} the Students' Union in 1951–1952 and was a writer in <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> <b>section</b> for the Gateway, the University of Alberta student newspaper. While studying at the University of Alberta, he lived for a time in Rutherford House as a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity. In 1952, he married Jeanne Rogers, whom he met during his schooling. Soon after the wedding, the couple went to Massachusetts, where Lougheed pursued a Master of Business Administration at Harvard University, which he earned in 1954. During the degree, he worked for a summer with Gulf Oil in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he witnessed an oil boom town after the oil ran out; political scientist Allan Tupper has suggested that Lougheed saw here a possible future of Alberta.|$|E
500|$|In May 1915, DeBeck and {{a partner}} named Carter {{launched}} a newspaper syndicate and correspondence cartooning course; DeBeck's advice to his correspondence students was: [...] "First learn how to draw—then go to a good art school and get a firm foundation in the arts". [...] The school was not a success, and DeBeck returned to Chicago and joined the Chicago Herald in December 1915. [...] He worked on a strip called Finn an' Haddie for the Adams Newspaper Service on the side. [...] On December 9, immediately after starting at the Herald, he began a strip called Married Life that so {{caught the attention of}} Hearst; legend says that, to acquire DeBeck, Hearst bought the Herald and merged it with the Chicago Examiner, as DeBeck had refused to join the Hearst empire after the Examiner raised his monthly salary from $35 to $200. [...] DeBeck's creations were first adapted to film when an animated version of Married Life appeared in a Seattle Sunday Times newsreel in 1917. [...] DeBeck created a number of other features, especially for <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> <b>section,</b> while his antics made him something of a local celebrity.|$|E
500|$|The {{record was}} not highly {{anticipated}} like the four-minute mile had been. In Philadelphia, {{there was little}} fanfare in The Philadelphia Inquirer or The Philadelphia Bulletin, which both had a box {{on the front page}} announcing the achievement with a story in <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> <b>section.</b> Philadelphia Daily News had no mention on its cover. The Bulletin wrote, [...] "Thus was fulfilled a prophecy made the first time the magnificent 7'1" [...] scoring star of the Warriors played a game in the National Basketball Association three years ago." [...] New York City papers ran stories from the news agencies. The New York Times and The New York Herald Tribune ran the AP story on pages 14 and 11, respectively. The New York Daily News ran the UPI story on page 26. The New York Post gave prominent back-page coverage to Chamberlain's feat on Sunday. The New York Daily News on Sunday wrote, [...] "Basketball is not prospering because most normal sized American youngsters or adults cannot identify themselves with the freakish stars ... You just can't sell a seven-foot basket stuffing monster to even the most gullible adolescent." [...] In his prime, Chamberlain was such a dominant scorer that his feat was mostly taken for granted. Warriors player Al Attles said that after Chamberlain's previous record 78-point game, [...] "It {{was only a matter of}} time until he reached 100, you could wait for it." [...] Warriors coach Frank McGuire initially thought the same thing, then said, [...] "I always thought it was inevitable that he would do it. But when he did, I stopped and thought about it. I couldn't believe it." ...|$|E

500|$|Reid's ideas, however, [...] "were prosaic in the extreme". [...] His {{promotions}} included printing <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> <b>section</b> {{on green}} newsprint and a pocket-sized magazine for television listings that initially stopped the Sunday paper's circulation skid, but proved an empty product. [...] The Tribune turned a profit in 1956, but the Times was rapidly outpacing it in news content, circulation, and ad revenue. [...] The promotions largely failed {{to hold on}} to the Tribunes new audiences; the Sunday edition began to slide again and the paper fell into the red in 1957. Through the decade, the Tribune was the only newspaper in the city to see its share of ad lineage drop, and longtime veterans of the paper, including Bigart, began departing. The Reids, who had by now turned their mortgage into stock, began seeking buyers to infuse the Tribune with cash, turning to John Hay [...] "Jock" [...] Whitney, whose family had a long association with the Reids. [...] Whitney, recently named ambassador to Great Britain, had chaired Dwight Eisenhower's fundraising campaigns in 1952 and 1956 and was looking for something else to engage him beyond his largely ceremonial role in Great Britain. [...] Whitney, who [...] "did not want the Tribune to die", gave the newspaper $1.2 million over the objections of his investment advisors, who had doubts about the newspaper's viability. The loan came with the option to take controlling interest of the newspaper if he made a second loan of $1.3 million. [...] Brown Reid expected the $1.2 million to cover a deficit that would last through the end of 1958, but by that year the newspaper's loss was projected at $3 million, and Whitney and his advisors decided to exercise their option. The Reids, claiming to have put $20 million into the newspaper since the 1924 merger [...] initially attempted to keep editorial control of the paper, but Whitney made it clear he would not invest additional money in the Tribune if the Reids remained at the helm. [...] The family yielded, and Helen, Whitie and Brown Reid announced Whitney's takeover of the newspaper on August 28, 1958. The Reids retained a substantial stake in the Tribune until its demise, but Whitney and his advisors controlled the paper.|$|E

2500|$|Smith found that, at the time, nobody {{believed}} in her concept of stylish activewear. As she later recalled, even major brands like Nike {{did not have}} concept stores for their clothing in those days. When Bill Clarkson showed the products to major department store Myer, their fashion buyers were uninterested and unsure of how to position the garments. He recalls that when he explained the clothes should not be sold in <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> <b>section,</b> [...] "The buyer {{looked at me like}} I was crazy. They had no box to put me in." [...] Eventually, Myer bought a small range for five of their stores and stocked it in a corner between swimwear and lingerie. The Lorna Jane corporate website {{goes so far as to}} credit Smith with coining the word [...] "activewear" [...] in 1989, although the Merriam-Webster dictionary notes the word's first known usage was in 1924.|$|E
2500|$|Social {{media can}} be used not only as public {{relations}} and direct marketing tools but also as communication channels targeting very specific audiences with social media influencers and social media personalities and as effective customer engagement tools. [...] Technologies predating social media, such as broadcast TV and newspapers can also provide advertisers with a fairly targeted audience, given that an ad placed during a sports game broadcast or in <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> <b>section</b> of a newspaper {{is likely to be}} read by sports fans. However, social media websites can target niche markets even more precisely. Using digital tools such as Google Adsense, advertisers can target their ads to very specific demographics, such as people who are interested in social entrepreneurship, political activism associated with a particular political party, or video gaming. Google Adsense does this by looking for keywords in social media user's online posts and comments. It would be hard for a TV station or paper-based newspaper to provide ads that are this targeted (though not impossible, as can be seen with [...] "special issue" [...] sections on niche issues, which newspapers can use to sell targeted ads).|$|E
2500|$|For {{several days}} the water {{authority}} insisted {{the water was}} safe, and should be mixed with orange juice to disguise {{the taste of the}} as yet unknown contaminant. One customer who telephoned the authority the day after the contamination was told [...] "there had been some acidity, but the water was perfectly safe to drink," [...] and was no more harmful than lemon juice. On 14 July 1988 the authority sent a circular letter to all customers [...] "asserting that the water from the treatment works was of the right alkalinity and was safe to use and drink." [...] Within two days, the authority suspected the source of the contamination was the erroneous delivery, which was confirmed on 12 July when the driver was asked to return to the treatment works. However, it was not until ten days later on 22 July that the authority's chairman Keith Court authorised a public notice, containing the first mention of the aluminium sulphate, to be published in <b>the</b> <b>sports</b> <b>section</b> of a local newspaper, the Western Morning News. Stephens stated that after the site meeting where he confirmed he had delivered the chemical to the wrong tank he was told by the authority [...] "not to mention it to anyone else". The SWWA district manager, John Lewis, said they had realised within 48 hours that aluminium sulphate was the likely cause of the contamination, but Lewis said he had been instructed by Leslie Nicks, the head of operations, not to tell the public.|$|E
