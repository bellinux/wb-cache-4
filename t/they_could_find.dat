5|$|Stark {{began to}} move his force to Hog Island at about 10 am and {{directed}} most of his men to round up livestock there while he forded Crooked Creek to Noddle's Island {{with a group of}} thirty men. Stark's small contingent on Noddle's Island scattered into small groups, killed the animals <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find,</b> and set fire to haystacks and barns.|$|E
5|$|By this time, however, North Korean {{logistics}} {{had been}} stretched to their limit, and resupply became increasingly difficult. By {{the beginning of}} August, the North Korean units operating in the area were getting little to no food and ammunition supply, instead relying on captured UN weapons and foraging for what <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> They were also exhausted from over a month of advancing, though morale remained high among the 766th troops. The 766th Regiment specialized in raiding UN supply lines, and effectively mounted small disruptive attacks against UN targets to equip themselves.|$|E
5|$|Eos– The Goddess of Dawn and {{the sister}} of Helios. Eos told Kratos of the machinations of Morpheus, who had taken {{advantage}} of her brother's disappearance. When Kratos found Eos in the Caves of Olympus, she advised him to find the Primordial Fires and free Helios' loyal Fire Steeds, as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> the Sun God. She also provided him with the magical ability, Light of Dawn. She did not appear in God of War III, leaving her fate unknown. The character was voiced by Erin Torpey in Chains of Olympus.|$|E
25|$|The judge {{instructed}} {{the jury that}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> Mrs Gough guilty of manslaughter, since only Mr Gough {{was strong enough to}} have inflicted the trauma which killed Dennis, but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> still <b>find</b> her guilty of neglect.|$|R

5|$|Page and Brin {{used the}} former's basic HTML {{programming}} skills {{to set up}} a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional servers to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google, still on the Stanford University website, was made available to Internet users.|$|E
5|$|Renoir {{continued}} shooting additional {{scenes with}} some of the actors. The opening scene at the airfield was shot in mid-June at the Bourget Airport {{in the middle of the}} night with whatever extras <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> Renoir had almost run out of money when he filmed the car crash scene, which was shot very quickly with Alain Renoir as the camera operator. Renoir never liked the scene and initially removed it. The principal photography was nine and a half weeks over schedule when it was finally wrapped in June.|$|E
5|$|Some months later, {{the town}} has {{constructed}} a statue of the Giant in its memory, friendship, and heroism, and Dean and Annie are starting a relationship. Hogarth receives a package from Rogard, a bolt from the Giant being the only remnant <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> That night, Hogarth sees the bolt trying to move on its own, and he opens the window, letting the bolt roll free. The bolt joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the Langjökull glacier in Iceland. The Giant's head activates, and he smiles as he puts itself back together.|$|E
25|$|According to Oiarzabal and Tabernilla, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> Carranza, Aguirre, Fernández Bakaicoa or Juanana in the NARA or US Army archives.|$|R
60|$|The {{eyes of the}} two men met for {{a moment}} both unflinchingly. Perhaps they were each searching for {{something}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>find.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1997 {{another team}} reached the place {{but this time}} <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> the buildings, covered under thicker ice. They left fuel tanks for future {{operations}} in the region.|$|R
5|$|The {{existing}} {{court and}} the anti-relief party refused to recognize the new court as valid. Achilles Sneed, clerk of the Old Court, refused a legislative mandate to turn over his records to the New Court by January 1825. Francis Blair, the New Court clerk, assembled a group that broke into Sneed's office and took what records <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> Sneed was charged with contempt of court and fined for refusing {{to turn over the}} records. The Old Court continued to meet in a church in Frankfort; with two supreme courts, the possibility of civil war in Kentucky loomed.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues identified the tooth as a mammal; although some non-mammalian groups, like crocodylians, may have complex teeth, none approach the level of complexity seen in LACM 149371. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> no resemblance to australosphenidans including monotremes, metatherians including marsupials, xenarthrans, and some related groups. They did see some general resemblances to the upper premolars of the early South American ungulates, but the cusp arrangement is different from that of any ungulate. There are also some resemblances to the early rodents Ivanantonia from Asia and Nonomys from North America, but Ivanantonia has a central groove and lacks fossae, and Nonomys has a prominent cingulum (shelf) {{at the edges of the}} tooth and also lacks the fossae of LACM 149371.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell and Gene Lipkin, Atari's {{vice-president}} of sales, approached toy and electronic retailers to sell Home Pong, but were rejected. Retailers felt {{the product was}} too expensive and would not interest consumers. Atari contacted the Sears Sporting Goods department after noticing a Magnavox Odyssey advertisement in the sporting goods section of its catalog. Atari staff discussed {{the game with a}} representative, Tom Quinn, who expressed enthusiasm and offered the company an exclusive deal. Believing <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> more favorable terms elsewhere, Atari's executives declined and continued to pursue toy retailers. In January 1975, Atari staff set up a Home Pong booth at a toy trade fair in New York City, but was unsuccessful in soliciting orders {{due to the fact that}} they did not know that they needed a private showing.|$|E
50|$|On October 25, 2003, {{a project}} {{team from the}} Japanese Archaeological Association stated that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> any {{evidence}} to make judgments {{whether there was a}} fabrication or not.|$|R

50|$|The {{number of}} people working in {{part-time}} jobs because <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> a full-time one is sometimes used {{as a proxy for}} the number of underemployed people in the economy.|$|R
5|$|Casting for {{the episode}} was difficult, as the {{production}} team wanted real Africans. They auditioned every one <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find,</b> including an African theater troupe that was passing by. The role of Marcus Duff eventually went to Carl Lumbly, {{who was known}} for his role on CBS's Cagney & Lacey. The role of Aboah went to Willie Amakye, a Ghanaian Olympic runner who had just returned to his home in Southern California from the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. To appear albino, Amakye's skin underwent several layers of cover-up cream, layers of white powder, and a little pink powder for color. He also wore contacts for the transparent pink eyes. Amakye's hair was dyed orange for post-production special effects to change it back and forth from black and white. As revealed on his resident alien card, Aboah's birthday is September 25, a reference to the birthday of Gillian Anderson's daughter.|$|E
5|$|Hoping to {{take the}} stronghold by surprise, on May 7 Pontiac entered Fort Detroit with about 300 men {{carrying}} concealed weapons. The British had learned of Pontiac's plan, however, and were armed and ready. His tactic foiled, Pontiac withdrew after a brief council and, two days later, laid siege to the fort. Pontiac and his allies killed all of the British soldiers and settlers <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> outside of the fort, including women and children. One of the soldiers was ritually cannibalized, as was the custom in some Great Lakes Native cultures. The violence was directed at the British; French colonists were generally left alone. Eventually more than 900 soldiers from a half-dozen tribes joined the siege. Meanwhile, on May 28 a British supply column from Fort Niagara led by Lieutenant Abraham Cuyler was ambushed and defeated at Point Pelee.|$|E
5|$|Most Doctor Who episodes {{were made}} on two-inch {{videotape}} for initial broadcast and then telerecorded onto 16 mm film by BBC Enterprises for further commercial exploitation. Enterprises used 16mm for overseas sales as it was considerably cheaper to buy and easier to transport than videotape. It also circumvented the problem of different countries' incompatible video standards, as film was a universal medium whereas videotape was not. The BBC had no central archive at the time; the Film Library kept programmes {{that had been made}} on film, while the Engineering Department was responsible for storing videotapes. BBC Enterprises only kept copies of programmes they deemed commercially exploitable. They had little dedicated storage space, and tended to place piles of film canisters wherever <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> space for them at their Villiers House property.|$|E
6000|$|I {{wondered}} {{what had become}} of Delcarte and Taylor and Snider. Would they search for me? <b>They</b> <b>could</b> never <b>find</b> me, I feared, yet if <b>they</b> did, what <b>could</b> <b>they</b> accomplish against this horde of savage warriors? ...|$|R

5|$|Not all cyclists were {{competing}} for the victory; some only joined as tourists. The most notable of them was Henri Pépin. Pépin had hired two riders, Jean Dargassies and Henri Gauban, to ride with him. They treated the race as a pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending {{the night in the}} best hotels <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists {{in the history of the}} Tour de France to ride not for their own placings but for another rider's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, Jean-Marie Teychenne, lying in a ditch. They helped him get up and fed him; from then on Teychenne also helped Pépin.|$|E
5|$|Szilárd {{teamed up}} with Fermi {{to build a nuclear}} reactor from natural uranium at Columbia University, where they were {{fortunate}} in having a sympathetic head of the physics department in George B. Pegram. At the time there was disagreement about whether it was uranium-235, which made up less than 1% of natural uranium, or the more abundant uranium-238 isotope, as Fermi maintained, that was primarily responsible for fission. Fermi and Szilárd conducted a series of experiments, and concluded that a chain reaction in natural uranium could be possible if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> a suitable neutron moderator. They found that the hydrogen atoms in water slowed neutrons, but tended to capture them. Szilárd then suggested using carbon as a moderator. They now needed large quantities of carbon and uranium to create a reactor. Szilárd was convinced that they would succeed if only they could get the materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E

5|$|The {{planetary}} {{exploration of}} the original Mass Effect was completely revamped. Instead of having large barren landscapes, the designers opted to build distinct and interesting places. The goal was to encourage players to keep exploring the galaxy by changing their expectations about what <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> Originally, developers experimented {{with the idea of}} having a vehicle that could be used to navigate the planetary terrain in a more flexible way than in the original title. However, the vehicle was ultimately removed from the final build of the game. The context-sensitive interrupt system, which was originally meant to be a feature in the original Mass Effect, was introduced in Mass Effect 2 to help blend the dialogue better with the rest of the action.|$|E
5|$|This period also {{marked a}} phase of {{considerable}} travel to the Middle East by European civilians and minor nobility, and in the process, some travelers noticed that the Arabian horse as a pure breed of horse was under threat due to modern forms of warfare, inbreeding and other problems that were reducing the horse population of the Bedouin tribes at a rapid rate. By the late 19th century, the most farsighted began in earnest to collect the finest Arabian horses <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> {{in order to preserve}} the blood of the pure desert horse for future generations. The most famous example was Lady Anne Blunt, the daughter of Ada Lovelace and granddaughter of Lord Byron.|$|E
5|$|At 16:02, {{still waiting}} for a {{definitive}} report on {{the location of the}} Japanese fleet carriers, the U.S. carriers' radar detected the first incoming wave of Japanese strike aircraft. Fifty-three F4F-4 Wildcat fighters from the two U.S. carriers were directed by radar control towards the attackers. However, communication problems, limitations of the aircraft identification capabilities of the radar, primitive control procedures, and effective screening of the Japanese dive bombers by their escorting Zeros, prevented all {{but a few of the}} U.S. fighters from engaging the Vals before they began their attacks on the U.S. carriers. Just before the Japanese dive bombers began their attacks, Enterprise and Saratoga cleared their decks for the impending action by launching the aircraft that they had been holding ready in case the Japanese fleet carriers were sighted. These aircraft were told to fly north and attack anything <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>find,</b> or else to circle outside the battle zone, until it was safe to return.|$|E
60|$|After Maria was gone, {{the boys}} {{looked around the}} shop, but <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> any thing which exactly pleased them; or at least <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>find</b> any thing which pleased them {{so much more than}} any thing else, that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> decide in favor of it.
