500|$|Reading {{agreed to}} allow Boucaud to rejoin Peterborough on loan in June 2003, and Reading manager Alan Pardew said: [...] "he's done enough <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>me</b> that I shouldn't keep him there for too long". His return to Peterborough was {{completed}} on an initial one-month loan on 8 August 2003. His first appearance after returning was in a 4–3 defeat home to Hartlepool United the following day, and in September 2003 Peterborough manager Barry Fry {{said he wanted to}} extend Boucaud's stay at the club. Having made nine appearances and scored one goal for Peterborough in two months, he returned to Reading on 7 October 2003.|$|E

I {{was the one}} who always [...] off choir, but I had an incredible music teacher who managed <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>me</b> I could do anything." [...] However, she felt that she [...] "stuck out" [...] by being from a lower-income family than the other girls at the school. At the age of 16, she moved to Greece with her father [...] "to connect with my heritage and learn to speak the language", and sang Greek folk songs with her grandmother. Having earned an International Baccalaureate at St. Catherine's British Embassy School in Athens, she returned to Wales two years later. She and her mother then moved to Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire. Obsessed with becoming a singer, [...] "almost {{as if it was a}} disease", she worked at a petrol station for two months in order to earn money to move to London.|$|E
500|$|Given {{the task}} of {{overhauling}} the Cardinals by owner Gussie Busch (and specifically to unload Templeton), Herzog was looking to trade Templeton when he was approached by Padres General Manager Jack McKeon at the 1981 baseball winter meetings. While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal. [...] McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece. It was then that Padres manager Dick Williams informed Herzog that a no-trade clause had been included in Smith's 1981 contract. Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in San Diego, {{but he was still}} interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say. While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday. Smith later recalled that, [...] "Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out there to talk to us was more than enough <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>me</b> that St. Louis was the place I wanted to be." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1880s, Stanford collaborated with the author Gilbert à Beckett on two operas, Savonarola, and The Canterbury Pilgrims. The former was well {{received}} at its premiere in Hamburg in April 1884, but received a critical savaging when staged at Covent Garden in July of the same year. Parry commented privately, [...] "It seems very badly constructed for the stage, poorly conceived and the music, though clean and well-managed, is not striking or dramatic." [...] The most severe public criticism was in The Theatre, whose reviewer wrote, [...] "The book of Savonarola is dull, stilted, and, from a dramatic point of view, weak. It is not, however, so crushingly tiresome as the music fitted to it. Savonarola has gone far <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>me</b> that opera is quite out of [...] line and that the sooner he abandons the stage for the cathedral, the better for his musical reputation." [...] The Canterbury Pilgrims had been premiered in London in April 1884, three months before Savonarola was presented at Covent Garden. It had a better reception than the latter, though reviews pointed out Stanford's debt to Die Meistersinger, and complained of a lack of emotion in the love music. George Grove agreed with the critics, writing to Parry, [...] "Charlie's music contains everything but sentiment. Love not at all – that I heard not a grain of. ... And I do think that there might be more tune. Melody is not a thing to be avoided surely." [...] In 1896 a critic wrote that the opera had [...] "just such a 'book' as would have suited the late Alfred Cellier. He would probably have made of it a charming light English opera. But Dr. Stanford has chosen to use it for the exemplification of those advanced theories which we know him to hold, and he has given us music which would incline us to think that Die Meistersinger had been his model. The effect of the combination is not happy." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this paper {{is part of an}} ongoing research program investigating computer support of coherent reasoning in individuals and groups. Drawing from research investigating reasoning with a theory-based computer model, we have developed a computer learning environment designed to help students create, manage, and evaluate arguments. In attempting <b>to</b> "convince" the <b>Convince</b> <b>Me</b> program, students are encouraged to reflect on their reasoning strategies. We present results from a classroom intervention that highlight how the program's representations provide a structure for collaborative argument building and mediate communication among students, prompting them to engage in shared explanatory and reflective activity. The results also suggest that feedback from the program's simulation of argument coherence encourages even greater student reflection on argument construction and evaluation...|$|R

5000|$|Despite Sykes' {{doubts about}} joining a major record label {{and how it}} would affect the band's musical output (believing they would try <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Bring <b>Me</b> the Horizon to release {{something}} more radio friendly), RCA and Sony pushed the band to [...] "write the heaviest album they can." [...] However, instead of going for a heavier sound, Bring Me the Horizon pooled more diverse influences {{in preparation for the}} writing of Sempiternal.

60|$|That any evil {{directly}} {{follows from}} the closest interbreeding has been denied by many persons; but rarely by any practical breeder; and never, as far as I know, by one who has largely bred animals which propagate their kind quickly. Many physiologists attribute the evil exclusively to the combination and consequent increase of morbid tendencies common to both parents; {{and that this is}} an active source of mischief there can be no doubt. It is unfortunately too notorious that men and various domestic animals endowed with a wretched constitution, and with a strong hereditary disposition to disease, if not actually ill, are fully capable of procreating their kind. Close interbreeding, on the other hand, often induces sterility; and this indicates something quite distinct from the augmentation of morbid tendencies common to both parents. The evidence immediately <b>to</b> be given <b>convinces</b> <b>me</b> that it is a great law of nature, that all organic beings profit from an occasional cross with individuals not closely related to them in blood; and that, on the other hand, long-continued close interbreeding is injurious.|$|R
60|$|Next to {{cochineal}} in the Canary Islands, {{especially in}} Tenerife, ranks the gallo, or fighting-cock. Cockfighting' amongst ourselves is redolent of foul tobacco, bad beer, and ruffianism in low places. This {{is not the}} case in Spain and her colonies, where the classical sport of Greece and Rome still holds its ground. I have pleasant reminiscences of the good Padre in the Argentine Republic who after mass repaired regularly to the pit, wearing his huge canoe-like hat and carrying under his arm a well-bred bird instead of a breviary. Here too I was told that the famous Derby breed of the twelfth Earl had extended in past times throughout the length and breadth of the land; and the next visit <b>to</b> Knowsley <b>convinced</b> <b>me</b> that the legend was based on fact. As regards cruelty, all popular sports, fox-hunting and pigeon-shooting, are cruel. Grallus, however, has gained since the days of Cock-Mondays and Cock-Fridays, when he was staked down to be killed by 'cock-sticks' or was whipped to his death by blindfolded carters. He leads the life of a friar; he is tended carefully as any babe; he is permitted to indulge his pugnacity, which it would be harsh to restrain, and at worst he dies fighting like a gentleman. A Tenerifan would shudder at the horror of our fashionable sport, where ruffians gouge or blind the pigeon with a pin, squeeze it to torture, wrench out its tail, and thrust the upper through the lower mandible.|$|R
