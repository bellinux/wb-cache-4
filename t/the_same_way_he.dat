5|$|All {{the main}} Family Guy cast members lent their voices to the episode, along with writers Kirker Butler, John Viener, Alec Sulkin, Mark Hentemann, and Danny Smith, who all had minor {{speaking}} roles. Peter's boyfriend Scott was voiced by recurring voice actor John G. Brennan, who voices him in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> voices gay The Jerky Boys character Jack Tors. Other guest stars included writer Wellesley Wild, actress Meredith Baxter-Birney, and actor Seth Rogen.|$|E
5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a question that was unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E
5|$|A {{notoriously}} violent man, Yamashita {{was known}} for his many street fights. In the most famous instance, he got involved in a brawl with no less than 17 laborers in Tokyo due to a dispute in a restaurant. Despite their vast numeric advantage, added to {{the fact that some of}} them wielded knives, Yamashita and a fellow judoka disposed of all the men, purposely breaking the arms of three of them in the process. Shortly after, Yoshiaki would get into another quarrel with another cadre of laborers, this time him against 15 of them, but it ended up the same way: Yamashita maimed his attackers with chokes and throws, and even killed some of them by breaking their necks. He was arrested, but was easily acquitted after proving the uneven nature of the brawls. However, he was still suspended by the Kodokan for excessive use of violence. When confronted by Kano himself, Yamashita protested and went to the extent of challenging his master to a fight, but Kano convinced to stop his violent ways by making him realize that some day he might be harmed <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> liked to harm people.|$|E

It then cuts to Timberlake in a different room; then to a club scene and Timberlake {{in front of a}} white background. The video alternates between those four viewpoints, with Timberlake and Anaya seeming to be spies in the hotel room and strangers in the club. At a certain point, Timberlake goes over to Anaya's room by jumping over to her balcony. Then when Anaya goes to check it out, Timberlake traps and passionately has sex with her. In the club, it ends with Timberlake kissing Anaya in a bathroom stall. In the hotel room scene, Timberlake leaves by <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> entered and moments later jumps to the next balcony before an explosion ensues. It ends with the figure of Anaya sitting in a chair beside a small television in which a kiss is frozen on the screen.|$|E
5|$|Schirra gave {{a public}} lecture at Rice University after {{returning}} to Houston, where he received a motorcade through the city. However, the Cuban Missile Crisis had been steadily escalating through September, and helped drive discussion of Schirra's successful flight down the news schedules; public concern about the relative effectiveness of Soviet and American space launchers was displaced by a more pressing concern over Soviet military rockets. He visited Washington, D.C., to receive the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President Kennedy on October 16, the same day Kennedy had first seen U-2 photographs of missile sites in Cuba; the meeting was friendly and informal despite the circumstances. Robert Kennedy, Schirra later noted, took him aside and sounded him out about a potential political career, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> had sounded out John Glenn a year earlier. Unlike Glenn, however, Schirra politely turned the suggestion down, and chose to remain with NASA. His later career saw him commanding the backup crew for the first Gemini mission, then the prime crew for the 1965 Gemini 6A mission, where he flew the first active rendezvous between two spacecraft - earlier plans for it to conduct the first on-orbit docking had been cancelled - and finally commanding the first Apollo mission, Apollo 7, in 1968. He retired from NASA {{in the summer of}} 1969, the only astronaut to fly on Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.|$|E

Bayta had realized, shortly before, that Magnifico was actually the Mule, who had used his powers in every planet they had previously visited.

25|$|Jaspers {{thought that}} psychiatrists could {{diagnose}} delusions in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> argued that clinicians should not consider a belief delusional {{based on the}} content of the belief, but only based on the way in which a patient holds such a belief. (See delusion for further discussion.) Jaspers also distinguished between primary and secondary delusions. He defined primary delusions as autochthonous, meaning that they arise without apparent cause, appearing incomprehensible in terms of a normal mental process. (This is a slightly different use of the word autochthonous than the ordinary medical or sociological use as a synonym for indigenous.) Secondary delusions, on the other hand, he defined as those influenced by the person's background, current situation or mental state.|$|E
25|$|Although Ahmadi Muslims {{believe that}} the Quran is the final message of God for mankind, they also believe that God {{continues}} to communicate with his chosen individuals in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> {{is believed to have}} done in the past. All of God's attributes are eternal. In particular, Ahmadi Muslims believes that Muhammad brought prophethood to perfection and was the last law-bearing prophet and the apex of humankind's spiritual evolution. New prophets can come, but they must be completely subordinate to Muhammad and {{will not be able to}} exceed him in excellence nor alter his teaching or bring any new law or religion. They are also thought of as reflections of Muhammad rather than independently made into Prophets, like the Prophets of antiquity.|$|E

Likewise, Clinton was struggling to overcome setbacks after she came in third place at the caucuses in Iowa. A series of pre-primary polls showed that Obama enjoyed a significant lead. Clinton was coming second, and John Edwards third. Average polling {{during the period of}} January 5 to January 7, 2008 by Real Clear Politics indicated Obama's support at 38.3%, Clinton at 30.0%, Edwards at 18.3%, and Richardson at 5.7%.

25|$|On the June 25, 2010, {{episode of}} SmackDown, Rodríguez {{appeared}} on a taped promotional video as the unmasked Alberto Del Rio. Thereafter, a vignette aired every week on SmackDown promoting his character as an arrogant rich Mexican aristocrat, espousing his own virtues of honesty, integrity and mental faculties. After two months, Del Rio wrestled his first match at a house show in Brisbane, Australia and a week later, he made his television debut on the August 20 episode of SmackDown by defeating Rey Mysterio in the main event by submission with the cross armbreaker. As part of his act, Del Rio made his entrances in an expensive car, while he was introduced by his personal ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez. The following week, Del Rio continued the storyline with Mysterio by attacking him after his match with Kane, giving him a storyline injury by refusing to relinquish his armbar. Two weeks later, he defeated Matt Hardy via submission in Hardy's last appearance with the company causing Hardy's friend Christian to challenge Del Rio to a match at Night of Champions. Despite declining the match, on the September 24 episode of SmackDown Del Rio attacked Christian and injured him <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> did Mysterio the previous month. This was done to write Christian off television, as he had suffered a torn pectoral muscle. Mysterio returned on the October 8 episode of SmackDown, and handed Del Rio his first defeat in the main event match. In October, Del Rio defeated Chris Masters to represent the SmackDown brand at Bragging Rights, but during the pay-per-view event, he attacked teammate Rey Mysterio, before being eliminated from the match by Team Raw's CM Punk. At Survivor Series, in the traditional five-on-five elimination match, Del Rio captained a team against Rey Mysterio's team. Despite Del Rio's team losing, he {{was removed from the}} match after Big Show knocked him out with a WMD. On the November 26 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Big Show via countout to qualify for the 2010 King of the Ring tournament. In the tournament the next week on Raw, he made United States Champion Daniel Bryan submit in the first round, but was defeated by John Morrison in the semifinal after being distracted by Mysterio who was inside his car. At , Del Rio competed in a fatal four-way Tables, Ladders and Chairs match for the World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Edge and also included Kane and Rey Mysterio. On the January 7, 2011 episode of SmackDown, Del Rio defeated Mysterio in a two-out-of-three-falls match, with help from Ricardo Rodriguez by holding Mysterio out of the ring to end his long feud with Mysterio.|$|E
