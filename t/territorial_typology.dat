40|$|The {{present study}} deals with {{different}} kinds of spatial relations of the Egyptian Elite of the New Kingdom, which can be subsumed and characterized under the term territoriality. The time span of the New Kingdom (ca. 1550 - 1070 BC) and its political situation and historical development form the cultural back­cloth of the monograph to follow. Before entering into the descriptive and analytical part of the study, which focuses on the textual discourse, the prosopographical documentation and the archaeological record of the Egyptian Elite under a territorial perspective, a theoretical discussion of the three terms essential for this study – elite, territoriality, and space – is held. After the theoretical introduction, the study is divided into the three main sections III, IV and V. Part III deals with the textual discourse of the elite, which is examined in great detail to discern the different spatial relations expressed in the so-called (auto-) biographical texts, epithets and offering formulae. Part IV takes the problem of geographical provenance and its {{different kinds of}} expression into account, a central aspect of territoriality. The historical contextualisation of how origin and descent are verbalised in Ancient Egyptian texts shows {{that this was not}} a widespread category of identity at all. But its existence in certain moments and circumstances indicates that it definitely had a specific meaning. Part V aims at establishing a contrastive <b>territorial</b> <b>typology</b> of two socially and functionally differentiated groups of people, the so-called 'viziers' and 'mayors of town'. The backbone of this endeavour is constituted by the collected prosopographical dossiers of these people incorporating all kinds of archaeological and inscriptional evidence. The available data on the viziers and mayors of the New Kingdom is studied from different perspectives. First, the functional agenda of both groups is characterized on the basis of official texts to determine the basic territorial relations in administrative terms. The social milieu of origin and recruitment of viziers and mayors, as well as their different titles, epithets, (auto-) biographical texts, official residences, and statues plus stelae are then taken into consideration to explicate the individual territorial relations which form the basis for a general picture on territoriality and spatial identity of both groups...|$|E
40|$|The thesis work on {{the themes}} of the Green Economy, {{entitled}} 'Green Economy: geographical dimension and perspectives', aims to analyze the opportunities of territorial development represented by the green economy. Starting from {{the analysis of the}} National, European and international literature, the thesis work puts the green economy in relation to the EU energy policy, the Europe 2020 Strategy and cohesion policy, assessing the coherence, support and opportunities that it will arise. Transition into a new economic model requires also an evolution of the implementation tools and policy evaluation. The opportunities from green economy were measured through a careful selection/construction of indicators of climate change, energy risk and energy potential, quality of life, and more traditional economic indicators. Resorting to a model of Territorial Impact Assessment (STeMA, Prezioso 2001), the thesis measure the impacts that policy choices have on the different <b>territorial</b> <b>typologies</b> of Sardinia Region. The study evidenced that the potential of the green economy can’t be implemented indistinctly in the case study chosen because of regional differences, social and economic in the area. </br...|$|R
30|$|The {{review of}} {{academic}} literature {{referred to the}} wheat to bread chain is developed according to a systematic approach (Fink, 2014; Pfau et al., 2014). To this end, we created suitable strings by combining each attribute (and synonyms) with the terms “bread”, “wheat” “soft wheat” and integrated results from Scopus, Ageconsearch and Google Scholar databases. The search was performed in September 2014. We selected 92 references based on the pertinence and relevance with respect to each attribute. This allowed framing the most critical issues emerging in the wheat to bread supply chain for each attribute (see Gava et al., 2014 for a review). In the second step, we identified two wheat to bread chains differentiated {{on the basis of}} four key criteria drawn from academic literature to distinguish between global and local food chains: i) the physical/geographical distance between production and consumption (i.e. the food miles concept, Pretty et al., 2005; Hogan and Thorpe, 2009). This is a primary distinction, with emphasis on the place of cultivation of wheat with respect to milling and baking and consumption. ii) The type of governance and organization of the supply chain, in particular the degree of control on the chain exerted by “local actors” vs “global actors” (Marsden, 2000; Ménard and Valceschini 2005; Gellynck and Molnár 2009). iii) The type of resources, knowledge and technologies employed (Wiskerke, 2003), in particular the technology used for flour milling and baking technique. Also the ingredients and the complexity of the recipe often discriminate among industrial and artisanal breads. iv) The way supply chain actors shape product identity with regard to territory of reference: quality attributes of bread vary in relation to <b>territorial</b> <b>typologies,</b> traditions, local culture (Marsden and Smith, 2005; Tregear, et al., 2007, Barham and Sylvander 2011). The selected case studies were then analysed on the basis on in-depth interviews with stakeholders at each step of the chain (agricultural production, storage, milling, baking and retailing), and integrated with secondary data readily available (i.e. company reports, newspapers, websites).|$|R
40|$|The chapter’s aim is {{to explain}} how it is {{possible}} to investigate and to measure `the productive regional capability' of SMFs in Europe. This will be done in light of strategic parameters with regards to the contribution of Economic Geography to the development of new localization models. These might respect aims of cohesion and competitiveness in sustainability (Prezioso, 2008; New Territorial Agenda 2011 and towards 2020). In the following, it will be illustrated how, in the Europe 2020 perspective, the conversion of endogenous resources in social, economic and territorial development opportunities is demanded trough the development of regional production patterns, in order to obtain smart growth, sustainable development, social inclusion. Lisbon Strategy (2000, 2009 a), as well as the Gothenburg Strategy (2001), represent the start-up of this new approach. They have anticipated Europe 2020 goals (2010) and the renowned Territorial Agenda (2011), directing the entrepreneurships and regions’ strategy to reach both the capability to be competitiveness in sustainability, and more co-operation and cohesion (economic, social, territorial and environmental) (V Cohesion Report, 2010). As in the past, Economic Geography contributes to elaborate theories and models, that include these policy goals. The new researches in this field, overtaking the concept of geographical space (understood as indifferent and homogenous place), introduce territory (understood as a relationships’ system between environmental, social and economic components) as fundamental variable for each policy, localisation and planning choice. This has permitted to up-load old and traditional models (see agglomeration and localization theories and Porter’s Diamond), addedding new parameters to the governance’s rules in the enterprise behavior (Par. 1 and 3). In order to orient concretely the reader in the regional behavior and values, some territorialised performance of enterprise systems and networks will be presented as examples, constructed regarding specific European <b>territorial</b> <b>typologies</b> and using quali-quantitative statistical indicators,. The innovative methodology that has generated these evidences: STeMA (Sustainable Territorial economic/environmental Management Approach) (Par. 1) and its governance process (Par. 3) with regard to the territorial dimension, take account the process of the organization and coordination of actors to develop regional capital. In order to better understand new aims of the entrepreneurships and regional development, the reader will be shortly introduced to the study of: territorial organisation and dynamic, its different forms, and its transformation in place and time. In this approach, very important is the territorial capital that include socio-economic, cultural, historical and environmental heritage as specific and characteristic components of places (Par. 2). Finally, some words are dedicated to the assessment process of the territorial entrepreneurship and the regional sustainable development in competitiveness; and to how decision makers, using STeMA, can simulate an ex ante and ex post scenarios to reduce negative effects of their policy choice for a specific territorial contest and on the base of regional differences and potential. In order to obtain these new economic and external advantages, some appropriated policy recommendations are suggested in main fields of the regional productivity (Par. 4). The chapter follows an multidisciplinary and integrated approach using the principal results of geographical and managerial researches to help i) scholars for adopting flexible and integrated competences and credits and regional stakeholders and decision makers for adopting an enterprise and entrepreneurship vision thought the sustainability...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the first}} explorations of causewayed enclosures, archaeologists have {{attempted}} to define these early Neolithic monuments in relation to <b>territorial</b> patterns, pottery <b>typologies,</b> and ultimately though the concept of structured deposition. While these concepts have been important in advancing our knowledge of causewayed enclosures, the interpretations of the material from the enclosures ditch segments and other areas of these sites have failed {{to take into account}} the importance of how objects and materials came to be at the sites, were produced and used there, preceding deposition. This thesis argues that activities at enclosures should not be categorically separated from the everyday activities of those who visited the enclosures. I argue that by looking in detail at the spatial and temporal distribution of objects in association with chronology that the practical activities people engaged in at enclosures have been overshadowed by interpretations stressing the ritual nature of structured deposits. These activities had a direct relationship with enclosures and local landscapes. This argues that perhaps more deposits within causewayed enclosures were the result of everyday activities which occurred while people gathered at these sites and not necessarily the result of a ‘ritual’ act. A re-interpretation of the detail from nine causewayed enclosures within three ‘regions’ of the British Isles (East Anglia, Sussex and Wessex) will be examined. It will be shown that this theoretical approach to activity goes beyond the deposition of objects and also includes enclosure construction, object modification such as flint knapping, animal butchery, and the use of pottery and wood. On a micro scale this indicates that each community who constructed an enclosure deposited objects in a unique and ‘personal’ manner which was acceptable within their defined social system. On a macro scale, this indicates that although all British causewayed enclosures seem to ‘function’ in the same way, the individual sites were constructed, modified and used in distinctive ways. Some enclosures seem to have existed quite independently from their neighbours while other enclosures within close proximity to each other had a specialised role to play. These specialised roles indicate that some enclosures may have been constructed and used by groups who primarily came to them in order to carry out a specific set of activities which were then defined through deposition.

40|$|The cross-thematic ESPON 3. 3 project (2004 - 2006), named Territorial {{dimension}} of the Lisbon/Gothenburg Strategy, was oriented and developed to obtain several goals: - to apply the update Lisbon/Gothenburg Strategy at territorial dimension, for developing them by new Structural Funds 2007 - 2013; - to conduce ex ante analysis of the impacts of these strategies {{in order to develop}} the EU national and regional competitiveness in a sustainable way; - to introduce territorial cohesion to the Lisbon/Gothenburg Strategy, indicating ways of integrating the Lisbon/Gothenburg Strategy in Structural Funds interventions in support of a balanced and cohesive territorial development of the enlarged EU. -	to link national (macro), regional (meso) and sub-regional (micro) territorial dimension; -	to measure the territorial capability to apply the Lisbon/Gothenburg Strategy at national, regional, sub-regional levels; For this and as added value of the project, a simply-user operational procedure to handle the project results (GIS) was developed. The main results were obtained studing several traditional and additional indicators, identified and measured to achieve the final indicators useful to monitor the “spatial” and “territorial” Lisbon/Gothenburg Strategy. The project recommends to take into account at political level this final list (thereafter A-case) to have got a common European regional measure of the territorial capability of applying Lisbon/Gothenburg Strategy. A ‘process’ (SteM Approach, which produces Territorial Impact Assessment – TIA as well as Strategic Environmental Assessment - SEA) was developed too. It can be used to assess the current and future national, regional, sub-regional capability to be competitive in sustainability. The final project proposal was to study four great “determinants” or composite indicators. They were arisen from simple indicators (metadata) included into both revisited and renovated Lisbon Agenda, and the implementation of Gothenburg Strategy (Almunia Document, 2005 and the relative Eurostat update 2005 - 2006). They are: •	Innovation & Research (including ICT, R&D, Innovation, Human capital, Age) •	Global/local interaction (including CT, R&D, Innovation, SMEs, Human capital, Employment, Transport) •	Quality (including SMEs, Human capital, Employment, Climate, Public health, Natural resources, Poverty, Transport, Age) •	Use of resources and funds (including ICT, Innovation, Employment, Human capital, Age, Climate, Public health, Natural resources, Poverty); Territorial cohesion was also introduced to indicate ways of integrating the Lisbon/Gothenburg Strategy into the new Structural Funds. The project start-up could already count on some commonly shared results (see in Table 2) : i) a list of 42 indicators, which are subject to revision every three years; ii) a reduced/short list of 14 indicators (from EU Spring Report, 2004) proposed to arrange a more easily constructible European governance model (2001), based on common statistical indicators reflecting the Lisbon/Gothenburg goals, looking at the social and economic objectives and at the geographical scale of NUTS 1, 2 e 3; iii) in following (March 2005), the Almunia list of 15 indicators. Anyway, a new indicators appropriate selection (in the overall 69, see Table 2) appeared useful in order to: - provide a common basic analysis of European regional results obtained from 2000 to 2004 for supporting and explaining political choices for the period from 2007 to 2013; - suggest some possible integrations with regard to the real and complex differences within and between the old and new EU regions for the full use of the revisited Structural Funds. The TPG point of view in front of 3. 3 project scopes was mainly oriented from: - a critical discussion in front of some scientific and institutional inputs, as e. g. the Kok Final Report, Facing the Challenge. The Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment (November, 2004); - the full sharing of others, as: •	the study Adaptation of Cohesion Policy to the Enlarged Europe and the Lisbon and Gothenburg Objectives by the European Parliament's Committee on regional development (provisional version, January, 2005); •	the Communication from Mr. Almunia (March, 2005) to the Commission Sustainable Development Indicators to monitor the implementation of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy”; They demonstrate why the initial Lisbon proposal based on the 14 synthetic indicators list (2003 - 2004) should not be suitable. To better sustain this “ambitious” thesis, 3. 3 TPG decided to make at the same time two complementary analysis and mapping activities to perform a comparison: •	The first (A) related to the new methodology for the four composite indicators or determinants •	The second (B) based on the short-list of indicators (the 14 “Spring Report” indicators) In this way, the 3. 3 project has offered a concrete and operational answer about how the EU countries (25 + 2 + 2 at NUTs 0), regions (NUTs 2), sub-regional areas (NUTs 3) can achieve the Lisbon/Gothenburg Strategy and territorial cohesion using their regional potentials; and as the regional areas are, which may best benefit from the granting of a co-operative use of the new Structural Funds. The project met these requirements by territorialisation of spatial (statistical) data and building a proposal of cross-thematic co-operative regions, identifying their potentialities in the light of Lisbon/Gothenburg, through ‘bottom-up’ research of the regional and sub-regional qualitative and quantitative values. In order to develop a common co-operative territorial milieu through the use of new Structural Funds, the project proposed an integration of the indicators list with regard to the different <b>territorial</b> dimensions (regional <b>typologies</b> and trans-national areas involved in Interreg III B programmes and projects). In order to 3. 3 project results, the territorialized ones at regional and sub-regional level (at NUTs 2 and 3) from “STeM Approach” and has proposed-built an original base for this territorialisation of the spatial data (statistical data) combining the ESPON Programme typologies (see in following Figs 24 and 25). A more selective and “customised” set of policy recommendations was presented together with scenarios towards the implementation of the Lisbon/Gothenburg Strategy, concerning the different capabilities shown by the territories and their aggregated hypotheses on a co-operative base, to confirm the initial key-message, suggesting general and sectorial policies. By using the STeM Approach and EU TIA input 2005, 3. 3 project has detected: i) 	the national and regional territorial status. It corresponds also at ex ante potential demand for supplying national and regional appropriate operative plans; ii) 	the wished effects applying Lisbon/Gothenburg sectorial policies by Structural Funds; iii) 	the ex post simulation of national and regional changing. This approach was useful “to assess the development potential and territorial imbalance in different trans-national/national territories and types of regions in relation to the objective of Lisbon/Gothenburg Strategy”. The 3. 3 project named this development potential capability to be competitive in sustainability. For this scope, the specific GIS assessment was built, too, as added value of the 3. 3. project. A successful implementation of the Lisbon-Gothenburg strategies depends on differentiated interventions at the macro, meso and micro levels and policy recommendations were proposed accordingly. In addition, the methodology developed in this project has pioneered an approach in which the potential impact of such interventions are assessed in relation to the specificities of each particular region, as opposed simply to the ‘type’ of region. Thus within this revisited Report, recommendations were also differentiated according to the specificity of regions. The summary of the key recommendations arising from 3. 3 project accounted of: - the conclusions of a survey of the entire ESPON programme which identified implicit recommendations related to the delivery of Lisbon-Gothenburg; - a charting of ‘Lisbon and Gothenburg derived policy objectives’ set in relation to the composite indicators within 3. 3 project...|$|R
