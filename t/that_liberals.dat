25|$|Epstein (1972) argues <b>that</b> <b>liberals</b> were {{especially}} fascinated by Buckley, and often wanted to debate him, {{in part because}} his ideas resembled their own, for Buckley typically formulated his arguments in reaction to left-liberal opinion, rather than being founded on conservative principles that were alien to the liberals.|$|E
25|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the {{incompetence}} of the ruling class in Russia discredited the monarchy and aristocracy. Russia was already reeling from earlier losses to Japan and political struggles with the Kadets, a powerful liberal bloc in the Duma. Facing huge shortages in basic necessities along with widespread riots in early 1917, Czar Nicholas II abdicated in March, bringing to an end three centuries of Romanov rule and paving the way for liberals to declare a republic. Russia's liberals, repeatedly used the slogans, symbols, and ideas of the French Revolution — plastering liberté, égalité, fraternité over major public spaces — to establish an emotional attachment to the past, an attachment <b>that</b> <b>liberals</b> hoped would galvanize the public to fight for modern values.|$|E

25|$|The Reform Party saw the Canadian federal {{government}} as {{led by the}} Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties as being consistently indifferent to Western Canada while focusing too much attention on Eastern Canada (especially Quebec). It noted that the National Energy Program of the 1980s, introduced by a federal Liberal government, involved major government intervention into Canada's energy markets to regulate prices, resulting in economic losses to Alberta and benefits to Eastern Canada. It also cited the 1986 decision by a federal Progressive Conservative government to contract the construction of CF-18 military aircraft to an unprepared contractor in Quebec rather than a ready contractor in Winnipeg, Manitoba. To Reformers, these events served as evidence <b>that</b> <b>Liberals</b> and Progressive Conservatives consistently favoured Eastern Canada {{at the expense of}} Western Canada.|$|E
500|$|Most {{predictions}} had the Tories {{picking up}} seats, but the Liberals maintaining a majority. The New York Times reported <b>that</b> <b>Liberals</b> expected {{to lose a}} majority of Ontario's seats, but retain a narrow majority in the House of Commons. Time magazine predicted a Tory gain of 20 to 40seats and stated that any result which denied the Liberals 133seats and a majority [...] "would rank as a major upset". Beck indicates that many journalists, including those sympathetic to the Tories, saw signs of the coming upset, but disregarded them, convinced {{that the government was}} invulnerable. Maclean's, which printed its postelection issue before the election to go on sale the morning after, ran an editorial noting that Canadians had freely chosen to reelect the Liberal Party.|$|E
500|$|During the Red Scare of 1947–1957, {{agitators}} of the American {{secular and}} Christian right, {{influenced by the}} work of Canadian conspiracy theorist William Guy Carr, increasingly embraced and spread unfounded fears of Freemasons, Illuminati and Jews as the alleged driving forces behind an [...] "international communist conspiracy". The threat of [...] "Godless communism", {{in the form of a}} state atheistic and bureaucratic collectivist world government, demonized as the [...] "Red Menace", therefore became the focus of apocalyptic millenarian conspiracism. The Red Scare came to shape one of the core ideas of the political right in the United States, which is <b>that</b> <b>liberals</b> and progressives, with their welfare-state policies and international cooperation programs such as foreign aid, supposedly contribute to a gradual process of collectivism that will inevitably lead to nations being replaced with a communist one-world government.|$|E

500|$|Less than a {{week after}} the election, Douglas wrote to one of her {{supporters}} that she did not think there was anything her campaign could have done to change the result. Blaming the war, voter mistrust of Truman's foreign policy, and high prices at home, Douglas stated that she lost in California because Nixon was able to take {{a large part of the}} women's vote and the labor vote. Later in November, she indicated <b>that</b> <b>liberals</b> must undertake a massive effort to win in 1952. In 1956, she stated in an interview that, while Nixon had never called her a communist, he had designed his whole campaign to create the impression that she was a communist or [...] "communistic". In 1959, she wrote that she had not particularly wanted to be a senator, and in 1962 she stated that the policy of her campaign was to avoid attacks on Nixon. In her memoirs, published posthumously in 1982, she wrote, [...] "Nixon had his victory, but I had mine... He hadn't touched me. I didn't carry Richard Nixon with me, thank God." [...] She concluded her chapter on the 1950 race with, [...] "There's not much to say about the 1950 campaign except that a man ran for Senate who wanted to get there, and didn't care how." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{chair of}} the McGovern–Fraser Commission in 1969–70, McGovern instituted major changes in Democratic party rules that {{continue}} to this day and, to a large degree, were ultimately adopted by the Republican Party as well, with large institutional {{changes taking place in}} both. Among those was the centralization of decisions about the nominating process at the national party level, rather than with the states. His 1972 campaign fundamentally altered how presidential primary campaigns were waged. Within the Democratic Party, power shifted from the New Deal coalition to younger, more affluent, issue-oriented activists; the women's movement and gay rights movement found a place; skepticism about military buildups and foreign interventions took hold; and the 1960s [...] "New Politics" [...] found its culmination in McGovern's nomination. In turn, the overwhelming defeat of McGovern in the general election led to the liberal wing of the party's being stigmatized for decades to come and a turn in the party towards centrist directions. McGovern himself recognized the mixed results of his 1972 candidacy, saying, [...] "We made a serious effort to open the doors of the Democratic Party – and as soon as we did, half the Democrats walked out." [...] SUNY Albany political scientist Bruce Miroff wrote in 2007 that the McGovern campaign was the last time in presidential politics <b>that</b> <b>liberals</b> had [...] "their chance to speak of their goals with enthusiasm and their dreams with fire... Yet almost at the instant that the insurgents successfully stormed the heights of American politics, they found themselves on the brink of one of the worst free falls on record." ...|$|E

40|$|Liberal egalitarianism {{has been}} criticized for paying {{insufficient}} attention to what justice requires for the institutions that structure economic production. In the light of such criticism, this paper investigates arguments <b>that</b> <b>liberal</b> egalitarians might give for the kinds of institutional reforms that critics have proposed. These reforms include (1) guarantees for meaningful work, (2) worker participation in the governance of economic enterprises, and (3) democratic participation in the control of the means of production at the level of society. The paper argues <b>that</b> <b>liberal</b> egalitarianism has much to say not only about questions regarding distribution, but also about questions regarding production...|$|R
2500|$|Coulter opposes {{same-sex}} marriage and once supported a federal U.S. constitutional amendment defining {{marriage as a}} union of one man and one woman.

2500|$|The Republican Party {{recovered}} from the 1964 election debacle, picking up 47 seats in the House of Representatives in the 1966 mid-term election. Further Republican successes ensued, including Goldwater's return to the Senate in 1969. In January of that year, Goldwater wrote {{an article in the}} National Review [...] "affirming that he [...] not against liberals, <b>that</b> <b>liberals</b> are needed as a counterweight to conservatism, and that he had in mind a fine liberal like Max Lerner".|$|E

Yet one teenager's science project at the Southern Appalachian Science and Engineering Fair, and a favorite of the fair's coordinator, was a survey concluding <b>that</b> <b>liberals</b> roll over while conservatives roll under.|$|E
40|$|Alan Patten’s Equal Recognition {{is a major}} {{contribution}} to the normative literature on minority rights.

In addition, I submit that Patten did not supply a fully convincing answer to the argument <b>that</b> <b>liberal</b> egalitarianism, well understood, is capacious enough to secure fair terms of social cooperation for members of cultural minorities, making the (allegedly burdensome) language of “cultural rights” and “cultural recognition” superfluous...|$|R

2500|$|Campaign finance expert Jan Baran, {{a member}} of the Commission on Federal Ethics Law Reform, agreed with the decision, writing that [...] "The history of {{campaign}} finance reform is the history of incumbent politicians seeking to muzzle speakers, any speakers, particularly those who might publicly criticize them and their legislation. It is a lot easier to legislate against unions, gun owners, 'fat cat' bankers, health insurance companies and any other industry or 'special interest' group when they can't talk back." [...] Baran further noted that in general conservatives and libertarians praised the ruling's preservation of the First Amendment and freedom of speech, but <b>that</b> <b>liberals</b> and campaign finance reformers criticized it as greatly expanding the role of corporate money in politics.|$|E
2500|$|Social democracy, an {{ideology}} advocating progressive modification of capitalism, {{emerged in the}} 20th century and was influenced by socialism. Yet unlike socialism, it was not collectivist nor anti-capitalist. Broadly defined as a project that aims to correct, through government reformism, what it regards as the intrinsic defects of capitalism by reducing inequalities, social democracy was also not against the state. Several commentators have noted strong similarities between social liberalism and social democracy, with one political scientist even calling American liberalism [...] "bootleg social democracy" [...] due {{to the absence of}} a significant social democratic tradition in the United States <b>that</b> <b>liberals</b> have tried to rectify. Another movement associated with modern democracy, Christian democracy, hopes to spread Catholic social ideas and has gained a large following in some European nations. The early roots of Christian democracy developed as a reaction against the industrialisation and urbanisation associated with laissez-faire liberalism in the 19th century. Despite these complex relationships, some scholars have argued that liberalism actually [...] "rejects ideological thinking" [...] altogether, largely because such thinking could lead to unrealistic expectations for human society.|$|E
2500|$|A 2005 Pew Research Center {{study found}} <b>that</b> <b>liberals</b> {{were the most}} educated ideological {{demographic}} and were tied with the conservative sub-group the [...] "enterprisers" [...] for the most affluent group. Of those who identified as liberal, 49% were college graduates and 41% had household incomes exceeding $75,000, compared to 27% and 28% as the national average, respectively. Liberalism has become the dominant political ideology in academia, with 44-62% identifying as liberal, depending on the exact wording of the survey. This compares with 40-46% liberal identification in surveys from 1969 to 1984. The social sciences and humanities were most liberal, whereas business and engineering departments were the least liberal, though even in the business departments, liberals outnumbered conservatives by two to one. This feeds the common question whether liberals, on average, are more educated than their political counterparts––conservatives. Two Zogby surveys from 2008 and 2010 indeed affirm that self-identified liberals tend {{to go to college}} more than self-identified conservatives. Polls have found that young Americans are considerably more liberal than the general population. As of 2009, 30% of the 18-29 cohort was liberal. In 2011, this had changed to 28%, with moderates picking up the two percent.|$|E
