The first phase of repairs to the adjacent Housatonic River Railroad Bridge over the Housatonic River prevented Waterbury Branch trains from accessing the normal transfer point at Bridgeport, necessitating the <b>temporary</b> <b>transfer</b> station. The Devon Transfer station was re-activated in 2016 from April until October to accommodate additional repairs and catenary wire work.|$|E
50|$|In {{a number}} of situations, an NFA item may be {{transferred}} without a transfer tax. These include sales to government agencies, <b>temporary</b> <b>transfers</b> of an NFA firearm to a gunsmith for repairs, and transfer of an NFA firearm to a lawful heir {{after the death of}} its owner. A permanent transfer, even if tax-free, must be approved by ATF. The proper form should be submitted to ATF before the transfer occurs. For example, lawful heirs must submit a Form 5 and wait for approval before taking possession of any NFA item willed to them. <b>Temporary</b> <b>transfers,</b> such as those to a gunsmith or to the original manufacturer for repair, are not subject to ATF approval since they are not legally considered transfers. ATF does, however, recommend filing tax-free transfer paperwork on all such <b>temporary</b> <b>transfers,</b> to confer an extra layer of legal protection on both the owner and the gunsmith.|$|R

25|$|Where an {{entitlement}} {{is able to}} be traded, the transaction may take several forms including <b>temporary</b> <b>transfer</b> of a seasonal water assignment, a permanent transfer of {{all or part of}} a water entitlement or a lease over a set period of years. All transfers require approval from the various regulatory bodies to ensure it complies with trading rules designed to meet environmental and in some cases socio-economic objectives. Such rules may include approving trades only within a set zone or the exchange rate of trades between zones to reflect water losses in delivery or differences in reliability.|$|E
25|$|A common {{reason for}} the active partner to tie up their partner is so both may gain {{pleasure}} from the restrained partner's submission and {{the feeling of the}} <b>temporary</b> <b>transfer</b> of control and power. For sadomasochistic people, bondage is often used as a means to an end, where the restrained partner is more accessible to other sadomasochistic behaviour. However, bondage can also be used for its own sake. The restrained partner can derive sensual pleasure from the feeling of helplessness and immobility, and the active partner can derive visual pleasure and satisfaction from seeing their partner tied up.|$|E
25|$|The {{two governments}} signed the Edinburgh Agreement, which {{allowed for the}} <b>temporary</b> <b>transfer</b> of legal authority. In {{accordance}} with the Edinburgh Agreement, the UK government drafted an Order in Council granting the Scottish Parliament the necessary powers to hold, on or before 31 December 2014, an independence referendum. The draft Order was approved by resolutions of both Houses of Parliament, and the Order, titled The Scotland Act 1998 (Modification of Schedule 5) Order 2013, was approved by Queen Elizabeth II, following the advice of Her Ministers, {{at a meeting of}} the Privy Council on 12 February 2013. Under the powers temporarily transferred from Westminster under the section 30 Order, the Scottish Parliament adopted the Scottish Independence Referendum Act 2013, summoning the referendum, defining the question to be asked, giving the date on which the referendum was to be held, and establishing the rules governing the holding of the referendum. The Bill for the Act was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 14 November 2013 and received Royal Assent on 17 December 2013. Under section 36 of the Act, it came into force the day after Royal Assent.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses data {{collected}} in Thailand among permanent rural-urban migrants to analyse the motivations in land <b>temporary</b> <b>transfers</b> such as free loans or rentals. Land transfers are here {{looked at in}} a continuum and categorized according to three characteristics: {{the nature of the}} relationship between the parties of the exchange, the monetary nature of the payment as well as its explicit or imlicit nature. This methodology allows a richer typology than traditionnally used in empiric literature, and distinguishes between various loans that are not always free. The empiricalresults show that land loans are frequently chosen by households who rely heavily on traditional risk-sharing networks and credit land with a high safety net value. Morevore, the statistical analysis reveal the significance of hybrid transfers such as disguised rental, that combine both rent-seeking and risk-coping motivations. Overall, the paper underlines the importance of risk-coping motivations in the design of land <b>temporary</b> <b>transfers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Developing Portfolios of Water Supply Transfers Most cities rely on firm {{water supply}} {{capacity}} to meet demand, but increasing scarcity and supply costs are encouraging {{greater use of}} <b>temporary</b> <b>transfers</b> (e. g., spot leases, options). This raises questions regarding how best to coordinate {{the use of these}} transfers in meeting cost and reliability objectives. This work combines a hydrologic-water market simulation with an optimization approach to identify portfolios of permanent rights, options and leases that minimize expected costs of meeting a city’s annual demand with a specified reliability. Spot market prices are linked to hydrologic conditions and described by monthly lease price distributions which are used to price options via a risk neutral approach. Monthly choices regarding when and how much water to acquire through <b>temporary</b> <b>transfers</b> are {{made on the basis of}} anticipatory decision rules related to the ratio of expected supply-to-expected demand.

2500|$|The IND {{mezzanine}} {{has opened}} in various phases. Around August 2011, the William Street {{end of the}} Eastern mezzanine opened, coinciding {{with the opening of}} the 135 William Street entrance. In October 2011, due to a major realignment of the <b>temporary</b> <b>transfer</b> passageway between the [...] and [...] stations, parts of the Western Mezzanine opened as well. The realignment sent passengers through the construction site of the Fulton Building, a practice that has still continued with the uptown [...] trains. By January 2012, the Western Mezzanine had opened to the Jamaica-bound [...] platforms. In June 2012, an underpass under the [...] platforms re-opened and became connected to the Western Mezzanine. It travels approximately under Fulton Street. With the opening of the new passageway, the older underpass connecting to southbound [...] platform was simultaneously closed. As a result, the Western Mezzanine is substantially completed. A white false wall separates the work area (transit center building) from the now-public passageways is put up in the Western Mezzanine. On August 2, 2012, almost a year since the new entrance on William Street opened, the Broad Street-bound [...] platform became connected to the Eastern Mezzanine. MTA officials have regarded this as the substantial completion of the entire IND mezzanine. However, contract work is still being undertaken in both the eastern and western halves; five new elevators linking the [...] platform and the mezzanine halves, and the two escalators connecting to William Street, were put into service by December 2012.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} both permanent and <b>temporary</b> tied <b>transfers</b> on the growth and macroeconomic performance of a small recipient open economy. We show how there is a sharp contrast in the effects of traditional pure transfers and transfers tied to investment in public infrastructure such as adopted by the European Union in its Structural Funds and Pre-accession aid programs. A permanent pure transfer has no growth or dynamic consequences. It is always welfare-improving, the gains varying positively {{with the size of}} the government, when the stock of debt and the benefits of debt reduction increase. A tied transfer generates dynamic adjustments, as public capital is accumulated in the recipient economy. Its effect on the long-run growth rate, {{and the extent to which}} this is beneficial, depends upon the initial size of the infrastructure in the economy, as well as any co-financing arrangements.
