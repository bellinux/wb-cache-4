Although the modeling of rainfall partitioning by forests has received attention in the past, partitioning caused by crops has been overlooked. The present work proposes a two front experimental and computational methodology to comprehensively study rainfall interception and partitioning by the maize canopy. In the experimental stage, we deployed two compact weather stations, two optical disdrometers, and five <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>rain</b> <b>gauges.</b> Two of the <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> were modified to measure throughfall while two were adapted to measure stemflow. The first optical disdrometer allowed for inspection of the unmodified drop-size and velocity distributions, whereas the second disdrometer measured the corresponding distributions under the canopy. This indicates that {{the outcome of the}} interaction between the hydrometeors and the canopy depends on the drop diameter. In the computational stage, we created a model that uses drop-size and velocity distributions as well as a three-dimensional digital canopy to simulate the movement of raindrops on the surfaces of leaves. Our model considers interception, redirection, retention, coalescence, breakup, and re-interception of drops to calculate the stemflow, throughfall, and equivalent height of precipitation stored on plants for a given storm. Moreover, the throughfall results are presented as two-dimensional matrices, where each term corresponds to the accumulated volume of drops that dripped at a given location. This allows insight into the spatial distribution of throughfall beneath the foliage. Finally, we examine {{the way in which the}} maize canopy modifies the drop-size distribution by recalculating the drop velocity based on the raindrop 2 ̆ 7 s size and detachment height and by storing the counts of drops in diameter-velocity classes that are consistent with the classes used by disdrometers in the experimental study...|$|R

Theirs spatial and temporal variability is significant and covers large scales. These precipitation properties induce a very strong constraint on the measurement, which must be as continuous as possible, both in time and in space.. In particular, studies of climate change need high-resolution rainfall with resolutions much higher than 1 hour to obtain statistics of extrem rainfall and wet and dry spell duration. For all these reasons, several instruments were used for the observation of precipitations, of which the <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> is the oldest and the most commonly used for the precipitations in-situ measurements.

It records Strong storm events sometimes but its precipitations are dominated by low rainfall. Eight year time series observed with a disdrometer and different rain gauges located on the French Atmospheric Research Observatory (SIRTA), are used. Simulated <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>rain</b> <b>gauge</b> series for different tipping bucket volumes and weighting rain gauge series for different weights as precision are performed. The purpose of the simulation was to ignore other effects (evapora- tion, spatial variability...). The simulated series are compared to the observed ones (PDF,CDF, rain peak intensity, occurrence, amount, duration, intensity...) to validate the simulation process. Then, using the simulated series we first studied the two effects of 1 -the tipping bucket volumes(resp. weights precision) and 2 -the time resolution on precipitations characteristics (occurrence, standard-derivation, rain peak intensity, amount, duration, intensity, [...] .). Secondly we proposed a method to identify the best time resolution for a used tipping bucket volumes (resp. weights precision). C) As an example, for integration time of one hour a corresponding tipping bucket of 0. 15 mm is necessary while a weight precision of 0. 01 mm is necessary if a 6 min time resolution is used. The relationship between the tipping bucket volumes and the minimal integration time is climatic dependent.

For example, the integration time for the Weathertronics rain gauge is given by delta(T) = 15. 24 /R (min), where R is the rain rate expressed in mm/h and delta(T) is the time between tips expressed in minutes. It is apparent that a rain rate of 1 mm/h has an integration time in excess of 15 minutes. Rain rates larger than 15. 24 mm/h will have integration times smaller than 1 minute. The integration time is dictated {{by the time it}} takes to fill a small tipping bucket where each tip gives rise to 0. 254 mm of rainfall.

ROCSAT- 1 is the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite with a circular orbit at the altitude of 600 km and 35 ° inclination angle and sched-uled to be launched {{at the beginning of}} 1999. Given the extremely high frequency of the beacon, impairment of ROCSAT- 1 communications due to rain attenuation should be seriously considered. In this paper, the ground-based instruments for the Ka band propagation experiments of ROCSAT- 1, including Chung-Li VHF radar, 19. 5 GHz radiometer, optical <b>rain</b> <b>gauge,</b> automatic weather station, and disdrometer, are introduced. The spatial distribution of the long-term statistics of rainfall rate is analyzed in this paper on the basis of 8 years (1988 - 1995) rainfall rate data at one-minute time resolution, recorded by more than 70 <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> dis-tributed over Taiwan island. It shows a pronounced latitudinal variation i...|$|R
40|$|The {{interception}} {{was recognized}} as {{an important part of}} the catchment water balance in temperate climate. The mountainous forest ecosystem at experimental headwater catchment Liz has been subject of long-term monitoring. Unique dataset in terms of time resolution serves to determine canopy storage capacity and free throughfall. Spatial variability of throughfall was studied using one weighing and five <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>rain</b> <b>gauges.</b> The basic characteristics of forest affecting interception process were determined for the Norway spruce stand at the experimental area - the leaf area index was 5. 66 - 6. 00 m 2 m- 2, the basal area was 55. 7 m 2 ha- 1, and the crown closure above individual <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> was between 19 and 95 %. The total interception loss in both growing seasons analyzed was 34. 5 %. The mean value of the interception capacity determined was about 2 mm. Throughfall exhibited high variability from place to place and it was strongly affected by character of rainfall. On the other hand, spatial pattern of throughfall in average showed low variability...|$|R
40|$|The {{characterization}} of rainfall and its extremes at different {{spatial and temporal}} scales {{is important for the}} evaluation of environmental risks along high-speed rail systems. Rainfall can induce accidents for example through the activation of landslides and affects operations by causing slowdown. We present an exploratory analysis of point rainfall data from mainland Portugal, distributed over an area of approximately 30 km by 460 km. This corridor includes the high-speed rail track that is now being designed for Portugal. This {{is the first step in}} the assessment of hydrologic risk for this infrastructure. The dataset includes rainfall time series with heterogeneous length and resolution: some of the data are from <b>tipping</b> <b>bucket</b> <b>rain</b> <b>gauges</b> with hourly resolution and an average length of 5 years, while others are from conventional gauges with daily data over periods of more than 50 years. Key statistical characteristics of the rainfall process, including extremes, are investigated to increase our understanding of the variability of the rainfall climate along the rail track. Maps showing the areal distribution of statistical characteristics of the process are drawn to better illustrate the spatial variability of the rainfall threat in the study area...|$|R
