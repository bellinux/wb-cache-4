40|$|This Article {{examines}} the intersection between territory and constitutional liberty. Territoriality, {{as defined by}} Robert Sack, is the attempt to affect, influence, or control people, phenomena, and relationships by delimiting and asserting control over a geographic area. Territoriality affects constitutional liberty in profound ways. These effects have been apparent in certain infamous historical episodes, including the territoriality of racial segregation, the geographic exclusion and internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, early state migratory exclusions, and isolation of the sick and mentally ill. Today, governments are resorting to territorial restrictions in {{an increasing number of}} circumstances, including detention of enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay, attempted expulsion of illegal immigrants from local communities, banishment of convicted sex offenders from vast geographic areas, exclusion of homeless persons from public spaces, and proposed isolation and quarantine of victims of pandemics and bio-terrorist attacks. These and other measures have produced what the Article refers to as Geographies of Justice, Membership, Punishment, Purification, and Contagion. Within these geographies, persons and groups are subject to constitutional displacement-the <b>territorial</b> <b>restriction</b> or denial of fundamental liberties. The displacements examined in the Article substantially restrict or deny basic liberties including access to justice, migration, movement, communal and political membership, and the ability to be present in places of one 2 ̆ 7 s own choosing. The Article demonstrates that the Constitution provides less than robust protection from certain forms of territorial displacement. Analyzing the Constitution itself as a spatial framework, one that relies upon place, geography, and territory for various purposes, the Article shows that displacement arises from extraterritorial and intra-territorial 2 ̆ 2 spatial gaps 2 ̆ 2 in text and structure.

40|$|Abstract: We review {{explanations}} for two controversial vertical restraints {{commonly used in}} gasoline marketing: price zones and <b>territorial</b> <b>restrictions.</b> After {{a discussion of the}} relevant empirical and theoretical economics literature, we consider procompetitive and anticompetitive theories behind the practices. Price zones may be one part of a complicated relationship between gasoline marketers and retailers that facilitates efficient risk-sharing, provides optimal incentives for marketers and retailers, and allows marketers to react more quickly to changes in localized retail competition. Alternatively, if gasoline marketers have substantial market power, price zones may facilitate coordination or help deter entry. <b>Territorial</b> <b>restrictions</b> may prevent inefficiencies in distribution and reduce free-riding on investments marketers make in developing networks of retail stations. At the same time, <b>territorial</b> <b>restrictions</b> help marketers maintain price zones (with the same welfare implications), and may, if marketers have substantial market power, facilitate coordination.

40|$|<b>Territorial</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{long have}} been the subject of intense policy debate. The central issue in this debate has been whether such {{distribution}} arrangements are deployed tor efficiency or anticompetitive purposes. The authors add to the debate by broadening the existing conceptualization ot business efficiency and providing evidence of the im-portance of efficiency considerations in the decision to deploy restrictions. In the past, efficiency often has been viewed narrowly, in terms of giving distributors incentives to provide free-rideable services. The authors show that information asymmetry and transaction costs also represent important efficiency-based explanations of <b>territorial</b> <b>restrictions.</b> With regard to anticompetitive concerns, their results show that manufacturers are more likely to use <b>territorial</b> <b>restrictions</b> when they face competition ex ante. Ultimately this may reduce interbrand competition. From a public policy perspective, their pattern of results supports the current rule of reason treatment of territorial re-strictions in the United States. At the same time it questions the current European policy of per se illegality. M arketing decisions are often the focus of regulationand public policy debate. Marketers have a longtradition of informing the public policy discussion in these areas with unique knowledge of current practices, theories, and data. For example, the debates on predatory pricing (Guiltinan and Gundlach 1996), product liability (Morgan 1982; Sheffet 1983), gray market activity (Cross, Stephans, and Benjamin 1990; Duhan and Sheffet 1988), and advertising to children (Goldberg 1990; Pollay et al. 1996; Roedder, Sternthal, and Calder 1983) have all bene-fited from research in marketing. One area of public policy in which marketing has con-tributed less is that of vertical restrictions. The particular fo-cus of this research is on <b>territorial</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Such restrictions, which are initiated by a manufacturer, assign distributors to a particular geographical area or sales territo-ry with the objective of restricting intrabrand competition (Cady 1982; Katz 1989; U.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} and analyse the significance of economic thinking and arguments {{in the treatment of}} licence agreements in EC competition law. A central question is to what degree the concept of competition in EC law reflects an economically realistic approach to competition. The study also investigates to what degree the economic functioning of intellectual property is considered in competition regulation and how much the economic functioning of the licence agreement is considered. The investigation mainly consists of a comparative analysis of EC competition law and American antitrust law concerning the economic arguments and their importance. The treatment of <b>territorial</b> <b>restrictions,</b> field of use restrictions, quantity clauses, tie-outs, tie-ins, grant back, no-challenge clauses and price restrictions are of special interest here. This study shows that an economically realistic view of competition has influenced current EC competition law, especially in the Technology Transfer Block Exemption Regulation (TTBER). Exceptions from this development in the EC law are mainly due to the goal of integration of the common market. <b>Territorial</b> <b>restrictions</b> are strictly regulated in the TTBER even when the parties’ market shares are below the market thresholds defined in the regulation. The function of intellectual property rights are not much considered in EC competition law but there are general remarks about the economic functioning of patents in the Guidelines for the TTBER. However, it is difficult to find evidence for economic reasoning about patents in the formation of concrete rules. On the contrary, patents are weakened by the widened concept of exhaustion presented in the Guidelines. The economic functioning of the licence agreement is considered in the rules of TTBER and the economic arguments for clauses which create incentives for making investments or give the possibility of control are acknowledged. However, the free riding argument has a weak position when applied to <b>territorial</b> <b>restrictions,</b> which are more formalistically regulated. The EC competition law has become more similar to American antitrust law. The decisive difference consists in the judicial treatment of <b>territorial</b> <b>restrictions,</b> where the goal of integration is still of central importance in EC law...|$|R

40|$|Both {{geographic}} and normative constraints restrict access to surrogate {{international human rights}} protection for those seeking a haven from serious human rights abuses.

40|$|This article {{presents}} evidence that team owners in Major League Baseball (MLB) set ticket prices as profit-maximizing monopolists. However, the evidence {{also indicates that}} the cost of other forms of entertainment affects the demand for baseball tickets as economic theory would predict.

The impact, however, is inconsistent with the hypothesis that it enhanced the team owners' market power. Instead, the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the change increased the demand for baseball tickets.

This argument merits additional consideration in future research and may provide some insight into how nonprice vertical restraints in other markets affect economic performance.

He stated that the court's opinion represented only [...] "one possible reading of the trial record, which can be read to reach a different result." [...] In his view:A review of the record reveals that serious anticompetitive problems existed with the Westinghouse-Mitsubishi licenses. At {{the time of the}} trial, the agreements between the two multi-billion-dollar international enterprises in the highly concentrated international electrical equipment industry were over fifty years old. They covered know-how as well as patent transfers. The licenses covered virtually all of their electrical product lines (hundreds of products), and prevented each company from competing in the other's home market. The license also did not detail the specific patents held by each company that would have ostensibly blocked entry into the market of the other country. The combination of such a broad cross-license, in which the property is not clearly described, with <b>territorial</b> <b>restrictions,</b> for such an extended period, would suggest that much of the licenses' technology, whether patent or know-how, is of little value and that the purpose and effect of the licenses is to restrict potential competition rather than to share technology.|$|R

The International Shoe framework conditions the exercise of personal jurisdiction on a geographic nexus between a nonresident defendant and the forum state.

This Note will argue that the proper means of resolving the disjunction between International Shoe and cybersquatting lies with Congress, rather than the federal courts.

40|$|This book {{explores the}} {{changing}} relationship between Ireland and America {{in the modern}} world. Its main themes examine the shifting patterns of Irish migration over time {{and the implications of}} these changes for the political and cultural relationship between the two countries. The central argument made in the book is that the historic connection between Ireland and America is at a transitional point, and that while Irish-America is not disappearing altogether, it is changing in fundamental ways, mediated by the forces of globalisation and modernity. Conceptually, the book focuses on Irish-America as an evolved diaspora, in the sense of being a migrant community that has moved into the political, economic and cultural mainstream within US society. The eight chapters examine theories of diaspora and migration in the case of Irish- America and bring together interdisciplinary academic literature with new research. A number of important issues {{lie at the heart of}} this book for all of us. Where do we belong? Why do we belong there? Does global modernity allow us to mediate between where we are from and where we live, to transcend <b>territorial</b> <b>restrictions</b> and live our lives beyond, or in between, the country of our birth?

40|$|Many Internet {{users have}} {{encountered}} geoblocking tools – tools that prevent users from accessing certain content on the Internet {{based on the}} location from which the users are connecting to the Internet. Because at least some users want to access such content, they turn to tools {{that enable them to}} evade geoblocking, to appear on the Internet as if they were located in another location, and to access the content that is available in this other location. So far these activities appear to be under the radar of intellectual property (“IP”) owners, perhaps because geoblocking evasion by users for the purposes of accessing IP-protected content can be viewed much like non-infringing de minimis importation in small numbers for non-commercial use (TRIPS, Art. 60). This article points out that there are signs of substantial user desire to access content that is not available in the user’s location; this desire is evidenced, for example, by the recent proliferation of the numbers of and commercial success of space-shifting services that have advertised and/or have been used to access territorially-restricted television content from any place in the world (e. g., ManekiTV, Slingbox). It is possible that with more <b>territorial</b> <b>restrictions</b> imposed on content on the Internet and with courts finding {{at least some of the}} space-shifting services infringing (e. g., TVCatchup, Aereo) users will turn to geoblocking evasion even more than they have already.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis by Jonathan Stern and Katja Yafimava of Gazpromâs March 2017 competition commitments {{in respect of}} gas sales to Central and Eastern Europe, concludes that the concerns expressed by DG COMP in respect of <b>territorial</b> <b>restrictions,</b> pricing, and infrastructure issues have been addressed, both in form and in substance. Acceptance of these commitments would provide insurance against future abuse by Gazprom of its dominant position in these countries. Most importantly, Gazprom has henceforth agreed to charge average weighted import border prices and/or prices at relevant generally accepted liquid hubs in Continental Europe instead of alternative fuel (oil-linked) prices. This means that if the commitments are accepted, buyers in these countries {{will be able to}} buy Russian gas at hub prices before interconnections have been established with these hubs (potentially up to three years hence). The acceptance by Gazprom of competitive, defined as liquid hub, prices has much wider significance, as it signals the end of alternative fuel pricing for gas in EU countries. DG COMPs market test of the commitments elicited a generally positive response with the exception of Polandâs PGNiG which expressed deep dissatisfaction on virtually all issues, in particular the lack of any fine or obligation for Gazprom to pay compensation for its past behaviour. The study suggests that the most likely outcome is the acceptance by DG COMP of the commitments (with minor amendments) and closure of the case with a settlement. Should some member states, specifically Poland, attempt to derail the settlement, causing the case to be referred to the EU Court of Justice (CJEU), the commitments are still likely to be implemented but legal proceedings could drag on for several more years...|$|R
40|$|From the {{perspective}} of the ‘Digital Single Market’ geo-blocking widely frustrates the increasingly high expectations of European citizens to access culture, services and entertainment on a EU-wide basis. Geo-blocking also makes hugely demanded content such as films and TV series inaccessible in a legitimate way, with a consequential rise in appeal of online piracy. This article identifies the barriers raised by such technical restrictions and explains why the licensing of copyright works on a country-by-country basis may still be justified, on objective grounds. It also argues that the current emphasis on geo-blocking solely in relation to copyright is misleading since copyright is not the only reason why the exploitation of creative works (in particular films) is still rigidly territorial in Europe. On the one hand, the need to adapt and make content accessible to Europe’s culturally and linguistically diverse audiences may justify a separate exploitation on a territorial basis. On the other hand, factors such as a persisting digital divide, a different availability of bandwidth across the EU and {{a significant difference in the}} purchasing power of European consumers have a partitioning effect of the Single Market. This article takes the view that a progressive reduction of geo-blocking measures and an effective Europeanization of markets for digital content would urgently require a clarification of the conditions under which <b>territorial</b> <b>restrictions</b> may still be considered as a necessary tool to preserve cultural diversity and the remuneration of opportunities (e. g. advertising) associated with a particular territory.
