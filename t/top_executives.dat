Drawing on social comparison theory, this study examines the relationship between politically connected boards and <b>top</b> <b>executive</b> pay. Moreover, given the socialist orientation of China, tests are also carried out to establish the relationship between politically connected directors and pay dispersion across the firm. We find a negative association between politically connected boards and <b>top</b> <b>executive</b> pay. We also find that politically connected boards are negatively associated with pay dispersion, i. e., the higher the number of political directors on the board the smaller the gap between <b>top</b> <b>executive</b> pay and average employee pay. Finally, our study shows that politically connected directors weaken the pay-performance link. These findings have important theoretical, policy, and managerial implications...|$|R
