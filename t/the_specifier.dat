25|$|Possessor-raising is a {{syntactic}} {{hypothesis that}} attempts to explain the structures of inalienable DPs. Landau argues that the possessor is initially introduced in <b>the</b> <b>specifier</b> position of DP (Spec-DP), but it later raises to <b>the</b> <b>specifier</b> of VP.

25|$|The DSM-5 {{includes}} a specifier {{for those with}} conduct disorder who also display a callous, unemotional interpersonal style across multiple settings and relationships. <b>The</b> <b>specifier</b> is based on research which suggests that those with conduct disorder who also meet criteria for <b>the</b> <b>specifier</b> {{tend to have a}} more severe form of the disorder with an earlier onset as well as a different response to treatment. Proponents of different types/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this as possibly corresponding to adult primary psychopathy and increased boldness and/or meanness in the triarchic model.|$|E

25|$|Based on the {{interaction}} between lexical properties, locality, and {{the properties of the}} EPP (where a phrasal head selects another phrasal element locally), Hale and Keyser make the claim that <b>the</b> <b>Specifier</b> position or a complement are the only two semantic relations that project a predicate's argument. In 2003, Hale and Keyser put forward this hypothesis and argued that a lexical unit must have one or the other, Specifier or Complement, but cannot have both.|$|E
25|$|In her 2008 book, Verb Meaning and The Lexicon: A First-Phase Syntax, {{linguist}} Gillian Ramchand {{acknowledges the}} roles of lexical entries {{in the selection of}} complex verbs and their arguments. 'First-Phase' syntax proposes that event structure and event participants are directly represented in the syntax by means of binary branching. This branching ensures that <b>the</b> <b>Specifier</b> is the consistently subject, even when investigating the projection of a complex verb's lexical entry and its corresponding syntactic construction. This generalization is also present in Ramchand's theory that the complement of a head for a complex verb phrase must co-describe the verb's event.|$|E
2500|$|Example (9a), the anticausative variant, {{is basic}} {{according}} to the intransitive base approach. The theme ("the stick") is initially merged into <b>the</b> <b>specifier</b> of resP and that it then moves to <b>the</b> <b>specifier</b> of procP. The theme, (“stick”) [...] is therefore given a complex theta-role of both the resultee and the undergoer of the event. In the syntax, the causative form is derived through the addition of an init-head, which introduces the external initiator argument (“Katherine”) in example (9b).|$|E

2500|$|It {{is assumed}} that {{inalienable}} possession constructions are one form of anaphoric binding: obligatory control. Thus, the possessor DP originates in <b>the</b> <b>specifier</b> of the verb; {{the fact that the}} possessor seems to be a semantic argument of the noun arises from the binding relationship between the possessor and possessee DPs.

2500|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} {{challenge}} for antisymmetry is to explain {{the wide variety of}} different surface orders across languages. Any deviation from Spec-Head-Comp order (which implies overall Subject-Verb-Object order, if objects are complements) must be explained by movement. Kayne argues that in some cases, the need for extra movements (previously unnecessary because different underlying orders were assumed for different languages) can actually explain some mysterious typological generalizations. His explanation for the lack of wh-movement in Japanese is the most striking example of this. From the mid-1980s onwards, the standard analysis of wh-movement involved the wh-phrase moving leftward to a position on the left edge of the clause called [...] (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>specifier</b> of the CP phrase). Thus, a derivation of the English question What did John buy? would proceed roughly as follows: ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a new {{analysis}} is {{proposed for the}} multiple subject construction in Japanese. A previous analysis called the Multi-Spec Analysis assumes <b>the</b> multiple <b>specifiers</b> of T and positions the double subjects in them. On this analysis, however, why the double subjects have different meanings from each other cannot be accounted for structurally because both of them occupy <b>the</b> <b>specifiers</b> of <b>the</b> same syntactic category (i. e., T). To overcome this problem, the present study adopts the cartographic approach to syntax and proposes a new analysis: the Mono-Spec Analysis. Instead of <b>the</b> multiple <b>specifiers</b> of T, it assumes FocP above TP and positions {{the first of the}} double subjects in Spec-Foc and the other in Spec-T. I propose that the different meanings of the double subjects are attributable to this configurational difference. As theoretical implications, the relation between structure and meaning is discussed in consideration of multiple subject constructions in other languages such as Korean and Brazilian Portuguese...|$|R
