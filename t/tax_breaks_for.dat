5|$|One of Fletcher's {{priorities}} {{that was}} not resolved during the session was the correction of unintended tax increases on businesses that resulted from the tax reform plan passed in 2005. Fletcher called a special legislative session for mid-June so that the legislature could amend the plan and also authorize tax breaks designed to lure a proposed FutureGen power plant to Henderson. Republican Senate President David L. Williams asked Fletcher to include <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> other businesses as well, but Fletcher insisted on a sparse legislative agenda. The session convened for five days and passed the tax breaks and amended tax reform plan unanimously in both houses. Fletcher applauded the legislature's efficiency.|$|E
5|$|P Associates {{received}} {{final approval}} from the city zoning board and the historical commission in August 1999, but continued to seek more financing, which {{it was able to}} secure from Corus Bank of Chicago in September 2001. To develop the tower, now called The St. James, P Associates formed the St. James Associates Joint Venture with Clark Realty Capital LLC and Lend Lease Real Estate Investments, which represented an undisclosed client. With financial backing from its partners and <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> new residential construction passed in 2000, construction began on November 28, 2001. BACE Construction (Philadelphia based) was awarded the construction of the project. Philadelphia had not seen any residential high-rise development since the 1980s, and The St. James {{was one of the first}} to begin construction in the city, preceded only by the 16-story Residences at the Dockside, which broke ground in 2000. It became the largest residential building in the city.|$|E
5|$|Zahorchak was {{appointed}} state Secretary of Education on October 5, 2005, by Governor Ed Rendell, following {{the resignation of}} former Secretary Francis Barnes. He was considered highly regarded by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers involved in education issues. During his Pennsylvania State Senate confirmation hearing in December 2005, Zahorchak said he supported the state's $44million Educational Improvement Tax Credit, which provides <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> businesses that support public education programs and private school scholarships. Zahorchak also said he believed basic education should be the state's primary fiscal educational investment, rather than special education or higher education. The Pennsylvania State Senate Education Committee unanimously approved Zahorchak during his confirmation hearing on December 13, 2005, and the full senate unanimously confirmed him on February 7, 2006.|$|E

5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed {{by the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{voted on}} {{multiple}} occasions in 2007—2012 to block measures {{that would have}} eliminated or reduced <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> oil and gas producers. For example, in January 2007, he voted against the Energy Independence and Security Act, which supporters said would have rescinded $14 billion in <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> oil and gas drillers. In February 2008, he voted against the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act, which supporters said would have eliminated $18 billion in tax benefits for oil companies and substituted tax credits for wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources. In May 2008, he voted against the Energy Improvement and Extension Act, which supporters said contained provisions to cut <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> oil companies and to expand <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> alternative energies like solar and geothermal power, biodiesel fuels, and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In July 2010, he voted against the Consolidated Land, Energy, and Aquatic Resources Act of 2009, which would have removed federal caps on oil companies' liability for oil spills, and would have cut certain <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> oil companies. In February 2011, he voted against a measure to reinstate royalties assessed for oil drilled when oil prices are high. In March, April, and May 2011, he voted against measures {{that would have allowed}} consideration of legislation to eliminate <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> oil companies and promote production and use of alternative energy sources.|$|E

25|$|Up until 2007, {{construction}} {{was a major}} local employer, mainly due to government <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> property development provided under the Rural Renewal scheme.

25|$|Further {{enhancements}} to HSAs {{went into}} effect in 2007. The combination of <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> premiums and the health savings account as well as a tax subsidy to pay for the catastrophic insurance premium of lower income individuals has boosted the popularity of these plans. By April 2007, some 4.5 million Americans were enrolled in HSAs; more than a fourth of those were previously uninsured.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the federal}} Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) {{controls}} most employee benefits provided by private employers, DOMA removed some <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> {{employers and employees}} {{in the private sector}} when it comes to health care, pension, and disability benefits to same-sex spouses on an equal footing with opposite-sex spouses.

The presence of the plant near an Indian reservation provided considerable <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> Rubashkin. Governor Dave Heineman presented a $505,000 gratuity check to Rubashkin on behalf of the city of Gordon, as part of an incentive package that brought the factory to the town.|$|E
25|$|Angelides {{also called}} for {{reducing}} <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> corporations and individuals earning $500,000 or more per year, in a plan to earn revenue to increase funding for public K-12 education and higher education. The plan would halt and repeal increases made in the tuition fees of the University of California system, and the California Community College system. He stated his opposition to sending National Guard troops to the California-Mexico border and wanted to seek closer ties with the then-President of Mexico, Vicente Fox. This plan was criticized by his opponents as a tax hike.|$|E
25|$|Talent {{did take}} a {{position}} on the ballot-initiative in Missouri, called Proposition B, that would raise the minimum wage in the state to $6.50 per hour, or {{to the level of the}} federal minimum wage if that is higher, with subsequent adjustments for inflation. He said he believed it was a state issue, but stated he supports minimum wage increases if they are coupled with <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> small businesses. Talent believed that increasing the minimum wage could reduce the number of jobs by raising the cost of doing business.|$|E

25|$|Eves {{took office}} on April 15, 2002, and {{promptly}} re-aligned his {{government to the}} political centre. The party would negotiate a deal with striking government workers, dramatically cancel an IPO of Hydro One, the government's electricity transmission company, and defer planned <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> corporations and private schools for a year. With polls showing the Conservatives moving from a 15-point deficit to a tie in public opinion with the Liberals, the media praising Eves' political reorientation of the government, and the opposition Liberals reeling from the seizure {{of some of their}} political turf, the time seemed ripe for a snap election call. Many political observers felt that Eves had the momentum to win an election at that time.|$|E
25|$|In March, {{three models}} with the world's first {{electric}} power steering (CGPF/CGPL/CGPJ) {{were added to the}} lineup, at a juicy ¥150,000 surcharge. Actress and pop idol Yuka Ōnishi (大西結花) was the spokesperson for the ad campaign, while an all female motorcycle racing team (Team Angela) raced a Turbocharged Cervo in the Safari Rally. However, it was all to no avail: The rivals, Daihatsu's new Leeza and Mazda's Autozam Carol both sold much better. Combined with the removal of certain <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> small cargo vehicles, this meant that the Cervo's already narrow slot in the market had essentially disappeared. When the new 660cc Kei regulations were introduced, Suzuki decided to call it quits rather than {{spend a lot of money}} to update such a slow-selling vehicle and Cervo production ended in May 1990.|$|E
25|$|Entrepreneur Michael Smurfit who {{was searching}} for a {{suitable}} old house and estate to develop as a country club recruited Ray Carroll, former manager at the Grosvenor Hotel in London {{to help with the}} task. Carroll recommended Straffan above seven other estates he had examined. In 1988 Straffan House was sold for £7m to the Jefferson Smurfit company for use as a golf course and hotel. A further £35m was spent developing the house as a hotel under a scheme negotiated with the government to produce 200 jobs in return for <b>tax</b> <b>breaks</b> <b>for</b> investors. In 1991 Straffan House was opened as a 31-bedroom hotel. In 2004 a wing was added to double the size of the hotel and a granite porch from Ballynegal, Co.Westmeath used to bring the two wings together.|$|E
5000|$|The {{choice to}} name the ship after a Nazi SS member {{provoked}} an outcry from some politicians and Jewish groups around the world.

25|$|Before {{winning the}} 2001 general {{election}} and becoming Prime Minister of Italy, Berlusconi signed in a TV show a Contract with Italians, where he promised, if elected, to fulfil {{at least four}} of the five points included in it.

40|$|Abstract only availableIn {{an attempt}} to boost {{business}} investment, the 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act gave business owners an income tax deduction of up to $ 100, 000 {{of the purchase price}} of any vehicle greater than 6, 000 pounds used for business purposes. This is a 200 % increase from the previous maximum deduction allowed. This paper estimates the effects of this <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> on the demand for heavy vehicles and attempts to address the efficiency of the policy in terms of both increased business investment and costs imposed by heavier vehicles. The extent to which the policy is successful in increasing business investment depends heavily on whether or not the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> generated new purchases of heavy vehicles. Policy effectiveness is undermined when business owners already planning to buy a vehicle substitute heavier vehicles covered under the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> <b>for</b> lighter vehicles not covered under the <b>tax</b> <b>break.</b> Moderate evidence is found of an increase in demand for heavier vehicles. Weak evidence for substitution effects of heavier vehicles covered under the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> <b>for</b> lighter vehicles not covered by the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> is found. The overall evidence suggests a slight increase in the demand for larger vehicles, implying minimal both environmental costs and business investment. This counters most arguments of both the automakers who supported the <b>tax</b> <b>break</b> and environmental activists who criticized it. MU Undergraduate Research Scholars Progra...|$|R
