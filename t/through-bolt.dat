50|$|Type I hybrid masonry has {{no direct}} contact with the {{surround}} steel frame. For this reason, there are not two subsets of this configuration. Lateral forces are transmitted to the masonry panel through steel plates that are connected to the floor beams and attached to the wall with a <b>through-bolt.</b> The hole in the plate for the <b>through-bolt</b> is slotted so that gravity loads are not transmitted to the masonry panel; the vertical loads travel solely through the steel frame. Thus, the masonry panel takes only the story shear from the above floors and acts as a one story shear wall.|$|E
50|$|A long-bolt or <b>through-bolt</b> {{engine is}} an {{internal}} combustion piston engine where, following usual practice, the cylinder head is held down by bolts or studs. Conventionally the cylinder head is {{bolted to the}} cylinder block and the crankshaft main bearings are in turn bolted to the crankcase by separate bolts. In the long-bolt engine however, a single set of long bolts is used, spanning from the cylinder head right through to the crankshaft bearing caps.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} specifications {{necessary for}} designing hybrid masonry systems that resist <b>through-bolt</b> push out effects. Hybrid masonry {{is a relatively}} new structural system {{that can be used in}} seismic areas and comprises masonry panels connected to frames through steel plate connectors. However, masonry break-out at the connection between the steel plates and the masonry panel requires further analysis to better understand the load transfer mechanism of the hybrid masonry system. Therefore, we use a computational framework to model the hybrid masonry that uses a typical plasticity model with hardening for the steel components and a nonlocal two-scalar damage model that accounts for tension and compression for the masonry panel. Based on parametric studies conducted using this framework we provide recommendations for the <b>through-bolt</b> location and for the reinforcement percentage and location within the masonry panel to achieve best results in the load transfer mechanism of the hybrid masonry system during a seismic event...|$|E

FRC poles can be pre-drilled by the manufacturer, or holes can be drilled on site.

Metal roofing is commonly used as the roofing and siding material on pole buildings.|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{collapse}} of MG Rover in 2005, the Chinese automaker Nanjing Automobile acquired the Longbridge plant and the intellectual property rights to many designs, {{including those of the}} K series engine. The Chinese owner, now SAIC Motor, went on to further develop the K series engine, renaming it [...] "N series" [...] and using it to power its current range of MG cars, the MG 6. The revisions included a different design of cylinder head gasket, higher tensile strength <b>through-bolts</b> and a stronger oil-rail fitted in the bottom end of the engine that the through bolts screw into. These revisions are sold by the British company XPart to solve the issues that some K series engines had of cylinder head gasket failure.|$|R

A single 2 1 / 4 in. dia. bolt is used, and previous calculations have determined that the design load on this joint should be 130, 000 lbs tension.

50|$|The {{power unit}} was an all-new four-cylinder design with a {{belt-driven}} overhead camshaft. The crankcase and cylinder head {{were made from}} aluminium alloy while the block was of cast iron, with all three sections being held together by long <b>through-bolts.</b> This was identical construction to the original Austin Seven's engine and similar ideas would be revisted in the 1980s for the Rover K-Series engine. Capacity in the prototype was 1000cc with versions as low as 750cc possible, as well as six-cylinder versions which would still be compact enough to install transversely. Power output was 60 horsepower per litre (as opposed to around 40 hp/litre for the existing A-Series engine) and the new engine was also significantly lighter. To reduce maintenance {{and the number of}} parts the engine's alternator was incorporated into the flywheel (a common practice on motorcycles).|$|R
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. Hybrid masonry {{construction}} has relatively recently been {{developed as a}} means to provide a more efficient use of masonry infill walls by designing these walls to function {{as a part of a}} structure's lateral force resisting system, with current applications in low seismic regions (Seismic Design Categories A, B, and C). In regions of higher seismicity (Seismic Design Categories D and greater), there exists a much greater need for a clearer understanding of the mechanics of the interaction between the steel frame of a building and the masonry shear wall as well as the development of specific detailing requirements to provide for a ductile and somewhat predictable response in a seismic event of significant magnitude. The scope of this thesis is the investigation of the connection between the steel beam and the top of the masonry wall for a Type I hybrid masonry system, using a proposed steel connector plate <b>through-bolted</b> to the masonry wall bond beam, in order to provide preliminary guidelines and recommendations for the development of energy dissipating hybrid masonry connector plates. The first portion of this study focused on the development of connector plate designs to determine which provided the most stable, ductile cyclic response. The second portion of this study investigated the strength and limit states of the <b>through-bolted</b> connection to the masonry wall bond beam under shear loading. Based on these experiments, recommendations are provided for the most suitable connector plate designs as well as a general evaluation of the connection to the masonry wall and potential limit states to consider in future design applications. For a "rigid" connection between the steel frame and CMU wall, link connectors with a thickness greater than 0. 5 inches is recommended, whereas fuse Type T was proven to be superior for a ductile, energy dissipating connector plate. ACI 530 - 08 design values for bolt shear yielding and masonry shear failure were determined to be the most appropriate limit states for determining an approximate design values for the thru-bolted CMU wall connections...|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Rover {{were aware that}} they needed to adopt {{innovative}} and reliable new techniques if they were to survive as a car maker and, like Fiat, to throw off their previous problems of poor build quality. One result was the K engine, to be built by Rover's partner Powertrain Ltd. This used a ladder main bearing in all models, giving an extremely rigid block that would later permit a very high redline speed in applications such as the MGF, Lotus Elise and for racing. Unlike the FIRE though, and despite the large numbers sold that served reliably for many years, this engine was tarred with Rover's past flaws and gained a reputation as unreliable. The flaws that gave rise to this reputation were caused by only some components used in only some models: particularly the head gasket and wet liners. Regarding these problems with particular component versions as indicative of poor overall engine design was undeserved. Equally, none of these problems are inherent with the techniques of wet liners or <b>through-bolting.</b>|$|R
50|$|One of Karl's {{strengths}} is {{his ability}} to create new activities and the enjoyment he gets from doing so. An environment of creativity, of pushing for the new modification or of putting together two previously separate things, has been important to renewing our base. Karl also works easily with others and likes to give them liberal credit, always important in developing new ideas and activities. PA now has a fifty-element repertoire of Ropes Course elements, including the following notable PA inventions: Wild Woosey, Mohawk Walk, Prouty's Landing, Pamper Pole, Hickory jump, Seagull Landing, and the Flying Squirrel. The first indoor elements were built in the Newburyport, Mass. gym in 1972, and by 1985 every outdoor element had been constructed in some sort of indoor environment. The refinement of the technology and equipment for the Ropes Course includes these innovations: galvanized cable, <b>through-bolting,</b> strand vises, telephone poles and accompanying guy technology, custom made pulley systems for the belay cable and for the Zip Wire. The invention of new activities was even more pronounced in the Initiative and game area, and the publication of Silver Bullets: A Guide to Initiative Problems and Adventure Games was a notable benchmark for the organization. The possibilities continue to expand, as PA has become a gathering point for others' ideas in this area.|$|R
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. In steel construction, {{there are}} various seismic {{structural}} systems that have been successfully utilized in the past including eccentric and concentric braced frames and moment frame systems. When these systems are used, the building envelope between structural members is filled with architectural components such as masonry infill walls, which are only expected to carry out of plane loads, such as wind, on each individual wall panel. Hybrid masonry {{is a relatively new}} type of structural system which incorporates the masonry infill walls within steel frames into the structural system to resist lateral loads imposed on the structure. This research represents the third phase of testing at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) and is part of an ongoing project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Research (NEESR) to investigate the applicability of hybrid masonry as an adequate structural system. In phases I and II of hybrid masonry connector plate development research at UHM, a wide variety of connector designs were explored to determine the positive and negative aspects to different fuse and link connector plate designs and connection methods. Fuse connector tests demonstrated the viability of tapered fuses to dissipate large amounts of energy during cyclic loading. These tests also showed that various practical connector orientations and methods can be applied for hybrid masonry connectors, particularly the straight bolted side plate connection. In addition, during phase I of testing, a series of bolt push out tests were performed to determine the shear strength of post-installed <b>through-bolts</b> in masonry. Observations from the first two phases of testing were used as a guide for selecting 4 -inch and 6 -inch tapered fuse designs for testing on partially grouted and fully grouted masonry wall specimens. Multiple pairs of both tapered fuse connectors were slip-critically bolted to side plates, which were welded to a steel beam above the masonry wall specimens. These tests were performed to verify that the behavior of multiple pairs of connector plates in series is similar to the behavior of the individual pairs of connector plates. In addition, the tests were performed to observe the interaction between the steel connector plates and masonry wall specimens. Based on numerous observations and results in this phase of testing, the design of Type I hybrid masonry connections was improved. The fuse connector tests showed that the strength and behavior of multiple pairs of fuse connectors can be approximated by designing a single connector plate and multiplying the single plate's capacity by the number of connector plates used. These fuse connectors displayed the capability of dissipating large amounts of seismic energy before failure. Based on the results of these connector subassembly tests, recommended design procedures for connector plates were modified. Both masonry walls failed by means of shear friction at the location of the joint between the masonry and concrete slab. The results from UHM's testing will guide the development of full-scale two-story hybrid masonry test frames which will be tested at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign...|$|R
