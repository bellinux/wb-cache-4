A multimodal approach is often used, with several AAC approaches introduced so that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> take advantage of the most effective method for a particular situation.|$|E

25|$|It {{is because}} this process takes this dialectical form, {{in which each}} new stage is created through the further differentiation, integration, and {{synthesis}} of new structures out of the old, that the sequence of cognitive stages are logically necessary rather than simply empirically correct.

25|$|Furthermore, various {{evidence}} {{suggest that}} certain household differences affecting how {{a child is}} raised can influence how similar (or different) a child is to the opposite sex, therefore how “feminine” or “masculine” <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> potentially become. For instance, as certain research demonstrates, {{in the absence of}} a father figure boys are generally more “feminine” than those living with a father. This demonstrates the significance of father-son modeling. The same research reveals that boyhood femininity is more strongly correlated with parental reinforcement such as a father or mother’s desire for a girl and/or their approval for feminine behaviours.|$|E

25|$|Stereotypies are repetitive, rhythmic, simple {{movements}} {{that can be}} voluntarily suppressed. Like tremors, they are typically back and forth movements, and most commonly occur bilaterally. They often involve fingers, wrists, or proximal portions of the upper extremities. Although, like tics, they can stem from stress and excitement, there is no underlying urge to move associated with stereotypies and these movements can be stopped with distraction. When aware of the movements, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> also suppress them voluntarily. Stereotypies are often associated with developmental syndromes, including the autism spectrum disorders. Stereotypies are quite common in preschool-aged children {{and for this reason}} are not necessarily indicative of neurological pathology on their own.|$|E
25|$|Ophthalmopatic {{findings}} {{are more common}} but less severe in children (severe infiltrative exophthalmos is virtually unknown before mid-adolescence), but besides that, many of the typical clinical features of hyperthyroidism {{in children and adolescents}} are similar to those in adults. An important difference between children and adults with Graves' disease, is that children have not yet developed like adults have (psychological and physiological), and that they are a lot more dependent on their environment. The encephalopathy will have profound effects on children's developing personalities and developing relationship with their environment. Disturbments in bodily development further complicates matters. The consequences for the development and the somatic and psychological wellbeing of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> be very radical and sometimes irreversible. The earlier a person is affected by thyroid disease, the more the development of personality is affected and the bigger the delay from their potential development level. The child gets behind in its cognitive, emotional and sexual growth, which, by itself, also influences its processing abilities of the endocrine disease.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{androgynous}} people are able to enhance performance cross-situationally because they can alter their behaviors appropriately to becoming more “masculine” or “feminine” in the given context. According to a study, a person’s activity preference in games and interests are purely based on their gender-typed stereotypes, making the person significantly more stereotyped than androgynous people. In a self-esteem test, when individuals were given opposite-sex activities, gender-typed individuals generally felt more uncomfortable, leading to decreased levels of self-esteem. However, androgynous subjects did not feel discomfort or pessimism about themselves. Therefore, gender typing can often lead to specific gender-rule stereotypes to better facilitate decision making which can adhere to certain benefits as well as limitations. Therefore, parents who foster more non-traditional views in sex role orientation tend to encourage a less discriminatory environment. <b>The</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> then freely engage in more choices that are not affected by gender limitations. Androgynous children have been found to have higher self-esteem and higher self-worth.|$|E

2500|$|Attachment theory (Bowlby 1969, 1973, 1980) {{is rooted}} in the ethological notion that a newborn child is biologically {{programmed}} to seek proximity with caregivers, and this proximity-seeking behavior is naturally selected.

2500|$|The {{pre-operational}} {{stage is}} sparse and logically inadequate {{in regard to}} mental operations. The child is able to form stable concepts as well as magical beliefs. The child, however, is still not able to perform operations, which are tasks that <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>can</b> do mentally, rather than physically. Thinking in this stage is still egocentric, meaning the child has difficulty seeing the viewpoint of others. The Pre-operational Stage is split into two substages: the symbolic function substage, and the intuitive thought substage. The symbolic function substage is when children are able to understand, represent, remember, and picture objects in their mind without having the object in front of them. The intuitive thought substage is when children tend to propose the questions of [...] "why?" [...] and [...] "how come?"
