5|$|In statistics, maximum spacing {{estimation}} (MSE or MSP), or maximum {{product of}} spacing estimation (MPS), {{is a method}} for estimating <b>the</b> <b>parameters</b> of a univariate statistical model.

5|$|Limitations include that a {{consistent}} set of gases {{must be used}} which match the specific ratio model, and the specific ratio will only be relevant to a limited range of depths. As <b>the</b> <b>parameters</b> {{move away from the}} base conditions, conservatism will diverge, and the probability of symptomatic bubble formation will become more unpredictable. There is also the requirement for the diver to do mental arithmetic at depth to calculate <b>the</b> <b>parameters</b> of a safety-critical operation.
