500|$|Higginbotham entered Purdue as a {{freshman}} in 1944. At the time, the student body was composed of approximately 6,000 white students, and 12 black students. Although eligible for admission, black students were not permitted {{to live in the}} dormitories. Higginbotham and the other 11 black students were placed in a building called International House, which was the only building that blacks could live in West Lafayette. The students slept in the attic, which was unheated. Higginbotham sought a meeting with the University President, Edward C. Elliott, to ask permission for the students to sleep in a section of one of the heated dormitories. Elliott's response was purportedly [...] "he law doesn't require us to put you in those dormitories. The law doesn't even require us to let you in. You <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> it." [...] Higginbotham would later identify this encounter, and an incident where he was traveling with the Purdue debate team, but unable to stay in a hotel {{with the rest of the}} members, as the events that caused him to pursue a career in the law, saying: ...|$|E

2500|$|BBC News {{stated that}} the 2007 re-adoption {{prompted}} a more supportive response from the government than the initial 2002 initiative, which ended up being [...] "rejected... outright after it was first proposed". Israel attempted to mount a counter-proposal in May 2007 to work out those contentious issues. In May 2007, an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman said that [...] "Israel {{has no interest in}} stagnation and unfortunately, if the Arab initiative is <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> it, that will be a recipe for stagnation". Progress stalled until Israel began a serious reconsideration of the offer in October 2008. As of January 2009, both sides have been unable to come to any agreement and the initiative seems dormant.|$|E
60|$|Yes, Art is {{the great}} and {{universal}} refreshment. For Art is never dogmatic; holds no brief for itself you may <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> you may <b>leave</b> <b>it.</b> It does not force itself rudely where it is not wanted. It is reverent to all tempers, to all points of view. But it is wilful--the very wind in {{the comings and goings}} of its influence, an uncapturable fugitive, visiting our hearts at vagrant, sweet moments; since we often stand even before the greatest works of Art without being able quite to lose ourselves! That restful oblivion comes, we never quite know when--and it is gone! But when it comes, it is a spirit hovering with cool wings, blessing us from least to greatest, according to our powers; a spirit deathless and varied as human life itself.|$|R
6000|$|A whole hour drifted by, {{the master}} sat nodding in his throne, {{the air was}} drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins {{straightened}} himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book, but seemed undecided whether to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> out <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it.</b> Most of the pupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while, then <b>took</b> <b>it</b> out and settled himself in his chair to read! Tom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot his quarrel with her. Quick--something must be done! done in a flash, too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention. Good!--he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring {{through the door and}} fly. But his resolution shook for one little instant, and the chance was lost--the master opened the volume. If Tom only had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help for Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school. Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even the innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten --the master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: [...] "Who tore this book?" ...|$|R

I agreed with her that I would drop the subject for a while, and that {{meanwhile}} we should be good friends. We should take time {{to know each other}} better and act in accordance with further knowledge. There was no hurry, since we trusted each other--wrong as my trust might be. She had no wish that I should go away. I was not in the least disagreeable to her; she liked me extremely, and I was perfectly free to try and please her. Only I should drop my proposal, and be free to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> up again <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> alone, later, as I should choose. If she felt differently then, I should have the benefit of it, and if I myself felt differently, I should also have the benefit of it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Columnist Elsa Maxwell, {{commenting on}} Block's {{approach}} to writing, {{said he was}} [...] "serious – almost academic – about being funny." [...] Block was once asked what was the hardest material to write for a comedian. He quipped, [...] "The ad libs!" [...] While it was widely believed that emcee Phil Baker ad-libbed the popular game shows <b>Take</b> <b>It</b> <b>Or</b> <b>Leave</b> It and $64 Question, most of the shows were actually written by Block. An example of what [...] appears to be casual conversation, but was actually a joke written by Block, was for entertainer Kenny Murray to say to his television studio audience: [...] "I don't care whether you laugh at my jokes or not. But it will be pretty embarrassing for you if {{people all over the}} country find out you don't have a sense of humor." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{positive}} review for Time, Richard Corliss called The Passion of the Christ [...] "a serious, handsome, excruciating film that radiates total commitment." [...] New York Press film critic Armond White praised Gibson's direction, comparing him to Carl Theodor Dreyer in how he transformed art into spirituality. Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun-Times gave the movie {{four out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "the most violent film [...] ha ever seen" [...] as well as reflecting on how the film personally impacted him as a former altar boy saying [...] "What Gibson has provided for me, {{for the first time}} in my life, is a visceral idea of what the Passion consisted of. That his film is superficial in terms of the surrounding message -- that we get only a few passing references to the teachings of Jesus -- is, I suppose, not the point. This is not a sermon or a homily, but a visualization of the central event in the Christian religion. <b>Take</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> it." [...] In a negative review, Slate magazine's David Edelstein called it [...] "a two-hour-and-six-minute snuff movie", while Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News felt it was [...] "the most virulently anti-Semitic movie made since the German propaganda films of World War II". Writing for the Dallas Observer, Robert Wilonsky said he found the movie [...] "too turgid to awe the nonbelievers, too zealous to inspire and often too silly to take seriously, with its demonic hallucinations that look like escapees from a David Lynch film; I swear I couldn't find the devil carrying around a hairy-backed midget anywhere in the text I read." ...|$|E
6000|$|Frederick Bullock, Esq., of {{the house}} of Bullock, Hulker, and Bullock, had married Maria Osborne, not without a great deal of {{difficulty}} and grumbling on Mr. Bullock's part. George being dead and cut out of his father's will, Frederick insisted that the half of the old gentleman's property should be settled upon his Maria, and indeed, for a long time, refused, [...] "to come to the scratch" [...] (it was Mr. Frederick's own expression) on any other terms. Osborne said Fred had agreed to take his daughter with twenty thousand, and he should bind himself to no more. [...] "Fred might <b>take</b> <b>it,</b> and welcome, <b>or</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it,</b> and go and be hanged." [...] Fred, whose hopes had been raised when George had been disinherited, thought himself infamously swindled by the old merchant, and for some time made as if he would break off the match altogether. Osborne withdrew his account from Bullock and Hulker's, went on 'Change with a horsewhip which he swore he would lay across the back of a certain scoundrel that should be nameless, and demeaned himself in his usual violent manner. Jane Osborne condoled with her sister Maria during this family feud. [...] "I always told you, Maria, that it was your money he loved and not you," [...] she said, soothingly.|$|R
