25|$|Repeatability in an {{industrial}} process is also subject {{to the accuracy of}} <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>effector,</b> for example a gripper, and even to the design of the 'fingers' that match the gripper to the object being grasped. For example, if a robot picks a screw by its head, the screw could be at a random angle. A subsequent attempt to insert the screw into a hole could easily fail. These and similar scenarios can be improved with 'lead-ins' e.g. by making the entrance to the hole tapered.|$|E
25|$|The American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems — Safety Requirements (ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999) {{defines a}} {{singularity}} as “a condition {{caused by the}} collinear alignment {{of two or more}} robot axes resulting in unpredictable robot motion and velocities.” It is most common in robot arms that utilize a “triple-roll wrist”. This is a wrist about which the three axes of the wrist, controlling yaw, pitch, and roll, all pass through a common point. An example of a wrist singularity is when the path through which the robot is traveling causes the first and third axes of the robot’s wrist (i.e. robot's axes 4 and 6) to line up. The second wrist axis then attempts to spin 180° in zero time to maintain the orientation of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>effector.</b> Another common term for this singularity is a “wrist flip”. The result of a singularity can be quite dramatic and can have adverse effects on the robot arm, <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>effector,</b> and the process. Some industrial robot manufacturers have attempted to side-step the situation by slightly altering the robot’s path to prevent this condition. Another method is to slow the robot’s travel speed, thus reducing the speed required for the wrist to make the transition. The ANSI/RIA has mandated that robot manufacturers shall make the user aware of singularities if they occur while the system is being manually manipulated.|$|E

25|$|Inverse kinematics: {{a problem}} similar to Inverse {{dynamics}} but with different goals and starting assumptions.

25|$|The final spacewalk of the STS-134 mission, and {{the final}} spacewalk of the Space Shuttle program, was carried out on flight day 12. The EVA was {{conducted}} by Mike Fincke and Greg Chamitoff, who began the EVA by installing the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) on the Starboard 1 (S1) truss segment. After the OBSS was installed, Fincke and Chamitoff removed <b>the</b> <b>End</b> <b>Effector</b> Grapple Fixture (EFGF) {{and replaced it with}} a spare Power and Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF). The station's Canadarm2 could not grapple the EFGF, so the PDGF was installed on the end. After that task was completed, Fincke and Chamitoff moved to the Express Logistics Carrier (ELC) 3, and released some torque on the bolts that were holding the spare arm for Dextre down against the ELC. The EVA saw the total cumulative time spent performing EVAs in support of the ISS pass the 1,000-hour mark. The three STS-134 spacewalkers spent a total time of 28 hours and 44 minutes outside the ISS on this mission. Commander Mark Kelly assisted with documenting the spacewalk by taking photos and video. In the meantime, the rest of the shuttle crew completed more equipment transfers from Endeavour and the Johannes Kepler ATV to the ISS.|$|E
2500|$|For a given robot {{the only}} {{parameters}} necessary to completely locate <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> (gripper, welding torch, etc.) of the robot are the angles {{of each of}} the joints or displacements of the linear axes (or combinations of the two for robot formats such as SCARA). However, there are many different ways to define the points. The most common and most convenient way of defining a point is to specify a Cartesian coordinate for it, i.e. the position of the 'end effector' in mm in the X, Y and Z directions relative to the robot's origin. In addition, depending on the types of joints a particular robot may have, the orientation of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> in yaw, pitch, and roll and the location of the tool point relative to the robot's faceplate must also be specified. For a jointed arm these coordinates must be converted to joint angles by the robot controller and such conversions are known as Cartesian Transformations which may need to be performed iteratively or recursively for a multiple axis robot. The mathematics of the relationship between joint angles and actual spatial coordinates is called kinematics. See robot control ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a new control approach to multi-contact balancing for torque-controlled humanoid robots. The controller includes a non-strict task hierarchy, {{which allows the}} robot to use a subset of its <b>end</b> <b>effectors</b> for balancing while the remaining ones {{can be used for}} interacting with the environment. The controller creates a passive and compliant behavior for regulating the center of mass (CoM) location, hip orientation and the poses of each <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> assigned to <b>the</b> interaction task. This is achieved by applying a suitable wrench (force and torque) at each one of <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>effectors</b> used for interaction. The contact wrenches at <b>the</b> balancing <b>end</b> <b>effectors</b> are chosen such that the sum of the balancing and interaction wrenches produce the desired wrench at the CoM. The algorithm requires the solution of an optimization problem, which distributes the CoM wrench to <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>effectors</b> taking into account constraints for unilaterality, friction and position of the center of pressure. Furthermore, the Feedback controller is combined with a feedforward control in order to improve performance while tracking a predefined trajectory, leading to a control structure similar to a PD+ control.

40|$|Nanomanipulation {{using the}} atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) has been extensively investigated for many years. But the efficiency and accuracy of AFM-based nanomanipulation are still major issues due to the nonlinearities and uncertainties in nanomanipulation operations. The deformation of the cantilever caused by manipulation force {{is one of the}} most major nonlinearities and uncertainties. It causes difficulties in accurately controlling the tip position, and results in missing the position of the object. The softness of the conventional cantilevers also causes the failure of manipulation of sticky nano-objects because the tip can easily slip over the nano-objects. In this paper, an active atomic force microscopy probe is used as an adaptable <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> to solve these problems by actively controlling the cantilever's flexibility or rigidity during nanomanipulation. A control voltage is applied to the piezo layer of <b>the</b> adaptable <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> to exert a reverse bending moment on the cantilever to balance the bending moment caused by the interaction force during manipulation. Thus, <b>the</b> adaptable <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> is controlled to maintain straight shape during manipulation. A detailed model of <b>the</b> adaptable <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> is presented in the paper. Control of <b>the</b> adaptable <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> employing an optimal LQR control law is derived and implemented. The experimental results verify the validity of the model and effectiveness of the controller.
