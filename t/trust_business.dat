40|$|The modern, {{statutory}} <b>business</b> <b>trust</b> is {{an increasingly}} important business vehicle in both the United States and around the world; it remains, however, woefully understudied. In particular, hardly any comparative legal research on <b>business</b> <b>trusts</b> exists. This Article seeks to fill such a void by providing a comparative analysis of <b>business</b> <b>trusts</b> and <b>business</b> <b>trust</b> listings in Singapore and Hong Kong, two of the world’s most important financial centers and the only two major jurisdictions in the world which have actively opened up their capital markets for <b>business</b> <b>trust</b> listings; this Article is, to my knowledge, the first scholarly investigation of <b>business</b> <b>trusts</b> in Singapore and Hong Kong. The Article argues that the experience in Hong Kong and Singapore and hype there over <b>business</b> <b>trusts</b> shows that <b>business</b> <b>trusts</b> are gaining some popularity in foreign jurisdictions as important capital-raising vehicles, apart from traditional <b>business</b> <b>trust</b> forms in jurisdictions such as the United States (such as mutual funds and pension funds). As seen through the Singaporean and Hong Kong experiences, when listed on public stock exchanges, <b>business</b> <b>trusts</b> arguably offer numerous advantages, namely: greater distributions to the beneficiaries, since distributions can be made out of cash flows rather than accounting profits); more funding opportunities (through listing); increased investor liquidity; and the asset owner’s ability continue to exercise control over the trust’s assets, to name a few. The control advantage is especially important, as Singapore and Hong Kong currently do not permit dual class stock structures – thus, <b>business</b> <b>trusts</b> offer management a suitable alternative to raise capital while maintaining control, and Singapore (and Hong Kong, which, as of June 2012, is still finalizing its <b>business</b> <b>trust</b> listing regulatory regime) can serve as potential models for empowering <b>business</b> <b>trusts</b> as an alternate corporate form. The Article ends with a brief analytical comparison of <b>business</b> <b>trusts</b> and dual class stock structures and argues that the Singaporean and Hong Kong models can serve as points of reference for US <b>business</b> <b>trust</b> law reform...|$|R

40|$|Most times <b>businesses</b> {{prefer to}} <b>trust</b> their <b>business</b> {{partners}} and customers in achieving success than keeping {{to the rules}} and regulations guiding the business activities. Experience has also shown that many businesses claimed to rely on <b>trust</b> to achieve <b>business</b> success, however, business policy seems to play more significant and effective role in achieving business success and keeping the business going. Therefore, the issue of whether <b>trust</b> determines <b>business</b> success better than business policy called for an urgent attention as many <b>businesses</b> relied on <b>trust</b> rather than <b>business</b> policy. In view of this, the paper examines which among one of these factors better determine business success. It examined <b>trust</b> and <b>business</b> policy based on credit and loans perspective. Based on the literature and previous business experience, it was argued that businesses could make better success and prevent the business from death by sticking on their business policy rather than mere <b>business</b> <b>trust</b> which could be injured...|$|R

40|$|When {{bankruptcy}} courts {{attempt to}} define the <b>business</b> <b>trust,</b> the “decisions are sharply, and perhaps hopelessly, divided. ” The Bankruptcy Code, which guides the determinations of bankruptcy courts, specifically lists <b>business</b> <b>trusts</b> as eligible for protection. However, the Code does not define what a <b>business</b> <b>trust</b> is and does not list any criteria for determining when a <b>trust</b> is a <b>business</b> <b>trust.</b> The lack of a concrete definition has led many courts to formulate their own definitions of <b>business</b> <b>trusts.</b> While the courts hoped that they would eventually settle on a uniform test to tackle this issue, {{it has yet to}} occur. Presently, courts apply varying tests, some of which propose twenty-four individual factors to consider while others adopt tax and state laws. This confusion regarding the appropriate test leads to uncertainty on behalf of debtors, who are unsure if they will be eligible for bankruptcy protection. This Comment proposes a restatement test that incorporates the history of the <b>business</b> <b>trust</b> as well as courts’ various previous approaches into a single uniform test. Part II of this Comment will address the history of the <b>business</b> <b>trust</b> from its roots in feudal England to its use as a tool to circumvent strict corporate statutes. Part II will outline {{the current state of the}} law regarding <b>business</b> <b>trusts,</b> both within and outside the bankruptcy context. Part IV proposes a four-factor test to remedy the courts’ current confusion regarding <b>business</b> <b>trusts...</b>|$|R
