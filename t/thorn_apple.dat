60|$|The creolla is {{no doubt}} the {{descendant}} of the fowl originally introduced about three centuries ago by the first colonists in La Plata, and has probably not only been uncrossed with any other improved variety, such as are now fast taking its place, and has lived a much freer life than is usual with the fowl in Europe. It is a rather small, lean, extremely active bird, lays about a dozen eggs, and hatches them all, and is of a yellowish red colour--a hue which is common, I believe, in the old barn-door fowl of England. The creolla fowl is strong on the wing, and much more carnivorous and rapacious in habits than other breeds; mice, frogs, and small snakes are eagerly hunted and devoured by it. At my home on the pampas {{a number of these}} fowls were kept, and were allowed to range freely about the plantation, which was large, and the adjacent grounds, where there were thickets of giant cardoon thistle, red-weed, <b>thorn</b> <b>apple,</b> &c. They always nested at a distance from the house, and it was almost impossible ever to find their eggs, on account of the extreme circumspection they observed in going to and from their nests; and when they succeeded in escaping foxes, skunks, weasels, and opossums, which, strange to say, they often did, they would rear their chickens away out of sight and hearing of the house, and only bring them home when winter deprived them of their leafy covering and made food scarce. During the summer, in my rambles about the plantation, T would occasionally surprise one of these half-wild hens with her brood; her distracted screams and motions would then cause her chicks to scatter and vanish in all directions, and, until the supposed danger was past, they would lie as close and well-concealed as young partridges. These fowls in summer always lived in small parties, each party composed of one cock and as many hens as he could collect--usually three or four. Each family occupied its own feeding ground, where it would pass a greater portion of each day. The hen would nest at a considerable distance from the feeding ground, sometimes as far as four or five hundred yards away. After laying an egg she would quit the nest, not walking from it as other fowls do, but flying, the flight extending to a distance of from fifteen to about fifty yards; after which, still keeping silence, she would walk or run, until, arrived at the feeding ground, she would begin to cackle. At once the cock, if within hearing, would utter a responsive cackle, whereupon she would run to him and cackle no more. Frequently the cackling call-note would not be uttered {{more than two or three}} times, sometimes only once, and in a much lower tone than in fowls of other breeds.|$|E

50|$|Despite the win and a 23rd-place points finish, RCA {{left the}} sport and Andretti signed with Petty Enterprises. Yarborough signed Greg Sacks to drive his <b>Thorn</b> <b>Apple</b> Valley Ford in 1998, but Sacks {{suffered}} a neck injury at the Texas 500 {{and was unable to}} race {{for the rest of the}} year. Rich Bickle took his place, and had three top-five qualifying runs and a fourth-place finish at Martinsville. Bickle resigned to drive for Tyler Jet Motorsports and <b>Thorn</b> <b>Apple</b> departed due to financial problems within the organization. Due to the lack of financing, Yarborough originally closed his team up, but soon reopened and hired Rick Mast as its driver and car dealer Wayne Burdett as a co-owner. Despite having no primary sponsor, Yarborough and his team ran the full schedule, picking up short-term deals with Sonic Drive-In and Hobas Pipe. Soon after, Burdette left the team and the team signed Universal Studios/Woody Woodpecker as its primary sponsor. At the end of the season, Mast posted two top-tens and did not have a DNF all season, the second driver since Yarborough to accomplish that feat. Despite rumors of a second team with Mike Ciochetti driving, Mast departed for Larry Hedrick Motorsports and Universal left for Team Gordon. Yarborough attempted to sell the team to various businessmen, none of the deals going through. In January 2000, Yarborough closed the team until a buyer could be found. He sold the team in the summer of 2000 to Chip MacPherson, who debuted the new team at Lowe's Motor Speedway with Jeff Fuller, finishing 41st after suffering engine failure.

5000|$|The {{desire of}} a few local steam buffs to {{perpetuate}} the use of steam power necessitated the purchase of suitable land for an annual reunion. Twenty two acres (the present main show grounds) were purchased and hundreds of <b>thorn</b> <b>apple</b> trees cleared. A dam was built in Mud Creek to form Duck Lake {{as a source of}} water for the engines. The group, then called La Porte County Threshermen, held their first show and reunion in 1957. Traction engines were the main feature, and provided most of the power. A sawmill was added in 1959, the electric plant in1961, and the Browning crane in 1962. In 1964, at the suggestion of Bruce Achor, a steam locomotive was purchased from Elliott Donnelley of Lake Forest, IL, who took an interest in the accomplishments at Hesston. During 1965-1968, with the generous financial assistance of Mr. Donnelley, the remainder of the 155 acre site was purchased and a unique dual gauge ( [...] and [...] ) railroad was constructed. The La Porte County Historical Steam Society, Inc. was chartered as a not-for-profit organization on December 16, 1968, and the original La Porte County Threshermen club was absorbed and dissolved.

Bickle competed in 11 events {{over the next three}} years(leading one lap at Charlotte in 1993). 1994 marked a then career-high in terms of starts, driving ten races, most of them for Harry Melling. After years of limited starts, Bickle made the full-time jump to Cup in 1998, driving the #98 <b>Thorn</b> <b>Apple</b> Valley Ford Taurus for Cale Yarborough, replacing Greg Sacks who had been critically injured in an accident at Texas. Bickle had two top-five qualifying efforts and finished a career-best 4th at Martinsville and delivered an emotional post-race interview. When the sponsorship went away, Bickle signed with Tyler Jet Motorsports to drive the #45 10-10-345 Lucky Dog Pontiac. It was an up-and-down year for Bickle and the team; Bickle posted top-10s at the Pontiac Excitement 400 and the Pocono 500. However he had trouble qualifying for races, and after the Pepsi Southern 500 at Darlington, he was released from the team. Bickle drove some for Melling Racing that year. In 2000, Bickle did substitute duty for Joe Bessey's team, and drove one race for Morgan-McClure Motorsports the following year, in addition to driving once for Midwest Transit Racing.|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} was conducted on cotton to test different plant extracts with potential insecticidal properties against bollworms (Noctuidae) and leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) for the use by small-scale, cotton farmers. The study was carried out during the 2006 / 07 and 2007 / 08 seasons at ARC Institute for Industrial Crops, Rustenburg (25 ° 39. 0 S, 27 ° 14. 4 E) in the North West Province of South Africa. Four organic insecticides, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacium), khaki weed (Tagetes minuta), <b>thorn</b> <b>apple</b> (Datura stramonium) and garlic (Allium sativum) were compared with two chemical treatments, Mospilan® (acetamiprid) and Decis® (deltamethrin), and an untreated control. The cultivar, DeltaOPAL, was planted and the trial conducted using standard practices. Overall, Decis® and tobacco treatments exhibited significantly less bollworm larvae than the other treatments. Tobacco was the most promising biological pesticide against American bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) and spiny bollworm (Earias insulana) larvae. All the treatments were significantly effective against the red bollworm (Diparopsis castanea) larvae, but Decis® and Mospilan® provided the best control. Although khaki weed, garlic and <b>thorn</b> <b>apple</b> were promising biological pesticides against the bollworm complex, tobacco was the most effective organic treatment. Mospilan® {{seemed to be more}} effective on the control of leafhoppers (Jacobiella fascialis), followed by Decis® and tobacco. Among the plant extracts, tobacco and garlic gave higher seed cotton yields compared to the khaki weed and <b>thorn</b> <b>apple</b> during both study seasons. In 2006 / 07, none of the treatments reached the corresponding economic threshold levels (ETLs). In contrast, in 2007 / 08, only rarely were the treatments (mostly Decis® and Mospilan®) below the corresponding ETLs. These differences were attributed to the higher rainfall recorded during the 2007 / 08 season, which reduced the effectiveness of the treatments by partly washing away the pesticidal applications. In addition, a high weed infestation also created competition for nutrients in the soil, thus resulting in lower (0. 50 - 1. 25 ton/ha in 2007 / 08 vs 2. 50 - 5. 00 ton/ha in 2006 / 07), but acceptable cotton seed yields. In conclusion, it is suggested that some plant extracts (particularly from tobacco and garlic) {{can be used as a}} cheaper and more environment-friendly alternative to chemical insecticides for the control of bollworms and leafhoppers, although it has been demonstrated that their efficacy do not reach the one of chemical treatments. Further research in the near future is recommended...|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to its traditional medicinal importance, Solanum incanum (<b>thorn</b> <b>apple)</b> is also {{a rich source of}} important cytotoxic glycoalkaloids such as solamargine and solasonine. The effect of salinity stress on solamargine and solasonine production by Solanum incanum plants grown in soil has been investigated. Salinity stress has been applied by adding NaCl to the soil, in concentrations: 0. 0 (control), 75, 150, and 225 mM for 8 weeks. HPTLC method was used for analysis of solamargine and solasonine in leaves, stem and roots. A positive correlation was observed between 150 mM NaCl salinity and production of solamargine and solasonine in leaves. In roots, solamargine content was not affected by NaCl treatment, whereas solasonine content increased with a short-term salinity treatment. However, salinity seems to reduce the production of solamargine and solasonine in the roots of Solanum incanum.

40|$|The host {{suitability}} {{of five of}} the most common weed species occurring in maize (Zea mays L.) fields in South Africa to Pratylenchus zeae was tested. Based on the number of nematodes per root unit, mealie crotalaria (Crotalaria sphaerocarpa) was a good host; goose grass (Eleusine indica), common pigweed (Amaranthus hybridus), and <b>thorn</b> <b>apple</b> (Datura stramonium) were moderate hosts; and khaki weed (Tagetes minuta) was a poor host. Only the root residues of khaki weed suppressed the P. zeae infestation of subsequently grown maize. When goose grass, khaki weed, and mealie crotalaria were grown in association with maize in soil infested with P. zeae, goose grass and khaki weed severely suppressed maize root development; this resulted in a low number of nematodes per maize root system and a high number of nematodes per maize root unit. Mealie crotalaria did not restrict maize root growth and did not affect nematode densities per maize root system or maize root unit. Special attention should be given to the control of mealie crotalaria, which is a good host for P. zeae, and goose grass, which, in addition to its ability to compete with maize, is also a suitable host for P. zeae...|$|E
