40|$|Several {{thousand}} ancient tombs and ruins {{remain at}} this time in Hiuga Province (Miyazaki Pref.), where many archaeologists haunt for pursuing their archaeological studies. Among the relics of antiquity <b>the</b> ancient <b>charcoals</b> are of frequent discovery. <b>The</b> <b>charcoals</b> are found at the remains of the ancient dwelling, the smeltering mill and the wall of coffin room of the ancient tombs. The present article deals with the anatomical and physical features of ancient <b>charcoals</b> along with <b>the</b> judgement for the classification. The results obtained are briefly summarized as follows: (1) <b>The</b> <b>charcoals</b> was certainly utilized to a great extent for metallurgy in ancient times, for <b>the</b> soft <b>charcoals</b> and <b>the</b> <b>charcoals</b> made from coniferous wood are at times found. (2) The materials for charcoal-making were probably got from the forest near the dwelling. (3) The charcoal-making by open process was in all probability prevalent in ancient times. (4) <b>The</b> ancient <b>charcoal</b> made from oak is 202 ̆ 7 in hardness, and ranks with <b>the</b> best present <b>charcoal,</b> such as Bincho-tan made by charcoal-making in kiln with the presentday highest technics [...] It is great wonder that such a charcoal of good quality was made by ancient peoples in olden times more than a thousand years ago. 1. 出土炭は概ね軟質の木炭であり樹その中でも樹種として針葉樹が特に多い. 依つて当時の木炭用途は鉄文化の推進(冶金鍛冶など) に寄与した具体的事実を示すものである. 2. 原料樹種は甚だ李凡で特殊なものは存在しない. これは当時近辺の豊富な自生林より資材を採つたもので, 決して遠地から木炭又は資材を搬入したものでないと思はれる. 3. 未炭化木炭(幡火の遺物とも考へられんこともないが) 軟質炭,枝條炭(小丸) などが多く出土することは当時蓋無し製炭法(竪穴式) の類が盛んに採用されたのであらう. 4. 斯く多数の軟質炭が出土するかと思うと, 西都原(No. 7) のカシ小丸と恒富(No. 9) のカナクギノキ炭とは形態硬度の点から明かに白炭(窯外消化法) である. 殊に前者のカシ炭の硬度は現代の製炭技術の粋と目せらるる和歌山縣備長炭に匹敵するのであるが, 既に千数百年前の古代に於て此の種の高級技術が習熟体得されていたことは日向古代文化の大いなる在り方を推知する好個の資料であると考へる...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} properties such as moisture content, ash content, volatile matter, fixed carbon and specific surface area were investigated on <b>the</b> spent grain <b>charcoal,</b> Ca(OH) 2 added spent grain <b>charcoal</b> and <b>the</b> sawdust <b>charcoal.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> burning properties of these <b>charcoals</b> were examined. <b>The</b> spent grain <b>charcoal</b> contains fixed carbon of 81 % and ash of 12 %, and the ash content is fairly high {{compared with that}} in <b>the</b> sawdust <b>charcoal.</b> <b>The</b> ash content increases to about 16 % when Ca(OH) 2 is added to <b>the</b> spent grain <b>charcoal.</b> <b>The</b> ash of spent grain charcoal contains 47 % of P, 22 % of Ca, 14 % of Mg, 13 % of Si and others. The thermal analysis gives a superior information on the ignition and burning properties. <b>The</b> spent grain <b>charcoal</b> is inferior to <b>the</b> sawdust <b>charcoal</b> in <b>the</b> burning property of the ignition temperature and the burning period, because the ignition temperature is higher and the burning period is longer.

25|$|Brazil. Eucalyptus was {{introduced}} to Brazil in 1910, for timber substitution and <b>the</b> <b>charcoal</b> industry. It has thrived in the local environment, and today there are around 7 million hectares planted. The wood is highly valued by <b>the</b> <b>charcoal</b> and pulp and paper industries. The short rotation allows a larger wood production and supplies wood for several other activities, helping to preserve the native forests from logging. When well managed, the plantation soils can sustain endless replanting. Eucalyptus plantings are also used as wind breaks. Brazil's plantations have world-record rates of growth, typically over 40 cubic metres per hectare per year, and commercial harvesting occurs after years 5. Due to continual development and governmental funding, year-on-year growth is consistently being improved. Eucalyptus can produce up to 100 cubic metres per hectare per year. Brazil has become the top exporter and producer of Eucalyptus round wood and pulp, and has {{played an important role}} in developing the Australian market through the country's committed research in this area. The local iron producers in Brazil rely heavily on sustainably grown Eucalyptus for charcoal; this has greatly pushed up the price of charcoal in recent years. The plantations are generally owned and operated for national and international industry by timber asset companies such as Thomson Forestry, Greenwood Management or cellulose producers such as Aracruz Cellulose and Stora Enso.|$|E

40|$|International audienceCharcoals {{that contain}} calcium {{compounds}} have been synthesized by impregnating wood with calcium chloride followed by carbonization at 500 degrees C, 650 degrees C or 900 degrees C. <b>The</b> <b>charcoals</b> {{were characterized by}} SEM, EDAX, XRD and chemical titrations. These adsorbents were porous with the wood microstructure. XRD revealed the presence of crystallized CaCO(3) and CaO.

25|$|Some {{archaeologists have}} {{questioned}} these dates.

Pettitt and Bahn also contended that the dating is inconsistent with the traditional stylistic sequence {{and that there is}} uncertainty about the source of <b>the</b> <b>charcoal</b> used in the drawings and the extent of surface contamination on the exposed rock surfaces.

25|$|A {{charcoal}} briquette, or briquet is a {{block of}} flammable charcoal matter which is used as fuel to start and maintain a fire, mainly used for food preparation over an open fire or a barbecue. Charcoal briquettes are made by using a process which consists of compressing charcoal, typically made from sawdust and other wood by-products, with a binder and other additives. The binder is usually starch. Some charcoal briquettes may also include brown coal, mineral carbon, borax, sodium nitrate, limestone, raw sawdust, and other additives like paraffin or petroleum solvents to aid in ignition. The design of <b>the</b> <b>charcoal</b> briquette was invented and patented by Ellsworth B. A. Zwoyer in 1897.|$|E
25|$|In operation, the {{bloomery}} is preheated {{by burning}} charcoal, and once hot, iron ore and additional charcoal are introduced through the top, in a roughly one-to-one ratio. Inside the furnace, carbon monoxide from the incomplete combustion of <b>the</b> <b>charcoal</b> reduces the iron oxides in the ore to metallic iron, without melting the ore; {{this allows the}} bloomery to operate at lower temperatures than the melting temperature of the ore. Since the desired product of a bloomery is easily forgeable, nearly pure iron, with a low carbon content, the temperature and ratio of charcoal to iron ore must be carefully controlled to keep the iron from absorbing the carbon and becoming unforgeable. Limestone could also {{be added to the}} bloomery, about 10% of the ore weight, which would act as flux and help carry away impurities.|$|E

25|$|An African slave named Stephan {{changed the}} process of curing the Bright Leaf tobacco variety (a lighter flavored tobacco leaf) by curing it with {{charcoal}} taken from a local blacksmith's fire rather than the usual logwood. This fire burned hotter and faster and accelerated the curing process. The process was refined further to include a furnace in which heat from <b>the</b> <b>charcoal</b> was applied through flues, so that dark soot and off flavors did not {{come in contact with}} the tobacco. This changed the curing process of a lighter leaf and produced a new, lighter tobacco which was able to be inhaled. This, linked together with the British Victorian desire for cigarettes, along with the aforementioned French and other European countries, gave way to an emerging market to minced tobacco. This trend had not yet hit America for its export market.|$|E
25|$|Biochar is {{charcoal}} {{produced at}} relatively low temperatures from a biomass {{of wood and}} leafy plant materials in an environment with very low or no oxygen. Amending soil with biochar has been observed to increase the activity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Tests of high porosity materials such as zeolite, activated carbon, and charcoal show that microbial growth substantially improves with charcoal. It may be that small pieces of charcoal migrate within the soil, providing a habitat for bacteria that decompose the biomass in the surface ground cover. This process may have {{an essential role in}} terra preta's self-propagation; a virtuous cycle develops as the fungus spreads from <b>the</b> <b>charcoal,</b> fixing additional carbon, stabilizing the soil with glomalin, and increasing nutrient availability for nearby plants. Many other agents contribute, from earthworms to humans as well as the charring process.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, O'Keeffe {{began her}} serious formal art {{training}} at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and then the Art Students League of New York, but she felt constrained by her lessons that focused on recreating or copying what was in nature. In 1908, unable to fund further education, she worked for two years as a commercial illustrator, and then spent seven years between 1911 and 1918 teaching in Virginia, Texas, and South Carolina. During that time, she studied art during the summers between 1912 and 1914 and {{was introduced to the}} principles and philosophies of Arthur Wesley Dow, who espoused created works of art based upon personal style, design, and interpretation of subjects, rather than trying to copy or represent them. This caused a major change in the way she felt about and approached art, as seen in the beginning stages of her watercolors from her studies at the University of Virginia and more dramatically in <b>the</b> <b>charcoal</b> drawings that she produced in 1915 that led to total abstraction.
