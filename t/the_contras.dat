5|$|Both {{the sale}} of weapons to Iran, and the funding of <b>the</b> <b>Contras,</b> {{attempted}} to circumvent not only stated administration policy, but also the Boland Amendment. Administration officials argued that regardless of the Congress restricting the funds for <b>the</b> <b>Contras,</b> or any affair, the President (or {{in this case the}} administration) could carry on by seeking alternative means of funding such as private entities and foreign governments. Funding from one foreign country, Brunei, was botched when North's secretary, Fawn Hall, transposed the numbers of North's Swiss bank account number. A Swiss businessman, suddenly $10 million richer, alerted the authorities of the mistake. The money was eventually returned to the Sultan of Brunei, with interest.|$|E
5|$|Ferraro took {{a congressional}} trip to Nicaragua {{at the start}} of 1984, where she spoke to <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> She decided that the Reagan Administration's {{military}} interventions there and in El Salvador were counterproductive towards reaching U.S. security goals, and that regional negotiations would be better.|$|E

5|$|At this point, McCain's {{politics}} were mainly {{in line with}} President Ronald Reagan; this included support for Reaganomics, and he was active on Indian Affairs bills. He supported most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts, such as backing <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> in Nicaragua. McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon citing unattainable objectives, and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late; in the interim, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds. McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984, and gained {{a spot on the}} House Foreign Affairs Committee. In 1985, he made his first return trip to Vietnam, and also traveled to Chile where he met with its military junta ruler, General Augusto Pinochet.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy easily {{defeated}} Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win {{re-election in}} 1982. Senate leaders granted him {{a seat on}} the Armed Services Committee, while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union. A 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media. Andropov was unimpressed by the idea.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{took great}} care to shape {{perceptions}} of himself. He permitted and encouraged rumors {{that as the}} chief of intelligence, he was in possession of negative information about everybody in the country. Dinges suggests that the impression among some officials that Noriega made money off of every transaction in the country may have been cultivated by Noriega himself. Among opposition leaders in Panama he was seen variously as a sexual pervert, as a sadist, and a rapist. Within U.S. government circles contradictory images abounded; Noriega {{was seen as a}} CIA spy, a drug trafficker, a nationalist supporting Torrijos, an ally of Cuba, and an ally of Oliver North and <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> He was perceived as a trusted collaborator in the war against drugs, even as the DEA was investigating him for involvement in smuggling. By the time of his removal he had come to be hated in the U.S., and the invasion was portrayed as an attempt to remove an evil man. Dinges writes that these contradictory images played a large role in the U.S. government's self-contradictory policy towards Noriega.|$|E

5000|$|C: <b>The</b> <b>Contra</b> Adventure {{received}} several negative reviews during its release. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot gave the game an overall score of 3.6/10.0, stating that [...] "It's {{hard to believe}} that Konami would release yet another sorry game with <b>the</b> <b>Contra</b> name on it". Randy Nelson of IGN gave it a 1.0, saying [...] "Definitely not <b>the</b> game <b>Contra</b> fans have been clamoring for". Jeremy Parish and Sam Kennedy, in their Contra retrospective for 1up.com, wrote [...] "C: <b>The</b> <b>Contra</b> Adventure managed to be even worse than Legacy of War, giving it the distinction of being the worst game in the series".|$|R

5|$|Several {{investigations}} ensued, including by the U.S. Congress and the three-person, Reagan-appointed Tower Commission. Neither {{found any}} evidence that President Reagan himself knew {{of the extent of}} the multiple programs. Ultimately the sale of weapons to Iran was not deemed a criminal offense but charges were brought against five individuals for their support of <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> Those charges, however, were later dropped because the administration refused to declassify certain documents. The indicted conspirators faced various lesser charges instead. In the end, fourteen administration officials were indicted, including then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Eleven convictions resulted, some of which were vacated on appeal. The rest of those indicted or convicted were all pardoned {{in the final days of}} the presidency of George H.W. Bush, who had been Vice President at the time of the affair. The Iran-Contra Affair and the ensuing deception to protect senior administration officials including President Reagan has been cast as an example of post-truth politics.|$|E
5|$|The report {{published}} by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26, 1987. The Commission had interviewed 80 witnesses to the scheme, including Reagan, {{and two of the}} arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was the most comprehensive of any released, criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially about the diversion of funds to <b>the</b> <b>Contras,</b> although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more, thereby placing more {{power in the hands of}} that chair.|$|E
25|$|During {{their war}} against the Nicaraguan government, <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> {{committed}} {{a large number of}} human rights violations and used terrorist tactics, carrying out more than 1300 terrorist attacks. These actions were frequently carried out systematically {{as a part of the}} strategy of <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> Supporters of <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> tried to downplay these violations, particularly the Reagan administration in the US, which engaged in a campaign of white propaganda to alter public opinion in favor of <b>the</b> <b>contras.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{front of}} the International Court of Justice, Nicaragua claimed that <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> were {{altogether}} a creation of the U.S. This claim was rejected. However, the evidence of a very close relationship between <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> and the United States was considered overwhelming and incontrovertible. The U.S. played a very large role in financing, training, arming, and advising <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> over a long period, and <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> only became capable of carrying out significant military operations {{as a result of}} this support.|$|E
25|$|In August 1989, {{the month}} that campaigning began, <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> redeployed 8,000 troops into Nicaragua, after a funding boost from Washington, {{continued}} their guerrilla war. 50 FSLN candidates were assassinated. <b>The</b> <b>Contras</b> also distributed thousands of UNO leaflets.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the case}} for support of <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> {{continued}} {{to be made in}} Washington, D.C., by both the Reagan administration and The Heritage Foundation, which argued that support for <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> would counter Soviet influence in Nicaragua.|$|E

25|$|The Reagan administration's {{support for}} <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> {{continued}} to stir controversy {{well into the}} 1990s. In August 1996, San Jose Mercury News reporter Gary Webb published a series titled Dark Alliance, alleging that <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> contributed {{to the rise of}} crack cocaine in California.|$|E
25|$|By 1986 <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> were {{besieged by}} charges of corruption, human-rights abuses, and {{military}} ineptitude. A much-vaunted early 1986 offensive never materialized, and Contra forces were largely reduced to isolated acts of terrorism. In October 1987, however, <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> staged a successful attack in southern Nicaragua. Then on 21 December 1987, the FDN launched attacks at La Bonanza, La Siuna, and La Rosita in Zelaya province, resulting in heavy fighting. ARDE Frente Sur attacked at El Almendro {{and along the}} Rama road. These large-scale raids mainly became possible as <b>the</b> <b>contras</b> {{were able to use}} U.S.-provided Redeye missiles against Sandinista Mi-24 helicopter gunships, which had been supplied by the Soviets. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> remained tenuously encamped within Honduras and weren't able to hold Nicaraguan territory.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, {{legislation}} was enacted by US Congress to prohibit further direct aid to <b>the</b> <b>Contras.</b> Reagan's officials attempted to illegally supply {{them out of}} the proceeds of arms sales to Iran and third party donations, triggering the Iran-Contra Affair of 1986–87. Mutual exhaustion, Sandinista fears of Contra unity and military success, and mediation by other regional governments led to the Sapoa ceasefire between the Sandinistas and <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> on March 23, 1988. Subsequent agreements were designed to reintegrate <b>the</b> <b>Contras</b> and their supporters into Nicaraguan society in preparation for general elections.|$|E
