5|$|In 2003, Jackson {{was accused}} {{of child sexual abuse}} and was acquitted two years later. During the investigation, Jackson's profile was {{examined}} by Stan Katz, a mental health professional, who spent several hours with the accuser as well. According to Taraborrelli, the assessment made by Katz was that Jackson had become a regressed ten-year-old. Some medical professionals have publicly stated <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> Jackson also had body dysmorphic disorder, a psychological condition whereby the sufferer has no concept of how his or her physical appearance is perceived by others.|$|E
5|$|Soaring {{demand for}} coffee and rubber brought Brazil an influx of revenue in the early 1900s. Simultaneously, there was a drive {{on the part of}} {{prominent}} Brazilians, most notably the Baron of Rio Branco, to have the country recognized as an international power. A large naval acquisition program was drawn up and passed by the National Congress of Brazil in October 1904 in accordance with <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> a powerful navy would be crucial to the achievement of this goal, but it was two years before any ships were ordered.|$|E

5|$|The company {{focuses on}} {{creating}} video games that provoke emotional responses from players. Its employees have stated that, {{while they are}} not opposed to making action-oriented games, they believe that enough such titles are released by the established video game industry. When designing a game, Thatgamecompany employees start by mapping out what they want the player to feel, rather than by establishing game mechanics. Employees have stated that the company does not plan to produce large, blockbuster titles, due to <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the pressure for high sales would stifle innovation.|$|E

Among servants and former servants of the Tichborne family called by Ballantine was John Moore, Roger's valet in South America. He testified that the Claimant had remembered many small details of their months together, including clothing worn {{and the name of}} a pet dog the pair had adopted. Roger's cousin Anthony Biddulph explained that he had accepted the Claimant only after spending much time in his company.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after his arrival, Hess began exhibiting amnesia, {{which may have}} been feigned in the hope of avoiding the death sentence. Medical personnel who examined Hess reported he was not insane and was fit to stand trial. At least two examiners, the British doctor and the Soviet one, noted <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> Hess's amnesia might be fake. Efforts were made to trigger his memory, including bringing in his former secretaries and showing old newsreels, but he persisted in showing no response to these stimuli. When Hess was allowed to make a statement to the tribunal on 30 November, he admitted that he had faked memory loss as a tactic. He spoke to the tribunal again on 31 August 1946, the last day of closing statements.|$|E
5|$|In 1694, two Franciscan friars set {{out from}} Guatemala {{to see if they}} could succeed where the Dominicans had failed. Antonio Margil and Melchor López left Cobán in August 1693 to seek out the hostile Lakandon Ch'ols in the depths of the rainforest. Antionio Margil had already spent two years among the Manche Ch'ol. Although they found the Lakandon, the mission was a failure and the friars were forced to flee. Disappointed by their failure, in April 1694 the friars wrote a letter to the {{president}} of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, Jacinto de Barrios Leal, stating <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> any further peaceful attempts at converting the Ch'ol peoples were pointless, and that the time had come for military action.|$|E
5|$|Charged {{with the}} crime of heresy, based on her claim of visions and signs from God, she is tried in an ecclesiastical court proceeding, which is forced by the English {{occupation}} government. The English wish to quickly condemn and execute Joan since English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive, based on <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison. Bishop Cauchon expresses his fear of wrongfully executing someone who might have received visions from God. About to be burned for heresy, Joan is distraught {{that she will be}} executed without making a final confession. The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he can hear her confession. Joan signs the recantation. The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English, saying that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic. Whilst in her cell, Joan is confronted by an unnamed cloaked man (Dustin Hoffman), who is implied to be Joan's conscience. The man makes Joan question whether she was actually receiving messages from God.|$|E

5|$|Dancing is {{a popular}} pastime in Wales; {{traditional}} dances include folk dancing and clog dancing. The first mention of dancing in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis, but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out; this is attributed {{to the influence of}} Nonconformists and <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> any physical diversion was worthless and satanic, especially mixed dancing. These ancient dances, orally passed down, were almost single-handedly rescued by Lois Blake (1890–1974) who recorded them in numerous instruction pamphlets, recording both steps and music. In a similar vein, clog dancing was preserved and developed by the likes of Howel Wood (1882–1967) who perpetuated the art at local and national stages. Clog dancing, traditionally a male dominated art, is now a common part of eisteddfodau. In 2010, a 30-year traditional dance festival held in Caernarvon came to an end {{due to a lack of}} participants, though clog dancing has seen a revival in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|During the Duke's {{march to}} the Danube Emperor LeopoldI offered to make Marlborough a prince of the Holy Roman Empire in the small principality of Mindelheim. The Queen enthusiastically agreed to this elevation, but after the successes of 1704, the {{campaign}} of 1705 brought little reason for satisfaction on the Continent. The planned invasion of France via the Moselle valley was frustrated by friend and foe alike, forcing the Duke to withdraw back towards the Low Countries. Although Marlborough penetrated the Lines of Brabant at Elixheim in July, Allied indecision and considerable Dutch hesitancy (concerned as they were {{for the security of}} their homeland), prevented the Duke from pressing his advantage. The French and the Tories in England dismissed arguments that only Dutch obstructionism had robbed Marlborough of a great victory in 1705, confirmed in <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> Blenheim had been a lucky strike and that Marlborough was a general not to be feared.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, he {{published}} his first novel, Carnuntum, in two volumes. Set {{in the late}} fourth century CE, the narrative focused on a romance set {{against the background of}} the conflict between Germanic tribes and the Roman Empire around the area of the eponymous Roman fort. The novel established List as a recognised figure within Austria's Pan-German community, a movement of individuals unified in <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the majority German-speaking areas of the multi-linguistic and multi-ethnic Austro-Hungarian state should cede and join with the newly established German Empire. The book also brought him to the attention of Friedrich Wannieck, a wealthy industrialist who was the chairman of both the Prague Iron Company and the First Brno Engineering Company. Wannieck was also president of the Verein 'Deutsches Haus' ("'German House' Association"), a nationalist organisation of linguistically German inhabitants of Brno who felt encircled by the largely Czech population of South Moravia. List and Wannieck began corresponding, resulting in a lifelong friendship between the two men. The Verein 'Deutsches Haus' subsequently published three of List's works in its series on German nationalist studies of history and literature.|$|E

25|$|Dupas' lawyer, David Drake, {{advised the}} inquest {{that the only}} {{evidence}} linking Dupas {{to the murder of}} Halvagis was the fact that Dupas had lived nearby to the Fawkner Cemetery, and his reputation based on prior convictions for similar offences.

25|$|Christian Scriptures record {{nothing about}} the Biblical Magi after {{reporting}} their going back to their own countries.

5|$|Initially, screenwriter Dan Sterling {{wrote his}} script {{based on a}} fake {{dictator}} from a fake country, but Rogen, Goldberg, and Sony executives asked him to rewrite the script focusing on Kim. The screenplay was then titled Kill Kim Jong Un. Previous iterations of the story revolved around Kim Jong-il, but put the project on hold until Jong-il died and his son Kim Jong-un assumed power in 2011. Development resumed when Rogen and Goldberg realized that Jong-un is closer to their own age, which they felt would be more humorous. To write the story, co-written with Daily Show writer Dan Sterling, they researched meticulously by reading non-fiction books and watching video footage about North Korea. The script was later reviewed by an employee in the State Department. Rogen and Goldberg aimed to make the project more relevant and satirical than their previous films while retaining toilet humor. They were pleased when former NBA star Dennis Rodman visited North Korea, as it reinforced <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> {{the premise of the}} film was realistic.|$|E
5|$|The Stavka {{developed}} {{two major}} operations {{to be conducted}} against Axis forces near Stalingrad, Uranus and Saturn, and also planned for Operation Mars designed to engage German Army Group Center {{in an effort to}} distract reinforcements and to inflict as much damage as possible. Operation Uranus involved the use of large Soviet mechanized and infantry forces to encircle German and other Axis forces directly around Stalingrad. As preparations for the offensive commenced, the attack's starting points were positioned on stretches of front {{to the rear of the}} German Sixth Army, largely preventing the Germans from reinforcing those sectors quickly where Axis units were too overstretched to occupy effectively. The offensive was a double envelopment; Soviet mechanized forces would penetrate deep into the German rear, while another attack would be made closer to the German Sixth Army in an effort to attack German units there directly in the rear. While the Red Army prepared, the German high commanders—influenced by <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> the Red Army, building up opposite Germany Army Group Center to the north, was incapable of mounting a simultaneous offensive in the south—continued to deny the possibility of an impending Soviet offensive.|$|E
5|$|Khal Drogo, delirious from an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} chest wound inflicted by Mago, falls from his saddle, {{a sign of weakness}} among the Dothraki. Daenerys takes Drogo into her tent and sends for Mirri Maz Duur to help him. However, Ser Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys that they should leave now because the Dothraki only respect the physically strong. He explains that, if Drogo dies, Qotho and the other bloodriders will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill her and her unborn child to prevent Drogo's son from growing up to be a rival. Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband, even when Mirri tells Daenerys that she cannot save him and instead advises giving Drogo a quick, clean death. In desperation, Daenerys encourages Mirri to use blood magic despite Mirri's warning about the consequences of such a spell, that only death can pay for life. Mirri brings Drogo's horse into the tent, slits its throat, orders everyone to leave, and warns that none must enter during the spell. Qotho, shocked at what Daenerys has done, tries to stop the spell, but Mormont kills him to prevent interference. Daenerys then goes into premature labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives help her, owing to <b>their</b> <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> she is cursed. In desperation, Mormont carries Daenerys into Drogo's tent to seek Mirri's help.|$|E

50|$|The Maidu {{inhabited}} {{areas in}} northeastern Sierra Nevada. This {{area and the}} sites they occupied contain many examples of rock art and petroglyphs. There is some confusion on whether this rock art and other site remains are from previous populations of peoples or from the Maidu people themselves. Regardless, the Maidu people incorporated these works into their cultural system, due to <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> artifacts are real, living energies that {{are an integral part}} of their world.|$|R
50|$|Huron {{communities}} {{changed the}} location of their village every ten to fifteen years. They believed {{that they had to}} protect their dead when they moved, and they started to rebury them every time a large village migrated.

The symbolism of the end of winter and start of spring fit into <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> separated the living and the dead.|$|R

50|$|Pierre de Lancre and Francesco Maria Guazzo {{believed}} that it was enough proof of a witch's guilt if they had parents who were witches. They believed witch parents introduced the children to Satan, took the children to Sabbats, married children to demons, inspired the children to have sex with Satan(devil) or had sex with Satan with the child present. Many times the child accused of witchcraft, due to being shunned, threatened community members, thereby enforcing <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> the child was a witch.|$|R
5000|$|Another Shia sect, the Zaidiyyah, {{followers}} of Zaid ibn Ali, accept Umar and Abu Bakr as legitimate caliphs, despite <b>their</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> they are inferior to Ali.

This seems related {{to the sort of}} gnostic ideas held by Basilides or Valentinus. Later Marcionite ideas described by the Armenian Eznik (or Yeznik Koghbatsi) seem similar to this.|$|R
