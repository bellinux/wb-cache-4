25|$|To {{create a}} {{circular}} polarizer that instead passes right-handed polarized light and absorbs left-handed light, one again rotates the wave plate and linear polarizer 90° relative to each another. It is easy <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>that</b> by reversing {{the positions of}} the transmitting and absorbing axes of the linear polarizer relative to the quarter-wave plate, one changes which handedness of polarized light gets transmitted and which gets absorbed.|$|E
25|$|Puyi rarely {{left the}} Forbidden City, {{knew nothing of}} the lives of {{ordinary}} Chinese people, and was somewhat misled by Johnston who told him {{that the vast majority of}} the Chinese wanted a Qing restoration. Johnston, a Sinophile scholar and a romantic conservative with an instinctive preference for monarchies, believed that China needed a benevolent autocrat to guide the country forward, leading him to favor a Qing restoration. Johnston was enough of a traditionalist <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>that</b> all of the major events in the Forbidden City were determined by the court astrologers as life in the Forbidden City was still decided by the way of the stars. The Sinophile Johnston disparaged the superficially Westernized Chinese republican elite who dressed in top hats, frock coats and business suits as inauthentically Chinese and praised to Puyi the Confucian scholars with their traditional robes as the ones who were authentically Chinese.|$|E

25|$|On 20 May, the French {{crossed to}} the north bank of the Sambre and took up a {{position}} facing west with the left flank resting on Erquelinnes and the right flank at the Bonne-Espérance Abbey. The following day Kaunitz mounted {{an attack on the}} new French position. The French were chased out of Erquelinnes but later recaptured the village and stopped the Coalition attack. Kléber suggested using Mayer's unengaged division near Bonne-Espérance to launch a counterattack on Kaunitz's left flank. But since Mayer belonged to the Army of the Ardennes, Desjardin declined to give the general a direct order. The order had to pass through Charbonnier, who was so far away that {{it was too late to}} do anything. Vezú's division was at Fontaine-l'Évêque and Charbonnier was preoccupied rounding up cattle and horses. There is evidence from his correspondence that Charbonnier was jealous of his authority as army commander-in-chief and was reluctant to follow Pichegru's instructions. He considered his army as an autonomous force and failed <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>that</b> he must cooperate with Desjardin to gain success.|$|E
500|$|Bowlby's {{original}} {{account of}} a sensitivity period during which attachments can form of between six months and {{two to three years}} has been modified by later researchers. These researchers have shown that there is indeed a sensitive period during which attachments will form if possible, but the time frame is broader and the effect less fixed and irreversible than first proposed. With further research, authors discussing attachment theory have come <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>that</b> social development is affected by later as well as earlier relationships. Early steps in attachment take place most easily if the infant has one caregiver, or the occasional care of a small number of other people. According to Bowlby, almost from the first many children have more than one figure toward whom they direct attachment behaviour. These figures are not treated alike; there is a strong bias for a child to direct attachment behaviour mainly toward one particular person. Bowlby used the term [...] "monotropy" [...] to describe this bias. Researchers and theorists have abandoned this concept insofar as it may be taken to mean that the relationship with the special figure differs qualitatively from that of other figures. Rather, current thinking postulates definite hierarchies of relationships.|$|E
2500|$|The Army failed <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>that</b> {{the naval}} [...] {{ammunition}} {{was not in}} its inventory until after the guns had already been produced. It asked Krupp to modify the guns to use its standard [...] ammunition, but it proved uneconomic to do so. It deployed the guns in fixed locations, i.e. on coast-defense duties, [...] to minimize the burden on its logistical system. Ultimately the Army ordered eight 21cm replacement barrels, but only four had been built before six weapons were captured or destroyed during the Battle of Normandy and the whole exercise became futile. It used the German naval system of ammunition where the base charge was held in a metallic cartridge case and supplemented by another charge in a silk bag which was rammed first.|$|E

She befriends the two {{children}} living next door: Tommy and Annika Settergren. The three have many adventures. Tommy and Annika's mother, Mrs. Settergren, often disapproves of Pippi's manners and lack of education, but Mrs. Settergren eventually comes <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>that</b> Pippi would never put Tommy and Annika in danger, and that Pippi values her friendship with the pair above almost anything else in her life. Pippi's two main possessions are a suitcase full of gold coins (which she used to buy her horse) and a large chest of drawers containing various small treasures.|$|E
2500|$|Meena Kumari {{agreed to}} all terms, but with passing time she kept {{breaking}} them. It is said Kumari felt oppressed by the feudal attitude and high-handed behavior that Kamal Amrohi brought to their relationship. Kamal Amrohi's lavish productions Daera and Pakeezah, and his Kamalistan studios (1958) were mostly financed by Kumari's earnings. Meena Kumari was watched over. Kamal Amrohi had issued strict instructions and had deployed assistant Baqar Ali {{to prevent any}} other man from meeting Meena Kumari on the sets. In 1972 Kamal Amrohi told Vinod Mehta (writer of Meena Kumari - The Classic Biography) [...] "I didn't mean it like that. These were just ground rules. I mean, if she returned home at 7 instead of 6:30 it was acceptable for me. I just wanted her <b>to</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>that</b> besides having responsibilities to her career, she had responsibilities to her home and husband". Amrohi further {{said that he was}} prepared to overlook Meena bending his conditions, but he would have loved it if she herself confessed when such bendings took place.
