5|$|In 1993, the Summer Wine Appreciation Society {{asked their}} members for their {{favourite}} musical themes from Last of the Summer Wine. Ronnie Hazlehurst used the resulting list for an independently released CD collection, which was released {{under the name}} Last of the Summer Wine: Music from the TV Show. BBC Radio released audio-only versions of episodes starting in 1995. Peter Sallis provided narration {{to compensate for the}} loss of <b>the</b> <b>televised</b> visual elements.

5|$|On June 24, WWE {{announced}} {{on its website}} that a supplemental draft would take place on June 25 at noon ET. The supplemental draft, like the previous year, was conducted randomly, with each brand receiving random draft selections. Wrestlers affected by <b>the</b> <b>televised</b> draft were exempt from the supplemental draft. Because professional wrestling is scripted, outcomes are usually predetermined. Unlike years past, during this draft, many employees in WWE were not told whether they were scripted to change brands.|$|E
50|$|Selected matches were <b>televised</b> {{solely by}} <b>the</b> BBC, {{for the last}} time.

5|$|SVT begins {{looking for}} songs nine {{months before the}} start of <b>the</b> <b>televised</b> Melodifestival (within days of the {{previous}} year's Eurovision final). The deadline for submission is in September and songs can be in any language. In the pre-selection, song length is limited to three minutes and twenty seconds; songs must be shortened to three minutes if they reach the final twenty-eight and qualifying songs may also be remixed.|$|E
5|$|TVR {{opened the}} {{submission}} period for artists' and composers' entries between 20 December 2016 and 22 January 2017. 84 were received, and each artist participated in <b>the</b> <b>televised</b> audition stage. The auditions were held between 27 January and 29 January 2017, and broadcast {{on a number}} of Romanian television channels between 5 February and 11 February 2017. From these songs, 15 qualified for the semi-finals held on 26 February where a jury determined the ten songs that qualified for the final held on 5 March 2017. The winner was then determined solely by televoting.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>televised</b> Melodifestival lasts {{five weeks}} and {{consists}} of six live shows: four semifinals, in which eight songs compete; a Second Chance round featuring songs which narrowly missed out on qualification from the semifinals; and a grand final. Ten songs comprise the final: two automatic qualifiers {{from each of the}} semifinals, and the two most popular songs in the Second Chance round. In 2015, there are seven songs for each semifinal, and twelve (eight winners and four from Andra Chansen) in the final.|$|E

5|$|A free buffet for {{servicemen}} {{was provided}} {{at the station}} during both World Wars. The Preston Station Free Buffet Association served free hot drinks, biscuits and buns and sold sandwiches at cost price to anyone in uniform 24 {{hours a day for}} the duration of the First World War. Four hundred women working 12-hour shifts served over 3million men between 1915 and 1919. 12million cups of tea were served between 1939 and 1945. It was funded by subscription and had its own marked crockery. The station was on a major north-south route for troops. There are three commemorative plaques related to the First World War buffet in the waiting room on platforms 3 and 4, the former site of WWI buffet. One of the drama segments of <b>the</b> <b>televised</b> Preston Passion of 2012 was set in the First World War servicemen's buffet. The Second World War buffet was located in the southern building further down platforms 5&6 (now platforms 3&4).|$|E
5|$|On May 28, Bonds passed Ruth, {{hitting his}} 715th career home run to center field off Colorado Rockies pitcher Byung-hyun Kim. The ball was hit an {{estimated}} 445feet (140m) into center field where {{it went through}} the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in center field. Then it rolled off the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball {{while he was in}} line at a concession stand. Mysteriously, radio broadcaster Dave Flemming's radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But <b>the</b> <b>televised</b> version, called by Giants broadcaster Duane Kuiper, was not affected.|$|E

5|$|Overall, 36 draft {{selections}} were made, {{the most}} since the original draft in 2002 (which featured 57 selections). Twelve selections {{were made on}} television; six were made by Raw, five by SmackDown, and one by ECW. All of the draftees were wrestlers: 28 males (10 drafted on television) and 8 females (2 drafted on television). Raw obtained the first overall {{pick in the draft}} by winning the first match, which resulted in the acquisition of United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter from SmackDown. Women's Champion Melina from Raw was SmackDown's first selection. ECW's sole televised draft pick was Vladimir Kozlov from SmackDown. Additionally, SmackDown's WWE Champion Triple H was drafted by Raw, resulting in SmackDown's loss of its prime championship. At the end of <b>the</b> <b>televised</b> portion, the final draft choices were Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio of Raw by SmackDown, replacing the loss of the U.S. Champion, and SmackDown's Divas Champion Maryse by Raw, replacing the loss of the Women's Champion.|$|E
5|$|Via {{its website}} on February 11, WWE {{announced}} that the 2009 Draft was to take place on April 13 at Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. All wrestlers, general managers, and commentators were eligible to be drafted. A supplemental draft was announced for April 15. It was announced {{on the day of}} <b>the</b> <b>televised</b> draft that for the third consecutive year, matches would determine which brand received a draft pick, and that 12 superstars were to switch brands. As in previous drafts, the purpose of the 2009 WWE draft was to increase television ratings of WWE programming and to refresh the roster with new storylines for each brand.|$|E
5|$|Our Friends in the North was {{originally}} {{written by the}} playwright Peter Flannery for the theatre, {{while he was a}} writer in residence for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). The idea came to Flannery while he was watching the rehearsals for the company's production of Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2 at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1980; the scale of the plays inspired him to come up with his own historical epic. The original three-hour long theatre version of Our Friends in the North, directed by John Caird and featuring Jim Broadbent and Roger Allam among the cast, was produced by the RSC in 1982. It initially ran for a week at The Other Place in Stratford before touring to the city in which it was set, Newcastle upon Tyne, and then playing at The Pit, a studio theatre in the Barbican Centre in London. In its original form, the story went up only to the 1979 general election and the coming to power of the new Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. The play also contained a significant number of scenes set in Rhodesia, chronicling UDI, the oil embargo and the emergence of armed resistance to white supremacy. This plot strand was dropped from <b>the</b> <b>televised</b> version, although the title Our Friends in the North, a reference to how staff at BP in South Africa referred to the Rhodesian government of Ian Smith, remained.|$|E

5|$|When {{the boys}} regain consciousness, they are {{backstage}} at <b>the</b> <b>Televised</b> Jonas Brothers' 3D concert spectacular at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Mickey interrogates them and eventually threatens {{them with a}} chainsaw, refusing to believe they are not working for another company. As Mickey once again rants about his true intentions, this time insulting the Jonas Brothers' fans and Christians, Kyle stealthily turns {{on one of the}} microphones and Cartman raises the curtain, broadcasting Mickey's rant to both the concert-goers and the national television audience. When Mickey realizes that the curtains are raised, the crowd turns on Mickey and the Jonas Brothers leave the stage in a huff. An enraged Mickey grows to an enormous size and begins blowing fire and destroying most of Denver. Tammy and Kenny remove their purity rings, and Tammy suggests they go to T.G.I. Friday's, much to Kenny's excitement. The show immediately cuts to Kenny's funeral, where the audience learns that he contracted syphilis after receiving a blowjob from his girlfriend Tammy Warner and died as a result.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>televised</b> draft, Joey Styles, the Director of Digital Media Content for WWE's {{official}} website, {{interviewed the}} draftees on their reactions. The drafted wrestlers generally expressed {{approval of the}} draft and described what they hoped their experiences would be with their new brand. Seven of the wrestlers were champions with their original brand, and as outlined in the draft regulations, they carried their titles over to their new brand; this affected seven of nine championships. Champion draft selections included: Unified Tag Team Champions The Col√≥ns (Carlito and Primo), United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter, WWE Champion Triple H, and Divas Champion Maryse from SmackDown to Raw; Women's Champion Melina and Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio from Raw to SmackDown. Since Triple H was drafted to Raw, it left SmackDown without a top contested title, as Raw now featured {{two of the three}} top contested championships in WWE: the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships (although Edge would later brought the World Heavyweight Championship title back to SmackDown as its exclusive-top title following his win against John Cena at Backlash). When Mysterio and Porter switched brands, the two secondary championships switched brands {{for the first time in}} WWE's history. This also occurred when Melina and Maryse switched brands, as the two female contested titles also switched brands for the first time. Though the Unified Tag Team Champions were both drafted over to Raw from SmackDown, the titles were able to be defended on all three brands due to being unified.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1956 season, the Giants, who had {{previously}} been renting the Polo Grounds from baseball's Giants {{at a rate of}} $75,000 a year, began playing their home games at Yankee Stadium. The Giants run of championship game appearances in their late 1950s and early 1960s combined with their large market location translated into financial success. In 1958 they set a new home attendance record when 71,163 fans attended their November 8 game against Baltimore. And in 1959 they established their next four highest home game totals by drawing between 66,000 and 68,000 fans for games versus the Eagles, Packers, Browns, and Steelers. By the early 1960s, the Giants were receiving $175,000 a game under the NFL's television contract with CBS‚Äîfour times as much as small-market Green Bay, {{which was one of the}} most successful teams of the era. However, in the league's new contract, the Maras convinced the other owners that it would be in the best interest of the NFL to share television revenue equally, a practice which is still current, and is credited with strengthening the NFL. The Giants and professional football as a whole, were helped financially by their contest versus the Baltimore Colts in the 1958 NFL Championship game. <b>The</b> <b>televised</b> game became the first professional football game to go into overtime, and is credited with increasing the popularity of the NFL in the US. The explosion in interest in pro football was evidenced in the Giants financials: in 1956 they had less than 8,000 season ticket holders and by 1963 that number had increased to over 50,000. They sold out every home game in 1962 and 1963. Additionally, while scalpers hardly existed in 1956, by 1963 they regularly received $25 for a $5 ticket.|$|E
