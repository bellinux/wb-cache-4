5|$|On September 19, 1861, Morehead, Louisville Courier editor Reuben T. Durrett, and a {{man named}} Martin W. Barr were arrested for disloyalty. The three were taken to Indianapolis, Indiana, and the next day, Louisville circuit court judge John Catron issued a writ of habeas corpus for Morehead. On September 24, the officer who had arrested Morehead told Catron <b>that</b> <b>Secretary</b> of War Simon Cameron had already ordered Morehead taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor. Shortly after this, a grand jury was convened but failed to return any charges against Morehead.|$|E
5|$|The CIA put {{the plan}} into motion in late 1952. A {{freighter}} {{that had been}} borrowed from the UFC was specially refitted in New Orleans and loaded with weapons {{under the guise of}} agricultural machinery, and set sail for Nicaragua. However, the plan was terminated soon after: accounts of its termination vary. Some sources state that the State Department discovered the plan when a senior official was asked to sign a certain document, while others suggest that Somoza was indiscreet. The eventual outcome was <b>that</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State Dean Acheson called off the operation. The CIA continued to support Castillo Armas; it paid him a monthly retainer of 3000 U.S. dollars, and gave him the resources to maintain his rebel force.|$|E

25|$|After the war, he {{returned}} to Washington D.C. {{for a series of}} staff assignments and promotion to rear admiral.

25|$|On 26 July 1971, MR 3's Groupement Mobile 31 (GM 31) stood {{down from}} a planned heliborne {{insertion}} into Salavan in Military Region 4. It seems <b>that</b> <b>Secretary</b> of Defense Melvin Laird had sent an order down through the Department of Defense to ground the U.S. helicopters. After vigorous protests from the CIA concerning the humiliation of failing to fulfill the King's and the Prime Minister's wishes, the helilift was re-approved.

25|$|Fall was {{appointed}} to the position of Secretary of the Interior by President Warren G. Harding in March 1921. Soon after his appointment, Harding convinced Edwin Denby, the Secretary of the Navy, that Fall's department should take over responsibility for the Naval Reserves at Elk Hills, California, Buena Vista, California, and Teapot Dome, Wyoming. This last setting became the namesake of the scandal to erupt in April 1922 when the Wall Street Journal reported <b>that</b> <b>Secretary</b> Fall had decided that two of his friends, oilmen Harry F. Sinclair (Mammoth Oil Corporation) and Edward L. Doheny (Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company), should be given leases to drill in parts of these Naval Reserves without open bidding.|$|E
25|$|In January 1913, the Corps of Engineers {{reported}} that enough funds were {{left over from}} salvage of the Maine to permit construction of the Arlington National Cemetery Memorial. The following month, shortly before the commemoration ceremonies at the Maine Memorial at Arlington, President Taft announced his preference {{for the establishment of}} the memorial in the field of the Maine dead rather than another location in the cemetery. Secretary of War Lindley Miller Garrison then placed the design project on hold to allow the CFA to consider placement of the memorial in relation to three other projects also approved for construction: The Arlington Memorial Bridge (which included a new drive to a new ceremonial gateway to the cemetery), Arlington Memorial Amphitheater, and a receiving vault and chapel. After discussions about the proposed location for the memorial, Wyeth submitted three designs to the CFA. In executive session, the commission made a recommendation to the Secretary of War. Acting Quartermaster General Henry Granville Sharpe recommended <b>that</b> <b>Secretary</b> of War Garrison accept Wyeth's design, and he did by June 30, 1913.|$|E
25|$|Press {{accounts}} in January 2016 indicated that Department of Defense staff were reviewing Department of Justice {{documents from the}} Petraeus prosecution and considering whether to recommend to the Secretary of Defense that Petraeus be demoted on the Army's retired list. Laws and regulations indicate {{that members of the}} military are retired at the last rank in which they are deemed to have served successfully; Petraeus' admission of an extramarital affair and guilty plea with regard to removing and retaining classified information while serving in the grade of General could be grounds for reduction in rank to Lieutenant General. The matter was reviewed by then-Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh before he left office in October 2015; he recommended no further action. On January 29, press {{accounts in}}dicated that Stephen C. Hedger, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, had written to the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee. In his letter, Hedger informed the committee <b>that</b> <b>Secretary</b> of Defense Ashton Carter had concurred with the Army's recommendation, and would not impose any further punishment on Petraeus.|$|E
50|$|On December 7, 1962, Zemel instituted {{this suit}} against the Secretary of State and the Attorney General in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, seeking a {{judgment}} declaring (1) that he was entitled under the Constitution and laws of the United States to travel to Cuba and to have his passport validated for that purpose; (2) that his travel to Cuba {{and the use of}} his passport for that purpose would not violate any statute, regulation, or passport restriction; (3) <b>that</b> the <b>Secretary's</b> restrictions upon travel to Cuba were invalid; (4) that the Passport Act of 1926 and § 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 were unconstitutional; (5) <b>that</b> the <b>Secretary's</b> refusal to grant him a passport valid for Cuba violated rights guaranteed him by the Constitution and the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, and (6) that denial of the passport endorsement without a formal hearing violated his rights under the Fifth Amendment. (This procedural claim was abandoned in the District Court and not raised on appeal.) The complaint also requested <b>that</b> the <b>Secretary</b> be directed to validate appellant's passport for travel to Cuba, and <b>that</b> the <b>Secretary</b> and the Attorney General be enjoined from interfering with such travel. In his amended complaint, Zemel added to his constitutional attack on the 1926 and 1952 Acts a prayer <b>that</b> the <b>Secretary</b> and the Attorney General be enjoined from enforcing them.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that gender {{segregation}} within the labour market leads to women being overrepresented in a narrow range of jobs that offer limited promotion prospects. Presents the results of a questionnaire and interview study of women working in one such occupation, secretarial work, in England, France and Germany, and in the sectors of management consultancy and publishing. The results confirmed <b>that</b> <b>secretaries</b> in all three countries experience poor and unsystematic promotion prospects, despite the fact <b>that</b> many <b>secretaries</b> aspire to leave secretarial work. Sectoral differences are not as great as had been anticipated, and barriers to promotion were found to be especially acute in France and Germany. Promotion within secretarial work itself is shown to lack real value, and the implications of this for organizations are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Beginning in 1958, the Canadian {{government}} began to orchestrate Dominion Day celebrations. That year, then Prime Minister John Diefenbaker requested <b>that</b> <b>Secretary</b> of State Ellen Fairclough put together appropriate events, {{with a budget}} of $14,000. Parliament was traditionally in session on July 1, but Fairclough persuaded Diefenbaker {{and the rest of}} the federal Cabinet to attend. Official celebrations thereafter consisted usually of Trooping the Colour ceremonies on Parliament Hill in the afternoon and evening, followed by a mass band concert and fireworks display. Fairclough, who became Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, later expanded the bills to include performing folk and ethnic groups. The day also became more casual and family oriented. Canada's centennial in 1967 is often seen as an important milestone in the history of Canadian nationalism and in Canada's maturing as a distinct, independent country, after which Dominion Day became more popular with average Canadians. Into the late 1960s, nationally televised, multi-cultural concerts held in Ottawa were added and the fête became known as Festival Canada. After 1980, the Canadian {{government began}} to promote celebrating Dominion Day beyond the national capital, giving grants and aid to cities across the country to help fund local activities.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in 1905, {{successive}} presidential administrations {{had attempted}} to bring modern, beautiful designs to United States coins. [...] Following the redesign of the double eagle, eagle, half eagle and quarter eagle in 1907 and 1908, {{as well as the}} cent and nickel redesigns of 1909 and 1913 respectively, advocates of replacing the Barber coins began to push for the change when the coins' minimum term expired in 1916. [...] As early as 1914, Victor David Brenner, designer of the Lincoln cent, submitted unsolicited designs for the silver coins. [...] He was told in response <b>that</b> <b>Secretary</b> of the Treasury William G. McAdoo was completely occupied with other matters.|$|E

[...] Another deadlock, but council members Gildersleeve and Elliot took it on themselves to write the president's wife, Eleanor Roosevelt. They explained their objections to the WAAC legislation and reasons for it. Eleanor showed Elliot's letter to her husband, the president, and she sent Gildersleeves's letter on to the Undersecretary of the Navy, James V. Forrestal, a former naval aviator. Within days Forrestal replied, saying <b>that</b> <b>Secretary</b> Knox had asked the president to reconsider.|$|E
