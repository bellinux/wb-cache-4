The necessity of collecting substantial revenues to the State budget, which provide vital economic growth of the Romanian State, loses the substance when {{we are talking about}} taxes levied in relation to taxpayer. The environmental stamp, otherwise a controversial tax, represent for the State another way to earn revenue in advance, “as a loan", because in the end it's forced to repay <b>the</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>concerned</b> taxpayers, under <b>the</b> effect of a final and irrevocable court decision.

An equitable solution in solving these distortions would be the inclusion of the environmental stamp within the tax on means of transport, tax that is paid annually by vehicle owners. At the moment the level of the environmental stamp is calculated depending on the CO 2 emissions, exhaust emissions and the age of the vehicle. Tax on means of transport is calculated based on engine capacity, an amount determined by CO 2 emissions multiplying with each group of 200 cc or fraction on it. Therefore the unification of the two taxes would create a balance for all categories of vehicles...|$|R

His findings seem to “support the hypothesis that with increased proficiency, learners’ use of private speech diminishes” (p. 131). However, McCafferty concludes that “a number of other factors have been shown to influence private speech production” (p. 133).

An example of a crosscutting concern is a functional requirement whose implementation is distributed across multiple software modules. We asked the question, “How much does <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> that a <b>concern</b> is crosscutting affect the number of defects in a program? ” We conducted three extensive case studies to help answer this question. All three studies revealed a moderate to strong statistically significant correlation between the degree of scattering {{and the number of}} defects. This paper describes the experimental framework we developed to conduct the studies, the metrics we adopted and developed to measure the degree of scattering, the studies we performed, the efforts we undertook to remove experimental and other biases, and the results we obtained. In the process, we have formulated a theory that explains why increased scattering might lead to increased defects.

This descriptive study examines {{the structure and}} content of the bad news cancer consultations of 117 outpatients newly referred to the Medical Oncology Department of a large London teaching hospital. From previous communication research three main hypotheses are formed: (i) the cancer consultation is clinician-dominated rather than patient-centred; (ii) the level of psychosocial discussion between clinicians and patients is low and (iii) patient characteristics such as sex, age and prognostic category influence clinician behaviours. Each patient had two consultations with one of 5 oncologists. Both these were audiotaped with the patients' consent. The tapes were content coded using the Roter Interaction Analysis System. Results showed that clinicians tended to use closed rather than open questions. Patients asked few questions and were seldom given space to initiate discussion. Thus, the level of patient-centredness was low. Despite the fact that consultations concerned life threatening disease and often contained information regarding toxic treatment which is known to provoke psychological dysfunction, the number of questions relating to patients' psychological health were few. <b>The</b> <b>amount</b> of discussion <b>concerning</b> medical topics from both parties was 2. 5 times greater than <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> of psychosocial discussion.
