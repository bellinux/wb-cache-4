25|$|After {{four hundred}} years of colonial {{domination}} under the Spanish Empire, Puerto Rico finally received its sovereignty in 1898 through a Carta de Autonomía (Charter of Autonomy). This Charter of Autonomy was signed by Spanish Prime Minister Práxedes Mateo Sagasta and ratified by the Spanish Cortes. Despite <b>this,</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few months later, the United States claimed ownership of the island {{as part of the}} Treaty of Paris which concluded the Spanish–American War.|$|E
2500|$|For {{many who}} opposed ritualism, the key concern was to defend {{what they saw}} as the {{fundamentally}} Protestant identity of the Church of England. Nor was <b>this</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> matter of an ecclesiological argument: for many, {{there was a sense that}} Catholic worship is somehow [...] "un-English". Catholicism was deeply associated in many minds with cultural identities which, historically, many English people had commonly treated with suspicion, especially the Spanish, the French, and the Irish.|$|E

Their position was that, as a matter of international law, the Treaty of Paris could not empower the Spanish to [...] "give" [...] to the United States what was no longer theirs.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006 Blears {{joined in}} {{protests against the}} closure of {{hospital}} departments in her constituency, even though these closures {{were consistent with the}} policies of the government of which she was a senior member. Health Emergency's head of campaigns Geoff Martin said, [...] "there are 29 hospitals up and down the country facing the immediate threat of cuts and closure to key services in 2007. Will Hazel Blears be joining demonstrators on the streets in each of those areas or is <b>this</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> classic case of 'not in my back yard'"? ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{considering}} information {{like this}} as a point for or against, the reader must keep in mind questions such as: was this official privy to information about the U.S. government? Did he have communications with high-level administration figures such as President Roosevelt or Ambassador Joseph Grew? Is <b>this</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> strongly held personal opinion? Or were there measures justifying this view? If Britain, did, indeed know and chose to conceal, [...] "withholding this vital intelligence only ran {{the risk of losing}} American trust", and with it any further American aid, which would be reduced after the attack in any event.|$|E
2500|$|For a few rounds, Hall {{was showing}} his skill was paramount. [...] He scored first blood, {{which was an}} {{important}} occasion in bare-fist boxing; there were bets made on who would draw first blood. [...] But as the rounds went on, Donnelly's strength began to tell. [...] Hall would slip down onto his knee, without being in any danger. This was a tactic, because once he went down the round was over, he got a 30-second rest, and came back refreshed. [...] He was doing <b>this</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> bit too often for Donnelly's liking, and at one stage, Donnelly {{was just about to}} lash out when he was down, and his second shouted out an admonishment that Dan would lose the fight if he did so. [...] Eventually he did lose his temper, and as Hall slipped down yet again, Donnelly lashed out and hit him on the ear; the blood flowed. [...] That {{was the end of the}} round. [...] Hall refused to continue, saying he had been fouled, that Donnelly should be disqualified. [...] Donnelly fans voiced that no, Dan had definitely won, Hall didn't want to fight on, Donnelly was the champion. [...] The fight ended in some controversy, but to the Irish, he was the conquering hero.|$|E

60|$|Framley {{church was}} distant from <b>this</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> {{quarter of a}} mile, and stood {{immediately}} opposite to the chief entrance to Framley Court. It was but a mean, ugly building, having been erected about a hundred years since, when all churches then built were made to be mean and ugly; nor was it large enough for the congregation, {{some of whom were}} thus driven to the dissenting chapels, the Sions and Ebenezers, which had got themselves established {{on each side of the}} parish, in putting down which Lady Lufton thought that her pet parson was hardly as energetic as he might be. It was, therefore, a matter near to Lady Lufton's heart to see a new church built, and she was urgent in her eloquence both with her son and with the vicar, to have this good work commenced.|$|E
