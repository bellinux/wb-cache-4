500|$|Webber's orchestral accompaniment added a {{different}} level to the track, with its composition consisting of pizzicato strings, and its flowing tempo introducing Covington's opening vocals. The song jumps from being light to heavy and extravagant, with one section of it being hummed by choral voices. As the final lyrics goes, [...] "But all you have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me to know / That every word is true" [...] is sung, the London Philharmonic Orchestra comes into play with a huge climax and ends. According to the sheet music published by Music Sales Group, the song starts with a sequence of G/D–A7/D–D–Bm/D, changes to E–E/D–A/C–E7–A–D, with the chorus featuring a chord progression of A–Bm–Dmaj7–Gmaj7–G–Fm7. The song is composed in the key of C major with Covington's vocals spanning from the nodes of E3 to G5.|$|E

But so far they've not succeeded in catching him. And as for young things, you know how filled the world is with them for a man like him. Think it over, and just keep your heart-thoughts away from him. If you don't let your heart start to warm toward him, it will save your heart from a grievous chill later on." ...|$|E

5000|$|Two of {{the stars}} in the Big Dipper line up very closely with and point to Polaris. Polaris is a {{circumpolar}} star, and so it is always seen pretty close to the direction of true north. Hence, according to a popular myth, all slaves had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>look</b> for the Drinking Gourd and follow it to the North Star (Polaris) north to freedom. James Kelley has argued against the historicity of this interpretation in the Journal of Popular Culture.|$|R

5000|$|Critical {{opinion is}} divided, however, {{as to the}} virtues of the color version {{compared}} to the original black and white art.

[...] After the backlash, Storms took on a more conciliatory tone and openly apologized, stating {{that she is not}} a racist, and personally tried to make amends with Thomas Scott, who at the time was the only black member of the Commission.

5000|$|Jones {{appeared}} weakened {{after dropping}} {{a significant amount}} of weight in order to get back down to light heavyweight, but he nevertheless was able to pick up a disputed majority decision victory. Though Tarver landed more punches than Jones, Jones landed a higher percentage of his punches (Tarver landed 175 of his 506 thrown punches for a 35% success rate, while Jones landed 167 of his 406 thrown punches for a 41% success rate). When the fight ended, however, Tarver had done noticeable damage to Jones' face as his left eye was swelled almost completely shut and he was bleeding from the nose. The fight then went to the judge's scorecards. One judge had the bout even at 114-114, but the other two had Jones clearly ahead with scores of 117-111 and 116-112. The crowd, thinking Tarver had done enough to win the fight, loudly booed after Michael Buffer announced the decision and chanted [...] "bullshit" [...] as Jones remained in the ring for his post-fight interview with Larry Merchant. Tarver also felt that he had defeated Jones and told Merchant [...] "All you have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his face to know I won." ...|$|E
5000|$|It is in {{some ways}} {{difficult}} to gauge the difference in athletic performance. In racing sports, such as cross country and track & field, it is simple because all one has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the individual and team standings. In sports where only two teams play each other, it is more difficult. Massey Ratings does attempt to rank college teams across NCAA Divisions. As of November 19, 2013, NCAA Division III had 448 members, and the Massey Ratings had over 100 Division III men's basketball teams ranked among Division I teams. [...] Women's basketball had 88 Division III teams ranked among Division I teams. [...] Women's tennis had over 170 Division III teams ranked among Division I teams. [...] Women's soccer had over 300 Division III teams ranked among Division I teams. [...] Women's volleyball had over 300 Division III teams ranked among Division I teams. [...] These are the fall sports where only two teams play each other at a time, and where over 300 members of each Division field teams. In all of these rankings, the top teams were Division I teams. While these rankings are in constant states of flux as the seasons progress, they are typical of the substantial overlap between the Divisions, with the top teams being Division I teams.|$|E
