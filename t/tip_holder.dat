5000|$|A {{wide variety}} of power {{screwdrivers}} range from a simple 'stick'-type with batteries, a motor, and a <b>tip</b> <b>holder</b> all inline, to powerful [...] "pistol" [...] type VSR (variable-speed reversible) Cordless drills that also function as screwdrivers. This is particularly useful as drilling a pilot hole before driving a screw is a common operation. Special combination drill-driver bits and adapters let an operator rapidly alternate between the two. Variations include impact drivers, which provide two types of 'hammering' force for improved performance in certain situations, and [...] "right-angle" [...] drivers for use in tight spaces. Many options and enhancements, such as built-in bubble levels, high/low gear selection, magnetic screw holders, adjustable-torque clutches, keyless chucks, 'gyroscopic' control, etc., are available.|$|E
50|$|A draftsman's {{beam compass}} {{consists}} {{of a set of}} points and holders, mounted on a plated brass, aluminum, or electrum rod. One end is generally locked {{down at the end of}} the rod, while the other has both rough and fine adjustments, though some are opposite in construction. The locked <b>tip</b> <b>holder</b> {{consists of a}} needle, for the center of the radius, and the other holds either a lead clutch, or an inking nib. There are older variants which use a wooden beam. Another similar type is a Machinist or Engineers beam compass, which uses scribing points only, similar to ones used by woodworkers, except that its fine adjustment is generally more refined. These beam compasses can be extended by adding press-in rods, or by using a lockable rod connector.|$|E
40|$|A {{design for}} a {{manipulator}} system for manipulating bare scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) tips without any <b>tip</b> <b>holder</b> is presented. The extremely stiff and rigid system consists of an ultrahigh vacuum compatible fully three-dimensionally movable gripper module driven by stepping motors and piezomotors. The tips are clamped by hardened tool steel gripper jaws, which are controlled by a stepping motor through levers. The system allows the reproducible manipulation of bare tungsten tips made of wires with diameters of 0. 25 nm and having length of only up to 3 mm without damaging the tip or the STM. The tip manipulators' advantage is that the total mass of the scanning piezotube is reduced by removing the mass of a separate <b>tip</b> <b>holder.</b> Thereby, it becomes possible to further increase the resonance frequencies of the STM...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} perform charge {{transport}} measurements on freestanding as-grown GaAs nanowires, a room-temperature multi-tip {{scanning tunneling microscope}} was utilized as a nanoprober. Four-point resistance measurements along individual nanowires were performed with high spatial resolution. Subsequently, three different samples, grown with different temperature patterns, were investigated. Detailed resistance profiles along several nanowires on each sample were recorded. Three different regions were identified in the resistance profiles: A high resistance region at the nanowire bases (resulting from a suppressed dopant incorporation), a transition region in the middle with higher resistance and a low resistance region at the nanowire tops, with a desired amount of dopant incorporation. A calculation {{of the size of}} the depleted zone revealed that nanowires were completely depleted in the high resistance segments. Only in the low resistance region, the current could ow through the conduction channel in the nanowire core. In the high resistance region, the current was owing through surface states. In the transition region, the measured four-point IVs showed a non-linear characteristic. At high biases, the current could transfer from the surface to the better conducting core, while for low biases, the current had to ow via the surface. During the resistance profling, electron beam induced currents were present in the transition region as well as around the nanowire base on the substrate. A new customized low-temperature ultra-high vacuum four-tip scanning tunneling microscope capable of charge and magneto transport measurements has been realized to carry out charge transport measurements on semiconductor nanowires at liquid helium temperature. In order to navigate the four STM tips to desired positions, an SEM was used. SEM images of a test sample were used to optimize the vibration isolation of the experiment. A new nanopositioner (KoalaDrive) was developed to approach the tips to the sample. It could be shown that the KoalaDrive is capable of performing at low temperature (5 K), in ultra-high vacuum with high precision. In images taken with this STM, atomic steps on graphite as well as the 525 reconstruction of the Pt(100) surface could be resolved. The low-temperature multi-tip scanning tunneling microscope was used to contact single as-grown GaAs nanowires with one tip. Charging of a part of the <b>tip</b> <b>holders</b> prevented SEM images and conduction measurements with more tips...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increase}} of automatic operation of machine tools in factories, {{the development of the}} technology to detect cutting tool wears in process is strongly desired. There are many kinds of techniques for in-process detection. In this study, the vibration of a <b>tip</b> <b>holder</b> is used for the detective signal of tool wears. The material and the type of tools used in this experiment are cemented carbide M 20 and throw away type tips respectively. The work material is S 45 C. When the cutting speed ranged from 100 to 200 m/min at the depth of cut 3 mm and the feed 0. 18 mm/rev and the flank wear width reached from 0. 2 to 0. 3 mm, the natural vibrations of the <b>tip</b> <b>holder</b> were appeared in cutting forces. From these results, we think that this vibration can be utilized as a detective signal of cptting tool wear. However, in order to insure this utilization, many experiments under other various conditions may be necessary...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} replace and reuse only {{the tip of}} the probe in an atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) enables employing a greater variety of probes, enhancing their functionalities, and simplifying their use for imaging, metrology, and manipulation. This paper presents the development and evaluation of a system that employs a liquid meniscus {{at the end of an}} AFM probe as amicrogripper to pick up tips, hold them during use, and subsequently drop them off. The system also comprises a tip supply station and a <b>tip</b> <b>holder</b> that supply new tips and preserve used tips for potential future reuse. The designs of the tip supply station and the <b>tip</b> <b>holder</b> are discussed, and the stiffness of the liquid meniscus is analyzed. Subsequently, a prototype of the system is fabricated. It is demonstrated to pick up a new AFM tip and image a calibration grating without any artifacts. The image is shown to be identical to that obtained by a conventional AFM probe. Likewise, tip detachment and reuse are also experimentally demonstrated. The reused tip is shown to image a calibration grating without artifacts, thereby demonstrating that the detachment and pick-up process does not deteriorate the quality of the replaceable AFM tip...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{construction}} of a very compact scanning tunneling microscope (STM) which can be operated at temperatures between 4 and 350 K. The tip and a tiny <b>tip</b> <b>holder</b> are the only movable parts, whereas the sample and the piezoscanner are rigidly attached to the body of the STM. This leads to an excellent mechanical stability. The coarse approach system relies on the slip-stick principle and is operated by the same piezotube which is used for scanning. As an example of the performance of the device, images of a NbSe 2 surface with atomic resolution are obtained...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- The {{increasing}} computer {{power in}} modern manufacturing machines {{has given the}} possibility to integrate advanced computer based control systems. In this work a simulation model for active control of machine-tool vibration in turning operations is described. The model contains both the mechanical structure and the control system. The simulation is done with and without active control. The structure vibration is suppressed by simulating actuators. The simulation is done to get a first indication of the potentials of a proposed new tool holder design and to test the usability of such multidisciplinary simulations as a supporting tool for product development. The results show {{that it is possible}} to simulate the total system. The vibrations of the tool <b>holder</b> <b>tip</b> could be decreased significantly by using reasonable forces. The software used was found to be very user friendly and to be able to perform such coupled simulations in this way during product development must be considered to be a great advantage...|$|R
40|$|Spectral imaging, where {{complete}} x-ray spectra are {{acquired from}} 2 D or 3 D arrays of points, {{is a powerful}} microanalytical technique, especially when combined with multivariate statistical analysis [1]. Chemical imaging, typically spectroscopic imaging or mapping with energy-loss electrons or x rays has been performed on flat [2 - 3] or pillar-shaped specimens [4] in the TEM to achieve 3 D chemical images. In this paper we describe results from acquisition and analysis, via multivariate statistical analysis (MSA), of x-ray spectral images acquired from a needle-shaped FIB specimen, tilted from- 90 to + 90 in a newly available TEM specimen holder from Fischione Instruments [5], with full EDS coverage and constant thickness throughout the tomographic series. A needle-shaped specimen of aluminum oxide (~ 10 - 20 nm particles) dispersion-strengthened Ni (matrix) was prepared by FIB to a thickness of ~ 100 nm near the tip and ~ 200 nm near the base, and extracted in situ and placed upon a special cartridge designed originally for atom-probe tips. The cartridge was then placed in the Fischione Model 2050 On-Axis Tomography holder [5]. Figure 1 a shows the <b>tip</b> of the <b>holder</b> while Figure 1 b is an SEM image of the needle-shaped specimen. The specimen was imaged in a FEI Tecnai F- 30 ST operated at 300 kV in STEM mode (3 nm-diameter FWTM electron probe) with an EDAX SUTW Si (Li) EDS. Drift-corrected spectral images wer...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of electrolyte concentration in nanoliter quantities of fluid {{is a fundamental}} step in the utilization of micropuncture and isolated tubule microperfusion techniques for studying ion transport. A number of methodologies {{have been developed for}} these analyses, including helium glow photometry [1], electron probe microanalysis [2], and atomic absorption spectrophotometry [3]. Because of the significant cost of the equipment for performing atomic absorption spectrophotometry or electron probe microanalysis, and the lack of commercial availability of helium glow photometers, we decided to utilize ion-specific electrodes for the {{measurement of}} sodium and potassium in samples from isolated tubule microperfusion experiments. The application of ion-specific micro-electrodes to the measurement of intracellular ion activity and macroanalysis is well established [4], but the technique has not been widely applied to the analysis of electrolyte concentration in nanoliter droplets, although Garvin has recently developed a flow-through ion-selective electrode apparatus for measurement of potassium concentrations [5]. Since aqueous droplets must be analyzed under oil to prevent evaporation, one problem we had to overcome was the deterioration in the sensitivity of liquid ion exchanger microelectrodes on contact with oil. Other investigators have utilized ion-selective microelectrodes to study intracellular ion activities or ion activities in tubular fluid in situ, circumstances in which the tissue is bathed in an aqueous electrolyte solution rather than mineral oil [6 – 8]. In the case where measurements have been made in aqueous droplets under oil, an ion-selective glass rather than a liquid ion exchanger microelectrode was used [9]. With liquid ion exchangers, we found that the sensitivity of the electrode decreased markedly on contact with mineral oil, probably due to the lipophilicity of the ionophore. Although it is possible to utilize very small <b>tips</b> and <b>holders</b> with sidearms to express contaminated ionophore (S. Agulian, personal communication), we found this technique cumbersome and have adapted the methods described by Vogel et al [10], which utilizes a desilanization step to allow a droplet of aqueous solution to protect the ionophore from oil contamination. We have applied electrodes constructed using this technique to the measurement of electrolyte concentrations in aqueous nanoliter droplets under oil. The equipment for this analysis is relatively inexpensive, available in many microperfusion laboratories, and can be applied to a variety of ions, and therefore the technique may be valuable to a wide spectrum of investigators...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we focus}} on {{analyzing}} the tip displacement relation for a piezoelectric tube scanner used in scanning probe microscopes. In particular, the finite element model consists of a piezoelectric tube, a <b>tip</b> <b>holder,</b> and a tip {{in an effort to}} include the boundary effect on tube deflection. A large number of simulations are conducted for model validation and comparisons with results in the literature. Design formulas commonly suggested by piezotube manufacturers are also used to compare with our simulations. We show that the design formulas provide a good approximation of the tip displacement when tube's aspect ratio is well above 2. In addition, the axial displacement of the tip in tube bending, also known as the coupling term, is analyzed through simulations. A ratio of 4 exists between the axial displacement in tube elongation and that in tube bending caused by energizing single quadrant electrode. The result is shown to be convenient to use to decouple motion in the orthogonal directions. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
