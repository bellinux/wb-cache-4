Many of <b>the</b> <b>layoffs</b> in Detroit's auto industry, including Nitz's in 1979, had been due to the increasing market share of Japanese automakers, particularly due to Chrysler's increased sales of captively-imported Mitsubishi models rebadged and sold under the Dodge and now-defunct Plymouth brands, leading to allegations that Vincent Chin received racially charged comments attributing to <b>the</b> <b>layoffs</b> while being beaten.|$|E

25|$|On April 26, 2017, {{approximately}} 100 ESPN {{employees were}} notified that their positions with the sports network had been terminated, among them athletes-turned-analysts Trent Dilfer and Danny Kanell, and noted journalists like NFL beat reporter Ed Werder and Major League Baseball expert Jayson Stark. <b>The</b> <b>layoffs</b> came as ESPN continued to shed viewers, more than 10 million {{over a period}} of several years, while paying big money for the broadcast rights to such properties as the NFL, NBA and College Football Playoff. Further cost-cutting measures taken include moving the studio operations of ESPNU to Bristol from Charlotte, North Carolina, reducing its longtime MLB studio show Baseball Tonight to Sundays as a lead-in to the primetime game and adding the MLB Network-produced Intentional Talk to ESPN2's daily lineup.|$|E

The study also set out to investigate {{the nature of the relationship}} between the reason for <b>the</b> <b>layoff,</b> as provided by management, and stock price reaction.

To facilitate this, an event study methodology was used with an estimation period of 120 days and a 21 -day event window. The findings of the study reveal that there exists no statistically significant relationship between layoff announcements and stock price reaction. However, the reason guiding <b>the</b> <b>layoff</b> decision has an impact on stock price movement. For layoffs that are proactive in nature, stock prices react positively but in cases where <b>the</b> <b>layoff</b> is reactive in nature, there is no impact on the stock price reaction...|$|R

In September 2014, Microsoft laid off 2,100 people, including 747 people in the Seattle-Redmond area, where the company is headquartered.

500|$|Bain Capital's {{leveraged}} buyouts sometimes led to layoffs, either {{soon after}} acquisition or later after {{the firm had}} concluded its role. Exactly how many jobs Bain Capital added compared to those lost because of these investments and buyouts is unknown, owing {{to a lack of}} records and Bain Capital's penchant for privacy on behalf of itself and its investors. Maximizing the value of acquired companies and the return to Bain's investors, not job creation, was the firm's primary investment goal. Bain Capital's acquisition of Ampad exemplified a deal where it profited handsomely from early payments and management fees, even though the subject company itself later went into bankruptcy. Dade Behring was another case where Bain Capital received an eightfold return on its investment, but the company itself was saddled with debt and laid off over a thousand employees before Bain Capital exited (the company subsequently went into bankruptcy, with more layoffs, before recovering and prospering).
