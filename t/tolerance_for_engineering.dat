The algorithm combines the anti-reverse engineering technique, chaotic system and the idea of Easter Egg software watermarks. The global protection for the program is provided by dispersing watermark over the whole code of the program with chaotic dispersion coding; the resistance against reverse engineering is improved by using the anti-reverse engineering technique. In the paper, we implement the scheme in the Intel i 386 architecture and the Windows operating system, and analyze the robustness and the performance degradation of watermarked program. Analysis indicates that the algorithm resists various types of semanticspreserving transformation attacks and is good <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> reverse <b>engineering</b> attacks. ...|$|R
40|$|Although {{recognized}} as a promising microbial cell factory for producing biofuels, current productivity in cyanobacterial systems is low. To make the processes economically feasible, one of the hurdles which needs to be overcome is the low tolerance of hosts to toxic biofuels. Meanwhile, little information is available regarding the cellular responses to biofuels stress in cyanobacteria, which makes it challenging <b>for</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>engineering.</b> Using large proteomic datasets of Synechocystis under various biofuels stress and environmental perturbation, a protein co-expression network was first constructed and then combined with the experimentally determined protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Proteins with statistically higher topological overlap in the integrated network were identified as common responsive proteins to both biofuels stress and environmental perturbations. In addition, a WGCNA network analysis was performed to distinguish unique responses to biofuels from those to environmental perturbations and to uncover metabolic modules and proteins uniquely associated with biofuels stress. The results showed that biofuel-specific proteins and modules were enriched in several functional categories, including photosynthesis, carbon fixation and amino acid metabolism, which may represent potential key signatures for biofuels stress responses in Synechocystis. Network-based analysis allowed determination of the responses specifically related to biofuels stress, and the results constituted an important knowledge foundation <b>for</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>engineering</b> against biofuels in Synechocystis...|$|R
40|$|As a {{first step}} in {{developing}} a synthesis technique for assisting designers to specify tolerances in product design, a new 3 D statistical tolerance analysis approach is proposed A simple two-hale and two-pin (THTP) assembly is used as an example. On the basis of the introduction of an R-vector to represent position tolerance and a feasible assembly test formula, the probability of successful THTP assemblies to engineering specifications is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. important issues in the implementation of the approach are explored. A comparison of the analysis results far the worst case, and this statistical approach, as well as the trade-off analysis between quality loss and manufacturing cost, demonstrates the advantages of the statistical tolerance design technique. The approach and results presented in this paper can be either applied directly to the THTP tolerance synthesis or used as a reference <b>for</b> statistical <b>tolerance</b> design <b>for</b> other <b>engineering</b> applications...|$|R
40|$|Abiotic {{stresses}} including drought {{are serious}} {{threats to the}} sustainability of crop yields accounting for more crop productivity losses than any other factor in rainfed agriculture. Success in breeding for better adapted varieties to abiotic stresses depend upon the concerted efforts by various research domains including plant and cell physiology, molecular biology, genetics, and breeding. Use of modern molecular biology tools for elucidating the control mechanisms of abiotic stress <b>tolerance,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>engineering</b> stress tolerant crops {{is based on the}} expression of specific stress-related genes. Hence, genetic <b>engineering</b> <b>for</b> developing stress tolerant plants, based on the introgression of genes that are known to be involved in stress response and putative tolerance, might prove to be a faster track towards improving crop varieties. Far beyond the initial attempts to insert "single-action" genes, engineering of the regulatory machinery involving transcription factors has emerged as a new tool now for controlling the expression of many stress-responsive genes. Nevertheless, the task of generating transgenic cultivars is not only limited to the success in the transformation process, but also proper incorporation of the stress tolerance. Evaluation of the transgenic plants under stress conditions, and understanding the physiological effect of the inserted genes at the whole plant level remain as major challenges to overcome. This review focuses on the recent progress in using transgenic technology for the improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in plants. This includes discussion on the evaluation of abiotic stress response and the protocols for testing the transgenic plants <b>for</b> their <b>tolerance</b> under close-to-field conditions...|$|R
40|$|A major {{challenge}} when using microorganisms to produce bulk chemicals such as biofuels {{is that the}} production targets are often toxic to cells. Many biofuels are known to reduce cell viability through damage to the cell membrane and interference with essential physiological processes. Therefore, cells must trade off biofuel production and survival, reducing potential yields. Recently, {{there have been several}} efforts towards <b>engineering</b> strains <b>for</b> biofuel <b>tolerance.</b> Promising methods include engineering biofuel export systems, heat shock proteins, membrane modifications, more general stress responses, and approaches that integrate multiple tolerance strategies. In addition, in situ recovery methods and media supplements can help to ease the burden of end-product toxicity and may be used in combination with genetic approaches. Recent advances in systems and synthetic biology provide a framework <b>for</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>engineering.</b> This review highlights recent targeted approaches towards improving microbial tolerance to next-generation biofuels with a particular emphasis on strategies that will improve production...|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{and provides}} validity {{evidence for the}} new individual difference construct of <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> contradiction, defined {{as a mode of}} thinking that accepts and even thrives on apparent bivalent logical contradictions. In Study 1, which used a sample of 198 undergraduates, convergent and discriminant validity evidence <b>for</b> <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> contradiction were obtained via associations with a set of established variables. In Study 2, further validity evidence was obtained and the relevance of <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> contradiction in the workplace was demonstrated using a sample of 142 prison officers. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>for</b> contradiction was found to interact with situational judgment ability to affect job performance in the manner as hypothesized.

40|$|The {{practice}} of medicine has always been characterized by uncertainty. Yet, attempts to study <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> uncertainty in medicine have been few, and limited to its influence on specialty preferences and test-ordering behavior. In particular, studies have not investigated how the process of socialization into the medical profession affects <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> uncertainty. Based {{on the assumption that}} uncertainty and ambiguity are related concepts, a modified version of a <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> ambiguity scale was used to study Johns Hopkins medical students' (N = 386) <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> ambiguity (TFA) through 4 yr of medical school. In addition, using alcoholism {{as an example of a}} clinically ambiguous condition, the association between students' <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> ambiguity and their perceived role in diagnosing and treating alcoholism was also investigated. Results indicate that <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> ambiguity (1) does not change throughout medical school, (2) is lower among men, whites and students who are younger when they begin medical school, (3) is higher among prospective psychiatrists than surgeons, and (4) is lower among students who do not feel responsible for diagnosing and treating alcoholism. These findings suggest that <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> ambiguity may, indeed, affect practitioners' career choices and performance and that selection of medical students may be more important than medical training per se in influencing students' <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> ambiguity. If medical schools admitted students who possess a high <b>tolerance</b> <b>for</b> ambiguity, quality of care for ambiguous conditions might improve, imbalances in physician supply and practice patterns might be reduced, and the increasing ambiguity in medical practice might be better acknowledged and accepted. uncertainty professional socialization medical education medical students' attitudes alcoholism specialty choice...|$|R
