5|$|Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri is a 1996 {{tactical}} first-person shooter {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Looking Glass Technologies. Set in a science-fictional depiction of the 24th century, the game follows a faction of humans who colonize the Alpha Centauri star system to escape from <b>the</b> <b>Hegemony,</b> a totalitarian Earth government. The player assumes the role of Nikola ap Io, the leader of an Alpha Centauri military unit, and undertakes missions against pirates and <b>the</b> <b>Hegemony.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 877 the Vikings divided Mercia, {{taking the}} eastern part for {{themselves}} and leaving Ceolwulf with the west. The Vikings went on to attack Wessex, leaving Ceolwulf free to renew Mercian claims of hegemony in Wales. At almost {{the same time as}} Alfred's victory over the Vikings in 878 at the Battle of Edington, Ceolwulf defeated and killed Rhodri Mawr, king of the north Welsh territory of Gwynedd. After Ceolwulf's disappearance in 879, Mercia began to fall under <b>the</b> <b>hegemony</b> of Wessex.|$|E
5|$|It soon {{becomes clear}} that MacPherson is being poisoned. Nikola {{believes}} that Brandt is responsible, because of his recent disappearances, but is proven wrong. After MacPherson dies, Sarah Walker takes his place as commander of Strike Force Centauri. Walker sends Nikola, disguised as a pirate, on an espionage mission to discover the traitor's identity. Nikola finds information that incriminates Ashford, who, when confronted, boasts of his actions and leaps to his death from a docking bay. The squad continues the war, and <b>the</b> <b>Hegemony</b> is eventually forced to gather its remaining forces at a base on Thatcher. The squad destroys the facility by detonating a highly explosive fuel tank inside it. Following its defeat, <b>the</b> <b>Hegemony</b> denies involvement in the war, declares Pentheus a rogue agent and appoints a new ambassador to the system. While angered by the announcement, Strike Force Centauri celebrates its victory as the game ends.|$|E

5|$|Egbert's conquests {{brought him}} wealth {{far greater than}} his {{predecessors}} had enjoyed, and enabled him to purchase the support which secured the West Saxon throne for his descendants. The stability brought by the dynastic succession of Egbert and Æthelwulf led to an expansion of commercial and agrarian resources, and to an expansion of royal income. The wealth of the West Saxon kings was also increased by the agreement in 838–39 with Archbishop Ceolnoth for the previously independent West Saxon minsters to accept the king as their secular lord in return for his protection. However, there was no certainty that <b>the</b> <b>hegemony</b> of Wessex would prove more permanent than that of Mercia.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny was {{determined}} to stop <b>the</b> <b>hegemony</b> of Senegal in West Africa and a political confrontation ensued between Ivorian and Senegalese leaders. Houphouët-Boigny refused {{to participate in the}} Inter-African conference in Dakar on 31 December 1958, which was intended to lay the foundation for the Federation of Francophone African States. Although that federation was never realised, Senegal and Mali (known at the time as French Sudan) formed their own political union, the Mali Federation. After de Gaulle allowed the Mali Federation independence in 1959, Houphouët-Boigny tried to sabotage the federation's efforts to wield political control; in cooperation with France, he managed to convince Upper Volta, Dahomey, and Niger to withdraw from the Mali Federation, before it collapsed in August 1960.|$|E
5|$|In 1499 the Duchy of Milan was conquered by the French, {{causing a}} {{diaspora}} of {{artists from the}} city to all of northern Italy and beyond. Perhaps {{this is the reason}} for the return of Tamagnino to Brescia. A tantalising project was the commission of the Palazzo della Loggia, in which he participated between November 1499 and June 1500. Sculptural works that had begun at the Loggia in 1492, when Tamagnino had left Brescia, were now <b>the</b> <b>hegemony</b> of Gasparo Cairano, for some years considered as a court sculptor by the Brescian grandees, both public and private.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>hegemony</b> of Yamhad {{affected}} Qatna's economy; {{the trade}} route connecting Mesopotamia and Mari to Qatna through Palmyra lost its importance, while the trade routes from the Mediterranean to Mesopotamia {{came under the}} full control of Aleppo, contributing to Qatna's loss of wealth. Following the destruction of Mari by Hammurabi of Babylon around 1761 BC, information about Qatna becomes scarce; in the late 17th century BC, Yamhad invaded and defeated Qatna {{during the reign of}} Yarim-Lim III. The political and commercial importance of Qatna declined quickly during the Late Bronze Age (LB I), around 1600 BC, as a result of growing Egyptian and Mitannian influences. Numerous small states appeared in the region and detached from Qatna.|$|E

25|$|By 1928–1929 a {{coalition}} of a new Palestinian nationalist group began to challenge <b>the</b> <b>hegemony</b> so far exercised by al-Husseini.

From this period on, a rift emerged, that was to develop into a feud between the directive elite of Palestinian Arabs.|$|E

25|$|Following this period, {{the region}} of Mesopotamia seems to have come under the sway of a Sumerian conqueror from Adab, Lugal-Ane-mundu, ruling over Uruk, Ur, and Lagash. According to inscriptions, he ruled from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean, {{and up to the}} Zagros Mountains, {{including}} Elam. However, his empire fell apart with his death; the king-list indicates that Mari in Upper Mesopotamia was the next city to hold <b>the</b> <b>hegemony.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the Greek cities by Philip and Alexander also taught the Greeks that their city-states could never again be powers in their own right, and that <b>the</b> <b>hegemony</b> of Macedon and its {{successor}} states could not be challenged unless the city states united, or at least federated. The Greeks valued their local independence too much to consider actual unification, but they made several attempts to form federations through which they could hope to reassert their independence.|$|E
25|$|As <b>the</b> <b>hegemony</b> of the Caliphate crumbled, Sarir {{found itself}} {{continually}} {{at war with}} its successor states, such as Derbent and Shirvan. In these wars it was generally victorious and allowed Sarir to manipulate the politics of Derbent. Concomitantly, the kings of Sarir shifted away from the Khazar alliance and mounted several incursions into the Khazarian steppes. The pattern of intermarriage between the royal houses of Sarir and Alania cemented the anti-Khazar alliance of the two Christian states.|$|E

Unlike Xenophon, who still believed in <b>the</b> dual <b>hegemony</b> and in <b>the</b> division of spheres of influence between Sparta and Athens, Diodorus reflects a perspective which is not Athenian and which reopens the debate on the conditions for the exercise of Panhellenic hegemony.
