The SRAM was also capable of performing one [...] "major maneuver" [...] during its flight which gave the missile the capability of reversing its course and attacking targets that were behind it, sometimes called an [...] "over-the-shoulder" [...] launch. The missile had a Circular Error Probable (CEP) of about 1400 ft and a maximum range of 110 nmi km. The SRAM used a single W69 nuclear warhead with a variable yield of 17 kilotons as a fission weapon, or 210 kilotons as a fusion weapon with tritium boost enabled.

5000|$|The Israeli {{government}} {{considered the}} import of color televisions as a frivolous luxury that would increase social gaps. Therefore, the government ordered IBA and IETV to erase the colour from colour-taped telecasts by erasing the [...] "burst phase" [...] signal. The [...] "damaged" [...] signal triggered the [...] "colour killer" [...] mechanism, installed in colour TV sets to prevent the appearance of incidental colour spots on the screen when black-and-white films are broadcast or when the reception is disturbed. This method was named mekhikon (מחיקון [...] "eraser"), and soon after its introduction, special TV sets with an anti-mekhikon (אנטי-מחיקון [...] "anti-eraser") device were offered. This device reinstalled the burst phase signal according to several known standards. The client had to <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> until {{the pictures on the}} screen appeared in natural colours. According to a report in Yediot Aharonoth from January 1979 clients had to manipulate the switch every 15 minutes on average in normal conditions, or up to 10 times an hour when special problems occurred, in order to restore natural colours or if the picture suddenly turned black and white.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{reference}} books, including Random House's American Slang, {{claim that}} the term comes from the German word glitschen ("to slip") and the Yiddish word gletshn ("to slide or skid"). Either way, it {{is a relatively new}} term. It was first widely defined for the American people by Bennett Cerf on the June 20, 1965 episode of What's My Line as [...] "a kink... when anything goes wrong down there Kennedy, they say there's been a slight glitch." [...] Astronaut John Glenn explained the term in his section of the book Into Orbit, writing thatAnother term we adopted to describe some of our problems was [...] "glitch." [...] Literally, a glitch is a spike or change in voltage in an electrical circuit which takes place when the circuit suddenly has a new load put on it. You have probably noticed a dimming of lights in your home when you <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> or start the dryer or the television set. Normally, these changes in voltage are protected by fuses. A glitch, however, is such a minute change in voltage that no fuse could protect against it.John Daly further defined the word on the July 4, 1965 episode of the same show, saying that it's a term used by the Air Force at Cape Kennedy, in the process of launching rockets, [...] "it means something's gone wrong and you can't figure out what it is so you call it a [...] "glitch". Later, on July 23, 1965, Time Magazine felt it necessary to define it in an article: [...] "Glitches—a spaceman's word for irritating disturbances." [...] In relation to the reference by Time Magazine, the term has been believed to enter common usage during the American Space Race of the 1950s, where it was used to describe minor faults in the rocket hardware that were difficult to pinpoint.|$|E

40|$|Compared with {{traditional}} semiconductor materials, graphene has unparalleled advantages on mobility, thermal conductivity, mechanical strength and so on. Thus {{it was considered}} as a promising candidate material for the future semiconductor industry. However, since its band structure is gapless, band gap engineering has become a significant task for scientists. My dissertation focuses on chemical and physical modification methods that could {{pave the way to}} applications of graphene based devices and reveal a number of interesting phenomena. The critical roadblock for graphene electronics is the absence of a band gap. We first focus on chemical functionalization of graphene as a route to band gap engineering. This is first achieved via grafting nitrophenyl groups onto single layer graphene sheets. The functionalized graphene samples behave like semiconductors. Substrate supported and suspended samples demonstrate transport gaps as large as ~ 0. 1 eV and ~ 1 eV, respectively. Secondly, we developed a different chemical functionalization approach based on organometallic chemistry. Apart from behaving like semiconductors, functionalized samples also retains the high mobility of the pristine state. The second part of the thesis focuses on physical modifications of graphene a. Suspended graphene-based switch was developed using a special pulsing breakdown technique. Voltage pulses of 2. 5 V~ 4 V and 8 V can <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> device to ON (high conductance) state and OFF (low conductance) state, respectively. We provide experimental evidence that these behaviors arise from motions of atomic-scale carbon chains and reformation of chemical bonds. Finally, strain engineering is another approach for modifying transport properties of graphene. We proposed and developed novel nano-electromechanical system (NEMS) -like devices that allows in situ modulation of strain on suspended graphene flakes, which in turn induces interesting changes in both transport and morphological properties of graphene. In summary, this dissertation presents our studies on chemical and physical modification approaches of graphene samples, and related novel phenomena that emerge amid these devices, with implications on next generation electronic devices...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} design of a touch screen and switch turning tool for the DORIS {{offshore}} monitoring robot. The DORIS project is a collaboration project between NMBU and UFRJ, financed by Statoil and Petrobras. The projects goal is to develop a rail guided offshore monitoring robot, which can replace humans in dangerous working conditions and supply better, more frequent and more accurate information on how a platform is operating. The project is currently in its third and last year, with a working prototype installed at the Petrobras testing facility as the final goal. If this is successful funding for a new three year period and the robot installed at an operational oil platform is the goal. Because of the harsh working conditions there are many requirements to the tool, these include the functions, build quality, compliancy and power. There are a number of different design options and methods available, and these are discussed and evaluated in order to find the best option. First of it is decided that the 6 th DoF needed to <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> will be incorporated in the tool. Further I have chosen to combine the touch screen and switch turning tool into one combined tool. Electric stepper motors are chosen as the power source, and spur, bevel and internal ring gears are chosen as the power transmission system. When all the design choices are made the final design is done and a prototype of the tool is made using a 3 D printer and some metalwork in the workshop. The tool is tested and proves to function well, but with some trouble involving the amount of torque produced compared to the theoretical number. Summarized the tool functions well, but at the moment it is too heavy for the DORIS manipulator arm which has a capacity of 250 g. This means that in order for the tool to be useful the arm has to be made stronger. M-I...|$|E

50|$|The 1960s live-action Batman TV series {{featured}} the Batcave extensively, and portrayed it {{as a large}} but well-lit cavern containing an atomic power generator, a chemistry lab, punch-card computers, and other electronic crime-fighting devices, almost always prominently labeled with their function. In this incarnation, it primarily served as a crime lab and garage for the Batmobile. Perhaps the most famous aspect of this Batcave {{is that it is}} accessed from Wayne Manor via two Bat-Poles (one marked BRUCE and the other marked DICK), which are hidden behind a bookcase that can be opened by <b>turning</b> <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> hidden inside <b>a</b> bust of Shakespeare. When Bruce and Dick slide down these Bat-Poles, they are instantly outfitted in their costumes before reaching the landing pads at the bottom.

The Batcave is also accessible via a service elevator which is used by Alfred.|$|R
5000|$|The {{data link}} layer {{addresses}} data packets based on the destination hardware’s physical Media Access Control (MAC) address. Switches within the network maintain Content Address Tables (CAMs) that maps the switch’s ports to specific MAC addresses. These tables allow the switch to securely deliver the packet to its intended physical address only. Using the switch to connect only the systems that are communicating provides much greater security than a network hub, which broadcasts all traffic over all ports, allowing an eavesdropper to intercept and monitor all network traffic. A CAM Table Exhaustion Attack basically <b>turns</b> <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> into <b>a</b> hub. [...] The attacker floods the CAM table with new MAC-to-port mappings until the table’s fixed memory allotment is full. At this point the switch no longer knows how to deliver traffic based on a MAC-to-port mapping, and defaults to broadcasting traffic over all ports. An adversary is then able to intercept and monitor all network traffic traversing the switch to include passwords, emails, instant messages, etc.|$|R

40|$|Knowing if {{and when}} a {{particular}} forwarding rule has been installed in <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> is essential for understanding network behavior. This knowledge is missing in current Software De-fined Networks, where the controller needs to ensure correct {{functioning of the network}} during forwarding state updates. Studies show that an absolute certainty about a rule’s pres-ence can be achieved only by exercising it in the data plane. In this work we describe ProboScope, a transparent layer at the controller that relies on carefully constructed data plane packets to provide reliable acknowledgments of rule instal-lations. Driven by the theoretical underpinnings of the way probing rules and packets are constructed, we devise tech-niques that can generate probe packets in a variety of sce-narios, in parallel with simultaneous rule installations, all while paying attention to the already installed rules. Our evaluation shows ProboScope’s effectiveness and low over-head. Moreover, it demonstrates two important findings: (i) ProboScope can <b>turn</b> <b>a</b> buggy <b>switch</b> into <b>a</b> corrected one, and perhaps surprisingly (ii) ProboScope can increase the performance of <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> that delays barrier responses in an effort to ensure correct behavior. 1...|$|R

This paper provides an economic policy {{assessment of the}} effects of medicine deregulation drawing on the Peruvian experience between 1991 and 2006. As in other low-income countries, health insurance development is inadequate, drug expenditure is mostly paid out-of-pocket and approximately one third of the Peruvian population has limited access to ‘essential medicines’. Market deregulation in this context can exert an impact on prices and hence reduce access to medicines. Based on this evidence, we find that product and price deregulation of the medicines market appears to have reduced consumer trust of locally produced medicines, which in <b>turn</b> incentivised <b>a</b> <b>switch</b> to branded and more expensive drugs.
