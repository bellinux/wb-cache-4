5|$|The Mahanoy Creek {{watershed}} is 66 percent forested land, 21 percent agricultural land, 9 percent barren mined land, and 4 percent developed land. However, <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of Mahanoy Creek is 50 percent forested land, 44 percent mined land, 5 percent developed land, {{and less}} than 1 percent agricultural land.

5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the main sequence {{in the region of}} class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars {{in this part of the}} instability strip that intersects <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} period some {{religious}} institutions displayed ancient Greek coins {{of the island}} of Rhodes as specimens of the Thirty Pieces of Silver. The obverses of these coins showed a facing head of the sun god Helios, with rays projecting around <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of it. These rays were interpreted as {{a representation of the}} Crown of Thorns.|$|E
50|$|The middle {{portion of}} the {{movement}} lasts 48 bars and is also symmetrical in structure, made up of two fugal sections and a central episode in which the non-thematic material in the ritornello is heard again. The new fugue subject is five bars long and is first heard in the violin with a simple figured bass accompaniment in quavers. The subject is then taken up in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> keyboard, while <b>the</b> violin part plays figures drawn from the continuo line, including characteristic quaver leaps in sixths. A two bar bridging passages with semiquaver scales in parallel thirds in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> leads into <b>the</b> statement of the fugue subject in the bass line, while <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> develop <b>the</b> accompanying motifs in syncopated exchanges. At the close semiquaver scales in the bass merge into the semiquaver arpeggios from the second interlude in the ritornello, which is reprised in full with <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> exchanged. It {{is followed by a}} reprise of the first interlude, which leads directly into a repetition of the entire fugal section with <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> exchanged. This time at the close the semiquaver scales in the bass line are joined by parallel scales in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>parts</b> for <b>the</b> final cadence that heralds the concluding rendition of the ritornello.|$|R

5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The heart is a tube in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> of the abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E
5|$|Mature {{specimens}} of Battarrea phalloides roughly resemble the typical agaric mushroom stature of stem and cap. However, {{rather than a}} cap with gills, this species has a spore sac atop the stem. When young, the fruit body is roughly spherical and completely encased in an outer wall (exoperidium) that later splits in a circumscissile fashion (along a circular or equatorial line), the lower wall forming a volva and <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> forming scales that cover the inner wall. <b>The</b> <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> rolls upward and backward and eventually falls away in one piece, exposing a spore sac lined with a narrow ring of capillitium and spores. The spores are sticky. As these are carried away by the wind, the drying action of the latter cause {{the edges of the}} peridium to shrivel and roll up more, exposing more spores. This is continued until the upper half of the peridium has shriveled and blown away and there remains only a few spores, which may be washed away by rain.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{transept}} chambers {{would have}} been covered with one large (or several smaller) capstones, enclosing the chambers containing human remains.

There is no record of a capstone having been discovered.|$|E
