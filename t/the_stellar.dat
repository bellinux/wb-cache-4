5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} interacts with <b>the</b> <b>stellar</b> wind. As the wind {{moves away from the}} star its rate of angular velocity slows.

5|$|On 13 December 1920, Betelgeuse {{became the}} first star outside the Solar System to have the angular size of its {{photosphere}} measured. Although interferometry was still in its infancy, the experiment proved a success. The researchers, using a uniform disk model, determined that Betelgeuse had a diameter of 0.047arcseconds, although <b>the</b> <b>stellar</b> disk was likely 17% larger due to the limb darkening, resulting in an estimate for its angular diameter of about 0.055". Since then, other studies have produced angular diameters that range from 0.042 to 0.069arcseconds. Combining these data with historical distance estimates of 180 to 815ly yields a projected radius of <b>the</b> <b>stellar</b> disk of anywhere from 1.2 to 8.9AU. Using the Solar System for comparison, the orbit of Mars is about 1.5AU, Ceres in the asteroid belt 2.7AU, Jupiter 5.5AU—so, assuming Betelgeuse occupying {{the place of the}} Sun, its photosphere might extend beyond the Jovian orbit, not quite reaching Saturn at 9.5AU.|$|E

40|$|Abridged] In {{this paper}} we derive <b>the</b> central <b>stellar</b> mass density within a fixed radius and <b>the</b> {{effective}} <b>stellar</b> mass density within the effective radius {{for a complete}} sample of 34 ETGs morphologically selected at 0. 9 2. Also, we show that the small scatter of the central mass density of ETGs compared to the large scatter of the effective mass density is simply a peculiar feature of the Sersic profile hence, independent of redshift and of any assembly history experienced by galaxies. Thus, it has no connection with the possible inside-out growth of ETGs. Finally, we find a tight correlation between <b>the</b> central <b>stellar</b> mass density and <b>the</b> total <b>stellar</b> mass of ETGs {{in the sense that}} the central mass density increases with mass as M^{~ 0. 6 }. This implies that the fraction of <b>the</b> central <b>stellar</b> mass of ETGs decreases with the mass of the galaxy. These correlations are valid for the whole population of ETGs considered independently of their redshift suggesting that they originate in the early-phases of their formation.

40|$|The recent star {{formation}} history (SFH) {{in the outer}} disk of NGC 300 is presented through the analysis of color magnitude diagrams (CMDs). We analyze resolved stellar photometry by creating CMDs from four Hubble Space Telescope fields containing a combination of images from the Advanced Camera for Surveys and the UVIS imager aboard the Wide Field Camera 3. From the best models of these CMDs, we derive the SFH in order to extract <b>the</b> young <b>stellar</b> component for <b>the</b> past 200 Myrs. We find that <b>the</b> young <b>stellar</b> disk of NGC 300 is unbroken out to at least ∼ 8 scale lengths (including an upper limit out to ∼ 10 scale lengths) with r_s = 1. 4 ± 0. 1 kpc, {{which is similar to}} <b>the</b> total <b>stellar</b> surface brightness profile.
