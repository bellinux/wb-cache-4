5|$|In {{response}} to Uncle Tom's Cabin, {{writers in the}} Southern United States produced {{a number of books}} to rebut Stowe's novel. This so-called Anti-Tom literature generally took a pro-slavery viewpoint, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> of slavery as depicted in Stowe's book were overblown and incorrect. The novels in this genre tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and a pure wife, both of whom presided over childlike slaves in a benevolent extended family style plantation. The novels either implied or directly stated that African Americans were a childlike people unable to live their lives without being directly overseen by white people.|$|E

5|$|On 31 January 2007, Autolink—Norways largest {{distributor}} of automobiles—bought 40% of Ofotbanen, and transferred their train haulage contract to them. This made Autolink Ofotbanen's largest customer. In March, Autolink ordered an additional 70 new autoracks for NOK 175 million. In June 2007, {{a new report}} from the Rail Inspectorate showed that Ofotbanen had severe safety problems—the company was using engineers without necessary licenses, and was not performing safety analysis. Director of the inspectorate, Erik Ø. Johnsen, stated that the inspectorate {{did not believe that}} Ofotbanen was taking safety seriously. CEO of Ofotbanen, Terje Østensen, felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> taken up by the inspectorate were mere formalities, and that it was difficult to make necessary documentation, stating that in his opinion, none of the procedures criticized actually influenced safety.|$|E

25|$|Escorpión {{tried to}} take {{advantage}} of the distraction to land a foul kick on Guerrero, only for Guerrero to block the move and then land a foul kick on Escorpión instead while the referee was still distracted. The underhanded tactics paid off as Guerrero took the third and deciding fall in a very heated main event. Following the match both parties made verbal threats to each other over the house microphones, indicating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> between the two factions were far from settled.|$|E

At the subsequent Triplemanía XXI show on June 16, 2013 Canek, former rival Universo 2000, Máscara Año 2000 and Villano IV lost to Dr. Wagner, Jr., Electroshock, La Parka and Octagón in a match that drew on the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> between Canek and Dr. Wagner Jr. were never resolved.|$|E
25|$|Reviewing the {{controversy}} as it unfolded and was {{printed in the}} North American Review, the nationally popular Daniel Webster followed both Dearborn and Putnam, and said of {{the controversy}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> concerned duty and character. Webster suggested that Dearborn stepped beyond the line of common decency by attempting to reprehend a widely respected war veteran who gave {{much of his life}} serving his country and who had long since been dead. In support of Putnam, Webster also provided several depositions from Colonels John Trumbull and Thomas Grosvenor along with various testimony from lesser known soldiers present at the battle, all of whom offered a different account of Putnam from Dearborn's.|$|E
25|$|In March 2004, {{the labor}} union {{representing}} Metro Transit bus workers went on strike. This delayed {{the opening of}} the line from the anticipated start date of April 3, although there was some indication that the opening would have been delayed anyway. Apparently, some of the delay had to do with slow delivery of trainsets from Bombardier. Certain aspects of the design had been tried before, but the cars were the first to combine the factors of conforming to American standards (as opposed to European), having low floors and being built at the company's Mexico plant. Some problems also cropped up during testing of the vehicles, but Bombardier said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> were not out of the ordinary.|$|E

25|$|Much {{as it had}} in the House, debate {{centered}} around the number of candidates in a contingency election and the philosophical underpinnings of the Constitution. Again, small Federalist states vehemently argued that three candidates gave too much power to large states to pick presidents. Senator Pierce Butler of South Carolina argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> with the election of 1800 were unlikely to happen again and he would not advocate changing the Constitution simply to stop a Federalist Vice President. John Quincy Adams argued that the change from five to three gave an advantage to the people that violated the federative principle of the Constitution. Rather than have the office of the President balanced between the states and the people, Adams felt designation of President and Vice President would tip that scale in favor of the people.|$|E
25|$|Sembène drew on many {{of these}} {{experiences}} for his French-language first novel, Le Docker Noir (The Black Docker, 1956), the story of Diaw, an African stevedore who faces racism and mistreatment on the docks at Marseille. Diaw writes a novel, which is later stolen by a white woman and published under her name; he confronts her, accidentally kills her, and is tried and executed in scenes highly reminiscent of Albert Camus's The Stranger (also translated as The Outsider). Though the book focuses particularly on the mistreatment of African immigrants, Sembène also details the oppression of Arab and Spanish workers, making it clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> are as much economic as they are racial. Like most of his fiction, it is written in a social realist mode. Many critics today consider the book somewhat flawed; however, it began Sembène's literary reputation and provided him with the financial support to continue writing.|$|E
25|$|Engraved {{portrayals of}} U.S. presidents {{were the only}} designs found on U.S. postage from 1847 until 1869, with the one {{exception}} of Benjamin Franklin, whose historical stature was {{comparable to that of}} a president, although his appearance was also an acknowledgement of his role as the first U. S. Postmaster General. During this period, the U.S. Post Office issued various postage stamps bearing the depictions of George Washington foremost, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln, the last of whom first appeared in 1866, one year after his death. After twenty-two years of issuing stamps with only presidents and Franklin, the Post Office in 1869 issued a series of eleven postage stamps that were generally regarded by the American public as being abruptly different from the previous issues and whose designs were considered at the time to be a break from the tradition of honoring American forefathers on the nation's postage stamps. These new issues had other nonpresidential subjects and a design style that was also different, one issue bearing a horse, another a locomotive, while others were depicted with nonpresidential themes. Washington and Lincoln were to be found only once in this series of eleven stamps, which some considered to be below par in design and image quality. As a result, this pictographic series was met with general disdain and proved so unpopular <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> were consequently sold for only one year where remaining stocks were pulled from post offices across the United States.|$|E

In response, Lockheed proposed an [...] "improved flight control system" [...] (ICS) to reduce rotor oscillations, and steps for removing excess weight and addressing other minor issues in production helicopters. The Army felt Lockheed's solutions to the cure-notice issues would delay the program and increase costs. Citing Lockheed's inability to meet the production timeline, the Army canceled the AH-56 production contract on 19 May 1969, but retained the development contract in hopes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> could be resolved.|$|E
