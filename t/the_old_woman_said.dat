I am sure any of us would know with half an eye, if we saw them together, how matters stood; but as for men, they are as blind as bats in such matters.

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{shall never}} come back here," [...] <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "never, even if I could. Paris is hateful to me now, and I have no reason for ever wanting to come back." ...|$|E

60|$|My lady went on {{with more}} talk of this kind, though, in truth, Esmond {{had no idea of}} what she said further, so entirely did her first words occupy his thought. Were they true? Not all, nor half, nor a tenth part of what <b>the</b> garrulous <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said,</b> was true. Could this be so? No ear had Esmond for {{anything}} else, though his patroness chatted on for an hour.|$|R

60|$|He {{was going}} to his work? <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said,</b> {{quickening}} hers, too, quite easily. Yes, time was nearly out. On his telling her where he worked, the old woman became a more singular old woman than before.|$|E
60|$|The third {{night the}} prince mounted the mare and rode {{her out to}} the meadows, with the foal {{trotting}} after. He tried hard to keep awake, but it was of no use, {{and in the morning}} there he was again on the log, grasping the halter. He started to his feet, and then stopped, for he remembered what <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> had <b>said,</b> and pulled out the wolf's grey lock.|$|R
6000|$|When the Princess Parizade held in {{her hands}} the three wonders promised her by <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman,</b> she <b>said</b> to <b>the</b> bird: [...] "All that is not enough.

6000|$|... "I {{like to be}} respectable, Mr Eames. I {{always have}} been respectable, Mr Eames." [...] This <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> almost in a whisper, looking anxiously {{to see that the}} door had not been opened to other {{listening}} ears.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I s'pose it is. Still, it ain't my notion. I don't like {{to climb}} hills well enough. Still, I've heard of people buildin' {{just for the}} view. It's all in taste, as <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> that kissed the cow." ...|$|E

60|$|This advice {{surprised}} {{the young man}} a good deal, as {{he did not see}} how it could help him; but he did not answer, and went down the road without knowing where he was going. At length he grew so tired he could walk no more; then he remembered what <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> had <b>said.</b> After he had rustled the leaves only once all fatigue disappeared, and he strode over the grass till he came to another little turf hut.|$|R
60|$|So when {{it began}} to grow dark the prince mounted the mare {{for the second time}} and rode into the meadows, and the foal trotted behind its mother. Again he managed to stick on till midnight: then a sleep overtook him that he could not battle against, and when he woke up he found himself, as before, sitting on the log, with the halter in his hands. He gave a shriek of dismay, and sprang up in search of the wanderers. As he went he {{suddenly}} remembered the words that <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> had <b>said</b> to <b>the</b> mare, and he drew out the fox hair and twisted it in his fingers.|$|R
60|$|Then she rowed away in her dough-trough, {{while the}} storm howled still louder than before, {{and the water}} dashed over their boat until it was almost sinking. Then the princes {{thought that there was}} {{something}} in what <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> had <b>said</b> about their mother, and being, of course, eager to save their lives, they shouted to her, and promised that she should have their brother if she would deliver them from this danger. As soon as they had done so the storm ceased and the waves fell. The boat drove ashore below their father's castle, and both princes were received with open arms by their father and mother, who had suffered great anxiety for them.|$|R
6000|$|... "You hain't never heared o' the Dunkards, I reckon," [...] <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> to Mrs. March. [...] "Some folks calls 'em the Beardy Men, {{because they}} don't never shave; and they wash feet {{like they do}} in the Testament. My uncle was one. He raised me." ...|$|E
60|$|SIR PATRICK. Remember the Frenchman {{who asked}} his {{grandmother}} {{at what age}} we get free from the temptations of love. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> she didn't know.

60|$|Having {{acquired}} {{a large number}} of the names of objects, Roger, for a time, came to a standstill. Then it struck him that by listening to what <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> to the girls, and by watching what they did, he might make a step farther.|$|E
60|$|Being {{upon this}} led into another Room, {{where there was}} but very little Light, yet enough to let him see {{that there was no}} body in it but himself and the Woman, he was desired to sit down in a Chair next to a Table, and <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Woman</b> {{clapping}} <b>the</b> Door too after her, he asked her why she shut the Door, and where was the Person she told him of? At which she answer'd there he is, pointing to a Chair at a little Distance: The young Gentleman turning his Head, saw a grave Kind of a Man sitting in an Elbow-Chair, tho' he said, he could have sworn there was no body in the Chair when <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Woman</b> shut <b>the</b> Door; however, having promis'd not to speak to any body but <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>Woman,</b> he <b>said</b> not a Word.|$|R

60|$|Hardly had he spoken, {{when the}} princess, {{who had been}} listening, ran up {{and kissed him on}} the forehead. Then the prince swung the dragon {{straight}} up into the clouds, and when he touched the earth again, he broke into a thousand pieces. Out of the pieces there sprang a wild boar and galloped away, but the prince called his hounds to give chase, and they caught the boar and tore it to bits. Out of the pieces there sprang a hare, and in a moment the greyhounds were after it, and they caught it and killed it; and out of the hare there came a pigeon. Quickly the prince let loose his hawk, which soared straight into the air, then swooped upon the bird and brought it to his master. The prince cut open its body and found the sparrow inside, as <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> had <b>said.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “It {{is three}} years and a half since I saw a golden guinea,” <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said</b> as {{she put on her}} bonnet, “and they won’t believe their eyes at the shop when I go in with it. You are sure you would like tea better than beer?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It is twenty {{year since}} I tasted spirits,” <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said,</b> “though John has often got a drop after a {{successful}} run; but this afternoon I don’t mind if I do try a little, {{if it is}} only to put the thought of them bonfiring negroes out of my mind.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It {{will buy}} me enough turf to last {{me all the}} winter,” <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> <b>said.</b> “My son is a {{fisherman}} who is sometimes weeks from home, and our supply of turf is running low. Thank you very much! though I would gladly {{have done it without}} reward, for we all hate the French.” ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed that}} {{after my mother}} fled to England with my father, de Garcia persecuted my {{grandmother}} and his aunt with lawsuits and by other means, till at last she was reduced to beggary, in which condition the villain left her to die. So poor was she indeed, that she was buried in a public grave. After that <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman,</b> my informant, <b>said</b> she had heard that de Garcia had committed some crime and been forced to flee the country. What the crime was she could not remember, but it had happened about fifteen years ago.|$|R
6000|$|Of {{course she}} went. When the three ladies entered the drawing-room of the Great House {{they found that}} Lady Julia had arrived just before them. Lady Julia {{immediately}} took hold of Lily, and led her apart, having {{a word or two}} to say about the clerk in the Income-tax Office. I am not sure but what <b>the</b> dear <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> sometimes <b>said</b> a few more words than were expedient, with a view to the object which she had so closely at heart. [...] "John is to be with us the first week in February," [...] she said. [...] "I suppose you'll see him before that, as he'll probably be with his mother a few days before he comes to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|By and by {{the ghost}} came, {{carrying}} his body on his back. He tried to throw his corpse into the first house, but it struck against the closed door and fell down again; so {{he picked it up}} and cast it at the next with like result. Thus he tried them all until he came to the last house, in which <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> lived; and here, because the door was open, the ghost succeeded and threw his body into the house. Quickly <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> seized <b>the</b> bundle and tossed it out again, but the ghost caught it and hurled it back. Thus they continued to send the body to and fro; but at last <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> seized her grandson by mistake and threw him out, at which the ghost cried, [...] "That is great! Now you have given me something to eat." [...] <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> then <b>said,</b> [...] "Throw him back again," [...] but the ghost replied, thinking to cheat her, [...] "Do you first throw out my body. Then I will throw him back." [...] So they argued until dawn was near, when <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>woman</b> shouted, [...] "The dawn is coming. Does that mean something for you or for me?" [...] Since the ghost replied, [...] "For me!" [...] the woman delayed until the day had come. The light of the sun put the ghost in danger, so he threw the grandson back and received his own body in return; but being no longer able to conceal himself, he was changed into a wild taro-plant, while his body became a piece of bark.|$|R
