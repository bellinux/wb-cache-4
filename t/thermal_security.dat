The doors are purchased as blanks and then modified to order. This includes putting in windows, peepsites, dead bolts, or decorative handles {{as well as}} painting or staining the doors. The windows are purchased complete, stored in the warehouse, and installed as ordered. The rolling shutters start out as raw materials. The poly vinyl chloride slats and covers are measured, cut, and assembled at TSP. Each one is custom made for an exact fit. B. S. (Bachelor of Science...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{security}} assessment is {{to verify the}} security of {{the current state of the}} system and find the secure regions within which the system can operate. In operations, a secure system involves respecting all operating criteria at pre- and post- contingency conditions. Operating limits include thermal, voltage and angle limits as well as all forms of stability. This thesis presents a computationally efficient and extremely fast method of computing real-time <b>thermal</b> <b>security</b> operating limits (SOLs) for any line imposed by reliability criteria for NERC 2 ̆ 7 s class B (i. e., N- 1) contingencies. The method makes use of linear sensitivity factors and is programmed in VC++ and integrated with the AREVA dispatch training simulator...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of bounds on voltage and <b>thermal</b> <b>security</b> margins with respect to contingencies. A margin is the maximal pre-contingency power transfer between either a generation and a load area or two generation areas, such that specirfied contingencies do not overload lines or make the system voltage unstable. The minimum and maximum margins are computed for given intervals of variations of bus injections. Each bound is the solution of a constrained L 1 -norm minimization (or maximization) problem, for which specific algorithms are given. Thermal overloads are handled through linearization, while for voltage stability, fast time simulation and instability mode analysis are used. Nonlinear situations of branch overload are also considered. The method is illustrated on an 80 -bus test system. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{traditionally}} passive {{nature of}} electrical distribution networks is changing as generation is connected {{within the context}} of a supportive regulatory framework and greater awareness of environmental issues. As the penetration of distributed generation becomes widespread, a myriad of issues with an increasingly network-wide scope arise, and have led to proposals for numerous techniques and devices to improve the management and operation of the network. Examples include: voltage regulation schemes, fault current limiters and active generation curtailment to mitigate <b>thermal</b> and <b>security</b> constraints. However, some major barriers still remain to be overcome before these are adopted by distrbution network operators, and many remain as predominately laboratory-scale demonstrations. This paper will introduce, justify and describe the actualscale network demonstrator being developed jointly by ScottishPower EnergyNetworks, Rolls-Royce and the University of Strathclyde, that will offer an environment within which the gap between research and field deployment can be bridge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a {{state of}} the art timing and {{positioning}} system based on 24 or more satellites launched and maintained by the United States government. Power engineering applications based on the GPS include phasor measurement, positioning applications such as surveying and mapping, and potentially in deriving real time data on transmission lines {{that will allow them to}} be loaded to a dynamic (<b>thermal</b> or <b>security)</b> limit. Inherent errors in GPS technologies are discussed, and the differential GPS method is described for accuracy enhancement. Further digital processing needs are necessary for meeting the accuracy requirements of certain specific applications. The focus of this paper is on the digital signal processing (DSP) of differential GPS (DGPS) measurements. The paper describes a methodology for further improving DGPS altitude measurements for the purpose of accurate determination of high voltage overhead conductor sag. The wavelet transforms and least squares parameter estimation (LSPE) techniques are considered...|$|R
40|$|A {{thermal runaway}} {{prognosis}} scheme for battery systems in electric vehicles is proposed {{based on the}} big data platform and entropy method. It realizes the diagnosis and prognosis of thermal runaway simultaneously, which {{is caused by the}} temperature fault through monitoring battery temperature during vehicular operations. A vast quantity of real-time voltage monitoring data is derived from the National Service and Management Center for Electric Vehicles (NSMC-EV) in Beijing. Furthermore, a <b>thermal</b> <b>security</b> management strategy for thermal runaway is presented under the Z-score approach. The abnormity coefficient is introduced to present real-time precautions of temperature abnormity. The results illustrated that the proposed method can accurately forecast both the time and location of the temperature fault within battery packs. The presented method is flexible in all disorder systems and possesses widespread application potential in not only electric vehicles, but also other areas with complex abnormal fluctuating environments...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{theoretical}} modelling and simulation of {{thermal energy storage}} (TES) by means of phase change materials (PCM) is very complex and its results are not close enough to experimental values. This paper presents the empirical study of a thermal storage unit operating with a commercial PCM called RT 25. The study is carried out {{by means of the}} statistical procedure, Design of Experiments. This methodology has rarely been used in the analysis of heat transfer problems. The present study has allowed us to investigate the phenomena involved and to design an actual system. We show the whole procedure followed in order to design the set-up, to run the experiments with a 23 factorial design, to compare its results with a numerical simulation and to get the empirical model by regression. Its results have been used to design actual installations aimed at free-cooling or maintaining the temperature constant in rooms where <b>thermal</b> <b>security</b> is necessary.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{preventive}} assessment and enhancement of voltage stability and security in electric power systems. However, in the course of deriving all the proposed methods we have paid attention to keeping them compatible with the (more traditional) handling of thermal overloads, thereby providing a unified treatment of voltage and <b>thermal</b> <b>security.</b> The approaches presented in this work apply to both deregulated environments and classical, vertically integrated ones. The heart of most methods developed in this thesis is : (i) the derivation of sensitivities indicating the relative efficiency of the various bus injections to restore voltage stability or increase an insufficient voltage security margin, and (ii) the use of these sensitivities in linearized security constraints that can be incorporated to various optimization problems. Using this formulation, we deal with three different problems of interest in preventive security analysis: 1) Congestion management. We propose two optimization-based approaches to manage congestions due to voltage instability and/or thermal overload. The control variables are either power injections (generation rescheduling and load curtailment) or power transactions; 2) Computation of Available Transfer Capabilities (ATCs). We determine the simultaneous ATCs of multiple transactions by means of a single optimization-based computation; 3) evaluation of security margins interval. To face the uncertainty affecting power transfers, we present an optimization-based computation of the minimal and maximal margins under the assumption that individual injections vary within specified bounds. Besides this main theme, the thesis offers additional reflections on the: 1) Filtering of contingencies. We propose a simple and reliable technique to filter out harmless contingencies when computing voltage security margins of a large set of contingencies; 2) Evaluation of reactive reserves with respect to a contingency, an important topic for voltage security reasons as well as {{within the context of a}} deregulated market where providing reactive reserves is an ancillary service which should be properly paid. Most of the methods proposed in this thesis were successfully tested on realistic power system models. From a practical viewpoint all the above computations have been coupled to the fast time-domain quasi steady-state simulation used in the ASTRE software developed at the University of Liège...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} of temporally and spatially coherent thermal emission {{has been demonstrated}} utilizing stacked gratings. We demonstrate that the metallic grating with narrow air slit behaves like a homogeneous slab with large permittivity and small permeability and find that {{the interaction between the}} metallic grating and the Bragg grating gives rise to impendence matching at wavelengths located in the photonic band gap of the Bragg grating, which enables the stacked gratings to perform high emission with ultranarrow spectrum and antenna-like spatial response. This paves the way towards the design of a novel infrared source platform for applications such as <b>thermal</b> analysis, imaging, <b>security,</b> biosensing, and medical diagnoses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. China {{is faced}} with {{significant}} challenges in the energy sector such as energy shortage, environmental pollution, greenhouse gas emission, and energy supply in rural areas, which severely restrict its sustainable development. In this paper, the current status and trends of <b>thermal</b> power industrial <b>security</b> issues based on sustainable energy development in China are elaborated. The strategies of sustainable energy in China are brought forward accordingly, such as efficient thermal power industry, green thermal power industry. The corresponding implementations of sustainable energy development in China are expounded as well. In the end, this paper concludes that China must set a step-by-step unified national energy plan to promote {{the construction of a}} sustainable energy system, which will be economically, environmentally, and socially viable, and, thus, China would play an important role to promote global sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to compute the Available Transfer Capability (ATC) of a power system under both <b>thermal</b> and voltage <b>security</b> constraints. The {{objective}} is to determine, in some optimal manner, the ATC of several simultaneous transactions, such that any postulated contingency does not cause voltage instability nor thermal overloads. Thermal constraints are derived for every branch likely to be overloaded in post-contingency states. Voltage security constraints are derived from voltage unstable post-contingency scenario, obtained by Quasi Steady- State simulation, a fast time-domain method. The paper also addresses the discrimination problem, i. e. {{the fact that the}} computed ATC might favor some trades to the detriment of others. Variants will be discussed to deal with such situations. The method is illustrated on an 80 -bus test system. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In the Nordic {{day-ahead}} electricity market zonal pricing or {{market splitting}} {{is used for}} relieving congestion between a predetermined set of bidding areas. This congestion management method represents an aggregation of individual connection points into bidding areas, and flows from the actual electricity network are only partly represented in the market clearing. Because of several strained situations in the power system during 2009 and 2010, changes in the congestion management method have been considered by the Norwegian regulator. In this paper we discuss nodal pricing in the Nordic power market, and compare it to optimal and simplified zonal pricing, the latter being used in today’s market. A model of the Nordic electricity market is presented together {{with a discussion of}} the calibration of actual market data for four hourly case studies with different load and import/exports to the Nordic area. The market clearing optimization model incorporates <b>thermal</b> and <b>security</b> flow constraints. We analyze the effects on prices and grid constraints and quantify the benefits and inefficiencies of the different methods. We find that the price changes with nodal pricing may not be dramatic, although in cases where intra-zonal constraints are badly represented by the aggregate transfer capacities in the simplified zonal model the nodal prices may be considerably higher on average and vary more than the simplified zonal prices. On the other hand nodal prices may vary less than the simplified zonal prices if aggregate transfer capacities are set too tightly. Allowing for more prices in the Nordic power market would make dealing with capacity limits easier and more transparent...|$|R
40|$|Overheating {{in new and}} {{retrofit}} {{low carbon}} dioxide homes is a growing issue in the UK due to climate change and other factors, with 99 % of existing housing predicted to be at medium to high risk if summer temperatures become 1 · 4 °C warmer. A year-long field study in two residential developments {{in the north of}} England monitored housing at three different scales: two-storey houses and three- and ten-storey blocks of flats. This revealed significant temperature stratification in the staircase zone, which allows a stack effect, as well as temperature differences between dwellings depending on their location in the building, both for summer and winter conditions even in the low-rise housing. Further investigation revealed that albedo and east–west orientation also contributed to non-linear overheating. Analyses of inhabitants’ <b>thermal</b> comfort and <b>security</b> practices as well as occupancy patterns also challenge the regulatory modelling used to predict building performance. It is suggested that these additional physical as well as user factors in residential developments need further investigation and should now be considered in relation to thermal comfort modelling...|$|R
40|$|Buildings {{are usually}} {{covered by a}} shell, {{in order to provide}} the desired comfort {{conditions}} inside the building. A right settled building shell, composed of roof and/or wall, which separates indoor and outdoor should provide, visual, <b>security,</b> <b>thermal,</b> audio, psychological etc. comfort conditions for users. In the designs of multiple functioned shopping spaces, esthetics, security, comfort and hospitality become the first aims while the conception of the building shells. Nowadays, building shells are increasing in variety, due to the improvement of building sector and the technological developments. Architects show their design talent by using the variety of building shells, either to invite the users inside the building or to provide the users intimacy. One of the important examples of building type, which emphasizes the building design concept through the variety of building shells, is the shopping space. In this paper, building shells were examined through the shopping spaces by their missions in the concept. Shopping has been a popular human activity since the very early ages.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to explore the design of public open spaces based on a multidimensional analysis useful to inform decision-making and foster the development of evidence-based architectural solutions. It presents an overview of the most relevant design variables and their constraints, providing, in this way, valuable information for the elaboration of a more sustainable urban design, considerate of the local socio-cultural values. This research aims at providing holistic guidance for the development of better design proposals in contemporary urban environments. More specifically, it seeks to synchronously characterize urban spaces at a multi-scale and multidimensional level, both quantitatively and qualitatively, by collecting contributions from Space Syntax Theory, Public Life Studies, Building Science and Environmental/Comfort Analysis in public open spaces. Many advanced digital tools are used for data management purposes and to generate and test iteratively different design proposals. The proposed methodology is based on a range of tests and analyses performed {{in the process of developing}} a new experimental project for Largo da Graça, an urban square located in Lisbon’s historic centre, which allowed the testing of different design solutions. This experiment generated a digital workflow for the design of the urban square, in which are registered all the steps undertaken to solve the many design problems identified by considering the efficiency targets (centrality, connectivity, enclosure, <b>thermal</b> comfort, <b>security,</b> social equity and interaction). The process comprises a sequence of comparative design reviews and records the choices made when dealing with latent information underlying changing conditions in the use of public space and the programmatic malleability of the Portuguese plaza. The description of the adopted design strategy and the examples extracted from the workflow are used to illustrate the practical approach of the proposed methodology. Ultimately, this study seeks to show how tightening the link between applied research and sustainable urban design can effectively support the design and planning of better public open spaces...|$|R
40|$|A {{modelling}} {{exercise was}} conducted to identify potential critical winter habitat for four ungulate species in the Robson Valley in east-central British Columbia: mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus nelsonii), and moose (Alces alces). The model was developed to provide land managers with an effective decision-making tool to include critical winter habitat in land-use planning. Forest cover data, biogeoclimatic data, and a digital elevation model were used to reflect snow depth, forage availability, <b>thermal</b> cover, and <b>security</b> cover values during winter months. The model identifies low-elevation, south-facing, older forests where snowpacks are less deep as potential critical winter habitat for deer and elk. Because moose are better adapted to northern Interior winter conditions, the model identifies coniferous and deciduous stands with greater forage poten-tial. Recent mild winters have limited the field validation process. Habitat assessment, using local sites as benchmarks for model evaluation, found that the distribution of resources varied within and between high-rated polygons and that the model overestimates the amount of critical ungulate winter habitat in the Robson Valley. Forage availability, followed by snow interception, were shown to be the limiting factors in most cases. The model is a broad filter of critical ungulate winter habitat; it is intended for field use as a management tool to identify the boundaries of critical winter range. The limitations of the model and priorities for improvement are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Background During 2012 – 15, £ 45 {{million was}} {{invested}} {{to improve the}} energy-efficiency of 4800 houses in low-income areas across Wales. Houses received measures such as external wall insulation, new windows and doors, upgrades to the heating system, and connection to the gas network. This study aimed to establish the short-term health and social impacts of these investments. Methods A quasi-experimental field study with a controlled, before and after design was conducted (364 individuals in improved houses [intervention], 418 in houses with no improvements [control]). Any adult living in 24 selected intervention areas and matched control areas (n= 23) was eligible for inclusion. Self-completed questionnaires, administered via a drop-off-and-collect method, were collected in the winter months (December to February) before and after installation of the energy efficiency measures. Health outcomes were mental health composite scale (MCS) and physical health composite scale (PCS) scores of the SF- 12 v 2, SF- 6 D utility scores derived from the SF- 12 v 2, self-reported respiratory symptoms, and subjective wellbeing. Social outcomes were financial difficulties and stress, food <b>security,</b> <b>thermal</b> comfort, housing conditions, and social isolation. The study used measures validated in previous research. Linear, ordered multinomial, and logistic multilevel models were constructed with measurement occasions nested within individuals. Findings After controlling for sex, age, housing benefit, household income, and smoking status, we found that investments were not associated with improvements in MCS (B= 0 · 00, 95...|$|R
40|$|Diversification of {{the energy}} mix {{is one of the}} main {{challenges}} in the energy agenda of governments worldwide. Technology advances together with environmental concerns have paved the way for the increasing integration of Distributed Generation (DG) seen over recent years. Combined heat and power and renewable technologies are being encouraged and their penetration in distribution networks is increasing. This scenario presents Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) with several technical challenges in order to properly accommodate DG developments. However, depending on various factors, such as location, size, technology and robustness of the network, DG might also be beneficial to DNOs. In this thesis, the impact of DG on network planning is analysed and the implications for DNOs in incorporating DG within the network planning process are identified. In the first part, various impacts of DG to the network, such as network <b>thermal</b> capacity release, <b>security</b> of supply and on voltage, are quantified through network planning by using a modified successive elimination method and voltage sensitivity analysis. The results would potentially assist DNOs in assessing the possibilities and effort required to utilise privately-owned DG to improve network efficiency and save investment. The quantified values would also act as a fundamental element in deriving effective distribution network charging schemes. In the second part, a novel balanced genetic algorithm is introduced as an efficient means of tackling the problem of optimum network planning considering future uncertainties. The approach is used to analyse the possibilities, potential benefits and challenges to strategic network planning by considering the presence of DG in the future when the characteristics of DG are uncertain...|$|R
