25|$|Cutler {{missed the}} next four games with his injury and McCown played well in his absence, leading to some {{controversy}} when Cutler was reinstated as the starting QB in Week 15. Cutler threw two interceptions {{in the first half}} against the Cleveland Browns, one returned for a touchdown, but ended with a 102.2 passer rating and <b>three</b> <b>TDs.</b> In the next week's 54–11 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Cutler ended up with 14,687 career passing yards for the Bears, one more than Sid Luckman's franchise record. The season finale was a winner-takes-the-division matchup at home against Green Bay. Despite Cutler's 15-of-24 passing for 226 yards, 2 TDs and 1 INT for a 103.8 passer rating, the Bears lost 33–28 on a last-minute Hail Mary, missing the playoffs with an 8–8 record. Cutler ended the season completing 224 of 355 passes for 2,621 yards, 19 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, and a career-high 89.2 passer rating.|$|E
25|$|On November 7, Houston's fourth {{field goal}} of the game came as time expired giving the 13th-ranked Cougars a 46-45 victory over the Tulsa Golden Hurricane in front of 20,243 fans at H.A. Chapman Stadium during a {{televised}} Saturday night game. Four turnovers, including two interceptions and two fumbles, and a 98-yard Houston kickoff return doomed the Hurricane. Tulsa's Charles Clay capped a 73-yard, 10 play touchdown drive with a one-yard run with 3:28 remaining in the game to put the Hurricane ahead 45–37. But the nation's top-ranked offense marched 61 yards in 13 plays in just 3:02 {{to close the gap}} to 45–43. The Cougars two-point conversion failed with just 0:21 on the clock, presumably giving the Hurricane a 45–43 victory. But, the Cougars recovered the subsequent onside kick at the Houston 39-yard line. Three plays later, Houston traveled to the Tulsa 34-yard line setting up the winning field goal. Tulsa's G.J. Kinne became the first quarterback in school history to pass for 300 yards and rush for 100 yards in the same game, as he finished with 334 passing yards and <b>three</b> <b>TDs,</b> and 100 rushing yards and one touchdown. Charles Clay scored four touchdowns, two rushing and two receiving for the Hurricane, while Damaris Johnson totaled a career-best 324 all-purpose yards. Houston totaled 695 total yards on a new Tulsa opponent record of 100 plays, while the Hurricane gained a season-best 534 total yards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In DS-CDMA communications, the {{conventional}} receiver is the RAKE receiver. In the downlink (base station to mobile) signalling with cell-dependent scrambling, orthogonal codes {{and a common}} channel for all the users, this receiver does not maximize the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) at its output. Another receiver, with the same structure as the RAKE receiver, is suitable for downlink DS-CDMA communications; {{the one in which}} the channel matched filter gets replaced by a filter that is designed to maximize the SINR at the receiver output. In this paper, we analyze the use of three different Transmission Diversity (TD) techniques, namely Space-Time TD (STTD), Orthogonal TD (OTD) and Delay TD (DTD). All of them are compared for the two receiver structures: RAKE and max-SINR receivers. The max-SINR receiver structures proposed here for the <b>three</b> <b>TD</b> modes are new and are shown to usually significantly outperform the RAKE schemes. We also discuss the relative performance merits of the <b>three</b> <b>TD</b> schemes for one or the other receiver structure. I...|$|R
