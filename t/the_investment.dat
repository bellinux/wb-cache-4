30|$|Figure  1 {{presents}} the percentage change in <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> of <b>the</b> government, households, and {{rest of the}} world from the benchmark. It is obvious from the figure that <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> of <b>the</b> government and households were positive, whereas <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> of <b>the</b> {{rest of the world}} were negative. This implies that after <b>the</b> simulation, <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> of government and households increased continuously, whereas <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> of <b>the</b> rest of the world declined. It {{is important to note that}} <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> here represented both real and financial <b>investments.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> figure shows that change in government investments was considerably greater than <b>the</b> change in <b>investments</b> by households. This result was expected because the ECB’s action assumed the government would increase its expenditure after receiving money from the bank’s bond purchases. Therefore, the percentage change in the level of government investments was greater than the change in household investments.|$|R
