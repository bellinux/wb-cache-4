5|$|At Columbia, John R. Dunning {{believed}} {{that this was the}} case, but Fermi was not so sure. The only way <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>this</b> was to obtain a sample of uranium 235 and test it. He got Alfred O. C. Nier from the University of Minnesota to prepare samples of uranium enriched in uranium-234, 235 and 238 using a mass spectrometer. These were ready in February 1940, and Dunning, Eugene T. Booth and Aristid von Grosse then carried out a series of experiments. They demonstrated that uranium-235 was indeed primarily responsible for fission with slow neutrons, but were unable to determine precise neutron capture cross sections because their samples were not sufficiently enriched.|$|E
25|$|The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature tried <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>this</b> {{issue in}} 1956 by declaring Colymbus a {{suppressed}} name unfit for further use and establishing Gavia, created by Johann Reinhold Forster in 1788, as the valid genus {{name for the}} loons. However, the situation was not completely resolved even then, and the following year the ICZN had to act again to prevent Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot's 1818 almost-forgotten family name Urinatoridae from overruling the much younger Gaviidae. Some eminent ornithologists such as Pierce Brodkorb {{tried to keep the}} debate alive but the ICZN's solution has been satisfactory.|$|E

Subsequently, Cantonese people and businesses also began <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> onto <b>this</b> street, as Manhattan's Chinatown was expanding into {{other parts of the}} Lower East Side, and Manhattan's Chinatown Chinese population was very vastly Cantonese-dominated at the time. During this time period, Manhattan's Chinatown was being referred as a growing Little Hong Kong. Vietnamese people also began <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> on <b>this</b> street as well.|$|R

25|$|In 1785, Catherine {{approved}} the subsidisation of new mosques and new town settlements for Muslims. This was {{another attempt to}} organise and passively control the outer fringes of her country. By building new settlements with mosques placed in them, Catherine attempted to ground many of the nomadic people who wandered through southern Russia. In 1786, she assimilated the Islamic schools into the Russian public school system, to be regulated by the government. The plan was another attempt to force nomadic people <b>to</b> <b>settle.</b> <b>This</b> allowed the Russian government to control more people, especially those who previously had not fallen {{under the jurisdiction of}} Russian law.|$|E
25|$|Thick forest once {{covered the}} eastern coastal plain, where the Amerindians built their first {{settlements}} during the Aceramic period, complimenting the ecosystem surrounding the coral reef just offshore. It was the {{easy access to}} fresh water {{on the island and}} the rich food source represented by the ocean life sheltered by the reef that made it feasible for the Amerindians <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>this</b> area around 600 BC. With the loss of the natural vegetation, the balance in runoff nutrients to the reef was disturbed, eventually causing as much as 80 percent of the large eastern fringing reef to become inactive. As the reef broke apart, it in turn provided less protection for the coastline.|$|E
25|$|In 1630, English Puritans {{arrived in}} Providence Island, {{under the aegis}} of the Providence Island Company. These Puritans decided <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>this</b> {{promising}} tropical island rather than cold, rocky New England, but the Providence Island colony did not succeed in the same way as the Massachusetts Bay Colony. They established slave-worked plantations and engaged in privateering, which led to the capture of the colony by Spain in 1641, who had claimed it a century earlier. In the 1640s, the Puritan-controlled Commonwealth government of England tried to regain the island, but without success. In 1670, English buccaneers led by Henry Morgan took over the islands, which they are connected to the British Mosquito Coast in present-day Nicaragua. The buccaneers and other pirates controlled the islands until 1689. Later Spain regained control of the archipelago, which it held until the independence of Colombia in 1822.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} closely contested by {{throughout}} the night as the lead changed 12 separate times, and the game was tied on 18 occasions. Regulation was not enough <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>this</b> game, so the game went into overtime. The Pistons streaked out to a quick lead {{in the first few}} minutes of overtime, and seemed to have the game in hand. However, a missed layup by Chauncey Billups with Detroit ahead 95-93 with nine seconds left San Antonio with a chance. On the Spurs' next possession, Robert Horry inbounded the ball to Ginobili, who headed for the left corner and dished it right back to Horry. Rasheed Wallace had left Horry to double-team Ginobili, and Horry was left alone to sink the game-winning basket with 5.8 seconds remaining in the OT. Horry was already famous for nailing last-second shots in the playoffs, including Game Four of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Lakers and Sacramento Kings.|$|E
25|$|Egil {{missed the}} wedding {{on account of}} illness, and joined Thorir's men on an errand in Atloy, where he was slighted by the king's steward Bard (Bárðr), and wound up killing him. When Bard {{received}} Egil's party, he would only serve curd (skyr) to drink, pretending ale had run out. But later that night when king and queen arrived for the feast to the dísir, ale was served plentifully. Egil relentlessly jibed Bard about the deceit with sarcastic poetry, and his unquenchable thirst embarrassed the host. Bard and the queen sent Egil a poisoned drink, but the attempt was foiled by Egil, who inscribed runes on the horn and besmeared it with his own blood, causing the horn to shatter. Egil then went up to Bard and stabbed him to death with his sword. Discovering Egil had fled, Eirik ordered an unsuccessful manhunt to have Egil killed, and lost several men. Despite the affront, Eirik was persuaded by Thorir (his foster-father) <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>this</b> by compensation.|$|E
25|$|The colony was {{established}} on November 7, 1924, and was initially named Colonia Regina de Alvear, {{in honor of}} the first lady, Regina Pacini de Alvear. Héctor Valsecchi was named the first president of the company. Bonoli and his helper, Emilio Bignami, planned the organization and development of the area. The company spent most of its starting capital of US$1.4 million buying the 5,000 hectares. During the first year, they worked 1,300 hectares, which were divided into lots of 5, 10 and 15 hectares. <b>To</b> <b>settle</b> <b>this</b> area, the company gave preference to the Italian immigrants that already lived in Argentina. During the second stage, the company cultivated 1,200 hectares; these were given to Italian families that wanted to immigrate to Argentina. Those in this second wave of settlement were selected by the officials of the company. By 1927, 1,000 people had settled in the town. Soon a hospital, a church, a school, a library and a sports club were built. The Bank of Rome gave the settlement a loan of 5 million lire, in spite of Benito Mussolini's plan to use that money to support Italian workers in Italy. Further loans to the settlement were leveraged by Bonoli's connection to Ottavio Dinale. Dinale, a collaborator of Mussolini, had influence with the General Commissariat of Emigration (Italian: Commissariato Generale dell'Emigrazione). The loans were given by the Banca Commerciale Italiana, through the Francés y Italiano para América del Sur bank and the Italia y Río de la Plata bank.|$|E

[...] Accolade's Alan Miller expressed more excitement with the settlement and the opportunities it presented for the company, saying in his statement, [...] "We are very pleased with the settlement, and we're excited about the new markets it opens to Accolade. Accolade currently experiences strong demand for its Sega Genesis products in North America and Europe. We will now be able to publish our products on the Sega Genesis and Game Gear systems throughout the world." [...] Despite the settlement, however, Accolade had lost somewhere between $15 million and $25 million during the injunction period, according to Miller.|$|E
500|$|The Mayflower {{anchored}} at Provincetown Harbor on November 11, 1620. The Pilgrims did {{not have}} a patent <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>this</b> area; thus, some passengers began to question their right to land, complaining that there was no legal authority to establish a colony. In response to this, a group of colonists drafted and ratified the first governing document of the colony, the Mayflower Compact, while still aboard the ship as it lay off-shore. The intent of the compact was to establish a means of governing the colony, though it did little more than confirm that the colony would be governed like any English town. It did, however, serve the purpose of relieving the concerns of many of the settlers. This social contract was written and signed by 41 Separatist men. It was modeled on the church covenants that [...] Congregationalists used to form new congregations. It made clear that the colony should be governed by [...] "just and equal laws," [...] and those who signed it promised to keep these laws.|$|E

The book received great critical acclaim. A 1940 review for the Saturday Review of Literature reads: [...] "No other books more clearly reveals the aid which Stalin gave to Hitler before he won power". As a result, he Valtin/Krebs was invited to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee as regards Soviet secret activities in Europe.|$|E

He is notable for having translated and made commentaries upon the work of Pseudo-Dionysius, initially thought to be from the apostolic age. [...] Around this period several doctrinal controversies emerged, such as the question of whether God had predestined some for salvation and some for damnation. [...] Eriugena was called in <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>this</b> dispute. [...] At the same time, Paschasius Radbertus raised an important question about the real presence of Christ at the Eucharist.

2500|$|In Malaysia, {{the master}} {{franchisee}} agreement was terminated on 5 January 2017 by La Kaffa International due to contractual dispute with its country master franchisee, Loob Holdings. This legal dispute {{attracted the attention}} of local media and is currently in arbitration in Singapore. La Kaffa held a press conference in Kuala Lumpur announcing it would be taking over the Malaysian Chatime business operations and development with immediate effect. [...] This however appears to be largely incorrect with Loob Holdings rebranding 161 out of 165 Chatime outlets to Tealive brand on 17 February 2017. Due to Loob Holdings' alleged use of unapproved ingredients (which were later found out to be collaborations with other brands for locallization purposes [...] ), questionable practices, and a blatant breach of the terms of contract, La Kaffa International director Chen Zhao sought an injunction against the former master franchisee from operating a similar (bubble tea) business in Malaysia. On 29 May 2017, the High Court dismissed the injunction bid by La Kaffa International, against Loob Holding Sdn Bhd, from carrying a similar business as Chatime. Judicial Commissioner Wong Kian Kheong, in his oral judgement, ruled that the injunction would cause great risk of injustice to Loob Holding and its business and also associates. The court also found that the franchise termination by La Kaffa was done in bad faith. While both companies have taken their dispute to the Singapore International Arbitration Centre, La Kaffa reportedly tries to persuade LooB Holdings <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>this</b> matter outside court.|$|E
