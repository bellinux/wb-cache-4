40|$|A novel {{combination}} of living polymerization reactions {{has been proposed}} for the controlled synthesis of poly(alkyl methacrylate) -graft-polylactones. This strategy relies upon the sequential living polymerization of alkyl methacrylates and aliphatic lactones, with an intermediate chemical transformation for shifting from the first mechanism to the second one. In the first step, an alkyl methacrylate (methyl and butyl) is copolymerized with 2 -trimethylsiloxyethyl methacrylate (TMSEMA). This living anionic polymerization is initiated with diphenylhexyllithium(DPHLi) {{in the presence of}} a μ-ligand, lithium chloride, in THF at - 78 °C. The trimethylsiloxy groups are then hydrolyzed with release of hydroxyl groups which are reacted with <b>triethylaluminum</b> in order to form a multifunctional macroinitiator of the Al alkoxide type.
