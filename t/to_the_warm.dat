5|$|Colbert {{received}} a chilly reception from the audience. His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, although {{some in the}} audience, such as Scalia, laughed heartily as Colbert teased them. This was in stark contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> reception accorded to a skit featuring Bush and his look-alike, Steve Bridges, which immediately preceded Colbert's monologue.|$|E
5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian Cyclone Model are the fracture of the cold front, treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, and allowing the cold front to progress through the warm sector perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> {{waters of}} the Great Salt Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} phenomena of the surrounding area. Cold north, northwest, or west winds generally blow across the lake following {{the passage of a}} cold front, and the temperature difference between the warm lake and the cool air can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.|$|E
50|$|In {{this and}} other novels of the series, Cadfael makes wine for his guests. In the 12th century, this was possible, there were {{vineyards}} in southern England. This may be due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warmer</b> climate in northern Europe. Whether it is solely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warmer</b> climate, or solely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> preference for wine over beer brought by the Norman nobility and French monks, {{or a combination of}} both is debated. The number of vineyards declined in following centuries.|$|R

5|$|On April 5, 2001, a new {{forecast}} was issued, {{calling for}} 12 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. The {{increase in the}} forecast was attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> sea surface temperatures, although the agency noted that the season would likely not be as active as previous ones due {{to the effect of}} a weak to moderate El Nino. The estimated potential for at least one major hurricane to affect the U.S. was upped slightly to 65 percent; the East Coast potential also went up slightly, and from the Florida Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability remained nearly the same.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast with a closed circulation on August 3. It tracked westward across the tropical waters of the Atlantic Ocean and broke into two distinct parts, the northern portion eventually became Hurricane Alberto. The southern portion continued to track westward into the Caribbean Sea, while producing little or no deep convection. The wave reached Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula on August 12, and only then did deep convection redevelop, mostly due to diurnal heating. The wave emerged over the Bay of Campeche early on August 13 as a large area of low pressure. The wave was upgraded to Tropical Depression Five later that day, based on satellite intensity estimates and an observation from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft. Six hours after developing, the depression was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane early on August 16 due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> waters of the Gulf of Mexico and little wind shear to inhibit development.|$|E
5|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Gulf of Oman, the cyclone briefly re-intensified slightly, possibly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> waters. However, increasing wind shear and entrainment of dry {{air from the}} Arabian Peninsula continued to remove deep convection from its eastern semicircle. On June 6, the cyclone turned to the north-northwest, and later that day the JTWC downgraded Gonu to tropical storm status. The IMD followed suit by downgrading Gonu to severe cyclonic storm status and later to cyclonic storm status early on June 7. Gonu crossed the Makran coast in Iran six hours later and the IMD stopped issuing advisories on the cyclone. This made it the first tropical cyclone on record to hit the country since 1898. After landfall, Gonu persisted as a remnant low over Iran through June 8.|$|E

5|$|For {{three of}} the novels, Goldfinger, Live and Let Die and Dr. No, it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what {{turns out to be}} an American problem, and Black points out that {{although}} it is American assets that are under threat in Dr. No, a British agent and a British warship, HMS Narvik, are sent with British soldiers to the island {{at the end of the}} novel to settle the matter. Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his comments in the penultimate novel You Only Live Twice reflect this; Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America—in sharp contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm,</b> co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 1944, Stauffenberg and his {{adjutant}} Lieutenant Haeften {{return to}} Wolf's Lair. To Stauffenberg's dismay, he discovers {{only after the}} timer has been activated that, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> weather, the conference {{is being held in}} an open-window summer barrack, whereas the plotters had intended to detonate the bomb within the walls of the bunker for maximum damage. While his adjutant waits with the car, Stauffenberg places the briefcase with the bomb armed at the meeting as close to Hitler as possible. Stauffenberg then leaves the barrack, returning to the car. However, one of the officers at the meeting moves the bomb behind a table leg, which will inadvertently protect Hitler from most of the blast. When the bomb explodes, Stauffenberg is certain that Hitler is dead and flees Wolf's Lair. Before shutting down communications, Fellgiebel calls Mertz about the explosion but cannot clearly convey whether or not Hitler is dead.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, on 21 October 1968, with the first scene shot being an aerial view of Bond climbing the stairs of Blofeld's mountain retreat. The scenes were shot atop the now-famous revolving restaurant Piz Gloria, located atop the Schilthorn {{near the village of}} Mürren. The location was found by production manager Hubert Fröhlich after three weeks of location scouting in France and Switzerland. The Swiss filming ended up running 56 days over schedule. In March 1969 production moved to England, with London's Pinewood Studios being used for interior shooting, and M's house being shot in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. In April the filmmakers went to Portugal, where principal photography wrapped in May. Filming finished on 23 June, two months later than planned, which was largely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> Swiss winter, which had hampered shooting.|$|E

5|$|The use of wool in {{the uniform}} {{meant that the}} uniforms were not suited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> climates that were common in the South. This contributed to many Confederate {{soldiers}} suffering from heatstroke on long marches. However, one understanding of the heavy woolen garments is that after the marching during the day time, when the soldiers would rest at night and cool themselves down, the thermal-shock could render some men unable to function the next day. As such, the woolen garments would protect the soldiers from this, and keep them able to keep marching {{the next day to}} fulfill their duties. This was also the case with the better equipped U.S. Army. Many Confederate soldiers started the war with frock coats. However, cloth shortages and wartime wear insured that, by 1863, waist-length cadet gray or butternut shell jackets were generally worn by Confederates in the Eastern and Western Theater. Examples of frock coats being worn by enlisted men can be seen in photographs taken after the battles of Gettysburg, (1863), and Spotsylvania, (1864).|$|E
5|$|During late August {{and into}} early September 1961, an unusual series of {{low-level}} disturbances developed over Central and West Africa {{and into the}} eastern Atlantic Ocean. One of these systems, that probably formed over Central Africa {{at the end of}} August, became increasingly organized as it moved over Nigeria on September1. As the disturbance travelled steadily westward, its mid-level circulation became well defined, and the accompanying low-level centre gradually followed suit. An upper-level anticyclone accompanied the storm during this entire period, providing a favorable upper-air regime for strengthening. According to a post-storm study in 1962, all the necessary environmental ingredients were available to the disturbance while it was over land; the only factor inhibiting earlier development was a lack of access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> waters. Around 1200UTC on September5, the low emerged off the coast of Senegal as a strong tropical depression or tropical storm. By this time, the system had a central pressure below 1006mbar (hPa; 29.71inHg), and sustained winds of 35mph (55km/h) were reported in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. As the system neared Cape Verde, it continued to intensify and by the evening of September6, reports from the nearby Danish tanker Charlotte Maersk indicated that the system was already at or near hurricane intensity.|$|E

50|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second law of {{thermodynamics}} heat cannot spontaneously {{flow from}} a colder location to a hotter area; work {{is required to}} achieve this. An air conditioner requires work to cool a living space, moving heat from the cooler interior (<b>the</b> heat source) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warmer</b> outdoors (<b>the</b> heat sink). Similarly, a refrigerator moves heat from inside the cold icebox (<b>the</b> heat source) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warmer</b> room-temperature air of the kitchen (the heat sink). The operating principle of the refrigeration cycle was described mathematically by Sadi Carnot in 1824 as a heat engine. A heat pump {{can be thought of}} as a heat engine which is operating in reverse.|$|R
25|$|Plantings of Carignan {{are mostly}} limited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>warm</b> Mediterranean climates of {{southern}} France {{due to the}} grape's inability to sufficiently ripen much further north in the continental climate of central France or in the damp maritime climate of Southwest France.

25|$|In cold weather, {{the outdoor}} unit {{of an air}} source heat pump needs to be {{intermittently}} defrosted.
