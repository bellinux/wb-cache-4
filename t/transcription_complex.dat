40|$|Recent data {{reveal that}} gene {{transcription}} affects genome stability in mammalian cells. For example, transcription of DNA that is {{damaged by the}} most prevalent exogenous genotoxin, UV light, induces nucleotide substitutions and chromosomal instability, collectively called UV-induced transcription-associated mutations (UV-TAM). An important class of UV-TAM consists of nucleotide transitions that are caused by deamination of cytosine-containing photolesions to uracil, presumably occurring at stalled <b>transcription</b> <b>complexes.</b> Transcription-associated deletions and recombinational events after UV exposure may be triggered by collisions of replication forks with stalled <b>transcription</b> <b>complexes.</b> In this Point-of-View, we propose that mammalian cells possess two tailored mechanisms to prevent UV-TAM in dermal stem cells. First, the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCR) pathway removes lesions at transcribed DNA strands, forming the primary barrier against the mutagenic consequences of transcription at a damaged template.

40|$|Stimulation of {{transcriptional}} elongation by {{the human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein is mediated by CDK 9, a kinase that phosphorylates the RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD). In order to obtain direct evidence that this phosphorylation event can alter RNA polymerase processivity, we prepared <b>transcription</b> elongation <b>complexes</b> that were arrested by the lac repressor. The CTD was then dephosphorylated by treatment with protein phosphatase 1. The dephosphorylated <b>transcription</b> <b>complexes</b> were able to resume the transcription elongation when IPTG (isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside) and nucleotides {{were added to the}} reaction. Under these chase conditions, efficient rephosphorylation of the CTD was observed in complexes containing the Tat protein but not in <b>transcription</b> <b>complexes</b> prepared in the absence of Tat protein. Immunoblots and kinase assays with synthetic peptides showed that Tat activated CDK 9 directly since the enzyme and its cyclin partner, cyclin T 1, were present at equivalent levels in <b>transcription</b> <b>complexes</b> prepared in {{the presence or absence of}} Tat.

Under these conditions there was no rephosphorylation of the CTD during elongation, and transcription through either a stem-loop terminator or bent DNA arrest sequence was strongly inhibited. In experiments in which the CTD was phosphorylated prior to elongation, the amount of readthrough of the terminator sequences was proportional to the extent of the CTD modification. The change in processivity is due to CTD phosphorylation alone, since even after the removal of Spt 5, the second substrate for CDK 9, RNA polymerase elongation is enhanced by Tat-activated CDK 9 activity. We conclude that phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II CTD by CDK 9 enhances transcription elongation directly...|$|R
