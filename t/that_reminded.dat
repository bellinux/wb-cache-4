5|$|Siliconera writer Rolando again {{echoed the}} {{necessity}} for understanding Japanese due to the game's text-heavy nature while noting the plot was quite simple and in common with other Monolith Soft titles, but otherwise generally praised the gameplay mechanics and noted that multiplayer would be fun {{despite the lack of}} WiFi functionality. In conclusion, he positively compared Soma Bringer to console turn-based role-playing game Lost Odyssey: while it brought nothing new to the genre, it was a nostalgic experience <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> players of the genre's worth. English previews positively compared the gameplay to the Mana series, with 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish also noting it feeling familiar to gameplay from the Diablo series. These comparisons were also shared by other reviewers.|$|E
5|$|Introduced in Soul Edge, Li Long is {{an assassin}} {{sent by the}} Emperor of China to kill a pirate lord, but failed. Badly injured, he was rescued by a woman named Chie and {{eventually}} {{fell in love with}} her. While out one day, a fight broke out at the inn and Chie was believed to be dead. Told falsely the swordsman Heishirō Mitsurugi was responsible, he set out after Soul Edge knowing Mitsurugi was also after the blade. Along the way he takes the weapons of other fighters he defeats, repurposing some for his own use. Upon finding and defeating him, he realized Mitsurugi had no part in the attack upon Chie, and continued his goal of searching for Soul Edge. He located its wielder, Cervantes, but was beaten severely. Revealed to have survived in Soulcalibur III but having lost an eye, he found himself on the run from assassins sent by his former employer. Traveling by night under a false name, he was taken in by a girl <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> him of Chie. When the assassins eventually found him, Li Long stood his ground and defeated them. Remembering the feel of fighting for something other than revenge, he set out to find himself, not knowing that Chie was actually alive and, after giving birth to their son, had set out to find him.|$|E

Participants were asked to retrieve a memory <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> them of the cue- word, recall memories from across their lifespan, and recall memories that were at least a year old. Then participants were asked to date the memory to the nearest month and year. The results were graphed on a lifespan retrieval curve, and the reminiscence bump was observed.|$|E
25|$|Alfred was {{heir to the}} Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Expecting to be the Duchess there, Maria Alexandrovna had {{a palace}} built for her family in Coburg. The building, known as the Edinburgh Palais, was built across the central square from the Schloss Ehrenburg, the {{official}} residence of the reigning duke, and next to the town's opera hall. The royal couple's rooms were on the second floor, while the bedrooms of the four young princesses were on the third floor. Both the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh were avid collectors. In the Edinburgh Palais, there were many objects <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> Maria Alexandrovna of her homeland. As a reminder of Russia, Maria Alexandrovna organised entertainment in the Russian fashion.|$|E

25|$|On {{his arrival}} in Sydney, Blacket possessed a small library of {{architectural}} books, and he kept abreast of the latest trends by subscribing to journals. Although {{there were a number}} of buildings with Gothic details in the colony at the time, in particular the existing south transept of the new cathedral, these structures had strongly Classical elements beneath their medieval detailing. Blacket was the first architect in Australia who truly understood the principles of the Gothic style and who could design a church that would satisfy the august societies of Oxford and Cambridge. Since it was the wish of so many colonials, not the least of whom was the Bishop, to assuage their homesickness by at least attending a church <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> them of one in Cornwall, Yorkshire or East Anglia, Edmund Blacket was to become a very popular man.|$|E

Jason Bulmahn used the module, {{as well as}} Indiana Jones, as inspiration {{for some of the}} traps in the 2007 D supplement Dungeonscape. The computer role-playing game Icewind Dale, developed by Black Isle Studios, was influenced by the module; Black Isle Studios division director Feargus Urquhart said, [...] "We wanted something <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> everyone of their first foray into dungeons like the Tomb of Horrors, with traps around every corner, and the undead crawling out of the walls." ...|$|E

Following the talks, he was described as [...] "Much better than Varoufakis". Greece was given 48 hours to agree to a new bailout plan or it would face being forced to leave the eurozone on 8 July, leading to a plan being submitted by the Greek government on 10 July. In a nine-hour Eurogroup meetings on 11 July, Tsakalotos was noted for his calmness in the [...] "tough, even violent" [...] atmosphere of the talks by observers.|$|E

[...] Heston and Sweeley were singled out for praise in the account of the game published in The Michigan Alumnus:"Two men, Sweeley and Heston, constantly won the plaudits of the rooters by their long gains around the ends.

500|$|According to Wisden in 1901, as a batsman Ollivierre [...] "was {{particularly}} strong in cutting and playing to leg". J. N. Pentelow, a cricket writer, suggested in 1928 that [...] "there {{was something about}} Ollivierre <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> {{one of the great}} Ranji. He was a more heavily built man than the slim Ranji of the days when we were young; but his strokes and his movements had real grace." [...] A correspondent in the Observer in 1931 remembered Ollivierre as a [...] "great batsman", while Neville Cardus, writing in 1920, named Ollivierre among a list of top-quality batsmen who did not do themselves justice at the highest level: [...] "Geniuses who have just lost their way...every one of them in possession of an excellent enough record in county cricket, but every one of them really intended by nature to wear the most precious laurels the greatest of games has to offer".|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|The four {{officers}} were {{taken aback by}} Taylor's searing words and felt they had been humiliated. A decade after the incident, Kỳ described Taylor as [...] "the sort of man who addressed people rather than talked to them", referencing the confrontation. Karnow said [...] "For the sake of their own pride, they [...] resented being treated in ways <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> them of their almost total dependence on an alien power. How could they preserve a sense of sovereignty when Taylor, striving to push them into 'getting things done', behaved like a viceroy?" [...] However, Thi also took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said [...] "Because {{this is one of}} the happiest days of my life...Today I told the American ambassador that he could not dictate to us." [...] Nevertheless, Taylor's conduct had rankled the officers, stirring their latent sense of nationalism and anti-Americanism; Khánh would exploit this to strengthen his fragile position in the junta.|$|E

Brittany connected with Santana, a brief scene <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> me how far both characters have come this season.

[...] Canning said it was a [...] "nice denouement, putting everyone at peace for having failed to reach the top ten at Nationals and getting their hopes high for next year." [...] Hankinson credited Brittany with some of the funniest lines in the episode as well as the most important scene—in the epilogue with Santana—and he was impressed with her lead vocals throughout. He concluded, [...] "She's the M.V.P. of the night and possibly the season." ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-2013, a {{relatively}} unknown artist Boots, signed a publishing deal with Jay-Z's Roc Nation. In {{an interview for}} Pitchfork after the album's release, Boots was coy when answering questions about how Beyoncé discovered his demo or of his work previous to the project, only confirming his signing. In June 2013, they met in person {{for the first time}} and Boots presented Beyoncé with material he felt would resonate with her. However, Beyoncé was more interested in his experimental material, and he reluctantly played her his song [...] "Haunted" [...] on his cellphone. She refused to ignore its potential. At a later meeting, he played her a stream of consciousness rap called [...] "Ghost", which he wrote after an exasperating meeting with a potential record label. Boots began by composing a melody <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> him of a hypnotic state, then layering guitar arpeggios to resemble the work of English electronic musician Aphex Twin. Subsequently, [...] "Ghost" [...] became the first half of [...] "Haunted"; he later described Beyoncé as the [...] "only visionary in the room" [...] for her ability to find potential in scraps of songs. Following these sessions, Boots would go on to work on eighty percent of Beyoncé.|$|E
500|$|Music writers opine that Ride the Lightning {{exhibited}} greater musical maturity, with sonically broader songs than Kill 'Em All, {{which was}} {{noted for its}} one-dimensional sound. This was partially because of bassist Cliff Burton's knowledge of music theory. He showed Hetfield how to augment core notes with complementary counter-melodies and how basic guitar harmony worked, which reflected on the song compositions. Hetfield developed more socially aware lyrics, as well as ominous and semi-philosophical references. Ulrich explained that Metallica opted not to rely strictly on fast tempos as on the previous album, but to explore other musical approaches that sounded powerful and heavy. Grinder magazine's Kevin Fisher summarized the album as [...] "ultimate thrash, destruction and total blur" [...] <b>that</b> <b>reminded</b> him of the speed and power of Kill 'Em All. Music journalist Martin Popoff observed that Ride the Lightning offered [...] "sophistication and brutality in equal measure" [...] and was seen as something new {{at the time of}} its release. Discussing the album's lyrical content, philosopher William Irwin wrote: [...] "After Kill 'Em All, the rebellion and aggression became much more focused as the enemy became more clearly defined. Metallica was deeply concerned about various domains in which the common man was wrongfully yet ingeniously deceived. More precisely, they were highly critical of those in power".|$|E
