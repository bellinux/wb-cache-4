5|$|The {{veterinary}} uses of clindamycin {{are quite}} similar to its human indications, and include treatment of osteomyelitis, skin infections, and <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> {{for which it is}} the preferred drug in dogs and cats. <b>Toxoplasmosis</b> rarely causes symptoms in cats, but can do so in very young or immunocompromised kittens and cats.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin {{may also}} be used to treat <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> and, in {{combination}} with primaquine, is effective in treating mild to moderate Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Stage IV or AIDS: severe {{symptoms}} {{which include}} <b>toxoplasmosis</b> of the brain, candidiasis of the esophagus, trachea, bronchi or lungs and Kaposi's sarcoma. A CD4 count {{of less than}} 200/µl.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted {{woodpeckers}} are hunted by woodland {{birds of}} prey such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk and the northern goshawk. This woodpecker is a host of the blood-feeding fly Carnus hemapterus, and its internal parasites may include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transversus. Protozoans also occur, including the potentially fatal Toxoplasma gondii, which causes <b>toxoplasmosis.</b> The great spotted woodpecker is the favoured host of the tapeworm Anomotaenia brevis.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} animals. Pathogenic bacteria cause diseases such as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax. Protozoa cause diseases including malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and <b>toxoplasmosis.</b> Microscopic fungi cause diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis and histoplasmosis. Pathogenic viruses cause diseases such as influenza, yellow fever and AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Doctors {{were the}} first to deal with the toll that AIDS would take in the United States. Some—like Marcus Conant, James Curran, Arye Rubenstein, Michael S. Gottlieb, and Mathilde Krim—would also realize their {{professional}} life's courses in dealing with patient after patient who showed up in their offices with baffling illnesses, most notably lymphadenopathy, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Kaposi's Sarcoma, <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> cytomegalovirus, cryptosporidia, and other opportunistic infections that caused death by a grisly combination of ailments overtaxing a compromised immune system. With no information on how the disease was spread, hospital staff were often reluctant to handle AIDS patients, and Shilts reported that some medical personnel refused to treat them at all.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are also}} {{significant}} vectors of disease. The black rat, with the fleas that it carries, plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague, and carries the organisms responsible for typhus, Weil's disease, <b>toxoplasmosis</b> and trichinosis. A number of rodents carry hantaviruses, including the Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses, which can infect humans. Rodents {{also help to}} transmit diseases including babesiosis, cutaneous leishmaniasis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Powassan virus, rickettsialpox, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and West Nile virus.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species may}} be in risk of {{extinction}} even without complete deforestation, such as ruffed lemurs, which {{are very sensitive to}} habitat disturbance. If large fruit trees are removed, the forest may sustain fewer individuals of a species and their reproductive success may be affected for years. Small populations may be able to persist in isolated forest fragments for 20 to 40years due to long generation times, but in the long term, such populations may not be viable. Small, isolated populations also risk extirpation by natural disasters and disease outbreaks (epizootics). Two diseases that are lethal to lemurs and could severely impact isolated lemur populations are <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> which is spread by feral cats, and the herpes simplex virus carried by humans.|$|E
5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for <b>toxoplasmosis</b> and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as <b>toxoplasmosis</b> and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the disease.|$|E
25|$|Cautions {{that were}} noted include that the {{antibody}} tests do not detect <b>toxoplasmosis</b> directly, {{most people with}} schizophrenia do not have antibodies for <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> and publication bias might exist.|$|E
25|$|<b>Toxoplasmosis</b> is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii. Infections with <b>toxoplasmosis</b> usually cause no obvious symptoms in adults. Occasionally {{there may be}} a few weeks or months of mild flu-like illness such as muscle aches and tender lymph nodes. In a small number of people, eye problems may develop. In those with a weak immune system, severe symptoms such as seizures and poor coordination may occur. If infected during pregnancy, a condition known as congenital <b>toxoplasmosis</b> may affect the child.|$|E
25|$|Other {{conditions}} include neurosyphilis, <b>toxoplasmosis</b> and Refsum's disease.|$|E
25|$|Ingesting {{food that}} has been {{contaminated}} with listeriosis, <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> and salmonella is {{associated with an increased}} risk of miscarriage.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to a correlation with psychological disorders such as OCD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, T. gondii {{can also lead to}} infected people having a higher risk of being in a car accident than uninfected individuals. A study in the Czech Republic found that latent <b>toxoplasmosis</b> patients were involved in accidents 2.65 times more often than people without <b>toxoplasmosis</b> infection. The risk also increased with significantly higher amounts of T. gondii antibodies in the host cells.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonamides are {{contraindicated}} {{in infants}} less than 2 months old (exception when used with pyrimethamine in treating <b>toxoplasmosis)</b> as they increase unconjugated bilirubin leading to kernicterus.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{negative}} association between an infection with the parasite T. gondii and multiple sclerosis, therefore, researchers have concluded that <b>toxoplasmosis</b> infection {{could be considered a}} protective factor.|$|E
25|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests latent infection may subtly influence {{a range of}} human behaviors and tendencies, and infection may alter the susceptibility to or intensity {{of a number of}} affective, psychiatric, or neurological disorders. Research has linked <b>toxoplasmosis</b> with schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|Patients with retinal tears may {{experience}} floaters if {{red blood cells}} are released from leaky blood vessels, and those with uveitis or vitritis, as in <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> {{may experience}} multiple floaters and decreased vision due to the accumulation of white blood cells in the vitreous humour.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{forty percent}} of homes {{have at least one}} cat. Some {{contagious}} infections such as campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis cause visible symptoms of the disease in cats. Other infections, such as cat scratch disease and <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> have no visible symptoms and are carried by apparently healthy cats.|$|E
25|$|A seven-year-old female named Jin Yi died in 2014 in a zoo in Zhengzhou, China, after showing {{symptoms}} of gastroenteritis and respiratory disease. It {{was found that}} {{the cause of death was}} <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> a disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii and infecting most warm-blooded animals, including humans.|$|E
25|$|The {{onset of}} Wain's {{schizophrenia}} {{may have been}} precipitated by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite which is excreted by cats in their feces. The theory that <b>toxoplasmosis</b> can trigger schizophrenia {{is the subject of}} ongoing research, though the origins of the theory can be traced back as early as 1953.|$|E
25|$|Feral cats, as {{with all}} cats, are {{susceptible}} to diseases and infections including rabies, bartonellosis, <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> plague, parasites, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline leukemia virus (FeLV), rickettsial diseases, and feline respiratory disease complex (FRDC, a group of respiratory illnesses including feline herpesvirus type 1, feline calicivirus, Chlamydia felis, and Mycoplasma felis).|$|E
25|$|This {{species can}} {{also serve as}} a {{reservoir}} for Toxoplasma gondii, the parasite that causes <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> though the disease usually spreads from rats to humans when domestic cats feed on infected brown rats. The parasite has a long history with the brown rat, and there are indications that the parasite has evolved to alter an infected rat's perception to cat predation, making it more susceptible to predation and increasing the likelihood of transmission.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{infectious}} diseases can be transmitted either congenitally (before or at birth), and can cause serious neurodevelopmental problems, as for example the viruses HSV, CMV, rubella (congenital rubella syndrome), Zika virus, or bacteria like Treponema pallidum in congenital syphilis, which may progress to neurosyphilis if it remains untreated. Protozoa like Plasmodium or Toxoplasma which can cause congenital <b>toxoplasmosis</b> with multiple cysts {{in the brain and}} other organs, leading to a variety of neurological deficits.|$|E
25|$|Coprophagia is the {{ingestion}} by a dog of feces, either its own {{or those}} of another dog or animal. It {{can be caused by}} medical conditions such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, overfeeding, or malabsorption. It can also be a behavioral problem characterized by attention-seeking, reinforcement, or as a learned behavior. Numerous health problems can arise from this activity, including internal parasites or infection with canine parvovirus or <b>toxoplasmosis.</b> Treatment includes behavioral modification therapy or altering the feces to affect its taste.|$|E
25|$|<b>Toxoplasmosis</b> {{is usually}} spread by eating poorly cooked food that {{contains}} cysts, exposure to infected cat feces, {{and from a}} mother to a child during pregnancy if the mother becomes infected. Rarely the disease may be spread by blood transfusion. It is not otherwise spread between people. The parasite is only known to reproduce sexually in the cat family. However, it can infect most types of warm-blooded animals, including humans. Diagnosis is typically by testing blood for antibodies or by testing amniotic fluid for the parasite's DNA.|$|E
25|$|After Tommy dies from AIDS-related <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> {{the three}} travel back to Scotland to attend his funeral. They meet Spud, {{who has been}} {{released}} from prison. Sick Boy suggests a lucrative heroin transaction, but needs Renton to supply half of the initial £4,000 (£ today). Renton injects himself with a sample to test the heroin's purity and the four sell the heroin to a dealer in London for £16,000 (£ today). During their celebration at a pub, Renton secretly suggests to Spud that they steal the money, but Spud is too scared of Begbie to consider it.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{suggested}} that subtle behavioral or personality changes may occur in infected humans, and infection with the parasite has recently been associated with a number of neurological disorders, particularly schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. A 2015 study also found cognitive deficits in adults to be associated with joint infection by both T. gondii and Helicobacter pylori in a regression model with controls for race-ethnicity and educational attainment. Although a causal relationship between latent <b>toxoplasmosis</b> with these neurological phenomena has not yet been established, preliminary evidence suggests that T. gondii infection can induce some of the same alterations in the human brain as those observed in mice.|$|E
25|$|Pathogens can {{suppress}} amygdala activity. Rats {{infected with}} the <b>toxoplasmosis</b> parasite become less fearful of cats, sometimes even seeking out their urine-marked areas. This behavior often leads to them being eaten by cats. The parasite then reproduces within {{the body of the}} cat. There is evidence that the parasite concentrates itself in the amygdala of infected rats. In a separate experiment, rats with lesions in the amygdala did not express fear or anxiety towards unwanted stimuli. These rats pulled on levers supplying food that sometimes sent out electrical shocks. While they learned to avoid pressing on them, they did not distance themselves from these shock-inducing levers.|$|E
25|$|Cerebral palsy {{is caused}} by {{abnormal}} development or damage to {{the parts of the}} brain that control movement, balance and posture. Most often the problems occur during pregnancy; however, they may also occur during childbirth, or shortly after birth. Often the cause is unknown. Risk factors include preterm birth, being a twin, certain infections during pregnancy such as <b>toxoplasmosis</b> or rubella, exposure to methylmercury during pregnancy, a difficult delivery, and head trauma during {{the first few years of}} life, among others. About 2% of cases are believed to be due to an inherited genetic cause. A number of sub-types are classified based on the specific problems present. For example, those with stiff muscles have spastic cerebral palsy, those with poor coordination have ataxic cerebral palsy, and those with writhing movements have athetoid cerebral palsy. Diagnosis is based on the child's development over time. Blood tests and medical imaging may be used to rule out other possible causes.|$|E
25|$|In most of {{the current}} studies where {{positive}} correlations have been found between T. gondii antibody titers and certain behavioral traits or neurological disorders, T. gondii seropositivity tests are conducted after {{the onset of the}} examined disease or behavioral trait; that is, it is often unclear whether infection with the parasite increases the chances of having a certain trait or disorder, or if having a certain trait or disorder increases the chances of becoming infected with the parasite. Groups of individuals with certain behavioral traits or neurological disorders may share certain behavioral tendencies that increase the likelihood of exposure to and infection with T. gondii; as a result, it is difficult to confirm causal relationships between T. gondii infections and associated neurological disorders or behavioral traits. Provided there is in fact a causal link between T. gondii and schizophrenia, studies have yet to determine why some individuals with latent <b>toxoplasmosis</b> develop schizophrenia while others do not, however, some plausible explanations include differing genetic susceptibility, parasite strain differences, and differences in the route of the acquired T. gondii infection.|$|E
25|$|Up {{to half of}} the world's {{population}} is infected by <b>toxoplasmosis</b> but have no symptoms.G9a {{appears to be a}} critical control point for epigenetic regulation in NAc, as we know it functions in two negative feedback loops. It opposes the induction of ΔFosB, a long-lasting transcription factor important for drug addiction (Robison and Nestler, 2011), while ΔFosB in turn suppresses G9a expression (Maze et al., 2010; Sun et al., 2012a).... Also, G9a is induced in NAc upon prolonged HDAC inhibition, which explains the paradoxical attenuation of cocaine's behavioral effects seen under these conditions, as noted above (Kennedy et al., 2013). GABAA receptor subunit genes are among those that are controlled by this feedback loop. Thus, chronic cocaine, or prolonged HDAC inhibition, induces several GABAA receptor subunits in NAc, which is associated with increased frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In striking contrast, combined exposure to cocaine and HDAC inhibition, which triggers the induction of G9a and increased global levels of H3K9me2, leads to blockade of GABAA receptor and IPSC regulation.}} Widespread histone–lysine acetylation in cortical astrocytes appears to be another epigenetic mechanism employed by T. gondii.|$|E
25|$|The blood–brain barrier acts very {{effectively}} {{to protect the}} brain from most pathogens. Thus, blood-borne infections of the brain are very rare. Infections {{of the brain that}} do occur are often very serious and difficult to treat. Antibodies are too large to cross the blood–brain barrier, and only certain antibiotics are able to pass. In some cases, a drug has to be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it can enter the brain by crossing the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier. However, not all drugs that are delivered directly to the CSF can effectively penetrate the CSF barrier and enter the brain. The blood–brain barrier becomes more permeable during inflammation. This allows some antibiotics and phagocytes to move across the BBB. However, this also allows bacteria and viruses to infiltrate the BBB. Examples of pathogens that can traverse the BBB and the diseases they cause include toxoplasma gondii which causes <b>toxoplasmosis,</b> spirochetes like Borrelia which causes Lyme disease, Group B streptococci which causes meningitis in newborns, and Treponema pallidum which causes syphilis. Some of these harmful bacteria gain access by releasing cytotoxins like pneumolysin which have a direct toxic effect on brain microvascular endothelium and tight junctions.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} before, {{these results}} of increased proportions of people seropositive for the parasite {{in cases of}} these neurological disorders do not necessarily indicate a causal relationship between the infection and disorder. It {{is also important to}} mention that in 2016 a population-representative birth cohort study which was done, to test a hypothesis that <b>toxoplasmosis</b> is related to impairment in brain and behaviour measured by a range of phenotypes including neuropsychiatric disorders, poor impulse control, personality and neurocognitive deficits. The results of this study did not support the results in the previously mentioned studies, more than marginally. None of the P-values showed significance for any outcome measure. Thus, according to this study, the presence of T. gondii antibodies is not correlated to increase susceptibility to any of the behaviour phenotypes (except possibly to a higher rate of unsuccessful attempted suicide). This team did not observe any significant association between T. gondii serpositivity and schizophrenia. The team notes that the null findings might be a false negative due to low statistical power because of small sample sizes, but against this weights that their set-up should avoid some possibilities for errors in the about 40 studies that did show a positive correlation. They conclude that further studies should be performed.|$|E
