Rheumatologist Fatima Haji, for example, appeared on Al Jazeera television news in a [...] "hysterical" [...] state, describing Isa Abdul Hasan, a man in his 60s who died in her hospital of a head wound he had received from police: [...] "I just started shouting: 'What <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>did</b> this guy do, he was an old man.

[...] While McClure's delayed giving him an answer on his novel, they offered him an assignment writing about the Pennsylvania coal mines. [...] "In the Depths of a Coal Mine", a story with pictures by Linson, was syndicated by McClure's {{in a number of}} newspapers, heavily edited. [...] Crane was reportedly disgusted by the cuts, asking Linson: [...] "Why <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>did</b> they send me up there then? Do they want the public to think the coal mines gilded ball-rooms with the miners eating ice-cream in boiled shirt-fronts?" ...|$|E
500|$|Results May Vary was {{released}} on September 23, 2003, and received largely unfavorable reviews. Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine panned the album, writing, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>did</b> he ever get to put this mess out?" [...] The Guardian reviewer Caroline Sullivan wrote, [...] "At least Limp Bizkit can't be accused of festering in the rap-rock ghetto [...] But Durst's problems are ever-present – and does anybody still care?" [...] Despite criticisms of the album, it was a commercial success, peaking at No.3 on the Billboard 200.|$|E

500|$|As {{they worked}} with Steinbeck, Rodgers and Hammerstein, though renowned for such hits as Oklahoma!, Carousel, and South Pacific, {{suffered}} a relative failure with the 1953 musical Me and Juliet, {{a tale of}} romance among the cast and stagehands backstage at a musical. Before agreeing to do the Sweet Thursday project, the duo had considered other projects for their next work together, such as an adaptation of the film Saratoga Trunk. A proposal made by attorney David Merrick to adapt a series of works by Marcel Pagnol to which Merrick held the stage rights fell through when the duo were not willing to have Merrick be an associate producer; Merrick took the project elsewhere, and it was developed into the hit Fanny. Afterwards, Hammerstein stated, [...] "Why <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>did</b> we give up Fanny? What on earth were we trying to prove?

500|$|On the bridge, Beyoncé sings {{about having}} drunken {{sex in the}} kitchen: [...] "We {{woke up in the}} kitchen saying / How <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>did</b> this shit happen / Oh baby, drunk in love, we be all night / Last thing I {{remember}} is our beautiful bodies grinding off in that club". The second verse of the song is half-rapped by her. Jay-Z later appears to provide his rapped verse as he compares his relationship with Beyoncé to that of Ike and Tina Turner. He forgoes subtlety as he raps, [...] "Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol/ Slid the panties right to the side/ Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight... your breasteses is my breakfast". Similarly to Beyoncé, Jay-Z sings about the places they have had sex in their house. During his lines, he raps about [...] "reppin' that Third", a reference to the Third Ward area located in Houston.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of Results May Vary was mainly negative. The album received [...] "generally unfavorable reviews" [...] on Metacritic, {{with a score}} of 33 out of 100. This is the second lowest score on Metacritic, above only Kevin Federline's album Playing with Fire. According to AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, [...] "the music has no melody, hooks, or energy, [...] all {{attention is focused on}} the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front, and long before the record is over, you're left wondering, how <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>did</b> he ever get to put this mess out?". In a review of Limp Bizkit's Greatest Hitz compilation, Erlewine called [...] "Behind Blue Eyes" [...] the worst in the band's [...] "never-ending series of embarrassing covers". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Durst's problems are ever-present - and does anybody still care?". Stylus criticized Results May Vary, calling it [...] "an album that {{can only be described as}} abysmal". Rob O'Connor of Yahoo! Launch also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "No, Fred, the results don't vary. The results are consistent throughout your new album—consistently crappy." [...] Kitty Empire of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Limp Bizkit have decided to expose their tender side. They really shouldn't have bothered [...] having seen Limp Bizkit's 'other side', you want the old, unapologetic, meathead version back". Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also criticized Results May Vary: [...] "Results May Vary has a few highlights — 'Almost Over' (very Everlast) and 'Phenomenon' (very Primus) — but way too few to justify all the time and energy spent".|$|E

2500|$|Waltrip's {{first season}} with Junior Johnson was a huge success. He won 12 races {{including}} big races such as the Southern 500, the Food City 500, and the Riverside 400 event. He almost set a win record at Talladega for his 1981 season (winning the big races) by nearly winning the Talladega 500. On the final lap rookie Ron Bouchard dove under Waltrip and Terry Labonte to take the lead. Bouchard beat Waltrip by a foot in a 3-wide drag race {{in what has been}} called the biggest upset in NASCAR history. Waltrip reportedly said [...] "Where <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>did</b> he come from?" [...] in an interview. Waltrip also stated in a post-race conference that part of the reason he lost the race was because he thought Bouchard was a lap down and therefore did not block Bouchard.|$|E
2500|$|At Kentucky, Earnhardt Jr. {{struggled}} with overheated brakes, and even caused a caution when he brushed the outside wall in turns 3 and 4 {{halfway through the}} race. Later, on lap 206, {{he would be the}} subject of controversy when he rear-ended Danica Patrick and spun her out, in part because of his faulty brakes. Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what am I supposed to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner. I know better than to run into her because it gets so much attention. There wasn't nothing I could do. I mean, as hard as I hit her, what <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>did</b> she think I was doing?
