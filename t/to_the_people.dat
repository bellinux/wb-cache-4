Scullin also criticised {{the government for the}} growing debt problem and economic malaise, which for some years he had predicted would lead to a major economic crisis.|$|E

5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict, as {{described}} within the papyrus upon {{which part of}} the edict was inscribed, was to appease the gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy.

The damnatio memoriae against Geta and the large payments Caracalla had made to his own supporters were designed to protect himself from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded, Caracalla felt the need to repay the gods of Rome by returning the favour <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> of Rome through a similarly grand gesture. This was done through the granting of citizenship.|$|E
