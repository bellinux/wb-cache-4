5|$|A {{low-level}} circulation {{formed from}} the frontal cloud band on September 26 about 460miles (740km) east of central Florida. Dean was first identified {{on the afternoon}} of September 26 as a subtropical storm. An Air Force reconnaissance flight was sent <b>to</b> <b>Dean</b> on September 27 and only reported winds of 35mph (55km/h) at 23miles (37kilometres) from the center. A pressure of 999millibars (29.50inHg) indicated that Dean was strengthening as it headed northward. Additionally, satellite pictures showed that the subtropical cyclone was emerging from the cloud. This data also showed that the storm was gaining tropical characteristics and was given the name Dean {{on the afternoon of}} September 27.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} part of the 12th century, the manor passed from the second Baron of Dunham Massey to Matthew de Bromale. According <b>to</b> <b>Dean,</b> Matthew's father is said to have founded the de Bromale family, naming himself after the manor, and he may have been related to or a {{follower}} of the de Masseys. He may have also held the manor at some point. The de Bromales held the manor until 1370 when Alice de Bromale married John de Davenport, and the family name was changed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, Snedden created {{a plan to}} let the paper's {{employees}} buy the company and keep ownership local. This plan was under way {{at the time of}} Snedden's death in 1989, but by 1992, many of the paper's employees were nearing retirement age. This factor, and the need for costly upgrades to expand the paper onto the Internet, led to a decision to sell the News-Miner <b>to</b> <b>Dean</b> Singleton and Richard Scudder, co-founders of the MediaNews Group newspaper chain. In order to preserve the paper's independence—something desired by Snedden—the News-Miner was purchased by the family trusts of the two men, with ownership split 50/50 between the two trusts.|$|E
5|$|Some {{sources have}} {{suggested}} that the opera was performed in Dublin in March or April 1711, though according <b>to</b> <b>Dean</b> and Knapp there is no record of such an occasion. In November 1715 a version mainly in German was performed in Hamburg. This production, based on a translation by the playwright Barthold Feind, proved to be very popular and was revived in the city on numerous occasions during the 1720s. A pastiche of the opera, with additional numbers by Leonardo Leo, was presented by Leo at the Royal Court in Naples in 1718, with Nicolini singing his original role.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland's first {{preseason game}} {{was a victory}} over the Bills in Akron. The Browns scored three touchdowns in the first quarter, first on an {{interception}} return by Cliff Lewis and then {{on a pair of}} passes from quarterback Otto Graham <b>to</b> <b>Dean</b> Sensanbaugher and Mac Speedie. Sensanbaugher scored another touchdown in the second quarter on a pass from Lewis, who came in to substitute for Graham. By the time fullback Marion Motley ran for a short touchdown in the third quarter to make the score 35–0, coach Paul Brown had pulled most of the team's starters. Buffalo proceeded to mount a comeback, scoring one touchdown in the third quarter and two in the fourth. Buffalo's final score came on a punt return received by Rex Bumgardner. As he was about to be tackled at the Cleveland 20-yard line, Bumgardner pitched the ball to teammate Bill Heywood, who ran {{the rest of the way}} for the touchdown. Cleveland and Buffalo both had 12 first downs and 206 yards of rushing, but the Browns had 159 yards of passing to Buffalo's 127, helping secure the 35–21 win.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of SummerSlam, he and other Superstars were being interviewed and spoke out against Triple H when Triple H cost Daniel Bryan the championship. This led to him, alongside other superstars who spoke out against Triple H to feud against Triple H's newly formed Authority. Ziggler was later unsuccessful in capturing the United States Championship, when he lost <b>to</b> <b>Dean</b> Ambrose, at Night of Champions and on the October 16 episode of Main Event. Ziggler also failed to win the Intercontinental Championship from Curtis Axel on the November 11 episode of Raw. In December, Ziggler lost two number one contender matches for the Intercontinental Championship, first to Damien Sandow and later to Fandango.

5|$|In late 1971, John Dean, the White House Counsel, {{pushed to}} expand the {{existing}} intelligence program ahead of the 1972 re-election campaign. Dean delegated the task to Jack Caulfield, {{a member of his}} staff who was a former New York police officer. According <b>to</b> <b>Dean,</b> Caulfield himself was interested in work outside of politics; he intended to create a private security company, and felt that if the Nixon cabinet were an early client, it would lead to lucrative future clients within the private sector. Fred Emery, a journalist for The Times and BBC, refutes this, claiming in his book Watergate: The Corruption & Fall of Richard Nixon that the idea of a private sector security firm was simply a front for a committed campaign of surveillance working Nixon and the Republican Party, with political donations to the re-election campaign able to be diverted through the company as though they were unrelated transactions.|$|E

5|$|The Davenports {{held the}} manor for around 500 years, {{and it is}} likely that they built the current house after their accession. The first William Davenport was lord of the manor from 1478 to 1528, {{and one of the first}} {{recorded}} trustees of Macclesfield Grammar School. It is possible that he was heavily involved in the final battle of the Wars of the Roses at Bosworth and thereby instrumental in gaining the crown for Henry VII, who rewarded him with a pension of 20 marks per year payable for his lifetime. According <b>to</b> <b>Dean,</b> it was during this first William's tenure that Bramall may have been vandalised by a man named Randle Hassall, who destroyed all or part of nine houses and stole the timber. This gives credence to the theory that Bramall was rebuilt, replacing or partially replacing an older building.|$|E
