25|$|Further Swiss {{legislation}} mandates {{a stop to}} {{road building}} in the Alps and a shift in transportation policy (Article on the Protection of the Alps, initiated by a popular initiative and surprisingly accepted by the public in 1994), the transfer of as many goods as possible from transalpine <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>road</b> to transport by train and the setting of a Transfer Goal, a maximum number of trucks to cross the Alps by road (Traffic Transfer Act, adopted 1998). These goals however can only be accomplished with a fully functional NRLA rail link.|$|E

One of the key elements of the GTP was a heavy investment into the transportation infrastructure, in particular railroads. In 2011, the Ethiopian Railway Corporation (ERC) awarded contracts to two Chinese state-owned companies {{for the construction of a}} new and electrified standard gauge railway from Addis Ababa to the Djibouti border. The railway is expected to reduce cargo transit times from three days by road to twelve hours by train and to reduce cargo transport costs to a third compared to the <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>road.</b> The new line was built by two Chinese state-owned enterprises, the China Railway Group (CREC) and the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CRCC).|$|E
