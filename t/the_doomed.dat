5|$|A {{year after}} her wedding, the Second Sino-Japanese War erupted. The Imperial Japanese Army {{attacked}} Shanghai in August 1937, {{and the national}} capital Nanking in December. Tang's older brother, General Tang Shengzhi, was the chief commander of <b>the</b> <b>doomed</b> defense of Nanking, {{which resulted in the}} Nanking Massacre. Tang Shengming, meanwhile, was the deputy commander of Changsha and chief commander of Changde, both in Hunan province.|$|E
5|$|By March 1942, the Japanese {{invasion}} of the Philippines had compelled MacArthur to withdraw his forces on Luzon to Bataan, while his headquarters and {{his family moved to}} Corregidor. <b>The</b> <b>doomed</b> defense of Bataan captured the imagination of the American public. At a time when the news from all fronts was uniformly bad, MacArthur became a living symbol of Allied resistance to the Japanese.|$|E

During the course of the game, he teams up with civilian survivor Claire Redfield, rescues the young Sherry Birkin, and is aided by the mysterious Ada Wong.

5000|$|General Zahl {{appears in}} the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode [...] "The Last Patrol!" [...] voiced by Corey Burton. In a {{documentary}} about <b>the</b> <b>Doom</b> Patrol, it is mentioned that he fought <b>the</b> <b>Doom</b> Patrol in France with his defeat being the last time anyone has seen <b>the</b> <b>Doom</b> Patrol. Years later, General Zahl assembles Brain, Monsieur Mallah, Animal-Vegetable-Mineral Man, Mutant Master, and Arsenal into targeting <b>the</b> <b>Doom</b> Patrol members. After Arsenal was defeated, General Zahl arrived in a ship and attacked Batman and <b>the</b> <b>Doom</b> Patrol with knock-out gas. Some minutes later on General Zahl's ship, General Zahl had Chief mention the real reason why <b>the</b> <b>Doom</b> Patrol broke up. It turned out that back in <b>the</b> <b>Doom</b> Patrol's last fight with General Zahl in France, General Zahl held a woman at gunpoint. Though General Zahl was defeated, the woman was killed. Now General Zahl reveals that he had planted two detonators on two nearby islands with <b>the</b> <b>Doom</b> Patrol deciding on which island to save with the choice being televised around the world. When Batman breaks free enough for <b>the</b> <b>Doom</b> Patrol to escape, General Zahl assembles the villains he had gathered. When General Zahl mentions that the actual detonator control is on his hat and activates it, <b>the</b> <b>Doom</b> Patrol {{are caught in the}} explosion while Batman used a knock-out gas on the other villains. General Zahl even mourned <b>the</b> <b>Doom</b> Patrol's sacrifice (namely because he failed to reveal them as [...] "frauds" [...] and making the world love them even more, thus disappointing him). General Zahl and the other villains are later arrested by the authorities.|$|R

5|$|Later that year, Toei {{released}} a 143-minute movie, Yamato, {{based on a}} book by Jun Henmi, to commemorate the 60th anniversary {{of the end of}} World War II; Tamiya released special editions of scale models of the battleship in conjunction with the film's release. Based on a book of the same name, the film is a tale about the sailors aboard <b>the</b> <b>doomed</b> battleship and the concepts of honour and duty. The film was shown on more than 290screens across the country and was a commercial success, taking in a record 5.11billion yen at the domestic box office.|$|E
5|$|Samus {{intercepts}} a {{distress signal}} from the Space Pirate frigate Orpheon, whose crew have been slaughtered by the Pirates' own genetically modified, experimental subjects. At the ship's core, she battles with the Parasite Queena giant version of the tiny parasites aboard the ship. The Parasite Queen is defeated and falls into the ship's reactor core, initiating {{the destruction of the}} ship. While Samus is escaping from <b>the</b> <b>doomed</b> frigate, she encounters a cybernetic version of Ridley called Meta-Ridley. During her escape, an electrical surge and explosion damages her power suit, which revert to her original Power Suit. Samus escapes the frigate and chases her nemesis in her gunship towards the nearby planet Tallon IV.|$|E
5|$|During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907, parties led by Edgeworth David {{became the}} first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole. Douglas Mawson, who assumed the {{leadership}} of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931. In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908– February 1909: they were the first humans to traverse the Ross Ice Shelf, the first to traverse the Transantarctic Mountains (via the Beardmore Glacier), and the first to set foot on the South Polar Plateau. An expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram {{became the first}} to reach the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911, using a route from the Bay of Whales and up the Axel Heiberg Glacier. One month later, <b>the</b> <b>doomed</b> Scott Expedition reached the pole.|$|E

5|$|Mycale and Plataea {{have great}} {{significance}} in ancient {{history as the}} battles which decisively ended the second Persian invasion of Greece, thereby swinging {{the balance of the}} Greco-Persian Wars in favour of the Greeks. The Battle of Salamis saved Greece from immediate conquest, but it was Mycale and Plataea which effectively ended that threat. However, neither of these battles are as well known as Thermopylae, Salamis or Marathon. The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear; it might however be a result of the circumstances in which the battle was fought. The fame of Thermopylae certainly lies in <b>the</b> <b>doomed</b> heroism of the Greeks in the face of overwhelming numbers; Marathon and Salamis perhaps because they were both fought against the odds, and in dire strategic situations. Conversely, the Battles of Plataea and Mycale were both fought from a relative position of Greek strength, and against lesser odds; perhaps the Greeks were even expecting to win and had certainly seen the opportunity to deal the final blow.|$|E
5|$|One {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events in the game, on a floating continent hovering high above the surface of an unnamed planet, a technologically advanced civilization sought to harness the power of the four elemental crystals of light. They did not realize that they could not control such fundamental forces of nature. This power of light would have consumed the world itself had the light crystals not had their natural counterparts: the four dark elemental crystals. Disturbed by the sudden interruption of the careful balance between light and dark, four warriors were granted the power of the dark crystals to recapture the power of the light crystals. These so-called Dark Warriors succeeded in their quest, and restored harmony to the world. But their victory came too late to save <b>the</b> <b>doomed</b> civilization, whose culture was reduced to ruin, though their floating continent remained. On that continent, the circle of Gulgans, a race of blind soothsayers and fortune-tellers, predicted that these events will ultimately repeat.|$|E
5|$|The book is {{a fictional}} autobiography, {{describing}} the life of Maximilien Aue, a former officer in the SS who, decades later, {{tells the story of}} a crucial part of his life when he was an active member of the security forces of the Third Reich. Aue begins his narrative as a member of an Einsatzgruppe in 1941, before being sent to <b>the</b> <b>doomed</b> German forces locked in the Battle of Stalingrad, which he survives. After a convalescence period in Berlin, and a visit to occupied France, he is designated for an advisory role for the concentration camps, and visits the extermination camps. He is ultimately present during the 1945 Battle of Berlin, the Nazi regime's last stand. By the end of the story, he flees Germany under a false French identity to start a new life in northern France. Throughout the account, Aue meets several famous Nazis, including Adolf Eichmann, Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Hitler. In the book, Aue accepts responsibility for his actions, but most of the time he feels more like an observer than a direct participant.|$|E

5|$|The {{county has}} a long history of human {{settlement}} stretching back to the Neolithic era. The Romans conquered Dorset's indigenous Celtic tribe, and during the early Middle Ages, the Saxons settled the area and made Dorset a shire in the 7th century. The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century, and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in 1348. Dorset has seen much civil unrest: in the English Civil War, an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell's forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury; <b>the</b> <b>doomed</b> Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis; and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement. During the Second World War, Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy, and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points. The former was the sailing venue in the 2012 Summer Olympics, and both have clubs or hire venues for sailing, Cornish pilot gig rowing, sea kayaking and powerboating.|$|E
5|$|Plataea and Mycale {{have great}} {{significance}} in ancient {{history as the}} battles that decisively ended the second Persian invasion of Greece, thereby swinging {{the balance of the}} Greco-Persian Wars in favour of the Greeks. They kept Persia from conquering all of Greece, although they paid a high price by losing many of their men. The Battle of Marathon showed that the Persians could be defeated, and the Battle of Salamis saved Greece from immediate conquest, but it was Plataea and Mycale that effectively ended that threat. However, neither of these battles is nearly as well known as Thermopylae, Salamis or Marathon. The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear; it might, however, be a result of the circumstances in which the battle was fought.

5|$|The next day, a Nazi U-boat appears and {{intercepts}} the ship. Belloq and Dietrich {{seize the}} Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels {{with them to}} {{an island in the}} Aegean Sea. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to Hitler. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with a panzerfaust, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact. The Nazis take Indy and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Belloq performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark, which appears to contain nothing but sand, all that remains of the Ten Commandments. Suddenly, angelic ghost-like beings emerge from the Ark. Indy cautions Marion to keep her eyes closed and not to observe what happens next. Belloq and the others look on in astonishment as the apparitions are suddenly revealed to be angels of death. A vortex of flame forms above the Ark and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all. As Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror, the Ark turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes. Flames then engulf the remains of <b>the</b> <b>doomed</b> assembly, save for Indy and Marion, and the pillar of fire rises into the sky. The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before dropping back down onto the Ark and sealing it. Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.|$|E
