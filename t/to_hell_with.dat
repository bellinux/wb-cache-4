500|$|Lee's screen debut was in The Double Event in 1934, {{followed}} by a role as Cartwright in Berthold Viertel's Rhodes of Africa (1936), a biopic of Cecil Rhodes, in which he starred alongside Walter Huston, Oskar Homolka, and Basil Sydney. Terence Pettigrew mentions a [...] "witty scene" [...] featuring Bernard Lee in the film {{in which he is}} [...] "struggling to put on a tight collar prior to slipping into town for a few ales." [...] Although Lee was in wartime service in the army between 1940 and 1946, he had managed to act in several films earlier which were released between 1939 and 1943, including Murder in Soho, The Frozen Limits, Let George Do It!

500|$|The social {{research}} organisation Mass-Observation recorded that Formby's first film of 1940, Let George Do It!, gave a particularly strong boost to early-war British civilian morale. In a dream sequence after being drugged, Formby's character parachutes into a Nuremberg Rally and punches Hitler. According to Richards, the scene provided [...] "the visual encapsulation of the people's {{war with the}} English Everyman flooring the Nazi Superman". The scene was so striking that the film became Formby's first international release, in the US, under the title <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>With</b> Hitler, and in Moscow—where it was released in 1943 under the title Dinky Doo—it was shown to packed houses and received record box-office takings for over ten months.

500|$|Soon the Christian metal bands became {{controversial}} {{for their}} beliefs and often evangelistic {{goals in the}} metal music scene, which typically holds individualism in particularly high esteem. Stryper, for instance, although a commercial success at that time, received a hostile reception when they played at a Dutch metal festival in 1985. Regardless of this, Stryper helped to popularize the genre. They were the first Christian band to reach platinum status on an album. The 1986 album <b>To</b> <b>Hell</b> <b>with</b> the Devil sold 2 million copies and achieved a Grammy nomination. The music videos for [...] "Free", [...] "Calling on You", and the power ballad [...] "Honestly" [...] all spent many weeks on Music Television's Top 10, and [...] "Free" [...] was in the No. 1 position for 12 weeks (60 days), May 4 – July 24, 1987.|$|E
500|$|Kemper {{then left}} the scene in Hallett's car, driving eastward, leaving California and through Nevada and Utah. He arrived in Pueblo, Colorado and, after not hearing any news on the radio about the murders {{of his mother and}} Hallett, found a phone booth and called the police. He confessed to the murders of his mother and Hallett, but the police did not take his call seriously and told him to call back at a later time. Several hours later, Kemper called again asking to speak to an officer he {{personally}} knew. Kemper then confessed to that officer of killing his mother and Hallett, and waited in his car for the police to arrive, arrest him and take him into custody, where he then also confessed to the murders of the six students. When asked after his arrest what motivated him to turn himself in, Kemper said: [...] "The original purpose was gone... It wasn't serving any physical or real or emotional purpose. It was just a pure waste of time... Emotionally, I couldn't handle it much longer. Toward the end there, I started feeling the folly of the whole damn thing, and at the point of near exhaustion, near collapse, I just said <b>to</b> <b>hell</b> <b>with</b> it and called it all off." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's bleak lyrics were {{explained}} by Marker as {{a mockery of}} the angsty [...] " [...] thing" [...] themes prevalent in mid-1990s alternative rock songs, as well as a self-deprecating reference to Garbage's own dark lyrics, with Manson explaining that the song was [...] "a dig at ourselves because we like records that don't make us feel very happy, and at this so-called 'alternative' scene of 'we're so weird and more wonderful than everybody else'". Vig added that [...] "'Only Happy When It Rains' was about what happened with grunge and the angst-filled thing which has dominated the American alternative rock scene. With us there's self-deprecation, we have to poke fun at ourselves because we're so incredibly obsessive about the songs and the lyrics, which makes us filled with self-loathing, hurhur." [...] Garbage said they referenced both the title of The Jesus and Mary Chain song [...] "Happy When It Rains" [...] (1987) and Manson's own Scottish psyche. Lyrically, Manson described [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] as [...] "about wanting love but knowing life will always get in the way.... yet not being obliterated by that.

500|$|By late December Welles {{had run out}} {{of money}} and the film was put on hold while he searched for {{additional}} funding. However, some small scenes were shot during the break. Welles later said that he had rejected offers for funding that were conditional upon filming in color. Welles eventually secured funding from Harry Saltzman and production officially resumed in late February with most of Keith Baxter's longer speeches and the Coronation scene in Madrid. Between March and April, Welles finished the film with filler shots, close-ups, the final rejection scene and most of Falstaff's speeches. According to Keith Baxter, Welles had stage fright and delayed all of his scenes until the very end of filming, except for scenes that included other actors. Welles was timid about shooting his love scene with Moreau, and used a double whenever possible. Other filming locations included the Chateau Calatañazor, Puerta de San Vincente and the Soria Cathedral. Welles was harsh with his crew members and according to actor Andrew Faulds, [...] "he spoke in five different languages to them and was pretty offensivevery demanding. I suppose he'd worked out that if you bullied actors, you didn't get the best from them whereas, <b>to</b> <b>hell</b> <b>with</b> the technicians.
