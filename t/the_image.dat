However, during the war <b>the</b> <b>image</b> was strictly internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women to work harder.

5|$|The filters {{designed}} by Campbell were named wave filters {{because of their}} property of passing some waves and strongly rejecting others. The method by which they were designed was called <b>the</b> <b>image</b> parameter method and filters designed to this method are called image filters. <b>The</b> <b>image</b> method essentially consists of developing the transmission constants of an infinite chain of identical filter sections and then terminating the desired finite number of filter sections in <b>the</b> <b>image</b> impedance. This exactly corresponds {{to the way the}} properties of a finite length of transmission line are derived from the theoretical properties of an infinite line, <b>the</b> <b>image</b> impedance corresponding to the characteristic impedance of the line.|$|E
