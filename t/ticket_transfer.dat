50|$|Tickets are {{available}} for a fixed number of trips, regardless of distance traveled or number of transfers. Monthly and yearly passes are also available. Fare enforcement {{takes place at the}} points of entry. Once a passenger has entered the Metro system, there are no further ticket checks - one can ride to any number of stations and make transfers within the system freely. Transfers to other public-transport systems (such as bus, tram, trolleybus) are not covered by the <b>ticket.</b> <b>Transfer</b> to monorail is free within 90 minutes.|$|E
50|$|Sound Transit {{contracted}} with Pierce Transit to operate an interim shuttle bus {{from the initial}} endpoint of Central Link at Tukwila International Blvd Station to SeaTac/Airport Station until the extension to the airport was finished. Pierce Transit was awarded the contract in February 2009, as an expansion of their contract to operate a connector bus between Tacoma Dome Station and Lakewood Station. For the service Pierce Transit placed four 1991 Orion I coaches back into service that had been mothballed for several years. The Link airport connector ran every ten to fifteen minutes from both stops, and riders {{had to have a}} valid <b>ticket,</b> <b>transfer,</b> or pass to ride from Tukwila station to the Airport. This service ended {{at the end of the}} day on December 19, 2009, when direct service to the airport commenced.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, TicketMaster started {{adoption}} of a [...] "paperless" [...] restricted ticketing, in which tickets could not be resold. Under this system, customers prove their purchase by showing a credit card and ID. The measure was taken in response to ticket scalping and resale markup of tickets on secondary markets and adopted during Miley Cyrus (2009) World Wonder Tour, although Ticketmaster first experimented it with AC/DC's Black Ice World Tour (2008-10). TicketMaster has since changed {{the name of the}} system to [...] "Credit Card Entry". The system requires large groups to enter together with the person who purchased tickets. Some events have <b>Ticket</b> <b>Transfer</b> which allows the tickets to change ownership and allow for tickets to be transferred through Ticketmaster's proprietary systems. These cannot be later resold or transferred via other companies systems such as StubHub.|$|E

5000|$|Within the terminal, {{passengers}} purchase <b>tickets,</b> <b>transfer</b> their luggage, and {{go through}} security. The buildings that provide access to the airplanes (via gates) are typically called concourses. However, the terms [...] "terminal" [...] and [...] "concourse" [...] are sometimes used interchangeably, depending on {{the configuration of the}} airport.|$|R
50|$|Fare Inspectors and Special Constables {{patrol the}} entire transit {{system for the}} safety and {{security}} of passengers and to ensure compliance with the proof-of-payment system.

Customers without valid fares are subject to a warning, an instant fine or a criminal charge.|$|R
40|$|IT problem {{management}} {{calls for}} quick identification of re-solvers to reported problems. The efficiency of this pro-cess highly depends on ticket routing—transferring problem ticket among various expert groups {{in search of}} the right re-solver to the ticket. To achieve efficient ticket routing, wise decision needs to be made at each step of <b>ticket</b> <b>transfer</b> to determine which expert group is likely to be, or the one that can lead to the resolver. In this paper, we address the possibility of improving the efficiency of ticket routing by mining ticket resolution se-quences alone, without accessing ticket content. To demon-strate this possibility, a Markov model is developed to sta-tistically capture the right decisions that have been made toward problem resolution, where the order of the Markov model is carefully chosen according to the conditional en-tropy obtained from ticket data. We also design a search algorithm, called Variable-order Multiple active State search (VMS), that generates <b>ticket</b> <b>transfer</b> recommendations based on our model. The proposed framework is evaluated on a large set of real-world problem tickets. The results demon-strate that VMS significantly improves human decisions: the problem resolver can often be identified with fewer ticket transfers. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-This paper {{studies the}} design and {{performance}} of the Probabilistic Priority (PP) [5] packet scheduling algorithm to schedule packets. Unlike an earlier design that uses fractional arithmetic and prohibits large number of classes, we present an integer PP algorithm and show that PP {{turns out to be}} a special scheme of applying lottery scheduling [10] to bandwidth allocation in a strict priority sense. We then propose a Multiwinner PP (MPP) scheduler using multi-winner lottery scheduling to improve the throughput and response time accuracy and a flexible <b>ticket</b> <b>transfer</b> algorithm to improve the deadline violation probability in probabilistic scheduling. Finally, we investigate the issue of parameter assignment for an MPP scheduler and use our techniques to implement a prototype Assured Forwarding (AF) mechanism. I...|$|E
40|$|Problem {{resolution}} {{is a key}} issue in the IT service industry. A large service provider handles, on daily basis, thousands of tickets that report various types of problems from its customers. The efficiency of this process highly depends on the effective interactions among various expert groups, {{in search of the}} resolver to the reported problem. In fact, <b>ticket</b> <b>transfer</b> decisions reflect the expertise awareness between groups, thus encoding a sophisticated resolution social network. In this paper, we propose a computational framework to quantitatively assess expertise awareness, i. e., how well a group knows the expertise of others. An accurate assessment of expertise awareness could identify the weakest components in a resolution system. The framework, built on our previously developed resolution engine, is able to calculate the performance difference caused by excluding a node from the network. The difference exposes the awareness of this node to other nodes in the network. To our best knowledge, this is the first study on this problem from a computational perspective. We tested the proposed framework on a large set of real-world problem tickets and validated our discovery by carefully analyzing the tickets that are incorrectly transferred. Experimental results show that our framework can successfully capture groups that do not know others ’ expertise very well. 1...|$|E

50|$|Tickets {{are valid}} for 90 minutes. To {{purchase}} on a bus, money is {{dropped into a}} farebox, which accepts only coins.

Although magnetic <b>transfer</b> <b>tickets</b> are valid throughout the system including SkyTrain and SeaBus, fare gates on SkyTrain and SeaBus stations are incapable of reading magnetic <b>transfer</b> <b>tickets</b> and the gate will not open even if the passenger has a valid magnetic <b>transfer</b> <b>ticket.</b>|$|R
