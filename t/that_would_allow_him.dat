5|$|Johnson wanted Humphrey to pick Sanford as {{his running}} mate. On one occasion, the Humphrey {{campaign}} asked Sanford {{if he wanted to}} be the vice presidential candidate. Sanford declined, and Humphrey ultimately picked Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine. Though Sanford received a number of legal and business offers from the private sector during this period, he was interested in a position <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to keep his political prospects open.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, 1893, Fields married Dora McDavid; {{the couple}} had six children. At age 21, he was elected constable of Carter County, but three years later, he fell short in his bid to capture a seat in state legislature. Following the loss, {{he took a job}} at a grocery store in Ashland, Kentucky <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to travel the state more freely, make acquaintances, and better {{position}} himself for a run for higher office.|$|E
5|$|St-Calais was {{the only}} bishop who did not {{actively}} aid the king; the rebelling magnates included Roger de Montgomery Earl of Shrewsbury, Robert de Mowbray Earl of Northumbria, and Odo's brother Robert Count of Mortain. The rebellion had failed {{by the end of}} the summer, but St-Calais continued to hold out in Durham, at first claiming he had never actually rebelled. When the king's army arrived, St-Calais agreed to come out, but only after receiving a safe conduct <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to attend a trial while his men continued to hold the castle. St-Calais's actions suggest that he did rebel, whatever his claims to the contrary and affirmations of his innocence in northern chronicles.|$|E

50|$|In July 2014, Frein told Hornbaker, friends, {{and parents}} {{that he was}} moving to Delaware {{to work at a}} {{chemical}} company.

50|$|Klein {{moved to}} Buda in 1804 {{to become the}} editor at the University of Buda press for the Romanian-language books, hoping <b>that</b> this <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to publish his {{historical}} works, a project which did not become true because of his death just two years later.|$|R
5|$|Having become {{versed in}} Kuba {{language}} and culture, Sheppard took {{a team of}} men {{to the edge of}} Kuba territory in 1892. His original plan was to ask for directions to the next village under the guise of purchasing supplies, but the chief of the village only allowed one of his men to go. Sheppard used a variety of tricks to make his way further into the kingdom, including having a scout follow a group of traders and, most famously, eating so many eggs that the townspeople could no longer supply him and his scout was able {{to gain access to the}} next village to find more eggs. Eventually, however, he encountered villagers <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to go no further. While Sheppard was formulating a plan, the king's son, Prince N'toinzide, arrived and arrested Sheppard and his men for trespassing.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Driberg {{published}} a critical study of Moral Re-armament, which brought him attacks from the {{movement on the}} basis of his homosexuality and communist past. Although he made money from this book, throughout the 1960s he was beset by financial problems. When Reynolds News, which had evolved into the Sunday Citizen, finally folded in 1967, he became fully dependent on his parliamentary salary and casual journalism. He had long considered selling Bradwell Lodge, preferably to the National Trust on a basis <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to continue living there. However, the Trust required the property to be mortgage-free and endowed with a substantial fund to cover future repairs, neither of which terms could be arranged. In the event the house remained unsold until 1971. As the 1970 election approached, Driberg wished to retire from parliament, and asked Wilson to appoint him as ambassador to the Vatican. Wilson refused, citing Driberg's age—at 65 he was beyond the retirement age for senior diplomats. Against his will, but with few other sources of income available to him, Driberg fought the June 1970 General Election. He was returned for Barking with a comfortable though reduced majority; nationally, Wilson's government was defeated by Edward Heath's Conservatives.|$|E
5|$|Most of Fielding's plays {{were written}} in five acts, but The Author's Farce was written in three. The opening {{introduces}} the main character, Harry Luckless, and his attempts to woo Harriot, the daughter of his landlady Mrs. Moneywood. The play begins {{in much the same}} way as Fielding's earlier romance-themed comedies, but quickly becomes a different type of play, mocking the literary and theatrical establishment. Luckless is trying to become a successful writer, but lacks the income <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to concentrate on his writing. Although others try to support him financially, Luckless refuses their help; when his friend, Witmore, pays his rent behind his back, Luckless steals the money from Mrs. Moneywood. In the second act, Luckless seeks assistance to help finish his play, The Pleasures of the Town, but is poorly advised, and the work is rejected by his local theatre. Luckless revises his play and succeeds in finding an alternative venue, leading to the third act, in which the work is performed as a puppet show, with actors taking the place of the puppets.|$|E

50|$|Pietro Borromeo and Gordon Thomas {{attribute}} to Giovanni Borromeo {{the invention of}} a non-existent disease (the K Disease) <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to admit hundreds of Jewish patients.

5|$|On May 5, {{the same}} day that Davis officially {{dissolved}} the Confederate Government in Washington, Georgia, Breckinridge discharged most of the men escorting him, retaining only a small contingent of Kentuckians under the command of his cousin, William Campbell Preston Breckinridge. Feeling honor bound to protect Davis, he attempted to create a diversion <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to escape. The next day, his party encountered a large Federal force; while his cousin negotiated with the force's commander, Breckinridge and a small detachment escaped. Riding southward across Georgia, they reached Milltown (now Lakeland) by May 11 and remained there for a few days. Learning of Davis's capture, he left Milltown with only a military aide, a personal servant, and his son Cabell. On May 15, 1865, in Madison, Florida, he was joined by fellow fugitive John Taylor Wood, who had been a captain in the Confederate Navy. Breckinridge and Wood decided to flee to the Bahamas, but because Cabell was allergic to mosquito bites, Breckinridge told him to surrender to the nearest federal officer.|$|E
5|$|Wilkinson {{was able}} to secure passage of a {{constitutional}} amendment allowing a state lottery. He also helped craft a significant education reform bill {{in response to a}} ruling by the Kentucky Supreme Court that declared the state's entire public school system unconstitutional. Wilkinson's term was plagued by political scandal and an uneasy relationship with the state legislature. He advocated an amendment to the state constitution <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to seek a second consecutive term as governor, but the amendment was defeated in the General Assembly. His wife Martha attempted to succeed him, but withdrew from the campaign amid weak support for her candidacy. Following his term as governor, Wilkinson encountered difficult financial times. In 2001, he was sued by a group of creditors, and during the proceedings, it was revealed that he was operating a Ponzi scheme to keep his businesses afloat. Both he and his wife Martha filed for bankruptcy later that year. In 2002, Wilkinson was hospitalized with arterial blockages. His condition was complicated by a recurrence of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He suffered a stroke on July 4, 2002, and his family withdrew his life support the following day in accordance with his previously-expressed wishes.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{reported}} to No. 1 Depot, RAF Uxbridge {{and two days}} later attended No. 2 Central Medical Board on 13 August. He was certified fit to fly and flew Supermarine Spitfire on 21 August. He moved to Bournemouth to see his brother Gordon who was now a pilot officer in No. 501 Squadron RAF. At Queen Mary's Hospital he was fitted with a new arm. MacLachlan explained to the doctors that he required an arm <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to fly a Hurricane. They designed a limb {{that allowed him to}} operate the throttle while taking the control column and firing button with his right hand. They spent hours studying the cockpit layout. The medical staff produced an arm with four spring-loaded pins, like fingers, which enabled him to use the controls on the port side of the cockpit. They secured his left arm to the levers of the throttle quadrant: throttle, propeller pitch control, supercharger and mixture control. The landing gear controls were located on the right side. The artificial arm had to interact with the control column while the gear was being retracted or lowered. His new arm proved sufficient and in September 1941 he flew as many hours in Hurricanes as possible, though not without incident. On 7 September 1941 he force-landed in darkness during a searchlight co-operation exercise. On 28 September 1941 he nearly collided with a Bristol Blenheim in low-cloud. Nevertheless, he was cleared for operational flying on 15 October.|$|E
50|$|For John Ford's The Long Voyage Home (1940), Toland leaned {{more heavily}} on back-projection to create his deep focus compositions, such as the shot of the island women winging to entice {{the men of the}} SS Glencairn.

25|$|Vice-governor Alberto Weretilneck succeeded Soria as governor. Weretilneck {{considered}} calling new elections, despite {{provisions in}} the Constitution of Río Negro Province <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to complete the remainder of Soria's term.|$|E
25|$|Efforts by Ramos {{supporters}} to gain passage of an amendment <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> {{to run for}} a second term were met with large-scale protests, leading Ramos to declare he would not seek re-election.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the results}} in the {{parliamentary}} elections of 1973 the CODE won {{the majority of the}} Chamber of Deputies, but did not obtain a two-thirds majority (100 deputies) <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to block any constitutional reform and conduct an impeachment against President Allende. This last point was the objective of CODE.|$|R
50|$|One of {{his clients}} was pop star Michael Jackson, who sought zoning variances for his Encino {{district}} estate on Hayvenhurst Avenue <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to add a giraffe to his backyard zoo. Jackson wanted to maintain a seventeen-foot-high fence instead of the legally allowed six feet. He withdrew his request after neighbors objected.|$|R
25|$|Stephenson {{studied at}} Boston University, first specializing in physics, then {{switching}} to geography after he found <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> {{to spend more}} time on the university mainframe.

25|$|Posidonius {{was one of}} {{the first}} to attempt to prove Euclid's fifth {{postulate}} of geometry.

From there, Euclidean geometry could be restructured, placing the fifth postulate among the theorems instead.|$|E
25|$|After {{obtaining a}} B.S. in {{biochemistry}} from the University of Sydney, Massey {{worked as a}} research biochemist for the CSIRO.

25|$|The program {{started with}} a {{disabled}} employee who couldn't drive a sports car because of his physical issue. He developed a new clutch system <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to drive, but needed to test it virtually beforehand, as road testing of such a vital modification would be very dangerous. He was granted free access to CATIA to design his idea, which allowed him to eventually drive a sports car.|$|E

25|$|Sadat {{had also}} pushed forward a {{constitutional}} amendment <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have <b>allowed</b> <b>him</b> to stand for re-election as President more than twice.

25|$|Kidd {{kept the}} French passes of Quedagh Merchant, {{as well as}} the vessel itself. While the passes were at best a dubious defence of his capture, British {{admiralty}} and vice-admiralty courts (especially in North America) heretofore had often winked at privateers' excesses into piracy, and Kidd may have been hoping that the passes would provide the legal fig leaf <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>him</b> to keep Quedagh Merchant and her cargo.
