By 2006, there was a resurgence in demand for turboprop-powered airliners, in part due to the rising price of oil; during this year, Saab announced the largest ever leasing deal for the 340, providing a total of 25 340s to Australian operator Regional Express Airlines.

40|$|Background Although {{lifestyle}} interventions {{have shown}} {{to be effective in}} reducing the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus, maintenance of achieved results is difficult, as participants often experience relapse after the intervention has ended. This paper describes the systematic development of a maintenance programme for the extensive SLIMMER intervention, an existing diabetes prevention intervention for high-risk individuals, implemented in a real-life setting in the Netherlands. Methods <b>The</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> was developed using the Intervention Mapping protocol. Programme development was informed by a literature study supplemented by various focus group discussions and feedback from implementers of the extensive SLIMMER intervention. Results <b>The</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> was designed to sustain a healthy diet and physical activity pattern by targeting knowledge, attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control of the SLIMMER participants. Practical applications were clustered into nine programme components, including sports clinics at local sports clubs, a concluding meeting with the physiotherapist and dietician, and a return session with the physiotherapist, dietician and physical activity group. Manuals were developed for the implementers and included a detailed time table and step-by-step instructions on how to implement <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme.</b> Conclusions The Intervention Mapping protocol provided a useful framework to systematically plan a maintenance programme for the extensive SLIMMER intervention. The study showed that planning a maintenance programme can build on existing implementation structures of the extensive programme.

40|$|Abstract. In <b>the</b> Netherlands <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of bridges {{is planned}} by standardising <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> for its {{constituent}} components. These components are all characterised by their specific technical and functional properties and financial value. Standardised documents, plans and procedures were introduced for optimising maintenance of civil structures. Because <b>the</b> actual annual <b>maintenance</b> need {{does not fit}} into the annual budget in general, prioritisation of measures is necessary. The effect of this prioritisation on the network performance can be optimised using life-cycle costing techniques. Another important aspect is to qualitatively express the network performance to facilitate and assist management. Performance indicators are being developed for this purpose, based on a description of <b>the</b> influence of <b>maintenance</b> on <b>the</b> quality of the network {{in terms of the}} policy objectives “accessibility”, “traffic safety”, “environmental quality”, “comfort ” and “aesthetics”. The cost of <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>programmes</b> can be related to these objectives.

40|$|Complex {{technical}} {{systems are}} normally repaired rather than replaced when they fail. It is often desirable {{to analyze the}} reliability characteristics of these systems based on data generated in a customer use environment, {{in order to assess}} the reliability, frequency of failure or other parameters which may be influenced by the systems’ age and usage. Despite the advantages of continuously analyzing reliability data to be able to improve <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme</b> continuously, methods such as parametric and non-parametric analysis are often ignored due to a belief that the mean time between failures (MTBF) is sufficient to describe the reliability pattern of repairable units.

Reliability data from two repairable units are used to verify the procedure and comparison.

This article seeks to examine the extent to which managerial thinking has been influenced. It uses as evidence interviews with NHS managers conducted in Scotland in 1994. The following uses of capital charges data are explored: capital programme; disposal programme; maintenance programme; contract pricing; and budgetary devolution. New capital programmes required more justification and capital charges were seen as relevant to estate rationalization. Less effect was found with regard to <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>programme,</b> though this may have been due to a downgrading of the estates function in most Trusts. Although the capital charge costs included in contract prices affect the competitive position of providers, there was criticism of the lack of development of the purchasing function. Budgetary devolution was proceeding relatively slowly but, among those Trusts which had devolved capital charges, evidence was found that some clinicians were becoming aware of the full costs of equipment use. This article concludes, with cautious optimism, that capital charges are beginning to influence decisions and that, despite some incentives being dysfunctional, they will lead to a better managed NHS...|$|E

This performance characteristic as measured can be used for verifying the design specifications. After the performance characteristic has been determined, future measurements will show if any deterioration has taken place.

Setting a short-term or long-term reduction target can help to improve dust emission.
