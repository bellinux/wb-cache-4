5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} shell burning produces more helium, the core increases in mass and temperature. In a red giant {{of up to}} 2.25 , {{the mass of the}} helium core becomes degenerate prior to helium fusion. Finally, when the temperature increases sufficiently, helium fusion begins explosively in what is called a helium flash, and the star rapidly shrinks in radius, increases its surface temperature, and moves to <b>the</b> <b>horizontal</b> branch of the HR diagram. For more massive stars, helium core fusion starts before the core becomes degenerate, and the star spends some time in the red clump, slowly burning helium, before the outer convective envelope collapses and the star then moves to <b>the</b> <b>horizontal</b> branch.|$|E

5|$|One change {{made during}} {{production}} was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack. The stall issue {{had been raised}} during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated {{there was a real}} concern. In response, the areas of <b>the</b> <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable <b>the</b> <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of <b>the</b> <b>horizontal</b> stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E

5|$|According to {{aviation}} historian Bill Gunston, on 24 April 1946 {{representatives from}} Mikoyan-Gurevich and the Yakovlev OKB tossed a coin {{to determine which}} aircraft {{would be the first}} Soviet jet to fly. (MiG had brought the I-300, and Yakovlev the Yak-(3)-15.) MiG won and the I-300's first flight lasted six minutes. These early flights revealed problems with the stability of the aircraft and vibration problems with the new articulated heatshield. It was stiffened before the twelfth flight, but that only partially cured the problem. The first aircraft crashed, killing the pilot, during a demonstration in front of high-ranking officials on 11 July when the attachment lugs of the wing leading edge fairings failed and they hit <b>the</b> <b>horizontal</b> stabilizers. The remaining two prototypes began flight testing the following month, but preparations for the 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution delayed the start of the State acceptance trials until 17 December. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer of the second prototype disintegrated during flight, but the pilot was able to land the aircraft safely. Another such incident happened to the third prototype in February 1947 and forced the tail to be reinforced.|$|E
5|$|According {{to current}} {{physical}} cosmology theory, carbon is {{formed in the}} interiors of stars in <b>the</b> <b>horizontal</b> branch by the collision and transformation of three helium nuclei. When those stars die as supernova, the carbon is scattered into space as dust. This dust becomes component material {{for the formation of}} second or third-generation star systems with accreted planets. The Solar System is one such star system with an abundance of carbon, enabling the existence of life as we know it.|$|E
5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in <b>the</b> <b>horizontal</b> direction, and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of <b>the</b> <b>horizontal</b> wind is proportional to <b>the</b> <b>horizontal</b> temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{architecture}} of English cathedrals is so diverse and inventive, the internal appearances differ a great deal. However, in general, English cathedral interiors tend to give an impression of length. This is in part {{because many of the}} buildings are actually very long, but also because more than in the medieval architecture of any other country, <b>the</b> <b>horizontal</b> direction is given as much visual emphasis as the vertical. This is particularly the case at Wells where, unlike most Gothic buildings, there are no vertical shafts that continue from the arcade to the vault and there is a very strong emphasis on the triforium gallery with its seemingly endless and undifferentiated row of narrow arches. Salisbury has a similar lack of verticals while the course below the triforium and the undecorated capitals of Purbeck stone create strong visual horizontals. In the cases of Winchester, Norwich and Exeter <b>the</b> <b>horizontal</b> effect is created by the emphasis on the ridge rib of the elaborate vaults.|$|E

40|$|Setting T-bone {{structure}} in <b>the</b> enlarged <b>horizontal</b> section of fishway {{has a good}} effect on increasing the space for fish and the flow depth and on reducing the flow velocity in the fishway. The deposit of sediment in the fishway will affect the flow. In this paper we study <b>the</b> U-turn <b>horizontal</b> section of fishway, for three kinds of slope, three kinds of discharges, and two kinds of outlet width for <b>the</b> U-turn <b>horizontal</b> section of fishway, then discuss the flow depth, the flow velocity and the sediment after setting four kinds of T-bone structure. By analyzing the experiment data, we know when slope and discharge reduced, the flow velocity in <b>the</b> U-turn <b>horizontal</b> section of fishway can reduce, and the sediment can be less. When the outlet width for <b>the</b> U-turn <b>horizontal</b> section of fishway decreases, the flow velocity in <b>the</b> U-turn <b>horizontal</b> section of fishway can reduce and the flow depth in <b>the</b> U-turn <b>horizontal</b> section of fishway can increase, but the sediment in <b>the</b> U-turn <b>horizontal</b> section of fishway would be more, although can reduce the flow velocity and increase the flow depth, but actually can occur blocks in the fishway. Setting T-bone {{structure in}} <b>the</b> U-turn <b>horizontal</b> section of fishway has a more obvious effect on place which sediment deposit in the fishway. When the outlet width for <b>the</b> U-turn <b>horizontal</b> section of fishway is 40 cm, and T-bone structure is B type, the sediment in <b>the</b> U-turn <b>horizontal</b> section of fishway will be least, so the fishway has no blockade. It is also expected that these findings can be employed as a reference in the similar design of engineering practice. 在魚道放寬水平段內設置丁骨構造物，確實能達到增加魚類棲息空間、提昇水深及減緩流速之目的，但砂石進入水平段內之淤砂情形則是影響魚道是否能暢通的主要原因；因此本研究針對魚道水平迴頭彎段之部份，在三種坡度、三種流量和兩種魚道水平迴頭彎段之出口寬度下，進行加砂試驗，並對架設四種不同丁骨構造物型態下之水深、流速及淤砂量加以探討。 經由試驗資料分析，坡度及流量愈小時，魚道水平迴頭彎段的流速會減緩，且魚道水平迴頭彎段淤砂量也會減少；魚道水平迴頭彎段出口寬度變小時，魚道水平迴頭彎段的流速會變小，且魚道水平迴頭彎段的水位會提升，但魚道水平迴頭彎段內的砂石量卻會增加，雖然能減緩流速且增加水深，但是卻會發生阻塞魚道的情形；在魚道水平迴頭彎段內設置丁骨構造物時，影響魚道水平迴頭彎段之砂石淤積位置較為明顯，當魚道水平迴頭彎段出口寬度為 40 cm，且丁骨構造物設置型態為B型時，其在魚道水平迴頭彎段的淤砂量最少，並不會有堵塞魚道的情形發生，希望此研究能對將來在魚道之內部設計方面有所幫助。第一章 前言	 1 第二章 前人研究	 3 2. 1 有關防砂壩對河川生態的影響及魚道效用之評估	 3 2. 2 有關魚道設計之研究	 5 2. 3 台灣魚類溯游特性之研究	 12 2. 4 有關丁壩設計之研究	 13 第三章 理論分析	 15 3. 1 消能方式	 15 3. 2 砂丘(Sand Dunes) 	 16 3. 3 丁壩(Spur Dikes) 	 16 第四章 渠槽試驗	 19 4. 1 試驗目的	 19 4. 2 試驗設備	 20 4. 3 試驗設計及條件	 26 4. 4 試驗步驟	 27 第五章 結果與討論	 29 5. 1 魚道水平段之淤砂情形探討	 30 5. 2 魚道水平段之流速情形探討	 44 5. 3 魚道水平段之水位情形探討	 51 第六章 結論與建議	 58 6. 1 結論	 58 6. 2 建議	 60 參考文獻	 61 附表、水平渠槽試驗流速及水位分析表	 6...|$|R
