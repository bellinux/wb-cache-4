5|$|For {{creating}} the steam to turn steam turbines and generate electricity, and for cooling the steam coming {{away from the}} turbines, water is needed, and is thus beneficial to have near any thermal power station. The cooling water that {{is used in the}} Lynemouth power station is taken from a body of water located close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> the North Sea. The water is transferred from the sea <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> by a series of shafts and tunnels. There are three condensers (one per each generating set) in the interior of the power station, which are used to cool the heated water before it is reused in the steam cycle. The cooling water is then transferred back to the North Sea.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being the primary energy source for plants, light functions as a signalling device, providing information <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> such as how much sunlight the plant receives each day. This can result in adaptive changes in {{a process known as}} photomorphogenesis. Phytochromes are the photoreceptors in a plant that are sensitive to light.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} methods of irrigation. They vary {{in how the}} water is {{supplied}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants.</b> <b>The</b> goal is <b>to</b> apply <b>the</b> water <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants</b> as uniformly as possible, so that each <b>plant</b> has <b>the</b> amount of water it needs, neither too much nor too little.|$|R

5|$|At the time, no type {{specimen}} was specified, as the practice only arose later, in the 19th century. When a lectotype (type selected amongst original material) was designated, it {{was assigned to}} specimen 242.1 of Linnaeus' herbarium, the only V.thapsus specimen. The species had previously been designated as type species for Verbascum. European plants exhibit considerable phenotypical variation, which has led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> acquiring many synonyms over the years. Introduced American populations show much less variation.|$|E
5|$|B. coccinea is a {{host for}} the gall midge Dasineura banksiae, {{a species of}} fly that attacks and lays eggs on the leaves between late October and early December. The round white hairy galls are 5–7mm in {{diameter}} and generally contain one larva, or up to five on severely infested plants. The larvae moult and feed until January to March, when they reduce activity until early October. Although these are not harmful <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> they disfigure the cut foliage and hence reduce its value.|$|E

5|$|On 31 August 2006, over 600 people {{attended}} {{a protest against}} the high carbon emissions. It was coordinated by the Camp for Climate Action group. At least 3,000 police officers from 12 forces {{were reported to have}} been drafted in {{for the duration of the}} protest, to safeguard electricity supplies and prevent the protesters from shutting the station down. Thirty-nine people were arrested after trying illegally to gain access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{metabolites}} {{are often}} characterized as either qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative metabolites {{are defined as}} toxins that interfere with an herbivore’s metabolism, often by blocking specific biochemical reactions. Qualitative chemicals are present in plants in relatively low concentrations (often less than 2% dry weight), and are not dosage dependent. They are usually small, water-soluble molecules, and therefore can be rapidly synthesized, transported and stored with relatively little energy cost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> Qualitative allelochemicals are usually effective against non-adapted specialists and generalist herbivores.|$|E
5|$|That night Quatermass {{travels with}} {{journalist}} Hugh Conrad to the prefab town where they meet with construction workers {{who say that}} work has been suspended for all except the 'zombies' ('marked' people). They claim that the meteorites are only over-shots from the plant after one of them lands in a pub. These recent meteorites are falling in hundreds and being collected by special guard teams then returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> Quatermass steals a guard's uniform from a lorry to gain entry <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> As he does this Conrad returns to the pub to telephone his newspaper and reveal everything about the secret alien invasion, but he becomes 'marked' before he can finish. The construction workers, however, hear what he says and decide to take action. Meanwhile, Quatermass is inside a pressure dome, where he sees guards putting meteorites into the tanks of poisonous slime that killed Ward, where together, in the recreated atmosphere of a moon of Saturn, they combine and grow into {{the first of the}} enormous ammonid alien creatures.|$|E

5|$|The Rjukan Line {{was built}} {{with a maximum}} {{gradient}} of 1.5%. In addition to the line <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> a branch line went to the hydroelectric power station at Vemork; completed in 1908 {{it would only be}} used for service technicians to the power station and had a gradient of 5.7%.

5|$|The {{first factor}} {{determining}} optimal defense is risk: {{how likely is}} it that a plant or certain plant parts will be attacked? This is also related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> apparency hypothesis, which states that a plant will invest heavily in broadly effective defenses when the plant is easily found by herbivores. Examples of apparent plants that produce generalized protections include long-living trees, shrubs, and perennial grasses. Unapparent plants, such as short-lived plants of early successional stages, on the other hand, preferentially invest in small amounts of qualitative toxins that are effective against {{all but the most}} specialized herbivores.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth rate}} hypothesis, {{also known as}} the {{resource}} availability hypothesis, states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> A major assumption is that available resources are the limiting factor in determining the maximum growth rate of a plant species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result in a loss of scarce and valuable nutrients.|$|E

25|$|As they feed, aphids often {{transmit}} <b>plant</b> viruses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plants,</b> such as <b>to</b> potatoes, cereals, sugarbeets, {{and citrus}} plants. These viruses can sometimes kill <b>the</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R
5|$|After they hatch, {{the small}} {{caterpillars}} only eat the tissue (parenchyma) between the veins of the leaves. They {{do this to}} avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant's laticifers and transported in the veins. After 3–4 days, the caterpillars also eat flowers, fruit, tendrils, petioles and young stems (as well as continuing to eat leaves), defoliating the entire plant. They are particularly fond of the glands {{at the base of}} the leaf, near the petiole. They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex, which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation. The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an '∞' motion of the head as they walk, this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves. The silk also permits them to climb back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> should they fall. Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk. There are four instars, and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half to three months in the cold season. The caterpillar is whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club-ended black setae. It has five pairs of prolegs on segments 3 to 6 and 10, and six true legs attached to the thorax.|$|E
5|$|Although modern {{biology is}} a {{relatively}} recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. Natural philosophy was studied {{as early as the}} ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indian subcontinent, and China. However, the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to ancient Greece. While the formal study of medicine dates back to Hippocrates (ca. 460 BC – ca. 370 BC), it was Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his History of Animals and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> sciences, even into the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} moth {{was thought to}} be from China or Bengal, but was later found to be endemic to Madagascar. It is found {{throughout}} the year {{in most parts of the}} island, with peak populations between March and August, and smallest numbers between October and December. Females lay about 80 eggs under the leaves of Omphalea spp. The caterpillars are whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and are covered in club-ended black setae. Silk spun from the mouth helps the caterpillars hold on to smooth leaves and climb back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> when they fall. After completing four instars, the caterpillars spin an open network cocoon. The pupal stage lasts from 17 to 23 days.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius alnicola is an ectomycorrhizal species, and {{engages in}} a mutualistic {{association}} with certain plant species. In this association, the hyphae of the fungus permeate {{large volumes of}} soil and obtain scarce elements, especially phosphorus—which is often limiting for plant growth—which they pass on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> in exchange for metabolic products of the plant's photosynthesis. The ectomycorrhizae that the fungus forms in association with Picea engelmannii {{have been shown to}} contain lactifers (latex-producing cells) and pigments similar to the fruit body. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow in groups on the ground under alders and conifers, usually appearing between July and October. It is a fairly common species in the western United States and Baja California. Additional collection locations in Mexico include Veracruz, Villarreal, and Tapia. A population in central and southern California is known to associate with oak trees. In the Rocky Mountains it is associated with the subalpine tree species Englemann Spruce (Picea engelmannii), while at lower elevations it is commonly found with white spruce (Picea glauca). It is also known to associate with Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (genus Pseudotsuga). The mushroom has also been collected from Bageshwar, in the state of Uttarakhand, India.|$|E
5|$|Prehistoric Polynesian {{habitation}} on Nihoa {{may have}} initially {{led to a}} decrease in the plant population of A. brownii. Major threats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> include invasive species, fire, and hybridization with other Amaranthus species. Inbreeding is a serious threat, as the small plant population must reproduce within its own circle resulting in genetic defects. A. brownii is also forced to compete with the non-native weed (Portulaca oleracea), the plant's main alien species threat. In 2002 and 2004, the invasive gray bird grasshopper (Schistocerca nitens) presented an even larger threat to A. brownii. First recorded on the island in 1977, the increasing population density of gray bird grasshoppers led to massive defoliation on the island, leaving A. brownii at greater risk of predation. In 2004 alone, an estimated 400,000 gray bird grasshoppers destroyed almost 90% of the vegetation on Nihoa.|$|E
5|$|The line stopped {{carrying}} {{passengers on}} 5 December 1964, {{as part of}} the rationalisation known as the Beeching Axe. All stations were closed, and all goods yards, passing loops and sidings removed, except the marshalling yard for the Octel freight. Octel's freight traffic totaled 70,000 tons annually, and the railway was kept in order to serve this traffic. Local freight services ceased, and the electric staff system was withdrawn, so that only one train could be on the branch at a time, although that was sufficient for Octel's requirements. The double junction at Gaerwen was also remodelled. Once the freight trains were being worked by diesel locomotives, arrangements were made for the British Rail engines to operate all the way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
