5|$|The {{main effect}} of the aid package was to fuel a rapid {{expansion}} in the urban middle and upper class, while life remained mostly unchanged for South Vietnam's rural majority. This served to increase anti-government resentment among peasants, while solidifying urban support for the Saigon government. US officials {{were aware of the}} failure of the program to propel economic development, but did not try and divert the spending to investment as they regarded the solidification of urban support for the government <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>important.</b> They also used the dependence of the urban class on the CIP to achieve political changes in South Vietnam. In 1963, when the US sought to pressure the government of Ngo Dinh Diem after the alliance began to falter, they cut off funding as a gesture to the urban civil servant and military officer class that they disapproved of Diem. Following the South Vietnamese leader's overthrow and assassination in a US-backed coup, the CIP resumed.|$|E

25|$|This evaluation, {{combined}} with {{the failure of a}} mission of LZ-130 to detect British radars in August 1939, appears to have led to a general underestimation of the usefulness of the British radar systems. In spite of being aware of Chain Home, German reports {{on the state of the}} Royal Air Force written just before the Battle of Britain did not even mention radar at all. Other reports mention it, but do not consider it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>important.</b> Other sections of the Luftwaffe appear to be dismissive of the system as a whole.|$|E

25|$|U.S. Public {{opinion on}} the One-China Policy is much more {{ambiguous}} than {{the opinions of the}} American political elites and policy experts. A Pew Research poll from 2012 found that 84% of policy experts believe it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> to for the U.S. to build a strong relationship with China, where as only 55% of the general public agreed with that statement . This vast difference of agreement between policy experts and the American Public has been translated into recent politics; Donald Trumps phone call 25 days after his inauguration to the President of Taiwan, breaking a decades old policy, possibly representing an expression of current polling showing negative attitudes towards The Peoples Republic of China. Furthermore, U.S. populist attitudes towards the Peoples Republic of China are negative, where China is viewed as an economic adversary rather than a friendly rival. A 2015 Pew Research poll found that 60% of Americans view the loss of jobs to China as very serious, compared to only 21% who view the tensions between China and Taiwan as very serious. Historical trends conducted by Gallup demonstrate an increase in perception among Americans that China is the leading economic power in the world today, with polls in 2000 showing only 10% agreeing with that statement and in 2016, 50% concurring with the statement.|$|E

Eight minutes later, Lion scored the first hit on Lützow; a salvo from the British ship struck the battlecruiser on her forecastle, but no major damage was done. These two hits would prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>important,</b> however, as Lützow took on more water due to damage {{sustained}} later in the battle, since they allowed water to enter the ship above the armored deck. Nearly simultaneously, Lützow dealt a tremendous blow to Lion; one of her 30.5cm shells penetrated the roof of Lions center [...] "Q" [...] turret and detonated the munitions that were stored inside. Only by the resolute actions of the turret commander—Major Francis Harvey, who ordered the magazine be flooded—did the ship avoid a catastrophic magazine explosion. Indeed, approximately 30 minutes after the turret was destroyed, {{the fire in the}} turret spread to the working chamber that was directly above the magazine; there it detonated propellant charges that had been stored there. The resulting explosion would have likely destroyed the ship if the ammunition magazine had not been flooded.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{founding}} {{phase of the}} colony cycle, many foundresses leave their nests and join another. [...] Foundresses that move most frequently join the nest of a full sister, yet do not increase their reproductive rank upon joining a new nest. The moving foundress usually lays her eggs at her previous nest, so joining a new nest is a surprising behavior as the offspring will not be directly related to her. These moving foundresses help care for the offspring, which has been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> {{for the survival of}} the colony.

2500|$|The United States, {{observed}} in 1940 that [...] "many thousands of black cotton farmers each year {{now go to}} the polls, stand in line with their white neighbors, and mark their ballots independently without protest or intimidation, {{in order to determine}} government policy toward cotton production control." [...] However, discrimination towards blacks continued {{as it did in the}} rest of society, and isolated incidents often broke out. On September 25, 1961, Herbert Lee, a black cotton farmer and voter-registration organizer, was shot in the head by a white state legislator in Liberty, Missouri. Yet the cotton industry continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> <b>important</b> for blacks in the southern United States, much more so than for whites. By the late 1920s around two-thirds of all African-American tenants and almost three-fourths of the croppers worked on cotton farms. Three out of four black farm operators earned at least 40% of their income from cotton farming during this period. Studies conducted during the same period indicated that two in three black women from black landowning families were involved in cotton farming.|$|E

I would like to suggest, that patronage, together with other practices that the age itself reveals to us, may be the avenue most likely to lead us into a fruitful social history of the Scientific Revolution, a movement to which the present generation of scholars has devoted itself extensively. In our investigations, it appears to me, we have allowed ourselves to be dominated excessively by concepts derived in the nineteenth century which are more applicable to that century and our own than to ... Efforts to impose them on the 17th century have appeared forced and largely barren, and I want to propose, not as a new dogmatism, but as a topic for discussion, the possibility that we need to come at the problem from a different angle, using seventeenth-century categories instead of nineteenth-century ones. Patronage was certainly a seventeenth-century category.|$|E
