5|$|In 1968, the Hungarian {{theoretical}} biologist Aristid Lindenmayer (1925–1989) {{developed the}} L-system, a formal grammar {{which can be}} used to model plant growth patterns in the style of fractals. L-systems have an alphabet of symbols that can be combined using production rules to build larger strings of symbols, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. In 1975, after centuries of slow development of the mathematics of patterns by Gottfried Leibniz, Georg Cantor, Helge von Koch, Wacław Sierpiński and others, Benoît Mandelbrot wrote a famous paper, How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension, crystallising mathematical <b>thought</b> <b>into</b> the concept of the fractal.|$|E
5|$|Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima {{stresses}} {{the dynamic of}} players' relationships with the main character in Final Fantasy games; thus, he puts significant <b>thought</b> <b>into</b> how that relationship will develop. With Final Fantasy VII, protagonist Cloud Strife's reserved nature led Nojima to include scenarios in which the player can select Cloud's responses to certain situations and dialogue. With Final Fantasy VIII, which also features a reserved lead protagonist in Squall, Nojima wanted to give players actual insight into what the protagonist is thinking, even while other characters remain uninformed: {{this led to the}} inner dialogues Squall has through the game.|$|E

25|$|Modernism and {{liberalism}} do {{not constitute}} rigorous and well-defined schools of theology, but are rather an inclination by some writers and teachers to integrate Christian <b>thought</b> <b>into</b> {{the spirit of the}} Age of Enlightenment. New understandings of history and the natural sciences of the day led directly to new approaches to theology. Its opposition to the fundamentalist teaching resulted in religious debates, such as the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy within the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America in the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|By most accounts, Löhe was {{an ideal}} pastor who interacted {{well with a}} variety of {{different}} classes of people. He focused his theological studies on the Lutheran Confessions and put considerable <b>thought</b> <b>into</b> the celebration of Holy Communion as the center of congregational life. Löhe was especially interested in old Lutheran liturgies. Löhe was also noted for his ontological view of the pastoral office, which he believed existed independently of congregational call but as a direct appointment from Jesus Christ through ordination in opposition to C.F.W. Walther. He combined all these ideas with a heavy insistence on social renewal.|$|E

25|$|The {{specific}} {{functions of}} the ego, {{as determined by the}} relative predominance of sense or intellect, are either {{functions of the}} senses (or organism) or functions of the intellect. The former fall into the two classes of feelings (subjective) and perceptions (objective); the latter, according as the receptive or the spontaneous element predominates, into cognition and volition. In cognition, thought is ontologically oriented to the object; and in volition it is the teleological purpose of thought. In the first case we receive (in our fashion) the object of <b>thought</b> <b>into</b> ourselves. In the latter we plant it out into the world. Both cognition and volition are functions of thought as well as forms of moral action.|$|E
25|$|The French Revolution of 1789 catapulted atheistic <b>thought</b> <b>into</b> {{political}} notability in some Western countries, {{and opened}} the way for the nineteenth century movements of Rationalism, Freethought, and Liberalism. Born in 1792, Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, a child of the Age of Enlightenment, was expelled from England's Oxford University in 1811 for submitting to the Dean an anonymous pamphlet that he wrote entitled, The Necessity of Atheism. This pamphlet is considered by scholars as the first atheistic tract published in the English language. An early atheistic influence in Germany was The Essence of Christianity by Ludwig Feuerbach (1804–1872). He influenced other German nineteenth century atheistic thinkers like Karl Marx, Max Stirner, Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860), and Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900).|$|E
25|$|In his writings, one of al-Kindi's central {{concerns}} was {{to demonstrate}} the compatibility between philosophy and natural theology on the one hand, and revealed or speculative theology on the other (though in fact he rejected speculative theology). Despite this, he did make clear that he believed revelation was a superior source of knowledge to reason because it guaranteed matters of faith that reason could not uncover. And while his philosophical approach was not always original, and was even considered clumsy by later thinkers (mainly {{because he was the}} first philosopher writing in the Arabic language), he successfully incorporated Aristotelian and (especially) neo-Platonist <b>thought</b> <b>into</b> an Islamic philosophical framework. This was an important factor in the introduction and popularization of Greek philosophy in the Muslim intellectual world.|$|E

25|$|Study of the {{unconscious}} mind, {{a part of the}} psyche outside the awareness of the individual which nevertheless influenced thoughts and behavior was a hallmark of early psychology. In one of the first psychology experiments conducted in the United States, C. S. Peirce and Joseph Jastrow found in 1884 that subjects could choose the minutely heavier of two weights even if consciously uncertain of the difference. Freud popularized this concept, with terms like Freudian slip entering popular culture, to mean an uncensored intrusion of unconscious <b>thought</b> <b>into</b> one's speech and action. His 1901 text The Psychopathology of Everyday Life catalogues hundreds of everyday events which Freud explains in terms of unconscious influence. Pierre Janet advanced the idea of a subconscious mind, which could contain autonomous mental elements unavailable to the scrutiny of the subject.|$|E
25|$|Makkali Gosala {{seems to}} have {{combined}} the ideas of older schools of <b>thought</b> <b>into</b> an eclectic doctrine. He appears to have believed in niyati (destiny), svabhava (nature), and sangati (change), and possibly parinama, which may have prompted other philosophical schools to label him variously as ahetuvadin, vainayikavadin, ajnanavadin, and issarakaranavadin. According to him all beings undergo development (parinama). This culminates {{in the course of}} time (samsarasuddhi) in final salvation to which all beings are destined under the impact of the factors of niyati (destiny), bhava (nature), and sangati (change). As such destiny does not appear as the only player, but rather chance or indeterminism plays equal part in his doctrine. He thus subscribed to niyativada (fatalism) only {{in the sense that he}} thought that some future events like salvation for all were strictly determined.|$|E
25|$|Speech {{production}} is {{process by which}} a thought in the brain is converted into an understandable auditory form. This is a multistage mechanism that involves many {{different areas of the}} brain. The first stage is planning, where the brain constructs words and sentences that turn the <b>thought</b> <b>into</b> an understandable form. This occurs primarily in the inferior frontal cortex, specifically in an area known as Broca's area. Next, the brain must plan how to physically create the sounds necessary for speech by linking the planned speech with known sounds, or phonemes. While the location of these associations is not known, it is known that the supplementary motor area {{plays a key role in}} this step. Finally, the brain must signal for the words to actually be spoken. This is carried out by the premotor cortex and the motor cortex.|$|E

3000|$|However, these {{unconscious}} processes {{might have}} some inhibitory effects on conscious learning processes by evoking-task irrelevant thoughts and leading students to devote their available working memory capacity to processing these thoughts. Unconscious processing can bring not only a mark of past experiences, but also evaded or forgotten <b>thoughts,</b> <b>into</b> current emotional states, behavioural tendencies, flow of <b>thoughts,</b> and <b>into</b> learning processes (Haggerty et al. 2010; Schacter 1992; Ziori and Dienes 2006). A series of studies {{on the use of}} working memory demonstrated that negative emotions (e.g., sadness, hopelessness) brought task-irrelevant <b>thoughts</b> <b>into</b> conscious cognitive activities, thereby unnecessarily loading the available capacity, diverting attention from the task, and hampering memory performance (Ellis et al. 1995, 1997 a [...]...|$|R

25|$|The Italian {{peninsula}} {{was known}} for its high-quality wines, outstanding examples of which included those of Pompeii. As the republic grew into empire beyond the peninsula, wine's trade and market economy echoed this growth. The wine trade in Italy consisted of Rome's sale of wine abroad to settlements and provinces around the Mediterranean Sea, yet {{by the end of}} the 1st century AD, its exports had competition from the provinces, themselves exporters to Rome. The Roman market economy encouraged the provinces’ exports, enhancing supply and demand. An elevated supply of wine meant lower prices for consumers. Because of the supply-and-demand economy, citizens possessed an ample supply of coinage, suggesting the existence of a complex market economy surrounding the wine trade of the Roman Empire. Adequate monetary supply meant that the citizenry put a great deal of <b>thought</b> <b>into</b> the market economy of wine.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the dawn}} of the 20th century, the {{philosophy}} of Nietzsche has had great intellectual and political influence around the world. Nietzsche applied himself to such topics as morality, religion, epistemology, psychology, ontology, and social criticism. Because of Nietzsche's evocative style and his often outrageous claims, his philosophy generates passionate reactions running from love to disgust. Nietzsche noted in his autobiographical Ecce Homo that his philosophy developed over time, so interpreters have found it difficult to relate concepts central to one work to those central to another, for example, the thought of the eternal recurrence features heavily in Also sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spoke Zarathustra), but is almost entirely absent from his next book, Beyond Good and Evil. Added to this challenge is the fact that Nietzsche did not seem concerned to develop his <b>thought</b> <b>into</b> a system, even {{going so far as to}} disparage the attempt in Beyond Good and Evil.|$|E

According to Marilyn Butler, it [...] "combined {{many of the best}} features of the periodicals of the century.

500|$|Over the years, {{three main}} ideas of hippocampal {{function}} {{have dominated the}} literature: response inhibition, episodic memory, and spatial cognition. The behavioral inhibition theory (caricatured by John O'Keefe and Lynn Nadel as [...] "slam on the brakes!") was very popular up to the 1960s. It derived much of its justification from two observations: [...] first, that animals with hippocampal damage tend to be hyperactive; second, that animals with hippocampal damage often have difficulty learning to inhibit responses that they have previously been taught, especially if the response requires remaining quiet as in a passive avoidance test. Jeffrey Gray developed this line of <b>thought</b> <b>into</b> a full-fledged theory {{of the role of}} the hippocampus in anxiety. The inhibition theory is currently the least popular of the three.|$|E

It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loathe to disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|R
