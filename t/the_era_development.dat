Data of the research were a number of Makassarese manuscripts. The research used the qualitative descriptive method by using a number of data collection techniques namely scrutinizing the manuscripts/observing, and interviewing to find out the philosophical symbols of the character building values. The data analysis result indicates that a number of the character building values is generally disclosed by the symbolization having the philosophical meanings. The character building to intertwine the social relationship in the community teacher to become the useful people the value concept of ???tau??? meaning ???human being??? with the derived words sipakatau ???to humanize/to respect one another???, pattau ???greeting other people???, katauang ???genitals (of male and female) ???. The character building values concerning honesty, cooperation, and motivation to progress are mostly found with the various symbolic manifestations because the character is regarded that {{it is very important to}} develop and lead a nation. The character indicator development refers to the philosophy of a number of the objects which is familiar with the socio-cultural life of Buginese-Makassarese community such as a cock (the characters of being tough, time aware, responsible), deer (the characters of being capable and smart), pigeon (the character of loyalty), betel (the character of high motivation like its creeping nature), areca nut (the characters of high ideals and honesty because of its straight stem nature). The transformation model of the character building can be applied by the reconstruction model (development of printed teaching material/multimedia), integration (in the curriculum of learning with various character substance types). The transformation of the local culture based the socio-cultural values is very important to be carried out as one of the solutions of the modernization and globalization consequences, and a social shift in the 21 st century, so that it is still relevant with <b>the</b> <b>era</b> <b>development...</b>|$|E

The report introduces what ERA is and how the activities and instruments at European level have fundamentally changed and broadened. It provides a discussion of key initiatives at European level and their interrelation with German R&I policy. In the last decade, and accelerated in the recent years, the European research policy and subsequently the innovation policy have undergone dramatic changes. A range of long-term ambitious initiatives have been developed, most notably within the path-breaking ERA process (research) and the Lisbon strategy (growth). This report addresses these developments by differentiating between traditional (Framework Programme, EUREKA and COST) and new instruments. The new instruments deviate from the classical cooperation funding by addressing either excellence (ERC, EIT) or coordination issues (ETP, ERA-Net). Moreover, also at European level research is no longer a stand-alone approach. Instead, innovation has gained rapidly in importance as a key driver for economic growth. In this report, we present evidence from document analysis and expert interviews for the merit and challenges of the instruments in general and in particular with respect to Germany...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of using the}} collective field {{of a large number}} of electrons to effect the acceleration of protons to high energies in a compact accelerator [...] or to permit acceleration of heavier ions in a manner not critically dependent on the charge-to-mass ratio of these ions [...] has been noted in an earlier Comment. A most attractive conceptual form for such an accelerator is the electron ring accelerator (ERA) and in the present Comment they direct attention to the basic phenomena [...] insofar as they know them [...] that govern the design and operation of an ERA. Briefly, the ERA concept visualizes the use of a compact ring of relativistic electrons that circulate in a plane perpendicular to an external magnetic field. The ring is partially neutralized by ions held in the potential well of the electrons. The electric field of these ions and the magnetic attractive forces between the circulating electrons then together act to overcome the electrostatic repulsion of the electrons and make possible the achievement of a configuration that is self-stable in the absence of external focusing fields. Acceleration of the ring with its accompanying ions, in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the ring, can be achieved (at the expense of the azimuthal motion of the electrons) by the action of a spatially decreasing magnetic guide field or, alternatively, by means of rf or pulsed electric fields. In any case the ring must provide a sufficiently strong'holding field' to permit ions to remain with the ring and thereby be carried to high energy in a short distance. An electron ring of suitable quality for this purpose might be formed by compressing a rather large and reasonably intense (e. g., {approx} 100 A, circulating) ring in a pulsed magnetic field, thereby reducing its major and minor radii from R {approx} 20 cm and a {approx} 1 cm to, for example, R {approx} 3 cm and a {approx} 0. 1 cm. A ring of this intensity (N{sub e} {approx} 2 - 3 x 10 {sup 12 } electrons) and final dimensions would produce a holding field of some tens of MV per meter. The group at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna [...] formerly led by Veksler [...] has been the first in forming and compressing rings and in demonstrating the acceleration of ions by means of them. Major development programs, employing pulsed compressors, are in progress at Dubna, Berkeley, Karlsruhe, and Garching (Munich). Related work with static-field compression is under way the University of Maryland and elsewhere. The possibilities and problems raised by the electron-ring concept have been reviewed recently by Keefe, who also provides some details concerning the experimental program at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, Berkeley. The Soviet work has already demonstrated [...] to a certain degree [...] the validity of the basic ERA concept, but, if an ERA device is to be useful, it is necessary to achieve rings of high quality; that is, rings of small dimensions and containing large numbers of electrons. Attention, therefore, must be directed to the fundamental limitations upon rings. After reviewing, in Section 1, the fundamental limits on rings, they shall discuss in Section 2 of the Comment the ultimate performance (as presently foreseen) of an ERA. Finally, in Section 3, they attempt briefly to summarize the present status of <b>the</b> <b>ERA</b> <b>development...</b>|$|E
