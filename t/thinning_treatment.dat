Both cut/pile/burn and mastication treatments were equally effective at reducing the target fuels which were mature, live pinyon trees. Application costs though differed substantially, with the cut/pile/burn technique being less expensive. <b>Thinning</b> <b>treatments</b> increased the abundance of herbaceous vegetation, although {{in some cases the}} strength of the increase was constrained by the level of pre-treatment tree dominance. Increases in perennial grass cover and density in response to thinning were usually greatest at lower levels of pre-treatment pinyon dominance, whereas native annual forb density and cover responded fairly equally along the tree-dominance gradient. Shrub abundance declined in response to pre-treatment tree dominance and the response to <b>thinning</b> <b>treatments</b> appeared more subtle than for herbaceous vegetation. Shrub cover within the control decreased slightly during the 3 post-treatment years, while it increased slightly within both <b>thinning</b> <b>treatments.</b> The response of slower-growing plants such as shrubs will need to be evaluated during future years to determine differences between <b>thinning</b> <b>treatments.</b> Species richness within the two <b>thinning</b> <b>treatments</b> steadily increased relative to the control {{over the course of the}} 3 years following treatment. Species richness was also consistent across the pinyon-dominance gradient, which suggests that the ability for vegetation to recover at this location may not be significantly limited by a lack of seed availability or lack of species diversity within highly tree-encroached shrublands. Cover of herbaceous live fuels (perennial and annual forbs and grasses) and live woody fuels (live shrubs and trees) were also similar between the two <b>thinning</b> <b>treatments</b> and higher than the control. The greatest difference in fuel structure between the two fuel treatments appeared to be dead woody fuel loads— mastication clearly resulted in greater fine fuel loads (1 – 100 hour fuels) as well as the shredded woody particles. The stimulation of live herbaceous cover—especially at lower pre-treatment pinyon dominance—may have important implications for fire spread by enhancing the continuity of surface fuels, especially during dry years...|$|R

Plantations are important CO 2 sinks, but the mechanism by which thinning affects the quantity and stability of soil organic carbon (SOC) is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the effects of different thinning intensities (low-intensity <b>thinning</b> <b>treatment</b> with 30 % of the trees removed; high intensity <b>thinning</b> <b>treatment</b> with 70 % of the trees removed; control treatment without tree removal) on the quantity and stability of SOC in Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolate [Lamb. ] Hook) plantations in southeastern China. The amounts of SOC, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), easily oxidizable carbon (EOC), cold-water-soluble organic carbon (CWSOC) and hot-water-extractable organic carbon (HWEOC) and the carbon-cycle -related enzyme activities (p-glucosidase, invertase and cellulose) were quantified. We found that thinning significantly decreased the amount of SOC compared with the control treatment, but the effect differed by sampling date. The MBC and EOC were significantly higher in the high-intensity <b>thinning</b> <b>treatment</b> than in the control and low-intensity thinning treatments, whereas the invertase and P-glucosidase activities were significantly higher in the control treatment. However, the amounts of CWSOC, HWEOC and cellulose activity did not differ among the treatments, which indicates that the MBC, EOC and the activities of invertase and p-glucosidase were better indicators of changes in SOC to thinning. In addition, the MBC, EOC, CWSOC and the p-glucosidase and cellulase activities peaked in the warmer months. Our results indicate that thinning treatments in Chinese fir plantations decreased the SOC quantity and enzyme activities and that high-intensity thinning may lead to an increase of labile SOC.

We assessed the interpretation of empirical semivariograms in describing spatial pattern and whether semivariogram parameters can be useful when comparing impacts of different thinning regimes. We simulated vegetation patterns to test the ability of empirical semivariograms to describe patch sizes and suggest a nonparametric semivariogram range parameter as a metric of patch size. We applied results from the simulations to data from a long-term thinning study, in which intensity and spatial patterns of thinnings varied. We used range parameters from semivariograms of percent cover to compare response of patch sizes among <b>thinning</b> <b>treatments</b> and life forms. Initial results indicated that empirical semivariograms quantified both patch sizes and distance between patches. Nonparametric semivariogram estimates of patch size showed differences among <b>thinning</b> <b>treatments,</b> suggesting that spatial patterns of overstory conditions are influencing spatial distributions of understory vegetation. Patches of selected clonal shrubs were smallest in the treatment with spatially variable thinnings.

The potential effect of silvicultural treatments on reducing damages from southern pine beetle depends on treatments and the assumed probability of damages in a region. This research evaluated the stand level benefits and costs of prevention treatments used to reduce damages from Southern Pine Beetles. For the 13 southern states, a broad set of treatments were applied to a set of representative stands to characterize the SPB Prevention Program impacts. The representative stands were used in a growth and yield model and were projected into the future under various conditions and treatments. The products from the growth and yield model were then used to estimate soil expectation value (SEV), which was adjusted to account for the risk associated with the probability of tree mortality from SPB (Martell, 1980).

Streamflow changes were closely associated with changes in a groundwater discharge area in the valley floor.
