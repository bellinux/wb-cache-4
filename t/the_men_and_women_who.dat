25|$|Since the {{founding}} of the country, the United States has sought to compensate <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> have served in its armed forces. In 1917, the U.S. Congress passed legislation emphasizing an indemnity model for veterans disability benefits. Congress sought to clarify and better specify provisions of the law in 1919 amendments to the original bill. Since that year, compensation has been provided to veterans suffering from physical or mental disabilities that were incurred during, or aggravated by, military service, and which have adversely impacted the veteran's ability to work. The amount of compensation provided—both cash payments and VA-sponsored services—are based on the veteran's average impairment in earnings capacity. Since OIF/OEF, PTSD has grown to be the third most compensated disability in the VA after hearing loss and tinnitus.|$|E

25|$|Jersey Shore's {{location}} on the West Branch Susquehanna River, just downstream {{from the mouth of}} Pine Creek made it an ideal location for traders and other businessmen who outfitted the pioneers who settled the western most portions of the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley and the Pine Creek valley. Thomas Martin was a farmer who sold his produce to the people of Jersey Shore and to <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were just passing through. Mr. Martin was noted for his strong beliefs regarding the prices that he set. For example, if he believed that his potatoes were worth 35 cents a bushel, he would sell them for 35 cents a bushel, no more no less. If his competitors would sell potatoes for 50 cents a bushel, Martin would not raise his price and if others lowered the price to 25 cents per bushel, he would not lower his price. This firmness and fairness allowed Thomas Martin to rise to a position of prominence in Jersey Shore and Lycoming County. His reputation for fairness and honesty was passed onto his son Lewis Martin who went on to serve as a Lycoming County prothonotary and as a deputy U.S. Marshal.|$|E
