5|$|Although {{atherosclerosis}} {{occurs to}} a certain degree in all people, people with FH may develop accelerated atherosclerosis due to the excess level of LDL. The degree of atherosclerosis approximately depends on the number of LDL receptors still expressed and the functionality of these receptors. In many heterozygous forms of FH, the receptor function is only mildly impaired, and LDL levels will remain relatively low. In <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> homozygous forms, the receptor is not expressed at all.|$|E

'"Cook, housemaid, and nursemaid; each female servant {{required}} {{to join the}} Little Bethel Congregation three times every Sunday--with a serious footman.

5|$|It {{had been}} well {{understood}} by the Dutch that the forces occupying the Grebbe Line would not be sufficiently strong to repel all attacks by themselves; they were intended to delay an offensive long enough for reserves to reinforce them. Due to the failure the previous day {{to understand that the}} German main assault was imminent, these reserves would not arrive in time to intervene in the fight at the defence zone between the two trench systems. This was all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> as the Stop Line had no depth and lacked large shelters to accommodate enough troops to stage a strong frontal counterattack. In the late evening it was decided to execute a flank attack from the north the next day.|$|E
5|$|The {{consumption}} of aviation gasoline during combat and resupply operations {{was so great}} in the early phase of the war, taxing the very limited supply available in the Far East, that it became one of <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> logistical problems facing UN planners. Ocean tankers could rarely {{keep pace with the}} rate of consumption. Although the situation never forced the UN to halt its air operations, on several occasion the situation became quite dire, and was only rectified by the rapid procurement of supplies from Japan. On a number of occasions throughout the war, the demand of military consumption had the effect of leaving Japanese gas stations with no fuel to sell to the public.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{broke out}} shortly after Minton joined the court, {{creating}} {{a flood of}} cases in which legal precedent provided little guidance, including challenges to wartime measures, selective service laws, price controls, rationing and civil liberties. In {{the majority of these}} cases, the court affirmed the decisions of the district courts, but in several the court was required to establish a precedent. Minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to affirm the decisions of the lower courts. He believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced judgment was generally able to make a decision that was superior to appellate courts' decisions. He believed the appellate process should be reserved for <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> cases and cases where the lower court had clearly made a mistake.|$|E

5|$|State {{auditors}} Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) soon arrive, and {{the extremely}} cheerful Chris paints an optimistic {{picture of how}} they will fix the budget, but leaves the details to <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> Ben. When Ben explains {{they will need to}} slash the budget of every department by nearly 40 or 50 percent, Leslie angrily lashes out at Ben, who responds to her that the poorly managed government is to blame. Later, at April's party, Tom desperately tries to pick up women, but to no avail, while Leslie and Ann get extremely drunk together. Andy and April appear to be getting along, but when he goes to the bar to get a drink for April, a drunken Ann flirts with him. An upset April flirts with Tom's annoying friend Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz) to make Andy jealous. Andy gets upset, believing he misread April's signals all along, and April later regrets what she did. Ben arrives at the party and tries to smooth things out with a drunken Leslie, but she again angrily lashes out at him.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{between the}} ships was fiercely contested, but the {{smaller and more}} lightly armed Boston seemed to be taking <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> damage when at 6:20 Captain Courtenay was thrown to the deck. What happened next has been subject to debate, with the second-in-command, Lieutenant John Edwards claiming that Courtenay had been killed and he was thrown overboard as was the custom at the time. However rumours subsequently circulated that Courtenay had only been knocked unconscious when Edwards gave the order to jettison him, a story that his family credited and was later {{taken up by the}} contemporary historian Edward Pelham Brenton, although historian William James subsequently defended Edwards' actions. With Courtenay gone, Boston continued to suffer severe damage until just after 07:00, when the remaining officers ordered all surviving sails set and the British ship attempted to escape. Although Bompart pursued, by 08:00 the strain had proved too much for his ship and he fell back. After a close encounter with French ships in the Delaware River, Boston eventually escaped to St John's, Newfoundland while Embuscade refitted in New York.|$|E
5|$|The long {{investigation}} {{time span}} was causing {{problems for the}} prosecutors as {{an increasing number of}} the counts were meeting their statutes of limitations. The police announced in September 1973 that they were working on indictments towards Tjøntveit and two of the creditors who placed their representatives on the board after the company was insolvent. The police investigation was concluded in May 1975. By then, the statutes of limitations for the accounting issues had passed, and the police focused on <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> charge of debt manipulation. Tjøntveit and two board members were indicted in 1976. The managing committee for the winding-up released its report in November 1977; the report concluded that although the company's books showed assets of NOK8.6 million, in reality it only had fifty Norwegian krone. The committee further criticized the company for having too low a share capital, lack of qualified management and insufficient competence in operation and management of large aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In Norway, {{close to}} all {{newspapers}} have switched from the broadsheet to the tabloid format, which measures 280 x 400 mm. The three biggest newspapers are VG, Dagbladet, and Aftenposten, the former the most sensationalist one and <b>the</b> latter <b>more</b> <b>serious.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Denmark, tabloids in the British sense {{are known}} as 'formiddagsblade' (before-noon {{newspaper}}s), the two biggest being BT and Ekstra Bladet. <b>The</b> old <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> newspaper Berlingske Tidende shifted from broadsheet to tabloid format in 2006, while keeping the news profile intact.|$|R

5|$|The {{main body}} {{compartments}} that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life {{of lead in}} these tissues is measured in weeks for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> health effects on children. The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20 to 30years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40days, {{but it may be}} longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.|$|E

Surgery, however, {{does not appear to be}} better than non surgical care.|$|R

25|$|The iambic senarius (ia6) is the commonest metre in Roman comedy. It {{was used}} for the prologues of plays and for <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> speeches. It is the only metre which was unaccompanied by music. This metre is {{commoner}} in Terence than in Plautus.|$|E
25|$|Verdelot, {{along with}} Costanzo Festa, is {{considered}} to be the father of the madrigal, an a cappella vocal form which emerged in the late 1520s from a convergence of several previous musical streams (including the frottola, the canzone, the laude, and also including some influence from <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> style of the motet).|$|E

50|$|Male heroes {{adopted the}} new sentimental {{character}} traits in the 1760s. Laurence Sterne's Yorick, {{the hero of}} the Sentimental Journey (1768) did so with an enormous amount of humour. Oliver Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield (1766) and Henry Mackenzie's Man of Feeling (1771) produced <b>the</b> far <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> role models.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, Whitehurst circled, {{apparently}} out of control. Yet, when Vigilance {{caught up}} with the damaged ship and came alongside at 1530, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> fires on board the escort vessel had been controlled. Vigilance's fire fighting and damage control parties helped to extinguish the remaining blaze and made emergency repairs.|$|E
25|$|Sadil was {{committed}} to trial in March 1994, but the Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to proceed with <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>serious</b> espionage-related charges after reviewing the evidence against him.

50|$|Even when <b>the</b> {{charges are}} <b>more</b> <b>serious,</b> {{prosecutors}} often can still bluff defense attorneys {{and their clients}} into pleading guilty to a lesser offense. As a result, {{people who might have}} been acquitted because of lack of evidence, but also who are in fact truly innocent, will often plead guilty to the charge. Why? In a word, fear. And <b>the</b> <b>more</b> numerous and <b>serious</b> <b>the</b> charges, studies have shown, the greater the fear. That explains why prosecutors sometimes seem to file every charge imaginable against defendants.|$|R
