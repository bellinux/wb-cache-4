These projections are appropriate for the sellers of stumpage but may not be appropriate for the producers of forest products who also own and manage the raw resource. To identify the most desirable management strategies for land-based mills, the yield model must be capable of making good estimates of final product yields, such as dry weight of pulp, lineal feet of veneer, and size and grade distribution of lumber. The Mississippi State University loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) growth and yield simulator has a dry weight pulp yield model fully integrated in the program. Dry weight pulp yields were estimated from stand and tree characteristics using a neural network model for predicting the distribution of wood chip weight by <b>thickness</b> <b>class</b> and a single tree dry weight pulp yield model. These models were embedded in the profile function based tree volume estimator of a cutover site-prepared plantation loblolly pine growth and yield simulator.

Although experienced observers are a spill response 2 ̆ 7 s mainstay, few trained observers and confounding factors including weather, oil emulsification, and scene illumination geometry present challenges. DWH spill and impact monitoring was aided by extensive airborne and spaceborne passive and active remote sensing. Oil slick thickness and oil-to-water emulsion ratios are key spill response parameters for containment/cleanup and were derived quantitatively for thick (3 ̆e 0. 1 mm) slicks from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) data using a spectral library approach {{based on the}} shape and depth of near infrared spectral absorption features. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite, visible-spectrum broadband data of surface-slick modulation of sunglint reflection allowed extrapolation to the total slick. A multispectral expert system used a neural network approach to provide Rapid Response <b>thickness</b> <b>class</b> maps. Airborne and satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides synoptic data under all-sky conditions; however, SAR generally cannot discriminate thick (3 ̆e 100 μm) oil slicks from thin sheens (to 0. 1 μm). The UAVSAR 2 ̆ 7 s (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR) significantly greater signal-to-noise ratio and finer spatial resolution allowed successful pattern discrimination related {{to a combination of}} oil slick thickness, fractional surface coverage, and emulsification. In situ burning and smoke plumes were studied with AVIRIS and corroborated spaceborne CALIPSO (Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) observations of combustion aerosols. CALIPSO and bathymetry lidar data documented shallow subsurface oil, although ancillary data were required for confirmation. Airborne hyperspectral, thermal infrared data have nighttime and overcast collection advantages and were collected as well as MODIS thermal data.

Simultaneously acquired Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are available for many of the flight tracks. Since ice thickness measurements are considerably more difficult to accomplish than surface measurements, it is important to improve techniques for estimating thickness from surface characteristics by means of remote sensing. Radar signatures are dependent on ice surface topography and ice volume properties, but ice thickness cannot be measured directly by means of radar. The surface and thickness profiles were analysed in order to improve understanding of the relation between surface roughness and ice thickness. The stochastic properties of the surface profiles have been analysed and parameters have been extracted to characterize the roughness.

The vertical roots of one-year Scots pine seedlings were pruned to the length of 5, 10, 15 i 20 cm and measured. The scope of measurements included: stem length and thickness, total root length, root length within <b>thickness</b> <b>classes,</b> surface root area, root volume as well as the number of root tips and ramifications. The measurements of root systems were performed with the use of a scanner and WinRhizo software.

In October of this year the seedlings were lifted from the ground and measured again at the same scope. Reiterated measurements allowed evaluation of increment characteristics after transplanting. The results indicated negative impacts of intensive root pruning before transplantation on seedling survival rates. Severe pruning of seedling vertical roots had negative effects on increment gained by both above- and underground seedling parts.

Traditionally the superficial deposits are subdivided into zones without considering the thickness information; and some efforts {{have been made to}} integrate the thickness information into the domain classification methods to estimate the groundwater recharge. These methods depend on expert judgement and different people could produce different results. A new method was developed in this study to objectively estimate groundwater recharge and runoff considering the spatial distribution and thickness of glacial till. The SLiM was selected to simulate the runoff and recharge processes using readily available temporal and distributed meteorological factors and catchment characteristics. The glacial till were divided into five <b>thickness</b> <b>classes,</b> i. e., 0 – 2 m, 2 m – 5 m, 5 m – 10 m, 10 m – 30 m, based on the observed results from a glacial till field experiment undertaken by BGS; and the reduction of recharge due to the presence of glacial till was identified based on Monte Carlo runs of SLiM. Modelled runoff hydrographs were compared with observed ones for calibration purpose. The results show that the measured recharge rate (1. 16 – 1. 28 mm day- 1) using tracer technique in the study area is within the range of estimated average recharge (0 - 1. 45 mm day- 1). The recharge modelled can also reflect the characteristics of the temperate climates.

BackgroundAn association between maximum LV wall thickness and risk of sudden death was suggested in HCM. This finding requires further investigation, given the important implications for risk stratification and treatment. MethodsWe analyzed the mortality and risk profile of 237 patients (age 41 ± 17 years; 63 % male) classified into five groups based on echocardiographic maximum LV thickness. ResultsDuring follow-up (12 ± 7 years), 36 patients died of cardiovascular causes, including 16 sudden deaths. Maximum LV thickness {{was not associated with}} a risk of sudden death (p = 0. 37) nor with overall cardiovascular mortality (p = 0. 7). With the exception of the small subset with thickness values ≤ 15 mm, with a consistently benign clinical course, the distribution of sudden death and overall cardiovascular mortality was not significantly different among the other four classes, ranging from 16 to 19 mm to ≥ 30 mm. Among 30 patients with extreme LV thickness (≥ 30 mm), only one sudden event occurred among six patients diagnosed at < 18 years of age (17 %) and none among 24 diagnosed at ≥ 18 years of age. The prevalence of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, syncope, an abnormal blood pressure response to exercise, and atrial fibrillation was similar among the five <b>thickness</b> <b>classes.</b> ConclusionsDuring 12 -year follow-up, we observed no association between maximum LV thickness and cardiovascular mortality in a community-based population with HCM. The degree of maximum LV wall thickness should be considered {{in the context of a}} multifactorial approach to risk stratification, rather than as an isolated risk factor. Only in those patients diagnosed at a very young age might the presence of extreme LV wall thickness represent, per se, a potential marker of risk of sudden death...|$|R
40|$|Ary Bruand : Present Address : Institut des Sciences de la Terre d'OrléansInternational audienceThis study {{discusses}} {{the use of}} a deterministic model, at a regional scale, when the soils have small heterogeneity. Long-term soil drainage was simulated on 3500 ha in Beauce (France), taking into account variation in soil thickness, agricultural practices, and climate characteristics for a 32 -yr period. The model was based on a numerical solution of Richards' equation, using a finite element method. Hydraulic properties were determined at four sites that are 4 km apart. The results show a small variability of hydraulic parameters, with coefficient of variation (CV) ranges from 1 to 16 % for the α parameter, the empirical constant n, the saturated water content θs, and the residual water content θr, and from 60 to 75 % for the saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks. Hence, the spatial and temporal variability of drainage are mainly related to soil thickness, agricultural practices, and climate characteristics. Assigning small spatial variability to hydraulic properties, we analyzed the role of soil thickness and initial water content (IWC), induced by agricultural practices and climate characteristics, on drainage prediction. Five IWC were defined: 100, 90, 80, 70, and 55 % of field capacity (FC). Four soil thicknesses were studied: 30, 60, 100, and 150 cm. The IWC appeared as a significant factor in drainage prediction for 60 % of the 32 yr, regardless of soil thickness. Soil thickness became the most significant factor (20 % of the 32 yr) for low IWC. The model was spatially extrapolated by combining the calculated drainage (which varied with soil thickness and IWC) and the spatial distribution of crops and soil <b>thickness</b> <b>classes.</b> Simulated drainage was closely related (r = 0. 90) to groundwater recharge during the 32 yr, indicating that the model could be applied to other areas with appropriate parameters...|$|R

Based on {{a unique set of}} topographic and soil thickness data in the Ardennes (Belgium), we combine the new CLICHE model of climate-dependent hillslope evolution with an inversion algorithm in order to get deeper insight into the ways and timing of hillslope dynamics under one such climatic cycle. We simulate the evolution of a synthetic hill reproducing the slope, curvature, and contributing area distributions of the hillslopes of a ~ 2500 km 2 real area under a simple two-stage 120 -kyr-long climatic scenario with linear transitions between cold and warm stages. The inversion method samples a misfit function in the model parameter space, based on estimates of the fit of topographic derivative distributions in <b>classes</b> of soil <b>thickness</b> and of the relative frequencies of the predicted soil <b>thickness</b> <b>classes.</b> Though the inversion results show remarkable convergence patterns for most parameters, no unique solution emerges. We obtain five clusters of good fits, whose centroids are taken as acceptable model solutions. Based on the predicted time series of average denudation rate and soil thickness, plus snapshots of the soil distribution at characteristic times, we discuss these solutions and, comparing them with independent data not involved in the misfit function, we identify the most realistic scenario. Beyond providing first-order estimates of several parameters that compare well with published data, our results show that denudation rates increase dramatically for a short time at both warm–cold and cold–warm transitions, when the mean annual temperature passes through the [0, 5 °C] range. We also point to the overwhelming importance of solifluction in shaping hillslopes and transporting soil, and the role of depth-dependent creep (including frost creep) throughout the climatic cycle, whereas the contributions of simple creep and overland flow are minor.

Weed management neither affected the nematode numbers nor their horizontal and vertical distribution and associated root damage. Differences in Radopholus similis (P < 0. 0001), Helicotylenchus spp. (P = 0. 0115) and total nematode populations (P < 0. 0001) were found in roots of different thickness.

The Phase-Contrast Imaging technique is applied during SRM at SYRMEP beamline; this technique is especially suited for imaging objects having low contrast due to X-ray absorption, such as glandular tissue and cancer in mammography. The clinical study demonstrated that the image quality and the diagnostic accuracy increase significantly in SRM compared to conventional mammography. In this study the Entrance Skin Exposure (ESE) and the Mean Glandular Doses (MGDs) delivered during mammographic exams at Elettra and at the University Hospital of Trieste are evaluated and compared. In this study the doses delivered to 73 patients that underwent to a clinical mammographic exam performed with Synchrotron Radiation have been compared to the doses delivered to the same patients in clinical mammography exams using DM. The results show a significant decrease of the Mean Glandular Dose of 42 % in respect to the one delivered at DM. One reason of such important reduction is that in Synchrotron Radiation Mammography the X-ray beam is monochromatic, thus there is no presence of the low energy components of the conventional X-ray spectrum, that are instead completely absorbed by breast during conventional exams. Another interesting and unexpected result is that, in SRM, the ESE is constant in all the <b>thickness</b> <b>classes,</b> with a very important reduction of the skin dose in the thick breast exams (e. g. starting from 5 cm compressed breast, already 58 % lower than DM is observed).

40|$|Groundwater {{recharge}} {{estimates are}} required for water resource management and the investigation of water related hazards and environmental problems. The hydrological processes of recharge are controlled by spatially and temporally distributed characteristics that are both internal (e. g. topography, soil, and land-cover) and external (climate variables). BGS’ field experiments showed that the thickness of low permeability superficial deposit affects {{the amount of water}} and soluble pollutants (such as nitrate) entering the groundwater system. Traditionally, the thickness of superficial drifts on recharge, however, is rarely considered in the recharge estimation. A method was developed in this study to objectively estimate recharge considering the spatial distribution and thickness of low permeability drifts. Based on SLiM method (Wang et al., 2012), recharge in Great Britain was estimated using the information on rainfall intensity, potential evapotranspiration, topography, soil type, crop type, and baseflow index. The drifts were divided into five <b>thickness</b> <b>classes,</b> i. e., 0 – 2 m, 2 m – 5 m, 5 m – 10 m, 10 m – 30 m, and > 30 m. The reduction of recharge for each class was identified based on Monte Carlo simulations. The model was calibrated using the surface water component of observed river flow in 103 river gauging stations in Great Britain. The national daily distributed recharge estimates from 1962 to 2011 were produced. The modelled results have been successfully applied in estimating the nitrate concentration trend in groundwater bodies at the national scale. This national recharge model could be a basis for investigating the impacts of climate changes on groundwater resources. In addition, this method that requires readily available datasets can be easily transferred to other areas.

40|$|In polar regions, sea ice {{strongly}} {{influences the}} momentum and energy transfer between {{the atmosphere and}} the ocean. In order to study mesoscale interactions a nonhydrostatic atmospheric model (METRAS) is coupled to a dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model. The coupled model {{can be used on}} spatial and temporal scales up to 300 km and up to 1 week respectively. In the atmospheric model, the flux averaging method for determining the turbulent surface fluxes is modified by introducing a calculation of the atmospheric form drag of sea ice. With this extension modelled and measured drag and heat transfer coefficients for heterogeneous ice-water-surfaces agree well. Furthermore, drag and heat transfer coefficients for sea ice surfaces and open water surfaces are derived, which can be applied to sea ice or ocean models. The physical processes in the coupled atmosphere - sea ice - model are described in more detail than in other multi-dimensional models used for polar regions. The sea ice model has several ice <b>thickness</b> <b>classes</b> which are especially designed for simulating the development of thin ice and its influence on the heat exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere. The sea ice is vertically devided in several layers and a parametrization of the oceanic form drag of sea ice is included. The coupled model is applied to the Arctic marginal ice zone and a large polynya. The simulations are carried out for Arctic cold air outbreaks. It is shown that considerable changes of the spatial distribution of sea ice in marginal ice zones are likely to occur due to spatially varying ice thicknesses and ice concentrations. On the downwind side of the polynya the near surface wind speed is considerably reduced. For different drift velocities of the sea ice surrounding the polynya, its horizontal extension and, consequently, its influence on the atmosphere decreases. In case of freezing, even a thin layer of new ice homogenizes the atmospheric flow fields considerably. (orig.)

A realistic 3 -D cirrus field is generated by the 3 DCLOUD model (average optical thickness of 1. 4, cloud-top and base altitudes at 10 and 12  km, respectively, consisting of aggregate column crystals of D eff [*]=[*] 20  µm), and 3 -D thermal infrared radiative transfer (RT) is simulated with the 3 DMCPOL code. According to previous studies, differences between 3 -D BT computed from a heterogenous pixel and 1 -D RT computed from a homogeneous pixel are considered dependent at nadir on two effects: (i)  the optical thickness horizontal heterogeneity leading to the plane-parallel homogeneous bias (PPHB) and the (ii)  horizontal radiative transport (HRT) leading to the independent pixel approximation error (IPAE). A single but realistic cirrus case is simulated and, as expected, the PPHB mainly impacts the low-spatial-resolution results (above ∼[*] 250  m) with averaged values of up to 5 – 7  K, while the IPAE mainly impacts the high-spatial-resolution results (below ∼[*] 250  m) with average values of up to 1 – 2  K. A sensitivity study has been performed in order to extend these results to various cirrus optical thicknesses and heterogeneities by sampling the cirrus in several ranges of parameters. For four optical <b>thickness</b> <b>classes</b> and four optical heterogeneity classes, we have found that, for nadir observations, the spatial resolution at which the combination of PPHB and HRT effects is the smallest, falls between 100 and 250  m.

Given E 1 and E 2 moduli of 46 GPa measured for the composite laminate, a 4.6 (210 / 46) multiplier applies to steel thickness losses to obtain the corresponding carbon thickness. The minimum <b>thickness</b> required by <b>Class</b> at the hull position under analysis is 19.6  mm. For the most affected plating, with 11.5  mm of steel remaining, an added 8.1  mm of steel or 37.3  mm of carbon was thus needed.|$|R
40|$|In {{a context}} of high urbanization’s {{pressure}} in rural zones, landscape modelling of erosion opens interesting perspectives in land use planning. In most cases, validation data are the weak point. In this study, we present how fifty years old soil observations can help progressing towards a more accurate validation of such modelling in rural areas. As of 1947, a comprehensive systematic survey of the Belgian soil cover was initiated. Field observations were done every 75 meters by soil auger to a standard depth of 125 cm (if possible). Map units were delineated on cadastral field survey maps at scale 1 : 5, 000, based on auger observations and landscape context, then generalised on the 1 : 10, 000 topographic base map for a publication at 1 : 20, 000 scale. The legend of the map includes more than 6, 000 different soil types and variants. More recently, the Walloon part of this map was digitalised to produce the Digital Soil Map of Wallonia (DSMW). A 10 m resolution DEM was build up in 2009. Its RMSE is 0. 8 m. Soil erodibility and runoff production maps were derived at the same resolution. A land use map exists at 1 : 10, 000 scale since 2005 and is updated yearly. We applied the USPED model (Unit Stream Power - based Erosion Deposition) (Moore and Burch, 1986) in a small watershed where first soil observations took place in 1956. New soil observations were done in 2010. The watershed is completely included in a cultivated area. The model was applied considering a transport capacity limitation proposed by Mitasova and Mitas (1996). Furthermore, we slightly modified it, {{in order to take}} into account recent advances in RUSLE factors computations like LS computation proposed by Desmet and Govers (1996) and Nearing (1997). The spatial distribution of erosion and deposition area produced by the model {{on the basis of the}} current DEM is consistent with a comparison between old and recent pedological observations. Furthermore, a comparison between horizons’ thickness in 1956 and 2010 gives spatially distributed quantitative information on erosion and deposition. Nevertheless, some uncertainties remain since the pedological descriptions are based on <b>thickness</b> <b>classes,</b> due to the variability of soil cartographical units, and since the current DEM is itself affected by an uncertainty on the elevation value. Future research will then focus on more accurate elevation data as starting point and then it will become conceivable to model the evolution of watershed elevation including land use and other local anthropogenic structures like hedgerows, ditches or grass strips.

40|$|A {{consequence}} of the presently hypothesized maintenance of the equatorial wind speed near the cloud top level of Venus by {{a balance between the}} semidiurnal tide's pumping and the Hadley circulation's vertical advection (both integrated across the thermal driving region) is that the maximum equatorial zonal wind speed is proportional to the product of the buoyancy frequency and the magnitude of the driving region's thickness. The proportionality constant is characterized as a weakly increasing function of the heating rate, and a decreasing function of the product of an inverse length, expressing the mean zonal wind shear, and the driving region <b>thickness.</b> For the <b>class</b> of solutions thus treated, there is a threshold heating rate value below which no equilibrium satisfies the prescribed balance...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{coefficient}} of fragmentability {{of a class}} of graphs measures the proportion of vertices {{that need to be}} removed from the graphs in the class in order to leave behind bounded sized components. We have previously given bounds on this parameter for the class of graphs satisfying a given constant bound on maximum degree. In this paper, we give fragmentability bounds for some classes of graphs of bounded average degree, as well as <b>classes</b> of given <b>thickness,</b> the <b>class</b> of k-colourable graphs, and the class of n-dimensional cubes. In order to establish the fragmentability results for bounded average degree, we prove that the proportion of vertices that must be removed from a graph of average degree at most d¯ in order to leave behind a planar subgraph (in fact, a series-parallel subgraph) is at most (d¯- 2) /(d¯+ 1), provided d¯⩾ 4 or the graph is connected and d¯⩾ 2. The proof yields an algorithm for finding large induced planar subgraphs and (under certain conditions) a lower bound {{on the size of the}} induced planar subgraph it finds. This bound is similar in form to the one we found for a previous algorithm we developed for that problem, but applies to a larger class of graphs...|$|R
30|$|The use of {{functional}} appliances for the correction of retrognathic mandible {{is very common}} in orthodontics. Similar appliances known as oral appliances are also frequently used in adults {{for the treatment of}} mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Many studies have reported improvement of pharyngeal airway passage (PAP) dimensions following functional appliance therapy in children and oral appliance therapy in adults. There is only one study in the literature that discussed the effect of oral appliance therapy on posterior pharyngeal wall thickness (PPWT) among subjects with OSA. The effect {{of functional}} appliance therapy on PPWT has never been investigated. Thus the present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of twin-block appliance on pharyngeal airway passage (PAP) dimensions and posterior pharyngeal wall <b>thickness</b> (PPWT) in <b>class</b> II malocclusion subjects with retrognathic mandibles.|$|R
40|$|Harris County, Texas is {{establishing}} a County Asset Management System that will address future financial reporting requirements {{and provide a}} flexible life-cycle-capital reporting methodology for its managed assets. Beginning with its system of roads, Harris County has successfully assessed and inventoried the pavement condition of the network, established a validated network baseline, and determined the variance of the assumptions made for the road infrastructure. The field survey collection proved to be both an affordable and time efficient data collection methodology. A Pavement Condition Survey consisted of gathering roadway inventory and condition data and dovetailing that data with the existing road log database. The compiled result created a comprehensive and usable Geographic Information System (GIS) that facilitates management of the roadway both as a physical entity and as a financial asset. A life-cycle-based valuation model for varying pavement <b>thicknesses</b> by road <b>class</b> was developed and allows for future Governmental Accounting Standards Board compliance, asset management performance based reporting, and strategic asset program planning...|$|R
40|$|A {{class of}} ultrametric Cantor sets (C, d_u) {{introduced}} recently in literature (Raut, S and Datta, D P (2009), Fractals, 17, 45 - 52) {{is shown to}} enjoy some novel properties. The ultrametric d_u is defined using the concept of relative infinitesimals and an inversion rule. The associated (infinitesimal) valuation {{which turns out to}} be both scale and reparametrisation invariant, is identified with the Cantor function associated with a Cantor set C̃ where the relative infinitesimals are supposed to live in. These ultrametrics are both metrically as well as topologically inequivalent compared to the topology induced by the usual metric. Every point of the original Cantor set C is identified with the closure of the set of gaps of C̃. The increments on such an ultrametric space is accomplished by following the inversion rule. As a consequence, Cantor functions are reinterpretd as (every where) locally constant on these extended ultrametric spaces. An interesting phenomenon, called growth of measure, is studied on such an ultrametric space. Using the reparametrisation invariance of the valuation it is shown how the scale factors of a Lebesgue measure zero Cantor set might get deformed leading to a deformed Cantor set with a positive measure. The definition of a new valuated exponent is introduced which is shown to yield the fatness exponent {{in the case of a}} positive measure (fat) Cantor set. However, the valuated exponent can also be used to distinguish Cantor sets with identical Hausdorff dimension and <b>thickness.</b> A <b>class</b> of Cantor sets with Hausdorff dimension _ 3 2 and thickness 1 are constructed explicitly.

40|$|ObjectivesSchneiderian {{membrane}} perforation {{is one of}} {{the main}} complications during sinus augmentation. The reasons may be associated with surgical technique, septum, inadequate ridge height, and membrane thickness. However, reports that used cone‐beam computed tomography (CBCT) to quantify the thickness of sinus membrane were limited. The aims of this retrospective study were: to study the correlation between membrane thickness and perforation rate during transcrestal sinus lift and to propose a classification system of sinus membrane thickness based upon CBCT data. Material and methodsOne hundred and twenty‐two subjects who received dental implant restorations over posterior maxilla with a total of 185 transcrestal sinus lift procedures between years 2010 to 2013 were selected consequently. Each patient selected had to have taken CBCT in the initial examination and immediately after surgery. The membrane thickness, perforation rate, residual bone height, and elevated bone height were recorded and processed for statistical analysis. ResultsThe mean thickness of the Schneiderian membrane was 1. 78  ±  1. 99  mm. There was a significant correlation between membrane thickness and perforation rate (P <  0. 05), and the perforation rate was higher in thicker (≥ 3  mm) and thinner membrane (≤ 0. 5  mm). Among the <b>thickness</b> group, <b>Class</b> B (between ≥ 1 and < 2  mm) had the lowest perforation rate. No significant difference was between the perforation and the membrane morphology. A negative relationship between residual bone height and membrane thickness was found. Trend showed that in the thicker and the thinner residual bone height, the higher the perforation rate would be. ConclusionsThere was a significant correlation between membrane thickness and perforation rate. The perforation rate was lowest when the thickness was 1. 5 – 2  mm...|$|R
