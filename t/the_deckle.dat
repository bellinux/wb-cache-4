Two twelve-hour shifts ensured non-stop production, with around 140 prisoners working. The printed sheets, each containing four notes, were dried and cropped using a steel ruler; the edges were roughened to imitate <b>the</b> <b>deckle</b> finish of the British notes. The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six flat-bed printing presses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wooden frame}} {{is called a}} [...] "deckle". <b>The</b> <b>deckle</b> leaves {{the edges of the}} paper {{slightly}} irregular and wavy, called [...] "deckle edges", one of the indications that the paper was made by hand. Deckle-edged paper is occasionally mechanically imitated today to create the impression of old-fashioned luxury. [...] The impressions in paper caused by the wires in the screen that run sideways are called [...] "laid lines" [...] and the impressions made, usually from top to bottom, by the wires holding the sideways wires together are called [...] "chain lines". Watermarks are created by weaving a design into the wires in the mould. [...] Handmade paper generally folds and tears more evenly along the laid lines.|$|E
50|$|Before the 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>deckle</b> edge was unavoidable, {{a natural}} {{artifact}} of the papermaking {{process in which}} sheets of paper were made individually on a deckle. <b>The</b> <b>deckle</b> could not make a perfect seal against the screen at the edges and the paper slurry would seep under, creating a rough edge to the paper. <b>The</b> <b>deckle</b> edge could be trimmed off, but this extra step would add {{to the cost of}} the book. Beginning in the early 1800s with the invention of the Fourdrinier machine, paper was produced in long rolls and <b>the</b> <b>deckle</b> edge became mostly obsolete; although there was some deckle on the ends of the rolls, it was cut off, and the individual sheets cut out from the roll would have no deckle in any case.|$|E

25|$|The Bluebird 810 {{was sold}} in export markets as the Datsun 160B, Datsun 180B, Datsun 200B and Datsun 810. Australian {{magazine}} Wheels called the 200B 'a 180B with 20 more mistakes.' In Japan the range gradually received upgraded motors which could pass the 1978 emissions standards; these models carry 811 series chassis numbers, with Japanese market vehicles were installed with a NAPS badge on <b>the</b> rear <b>deckled</b> that identified emission control technology having been installed. This process began in October 1977 and continued until August 1978. This meant replacing the earlier L-series engines with the new crossflow Z engines, based on the L.|$|R
50|$|A {{deckled edge}} {{is also a}} feathery, {{unfinished}} paper edge. Many fine art works, and hand-made, fine art finished, or digital prints <b>deckle</b> <b>the</b> paper edge. Again, as in book printing, this was once considered an imperfection as the byproduct of hand-made paper-making. Now makers use it to create the appearance of greater value.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{appearance}} of smooth edges in the 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>deckle</b> edge slowly emerged as a status symbol. Many 19th-century presses advertised {{two versions of the}} same book: one with edges trimmed smooth and a higher-priced deckle version, which suggested the book was made with higher-quality paper, or with more refined methods. This tradition carried forward into the 20th and 21st centuries. [...] modern deckle is produced by a purpose-built machine to give {{the appearance}} of a true deckle edge by cutting a smooth edge into patterns. Many modern readers are unfamiliar with <b>the</b> <b>deckle</b> edge and may see it as a defect; for example, Amazon.com has left notes to buyers that <b>the</b> <b>deckle</b> is not a flaw in the product. A deckle edge is unrelated to the practice of unopened pages, in which a reader must cut open pages with knife.|$|E
5000|$|In manual papermaking, a deckle is a {{removable}} wooden frame or [...] "fence" [...] placed into a mould {{to keep the}} paper slurry within bounds and to control {{the size of the}} sheet produced. After the mold is dipped into a vat of paper slurry, excess water is drained off and <b>the</b> <b>deckle</b> is removed and the mold shaken or [...] "couched" [...] to set the fibers of the paper. Some of the paper slurry passes under <b>the</b> <b>deckle</b> and forms an irregular, thin edge.|$|E
50|$|In film processing, deckles are die inserts {{that set}} the coating width of a slot die coater or the {{extrusion}} width of an extrusion die. They work by constraining the flow as the material exits the die. Since some materials {{have a tendency to}} neck in or spread out after leaving the die, workers may need to adjust <b>the</b> <b>deckle</b> position to achieve target width.|$|E
5000|$|Hesse’s {{interest}} in latex {{as a medium}} for sculptural forms {{had to do with}} immediacy. Keats states, [...] "immediacy {{may be one of the}} prime reasons Hesse was attracted to latex". Hesse’s first two works using latex, Schema and Sequel (1967-68) use latex in a way never imagined by the manufacturer. [...] "Industrial latex was meant for casting. Hesse handled it like house paint, brushing layer upon layer to build up a surface that was smooth yet irregular, ragged at <b>the</b> edges like <b>deckled</b> paper." ...|$|R
