5|$|The {{blue whale}} rose from {{relative}} obscurity in the 1970s, {{after the release}} of the Songs of the Humpback Whale. The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was not well known to most people, who conflated the species in <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b> <b>To</b> many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> <b>to</b> new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E
5|$|Unhappy in {{the estate}} agency, Kingsbury took up the {{position}} of caretaker on a farm at Boundary Bend, {{not far from where}} Avery was working. After three months, the pair decided that they would go on an adventure – walking through western Victoria and New South Wales. In February 1936, Kingsbury and Avery left their jobs and began travelling north, working on various farms and estates. The pair eventually arrived in Sydney several months later, and returned to Melbourne on the first train back. Kingsbury resumed working as a real estate agent, while Avery worked as a nurseryman. They spent their free time at dances and parties. During this time, Kingsbury met and became close to Leila Bradbury. As the war in Europe escalated, Kingsbury and Avery made up <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> <b>to</b> enlist. Despite his parents' disapproval, Kingsbury signed up to the Australian Imperial Force on 29 May 1940.|$|E

To buy her a gift, they create a plan to rob a train, but instead steal money from the Russo family and make their escape aboard the Flying Pussyfoot express train. There, they befriend gangsters Jacuzzi Splot and Nice Holystone and the immortal boy Czeslaw Meyer. They tell {{the legend of the}} Rail Tracer, a monster that eats train passengers, causing Jacuzzi to leave in a panic. Shortly after, the train is hijacked and they escape in the confusion. Later, the duo {{discover}} the conductors' mutilated bodies. Believing that the story of the Rail Tracer has come true, they assume Jacuzzi has also been eaten, only to discover otherwise. Isaac and Miria make up <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> <b>to</b> ask the Rail Tracer to leave, oblivious to the seriousness of the situation and how dangerous the Rail Tracer is. They find Czeslaw's body underneath the train in their search for the monster. When trying to rescue him, Isaac cuts himself, revealing their immortality to Czeslaw. Believing they are trying to devour him, the boy decides to devour them first, but changes his mind after they rescue him and promise to be his family. After the train arrives in Manhattan, they realize they never bought Ennis a present and tell her their gift is Czeslaw, who will be her younger brother.|$|E

500|$|A report {{published}} in the American magazine Time a fortnight later described the incident as [...] "a genuine horror story, calculated {{to make the most}} alarming of Rhodesian doomsday prophecies seem true."

The prominent Indian-Rhodesian Gulab family was particularly affected by the incident, having lost eight members in the attack. Though Rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash, doing so only after four days' investigation, the truth was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours. Smith wrote in his memoirs that the [...] "degree of anger... difficult to control". White South Africans were similarly enraged, particularly after reports appeared in the South African press that the killers had raped the female passengers before massacring them. A Friends of Rhodesia Society in South Africa offered a reward of R100,000 to anybody who would either kill Nkomo or bring him to Salisbury to stand trial.|$|E

Throughout the game, the staff decided to use a blue sky in cutscenes to represent Zack, while other features in such scenes are meant to symbolize his connections. A number of Zack's actions from the game were also designed so as to augment the similarities that Aerith finds between him and Cloud in Final Fantasy VII. Zack and Cloud's connection was also meant to be expanded upon near the game's ending, {{with both of them}} planning to flee to Midgar. However, due to limitations in the console's hardware, these scenes could not be implemented, and instead, they decided to focus on Zack's role as a warrior.|$|E
