5|$|The {{northern}} part of the county is known as <b>the</b> <b>barrens,</b> named by <b>the</b> early settlers for the lack timber there. For the first decades of settlement, settlers refused to purchase the land in <b>the</b> <b>barrens</b> because it was considered too far from the timber needed to build homes, fires, fences, and other necessities. <b>The</b> <b>barrens</b> were swept by annual wildfires that prevented the growth of trees. <b>The</b> largest <b>barren</b> ran from <b>the</b> northern edge of Corydon northward to Palmyra, and from the Floyd Knobs in the east, westward to the Blue River. <b>The</b> Central <b>Barren</b> covered most of the upper middle part of the county. As settlement expanded and farming grew in the early 19thcentury, settlers began to discover that <b>the</b> <b>barrens</b> were among <b>the</b> most fertile farmlands in the state, and they quickly filled up with landholders. As settlement increased, the wildfires were stopped and by the start of the 20thcentury the uninhabited parts of <b>the</b> <b>barrens</b> had become forested and have remained so until modern times.|$|R

5|$|Splash dams, greased chutes, {{railroad}} landings, railroad {{branch lines}} and steam donkey operations {{were among the}} strategies utilized to exploit the watershed's resources of timber. Unfortunately, railroad embankments and fills used to build up tributaries had artificially straightened them in the process, and erosion increased dramatically on <b>the</b> <b>barren</b> hillside, causing many streams to become much siltier than they naturally would be. Nearly all the old-growth forest in the watershed is now gone, and the forests that remain are mostly second-growth stands.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>barren</b> desert {{surface of}} Ceti Alpha V was {{simulated}} on stage 8, the largest sound stage at Paramount's studio. The set was elevated 25 {{feet off the}} ground and covered in wooden mats, over which tons of colored sand and powder were dumped. A cyclorama was painted and wrapped around the set, while massive industrial fans created a sandstorm. The filming was uncomfortable for actors and crew alike. The spandex environmental suits Koenig and Winfield wore were unventilated, and the actors had to signal by microphone when they needed air. Filming equipment was wrapped in plastic to prevent mechanical troubles and everyone on set wore boots, masks, and coveralls as protection from flying sand.|$|E

5|$|The lower {{areas of}} the {{wilderness}} area are covered by a taiga forest of Scots pine. Less common trees include downy birch, goat willow, aspen and rowan. Logging {{in the past has}} mostly occurred in the southern part ("Kessi"), a large proportion of Vätsäri's forests being old-growth forests. <b>The</b> <b>barren</b> soil makes for poor growth conditions and most of the ground vegetation in the forests is subshrubs. One area with limestone rock features green spleenwort. The reserve is located in an area between a western and eastern vegetation zones, giving rise to unique combinations of species, such as Siberian spruce and red cottongrass.|$|E
5|$|As with so {{many other}} parts of the myth, the {{resolution}} is complex and varied. Often, Horus and Set divide the realm between them. This division can be equated with any of several fundamental dualities that the Egyptians saw in their world. Horus may receive the fertile lands around the Nile, the core of Egyptian civilization, in which case Set takes <b>the</b> <b>barren</b> desert or the foreign lands that are associated with it; Horus may rule the earth while Set dwells in the sky; and each god may take one of the two traditional halves of the country, Upper and Lower Egypt, in which case either god may be connected with either region. Yet in the Memphite Theology, Geb, as judge, first apportions the realm between the claimants and then reverses himself, awarding sole control to Horus. In this peaceable union, Horus and Set are reconciled, and the dualities that they represent have been resolved into a united whole. Through this resolution, order is restored after the tumultuous conflict.|$|E
5|$|Fuseli created {{two other}} works {{depicting}} the Three Witches for a Dublin art gallery in 1794. The first, entitled Macbeth, Banquo and the Three Witches was a frustration for him. His earlier paintings of Shakespearean scenes {{had been done}} on horizontal canvases, giving the viewer {{a picture of the}} scene that was similar to what would have been seen on stage. Woodmason requested vertical paintings, shrinking the space Fuseli had to work with. In this particular painting he uses lightning and other dramatic effects to separated Macbeth and Banquo from the witches more clearly and communicate how unnatural their meeting is. Macbeth and Banquo are both visibly terrified, while the witches are confidently perched atop a mound. Silhouettes of the victorious army of Macbeth can be seen celebrating in the background, but lack of space necessitates the removal of <b>the</b> <b>barren,</b> open landscape seen in Fuseli's earlier paintings for the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery of the same scene.|$|E
40|$|Distinct barrens {{and forest}} {{vegetation}} types grow {{in close proximity}} on the Pocono Plateau of northeastern Pennsylvania. This study investigated whether organic chemicals produced by ericaceous shrubs in <b>the</b> <b>barrens</b> inhibit <b>the</b> growth of forest tree species. Germination of Betula populifolia (Gray birch, Marshall, Betulaceae) and Tsuga canadensis, (Eastern hemlock, L., Pinaceae) were not inhibited by aqueous extracts of barrens leaf litter or organic soil. Activated carbon applied to tree seedlings planted in <b>the</b> <b>barrens</b> and forest reduced mortality of Acer rubrum (Red maple, L., Aceraceae), Prunus serotina (Black cherry, Ehrh., Rosaceae), and Betula lenta (Sweet birch, L., Betulaceae) in <b>the</b> <b>barrens</b> {{but not in the}} forest. It increased the growth of Acer and Prunus seedlings in <b>the</b> <b>barrens,</b> but did not increase their growth in the forest. Organic chemicals that were absorbed by activated carbon in this experiment may contribute to the persistence of distinct forest and barrens vegetation types. These chemicals may reduce nutrient availability in <b>the</b> <b>barrens,</b> contributing to <b>the</b> continued dominance of ericaceous shrubs that are adapted to low nutrient conditions...|$|R

5|$|Major-General Hunter's flying column set {{out from}} Kassinger, a small town {{a few miles north}} of Merowe, at five-thirty the evening of July 29, marching only at night so as to avoid both the heat of the sun and the eyes of any Mahdist lookouts. There was no road or path to follow, and the terrain upon which Hunter's flying column marched was nearly nontraversable; the route alternated between broken, rocky ground and ankle-high sand, {{ultimately}} proving extremely difficult to navigate in the dark of night. Added to these difficulties was the measure of speed imposed upon the column, as the mounted Major-General Hunter and Lieutenant MacDonald drove their units to their breaking points in order to preempt Mahdist reinforcements. The column advanced until midnight, completing a march of over sixteen miles. Sleeping during the day was made impossible by the sweltering heat; only when adequate shade was found in <b>the</b> <b>barren</b> desert could the exhausted men of Hunter's flying column rest.|$|E
5|$|The Prometheus {{lands on}} <b>the</b> <b>barren,</b> mountainous surface near a large, {{artificial}} structure, which a team explores. Inside, they find stone cylinders, a monolithic {{statue of a}} humanoid head, and the decapitated corpse of a large alien, thought to be an Engineer; Shaw recovers its head. The crew finds other bodies, leading them to surmise the species is extinct. Crew members Millburn and Fifield grow uncomfortable with the discoveries and attempt to return to Prometheus, but become stranded in the structure when they get lost. The expedition is cut short when a storm forces the crew {{to return to the}} ship. David secretly takes a cylinder from the structure, while the remaining cylinders begin leaking a dark liquid. In the ship's lab, the Engineer's DNA is found to match that of humans. David investigates the cylinder and the liquid inside. He intentionally taints a drink with the liquid and gives it to the unsuspecting Holloway, who had stated he would do anything for answers. Shortly after, Shaw and Holloway have sex.|$|E
5|$|While Ismail, who {{remained}} head of Perfini, went abroad to study cinematography at the School of Theater, Film and Television at the University of California, Los Angeles, Djajakusuma began taking {{a larger role}} in Perfini. He made his directorial debut in 1952 with Embun (Dewdrop), which showed the psychological troubles faced by soldiers upon returning to their village after the revolution. The film was shot in Wonosari, at the time {{in the middle of a}} drought, to provide a visual metaphor for <b>the</b> <b>barren</b> souls of the warriors. Because of its depiction of traditional superstitions, the film had trouble with both the censorship bureau and critics; superstition was considered incompatible with the new republic's need for modernisation. The release of Embun made Djajakusuma one of four directors to work for Perfini; the others were Ismail, Nya Abas Akup, and Wahyu Sihombing.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Harrison County <b>barrens</b> were {{so named}} by the early {{settlers}} {{for the lack of}} timber coverage. They were large tracts of prairie-like land, with only grass and small bushes. For the first decades of settlement, no one would live on <b>the</b> <b>barrens</b> because they were considered too far from the timber needed to build homes, fires, fences, and other necessities. <b>The</b> <b>barrens</b> were also swept by annual field fires, which would burn off most of the growth. As settlement expanded and farming grew in the early nineteenth century, settlers began to discover that because of <b>the</b> fires, <b>the</b> <b>barrens</b> were among <b>the</b> most fertile farmlands in the state, and they quickly filled with landholders. As settlement increased, the settlers were able to stop and prevent the wild fires that hindered forest growth and by the start of the 20th century, much of <b>the</b> <b>barrens</b> that were uninhabited began to grow up in Forrest, as it has remained until modern times.|$|R

5|$|Alexander the Great's {{conquest of}} the Achaemenid Empire in 332 BC {{introduced}} Hellenistic culture to the Middle East. After Alexander's death in 323 BC, his empire split among his generals and in the end, much {{of the land of}} modern-day Jordan was disputed between the Ptolemies based in Egypt and the Seleucids based in Syria. In the south and east, the Nabataeans had an independent kingdom. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who derived wealth from their capital Petra, whose proximity to major trade routes led to it becoming a regional trading hub. Campaigns by different Greek generals aspiring to annex the Nabataean Kingdom were unsuccessful. The Ptolemies were eventually displaced from the region by the Seleucid Empire. The conflict between these two groups enabled the Nabataeans to extend their kingdom northwards well beyond Petra in Edom. The Nabataeans are known for their great ability in constructing efficient water collecting methods in <b>the</b> <b>barren</b> desert and their talent in carving structures into solid rocks — notably the Khazneh (treasury). These nomads spoke Arabic and wrote in Nabataean alphabets, which were developed from Aramaic script during the 2nd century BC, and are regarded by scholars to have evolved into the Arabic alphabet around the 4th century AD.|$|E

5000|$|The {{frightening}} {{reputation of}} <b>the</b> Pine <b>Barrens</b> may indeed {{have contributed to}} the Jersey Devil legend; historically, <b>the</b> Pine <b>Barrens</b> were considered inhospitable land, and gangs of highwaymen, such as the Pine Robbers, were known to rob and attack travelers passing through <b>the</b> <b>Barrens.</b> During <b>the</b> 1700s and 1800s, residents of <b>the</b> isolated Pine <b>Barrens</b> were deemed <b>the</b> dregs or outcasts of society: poor farmers, fugitives, brigands, Native Americans, poachers, moonshiners, runaway slaves, and deserting soldiers. Pineys have sometimes fostered certain frightening stories about themselves and <b>the</b> Pine <b>Barrens</b> to discourage outsiders or intruders from entering <b>the</b> <b>Barrens.</b> Pineys were further demonized and vilified after two eugenics studies during the early 20th century, which depicted Pineys as congenital idiots and criminals, as seen in the research performed on [...] "The Kallikak Family" [...] by Henry H.

40|$|To compare {{adjacent}} post oak flatwoods and barrens {{communities in}} south-western Indiana, we used vegetational, environmental and fire history data in multivariate analyses. Barrens had greater dominance by post oak and lower tree species richness, but variation in tree species composition was not {{strongly related to}} soil moisture, litter depth or other environmental gradients measured. Tree growth has been slow and variable, with little difference between <b>the</b> <b>barrens</b> and flatwoods. Barrens and flatwoods differ in herb species composition, but with considerable overlap. In <b>the</b> <b>barrens,</b> herbaceous vegetation composition was correlated with tree basal area, litter depth and soil moisture; in the flatwoods, it was correlated with soil moisture and microelevation. <b>The</b> <b>barrens</b> and flatwoods differed only slightly but significantly in environment: barrens soils were drier in June 1986 than flatwoods soils. Data from fire-scarred trees show no clear evidence of differences in frequency or extent of fire between <b>the</b> flatwoods and <b>barrens.</b> Multistemmed post oaks in <b>the</b> <b>barrens</b> indicate that past cutting {{may have contributed to}} these openings within the closed canopy flatwoods matrix...|$|R
