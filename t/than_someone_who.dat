500|$|Author Bob Perelman {{takes the}} {{suspicion}} of empiricism {{one step further}} in his 1994 The Trouble With Genius: Reading Pound, Joyce, Stein, and Zukofsky. Perelman discusses the parable as one of two anecdotes in ABC of Reading that frame Pound's discussion of Chinese ideograms. The former describes attendance at two hypothetical concerts: one of Debussy and another of Ravel. Pound states {{that a person who}} attended both concerts knows more about the composers <b>than</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> has only read [...] "ALL of the criticisms that have ever been written of both". Perelman considers the contradiction between [...] "everyone" [...] and [...] "knowledge" [...] to be the key to Pound's thinking: only a gifted or lucky few are able to apprehend the truth (whether by attending the concert or observing the specimen); the rest can only make do with [...] "a fog of clichés, received ideas, second-hand and second-rate opinions, written darkness." [...] With regard to the parable, Perelman observes the lack of [...] "scientific institutions, pedagogic procedures, or communicable terminologies" [...] where any mediating written descriptions ("sunfish", [...] "diplodokus") only serve to obscure knowledge. Knowledge ultimately resides within Agassiz rather than the world, and [...] "hat looks initially like a commitment to empiricism has led instead to an authoritarian idealism." ...|$|E

They briefly mention those famous entrepreneurs, like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg who were college dropouts, but they call these cases all but exceptional, as it is a pattern that many entrepreneurs view formal education as costly, mainly because of the time that needs to be spent on it. Michelacci and Schivardi believe that in order for an individual to reach the full success they need to have education beyond high school.

2500|$|Binding {{angle is}} defined by the degrees off of {{perpendicular}} from the length of the snowboard. A binding angle of 0° is when the foot is perpendicular to the length of the snowboard. Positive angles are pointed towards the front of the board, whereas negative angles are pointed towards the back of the board. The question of how much the bindings are angled depends on the rider's purpose and preference. Different binding angles can be used for different types of snowboarding. Someone who participates in freestyle competition would have a much different [...] "stance" [...] <b>than</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> explores backcountry and powder. The recent advancement and boom of snowboard culture and technology has made binding angle adjustments relatively easy. Binding companies design their bindings with similar baseplates that can easily mount onto any type of snowboard regardless of the brand. With the exception of Burton, and their newly released [...] "channel system", adjusting bindings is something that remains constant among all snowboarders. Done with a small screw-driver or a snowboard tool, the base plates on bindings can be easily rotated to whatever preferred stance. One must un-screw the baseplate, pick their degree angles, and then re-screw the baseplates. Bindings should also regularly be checked to ensure that the screws don't come undone from the movements of snowboarding.|$|E
2500|$|Nowadays, the {{education}} of craftspersons has changed - in particular self-esteem {{and the concept of}} respectability. Yet even today, a craftsperson does sometimes refer to the [...] "craftspersons codex of virtues" [...] and the crafts sometimes may be referred to as the [...] "virtuous crafts" [...] and a craftsperson who gives a blessing at a roofing ceremony may, in many cases, remind of the [...] "virtues of the crafts I am part of". Also certain virtues are ascribed to certain crafts. For example, a person might be called [...] "always on time like a bricklayer" [...] to describe punctuality. On the other hand, [...] "virtue" [...] and [...] "respectability", which in the past had been the center of the life of any craftsperson became less and less important for such education. Today, a young person who wants to start an apprenticeship must first find an [...] "Ausbilder": this may be a master craftsperson, a master in the industrial sector (Industriemeister) or someone else with proof of suitable qualifications in the training of apprentices. The [...] "Ausbilder" [...] must also provide proof of no criminal record and proof of respectability. The Ausbilder has to be at least 24 years of age. The Ausbilder has several duties, such as 1) teach the craft, 2) teach the techniques, 3) instill character, 4) instill social skills. In some cases, the Ausbilder must also provide board and lodging. Agreement is reached on these points before the apprenticeship begins. The apprentice will also receive payment for his work. According to §17 Berufsbildungsgesetz, a first year apprentice will be paid less <b>than</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> has been an apprentice for longer. An Ausbilder who provides board and lodging may set this off against the payment made. In the past, many of those who applied for an apprenticeship had only primary school education. Nowadays, only those with secondary school education apply for apprenticeships because secondary school attendance has become compulsory. In some trades, it has even become difficult for those holding the Hauptschulabschluss to find an apprenticeship because more and more pupils leave school with the Realschulabschluss or Abitur. The apprenticeship takes three years. During that time, the apprentice is trained by the Ausbilder and also attends a vocational school.
