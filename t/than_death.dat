5|$|Before {{they were}} {{destroyed}} in the Revolution, {{the remains of the}} king and queen lay in the mortuary chamber below. Catherine's effigy suggests sleep rather <b>than</b> <b>death,</b> while Henry is posed strikingly, with his head thrown back. From 1583, Pilon also sculpted two later gisants of Catherine and Henry wearing their crowns and coronation robes. In this case, he portrays Catherine realistically, with a double chin. These two statues were intended to flank the altar of the chapel. Pilon's four bronze statues of the cardinal virtues stand at the corners of the tomb. Pilon also carved the reliefs round the base that recall Bontemps' work on the monument for the heart of Francis I.|$|E

25|$|Applying {{the test}} to Washington's case, the Court {{concluded}} that counsel {{did not perform}} deficiently and that Washington suffered no prejudice. The counsel's decision to focus on remorse and emotional distress was a reasonable strategic decision {{in light of the}} trial judge's stated views on remorse, the heinousness of Washington's crimes, and Washington's own statements to counsel. In view of those considerations, the Court could not conclude that additional mitigating evidence would have given rise to a reasonable probability that the trial judge would have sentenced Washington to life in prison rather <b>than</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E

25|$|En {{route to}} the Kyln, an intergalactic prison, Thanos meets Death, who {{for the first time}} speaks to the Titan. Death claims to be worth wooing, but says Thanos must offer {{something}} other <b>than</b> <b>death.</b> At the Kyln Thanos encounters Peter Quill, also known as Star-Lord, and the Shi'ar warrior Gladiator, who are both prisoners, and the Beyonder, who has been rendered amnesiac by its choice to assume a humanoid female form. Thanos battles the Beyonder, causing its mind to shut down and leaving its power trapped within a comatose physical form. Thanos then instructs the Kyln officers to keep the Beyonder on life support indefinitely in order to prevent the entity from being reborn. Thanos departs the Kyln in the company of Skreet, a chaos-mite freed from the prison. Thanos then meets the Fallen, revealed to be the true first Herald of Galactus. Thanos defeats the former Herald and places him under complete mental control. He later appears in Wisconsin attempting to charge a weapon called the Pyramatrix with the life force of everyone on Earth until he is defeated by Squirrel Girl. After the battle, Uatu the Watcher appears and confirms to Squirrel Girl that she defeated the real Thanos, not a clone or copy.|$|E

500|$|Vonnegut was {{an admirer}} of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, {{particularly}} the Beatitudes, and incorporated it into his own doctrines. He also referred to it in many of his works. In his 1991 book Fates Worse <b>than</b> <b>Death,</b> Vonnegut suggests that during the Reagan administration, [...] "anything that sounded like the Sermon on the Mount was socialistic or communistic, and therefore anti-American". In Palm Sunday, he wrote that [...] "the Sermon on the Mount suggests a mercifulness that can never waver or fade." [...] However, Vonnegut had a deep dislike for certain aspects of Christianity, often reminding his readers of the bloody history of the Crusades and other religion-inspired violence. He despised the televangelists of the late 20th century, feeling that their thinking was narrow-minded.|$|E
500|$|With {{political}} combat {{reaching a}} fever pitch, the Committee {{introduced a bill}} to establish a newer version of the [...] "Law of Suspects" [...] – the Law of 22 Prairial. With it, a new category of [...] "enemies of the people" [...] was established in terms so vague that virtually anyone could be accused. Defendants were not permitted legal counsel and the Revolutionary Tribunal was instructed to impose no sentence other <b>than</b> <b>death.</b> The bill was swiftly shepherded into law by Robespierre, and although Saint-Just was not directly involved in its composition, he was certainly supportive.

The second day of these deliberations began on November 6, 2010. Attorney Thomas Ullman told the jury that a sentence of life in prison would be the harshest possible punishment for his client Hayes, {{because he was so}} tormented by his crimes and would be isolated in prison. [...] "Life in prison without the possibility of release is the harshest penalty," [...] Ullman said. [...] "It is a fate worse <b>than</b> <b>death.</b> If you want to end his misery, put him to death," [...] he added. [...] "If you want him to suffer and carry that burden forever, the guilt, shame, and humiliation, sentence him to life without the possibility of release." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{difference}} between using linen, rather than leather is that linen soaks easily, and the inhabitants will drown, whereas a watertight leather sack will effect {{death by suffocation}} {{due to lack of}} air (or death by a drawn-out drowning process, relative to a comparatively quick one), rather <b>than</b> <b>death</b> by drowning. In a 1548 case from Dresden, the intention was to suffocate the culprit (who had killed his mother), rather than drown him. With him into the leather sack was a cat and a dog, and the sack was made airtight by coating it with pitch. However, the sack chosen was too small, and had been overstretched, so as the sack hit the waters after being thrown from the bridge, it ripped open. The cat and the dog managed to swim away and survive, while the criminal (presumably bound) [...] "got his punishment rather earlier than had been the intention", that is, death by drowning instead.|$|E
