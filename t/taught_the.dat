More recently, Asian elephants have demonstrated an ability to perform basic arithmetic.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{reports on}} {{quasi-experimental}} research. The aims {{of this research}} were to examine: 1) which model of cooperative learning (TAI or STAD) is suitable for improving student learning outcomes; 2) whether the learning outcomes of mathematics students who have a visual learning style <b>taught</b> by <b>the</b> TAI type model is better than when they are <b>taught</b> with <b>the</b> STAD model; 3) whether the learning outcomes of mathematics students who have an auditory learning style <b>taught</b> by <b>the</b> TAI type model are better than when they are <b>taught</b> with <b>the</b> STAD model; 4) whether the learning outcomes of mathematics students who have a kinaesthetic learning style <b>taught</b> by <b>the</b> TAI type model are better than when they are <b>taught</b> with <b>the</b> STAD model; and 5) whether the learning outcomes of students who have a visual learning style are better than for students with an auditory or kinaesthetic learning style. The results of the learning outcomes of mathematics by students who were <b>taught</b> by <b>the</b> TAI and STAD cooperative learning model types show {{that there are no}} significant differences in terms of the visual, auditory and kinaesthetic learning styles...|$|R

5|$|According to Pat Southern, principes {{appear to}} have been born from {{remnants}} of the old second class of the army under the Etruscan kings when it was reformed by Marcus Furius Camillus. The second class stood in some of the first few ranks of a very large phalanx and were equipped in a similar manner to principes. They would support the heavier first class in the front ranks. It is probable that engagements with the Samnites and a crushing defeat {{at the hands of the}} Gallic warlord Brennus, who both used lots of smaller military units rather than a few very large ones, <b>taught</b> <b>the</b> Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy.|$|E
5|$|All {{apprentices}} were to {{be educated}} in reading, writing and arithmetic {{for the first four}} years of their apprenticeship. The Act specified that this should be done every working day within usual working hours but did not state how much time should be set aside for it.

Every Sunday, for one hour, apprentices {{were to be}} <b>taught</b> <b>the</b> Christian religion; every other Sunday, a divine service should be held in the factory, and every month the apprentices should visit a church. They should be prepared for confirmation in the Church of England between the ages of 14 and 18 and must be examined by a clergyman at least once a year. Male and female apprentices were to sleep separately and not more than two per bed.|$|E
