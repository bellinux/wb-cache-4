5|$|Just {{because an}} SSD {{supports}} <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> command {{does not necessarily}} mean {{it will be able to}} perform at top speed immediately after a TRIM command. The space which is freed up after <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> command may be at random locations spread throughout the SSD. It will take a number of passes of writing data and garbage collecting before those spaces are consolidated to show improved performance.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>TRIM</b> command {{also needs}} {{the support of}} the SSD. If the {{firmware}} in the SSD does not have support for <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> command, the LBAs received with <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> command will not be marked as invalid and the drive will continue to garbage collect the data assuming it is still valid. Only when the OS saves new data into those LBAs will the SSD know to mark the original LBA as invalid. SSD Manufacturers that did not originally build TRIM support into their drives can either offer a firmware upgrade to the user, or provide a separate utility that extracts the information on the invalid data from the OS and separately TRIMs the SSD. The benefit would be realized only after each run of that utility by the user. The user could set up that utility to run periodically in the background as an automatically scheduled task.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{benefit of}} <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> command {{depends upon the}} free user space on the SSD. If the user {{capacity}} on the SSD was 100GB and the user actually saved 95GB of data to the drive, any TRIM operation would not add more than 5GB of free space for garbage collection and wear leveling. In those situations, {{increasing the amount of}} over-provisioning by 5GB would allow the SSD to have more consistent performance because it would always have the additional 5GB of additional free space without having to wait for <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> command to come from the OS.|$|E
5000|$|Man {{is using}} {{electric}} trimmer to cut hedges around exterior of home. Trimmer is plugged into outlet on exterior of home 75 feet from where man is working. <b>The</b> <b>trimmer</b> switch {{is locked in}} the [...] "on" [...] position and in normal use. Extending {{beyond the reach of}} the trimmer's power cord, the plug is accidentally pulled from the outlet on the house 75 feet away. The man puts down <b>the</b> <b>trimmer,</b> switch still locked in the [...] "on" [...] position, and walks with his back away from <b>the</b> <b>trimmer</b> towards <b>the</b> outlet. A 4-year-old boy playing nearby sees <b>the</b> <b>trimmer</b> on <b>the</b> ground and approaches it. He picks it up with both hands.

50|$|When the {{percentage}} of points to discard does not yield a whole number, <b>the</b> <b>trimmed</b> mean may be defined by interpolation, generally linear interpolation, between the nearest whole numbers. For example, {{if you need to}} calculate <b>the</b> 15% <b>trimmed</b> mean of a sample containing 10 entries, strictly this would mean discarding 1 point from each end (equivalent to <b>the</b> 10% <b>trimmed</b> mean). If interpolating, one would instead compute <b>the</b> 10% <b>trimmed</b> mean (discarding 1 point from each end) and <b>the</b> 20% <b>trimmed</b> mean (discarding 2 points from each end), and then interpolating, in this case averaging these two values. Similarly, if interpolating <b>the</b> 12% <b>trimmed</b> mean, one would take the weighted average: weight <b>the</b> 10% <b>trimmed</b> mean by 0.8 and <b>the</b> 20% <b>trimmed</b> mean by 0.2.|$|R

The {{number of}} non-zero {{elements}} of <b>the</b> <b>trimmed</b> matrix is 1104 for 1995 and 1135 for 2005, while {{that for the}} input coefficient matrix without trimming is 6321 for 1995 and 6326 for 2005. For each year, {{the sum of all}} elements of <b>the</b> <b>trimmed</b> matrix is about 84 % of the sum of all elements of <b>the</b> matrix without <b>trimming,</b> while <b>the</b> number of non-zero elements of <b>the</b> <b>trimmed</b> matrix is considerably smaller than that of <b>the</b> matrix without <b>trimming.</b> Therefore, it can be observed that <b>trimming</b> effectively highlights <b>the</b> essential features of production structures.|$|R

5|$|Even {{after the}} OS and SSD are {{configured}} to support <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> command, other conditions might prevent any benefit from TRIM. , databases and RAID {{systems are not}} yet TRIM-aware and consequently will {{not know how to}} pass that information on to the SSD. In those cases the SSD will continue to save and garbage collect those blocks until the OS uses those LBAs for new writes.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> command resolves this problem for operating systems that support it like Windows 7, Mac OS (latest releases of Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion, patched in some cases), FreeBSD since version 8.1, and Linux since version 2.6.33 of the Linux kernel mainline. When a file is permanently deleted or the drive is formatted, the OS sends <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> command {{along with the}} LBAs that no longer contain valid data. This informs the SSD that the LBAs in use can be erased and reused. This reduces the LBAs needing to be moved during garbage collection. The result is the SSD will have more free space enabling lower write amplification and higher performance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—One of the {{purposes}} of the robust method of estimation is to reduce the influence of outliers in the data, on the estimates. The outliers arise from gross errors or contamination from distributions with long tails. <b>The</b> <b>trimmed</b> mean is a robust estimate. This means that it is not sensitive to violation of distributional assumptions of the data. It is called an adaptive estimate when <b>the</b> <b>trimming</b> proportion is determined from the data rather than being fixed a “priori’. The main objective {{of this study is to}} find out the robustness properties of <b>the</b> adaptive <b>trimmed</b> means in terms of efficiency, high breakdown point and influence function. Specifically, it seeks to find out the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>trimming</b> proportion of <b>the</b> adaptive <b>trimmed</b> mean which will yield efficient and robust estimates of the parameter for data which follow a modified Weibull distribution with parameter λ = 1 / 2, where <b>the</b> <b>trimming</b> proportion is determined by...|$|R

5|$|The SSD {{controller}} {{will use}} any free blocks on the SSD for garbage collection and wear leveling. The {{portion of the}} user capacity which is free from user data (either already TRIMed or never written in the first place) will look the same as over-provisioning space (until the user saves new data to the SSD). If the user saves data consuming {{only half of the}} total user capacity of the drive, {{the other half of the}} user capacity will look like additional over-provisioning (as long as <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> command is supported in the system).|$|E
5|$|The third {{source of}} over-provisioning comes from known free {{space on the}} drive, gaining {{endurance}} and performance {{at the expense of}} reporting unused portions, and/or at the expense of current or future capacity. This free space can be identified by the operating system using <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> command. Alternately, some SSDs provide a utility that permit the end user to select additional over-provisioning. Furthermore, if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100% of the available space, that unpartitioned space will be automatically used by the SSD as over-provisioning as well. Yet another source of over-provisioning is operating system minimum free space limits; some operating systems maintain a certain minimum free space per drive, particularly on the boot or main drive. If this additional space can be identified by the SSD, perhaps through continuous usage of <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> command, then this acts as semi-permanent over-provisioning. Over-provisioning often takes away from user capacity, either temporarily or permanently, but it gives back reduced write amplification, increased endurance, and increased performance.|$|E

40|$|The Swedish dairy {{production}} today {{consists of}} big farms and different housing systems are in use. These systems put {{demands on the}} cows’ {{ability to cope with}} the environment and one challenge is the claw health in the herds. Some claw lesions that are frequently observed are foot rot, hemorrhages, digital dermatitis and sole ulcers, which can be caused by, for example, the claws’ environment and the flooring type used. The flooring type decides how great the wear is and how the wear pattern will be. Too great wear results in a thinner more sensitive sole while a too small wear causes overgrowth, which increases the pressure on local spots. Both of these wear patterns results in an increased risk of claw lesions and to decrease this risk, routine claw <b>trimming</b> is performed. <b>The</b> number of trimmings a year varies from trimming when needed up to three times a year (recommendations state twice a year). The purpose of <b>the</b> <b>trimming</b> is to redirect the pressure to the claw’s wall, which is the strongest part. This is achieved by <b>trimming</b> <b>the</b> claw to a correct angle and by dishing out some of the medial sole. Claw trimming have many proved positive effects, but a possible problem with lameness caused by <b>the</b> <b>trimming</b> process has also been noticed. This was considered in need of an investigation and this study has focused on <b>the</b> <b>trimming</b> process, what factors that could be causing the lameness and if there really is a problem. This was achieved by studying cows locomotion on three farms before and after <b>trimming,</b> <b>the</b> <b>trimming</b> was also observed to notice factors that could affect the locomotion. The possible factors involved in affecting the cows’ locomotion after trimming are many and are at a high proportion connected to the handling of the cows during <b>the</b> <b>trimming.</b> Some of these factors were found to be slippery floors which caused strains as well as crush or break injuries caused by the restraining of the claws in <b>the</b> <b>trimming</b> chutes. <b>The</b> lameness was found to be, in many cases, a product from treated claw lesions, however not all cows that were treated for claw lesions became lame and cows that were not affected with claw lesions also suffered from a decreased locomotion after <b>the</b> <b>trimming.</b> <b>The</b> locomotion was found to be significantly affected by <b>the</b> <b>trimming</b> and it remains to investigate which factors are causing this One factor of particular interest for further research is break injuries due to the restraining of the front claws to <b>the</b> <b>trimming</b> chutes, which was observed as a swelling at the joint after <b>the</b> <b>trimming.</b> A significant connection between poor locomotion and decreased milk yield could not be found but there was a tendency towards this and a greater data set is needed to establish this...|$|R
