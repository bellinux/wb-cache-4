40|$|Ride {{safety of}} a tracked vehicle is the key focus of this research. The factors that affect the ride {{safety of a}} vehicle are {{analyzed}} and evaluation parameters with their criteria are proposed. A multibody cosimulation approach is used to investigate the effects of hydropneumatic parameters on the ride safety and aid with design optimization and tuning of the suspension system. Based on the cosimulation environment, the vehicle multibody dynamics (MBD) model and the road model are developed using RecurDyn, which {{is linked to the}} hydropneumatic suspension model developed in Lab AMESim. Test verification of a single suspension unit is accomplished and the suspension parameters are implemented within the hydropneumatic model. Virtual tests on a G class road at different speeds are conducted. Effects of the accumulator charge pressure, damping diameter, and the <b>track</b> <b>tensioning</b> pressure on the ride safety are analyzed and quantified. This research shows that low accumulator charge pressure, improper damping diameter, and insufficient <b>track</b> <b>tensioning</b> pressure will deteriorate the ride safety.

50|$|Under {{the newer}} A27M specification, Cromwell {{integrated}} {{a number of}} new and advanced features.

The tank was prone to throwing its tracks if <b>track</b> <b>tension</b> was not maintained properly or if it turned at too high a speed or too sharply. There were also some problems with suspension breakage, partly due to the Cromwell's high speed. Cromwell ran through a number of design changes as a result.|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for a}} Two-Span Web Roller machine is defined {{in order to facilitate}} motion planning, motion tracking and state observer design for <b>tracking</b> web <b>tension</b> and web velocity. Differential Flatness is utilized to create reference trajectories that are tracked with a high convergence rate. Flatness also allows for nominal input torque generation without integration. Constraints on the inputs are satisfied through the motion planning phase. A partial state feedback linearization is performed and an exponential tracking dynamic feedback controller is defined. An exponential Kalman-related tension observer is also defined with semi-optimal gain formulation. The observer takes advantage of the bilinearity of the dynamics up to additive output nonlinearity. The closed-loop system is simulated in MatLab with comparisons to reference trajectories previously employed in literature.
