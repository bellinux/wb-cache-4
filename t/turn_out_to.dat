5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front {{part of the body}} is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E

Both the opening and closing ceremonies took place at Cardiff Arms Park, plus all the track and field events, on what had been the greyhound track.

5|$|In general, {{the term}} duality {{refers to a}} {{situation}} where two seemingly different physical systems <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the success, the Massachusetts {{provisional}} government agreed to organize an expedition on a larger scale against Quebec, the capital of New France, and gave its command to Phips. Originally intending to coordinate with a simultaneous overland attack on Montreal launched from Albany, New York, the expedition's departure was delayed in the vain hope that needed munitions would arrive from England. The expedition, counting 34 ships and more than 2,000 soldiers, finally sailed on August 20. It was short on ammunition, had no pilots familiar with the Saint Lawrence River, and carried what would <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be inadequate provisions.|$|E

5|$|Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of {{the sperm}} or egg, which {{manifest}} in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, {{which is likely to}} be more important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts. Organisms do not want to mutate: mutation just happens. Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very small minority <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{important}} {{mathematical constant}} , sometimes called Euler's number, is approximately equal to 2.718 {{and is the}} base of the natural logarithm. Although exponentiation of e could, in principle, be treated the same as exponentiation of any other real number, such exponentials <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> have particularly elegant and useful properties. Among other things, these properties allow exponentials of e to be generalized in a natural way to other types of exponents, such as complex numbers or even matrices, while coinciding with the familiar meaning of exponentiation with rational exponents.|$|E

5|$|The {{irreducible}} infinite-dimensional unitary representations {{may have}} indirect relevance to physical reality in speculative modern theories since the (generalized) Lorentz group appears {{as the little}} group of the Poincare group of spacelike vectors in higher spacetime dimension. The corresponding infinite-dimensional unitary representations of the (generalized) Poincaré group are the so-called tachyonic representations. Tachyons appear in the spectrum of bosonic strings and are associated with instability of the vacuum. Even though tachyons may not be realized in nature, these representations must be mathematically understood {{in order to understand}} string theory. This is so since tachyon states <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> appear in superstring theories too in attempts to create realistic models.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sites of}} copper {{accumulation}} are {{the liver and}} the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. People with liver problems tend to come to medical attention earlier, generally as children or teenagers, than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, {{who tend to be}} in their twenties or older. Some are identified only because relatives have been diagnosed with Wilson's disease; many of these, when tested, <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The mirror {{symmetry}} {{relationship is}} a particular example of what physicists call a duality. In general, the term duality refers to a situation where two seemingly different physical theories <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be equivalent in a nontrivial way. If one theory can be transformed so it looks just like another theory, the two {{are said to be}} dual under that transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena. Such dualities {{play an important role in}} modern physics, especially in string theory.|$|E

30|$|Our {{main results}} can be {{summarized}} as follows. In spite of our assumption that coercive power {{can be seen to}} bring order and discipline into the relationship as well as be effective in changing behavior, the effects of coercive power <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be negative on both coordination and cooperation. According to our assumptions, reward power should {{have a negative effect on}} cooperation and a positive effect on coordination. Expert power <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> have positive effects on coordination and cooperation. The effects of informational power are similar to the effects of expert power, though the effect in the case of informational power on cooperation is much weaker than that of expert power. According to the findings, the effects of legitimate power <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be positive for coordination and negative for cooperation. One must admit, though, that in spite of the positive sign of the effect on coordination, the strength of this effect <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be weak. Referent power <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> have a positive effect on both coordination and cooperation.|$|R
