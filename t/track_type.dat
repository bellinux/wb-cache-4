Although similar in concept to the wired movies feature released as part of QuickTime 3.0, QuickTime interactive was much more ambitious.

A special <b>track</b> <b>type</b> was added that contained an interpreter for a custom programming language based on 68000 assembly language. This supported a comprehensive user interaction model for mouse and keyboard event handling based in part on the AML language from the Apple Media Tool.|$|E
2500|$|Most railroads {{with heavy}} traffic use {{continuously}} welded rails supported by sleepers attached via base plates that spread the load. A plastic or rubber pad is usually placed between the rail and the tie plate where concrete sleepers are used. The rail is usually held down to the sleeper with resilient fastenings, although cut spikes are widely used in North American practice. For much of the 20th century, rail track used softwood timber sleepers and jointed rails, and a considerable extent of this <b>track</b> <b>type</b> remains on secondary and tertiary routes. The rails were typically of flat bottom section fastened to the sleepers with dog spikes through a flat tie plate in North America and Australia, and typically of bullhead section carried in cast iron chairs in British and Irish practice. [...] The London, Midland and Scottish Railway pioneered the conversion to flat-bottomed rail and the supposed advantage of bullhead rail - that the rail could be turned over and re-used when the top surface had become worn - {{turned out to be}} unworkable in practice because the underside was usually ruined by fretting from the chairs.|$|E

40|$|The Early Cretaceous (Valanginian–Barremian) Broome Sandstone of the Dampier Peninsula, Western Australia, {{has often}} been touted as {{having one of the}} most diverse dinosaurian ichnofaunas in the world. Yet with the {{exception}} of tracks assigned to the theropodan ichnotaxon Megalosauropus broomensis in 1967, and more recent work on the preservational characteristics of sauropodan tracks, descriptive accounts of the <b>types</b> of dinosaurian <b>tracks</b> that occur in the Broome Sandstone have been limited, with reports ranging from 6 – 16 different ichnotaxa. As such, the overall scientific significance of the ichnofauna has remained enigmatic. At the request of Goolarabooloo Traditional Custodians, 300 + hours of ichnological survey work was undertaken on the 25 km stretch of coastline in the vicinity of Walmadany (James Price Point) from 2011 – 2013. 48 discrete tracksites were identified in this area, containing upward of 20 <b>track</b> <b>types</b> referable to theropods, sauropods, ornithopods and thyreophorans. Around half of <b>track</b> <b>types</b> can be formally assigned to known and new ichnotaxa, while the remainder represent informal but distinctive morphotypes. All the tracksites occur in the same type of horizon, and the relative level of diversity of the main <b>track</b> <b>types</b> across areas where tracksites are concentrated is comparable. Although the tracks of sauropods are the most abundant, those of large bipedal ornithopods and likely stegosaurian thyreophorans are also well represented...|$|R
