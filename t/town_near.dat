5|$|Little is {{recorded}} about Charlton's early life, {{as he grew}} up in a relatively unknown mining district.

5|$|The group {{began to}} expand its {{activities}} in 1946. The initial expansion within South Asia happened immediately after the partition of India in 1947, when the Pakistan Chapter {{was established in the}} hinterlands of Raiwind <b>town</b> <b>near</b> Lahore, Pakistan. The Pakistan Chapter remained the largest till Bangladesh became independent from Pakistan in 1971. Today, the largest Chapter is Bangladesh followed by the second largest in Pakistan. Within two decades of its establishment, the group reached Southwest and Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. The Tablighi Jamaat's aversion to politics, and also its lack of any direct and practical economic-political-social viewpoints, like the occupation of Palestine, helped it enter and operate in societies, especially western countries and societies where politically active religious groups faced restrictions.|$|E
