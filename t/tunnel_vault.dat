25|$|A barrel vault, {{also known}} as a <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault</b> or a wagon vault, is an {{architectural}} element formed by the extrusion of a single curve (or pair of curves, {{in the case of a}} pointed barrel vault) along a given distance. The curves are typically circular in shape, lending a semi-cylindrical appearance to the total design. The barrel vault is the simplest form of a vault: effectively a series of arches placed side by side (i.e., one after another). It is a form of barrel roof.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after St Niklaus station, {{the next}} rack section starts. This leads {{up to the}} Blattbachtunnel, a 130 metre long {{avalanche}} protection structure erected in 1931. The original uncovered stretch of line at this point had to be abandoned, as the railway bridge over the Blattbach had been destroyed many times by avalanches and flooding since it was first constructed. To circumvent the problem area, a <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault</b> was created in open cut form, and then covered with earth. At the same time, and by the same means, the exit of the third rack rail section could be protected from bad weather.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} kind of vault is {{the barrel}} vault (also called a wagon or <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault),</b> {{which is generally}} semicircular in shape. The barrel vault is a continuous arch, the length being greater than its diameter. As in building an arch, a temporary support is needed while rings of voussoirs are constructed and the rings placed in position. Until the topmost voussoir, the keystone, is positioned, the vault is not self-supporting. Where timber is easily obtained, this temporary support is provided by centering consisting of a framed truss with a semicircular or segmental head, which supports the voussoirs until the ring of the whole arch is completed. With a barrel vault, the centering can then be shifted on to support the next rings.|$|E
50|$|This {{church is}} located {{alongside}} Göreme-Avanos road {{at a distance}} of 2.5 km leaving from Göreme. The church's narthex is missing. It has <b>tunnel</b> <b>vaults,</b> a high nave and 3 apses. It dates back to 964-965 AD.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} next to the {{entrance}} hall contains the Lending Library. Above it is the Reference Library Reading Room, whose space includes the first floor and two tiers of galleries. It is <b>tunnel</b> <b>vaulted,</b> with glass above.|$|R
50|$|Roman Maritime Archeological Villa - It {{was most}} {{probably}} {{built in the}} first century BC at sea level. One of the best preserved elements of the villa is the large hall with <b>tunnel</b> <b>vaults,</b> stucco, and the remains of frescos.|$|R
500|$|The east range itself {{runs the}} length of {{the east side of the}} castle, and {{originally}} comprised a large hall, with a square tower house at the north-east corner. Although only the basement survives, this once formed one of the finest noble residences of its time in Scotland, and would have been similar to the contemporary buildings at Doune Castle. The basement is a single <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault,</b> with low walls subdividing the area into stores. Two large ovens and a well lie at the south end, while at the east is the 13th-century postern, blocked when the wall was thickened to support the new buildings above, and re-used as a fireplace. At the north end of the basement is a vaulted prison for freemen, and below this, a rock-cut pit, [...] square, to house prisoners of the peasant classes. Above the prison, but still within the basement, is a vaulted chapel with various ceremonial recesses, such as a sacristy and a piscina, or water basin. A private chamber for the priest is next door. The hall above is [...] by , and once had a high timber roof, and a minstrel's gallery at the south end. An ornately carved stone buffet, or cupboard, is located on this wall, which formed part of the servery next to the kitchen. At the north-east corner of the castle, a tower house provided accommodation for the Lord's family and guests. Again, only the lowest floor remains, above the chapel. This probably formed a private chamber for the Lord, and was connected to the adjacent hall.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{entrance}} crosses a corridor and leads into the Concert Hall. This measures [...] by [...] and is [...] high. The roof is a <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault</b> carried on columns of polished red granite. The walls have niches for statues and the panelled plasterwork of the vault has allegorical figures of Virtues, Science and Arts. The highly decorated floor consists of Minton tiles {{and it is}} usually covered by a removable floor to protect it. It contains over 30,000tiles. The doors are bronze and have openwork panels which incorporate the letters SPQL (the Senate and the People of Liverpool) making an association with the SPQR badge of ancient Rome.|$|E
2500|$|The Crown Court has a <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault</b> on red granite {{columns and}} the Civil Court a coved ceiling on grey granite columns. The south {{entrance}} is approached through the portico, {{is low and}} has Ionic columns. Below this is a larger vaulted space which was adapted {{to form a new}} entrance in 2003–05. The north entrance hall has Doric columns on its landing and a Doric ambulatory around the apse. A copy of part of the Parthenon frieze runs round its walls. In the entrance is a statue of Henry Booth by Theed the Younger. The Small Concert Room is almost circular and is lavishly decorated. In the past it was known as the Golden Concert Room and it was regularly host to Charles Dickens, who held many of his readings there. [...] A balcony supported by caryatids runs round the room. At the back of the platform are attached columns, decorated with arabesques, supporting a frieze with griffins and between the columns are mirrors. [...] The concert room was refurbished between 2000 and 2007. This included making alterations to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act, restoring the historical painting scheme and restoring the chandelier, which consists of 2,824crystal pieces. [...] It has seating for an audience of 480.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} is rich but austere. It is a single-nave space with <b>tunnel</b> <b>vaults</b> (in {{a pattern of}} stars, hearts and rosettes). The high altar is of the late Renaissance style (first half of the 17th century), made of black, red, brown, dark green marble, decorated with white alabaster; side altars are rococo (18th century).|$|R
50|$|The Hoffman kiln was {{the last}} major {{development}} on the site and {{is believed to have}} been built around 1900, along with additional tramways and rail track. The kiln, which is exceptionally well preserved, measures around 44.8 xx 17.5 m and has two <b>tunnel</b> <b>vaults</b> entered through 14 round-headed arches. The chimney, a local landmark, stands on a plinth and is around 42.5 m high.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 1400 meters east of {{the palace}} stand {{the remains of the}} mosque at Qusayr al-Hallabat. Small in scale, it {{measures}} 10.70 by 11.80 meters and is constructed of layered limestone. Inside, two arching riwaqs divide the mosque into three sections. A rounded molding extends the perimeter of the space at the height of 2.10 meters. Similar to Qusayr 'Amra and Hammam as-Sarah, three <b>tunnel</b> <b>vaults</b> support the roof of the structure. Encircling the mosque from the north, west, and east stood a 3.30-meter wide portico.|$|R
2500|$|Barrel {{vaulting}} {{was known}} and utilized by early civilizations, including Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. However, it apparently {{was not a}} very popular or common method of construction within these civilizations. The Persians and the Romans were the first to make significant architectural use of them. The technique probably evolved out of necessity to roof buildings with masonry elements such as bricks or stone blocks in areas where timber and wood were scarce. The earliest known example of a vault is a <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault</b> found under the Sumerian ziggurat at Nippur in Babylonia, ascribed to about 4000 BC, which was built of burnt bricks amalgamated with clay mortar. The earliest tunnel vaults in Egypt are found at Requagnah and Denderah, from around 3500 BC in the predynastic era. These were built with sun-dried brick in three rings over passages descending to tombs: in these cases, as the span of the vault was only two metres. In these early instances, the barrel vault was chiefly used for underground [...] structures such as drains and sewers, though several buildings of the great Late Egyptian mortuary palace-temple of Ramesseum were also vaulted in this way. Recent archaeological evidence discovered at the Morgantina site (in the province of Enna) shows that the aboveground barrel vault was known and used in Hellenistic Sicily in 3rd Century BC, indicating that the technique was also known to Ancient Greeks.|$|E
2500|$|But, {{for some}} reason or other, an open-timbered hammer beam roof was not wanted, {{probably}} a decision made from the first, since the trusses are spaced to suit the existing vault exactly. Jackson was therefore instructed to prepare {{a model for the}} new roof, for which he received £20, and he accordingly designed a fan-vaulted ceiling, of wood and plaster, to be put up [...] beneath the old hammer-beam roof, and securely fixed to it. And very ingeniously he did it. The points of the hammerbeams gave him the line for his pendents, the great feature of the later fan-vaulted roofs. From these the ribs of the vaulting spring, and between them he shaped his ceiling in the ordinary way, after the manner of that at Windsor, for example. The hammer-beams themselves gave him a springing for short, low pitched tunnel vaults, running north and south, to connect the wall above the window heads {{with the rest of his}} vaulting. These are stepped, so to speak, and in two levels. If he had run his <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault</b> through at one level, the crown of it would have run out high above the head of the windows, and necessitated a gable over each window. The hammer-beams and the brackets below them are left to show below the new vault, and are ingeniously worked into the design. All the rest of the old roof is up above, and out of sight. The effect of the whole is successful, and not out of keeping with the windows. A glance at the photograph of the interior will explain the arrangement, which is very difficult to make clear with words only. The design is almost identical with that of the stone vault over the Choir of the Cathedral, the great stone bracket pieces there taking the place of the hammer-beam supports, while the tunnel vaults run through at one level.|$|E

5000|$|The high dome {{illuminates}} the choir and directs the eye toward the high altar, which {{takes up the}} entire width of the choir. The cathedral interior creates a [...] "sweeping spacial unity", unlike the Baroque churches constructed in the Tyrol up to that time, which consisted of a <b>tunnel</b> <b>vaulted</b> nave of elongated multi-sectioned rooms with rows of chapels and galleries lining both sides. Herkomer rejected this partitioned design approach, {{and for the first}} time in the province, created an expansive interior with a spacial unity directed toward the domed choir and high altar.|$|R

50|$|Designed by Victor Prus & André G. Dionne, it is {{a normal}} side {{platform}} station built in tunnel. The central mezzanine, built within the <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault,</b> gives access to three entrances on three corners {{at the intersection of}} Sherbrooke Street East and Langelier Boulevard.|$|E
5000|$|The caravanserai was {{constructed}} {{on the former}} trade road between Adana and Aleppo. It {{is an example of}} a type known as [...] "caravansearai without a courtyard". It is a rectangular building with 45,75 X 23,60 m2 dimensions (or 150 x 77 ft2) The entrance is via east. The vaults are <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault</b> type.|$|E
50|$|Inside, the {{basement}} is the <b>tunnel</b> <b>vaulted</b> {{lower part of}} the tower. At the east end of this is a corrugated iron air raid shelter. Upstairs is the chapel proper, with plastered walls, a timber roof, and Gothic Revival fittings. Originally the walls were decorated with stencilling. There are heraldic crests in stained glass of the Selby family. The walls at the east end are inscribed with quotations from the Psalms. Flanking the altar are statues of Mary and Joseph. The Stations of the Cross are represented by photographs. The stained glass in the east window is attributed to William Wailes, and depicts the Crucifixion.|$|R
5000|$|Like Telfords Craigellachie Bridge, Mythe Bridge {{was cast}} by William Hazledine, and {{is similar in}} form to Telfords Galton Bridge, which spans the Birmingham Canal at Smethwick. It has six cast iron ribs, each cast in 23-foot (7m) lengths, with {{spandrels}} filled with X-shaped bracing. Telford described the iron as [...] "best Shropshire iron, commonly called No. 2". The arch rises 17 feet (5.2m), one tenth of the span. The X-bracing carries the diagonal crossed bracing to the spandrels beneath the beam, {{as well as to}} the carriageway and balustrade. The abutments at either end of the bridge houses a group of six <b>tunnel</b> <b>vaults</b> with pointed arches and stone quoins. These are separated by the attached colonnettes.|$|R
5000|$|Inside the church, {{the nave}} has a waggon roof, while the chancel is <b>tunnel</b> <b>vaulted.</b> The arcades are of {{different}} design, one {{is supported by}} cylindrical piers, the other is on clustered colonnettes. The transept is occupied by the organ. The interior {{of the church is}} decorated with wall paintings. These include depictions of saints on the south wall of the chancel, and stencilled designs on the ceilings of the aisles. The pulpit is also highly decorated, with mosaic panels, and there is also mosiac in the reredos. The west window and in the windows of the apse contain stained glass. [...] The glass in the apse was designed by Hardman & Co.|$|R
50|$|The {{auditorium}} has two curved cantilevered balconies {{with large}} overhangs each holding 500 seats. Either {{side of the}} stage are stacked boxes between pairs of fluted Corinthian columns. The high proscenium arch is decorated with a circular medallion flanked by gryphons. The high ceiling above the auditorium {{takes the form of a}} coffered segmental <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{interior}} {{contains the}} former General Office {{on the ground}} floor which, because of the steel frame, is free from any columns. Above this, the former Board Room has a <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault.</b> Both rooms are decorated with stucco in 17th-century style. [...] The building is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5000|$|St Mungo's {{dates from}} the late 12th century, and the chancel was added in the 13th century. [...] The {{architectural}} historian Nikolaus Pevsner was {{of the opinion that}} the Norman features, including the south door and some windows, date from about 1170-90, and that the <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault</b> in the lowest stage of the tower is also from this period or [...] "a little later". The north aisle was added by C. J. Ferguson in 1882.|$|E
50|$|Inside {{the church}} are <b>tunnel</b> <b>vaults</b> {{on three sides}} with a {{segmental}} arcade carried on square columns; this forms an ambulatory. The roof is flat and trabeated, with pyramidal acoustic panels. The floor is in terrazzo, with the sanctuary area raised and in marble. A stone altar slab stands on three steps, and is flanked by a font and a pulpit. There are pews on three sides of the sanctuary. The organ is in a raised position above the entrance. Around the church are Stations of the Cross by Adam Kossowski. The stained glass is by Gounil and Philip Brown. Wall paintings behind the altar date from the 1990s. The pipe organ has two manuals, and was made by Rushworth and Dreaper.|$|R
50|$|The Dark Gate (or {{alternatively}} Dark Portal, Hungarian: Sötétkapu) is {{a tunnel}} located under the artificial slopes of Castle Hill near St. Adalbert's Basilica in Esztergom, Hungary.The tunnel is 90 metres long and follows {{the line of}} the castle's former eastern walls. The entire <b>tunnel</b> is <b>vaulted</b> and built in Neo-classical style.|$|R
50|$|It {{was made}} up of five khirbets, {{including}} Khirbat al-Dayr where lie the ruins of St. Brocardus monastery and a cave complex with <b>vaulted</b> <b>tunnels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Before it was rebuilt in 1820, {{the chapel}} {{appears to have}} been late 13th century. The {{extensive}} rebuilding was carried out to designs by John Biagio Rebecca (c.1777-1847), a decorative painter and architect, who also built Castle Goring and worked at Penshurst Place c.1818. As part of the reworking, the Sidney Chapel received an elegant pointed <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault,</b> panelled and painted, and with carved bosses on the ribs. The tunnel-vaulted ceiling with its many heraldic shields was restored in 1966.|$|E
5000|$|The north {{aisle and}} tower, and the crypt under the chancel, {{date back to}} the early 14th century and are the oldest {{remaining}} parts of the church, followed by the south aisle and then the early 15th-century nave. [...] The clerestory and roof are from 1506-1523, and the former screen, now by the north tower, Jacobean of 1620. The chancel was rebuilt in 1743 by Nathaniel Ireson for Sir Charles Berkeley as a shallow <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault</b> with Rococo styling, another unexpected note.|$|E
50|$|A barrel vault, {{also known}} as a <b>tunnel</b> <b>vault</b> or a wagon vault, is an {{architectural}} element formed by the extrusion of a single curve (or pair of curves, {{in the case of a}} pointed barrel vault) along a given distance.

50|$|The {{station was}} {{designed}} by Irving Sager. Two steel murals by Robert Savoie, entitled Kawari Kabuto, grace {{the walls of the}} great volume over the <b>tunnel</b> <b>vaults,</b> and a mural in the pedestrian tunnel to the northern entrances is by Jean-Paul Mousseau. The southern rotunda formerly contained a multimedia installation entitled Ars Natura, promoting Montreal's science museums.The most famous artwork, however, is one of Hector Guimard's art nouveau entrance porticos from the Paris Métro. One of the few authentic installations on a rapid transit station outside Paris, it was given in 1967 by the RATP (Régie autonome des transports parisiens) to commemorate the collaboration of French and Canadian engineers in building the Metro. It is located within Victoria Square on the Saint Antoine entrance, one of only four open-air entrances on the network (the others are located at Place-Saint-Henri and Bonaventure stations). It was recently removed, completely restored, and reinstalled.|$|R
50|$|Hallsteinn Sigurðsson (born 1945) is an Icelandic {{sculptor}} {{and visual}} artist. He is noted for his Nordic god sculptures, {{some of which}} are located at the Laxá Power Station in the north central part of the country and are arranged in the facility’s <b>tunnels</b> and <b>vaults.</b> Some twenty five of his sculptures are exhibited in the Gufunes sculpture park in north-east Reykjavík.|$|R
50|$|The station's roof is {{a single}} span wrought iron truss {{structure}} 550 ft long with a span of 210 ft, and was 90 ft high at its apex above the railtracks. Glass covered the middle section, timber (inside) and slate (outside) covered the outer quarters. The end screens were glazed with timber boarding surrounding the outer edges. It was constructed by Andrew Handyside and Co. The substructure and masonry partition were provided by Robert Neill and Sons of Manchester. Underneath the train shed is a large brick undercroft with intersecting <b>tunnel</b> <b>vaults,</b> above which were six platforms above street level which exited the station onto viaducts and bridges. The undercroft was used for storage and connected to the adjacent goods sidings by a carriage lift. The station's two-storey south wall has 15 bays separated by brick pilasters. At ground-floor level the bays have three round-headed windows and at first-floor level three square-headed. In the 20th century a glazed canopy was erected at the entrance at north end.|$|R
