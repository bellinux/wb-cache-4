40|$|Background: Mechanical torque {{limiting}} devices (MTLDs) are necessary tools {{to control a}} peak torque and achieving target values of screw component of dental implants. Due to probable effect of autoclaving and number of use on the accuracy of these devices, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of sterilization and number of use on the accuracy of friction-style mechanical {{torque limiting}} devices (F-S MTLDs) in achieving their <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> values. Materials and Methods: Peak torque measurements of 15 new F-S MTLDs from three different manufacturers (Astra Tech, BioHorizons, Dr. Idhe) were measured ten times before and after 100 steam sterilization using a digital torque gauge. To simulate the clinical situation of aging (number of use) <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> application process was repeated 10 times after each sterilization cycle and the peak torque values were registered. Comparison of the mean differences with <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> in each cycle was performed using one sample t test. Considering the type of MTLDs as inter subject comparison, One-way repeated measure ANOVA {{was used to evaluate}} the absolute values of differences between devices of each manufacturer in each group (α = 0. 05). Results: The results of this study in Dr. Idhe group showed that, mean of difference values significantly differed from the <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> (P = 0. 002) until 75 cycles. In Astra Tech group, also mean of difference values with under estimation trend, showed a significant difference with the <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> (P < 0. 001). Mean of difference values significantly differed from the <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> with under estimation trend during all the 100 cycles in BioHorizons group (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: The torque output of each individual device stayed in 10 % difference from <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> values before 100 sterilization cycles, but more than 10 % difference from the <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> was seen in varying degrees during these consequent cycles...|$|E

40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the effect of steam sterilization on the accuracy (within 10 %) of friction-style mechanical torque limiting devices (F-S MTLDs) to achieve their <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> values. Materials and Methods: Fifteen new F-S MTLDs were selected from Astra Tech (25 Ncm, Hader SA, La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland), BioHorizons (30 Ncm, Dynatorq ITL, Irvine, California, USA), Dr. Idhe (15 - 60 Ncm, Dr. Idhe Dental, Eching/Munich, Germany). Every peak torque measurement was tested ten times before steam sterilization using Tohnichi torque gauge (6 Tohnichi-BTG (-S), Japan). Steam sterilization was performed using a 100 cycle autoclave. Preparation steps were carried out for the devices before each autoclave sterilization cycle. Peak torque measurements were repeated after every sterilization cycle. Mean difference between the measured and the targeted torque values were evaluated before and after aging. Repeated-measures of ANOVA were {{used to compare the}} differences of accuracy between subjects. Bonferroni post-hoc test was used for pairwise comparison. Results: Autoclaving resulted in an increase in the error values (the difference between peak torque and <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> values) in all the three groups studied (P 10 % (maximum 12 %) difference from their torque values in 5 % of the measurements. Conclusion: Steam sterilization effect differs between <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> and measured peak values with an increase trend. The peak torque values showed a significant decrease for BioHorizons, while a significant increase was noted for Astra Tech and no significant change in Dr. Idhe group after sterilization. Clinical Implication: Within the limitation of this study the torque output of each individual device deviated in varying degrees from <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> values. However, the majority of the new frictional-style devices tested in this study, delivered fairly consistent torque output within 10 % of their preset target values after sterilization. Astra Tech devices were the only one showing more than 10 % difference from their torque values in 5 % of the measurements.

Currently, there is limited information on the steam sterilization influence on the accuracy of MTDs. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of steam sterilization on the accuracy (&plusmn; 10 % of the <b>target</b> <b>torque)</b> of spring-style mechanical torque devices for dental implants. Materials and methods: Fifteen new S-S MTDs and their appropriate drivers from three different manufacturers (Nobel Biocare, Straumann [ITI], and Biomet 3 i [3 i]) were selected. Peak torque of devices (5 in each subgroup) was measured before and after autoclaving using a Tohnichi torque gauge. Descriptive statistical analysis was used and a repeated-measures ANOVA with type of device as a between-subject comparison was performed to assess the difference in accuracy among the three groups of spring-style mechanical torque devices after sterilization. A Bonferroni post hoc test was used to assess pairwise comparisons. Results: Before steam sterilization, all the tested devices stayed within 10 % of their target values. After 100 sterilization cycles, results didn&# 39;t show any significant difference between raw and absolute error values in the Nobel Biocare and ITI devices; however the results demonstrated an increase of error values in the 3 i group (P &lt; 0. 05). Raw error values increased with a predictable pattern in 3 i devices and showed more than a 10 % difference from <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> values (maximum difference of 14 % from <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> was seen in 17 % of peak torque measurements).

40|$|Reaching {{to visual}} targets engages {{the nervous system}} {{in a series of}} transformations between sensory {{information}} and motor commands. That which remains to be determined {{is the extent to which}} the processes that mediate sensorimotor adaptation to novel environments engage neural circuits that represent the required movement in joint-based or muscle-based coordinate systems. We sought to establish the contribution of these alternative representations to the process of visuomotor adaptation. To do so we applied a visuomotor rotation during a center-out isometric torque production task that involved flexion/extension and supination/pronation at the elbow-joint complex. In separate sessions, distinct half-quadrant rotations (i. e., 45 �) were applied such that adaptation could be achieved either by only rescaling the individual joint torques (i. e., the visual <b>target</b> and <b>torque</b> <b>target</b> remained in the same quadrant) or by additionally requiring torque reversal at a contributing joint (i. e., the visual <b>target</b> and <b>torque</b> <b>target</b> were in different quadrants). Analysis of the time course of directional errors revealed that the degree of adaptation was lower (by ~ 20 %) when reversals in the direction of joint torques were required. It has been established previously that in this task space, a transition between supination and pronation requires the engagement of a different set of muscle synergists, whereas in a transition between flexion and extension no such change is required. The additional observation that the initial level of adaptation was lower and the subsequent aftereffects were smaller, for trials that involved a pronation–supination transition than for those that involved a flexion–extension transition, supports the conclusion that the process of adaptation engaged, at least in part, neural circuits that represent the required motor output in a muscle-based coordinate system...|$|R
50|$|There {{also some}} {{alternative}} {{options in the}} way of interceptors like # Unichip that clamp the various inputs to the standard management systems, but they are restricted by the fact that fuel delivery generally cannot be easily increased as manipulation of the air-flow meter input and/or aggressive modifying of the ignition timing causes the Check Engine Light (CEL) to illuminate easily due to a deviation between the expected and <b>targeted</b> <b>torque</b> and quality of emissions.It is therefore common to increase the fuel pressure across the board by using an aftermarket fuel pressure regulator when tuning is performed by these interceptor computers, and trim the fuel out instead. However, increased fuel pressure has the side-effect of affecting the engine's ability to idle due to injector lockup, and as such sometimes an alternative solution of additional injectors instead of a raised-fuel-pressure regulator is proposed.The number of cars with such complex requirements is very low, and in general a full aftermarket engine management system is used in these cases, such as Nira or MoTeC.|$|R

However, most studies have been of short duration with limited functional application in those {{with spinal cord injury}} (SCI). We therefore tested force and fatigue in response to VFT, CFT, and combined patterns in strength training-like conditions (6 -s contractions). Methods : Ten SCI individuals underwent either CFT or VFT patterns until <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> was no longer produced and then switched immediately to the other pattern. Results : <b>Target</b> <b>torque</b> was reached more times when VFT was used first (VFT: 6. 70. 8 vs. CFT: 3. 5 +/- 0. 2 contractions, P< 0. 05) and when it was followed by the CFT pattern (VFT-CFT: 10. 3 +/- 1. 2 vs. CFT-VFT: 6. 9 +/- 1. 2 contractions, P< 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract: In {{conventional}} vehicles, {{the control}} of vehicle speed is achieved by changing the engine load through adjusting the acceleration pedal.

This method is an open-loop control, with which the engine brake cannot be implemented during downhill trips. In this paper, a closed-loop control of vehicle speed for electric vehicles is proposed. The target vehicle speed is set by the acceleration pedal. The controller collects the real vehicle speed, whereas the PID controller, according to the error of the real and target vehicle speed, adjusts the motor torque in real time to realize the closed-loop speed control. Under such controlling, the motor torque can be changed correspondingly with the resistance, thus makes the driving performance of electric vehicles more identical to that of conventional vehicles...|$|R

40|$|We {{quantify}} how the hip energetics {{and knee}} torque required for an above-knee prosthesis user {{to walk with}} the kinematics of able-bodied humans vary with the inertial properties of the prosthesis. We also select and optimize passive mechanical components for a prosthetic knee to accurately reproduce the required knee torque. Previous theoretical studies have typically investigated the effects of prosthesis inertial properties on energetic parameters by modifying both mass and mass distribution of the prosthesis and computing kinetic and energetic parameters only during swing. Using inverse dynamics, we determined the effects of independently modifying mass and mass distribution of the prosthesis, and we computed parameters during both stance and swing. Results showed that reducing prosthesis mass significantly affected hip energetics, whereas reducing mass distribution did not. Reducing prosthesis mass to 25 % {{of the mass of}} a physiological leg decreased peak stance hip power by 26 %, average swing hip power by 74 %, and absolute hip work over the gait cycle by 22 %. Previous studies have also typically optimized prosthetic knee components to reproduce the knee torque generated by able-bodied humans walking with normative kinematics. However, because the prosthetic leg of an above-knee prosthesis user weighs significantly less than a physiological leg, the knee torque required for above-knee prosthesis users to walk with these kinematics may be significantly different. Again using inverse dynamics, it was found that changes in prosthesis mass and mass distribution significantly affected this required torque. Reducing the mass of the prosthesis to 25 % of the mass of the physiological leg increased peak stance torque by 43 % and decreased peak swing torque by 76 %. The knee power required for an above-knee prosthesis user to walk with the kinematics of able-bodied humans was analyzed to select passive mechanical components for the prosthetic knee. The coefficients of the components were then optimized to replicate the torque required to walk with the kinematics of able-bodied humans. A prosthetic knee containing a single linear spring and two constant-force dampers was found to accurately replicate the <b>targeted</b> <b>torque</b> (R[superscript 2]= 0. 90 for a typical prosthesis). Optimal spring coefficients were found to be relatively insensitive to mass alterations of the prosthetic leg, but optimal damping coefficients were sensitive. In particular, as the masses of the segments of the prosthetic leg were altered between 25 % and 100 % of able-bodied values, the optimal damping coefficient of the second damper varied by 330 %, with foot mass alterations having the greatest effect on its value.

Normalized mean (NMAE) and peak (NPAE) of the absolute error were both used to quantify accuracy, whereas normalized standard deviation of the absolute error (NSAE) was used to quantify steadiness of the torque trials in the time domain. Mean and median power frequencies (MnPF, MdPF) and normalized peak power (NPkP) were used to assess the spectral structure of the torque signals. NMAE, NSAE and NPAE all showed excellent intra- as well as intersession reliabilities (intraclass correlation values greater than 0. 75 and low standard error of measurement values), demonstrating repeatability of the test set-up. NMAE, NSAE and NPAE increased significantly post-fatigue (greater than 42 %), together with a shift towards higher frequency (MnPF and MdPF) components, indicating that the set-up was sensitive enough to detect the decreased force accuracy and steadiness of the musculature after fatigue.

To that purpose, modulations of motor-evoked potential (MEP) and Hoffmann (H) reflex were compared in the soleus (SOL) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) during anisometric submaximal and maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of the plantar flexor muscles. For the submaximal shortening and lengthening contractions, the <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> was set at 50 % of their respective MVC force. The results indicate that the amplitudes of both MEP and H-reflex responses, normalized to the maximal M wave, were significantly (P 0. 05) was observed for MG. In addition, the silent period in the ongoing electromyogram (EMG) activity following the MEP was significantly (P 0. 05) between contraction intensities and muscles. Together, these results indicate that cortical and spinal mechanisms involved in the modulation of muscle activation during shortening and lengthening contractions differ between synergistic muscles according to the torque produced. Data further document previous studies reporting that the specific modulation of muscle activation during lengthening contraction is not torque dependent...|$|E
30|$|The {{limitation}} {{of the present study}} was the number of samples. We believed the sample number (seven in each group) was sufficient to obtain the trends of microleakage, but it may be better to investigate using large number of samples to analyze the nature of microleakage at the implant–abutment interface in detail. Another limitation was that the fastening torque applied to screw was not necessarily accurate. To mimic clinical situation, we used dedicated beam-type toque wrench delivered from manufacturer. According to the previous studies, the wrench of Nobel Biocare only reportedly demonstrated the <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> value falling within the 95 % confidence interval for the true population mean among four kinds of wrenches [17]. In addition, significantly lower deviations of torque values for beam-type wrenches were reported than for coil and toggle-style wrenches [18]. But toque wrench still has an inaccuracy because the scale printed on the wrench is not fine and it seems to be inappropriate to apply precise torque value. In the present study, we used new torque wrench, but in the clinical settings, variability of toque value may expand because torque wrench is repeatedly used, with sterilization procedure, which decrease the accuracy [19].|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{permanent}} magnet spherical motor control system, {{in order to}} obtain control current of the stator winding, it is required to solve the generalized inverse of the torque matrix of high dimension, which increases the computational burden of the control system. To solve this problem, the torque-sharing strategy of double-pole structure of PMSM was discussed. The <b>target</b> <b>torque</b> was decomposed into the rotation torque and the tilting torque through comparing the torque component of different stator windings. The set of control winding is divided. Further, according to the torque characteristics of a collection of internal stator winding and rotor position, an energizing strategy of the windings was developed, and the rotation and tilt torque control matrix were obtained, and two dimensional reduction matrixes reduced the computational burden. On this basis, the dynamics model and electrical model of PMSM were established, and the control system consisted of position loop and current loop. Control torque was obtained by the calculation of the torque method, and control current was obtained by torque-sharing strategy. Simulation results show that the system is able to achieve independent control of rotation and tilt and track the desired trajectory...|$|E
40|$|Industrial robots {{carry out}} simple tasks in {{customized}} environments {{for which it}} is typical that nearly all effector movements can be planned during an offline phase. A continual control based on sensory feedback is at most necessary at effector positions near <b>target</b> locations utilizing <b>torque</b> or haptic sensors. It is desirable to develop new-generation robots showing higher degrees of autonomy for solving high-level deliberate tasks in natural and dynamic environments. Obviously, camera-equipped robot systems, which take and process images and make use of the visual data, can solve more sophisticated robotic tasks. The development of a (semi-) autonomous camera-equipped robot must be grounded on an infrastructure, based on which the system can acquire and/or adapt task-relevant competences autonomously. This infrastructure consists of technical equipment to support the presentation of real world training samples, various learning mechanisms for automatically acquiring function approximations, and testing methods for evaluating the quality of the learned functions. Accordingly, for developing autonomou...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{present an}} optimal torque {{investigation}} of outer-rotor hybrid excitation flux switching machine (OR-HEFSM) for in-wheel drive electric vehicle (EV). Previously, {{most of the}} successful electric machines for electric drive in EV/HEV is interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) due {{to their ability to}} deliver high torque and power densities for great starting and climbing conditions. Nevertheless, the IPMSM has some demerit owing to high volume of permanent magnet (PM) used and unrobustness rotor. As an alternative candidates, flux switching machine (FSM) having robust rotor structure and higher torque capability has been proposed for EV/HEV drive and many research has been reported over the last decade. However, most of them are mainly focused on inner-rotor configuration. Therefore, in this paper the proposed OR-HEFSM is investigated to have maximum performances similar to IPMSM conventionally employed in existing HEV. Several defined parameters of OR-HEFSM are treated using determistic optmization method to attempt maximum torque performance. After several cycles of optimization investigation, the proposed machine has achieved the <b>target</b> maximum average <b>torque</b> and power of 335. 08 Nm and 160. 2 kW, respectively...|$|R
40|$|An {{instrument}} {{to measure the}} momentum flux (total pressure) of plasma and neutral particle jets onto a surface has been developed. While this instrument was developed for magnetized plasmas, the concept works for non-magnetized plasmas as well. We have measured forces as small as 10 (exp - 4) Newtons on a surface immersed in the plasma where small forces are due to ionic and neutral particles with kinetic energies {{on the order of}} a few eV impacting the surface. This instrument, a force sensor, uses a target plate (surface) that is immersed in the plasma and connected to one end of an alumina rod while {{the opposite end of the}} alumina rod is mechanically connected to a titanium beam on which four strain gauges are mounted. The force on the <b>target</b> generates <b>torque</b> causing strain in the beam. The resulting strain measurements can be correlated to a force on the target plate. The alumina rod electrically and thermally isolates the target plate from the strain gauge beam and allows the strain gauges to be located out of the plasma flow while also serving as a moment arm of several inches to increase the strain in the beam at the strain gauge location. These force measurements correspond directly to momentum flux and may be used with known plasma conditions to place boundaries on the kinetic energies of the plasma and neutral particles. The force measurements may also be used to infer thrust produced by a plasma propulsive device. Stainless steel, titanium, molybdenum, and aluminum flat target plates have been used. Momentum flux measurements of H 2, D 2, He, and Ar plasmas produced in a magnetized plasma device have been performed...|$|R
