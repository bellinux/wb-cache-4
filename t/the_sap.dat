5|$|A {{large number}} of {{technological}} changes {{took place during the}} 1970s. Plastic tubing systems that had been experimental since {{the early part of the}} century were perfected, and <b>the</b> <b>sap</b> came directly from the tree to the evaporator house. Vacuum pumps were added to the tubing systems, and preheaters were developed to recycle heat lost in the steam. Producers developed reverse-osmosis machines to take a portion of water out of <b>the</b> <b>sap</b> before it was boiled, increasing processing efficiency.|$|E
5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of sap {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, <b>the</b> <b>sap</b> of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of <b>the</b> <b>sap</b> is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. <b>The</b> <b>sap</b> is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a sugar content of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in <b>the</b> <b>sap</b> of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, <b>the</b> <b>sap</b> of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a sugar content of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.|$|E

40|$|Superabsorbent {{polymers}} (SAPs) of acrylic acid, sodium acrylate, and acrylamide (AM), crosslinked with {{ethylene glycol}} dimethacrylate, were synthesized by inverse suspension polymerization. The equilibrium swelling capacities of <b>the</b> <b>SAPs</b> were determined and these decreased with increasing AM content. The adsorption {{of the two}} cationic dyes, methylene blue and rhodamine 6 G, on the dry as well as equilibrium swollen <b>SAPs</b> was investigated. <b>The</b> amount of the dye adsorbed at equilibrium per unit weight of <b>the</b> <b>SAPs</b> and <b>the</b> rate constants of adsorption were determined. The amount of the dye adsorbed at equilibrium by <b>the</b> <b>SAPs</b> decreased with increasing mol % of AM in <b>the</b> <b>SAPs.</b> <b>The</b> amount of the dye adsorbed at equilibrium was almost equal for the dry and equilibrium swollen <b>SAPs.</b> However, <b>the</b> equilibrium swollen <b>SAPs</b> adsorbed dyes {{at a higher rate}} than <b>the</b> dry <b>SAPs.</b> <b>The</b> higher rate of adsorption was attributed to the availability of all the anionic groups present in the fully elongated conformation of <b>the</b> <b>SAPs</b> in <b>the</b> equilibrium swollen state.

5|$|Red maple is {{also used}} for the {{production}} of maple syrup, though the hard maples Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Acer nigrum (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared <b>the</b> <b>sap</b> and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, {{as well as those of}} the Acer saccharinum (silver maple), Acer negundo (boxelder), and Acer platanoides (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of <b>the</b> <b>sap</b> changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.|$|E

5|$|Maple syrup is a syrup {{usually made}} from the xylem sap of sugar maple, red maple, or black maple trees, {{although}} {{it can also be}} made from other maple species. In cold climates, these trees store starch in their trunks and roots before the winter; the starch is then converted to sugar that rises in <b>the</b> <b>sap</b> in late winter and early spring. Maple trees are tapped by drilling holes into their trunks and collecting the exuded sap, which is processed by heating to evaporate much of the water, leaving the concentrated syrup.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{metabolomic}} approach, we have quantified the metabolite {{composition of}} <b>the</b> phloem <b>sap</b> exudate of seventeen European and American lines of maize {{that had been}} previously classified into five main groups {{on the basis of}} molecular marker polymorphisms. In addition to sucrose, glutamate and aspartate, which are abundant in <b>the</b> phloem <b>sap</b> of many plant species, large quantities of aconitate and alanine were also found in <b>the</b> phloem <b>sap</b> exudates of maize. Genetic variability of <b>the</b> phloem <b>sap</b> composition was observed in the different maize lines, although there was no obvious relationship between <b>the</b> phloem <b>sap</b> composition and <b>the</b> five previously classified groups.

40|$|Summary In a field study, the {{composition}} and concentra-tions of amino compounds in <b>the</b> xylem <b>sap</b> of <b>the</b> mistletoe, Viscum album L., and in <b>the</b> xylem <b>sap</b> of two host species, an evergreen conifer (Abies alba Mill.) and a deciduous broad-leaved tree (Populus × euramericana), were analyzed. <b>The</b> xy-lem <b>sap</b> of both hosts and mistletoe contained large, but similar amounts of total organic nitrogen in low molecular weight amino compounds (TONLW). Nevertheless, individual amino compounds accumulated in <b>the</b> xylem <b>sap</b> of mistletoe relative to <b>the</b> host xylem <b>sap,</b> indicating selective uptake. In <b>the</b> xylem <b>sap</b> of Populus, major amino compounds (asparagine (Asn) and glutamine (Gln)) and the bulk parameters, TONLW and proteinogenic amino acids, showed significant seasonal varia-tion. In Abies and in mistletoe on either host, variation of amino compounds in xylem sap was largely explained by inter-annual differences, not by seasonal variation. In both hosts, TONLW in <b>the</b> xylem <b>sap</b> was dominated by Gln. There was a steady de-crease in relative abundance of Gln from <b>the</b> host xylem <b>sap</b> to <b>the</b> mistletoe xylem <b>sap</b> and to <b>the</b> stems and leaves of mistle-toe. Simultaneously, the abundance of arginine (Arg) in-creased. Arginine was the predominant amino compound in the stems and leaves of mistletoe, occurring at concentrations pre-viously observed only in leaves of trees exposed to excess ni-trogen. We conclude that Gln (2 mol N mol– 1) delivered by <b>the</b> host xylem <b>sap</b> is converted, in mistletoe, to Arg (4 mol N mol– 1) and that the organic carbon liberated from Gln contrib-utes significantly to the parasite’s heterotrophic carbon gain. Statistical analyses of the data support this conclusion. Accum-ulation of Arg in mistletoe {{is an indication of}} excess N supply {{as a result of the}} uptake of amino compounds from <b>the</b> host xy-lem <b>sap</b> and a lack of phloem uploading...|$|R

5|$|Oral {{tradition}} holds that, {{because of}} the great value of wood, only expert scribes used it, while pupils wrote on banana leaves. German ethnologist Thomas Barthel believed that carving on wood was a secondary development {{in the evolution of}} the script based on an earlier stage of incising banana leaves or the sheaths of the banana trunk with a bone stylus, and that the medium of leaves was retained not only for lessons but to plan and compose the texts of the wooden tablets.

5|$|Rolling / Shaping:The damp {{tea leaves}} are then rolled to be formed into {{wrinkled}} strips, by hand or using a rolling machine which causes the tea to wrap around itself. This rolling action also causes some of <b>the</b> <b>sap,</b> essential oils, and juices inside the leaves to ooze out, which further enhances {{the taste of}} the tea. The strips of tea can then be formed into other shapes, such as being rolled into spirals, kneaded and rolled into pellets, or tied into balls, cones and other elaborate shapes. In many types of oolong, the rolled strips of tea leaf are then rolled to spheres or half spheres and is typically done by placing the damp leaves in large cloth bags, which are then kneaded by hand or machine in a specific manner. The tea can also be pressed into bricks through the use of heavy stones or presses.|$|E

The maple sap was concentrated either by dropping hot cooking stones into the buckets or by leaving them exposed to the cold temperatures overnight and disposing of the layer of ice that formed on top. While there was widespread agriculture in Mesoamerica and the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States, the production of maple syrup is one of only a few agricultural processes in the Northeast that is not a European colonial import.|$|E
