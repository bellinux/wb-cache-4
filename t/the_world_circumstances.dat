Verse, if it has any enthusiasm, at once demands and conciliates attention; it proposes to say much in little; and it associates with it the idea of something consolatory, or otherwise sustaining. But there is one prose specimen of these details, which I will give, because it made so great an impression on me in my youth, that I never afterwards could help calling it to mind when war was spoken of; and as I had a good deal to say on that subject, having been a public journalist {{during one of the}} most interesting periods of modern history, and never having been blinded into an admiration of war by the dazzle of victory, the circumstance may help to show how salutary a record of this kind may be, and what an impression the subject might be brought to make on society. The passage is in a note to one of Mr Southey's poems, the [...] "Ode to Horror," [...] and is introduced by another frightful record, less horrible, because there is not such agony implied in it, nor is it alive.|$|E
40|$|Welcome to Berkeley Lab. You {{are joining}} or are already {{a part of}} a {{laboratory}} with a sterling tradition of scientific achievement, including eleven Nobel Laureates and thirteen National Medal of Science winners. No matter what job you do, you make Berkeley Lab the outstanding organization that it is. Without your hard work and dedication, we could not achieve all that we have. We value you and thank you for choosing to be part of our community. This Employee Handbook is designed to help you navigate the Lab. With over 3, 000 employees, an additional 3, 000 guests visiting from countries around the world, a 200 -acre campus and many policies and procedures, learning all the ins and outs may seem overwhelming, especially if you're a new employee. However, even if you have been here for a while, this Handbook should be a useful reference tool. It is meant to serve as a guide, highlighting and summarizing {{what you need to know}} and informing you where you can go for more detailed information. The general information provided in this Handbook serves only as a brief description of many of the Lab's policies. Policies, procedures and information are found in the Lab's Regulations and Procedures Manual (RPM), Summary Plan Descriptions, University of California policies, and provisions of Contract 31 between the Regents of the University and the U. S. Department of Energy. In addition, specific terms and conditions for represented employees are found in applicable collective bargaining agreements. Nothing in this Handbook is intended to supplant, change or conflict with the previously mentioned documents. In addition, the information in this Handbook does not constitute a contract or a promise of continued employment and may be changed at any time by the Lab. We believe employees are happier and more productive if they know what they can expect from their organization and what their organization expects from them. The Handbook will familiarize you with the privileges, benefits, and responsibilities of being an employee at Berkeley Lab. In this organization, as in the rest of <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>circumstances</b> are constantly changing. Policies and procedures can change at any time, so it is advisable to keep apprised of these changes by checking in frequently to the electronic version of this Employee Handbook found at www. lbl. gov/Workplace/HumanResources/EmployeeHandbook...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether or not freshmen living in the residence halls were encouraged to develop faith, as defined by James W. Fowler's faith development theory, based on Fall 2000 - Spring 2001 residence hall programming, activities and staff training. James W. Fowler defines faith as a person's way of giving meaning to the "forces and relations that make up our lives. " Although Fowler does not rule out faith as being made up of a religion, he does explain that under his definition faith is not always religious in content or context. In his published works, Fowler most often explains faith as a way of "knowing," (self, <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>circumstances,</b> etc.) and always refers to it as a verb. This is the definition of faith that was used throughout this study. While the intent was to evaluate whether or not freshmen were encouraged to develop faith, those people who were sources of this information were Ball State University Residence Hall Directors. There were 12 Residence Hall Directors during the Spring semester of 2001 that had freshmen living in their residence halls. Semi-structured, one-on-one interviews were conducted and audio recorded with each of these Residence Hall Directors. Participating directors were presented with an outline of Fowler's faith development theory prior to the interviews. During the interview, they responded to ten questions. All 12 directors interviewed indicated that the majority of freshmen come to college with an established religion that is primarily based on the faith and beliefs of their parents or guardians. The majority of the directors also observed the freshmen rarely want to be challenged in what they believe and have a difficult time reflecting on why they hold to particular values or beliefs. As the year progresses this does occasionally change. Students' values are most often influenced by peers: friends, roommates, and classmates who have new ideas and perspectives. Directors mentioned that values commonly challenged during the freshmen year are ones related to drinking, drugs, pre-marital sex, homosexuality, and race. Freshmen struggling with faith or religion are not likely to find answers within their residence halls. While all directors indicated that freshmen are searching for meaning in a variety of ways, there are few programs or activities within the residence halls that allow dialogue or reflection about values and beliefs. The only training that any residence hall staff received was an optional training session about different religions represented on campus. The findings of the study indicate that during the 2000 - 2001 academic year, the residence halls did not support or encourage the faith development of freshmen through residence hall activities, programming or the training of residence hall staff.

In lucid ingenious talk and logic, in all manner of brilliant utterance and tongue-fence, I have hardly known his fellow. So ready lay his store of knowledge round him, so perfect was his ready utterance of the same,--in coruscating wit, in jocund drollery, in compact articulated clearness or high poignant emphasis, as the case required,--he was a match for any man in argument before a crowd of men. One of the most supple-wristed, dexterous, graceful and successful fencers in that kind.
