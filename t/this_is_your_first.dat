As reported on the obi strip on volume 4 of the Shakugan no Shana manga released in January 2008, 1.2 million copies of the manga had been sold. Theron Martin from Anime News Network reviewed the manga and called it [...] "inferior" [...] to the anime, and notes the anime develops characters better than the manga. Martin also critiques the art, saying the background art has little detail, and while the action scenes are handled well enough, they are still sub-par compared to the same scenes in the anime.

500|$|Craig began poorly; in ten innings {{before the}} Tests started, he scored only 146 runs at 14.60 without passing fifty. He was {{overlooked}} for the First Test, {{and continued to}} struggle for runs during the tour; he ended with 429runs in 27innings with a top score of 71 not out and an average of 16.50. He was not selected for any Tests. Craig had difficulty adjusting to the English pitch conditions and his confidence plummeted. Craig had particular trouble against off cutters on the seaming pitches. In a reception at Lord's, the home of cricket, Queen Elizabeth II asked him [...] "I understand <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> visit to England?", which prompted Craig to reply [...] "Yes, your majesty, and unless my batting improves, it will be my last." [...] During the tour, tensions sometimes arose between the senior players, who were war veterans and drinkers, while the younger players including Craig tended to abstain from alcohol. Craig estimated that bus journeys to matches proceeded at an average speed of 16km/h because of persistent stoppages outside pubs, something that frustrated the non-drinkers.|$|E
2500|$|The new Pro mode was {{critically}} acclaimed {{as the primary}} feature that distinguished Rock Band 3 from other music games in the field. Minkley stated that the inclusions of Pro features [...] "at once dramatically expand {{the potential of the}} game and fundamentally change the approach required to play and enjoy it". Reviewers appreciated the training modes, including their integration into the overall game's career progression and the breadth of material that is covered. Nina Shen Rastogi of Slate commented that Rock Band 3s training modes [...] helps to overcome the discouraging early period of trying to learn guitar as [...] "the gaming elements will mask the rote, homeworklike nature of the guitar training process". Kuchera noted that the modes were aimed at those who have some understanding of music theory already; [...] "If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> introduction to music theory, though, you may need a little more explanation", he concluded. This lament was similarly stated by Machkovech, who felt the lessons had [...] "text that was written by a musical savant" [...] that would be too confusing to those without musical backgrounds and too simple for those trained in music arts. [...] Chris Kohler of Wired described the experience he and a friend had where after playing though Devo's [...] "Whip It" [...] on Pro guitar and keyboard, they were able retain enough muscle memory to play their respective parts on real instruments, albeit not perfectly; Kohler summarized his experience that [...] "Just playing Rock Band 3 taught us a little bit of actual music".|$|E

40|$|Among {{the recent}} {{avalanche}} {{of books on}} carnivorous plants <b>is</b> <b>this</b> book that <b>is</b> completely dedi-cated to just one plant, the Venus’s Flytrap. The authors, Tim Bailey and Stewart McPherson, are two well-known carnivorous plant enthusiasts. <b>This</b> review <b>is</b> my impression of the book, while comparing it to Tim Bailey’s previous work on this species: Miraculum Naturae: Venus’s Flytrap (Bailey 2008). This new book displays the well known Redfern quality in being glossy, full of high quality color photographs and above all, thick/heavy. The content is largely comparable to Bailey’s Miracu-lum Naturae, something the current authors readily acknowledge. It was their intent to produce an improved version of Bailey’s book and to add new material as well. In this they undoubtedly suc-ceeded. Bailey’s original book was a private publication on a tight budget and the difference with this new book shows. A hard cover, beautiful full color photographs on high quality paper, and a much clearer print are {{the first things that}} are noticeable in a comparison.

60|$|The ideal {{holiday in}} bed {{does not require}} the {{presence}} of a ministering angel in the room all day. You frequently prefer to be alone, and point out to your wife that you cannot have her trifling with her health for your sake, and so she must go out for a walk. She is reluctant, but finally goes, protesting that you are the most unselfish of men, and only too good for her. This leaves a pleasant aroma behind it, for even when lying in bed, we like to feel that we are uncommonly fine fellows. After she has gone you get up cautiously, and, walking stealthily to the wardrobe, produce from the pocket of your great coat a good novel. A holiday in bed must be arranged for beforehand. With a gleam in your eye you slip back to bed, double your pillow to make it higher, and begin to read. You have only got to the fourth page, when you make a horrible discovery--namely, that the book is not cut. An experienced holiday-maker would have had it cut the night before, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> real holiday, or perhaps you have been thoughtless. In any case you have now matter to think of. You are torn in two different ways. There is your coat on the floor with a knife in it, but you cannot reach the coat without getting up again. Ought you to get the knife or to give up reading? Perhaps it takes {{a quarter of an hour}} to decide this question, and you decide it by discovering a third course. Being a sort of an invalid, you have certain privileges which would be denied you if you were merely sitting in a chair in the agonies of neuralgia. One of the glorious privileges of a holiday in bed is that you are entitled to cut books with your fingers. So you cut the novel in this way, and read on.|$|E

He was a shade too sentimental for my own sympathies, and I fancied he was rather too fond of superfine discriminations and of discovering subtle intentions in shallow places. At moments, too, he plunged into the sea of metaphysics, and floundered a while in waters too deep for intellectual security. But his abounding knowledge and happy judgment told a touching story of long attentive hours in this worshipful company; there was a reproach to my wasteful saunterings in so devoted a culture of opportunity. [...] "There are two moods," [...] I remember his saying, [...] "in which we may walk through galleries--the critical and the ideal. They seize us at their pleasure, and we can never tell which is to take its turn. The critical mood, oddly, is the genial one, the friendly, the condescending. It relishes the pretty trivialities of art, its vulgar cleverness, its conscious graces. It has a kindly greeting for anything which looks as if, according to his light, the painter had enjoyed doing it--for the little Dutch cabbages and kettles, for the taper fingers and breezy mantles of late-coming Madonnas, for the little blue-hilled, pastoral, sceptical Italian landscapes. Then there are the days of fierce, fastidious longing--solemn church feasts of the intellect--when all vulgar effort and all petty success is a weariness, and everything but the best--the best of the best--disgusts. In these hours we are relentless aristocrats of taste. We will not take Michael Angelo for granted, we will not swallow Raphael whole!" ...|$|E
