5|$|Eventually, Hurcomb {{put forward}} at a ministerial meeting a {{solution}} whereby {{the members of}} the inquiry would inform NESCo that on purely technical grounds they would have approved <b>the</b> <b>scheme,</b> but due to the opposition of Morrison, they had decided not to proceed to a decision.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, for I-frames, the bitstream of <b>the</b> HL <b>scheme</b> only contains high bit-depth information. Intuitively, {{this will}} result in bandwidth inefficiency if the receiver uses a low bit-depth display device, {{especially in the case}} where a small GOP size is adopted and the data in the I-frames dominate the bitstream. To improve the coding efficiency in such situations, we combine <b>the</b> HL <b>scheme</b> with <b>the</b> LH <b>scheme</b> to form a hybrid LH-HL <b>scheme</b> in which <b>the</b> intra-MBs and inter-MBs are encoded by <b>the</b> LH <b>scheme</b> and <b>the</b> HL <b>scheme,</b> respectively. It means that intra-mode-encoding path in <b>the</b> LH <b>scheme</b> and inter-mode-encoding path in <b>the</b> HL <b>scheme</b> are combined in <b>the</b> LH-HL <b>scheme.</b> For every high bit-depth MB in <b>the</b> LH-HL <b>scheme,</b> either intra-mode or inter-mode is chosen by comparing the R-D cost. It means that the R-D cost of intra-coding by <b>the</b> LH <b>scheme</b> and <b>the</b> R-D cost of inter-coding by <b>the</b> HL <b>scheme</b> will be compared. If the R-D cost of intra-coding by <b>the</b> LH <b>scheme</b> is smaller, then this MB is encoded as intra-mode; otherwise, it is inter-mode and encoded by <b>the</b> HL <b>scheme.</b> <b>The</b> combined LH-HL <b>scheme</b> tries to improve the coding performance of <b>the</b> HL <b>scheme</b> in <b>the</b> above situation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} dedicated path-protection in wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) mesh networks with waveband switching functionality under shared risk link group (SRLG) constraints. Two dedicated pathprotection schemes are proposed, namely <b>the</b> PBABL <b>scheme</b> and <b>the</b> MPABWL <b>scheme.</b> <b>The</b> PBABL <b>scheme</b> protects each working waveband-path through a backup waveband-path. <b>The</b> MPABWL <b>scheme</b> protects each working waveband-path by either a backup waveband-path or multiple backup lightpaths. Heuristic algorithms adopting random optimization technique are proposed for both <b>the</b> <b>schemes.</b> <b>The</b> performance of <b>the</b> two protection <b>schemes</b> is studied and compared.

5|$|In November 1991, the Ministry of the Interior {{redefined the}} {{organisation}} {{of the special}} police force, retaining a few units under direct control of the ministry and assigning others to county police administrations. The move was devised {{in response to the}} advance of the JNA. <b>The</b> <b>scheme</b> included the establishment of an SPU in each of the 20 county police administrations. At the time, there were up to 19 such SPUs. Under <b>the</b> <b>scheme,</b> the Karlovac, Gospić, Osijek, Slavonski Brod and Zagreb SPUs were planned to have 180 troops each. The Rijeka, Sisak, Bjelovar and Šibenik SPUs were scheduled to comprise 150 troops each, while the Split, Zadar, Kutina, Vinkovci, Županja and Vukovar SPUs were planned as 120-strong units. The smallest, 100-strong units were to be based in Pula, Varaždin, Zabok and Dubrovnik. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> called for 2,620 active special police troops in the regionally organised units alone, and defined that each of the units should have a matching number of reserve troops.|$|E

5|$|Since its inception, <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> {{has been}} widely criticised.

Furthermore, members of the opposition have criticized <b>the</b> <b>scheme</b> for creating an unequal playing field in a general election by enabling the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) to argue that the electorate need not vote for opposition candidates as there will already be some opposition representation in Parliament. Despite this critique, several opposition politicians have accepted NCMP seats, including Lee Siew-Choh, J. B. Jeyaretnam, Steve Chia and Sylvia Lim. NCMPs have raised notable points in Parliament with regards to various public policy issues such as criminal procedure, education, health and social welfare.|$|E
30|$|As {{described}} previously, {{to alleviate}} the peak regeneration phenomenon, <b>the</b> CAF <b>scheme</b> should set up a clipping threshold that {{is lower than the}} target PAPR level. Thus, <b>the</b> CAF <b>scheme</b> generates excessive degradation of the EVM performance. However, <b>the</b> CAF <b>scheme</b> eliminates peak signals with a fixed signal loss regardless of whether successive peak signals occur. In addition, <b>the</b> PW <b>scheme</b> eliminates peak signals smoothly by multiplying them by a specific window function. However, when the consecutive peak signals occur within half of the window length in <b>the</b> PW <b>scheme,</b> <b>the</b> window function can overlap. This leads to unintended distortions of the original signals and generates unintended distortion signals, even if the signal is under the clipping threshold. However, <b>the</b> PW <b>scheme</b> is usually preferred to <b>the</b> PAPR reduction <b>scheme</b> because it results in reduced performance degradation compared to <b>the</b> CAF <b>scheme.</b> In summary, using the same clipping threshold as <b>the</b> PW <b>scheme,</b> <b>the</b> CAF <b>scheme</b> cannot eliminate high-PAPR signals entirely because of the peak regeneration phenomenon. Furthermore, <b>the</b> PW <b>scheme</b> can deteriorate signal distortion in the case of successive peak signals.|$|R
30|$|It is {{observed}} that <b>the</b> LLNC <b>scheme</b> outperforms <b>the</b> other three <b>schemes.</b> This superiority is small {{when compared to}} <b>the</b> ADNF <b>scheme</b> but is noticeable when compared to <b>the</b> AF <b>scheme.</b> <b>The</b> inferiority {{is due to the}} effect of MA interference, where users send their signal at the same time during the MA stage. This effect is the highest for <b>the</b> AF <b>scheme,</b> where <b>the</b> amplification of noise degrades the performance. For <b>the</b> ADNF <b>scheme,</b> at high SNRs, the CEP can be removed by removing the singular points, which results in a better performance than <b>the</b> NADNF <b>scheme.</b> Note that <b>the</b> two singular points 0 and ∞ are inevitable. This explains the effect of fading on <b>the</b> MA <b>schemes.</b> For <b>the</b> AWGN channel, however, PLNC outperforms <b>the</b> LLNC <b>scheme</b> [8].

30|$|Currently, several {{cooperative}} transmission protocols {{have been}} proposed and can be categorized into two principal classes: <b>the</b> amplify-and-forward (AF) <b>scheme</b> and <b>the</b> decode-and-forward (DF) <b>scheme.</b> In <b>the</b> AF <b>scheme,</b> <b>the</b> relay terminals amplify the signals from the source terminal and forward them to the destination terminal. In <b>the</b> DF <b>scheme,</b> <b>the</b> relay terminals first decode their received signals and then forward them to the destination terminal. Compared with <b>the</b> DF <b>scheme,</b> <b>the</b> AF <b>scheme</b> is more attractive for its low complexity since the cooperative terminals {{do not need to}} decode their received signals.
