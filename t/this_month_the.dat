5|$|Most 14th-century Hungarian chroniclers {{write that}} Charles and Elisabeth of Poland had five sons. Their first son, Charles, {{was born in}} 1321 and died {{in the same year}} {{according}} to the Illuminated Chronicle. However, a charter of June 1323 states that the child had died in <b>this</b> <b>month.</b> <b>The</b> second son of Charles and Elisabeth, Ladislaus, was born in 1324. The marriage of Ladislaus and Anne, a daughter of King John of Bohemia, was planned by their parents, but Ladislaus died in 1329. Charles's and Elisabeth's third son, Louis, who was born in 1326, survived his father and succeeded him as King of Hungary. His younger brothers, Andrew and Stephen, who were born in 1327 and 1332, respectively, also survived Charles.|$|E

25|$|Extra Month, or Adhika Māsa falls every 32.5 {{months on}} an average. It {{is also known}} as Puruśottama Māsa, it is said that the name was given by Lord Vishnu as his name to <b>this</b> <b>month.</b> <b>The</b> solar year is made up of 365 days and about 6 hours, and the lunar year is made up of 354 days. Thus there is a gap of 11 days, 1 hour, 31 minutes and 12 seconds between the lunar and the solar years. As this gap accumulates each year, it approximates in three years to one month. No adhik mas falls during Margsheersh to Magh. A case of Adhik Karttik is {{extremely}} rare, but in the 250-year span (1901-2150 AD) it would occur once, in 1963 AD.|$|E

Under his leadership, Air Group 18 racked up 187 enemies destroyed airborne, 69 ships sunk and a number of others damaged, including a carrier, a light carrier and five battleships.

Production of these prototypes began on 20 May 1934 and, on 23 November 1934, the Do 17 V1, with a single fin and powered by two BMW VI 7.3 motors, took off on its first flight. Testing was delayed {{by a series of}} accidents, with V1 being damaged in landing accidents in February and April 1935. The twin-tailed V2 (powered by low-compression BMW VI 6.3 engines) first flew on 18 May 1935 and was evaluated together with the V1 by the Ministry of Aviation at Rechlin in June. During the tests, the single fin proved to be only marginally stable, resulting in the V1 being modified with a twin tail. The aircraft was destroyed in a crash after an engine failure on 21 December 1935. The V3, also fitted with a twin tail, was originally planned to be powered by Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs engines, but as these were unavailable, it was fitted with BMW VI 7.3 engines like the V1 and flew on 19 September 1935. The V1 prototype remained the only built machine with the single stabilizer.|$|E
2500|$|Similar to Philippine culture, CCBC usually conducts several parties {{one after}} the other during the month of December to {{celebrate}} the Christmas season.

Members walk to the stage to drop their offerings as the month of their birthdates are called out, while the band repeatedly plays the song, “Happy Birthday to You", which is later modified to [...] "Happy Birthday, Jesus."

2500|$|The Colonist {{left the}} Tuscars, being the last land {{seen on the}} British coast, on the 18th of December last, and. under all the circumstances, may be {{considered}} {{to have made a}} most successful voyage out. She is but a small schooner, of only 105 tons, but she withstood wonderfully the various winds and weather which she encountered in the different latitudes, and proved herself a capital little vessel in sailing qualities and otherwise. In the tropics she was becalmed for about a fortnight, and when off Kerguelen Island met with a very violent gale, during the prevalence of which she shipped a heavy sea, but was in no way disabled, and she made out Stewart's Island on the 13th of <b>this</b> <b>month.</b> <b>The</b> Colonist was only launched shortly before departure, her builders being Messrs.

2500|$|Writing for The Boston Globe on 14 October 2007, Scott Allen {{reported}} {{the issue of}} patient abuse and problems with human resources management at Mount Sinai by Dr. Jack M. Gorman who was Department Chairman of Psychiatry at Mount Sinai. Allen stated that; [...] "... officials at McLean learned that Gorman had, like so many patients at the renowned psychiatric hospital, attempted suicide. But their initial sympathy for a sick man turned to horror when they learned, from a legal document delivered in mid-May, why he had taken such a desperate measure. The married father of two had brought a shameful secret with him to Massachusetts: He had engaged in a long-term sexual relationship with a New York patient... Gorman, 55, inspired great hope when McLean and Partners announced that they had lured him away from New York City's Mount Sinai School of Medicine in October 2005... It was Gorman's decision to contact the New York Board of Professional Medical Conduct that finally brought the episode to public attention. Earlier <b>this</b> <b>month,</b> <b>the</b> board finally acted on what Gorman told them, posting on its website that his medical license had been indefinitely suspended for 'inappropriate sexual contact' with a patient." ...|$|E

During <b>this</b> <b>month,</b> <b>the</b> gates of hell are opened up and ghosts are free to roam the earth where they seek food and entertainment. These ghosts are believed to be ancestors of those who forgot to pay tribute to them after they died, or those who were never given a proper ritual send-off. They have long needle-thin necks because they have not been fed by their family, or as a punishment so that they are unable to swallow. Family members offer prayers to their deceased relatives, offer food and drink and burn hell bank notes and other forms of joss paper. Joss paper items are believed to have value in the afterlife, considered to be very similar in some aspects to the material world, People burn paper houses, cars, servants and televisions to please the ghosts. Families also pay tribute to other unknown wandering ghosts so that these homeless souls do not intrude on their lives and bring misfortune. A large feast is held for the ghosts on the fourteenth day of the seventh month, when people bring samples of food and place them on an offering table to please the ghosts and ward off bad luck. [...] Lotus-shaped lanterns are lit and set afloat in rivers and out onto seas to symbolicly guide the lost souls of forgotten ancestors to the afterlife.|$|E
