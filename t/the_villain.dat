5000|$|The most {{important}} feature of these mecha is a deadly device which <b>the</b> <b>villains</b> wish to finish the heroes off for good, and has been dubbed as [...] "Highlight of the Week" [...] ("今週のハイライト") by <b>the</b> <b>villains</b> (It is usually {{in the shape of}} a bomb launched in various crazy fashions). However, the triggering of such device often backfires onto <b>the</b> <b>villains</b> themselves either by silly mistakes in mechanical design or the foiling of the heroes, causing the whole structure to explode spectacularly, only leaving the Time Skull fully intact and <b>the</b> <b>villains</b> very tattered (Grocky, unfornately, is victimized every time by his female boss for the failure).|$|R

5|$|The {{climax of}} most Bond films {{is the final}} {{confrontation}} with <b>the</b> <b>villain</b> and his henchmen, sometimes an entire army of cohorts, often in his hard-to-reach lair.

Bond usually sabotages the lair and, with time ticking down, dispatches the supervillain, rescues the principal Bond girl and they escape as the place blows up. In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>villain</b> or his primary henchman escapes to launch a final attack on Bond and his lover in the final scene.|$|E

5000|$|Shallow {{returned}} to play Survivor {{for a third}} time as a part of <b>the</b> <b>Villains</b> tribe. She quickly accepted an alliance with Russell Hantz and Danielle DiLorenzo. On Day 18, <b>the</b> <b>Villains</b> lost immunity, and the alliance of Shallow, Hantz, and DiLorenzo were still struggling to gain control of the game. They finally gained control when they persuaded Jerri Manthey to switch sides and vote out Hantz's rival, [...] "Boston Rob" [...] Mariano. Because <b>the</b> <b>Villains</b> had yet to vote out a female member at that point in the game, the Heroes assumed that <b>the</b> <b>Villains</b> tribe was being run by an all-women alliance, led by Shallow. When <b>the</b> <b>Villains</b> lost immunity again on Day 21, they decided to further confirm the Heroes' belief of that, by voting out Benjamin [...] "Coach" [...] Wade. Shallow and DiLorenzo both found the hidden immunity idol together and decided not to tell Hantz. On Day 24, <b>the</b> <b>Villains</b> lost immunity again and James [...] "J. T." [...] Thomas, Jr. gave his idol to Hantz, in hopes that he would use it to vote out Shallow. Hantz, however, showed it to Shallow, along with DiLorenzo and Manthey.|$|R

5|$|As {{the first}} film in the series, {{a number of the}} {{elements}} of Dr. No were contributors to subsequent films, including Monty Norman's Bond theme and Maurice Binder's gun barrel sequence, variants of which all appeared in subsequent films. These conventions were also lampooned in spoof films, such as the Austin Powers series. The first spoof films happened relatively soon after Dr. No, with the 1964 film Carry On Spying showing <b>the</b> <b>villain</b> Dr. Crow being overcome by agents who included Charlie Bind (Charles Hawtrey) and Daphne Honeybutt (Barbara Windsor).|$|E
