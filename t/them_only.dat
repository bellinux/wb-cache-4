5|$|The Germans finally flanked the American {{forces at}} dusk, {{capturing}} <b>them.</b> <b>Only</b> one American, a forward artillery observer, was killed, while 14 were wounded: German casualties totaled 92.

Only when SS-Standartenführer Joachim Peiper and his Panzer tanks arrived at midnight, twelve hours behind schedule, did the Germans learn the nearby woods were empty.|$|E
5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of three to five light-blue eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are naked and have their eyes closed {{for the first few}} days after hatching. While the chicks are still young, the mother broods them continuously. When they are older, the mother will brood <b>them</b> <b>only</b> at night or during bad weather.|$|E

5|$|Because Ireland became {{isolated}} from mainland Europe by rising sea levels {{before the last}} ice age had completely finished, it has fewer land animal and plant species than Great Britain, which separated later, or mainland Europe. There are 55 mammal species in Ireland and of <b>them</b> <b>only</b> 26 land mammal species are considered native to Ireland. Some species, such as, the red fox, hedgehog and badger, are very common, whereas others, like the Irish hare, red deer and pine marten are less so. Aquatic wildlife, such as species of sea turtle, shark, seal, whale, and dolphin, are common off the coast. About 400 species of birds have been recorded in Ireland. Many of these are migratory, including the barn swallow.|$|E
5|$|Each {{city and}} county in the Metro service area has similar {{ordinances}} that regulate or prohibit vending on Metro-owned property, and which prohibit riders from eating, drinking, or smoking in Metro trains, buses, and stations; the Transit Police {{have a reputation for}} enforcing these laws rigorously. One widely publicized incident occurred in October 2000 when police arrested 12-year-old Ansche Hedgepeth for eating french fries in the Tenleytown-AU station. In a 2004 opinion by John Roberts, now Chief Justice of the United States, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Hedgepeth's arrest. By then WMATA had answered negative publicity by adopting a policy of first issuing warnings to juveniles, and arresting <b>them</b> <b>only</b> after three violations within a year.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are among}} the least studied of all lemurs, and {{little is known about}} <b>them.</b> <b>Only</b> the pale fork-marked lemur (P.pallescens) has been studied {{relatively}} well, primarily by Pierre Charles-Dominique, Jean-Jacques Petter, and Georges Pariente during two expeditions in the 1970s and a more extensive 1998 study in Kirindy Forest. Like the other cheirogaleids, these lemurs are nocturnal, sleeping in tree hollows (typically in large baobab trees) or abandoned nests built by giant mouse lemurs (Mirza coquereli) during the day. Some of the abandoned nests they sleep in are leaf-lined, and fresh leaves are often added when young are born. As many as 30sleeping sites may be used {{over the course of a}} year, each for a variable length of time.|$|E

5|$|In {{the game}} with Auburn, Tech piled up 472 yards {{on the ground in}} 84 rushes and 145 yards in the air. Guyon scored four {{touchdown}}s, and Strupper had a 65-yard touchdown run. According to the Atlanta Journal,It was not the length of the run that featured it was the brilliance of it. After getting through the first line, Stroop was tackled squarely by two secondary men, and yet he squirmed and jerked loosed from <b>them,</b> <b>only</b> to face the safety man and another Tiger, coming at him from different angles. Without checking his speed Everett knifed the two men completely, running between them and dashing on to a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Natural thorium {{is usually}} almost pure 232Th, {{which is the}} longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium, having a {{half-life}} comparable {{to the age of}} the universe. Its radioactive decay is the largest single contributor to the Earth's internal heat; the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial radionuclides, which are 238U, 40K, and 235U in descending order of their contribution. (At the time of the Earth's formation, 40K and 235U contributed much more by virtue of their short half-lives, but they have decayed more quickly, leaving the contribution from 232Th and 238U predominant.) The other natural thorium isotopes are much shorter-lived; of <b>them,</b> <b>only</b> 230Th is usually detectable, occurring in secular equilibrium with its parent 238U, and making up at most 0.04% of natural thorium.|$|E

Most of them had been sold by that time and another 50 were with Silvert in New York. Only three were at Orgonon. The FDA agents were not allowed to destroy <b>them,</b> <b>only</b> to supervise the destruction, so Reich's friends and his son, Peter, chopped them up with axes as the agents watched. Once they were destroyed, Reich placed an American flag on top of them.|$|E

5|$|Shane arms {{the rest}} of the group and they {{converge}} on the barn just as Hershel, Rick, and the other return with the snared walkers. Shane screams that walkers are not people and shoots one of the captive walkers before breaking the locks off the barn doors. Walkers start to file out, and Shane, Andrea, T-Dog (IronE Singleton), Daryl, and Glenn execute the zombies while the others watch. At the last moment, Sophia (Madison Lintz) emerges from the barn, dead and zombified. The group is paralyzed with shock and sadness, unable to act as Sophia walks towards <b>them.</b> <b>Only</b> Rick is able to step forward and shoot her.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{had very}} {{little in the way of}} heavy weapons, as they had {{discarded}} most of their artillery and machine guns due to lack of ammunition. Despite the chronic ammunition shortage von Lettow-Vorbeck was able to move four machine guns up close to the rifle pits, using <b>them</b> <b>only</b> at close range to ensure his ammunition would not be wasted. The inexperience of the Portuguese proved to be their downfall; despite their firing over 30,000 rounds, German casualties were extremely light, including only one casualty among their officers. Taking heavy casualties, having lost their commanding officer, and finding themselves hopelessly outnumbered, the Portuguese finally surrendered despite the fact that they had enough military supplies to continue the action.|$|E

5|$|The Kinder Trespass in 1932 was a {{landmark}} {{in the campaign}} for national parks and open access to moorland in Britain.

The Peak District National Park became the United Kingdom's first national park on 17 April 1951. The first long-distance footpath in the United Kingdom was the Pennine Way, which opened in 1965 and starts at the Nags Head Inn, in Grindsbook Booth, part of Edale village.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Huskies had outscored {{their opponents}} 20337 {{during the regular}} season, {{excluding}} the games against New York and Mississippi. Washington's running backs, George Wilson and Elmer Tesreau, led their offense during the season, each gaining several hundred rushing yards. However, Tesreau was suffering from boils on his knee, and his coaches urged him to not play in the Rose Bowl. The Washington defense was considered superior to that of Navy, being much larger on average. Washington's defense had been very effective during the regular season, holding five teams scoreless and allowing more than ten points to be scored against <b>them</b> <b>only</b> once. Washington's special teams {{were considered to be}} average.|$|E

Over a period of four days, the Viet Cong 9th Division held its ground and mauled the best units the South Vietnamese army could send against <b>them,</b> <b>only</b> breaking after intense attack by U.S. bombers.|$|E
