No. Mr. Speaker, why did they not reveal this? Why did they not act when the House was sitting in January, February, March, and April? They had the information... You concealed the facts, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> you did.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{encounters}} at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some {{feel that}} the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what,</b> for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse for. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not. Bathhouses are still used by {{men who have sex}} with men and do not identify as gay or bisexual, including those that are closeted or in heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is {{reassigned to}} teach at the FBI Academy while Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is given lowly {{surveillance}} assignments. After he investigates extraterrestrial cases at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, Mulder is given a new partner, Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), and meets a secretive informant, X (Steven Williams). Mulder is recruited to assist in a hostage negotiation when Duane Barry, an alien abductee, captures four people. Barry eventually kidnaps Scully, believing that if he brings her to his original abduction site, Skyland Mountain, aliens will take her instead of him. Mulder follows but is delayed by Krycek, who is revealed to be a mole working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). When Mulder reaches Skyland Mountain, Scully is gone. Barry, who insists that aliens took him, dies soon after an interrogation by Krycek. When Krycek vanishes, Skinner re-opens the X-Files, claiming <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> the conspirators will fear most.|$|E

He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness.|$|R
5|$|In season one, Lex hires Roger Nixon (Tom O'Brien), a {{reporter}} for the tabloid newspaper The Inquisitor, to discover how he survived the automobile accident where Clark saved him from drowning. All the evidence points to Clark having been hit by Lex's car, but Lex refuses to believe <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> happened so Nixon attempts to expose Clark to everyone. Around the same time, Lex also enlists the help of Dr. Hamilton (Joe Morton); Hamilton is commissioned to study the effects of the meteor rocks. Hamilton finds an octagonal disc, with unknown symbols imprinted on the disc's surface that match those on Clark's ship, while searching for traces of an alien ship that landed in Smallville in 1989. The disc is eventually stolen by Nixon in an attempt to open Clark's ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads that}} have carried US12 in Michigan {{have been given}} a number of {{memorial}} highway names. In 1922, after the publication of Main Street by Sinclair Lewis that street name took on a pejorative connotation. The newspaper in Jackson advocated that the main road from Detroit to Chicago which formed the main street through many communities in southern Michigan should be given a new name. It was already labeled the Michigan–Detroit–Chicago Highway on travel maps of the time, so the paper suggested that the roadway should be renamed to create the longest street in the country. Both Chicago and Detroit had streets named Michigan Avenue, so <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> the newspaper suggested for a new name. Albion was the first community to change the name of its street followed by Jackson and Marshall in 1924, Battle Creek in 1928 and Kalamazoo in 1929.|$|E

25|$|The sparse Gujarati case system {{serves as}} a {{springboard}} for Gujarati's grammatically functional postpositions, which parallel English's prepositions. It is their use with a noun or verb <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> necessitates the noun or verb taking the oblique case. There are six, one-syllable primary postpositions. Orthographically, they are bound to the words they postposition.|$|E
25|$|Albert, {{whom the}} novel {{identifies}} as Chris's guardian angel, explains that Summerland includes {{many things that}} inhabitants do not need — such as automobiles — but which exist simply because some people believe they are needed.

25|$|In the Sumerian {{version of}} the flood myth, {{the causes of the}} flood and the reasons for the hero's {{survival}} are unknown {{due to the fact that}} the beginning of the tablet describing the story has been destroyed. Nonetheless, Samuel Noah Kramer has stated that it can probably be reasonably inferred that the hero Ziusudra survives due to Enki's aid because <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> happens in the later Akkadian and Babylonian versions of the story.|$|E

25|$|Physicians {{sometimes}} use {{the term}} palliative care in a sense meaning palliative therapies without curative intent, when no cure can be expected (as often happens in late-stage cancers). For example, tumor debulking can continue to reduce pain from mass effect {{even when it is}} no longer curative. A clearer usage is palliative, noncurative therapy when <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> is meant, because palliative care can be used along with curative or aggressive therapies.|$|E
25|$|This relief sculpture, {{in a sense}} {{depicts the}} eclectic {{inclusion}} of various art forms by the Achaemenids, yet their ability {{to create a new}} synthetic form that is uniquely Persian in style, and heavily dependent on the contributions of their subject states. After all, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> distinguishes Achaemenid architecture from those of other kingdoms. It is its originality in context of fusion and inclusion of existing styles, {{in such a way as}} to create awe-inspiring structures.|$|E

In reality, of course, she's working as an undercover agent out to expose a plot to blow up Halifax Harbour in Nova Scotia.

25|$|During {{the treaty}} {{negotiation}} with South Korea, the Japanese government proposed that it pay monetary compensation to individual Korean victims, {{in line with}} the payments to Western POWs. The Korean government instead insisted that Japan pay money collectively to the Korean government, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> occurred. The South Korean government then used the funds for economic development. The content of the negotiations was not released by the Korean government until 2004, although it was public knowledge in Japan. Due to the release of the information by the Korean government, a number of claimants have stepped forward and are attempting to sue the government for individual compensation of victims.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of {{this theory}} of alien genetic-evolutionary {{intervention}} on Earth {{argue that if}} the Greys (or similar beings) were performing genetic manipulations with pre-human life forms on Earth that these aliens may have attempted to influence the evolution of life forms here in a direction consistent with their own genetic makeup, and similar to their own physiology and general physical structure, since genetically <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> they would presumably be most familiar with. Counter to this view, the anatomy, physiology, and genetic makeup of primates and humans are extremely similar to other animals on Earth, including those with divergent non-humanoid forms such as sea urchins, sea squirts, and acorn worms.|$|E
25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying {{and that it}} feels good to think that positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others. People tend to focus on finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> they would like the outcome to be. This also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E
