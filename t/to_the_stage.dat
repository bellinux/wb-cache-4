5|$|After Tyler {{recovered}} from falling off stage, the band returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> in mid-October for two shows in Hawaii, one in Maui which was rescheduled from 2007 and finally played {{as part of}} a legal settlement, and an additional show which was played in Honolulu. In early November, the band played a concert in Abu Dhabi at the Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Although {{initially}} {{planned for}} an East Coast shoot, The Judy Garland Show was taped in Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The network {{had gone to}} great expense to prepare the studio, including an estimated $100,000 to raise the stage and install a separate revolving stage. Garland's dressing room was a 110ft × 40ft trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home. The corridor that led from her dressing room <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> was painted to resemble the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E

5|$|Another {{person to}} testify was Robert Havelka, {{who worked as}} a {{security}} guard the night of the incident. Havelka said that the guardrail was too close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage. He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured. He further said that the fan's fall might have been helped by someone else, perhaps the singer, though he did not see it precisely.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} contest's graphic design, special postcards were {{commissioned}} by the Danish host broadcaster DR to introduce each of the participating countries before the acts took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> For the 2014 contest the contestants were asked to take a photo of their country's flag, made in a creative way. Austria's postcard {{was the first to}} be filmed by DR, and was shot at the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna featuring Wurst and her stylist Tamara Mascara creating the Austrian flag out of 70 baroque-style dresses.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the play, {{the actors}} file out slowly (most {{important}} first, with gaps between actors), and while they are on the bridge (hashigakari), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> after having left. A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E

5|$|Early critics, such as Thomas Campbell in 1838, {{saw this}} {{constant}} {{allusion to the}} theatre as an indication that Prospero was meant to represent Shakespeare; the character's renunciation of magic thus signalling Shakespeare's farewell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> This theory persists among later critics, and remains solidly within the critical canon.|$|E
5|$|For preview screenings, {{the series}} was edited to an 83-minute feature film. The global premiere of the film version was on June 23, 2005, at the Castro Theatre in San Francisco, for the 29th Frameline Film Festival. This was the first {{occasion}} on which the four {{students were able to}} meet. After the screening, the audience greeted director Jeremy Simmons and producer Thairin Smothers with a standing ovation. A second standing ovation followed as Gabbie, T.J., Lucas, and Raci walked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{intends to}} feed Alec the carrot, but {{realizes that he}} is late for the show and rushes off <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> without doing so, much to Alec's chagrin. Presto tries to start the performance, but Alec becomes {{reluctant}} to cooperate until he is given the carrot. After Alec hits his master's hand on the podium he is standing on, Presto then spends {{the rest of the}} show trying to catch Alec through the opening between his top hat and the wizard's hat.|$|E
50|$|The Série A {{served as}} a {{qualifier}} to CONMEBOL's 2014 Copa Libertadores.

5|$|In the Paris of the 1860s, {{despite being}} a Prix de Rome laureate, Bizet {{struggled}} to get his stage works performed. The capital's two main state-funded opera houses—the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent. Bizet's professional relationship with Léon Carvalho, manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company, enabled him to bring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> two full-scale operas, Les pêcheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.|$|E
5|$|In-game {{features}} include large battlefields, {{a large number}} of enemies and officers to defeat, and multiple outcomes for each stage. Certain levels make use of the siege engine (A new feature to the series) and introduce specialized siege equipment such as bridge layers, battering rams and catapults <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> Although it is not essential for the completion of stages, having a siege weapon will increase morale for the player's forces, and help the player succeed.|$|E
5|$|Julius Epstein {{made two}} {{attempts}} {{to turn the}} film into a Broadway musical, in 1951 and 1967, but neither made it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> The original play, Everybody Comes to Rick's, was produced in Newport, Rhode Island, in August 1946, and again in London in April 1991, but met with no success. The film was adapted into a musical by the Takarazuka Revue, an all-female Japanese musical theater company, and ran from November 2009 through February 2010.|$|E

5|$|On January 27, 2009, at {{a public}} sendoff in Phoenix for the Arizona Cardinals before they faced the Steelers in Super Bowl XLIII, Phoenix Mayor Phil Gordon {{produced}} a towel and called the Cardinals mascot, Big Red <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> where he used the towel to wipe his armpits. Gordon then blew his nose on the towel. The Cardinals then proceeded to lose the Super Bowl to the Steelers, 27-23.|$|E
5|$|Pacino {{made his}} return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> in summer 2010, as Shylock in a Shakespeare in the Park {{production}} of The Merchant of Venice. The acclaimed production moved to Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre in October, earning US$1 {{million at the}} box office in its first week. The performance also garnered him a Tony Award nomination for Best Leading Actor in a Play. In October 2012 Pacino starred in the 30th anniversary Broadway revival of David Mamet's classic play, Glengarry Glen Ross, which ran through January 20, 2013.|$|E

5|$|Péraud's time {{remained}} untouched {{until the}} final group of riders set off, and with 's Simon Špilak coming closest to Péraud {{in a time of}} 19' 59", having faded from a similar time at the intermediate point of the Col des Quatre Chemins, the stage battle ultimately came down to the two riders in contention for the overall honours; Wiggins and 's Lieuwe Westra. Westra set off two minutes before Wiggins, and although noted as proficient in the time trial discipline, he left everything on the hill as he set the fastest time to the intermediate checkpoint; recording a time of 11' 29", taking around three seconds per kilometre out of Péraud's time of 11' 47". Two minutes later, Wiggins passed the same point two seconds slower than Westra, but a stronger second half <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> sealed the victory for Wiggins; as the hill flattened, Wiggins' time-trial experience proved pivotal as he overhauled the deficit to Westra, and finished the stage with a two-second advantage over Westra, taking the stage win, overall victory and the points classification in one fell swoop. 's Alejandro Valverde, who had held the lead of the points classification prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> could only muster sixth on the stage, but this result was good enough for him to claim the final remaining place on the podium.|$|E
5|$|Rathbone {{jumped from}} his seat and {{struggled}} with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again grabbed at Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the box <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> a twelve-foot drop; Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box, and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought {{he was part of}} the play.|$|E
5|$|Roekiah {{insisted on}} {{becoming}} an actress, despite {{the opposition of}} her family, and asked her mother for permission to perform on stage. Ningsih agreed, with one condition: Roekiah could only perform once. When the seven-year-old Roekiah took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for the first time, Mohammad Ali– unaware of the agreement between his wife and daughter– rushed on stage and insisted that Roekiah stop singing. Afterwards, she refused to eat until her parents ultimately relented. Roekiah performed regularly afterwards with the troupe.|$|E
