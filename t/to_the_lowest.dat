5|$|Angkor Wat, {{located at}} , {{is a unique}} {{combination}} of the temple mountain (the standard design for the empire's state temples) and the later plan of concentric galleries. The temple is a representation of Mount Meru, {{the home of the}} gods: the central quincunx of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain, and the walls and moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> level.|$|E
5|$|The 1983 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the least}} active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} in 53years, during which only four tropical storms formed. The season officially began on June 1, 1983, and lasted until November 30, 1983. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most storms form in the Atlantic basin. The season had very little activity, with only seven tropical depressions, four of which reached tropical storm strength or higher. This led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> Accumulated Cyclone Energy count since 1950, but not since 1900.|$|E

5|$|Allen again {{weakened}} to a Category4 storm due to friction with Mexico and an eyewall replacement cycle, but restrengthened into a Category5 hurricane for a {{third time}} as it moved over the open waters of the Gulf of Mexico, keeping this intensity for nearly a full day and with a pressure drop <b>to</b> , <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> pressure ever recorded in the western Gulf of Mexico. Shortly before landfall, a dry air mass in the western Gulf of Mexico caused the storm to weaken substantially. Allen made landfall north of Brownsville, Texas as a Category3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 115mph (185km/h). It became extratropical on August 11.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} progressed westward, Tampa and nearby {{locations}} started to experience its effects. Strong winds {{from the northeast}} blew {{water out of the}} Tampa Bay <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> level ever recorded. The barometer fell to 961mbar (hPa; 28.4inHg), and extremely high waves battered the shore from Flamingo to Cape Romano. The surf continued well inland, forcing survivors to cling atop trees. North of Tampa, the hurricane's effects were moderate or light, while in the southwestern part of the state, damage increased in severity. A portion of the local citrus crop was destroyed. Property damage was widespread from Tampa to Jacksonville and points south. High winds tore the roofs off homes and shook some structures off their foundations.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{elected to}} bat first and Brown made 106, while Bradman (65) and Harvey (60) both scored half-centuries. Kent {{collapsed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> {{score of the}} tour in the first innings, succumbing in only 23 overs. Johnston and Loxton both took 3/10, and six local batsmen made ducks. Forced to follow on, half the Kent side were out for 45 in the second innings. Tony Pawson and Godfrey Evans added 71, but the match, held in front of record crowds for the ground, ended inside two days, soon after Evans was run out. It took the Australians less than 56 overs to get 20 wickets. Lindwall took 4/37 in the second innings; all his wickets were top-order batsmen.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the title}} of the episode and the {{invocation}} spoken by the character of Sammael refer to four of the nine choirs of angels in Christian mythology. Christian angelology holds that there are three groupings of three choirs each. The Thrones are the third-highest ranking choir, belonging to the group charged with attending to God, and are described as stern incarnations of holy justice. Dominions, the fourth-highest choir, belong to the group appointed to deal with God's creations. Dominions lead the lower orders and impart wisdom to humanity. Powers belong to the same tier as Dominions, and are tasked with countering the threat of temptation by the devil and demons. Principalities are the seventh-highest ranking choir and belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> grouping of angels, those most likely to appear to mankind. Principalities oversee those humans who rule over others, teaching kings and heads of families the skills needed to lead.|$|E
5|$|By 1950, {{there were}} only about 600 mares and 50 stallions left in the breed. Increasing {{mechanization}} and competition with other livestock hurt the Poitevin, as did a lack of promotion and protection. Between 1970 and 1990, {{the population of the}} Poitevin varied between 250 and 300 animals, with an average of 20 new horses entering the studbook each year. By the early 1990s, population numbers fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> in history. Sources are unclear on the number of living Poitevins in the early 1990s, but by 1996 one author says there were 64 newly registered foals and 28 approved breeding stallions, while another gives a total population of 293 horses in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) was $8.3 billion in 2012, a figure {{expected to rise}} to $15 billion in 2013. In 2012, Fitch Group upgraded Turkey's credit rating to investment grade after an 18-year gap; {{this was followed by}} a ratings upgrade by Moody's in May 2013, as the service lifted Turkey's government bond ratings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> investment grade Baa3. In September 2016, Moody's cut Turkey's sovereign debt to junk status. In the economic crisis of 2016 it emerged that the huge debts incurred for investment during the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government since 2002 had mostly been consumed in construction, rather than invested in sustainable economic growth. Private bank debts in Turkey were 6.6 billion TL in 2002 and had increased to 385 billion TL by the end of 2015.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{pulled out}} of the match against Lithuania, so younger players could gain more {{international}} experience, and to allow him to focus on trying to win Grand Slam titles. His absence was criticised by Davis Cup captain John Lloyd. The Lithuanian side entered the tie as underdogs; fielding a team of teenagers, but Lithuania won 3–2. This {{was the first time that}} Great Britain had lost five ties in a row and was described as a humiliating Davis Cup defeat for Great Britain. It led to the resignation of John Lloyd as Davis Cup captain, with Britain now threatened with relegation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> tier of the competition.|$|E
5|$|Political {{opposition}} in Congress {{also made it}} difficult to build the Pennsylvania-class. The House of Representatives refused to fund any new battleships for the fiscal year 1913, though the Senate would fund two in its comparable bill. They eventually compromised on one, and the battleship that would become Pennsylvania was authorized on 22 August 1912. The ship's plans were given to prospective builders on 20 December; bids were opened on 18 February 1913; and the contract was awarded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> bidder, Newport News, on 27 February 1913 at the quoted price of $7,260,000 without armor or armament. The independent bidding process led the navy to claim $750,000 in savings, but the final cost actually came in at $7,800,000 ($15,000,000 with armor and armament).|$|E
5|$|Taking {{as a wife}} an epikleros who {{had little}} estate was {{considered}} a praiseworthy action, and was generally stressed in public speeches. Such an heiress was called an epikleros thessa. If the nearest male relative {{did not wish to}} marry an epikleros who belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> income class in Athens, he was required to find her a husband and provide her with a dowry on a graduated scale according to his own income class. This dowry was in addition to her own property and the requirement was designed to ensure that even poor heiresses found husbands. The law also did not stipulate what was to happen if the epikleros was still an infant or too young for consummation of the marriage when she was claimed.|$|E

Prominent tributaries of the river are Perche Creek, Hinkson Creek, and Flat Branch Creek. Along these and other creeks in the area can be found large valleys, cliffs, and cave systems such as that in Rock Bridge State Park {{just south of the}} city. These creeks are largely responsible for numerous stream valleys giving Columbia hilly terrain similar to the Ozarks while also having prairie flatland typical of northern Missouri. Columbia also operates several greenbelts with trails and parks throughout town.|$|E
5|$|The {{severity}} of the injury is an important aspect in determining how much sexual function returns as a person recovers. According to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale, an incomplete SCI {{is one in which}} some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the rectum. This indicates that the brain can still send and receive some messages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> parts of the spinal cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with incomplete injury, {{some or all of the}} spinal tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1914 around 53,000 volunteers {{had been}} accepted, {{allowing}} a second contingent to depart in December. Meanwhile, reinforcements were sent {{at a rate of}} 3,200 men per month. The landing at Anzac Cove subsequently resulted in a significant increase in enlistments, with 36,575 men being recruited in July 1915. Although this level was never again reached, enlistments remained high in late 1915 and early 1916. From then a gradual decline occurred, and whereas news from Gallipoli had increased recruitment, the fighting at Fromelles and Pozieres did not have a similar effect, with monthly totals dropping from 10,656 in May 1916 to around 6,000 between June and August. Significant losses in mid-1916, coupled with the failure of the volunteer system to provide sufficient replacements, resulted in the first referendum on conscription, which was defeated by a narrow margin. Although there was an increase in enlistments in September (9,325) and October (11,520), in December they fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> total of the year (2,617). Enlistments in 1917 never exceeded 4,989 (in March). Heavy losses at Passchendaele resulted in a second referendum on conscription, which was defeated by an even greater margin. Recruitment continued to decline, reaching a low in December (2,247). Monthly intakes fell further in early 1918, but peaked in May (4,888) and remained relatively steady albeit reduced from previous periods, before slightly increasing in October (3,619) prior to the armistice in November.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{release of}} the puzzle game Puyo Puyo and replaces all of its {{characters}} with those from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The entirety of gameplay takes place across two grid-based boards: the left board {{is used by the}} player, while the right board is controlled by either artificial intelligence or a second player, depending on the game mode. The main objective of the game is to earn as many points as possible by grouping the same coloured beans together as they fall down on the board. The player must arrange beans into groups of at least four of the same colour; should they do this, the beans in the group will disappear and points will be accumulated. If the player drops a group of beans on an uneven surface, any bean left hanging will separate from the original group and will drop <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> point on the board. The player may also flip a group of falling beans horizontally or vertically.|$|E
5|$|In particular, after 1849, Wagner resented Meyerbeer's {{continuing}} {{success at}} a time when his own vision of German opera had little chance of prospering. After the May Uprising in Dresden of 1849, Wagner was for some years a political refugee facing a prison sentence or worse should he return to Saxony. During his period of living in exile he had few sources of income and little opportunity of getting his own works performed. The success of Le prophète sent Wagner over the edge, and he was also deeply envious of Meyerbeer's wealth. In reaction he published, under a pseudonym, his 1850 essay 'Jewishness in Music'. Without specifically naming Meyerbeer, he interpreted the popular success of the latter as the undermining of German music by alleged Jewish venality and willingness to cater <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> tastes, and attributed the supposed poor quality of such 'Jewish music' to Jewish speech and song patterns, which 'though the cultured son of Jewry takes untold pains to strip them off, nevertheless they shew an impertinent obstinacy in cleaving to him'.|$|E
5|$|Men {{were to be}} enlisted {{into the}} Force by a {{specific}} county association {{and as part of}} a specific corps; if that corps contained multiple units, he was to be posted to one of his choosing. As with the Regular Army, men were not permitted to be transferred from one corps to another or to a regular unit without their consent. Periods of service were not to exceed four years, and could be extended for a further four years {{at the end of that}} period. If the Force was called out for permanent service when the time for a man's discharge came due, he could be required to prolong his service by up to twelve months. A member of the Force could buy his discharge before the end of his term by giving three months notice and paying a sum of up to five pounds, except in times of embodiment for service, and could be discharged for disobedience to orders or misconduct as judged by his commanding officer. First appointments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> grade of officer in any Territorial Force unit were to be given to persons recommended by the association president, provided they fulfilled all the necessary qualifications.|$|E
