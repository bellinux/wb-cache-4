5|$|The <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> <b>Island</b> {{power station}} is near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in the United States. The {{accident}} described in <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> <b>Island</b> began on Wednesday, March 28, 1979, and ultimately {{resulted in a}} partial core meltdown in Unit 2 of the nuclear power plant. Unit 2's pressurized water reactor was of 900 MWe capacity. The scope and complexity of this reactor accident became clear {{over the course of}} five days, as a number of agencies at the local, state and federal levels tried to solve the problem and decide whether the ongoing accident required an emergency evacuation, and to what extent.|$|E
5|$|Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective is a {{scholarly}} {{history of the}} <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> <b>Island</b> accident, written by J.

5000|$|In 2002, the USA {{had what}} former NRC Commissioner Victor Gilinsky termed [...] "its closest brush with disaster" [...] since <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> <b>Island's</b> 1979 meltdown; a workman at the Davis-Besse reactor found a large rust {{hole in the}} top of the reactor {{pressure}} vessel. Recent concerns have been expressed about safety issues affecting a large part of the nuclear fleet of reactors. In 2012, the Union of Concerned Scientists, which tracks ongoing safety issues at operating nuclear plants, found that [...] "leakage of radioactive materials is a pervasive problem at almost 90 percent of all reactors, as are issues that pose a risk of nuclear accidents".|$|R

In China, nuclear power plants try to change from Event Oriented Procedure (EOP) to State Oriented Procedure (SOP) which is a scenario independent approach, developed by French institutes. This paper tries to discuss the principle of the state oriented approach and the composition of SOP. At the same time, comparison between SOP and EOP is made.

5|$|On Earth, {{berkelium}} {{is mostly}} concentrated in certain areas, which {{were used for}} the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests between 1945 and 1980, {{as well as at the}} sites of nuclear incidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster, <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> <b>Island</b> accident and 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash. Analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll), revealed high concentrations of various actinides, including berkelium. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{development}} {{of nuclear power}} in the United States slowed to a halt, as new plants were cancelled or put on hold. The 1983 financial collapse of the Washington Public Power Supply System, a government agency planning to build five large nuclear power plants throughout the state, and the <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> <b>Island</b> accident of 1979 both contributed {{to a decline in}} interest in the university's nuclear program. Student use of the reactor was replaced by commercial use to produce nuclear isotopes for medical use. By 1988, the enrollment in UW's nuclear engineering program shrunk to 23 students, and it was cancelled entirely in 1992.|$|E
40|$|The cyber-physical gap (CPG) is the {{difference}} between the ‘real’ state {{of the world and the}} way the system perceives it. This discrepancy often stems from the limitations of sensing and data collection technologies and capabilities, and is inevitable at some degree in any cyber-physical system (CPS). Ignoring or misrepresenting such limitations during system modeling, specification, design, and analysis can potentially result in systemic misconceptions, disrupted functionality and performance, system failure, severe damage, and potential detrimental impacts on the system and its environment. We propose CPG-Aware Modeling & Engineering (CPGAME), a conceptual model-based approach to capturing, explaining, and mitigating the CPG. CPGAME enhances the systems engineer’s ability to cope with CPGs, mitigate them by design, and prevent erroneous decisions and actions. We demonstrate CPGAME by applying it for modeling and analysis of the 1979 <b>Three</b> <b>Miles</b> <b>Island</b> 2 nuclear accident, and show how its meltdown could be mitigated. We use ISO- 19450 : 2015 —Object Process Methodology as our conceptual modeling framework...|$|R

5|$|More than 1,000 {{shots of}} Wolverine have visual effects in them, which {{required}} three effects supervisors and seventeen different companies {{to work on}} the film. The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> <b>Island</b> and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws. CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not look good in close-ups. Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made, with Matte World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the film—a pullback depicting the destroyed Three Mile Island—and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him {{to find common ground}} between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the adequacy of emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> <b>Island</b> accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E
5|$|This {{exothermic}} reaction is very slow below 100°C, but at temperature above 900°C {{the reaction is}} rapid. Most metals undergo similar reactions. The redox reaction is relevant to the instability of fuel assemblies at high temperatures. This reaction was responsible for a small hydrogen explosion first observed inside the reactor building of <b>Three</b> <b>Mile</b> <b>Island</b> nuclear power plant in 1979, but at that time, the containment building was not damaged. The same reaction occurred in the reactors 1, 2 and 3 of the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant (Japan) after the reactor cooling was interrupted by the earthquake and tsunami disaster of March 11, 2011 leading to the Fukushima I nuclear accidents. After venting the hydrogen in the maintenance hall of those three reactors, the mixture of hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen exploded, severely damaging the installations {{and at least one}} of the containment buildings. To avoid explosion, the direct venting of hydrogen to the open atmosphere would have been a preferred design option. Now, to prevent the risk of explosion in many pressurized water reactor (PWR) containment buildings, a catalyst-based recombinator is installed that converts hydrogen and oxygen into water at room temperature before the hazard arises.|$|E

40|$|CERNA WORKING PAPER SERIES 2012 - 01 This paper {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} innovation in nuclear power reactors between 1974 and 2008 in twelve OECD countries and assesses to what extent nuclear innovation {{has been driven by}} economic incentives, political decisions and safety regulation considerations. We use priority patent applications related to Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) as a proxy for innovating activity. Our results highlight that nuclear innovation is partly driven by the conventional paradigm where both demandpull, measured by NPPs constructions in the innovating country and {{in the rest of the}} world, and technology-push, measured by Research and Development (R&D) expenditures specific to NPPs, have a positive and significant impact on innovation. Our results also evidence that the impact of public R&D expenditures and national NPPs construction on innovation is stronger when the quality of innovation, measured by forward patent citations, is taken into account, and have a long run positive impact on innovation through the stock of knowledge available to innovators. In contrast, we show that political decisions following the <b>Three</b> <b>Miles</b> <b>Island</b> and Chernobyl nuclear accidents, measured by NPPs cancellations, have a negative impact on nuclear innovation. Finally, we find that the nuclear safety authority has an ambivalent effect on innovation. On one hand, regulatory inspections have a positive impact on innovation, one the other hand, regulatory decisions to temporarily close a NPP have an adverse impact on innovation...|$|R

40|$|Accepted version. This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a comparison of media coverage of fusion and fission energy technologies in three countries (Germany, Spain and Portugal) and in the English language international print media addressing transnational elite, from 2008 to 2012. The analysis showed that the accident in Fukushima in March 2010 did not have significant impact on media framing of nuclear fusion in the major part of print media under investigation. In fact, fusion is clearly dissociated from traditional nuclear (fission) energy and from nuclear accidents. It tends to be portrayed as a safe, clean and unlimited source of energy, although less credited when confronted with research costs, technological feasibility and the possibility to be achieved in a reasonable period of time. On the contrary, fission is portrayed as a hazardous source of energy, expensive when compared to research costs of renewables, hardly a long-term energy option, susceptible {{to contribute to the}} proliferation of nuclear weapons or rogue military use. Fukushima accident was consistently discussed in the context of safety problems of nuclear power plants and in many cases appeared not as an isolated event but rather as a reminder of previous nuclear disasters such as <b>Three</b> <b>Miles</b> <b>Island</b> and Chernobyl.

40|$|The goal of SE is {{to enable}} the {{realization}} of successful systems. Common SE practices define how people should use the system, but they disregard the performance limitations of the human operator {{and they do not}} bother {{to make sure that people}} actually use it according to the specification. Typically, system engineers ask usability professionals to make recommendations on usability issues, but usability professionals are typically concerned about ease of use during the initial stage more than about user errors. Users waste time trying to recover from their errors, resulting in productivity loss, reduced satisfaction and accidents. Although the bottleneck of the interaction is the user, engineers typically use to measure the system performance and reliability with the user outside the system boundaries. This article presents a methodology for extended system engineering (ESE). It presents the principles and means for integrating usability in system engineering, so that user errors are eliminated, and their negative effects are reduced.

40|$|Insurers {{have always}} been {{reluctant}} to proffer insurance solution to the nuclear sector, especially since the occurrence of very serious accidents such as Chernobyl and <b>Three</b> <b>Miles</b> <b>Island.</b> However, this sector is particularly monitored {{and most of the}} incidents happening on nuclear sites could be covered by conventional insurers. That is why, underwriters of AXA Corporate Solutions have considered that exploiting this market with adequate limits, by granting third party liability coverage to contractors operating on nuclear power plants, could be profitable and so have decided to hire a trainee to help developing the project. My job, in collaboration with a team of engineers and underwriters of AXA, was first to verify that the market was interesting enough to justify the creation on a new nuclear contract. Then, we had to verify the adequacy of the limits of the contract figured out by AXA engineers to fit with the importance of losses expected. The next stage was to study the most serious incidents in a generic way, in order to verify that none of them would jeopardize the project, and also to facilitate the evaluation of each contracting company: in fact, the activities of each company can be associated with basic components of nuclear power plants, for which we have figured out scenarios of incidents. With the help of these scenarios of incidents, an excel tool has been designed which allows the user to evaluate any contracting company working in the nuclear sector. The evaluation could help judging whether or not offering coverage to a company would be profitable. This tool will also be useful to provide a first idea of the premium to ask to every single company: the determined amounts of premium could next be adapted with additional information from a risk management engineer who would monitor the activities of the studied contracting company. This contract would be first proposed to the contractors of the French nuclear market, and then, if it is a success, it would also be proposed at a global scale. The study focuses especially on PWR (pressurized water reactors), because it is the technology of almost all French reactors. However, as all the nuclear reactor technologies are made on the same principles, this study would have only to be slightly modified, in particular the scenarios, to be suitable also for other technologies...|$|R
