With Churchill's backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honoured.

30|$|Myths {{that involve}} islands or coasts being cut or chopped, {{commonly}} by a giant being wielding a giant tool, {{are common in}} many parts of the Asia-Pacific region and may recall times when large coastal landslides occurred, perhaps triggered by a large-magnitude earthquake. Island-cutting myths are common in parts of Indonesia; the god Atuf is said to have made Borneo into the island it is today by severing its connections with other islands using a giant spear [7]. The Shimane Peninsula (western Honshu, Japan) is said to have been formed when a giant plough was used to slice the land [17] while Meru Mountain, after it was shifted to eastern Java (Indonesia), was trimmed to give it its present shape [47]. On Easter Island (southeast Pacific Ocean), the god named Uoke is said <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>prised</b> pieces off the volcanic cliffs with a giant crowbar until it broke on the hard rocks at Puko Puhipuhi [48]. Hawaiian myths tell of a goddess named Hi’iaka dismembering the body of a dragon-like creature to create coastal lowlands on O’ahu Island, a story that has been reconciled with geoarchaeological evidence [49].|$|R

5|$|The Second Test in Bombay was {{the only}} time that Lindwall was to captain Australia in a Test match. Captain Johnson and his deputy Miller were both injured, leaving the bowling depleted. Ron Archer was injured and {{unavailable}} as Australia bowled first in extremely hot conditions. The situation worsened throughout the match as pacemen Alan Davidson and Pat Crawford were hindered by stomach bugs and hip strains respectively during the game. Leg spinner Richie Benaud could not bowl for part of the match after being affected by a fever and left arm orthodox spinner John Wilson pulled a muscle midway through his debut. This left Lindwall and batting all rounder Ken Mackay as the only fully fit bowling options. Australia bowled out India for 251, before a strong batting effort led by Neil Harvey and Jim Burke, both of whom made centuries, saw Australia make 7/523. Lindwall contributed a hard-hitting unbeaten 48 at the end. Australia's depleted bowling told in the home side's second innings, as the visitors were only able <b>to</b> <b>prise</b> out five wickets and match ended in a draw, with Indian captain Polly Umrigar batting for six hours for a defiant 78. Lindwall finished the tour with scores of eight and 28 in the Third Test in Madras. In a low scoring match in which all four innings finished under 190, Lindwall took match figures of 3/41 in a 94 run victory. It was a successful series for Lindwall, taking 12 wickets at 16.58 and scoring 92 runs at 30.66.|$|E

Williams, on the other hand, blamed BMW for not producing a good enough engine. Williams's failed attempt <b>to</b> <b>prise</b> Jenson Button out of his BAR contract may also have been an issue with Theissen. Despite Frank Williams's rare decision to capitulate to commercial demands by employing German driver Nick Heidfeld when he allegedly preferred Antônio Pizzonia, the fallout between BMW and Williams continued through the 2005 Formula One season. Despite BMW's contract with Williams to supply engines until 2009, this public deterioration of the relationship between BMW and Williams was a factor in the decision by BMW Motorsport to buy Sauber and rebrand that team to feature the BMW name.|$|E

Upon appointing Portuguese manager Bruno Ribeiro, the club's first manager from outside Britain, Smurthwaite stated that: [...] "It has been a long, extensive process but I'm absolutely certain {{we have the right}} man for the job." [...] Smurthwaite then improved the club's budget to allow over ten new, mostly foreign, signings, and stated that he expected Vale to be challenging for the top six and warned his staff that he would enact [...] "plan B" [...] if the club were not in the top six by Christmas. With Vale occupying 17th-place at Christmas, Smurthwaite declared that 'Plan B' had been triggered, meaning the signing of [...] "seasoned, higher grade" [...] players, whilst he admitted he felt [...] "a little bit hoodwinked" [...] as Ribeiro's friends in the game (José Mourinho, Aitor Karanka, and Carlos Carvalhal) had provided him with glowing references but had thus far failed to lend any of their players to the Vale. Ribeiro resigned as manager of Port Vale on 26 December, hours after witnessing his side lose 1-0 at home to Walsall; Smurthwaite put Michael Brown in temporary charge. He also installed Colin Garlick as the club's CEO, and in January stated that [...] "I'm only really involved now when it comes <b>to</b> <b>prising</b> open the sweetie jar for the money".

500|$|When Edward II succeeded {{his father}} Edward I on 7 July 1307, the {{attitude}} of his subjects was generally one of goodwill toward their new king. However, discontent was brewing beneath the surface. Some of {{this was due to}} existing problems left behind by the late king, while much was due to the new king's inadequacies. The problems were threefold. First there was discontent with the royal [...] policy for financing wars. To finance the war in Scotland, Edward I had increasingly resorted <b>to</b> so-called <b>prises</b> [...] or purveyance [...] to provision the troops with victuals. Though a perfectly legitimate method of raising money, the peers felt that the purveyance had become far too burdensome and compensation was in many cases inadequate or missing entirely. In addition, they did not like the fact that Edward II took prises for his household without continuing the war effort against Scotland, causing the second problem. While Edward I had spent the last decade of his reign relentlessly campaigning against the Scots, his son abandoned the war almost entirely. In this situation, the Scottish king Robert Bruce soon took the opportunity to regain what had been lost. This not only exposed the north of England to Scottish attacks, but also jeopardized the possessions of the English baronage in Scotland.|$|R
