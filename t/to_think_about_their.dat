The {{first of its kind}} in the region, the Center provides a unique opportunity for individuals to take an active approach to a healthier life. Truyu Aesthetic Center, with locations in Grand Forks, East Grand Forks and across the region, offers surgical and non-surgical procedures, services and products under the support of Altru. Altru Health System is the result of a 1997 merger of United Hospital (formerly Deaconess and St. Michael's Hospitals) and the Grand Forks Clinic.|$|E
5|$|During the reception, Grace learns {{many things}} {{she did not}} know about Leo, {{including}} that his first name is Marvin (revealed by his mother, Eleanor (Judith Ivey)). So many unsettling details about Leo come to light that Grace becomes uneasy and leaves the reception; Leo follows her. The two run into Katie in the lobby who tells them that The Today Show has scrapped the wedding segment because the judge who performed the ceremony was not licensed in New York so their marriage is not valid. Upon learning this, Grace tells Leo that she needs time <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> relationship. Leo returns to the reception and announces to everyone that his marriage to Grace is not legitimate. Grace returns to the reception later, and reveals that she does want to marry Leo.|$|E

500|$|On a South Pacific island during World War II, two half-Polynesian children, Ngana and Jerome, happily sing as {{they play}} {{together}} ("Dites-Moi"). Ensign Nellie Forbush, a naïve U.S. Navy nurse from Little Rock, Arkansas, {{has fallen in}} love with Emile de Becque, a middle-aged French plantation owner, though she has known him only briefly. Even though everyone else is worried about the outcome of the war, Nellie tells Emile that she is sure everything will turn out all right ("A Cockeyed Optimist"). Emile also loves Nellie, and each wonders if the other reciprocates those feelings ("Twin Soliloquies"). Emile expresses his love for Nellie, recalling how they met at the officers' club dance and instantly were attracted to each other ("Some Enchanted Evening"). [...] Nellie, promising <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> relationship, returns to the hospital. Emile calls Ngana and Jerome to him, revealing to the audience that they are his children, unbeknownst to Nellie.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{performed}} by Sellen et al. (1997) compared event-based and time-based cues on prospective memory tasks. The experimenters gave participants a place (event-based cue) {{and a time}} (time-based cue) and were told to press a button each time those cues appeared during the study. [...] It was found that performance on event-based tasks was better than performance on time-based tasks, even when participants took more time <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> responses. The difference in task performance between {{the two types of}} prospective memory suggests that the intended action was better triggered by external cues of the event-based task than internal cues of the time-based task. External cues, as opposed to internal cues, act as a prompt for better performance, making it easier to complete event-based tasks.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 Stevens fronted the Everyman Testicular Cancer Awareness [...] campaign. Stevens's {{role was}} notable {{as she was}} the first woman to {{represent}} this campaign.

On the commercial, Stevens commented, [...] "Sometimes men need a little encouragement <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> health. This is a funny way of raising awareness about a serious subject." [...] In 2005 Stevens also took part in the Make Poverty History campaign, which aims to eliminate poverty in developing countries by cancelling old debts, improving the way aid is given and removing barriers, so these countries can trade more effectively {{with the rest of the}} world. Stevens donated an undisclosed amount of money to the campaign, and also starred in television and magazine advertisements supporting the cause. Her official website also displayed the campaign's official online banner.|$|E

2500|$|The USA {{considers}} {{support from}} India – {{which is on}} 35-member board of Governors at the International Atomic Energy Agency – crucial in getting a sizeable majority for its proposal to refer the matter to the Security Council for positive punitive action against Iran. Greg Schulte, US ambassador to the IAEA, said [...] "India's voice will carry particular weight...I hope India joins us in making clear our collective concerns about Iran's nuclear programme". Schulte did not deny that the Indo-US nuclear deal was conditional to India supporting the US on the Iran issue. Appraising of the situation vis-a-vis Iran, a senior US official told the New York Times that The Indians are emerging from their non-aligned status and becoming a global power, {{and they have to}} begin <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>their</b> responsibilities.

60|$|When the Indian Mutiny broke out, and {{a little}} time before the siege of Delhi, a {{regiment}} of Native Irregular Horse was stationed at Peshawur on the Frontier of India. That regiment caught what John Lawrence called at the time 'the prevalent mania,' and would have thrown in its lot with the mutineers had it been allowed to do so. The chance never came, for, as the regiment swept off down south, it was headed up by a remnant of an English corps into the hills of Afghanistan, and there the newly-conquered tribesmen turned against it as wolves turn against buck. It was hunted {{for the sake of}} its arms and accoutrements from hill to hill, from ravine to ravine, up and down the dried beds of rivers and round the shoulders of bluffs, till it disappeared as water sinks in the sand--this officerless, rebel regiment. The only trace left of its existence to-day is a nominal roll drawn up in neat round hand and countersigned by an officer who called himself 'Adjutant, late ---- Irregular Cavalry.' The paper is yellow with years and dirt, but on the back of it you can still read a pencil note by John Lawrence, to this effect: 'See that the two native officers who remained loyal are not deprived of their estates.--J.L.'
