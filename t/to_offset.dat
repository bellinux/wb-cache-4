5|$|A June 1965 {{ruling by}} the Kentucky Court of Appeals that {{property}} must be assessed at its full value prompted calls for a special session from Kentucky taxpayers.

5|$|As governor, Wickliffe's {{primary concern}} was the Panic of 1837. He {{advocated}} raising property taxes <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> spending deficits that had climbed to $42,000 by 1839, but the legislature borrowed money to meet the current expenses instead. Wickliffe maintained the state's credit by paying the interest due on state securities. The only areas where he called for more spending were improvements in river navigation, preservation of state archives, and public education. Aside from these concerns, he was inundated with requests for clemency.|$|E

5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} {{its way through the}} {{ratification}} process, Republicans in Congress grew increasingly concerned about the potential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states.

Republicans hoped <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E

Mikami repurposed ideas from P.N.03 in his 2010 game Vanquish.|$|E
