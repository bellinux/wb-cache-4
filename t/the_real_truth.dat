500|$|In 2009, English PEN {{established}} the PEN Pinter Prize, which is awarded annually to a British writer or a writer resident in Britain who, {{in the words}} of Pinter's Nobel speech, casts an 'unflinching, unswerving' gaze upon the world, and shows a 'fierce intellectual determination... to define <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>truth</b> of our lives and our societies'. [...] The prize is shared with an international writer of courage. [...] The inaugural winners of the prize were Tony Harrison and the Burmese poet and comedian Maung Thura (a.k.a. Zarganar).|$|E

This show continues to operate on a level few other series could dream of...". Roger Friedman of Forbes called the LSD sequences with Jane and Roger to be [...] "so well-written {{they were kind of}} transcendent". Salon writer Nellie Engoron acclaimed the episode, while pointing out that [...] "with this episode’s tilt of the seesaw back to the older generation from the flailing youngsters, we’re reminded that while the 1960s saw a cultural shift towards youth, like a drunk, no historical change walks a straight line. For all the claims that Don and others have made that the “kids” increasingly hold the cards, <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>truth</b> (if we’re telling it) is that older white guys like Bert and Roger never truly lost power, even if they began to hide behind the scenes while fresh young faces took the public glory." ...|$|E
500|$|The FairTax {{statutory}} rate, {{unlike most}} U.S. state-level sales taxes, is presented on a tax base {{that includes the}} amount of FairTax paid. For example, a final after-tax price of $100 includes $23 of taxes. Although no such requirement {{is included in the}} text of the legislation, Congressman John Linder has stated that the FairTax would be implemented as an inclusive tax, which would include the tax in the retail price, not added on at checkout—an item on the shelf for five dollars would be five dollars total. The legislation requires the receipt to display the tax as 23% of the total. Linder states the FairTax is presented as a 23% tax rate for easy comparison to income and employment tax rates (the taxes it would be replacing). The plan's opponents call the semantics deceptive. FactCheck called the presentation misleading, saying that it hides <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>truth</b> of the tax rate. [...] Bruce Bartlett stated that polls show tax reform support is extremely sensitive to the proposed rate, and called the presentation confusing and deceptive based on the conventional method of calculating sales taxes. [...] Proponents believe it is both inaccurate and misleading to say that an income tax is 23% and the FairTax is 30% as it implies that the sales tax burden is higher.|$|E

2500|$|The masks {{influence}} the very {{way in which}} realities are categorized. People's theorizing about the world also becomes detached from the relevant contexts, and the interpretation of reality then involves multiple [...] "layers" [...] of meanings, in which [...] "part of the story" [...] hides the [...] "whole story".

2500|$|In June 2015, Tim Hortons {{pulled a}} four-week {{advertising}} campaign by energy company Enbridge from its in-store [...] "Tims TV" [...] service {{after three weeks}} following a petition by the advocacy group, SumOfUs. Even though the ads {{were part of a}} general [...] "Life Takes Energy" [...] campaign introduced by Enbridge the previous year, the group argued that Tim Hortons' airing of the ads implied an endorsement of controversial projects under development by Enbridge, such as the Northern Gateway pipeline, going on to say that [...] "Enbridge's ad campaign uses attractive actors, cute kids and high production values to hide <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>truth</b> — its tar sands project will put ecosystems, salmon and wildlife in danger, create virtually no local jobs, and accelerate climate change." [...] The decision to pull the ads, however, resulted in a boycott of Tim Hortons led by Wildrose Party leader Brian Jean, who felt that the decision was an attack on Alberta's oil industry, as Enbridge is one of the province's top-employing companies.|$|E

Isobel, in whom the love of Truth, however ugly it might be and however destructive of hope, faith, charity and all the virtues, was a burning, inbred passion, took to the secret study of theology in order to find out why Godfrey was so convinced as to the teachings of the Bible. She was not old or mellowed enough to understand that <b>the</b> <b>real</b> reason must be discovered, not in the letter but in the spirit, that is in the esoteric meaning of the sayings as to receiving the Kingdom of Heaven like a child and the necessity of being born again. Therefore with a fierce intensity, thrusting aside the spirit and its promptings which perhaps are shadows of <b>the</b> only <b>real</b> <b>truths,</b> she wrestled with the letter.
