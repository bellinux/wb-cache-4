5|$|Along {{with wind}} direction, cloud cover {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a station model. The circle in the middle of the station model represents cloud cover. In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> is a triangle. If <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> is completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled in. The cloud cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the sky) are covered by cloud. A sky half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black. Below <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> indicating sky cover, the station model can indicate the coverage of low clouds, in oktas, and the ceiling height in hundreds of feet. The ceiling height is the height at which more than half the sky is covered by clouds.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there exist}} {{polynomial}} time algorithms {{to find a}} matrix having given row and column sums, the solution may be far from unique: any submatrix {{in the form of}} a 22 identity matrix can be complemented without affecting the correctness of the solution. Therefore, researchers have searched for constraints on <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> to be reconstructed that can be used to restrict the space of solutions. For instance, one might assume that <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> is connected; however, testing whether there exists a connected solution is NP-complete. An even more constrained version that is easier to solve is that <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> is orthogonally convex: having a single contiguous block of squares in each row and column.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{resampled}} {{convolution method}} that they describe for computing a numerical approximation of the curve-shortening flow, they call their method the resampled curvature scale space. They observe that this scale space is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the given shape, and assert that it uniquely determines <b>the</b> <b>shape</b> and is robust against small variations in <b>the</b> <b>shape.</b> They compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes, {{and find that}} the resampled curvature scale space is less computationally intensive, more robust against nonuniform noise, and less strongly influenced by small-scale shape differences.|$|E
