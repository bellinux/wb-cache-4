2500|$|A {{contemporary}} of Rebbi, therefore (about 160-220)—hardly Rebbi himself—may {{have been}} {{the author of the}} Derek Ereẓ, R., the first three sections being added much later. A collection known as Hilkot Derek Ereẓ existed even in the school of Rabbi Akiva (Ber. 22a); but, as the term [...] "Hilkot" [...] indicates, it was composed entirely of short sentences and rules of behavior and custom, without any references to Jewish Scripture and tradition. It is even highly probable that the treatise was based on the older collection, and that the work of the later editors consisted merely in the addition to the old rules of illustrations from the Bible and from history. For example, in the old collection there was a rule, [...] "No one must enter the house of another without due announcement." [...] This sentence was amplified by a later editor, who added: [...] "This rule of behavior is taught out of the mouth of God Himself, who stood at the gate of paradise and called to Adam, 'Where art thou?'" [...] (Gen. iii. 9); and <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>added</b> the story of a journey of Jewish scholars to Ancient Rome, and how they comported themselves there (section v.).|$|E
50|$|After the Crimean War {{the main}} storage depot, and {{home of the}} RAOC and its predecessors, became the Red Fort at Woolwich. <b>To</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>added</b> the Royal Army Clothing Department at Pimlico when it {{was taken over by}} the AOD in 1895.|$|R

60|$|The theory {{goes on to}} infer, quite correctly, that if {{the actions}} of mankind are {{determined}} in the main by their selfish interests, the only rulers who will govern according to {{the interest of the}} governed, are those whose selfish interests are in accordance with it. And <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>added</b> a third proposition, namely, that no rulers have their selfish interest identical with that of the governed, unless it be rendered so by accountability, that is, by dependence on the will of the governed. In other words (and {{as the result of the}} whole), that the desire of retaining or the fear of losing their power, and whatever is thereon consequent, is the sole motive which can be relied on for producing on the part of rulers a course of conduct in accordance with the general interest.|$|E
60|$|The worst {{feature of}} journalism in West Africa {{is that fair}} play is unknown to it. The negroes may {{thoroughly}} identify themselves with England, claim a share in her greatness, and display abundant lip-loyalty; yet there is the racial aversion to Englishmen in the concrete, and <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>added</b> the natural jealousy of seeing strangers monopolise the best appointments. The Sá Leonite openly declares {{that he and his}} can rule the land much better and more economically than the sickly foreigner, who spends half his service-time on board the steamers and at home. 'Dere goes another white raskel to his grave!' they will exclaim {{at the sight of a}} funeral. 'Wish dey all go and leave colony to US.' And as the reading and paying public is mainly composed of Nigers, the papers must sooner or later cater for their needs, and lose no opportunity of casting obloquy and ridicule upon the authorities and Albus in general. We can hardly blame them. I have shown that the worst and most scandalous display of journalism comes from London.|$|E
60|$|When <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>added</b> the docility {{arising from}} the unaspiring contentment of a limited mind and that {{susceptibility}} of blind attachment sometimes inhering in indisputable inferiors, one readily perceives why those hypochondriacs, Johnson and Byron--it may be, something like the hypochondriac Benito Cereno--took to their hearts, almost {{to the exclusion of}} the entire white race, their serving men, the negroes, Barber and Fletcher. But if there be that in the negro which exempts him from the inflicted sourness of the morbid or cynical mind, how, in his most prepossessing aspects, must he appear to a benevolent one? When at ease with respect to exterior things, Captain Delano's nature was not only benign, but familiarly and humorously so. At home, he had often taken rare satisfaction in sitting in his door, watching some free man of color at his work or play. If on a voyage he chanced to have a black sailor, invariably he was on chatty and half-gamesome terms with him. In fact, like most men of a good, blithe heart, Captain Delano took to negroes, not philanthropically, but genially, just as other men to Newfoundland dogs.|$|E

50|$|A gradual {{assimilation}} {{of the ideas}} of John Cage considerably influenced the development of his music in the later 1960s. <b>To</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>added</b> an interest in tuning and in the harmonic series, as first evident in the orchestral work Clang of 1972, an interest that continued to develop {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|R
50|$|A major {{influence}} on plant systematics was {{the theory of}} evolution (Charles Darwin published Origin of Species in 1859), resulting in the aim to group plants by their phylogenetic relationships. <b>To</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>added</b> the interest in plant anatomy, aided by the use of the light microscope and the rise of chemistry, allowing the analysis of secondary metabolites.|$|R
60|$|The {{working of}} the Senate bears {{little or no}} analogy to that of our House of Lords. In the first place, the Senator's tenure there is not hereditary, nor is it for life. They are elected, and sit for six years. Their {{election}} is not made {{by the people of}} their States, but by the State legislature. The two Houses, for instance, of the State of Massachusetts meet together and elect by their joint vote to the vacant seat for their State. It is so arranged that an entirely new Senate is not elected every sixth year. Instead of this a third of the number is elected every second year. It is a common thing for Senators to be re-elected, and thus to remain in the house for twelve and eighteen years. In our Parliament the House of Commons has greater political strength and wider political action than the House of Lords; but in Congress the Senate counts for more than the House of Representatives in general opinion. Money bills must originate in the House of Representatives, but that is, I think, the only special privilege attaching to the public purse which the Lower House enjoys over the Upper. Amendments to such bills can be moved in the Senate; and all such bills must pass the Senate before they become law. I am inclined to think that individual members of the Senate work harder than individual Representatives. More is expected of them, and any prolonged absence from duty would be more remarked in the Senate than in the other House. In our Parliament this is reversed. The payment made to members of the Senate is 3000 dollars, or 600l., per annum, and to a Representative, 500l. per annum. <b>To</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>added</b> certain mileage allowance for traveling backward and forward between their own State and the Capitol. A Senator, therefore, from California or Oregon has not altogether a bad place; but the halcyon days of mileage allowances are, I believe, soon to be brought to an end. It is quite within rule that the Senator of to-day should be the Representative of to-morrow. Mr. Crittenden, who was Senator from Kentucky, is now a member of the Lower House from an electoral district in that State. John Quincy Adams went into the House of Representatives after he had been President of the United States.|$|E
60|$|A {{mountain}} valley has, at the best, {{a certain}} prison-like {{effect on the}} imagination, but a mountain valley, an Alpine winter, and an invalid's weakness make up among them a prison {{of the most effective}} kind. The roads indeed are cleared, and at least one footpath dodging up the hill; but to these the health-seeker is rigidly confined. There are for him no cross-cuts over the field, no following of streams, no unguided rambles in the wood. His walks are cut and dry. In five or six different directions he can push as far, and no farther, than his strength permits; never deviating from the line laid down for him and beholding at each repetition the same field of wood and snow from the same corner of the road. This, of itself, would be a little trying to the patience in the course of months; but <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>added,</b> by the heaped mantle of the snow, an almost utter absence of detail and an almost unbroken identity of colour. Snow, it is true, is not merely white. The sun touches it with roseate and golden lights. Its own crushed infinity of crystals, its own richness of tiny sculpture, fills it, when regarded near at hand, with wonderful depths of coloured shadow, and, though wintrily transformed, it is still water, and has watery tones of blue. But, when all is said, these fields of white and blots of crude black forest are but a trite and staring substitute for the infinite variety and pleasantness of the earth's face. Even a boulder, whose front is too precipitous to have retained the snow, seems, if you come upon it in your walk, a perfect gem of colour, reminds you almost painfully of other places, and brings into your head the delights of more Arcadian days--the path across the meadow, the hazel dell, the lilies on the stream, and the scents, the colours, and the whisper of the woods. And scents here are as rare as colours. Unless you get a gust of kitchen in passing some hotel, you shall smell nothing all day long but the faint and choking odour of frost. Sounds, too, are absent: not a bird pipes, not a bough waves, in the dead, windless atmosphere. If a sleigh goes by, the sleigh-bells ring, and that is all; you work all winter through to no other accompaniment but the crunching of your steps upon the frozen snow.|$|E
