5|$|Hans Ephraimson-Abt, whose {{daughter}} Alice Ephraimson-Abt had died on <b>the</b> <b>flight,</b> chaired the American Association for Families of KAL007 Victims. He single-handedly pursued three U.S. administrations for answers about <b>the</b> <b>flight,</b> flying to Washington 250 times and meeting with 149 State Department officials. Following {{the dissolution of}} the U.S.S.R., Ephraimson-Abt persuaded U.S. Senators Ted Kennedy, Sam Nunn, Carl Levin, and Bill Bradley to write to the Soviet President, Mikhail Gorbachev requesting information about <b>the</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> {{crew was}} criticised for not {{maintaining}} a sterile cockpit during the landing, with excessive non-flight related discussion going on throughout <b>the</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Hōshō was commissioned, {{experienced}} aircrews requested changes, and {{the ship}} was modified by the Yokosuka Navy Arsenal from 6 June to 20 August 1924. The island, tripod mast, and aircraft crane were removed since they partially obstructed <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> deck and obscured pilot visibility. The forward part of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> deck was made horizontal, and the 8cm AA guns were moved forward, close {{to the position of}} the former island and {{out of the way of}} landing operations. After the island was removed, the carrier's flight operations were controlled from a platform extending from the side of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> deck, a design that would be repeated in subsequent Japanese aircraft carriers. The ship was then assigned to the 1st Fleet until 15 November 1924.|$|E

50|$|The {{arrow shaft}} {{is made from}} wood. A slit is cut at one end to take a pair of card <b>flights,</b> and <b>the</b> other end is given a point. An all-important notch or shallow groove is cut into or around the shaft, just below <b>the</b> <b>flights.</b> After <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> are inserted, <b>the</b> open end of the slit is closed with string or a rubber band to prevent <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> from falling out.|$|R
40|$|In <b>the</b> area of <b>flights</b> delay, {{most of the}} {{research}} done concentrate on developing flight schedules without studying the real reasons for <b>flights</b> delay. <b>The</b> <b>flights</b> delay causes great loss in money and in travelers for the airline companies. In this study, a feed forward multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with two hidden layers type of artificial neural network (ANN) is built to determine <b>the</b> most air <b>flight</b> delay causes, predict <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> delay time and prioritize the factors that affect <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> delay. Most of the delay causes found in this study need good management to minimize the delay time...|$|R
5|$|After the crash, <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> route {{designator}} for Swissair's New York-Geneva route {{was changed}} to Flight 139, still performed by MD-11s. After Swissair's bankruptcy in 2002, Crossair received the international traffic rights of Swissair, and began operating flights as Swiss International Air Lines. At that time <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> designator {{was changed to}} flight LX 023, and operated by Airbus A330-300s.|$|E
5|$|After the deicing {{truck was}} repaired, the pilot {{requested}} a second deicing, though <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> crew {{did not perform}} a walkaround of their airplane, and USAir procedures did not require them to do so. Following the second deicing, LaGuardia ground control granted Flight 405 permission to taxi to Runway 13. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> crew completed the pre-flight checklist during the taxi.|$|E
5|$|All 47 {{passengers}} {{and two of}} the three crew members on board <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> died. Comair released the passenger manifest on August 29, 2006.|$|E
50|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> out of Luxor to Nairobi, Kenya, teams {{may take}} one of two EgyptAir flights to Cairo, both on charter. <b>The</b> first <b>flight</b> was 7:00 am, and <b>the</b> second <b>flight</b> to leave three hours later.|$|R
50|$|In September 2011, it was {{announced}} that HiAir had suspended <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> having not received the delivery of their chosen aircraft due to an issue outlined as 'beyond our control' incurred with their unnamed AOC chosen to operate <b>the</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight's</b> {{role was}} to carry out search and rescue {{operations}} and provide air-sea rescue support to other aircraft during attacks on Japanese targets. <b>The</b> <b>flight's</b> aircraft also conducted offensive operations and dropped supplies {{on behalf of the}} Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit.|$|R
5|$|All 92people {{on board}} were killed, {{including}} David Angell (the creator {{and executive producer}} of the television sitcom Frasier), his wife Lynn Angell, and actress Berry Berenson, the widow of Anthony Perkins. Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane had been scheduled to be on <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> but arrived at the airport late. Actor Mark Wahlberg was also scheduled to be on <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> but canceled his ticket at the last minute. Actress Leighanne Littrell, wife of Backstreet Boys singer Brian Littrell, had also previously been booked on <b>the</b> <b>flight,</b> but like Wahlberg, changed her plans at the last minute.|$|E
5|$|As part of <b>the</b> <b>Flight</b> Day 2 Execute Package, ground {{engineers}} {{also provided}} further {{information on the}} circuit breaker failure seen at launch.|$|E
5|$|CeeCee Lyles {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> attendants on board. In 2003, {{a statue}} of Lyles was {{unveiled}} {{in her hometown of}} Fort Pierce, Florida, which has since gained national recognition as one of the many monuments to the attacks. On August 9, 2007, a portion of U.S.219 in Somerset County, near <b>the</b> <b>Flight</b> 93 National Memorial, was co-signed as <b>the</b> <b>Flight</b> 93 Memorial Highway. At the National September 11 Memorial, the names of the 40 victims of Flight 93 are inscribed on Panels S-67 and S-68 at the South Pool.|$|E
50|$|Several faults were {{observed}} in <b>the</b> three test <b>flights</b> that took place before <b>the</b> accident <b>flight,</b> including flight control problems during <b>the</b> second <b>flight</b> and again during <b>the</b> third <b>flight,</b> on <b>the</b> day preceding the crash.|$|R
50|$|Another four {{unmanned}} VA spacecraft were mated {{together with}} an FGB and launched as TKS spacecraft: <b>the</b> solo <b>flight</b> of Kosmos 929, <b>the</b> Kosmos 1267 <b>flight</b> to Salyut 6 and <b>the</b> <b>flights</b> of Kosmos 1443 and Kosmos 1686 to Salyut 7 - the VA spacecraft on <b>the</b> TKS <b>flight</b> of Kosmos 1686 was modified as a no-reentry laboratory segment.|$|R
50|$|Only Tai-merchants {{could take}} <b>the</b> <b>flights.</b>|$|R
5|$|Dubroff slept {{during one}} of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> {{segments}} en route to Cheyenne, and was assisted by Reid {{in one of the}} landings due to high winds.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{service members}} {{continued}} the hoax, with Burdell's name appearing on various fronts. For example, he was listed on <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> crew of a B-17 bomber, flying twelve missions over Europe with the 8th Air Force in England, until a Georgia Tech graduate became the new operations officer, recognized {{the name on}} <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> log, and ended the charade.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{minutes into}} <b>the</b> <b>flight,</b> the hijackers injured {{at least three}} people (possibly killing one), {{forcibly}} breached the cockpit, and overpowered the captain and first officer. Atta, an al-Qaeda member and licensed commercial pilot, took over the controls. Air-traffic controllers noticed <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> was in distress when the crew was no longer responding. They realized <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> had been hijacked when Mohamed Atta's announcements for passengers were transmitted to air traffic control. On board, flight attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong contacted American Airlines, and provided information about the hijackers and injuries to passengers and crew.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>flight</b> by Orville Wright, of 120 ft in 12 seconds, was {{recorded}} in a famous photograph. In <b>the</b> fourth <b>flight</b> of <b>the</b> same day, Wilbur Wright flew 852 ft in 59 seconds. <b>The</b> <b>flights</b> were witnessed by three coastal lifesaving crewmen, a local businessman, and a boy from the village, making these <b>the</b> first public <b>flights</b> and <b>the</b> first well-documented ones.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Flight's</b> inaugural {{season ended}} with a 1-4 record.|$|R
50|$|Tail: Long and narrow, tightly closed, being {{slightly}} longer than <b>the</b> <b>flights.</b> <b>The</b> tail {{must not be}} carried too low as to touch the ground.|$|R
5|$|Flight 159 was a New York City-Los Angeles flight with an {{intermediate}} stop at Greater Cincinnati Airport. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> operated from New York to Cincinnati without incident.|$|E
5|$|Flight 663's radioed {{good night}} at 6:25p.m. {{was the last}} {{transmission}} received from <b>the</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
5|$|Less than 35minutes into <b>the</b> <b>flight,</b> {{the hijackers}} stormed the cockpit. They forced the {{passengers}}, crew, and pilots {{to the rear}} of the aircraft. Hani Hanjour, one of the hijackers who was trained as a pilot, assumed control of <b>the</b> <b>flight.</b> Unknown to the hijackers, passengers aboard made telephone calls to friends and family and relayed information on the hijacking.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> SAR <b>flight</b> was <b>the</b> last <b>flight</b> {{based at}} RNAS Prestwick.|$|R
50|$|Divided {{into two}} <b>flights,</b> <b>the</b> Operations <b>Flight</b> and <b>the</b> System <b>Flight,</b> <b>the</b> 14 WS {{consists}} {{of more than}} 60 active-duty officers, enlisted personnel and civilians. The majority of the personnel at the 14 WS are meteorologists, weather technicians and computer programmers.|$|R
50|$|Kitty Hawk became world-famous {{after the}} Wright {{brothers}} {{made the first}} controlled powered airplane <b>flights</b> at <b>the</b> Kill Devil Hills, four miles (6 km) south of the town, on December 17, 1903. After <b>the</b> <b>flights,</b> <b>the</b> brothers walked back to Kitty Hawk, where they sent a telegram from the Weather Bureau office to their father informing him of their success. Kitty Hawk is usually credited {{as the site of}} <b>the</b> powered <b>flights</b> because it was the nearest named settlement {{at the time of the}} flight; the modern town of Kill Devil Hills did not exist until 50 years after <b>the</b> <b>flights.</b> <b>The</b> Wrights chose the area because its frequent winds and soft sandy surfaces were suitable for their glider experiments, which they conducted over a three-year period prior to making <b>the</b> powered <b>flights.</b>|$|R
5|$|Lunney worked {{both in the}} Control Center and at remote sites; during <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> of John Glenn, America's first orbital spaceflight, he {{was serving}} as the FIDO in Bermuda. In September 1961, NASA's Space Task Group was reorganized into the Manned Spacecraft Center and moved to Houston, Texas, and Lunney moved with it. In Houston, he became head of the Mission Logic and Computer Hardware section, where he defined and oversaw the {{computing}} and display requirements of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> dynamics division within the new Mission Control Center.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia Airlines {{issued a}} media {{statement}} at 07:24 MYT, one {{hour after the}} scheduled arrival time of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> at Beijing, stating that contact with <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> had been lost by Malaysian ATC at 02:40 {{and that the government}} had initiated search-and-rescue operations; the time when contact was lost was later corrected to 01:21. Neither the crew nor the aircraft's communication systems relayed a distress signal, indications of bad weather, or technical problems before the aircraft vanished from radar screens.|$|E
5|$|Owing to air {{compression}} {{in front of}} the plane as it travelled at supersonic speed, the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300mm (almost 1ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> deck between <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again. To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a heat sink for the heat from the air conditioning. The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.|$|E

50|$|On <b>the</b> second <b>flight,</b> no {{medication}} was given. Seventy-one {{percent of}} those who received alprazolam on <b>the</b> first <b>flight</b> experienced panic as compared with only 29% of those who received a placebo on <b>the</b> first <b>flight.</b> This suggests that the participants who were not medicated on <b>the</b> first <b>flight</b> benefited from <b>the</b> experience via some degree of desensitization.|$|R
