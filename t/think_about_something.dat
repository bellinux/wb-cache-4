2500|$|The analogy he {{provides}} {{to explain his}} theory is that of wood and fire. Wood, he argues, is potentially hot (just as a human is potentially thinking about a universal), and therefore requires something else which is already hot (such as fire) to actualize this. This means that for the human intellect to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>something,</b> the First Intellect must already be thinking about it. Therefore, {{he says that the}} First Intellect must always be thinking about everything. Once the human intellect comprehends a universal by this process, it becomes part of the individual's [...] "acquired intellect" [...] and can be thought about whenever he or she wishes.|$|E

60|$|As {{the effort}} of viewing with care under a bright light a distant object is both {{difficult}} and irksome, and as this effort has been habitually accompanied, during numberless generations, by the contraction of the eyebrows, the habit of frowning will thus have been much strengthened; although it was originally practised during infancy from a quite independent cause, namely {{as the first step}} in the protection of the eyes during screaming. There is, indeed, much analogy, as far as the state of the mind is concerned, between intently scrutinizing a distant object, and following out an obscure train of thought, or performing some little and troublesome mechanical work. The belief that the habit of contracting the brows is continued when there is no need whatever to exclude too much light, receives support from the cases formerly alluded to, in which the eyebrows or eyelids are acted on under certain circumstances in a useless manner, from having been similarly used, under analogous circumstances, for a serviceable purpose. For instance, we voluntarily close our eyes when we do not wish to see any object, and we are apt to close them, when we reject a proposition, as if we could not or would not see it; or when we <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> horrible. We raise our eyebrows when we wish to see quickly all round us, and we often do the same, when we earnestly desire to remember something; acting as if we endeavoured to see it.|$|E
60|$|It is no {{adequate}} {{answer to}} urge that this awful consciousness of a divine presence and supervision {{has ceased to}} be the living fact it once was. That partly explains, but it certainly does not justify, our present lassitude. For the ever-wakeful eye of celestial power {{is not the only}} conceivable stimulus to responsibility. To pass from those grim heroes of protestantism to the French philosophers of the last century is a wide leap in a hundred respects, yet they too were pricked by the oestrus of intellectual responsibility. Their doctrine was dismally insufficient, and sometimes, as the present writer has often pointed out, it was directly vicious. Their daily lives were surrounded by much shabbiness and many meannesses. But, after all, no temptation and no menace, no pains or penalties for thinking about certain subjects, and no rewards for turning to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> else, could divert such men as Voltaire and Diderot from their alert and strenuous search after such truth as could be vouchsafed to their imperfect lights. A catastrophe followed, it is true, but the misfortunes which attended it were due more to the champions of tradition and authority than to the soldiers of emancipation. Even {{in the case of the}} latter, they were due to an inadequate doctrine, and not at all either to their sense of the necessity of free speculation and inquiry, or to the intrepidity with which they obeyed the promptings of that ennobling sense.|$|E

6000|$|In this matter, then, {{as in all}} {{the other}} matters treated in this book, our main {{conclusion}} {{is that it is}} a fundamental point of view, a philosophy or religion which is needed, and not any change in habit or social routine. The things we need most for immediate practical purposes are all abstractions. We need a right view of the human lot, a right view of the human society; and if we were living eagerly and angrily in the enthusiasm of those things, we should, ipso facto, be living simply in the genuine and spiritual sense. Desire and danger make every one simple. And to those who talk to us with interfering eloquence about Jaeger and the pores of the skin, and about Plasmon and the coats of the stomach, at them shall only be hurled the words that are hurled at fops and gluttons, [...] "Take no thought what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink, or wherewithal ye shall be clothed. For after all these things do the Gentiles seek. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you." [...] Those amazing words are not only extraordinarily good, practical politics; they are also superlatively good hygiene. The one supreme way of making all those processes go right, the processes of health, and strength, and grace, and beauty, the one and only way of making certain of their accuracy, is to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> else. If a man is bent on climbing into the seventh heaven, he may be quite easy about the pores of his skin. If he harnesses his waggon to a star, the process will have a most satisfactory effect upon the coats of his stomach. For the thing called [...] "taking thought," [...] the thing for which the best modern word is [...] "rationalizing," [...] is in its nature, inapplicable to all plain and urgent things. Men take thought and ponder rationalistically, touching remote things--things that only theoretically matter, such as the transit of Venus.

He believes that he has [...] "wise blood" [...] that tells him what he is supposed to do by beating against his heart. The park is a special place, he thinks, because the park is in the center of the city and his secret is in the heart of the park. He sees a gray car driving around outside the pool, but his attention is diverted by a woman he watches frequently at the pool, who comes with her two small sons. She is also noticed by another man, who Enoch sneaks behind. The woman pulls down her bathing suit straps, as if to signify that she knows the men are watching her, but otherwise shows no recognition. The other man watching the woman recognizes Enoch, and Enoch realizes the other man (Hazel Weaver), is the person he is supposed to share his secret with. However, Hazel, who is possibly involved in criminal activities, needs Enoch to give him the address of someone Enoch knows, who are involved in his scheme. Enoch uses Hazel's need of him to convince him to come see his secret with him, but Enoch cannot visit the secret without going through his usual ritual, which involves getting a milkshake at a diner called [...] "The Frosty Bottle," [...] walking past all the animals in a small zoo, and finally walking through the museum.|$|R
