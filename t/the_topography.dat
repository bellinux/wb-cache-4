30|$|The {{evolution}} of source characteristics of acoustic emission (AE) events and <b>the</b> surface <b>topography</b> of <b>the</b> fault surface during frictional sliding were investigated {{with the aim}} of improving current understanding of the microscopic process of friction. Both the AE source dimensions and <b>the</b> grain-scale <b>topographies</b> were well conserved against abrasion during the sliding, but the magnitude of stress drop was significantly reduced. <b>The</b> fractal-domain <b>topographies,</b> <b>the</b> wavelength of which is shorter than the fractal limit wavelength (λc), were significantly worn during the sliding. These results suggest that <b>the</b> grain-scale <b>topography</b> determined <b>the</b> AE source dimension, while the fractal-domain asperities controlled the magnitude of the stress drop. Since elastic wave radiation {{is one of the major}} energy consumption processes, the grain-scale and <b>the</b> fractal-domain <b>topographies</b> may play different roles, not only in the AE source process but also in the friction of rocks.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of erosion of {{sandstone}} and the erosion-resistant sills and dikes, <b>the</b> <b>topography</b> in Minnesota has repeated parallel hills and valleys. The tightly packed lakes in the narrow valleys are long and narrow, and they orient from the east to west. The cliffs in these narrow valleys are the habitat to several rare plants which prefer living in narrow cliff areas in a sub-Arctic climate. In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlain by a thick diabase cap.|$|E
5|$|Downcutting and canyon {{widening}} continue {{today as}} the process of erosion continues to try to reduce <b>the</b> <b>topography</b> to sea level. In 1998 a flash flood temporarily increased the Virgin River's flow rate from 200 to 4,500ft³/s (6 to 125m³/s). Geologists estimate that the Virgin River can cut another thousand feet (300m) before it loses the ability to transport sediment to the Colorado River to the south. However, additional uplift will probably increase this figure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Due to the induced {{effect of}} plastic {{deformation}} and markedly influence of contact friction, <b>the</b> surface <b>topography</b> of galvanized steels has changed along {{with time and}} space during the sheet metal forming.

And <b>the</b> surface <b>topography</b> models of different deformation zones were established based on the statistical method. The results indicated that <b>the</b> surface <b>topography</b> was roughened with the increase of deformation and the degrees of roughening in different deformation zones were different. The function curve of micro-peak height in punch fillet zone which had serious deformation was relatively flat. It indicated that the data distributions were scattered, the roughness values were large and the zinc coating was severely exfoliated. However, the function curve in vertex zone was lanky with centralized data, small roughness values and intact zinc coating. Moreover, <b>the</b> surface <b>topography</b> was also affected by the contact friction...|$|R

30|$|When {{evaluating}} the gene expression trends {{observed in the}} macrophages, there was a highly significant increase in TNF-α expression for <b>the</b> 50 -nm <b>topography.</b> For all of <b>the</b> <b>topographies,</b> there was limited impact on the expression of CCL- 3 and CCL- 2, whereas, there was a mild elevation in IL- 6 expression. Taken together, there was a limited induction of an inflammatory response for these <b>topographies.</b> <b>The</b> expression of PAI- 1, VEGF, and PECAM were also evaluated, and there were low levels of expression for all genes in all <b>topographies</b> except for <b>the</b> 200 -nm <b>topography,</b> which displayed significant increases in PAI- 1 expression. Since PAI- 1 helps to prevent blood clots and the buildup of cells, in conjunction with data from the gene expression studies where limited immune responses were observed, <b>the</b> 200 -nm <b>topography</b> might assist {{in the prevention of}} foam cell formation.|$|R

5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between <b>the</b> <b>topography</b> and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E

When <b>the</b> experimentally measured <b>topography</b> and <b>the</b> error signals are considered uncorrelated entities, both will depend in a very strong way on these parameters.

A numerical model was developed in order to predict <b>the</b> surface <b>topography</b> and surface roughness of machined parts.

Owing to <b>the</b> <b>topography</b> of their elevated sites it was often necessary to approach churches by many steps; these steps were often transformed into long straight marble staircases, in themselves decorative architectural features (illustration 19), in the manner of the Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E
