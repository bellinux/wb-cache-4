Gracehope was formed hundreds of years ago by a group called <b>the</b> <b>Settlers</b> who used to live in England. They possessed unusual abilities, such as extremely good vision and hearing, leading them to be called 'eye adepts' and 'ear adepts', respectively. These powers were seen as sorcery, prompting Grace, the leader of <b>the</b> <b>Settlers,</b> to bring <b>the</b> <b>Settlers</b> under the ice in Greenland where they could live in peace.|$|E
5|$|In 1779, the Comanches began raiding the Bucareli area, and <b>the</b> <b>settlers</b> {{chose to}} move further {{east to the}} old mission of Nacogdoches, where they founded the town of the same name. The new town quickly became a waystation for contraband. <b>The</b> <b>settlers</b> did not have {{authorization}} to move, and no troops were assigned to protect the new location until 1795.|$|E
5|$|The Pied-Noir {{relationship}} with France and Algeria {{was marked by}} alienation. <b>The</b> <b>settlers</b> considered themselves French, {{but many of the}} Pieds-Noirs had a tenuous connection to mainland France, which 28 percent of them had never visited. <b>The</b> <b>settlers</b> encompassed a range of socioeconomic strata, ranging from peasants to large landowners, the latter of whom were referred to as grands colons.|$|E

5|$|After {{the arrival}} of white {{settlers}} to the baytown of Hynesville in the 19th century, the Karankawa began to commit offenses against <b>the</b> <b>settlers,</b> including the unsanctioned slaughter of their livestock. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>settlers</b> engaged the Indians at the 1852 Battle of Hynes Bay, near the San Antonio Bay extension of Hynes Bay. The Karankawa were swiftly defeated, and the survivors agreed to never return; finding refuge across the Rio Grande in Tamaulipas. A few years later, the Hynes extension began to fill with mud, leaving it shallow and hard to navigate. Reports from Hynesville suggest that alligators infested the bay, killing a few residents.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of November 1846, <b>the</b> <b>settlers</b> had reached the Sierra Nevada where they became trapped by an early, heavy snowfall near Truckee (now Donner) Lake, high in the mountains. Their food supplies ran extremely low and, in mid-December, some of the group set out on foot to obtain help. Rescuers from California attempted to reach <b>the</b> <b>settlers,</b> but the first relief party did not arrive {{until the middle of}} February 1847, almost four months after the wagon train had become trapped. Of the 87 members of the party, 48 survived to reach California, many of them having eaten the dead for survival.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Nowadays the {{mathematical}} models of <b>the</b> secondary <b>settlers</b> are intensively developed. As a rule the engineers use the 0 -D models or 1 -D models to design settlers. But these models {{do not take}} into account the hydrodynamics process inside <b>the</b> <b>settler</b> and its geometrical form. That is why the CFD-models based on Navier - Stokes equations are not widely used in practice now. The use of CFD-models based on Navier - Stokes equations needs to incorporate very refine grid. It is very actually now to develop the CFD-models which permit to take into account the geometrical form of <b>the</b> <b>settler,</b> <b>the</b> most important physical processes and needs small computer time for calculation. That is why the development of the 2 -D numerical model for the investigation of the waste waters transfer in <b>the</b> vertical <b>settlers</b> which permits to take into account the geometrical form and the constructive features of <b>the</b> <b>settler</b> is essential. Methodology. The finite - difference schemes are applied. Findings. The new 2 -D-CFD-model was developed, which permits to perform the CFD investigation of <b>the</b> vertical <b>settler.</b> This model takes into account the geometrical form of <b>the</b> <b>settler,</b> <b>the</b> central pipe inside it and others peculiarities. The method of «porosity technique» is used to create the geometrical form of <b>the</b> <b>settler</b> in <b>the</b> numerical model. This technique permits to build any geometrical form of <b>the</b> <b>settler</b> for CFD investigation. Originality. Making of CFD-model which permits on the one hand to take into account the geometrical form of <b>the</b> <b>settler,</b> basic physical processes of mass transfer in construction and on the other hand requiring the low time cost in order to obtain results. Practical value. CFD-model is designed and code which is constructed on its basis allows at low cost of computer time and about the same as in the calculation of the 1 -D model to solve complex multiparameter problems that arise during the design of vertical settlers with their shape and design features...|$|R

Caldwell instructed Smither to bring Castañeda to the town the following morning to discuss the matter. At roughly the same time, Moore called a war council, which quickly voted to initiate a fight. It is unclear whether the war council was aware that Caldwell had promised Castañeda safe passage to Gonzales the next morning.|$|E

40|$|The {{behavior}} of the dispersion band in <b>the</b> <b>settler</b> of a pilot scale mixer-settler unit is analyzed.

5|$|The {{attack at}} Sinsinawa Mound, {{compounded}} by other incidents around the region, helped {{contribute to the}} fear gripping <b>the</b> <b>settlers.</b> The people of Platteville, in present-day Wisconsin, contemplated fleeing to Galena, about 25 miles (40 km) south, {{as a direct result}} of the Sinsinawa Mound raid. Colonel Dodge dispatched one of his men, Frederick Hollman, to Platteville to reassure its nervous residents. However, by the time Hollman arrived <b>the</b> <b>settlers</b> had already been informed that the local Native American Ho-Chunk tribesmen were friendly. This and the subsequent delivery of promised supplies from Galena further placated Platteville's residents, and the threatened exodus was called off.|$|E

Strode in Galena to General Henry Atkinson at Dixon's Ferry (present-day Dixon, Illinois). The group of men, which included soldiers Fred Stahl, William Durley, Vincent Smith, Redding Bennett, James Smith, and mail contractor John D. Winters, left Dixon around 3 p.m. on May 19.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the paper is to support and illustrate recent theoretical results on the mathematical modelling of the secondary clarifier. A new settler model is compared with a traditional layer model by means of numerical simulations. Emphasis is put on the numerical solution's ability to approximate the analytical solution of the conservation law written as a non-linear partial differential equation. <b>The</b> new <b>settler</b> model is consistent in this respect. Another important conclusion is that a layer model dividing <b>the</b> <b>settler</b> into only ten layers (normally used in settler models) is too crude an approximation to capture the detailed dynamic behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>settler.</b> All simulations presented are performed with <b>the</b> <b>settler</b> models coupled to the IAWQ Activated Sludge Model No. 1...|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of recorded American history, the Harrisburg area was inhabited by several Algonquian tribes, including the Shawnee and Piankashaw, {{who lived in the}} dense inland forests. Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the Piankashaw tribe was driven out by the more aggressive Shawnee. European settlement in Illinois began with the French from 1690 and reached its peak about 1750, mainly along the Mississippi River. American settlers arrived in 1790. The French came as merchants and missionaries, with farming supplementing the need for trade. The result had benefited both <b>the</b> <b>settlers</b> and the Native Americans. The American migration, however, followed treaties which resulted in land being distributed through American Law, ignoring previous indigenous rights. Encroachment ensued and caused hard feelings between the Indians and <b>the</b> <b>settlers</b> who moved into the interior and along migration routes. Many of the Indians allied themselves with the British to resist, though trade with the Americans was an important reason why the Native Americans remained largely peaceful.|$|E
