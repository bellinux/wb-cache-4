25|$|Vacuum tubes mostly rely on {{thermionic}} emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament. This type {{is called a}} thermionic tube or <b>thermionic</b> <b>valve.</b> A phototube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. Not all electronic circuit valves/electron tubes are vacuum tubes (evacuated); gas-filled tubes are similar devices containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, usually without a heater.|$|E
25|$|Valve electrometers use a {{specialized}} vacuum tube (<b>thermionic</b> <b>valve)</b> {{with a very}} high gain (transconductance) and input resistance. The input current is allowed to flow into the high impedance grid, and the voltage so generated is vastly amplified in the anode (plate) circuit. Valves designed for electrometer use have leakage currents as low as a few femtoamperes (10−15 amperes). Such valves must be handled with gloved hands as the salts left on the glass envelope can provide leakage paths for these tiny currents.|$|E
25|$|In 1886 Ediswan moved {{production}} {{to a former}} jute mill at Ponders End, North London. In 1916 Ediswan set up the UK's first radio <b>thermionic</b> <b>valve</b> factory at Ponders End. This area, with nearby Brimsdown subsequently developed as a centre for the manufacture of thermionic valves, cathode ray tubes, etc. and nearby parts of Enfield became an important centre of the electronics industry {{for much of the}} 20th century. Ediswan became part of British Thomson-Houston and Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) in the late 1920s.|$|E

25|$|It was {{not until}} 1928 that Geiger and Walther Müller (a PhD student of Geiger) {{developed}} the sealed Geiger-Müller tube which developed the basic ionization principles previously used experimentally. This was relatively small and rugged, and could not only detect alpha and beta radiation such as prior models but also gamma radiation. Now a practical radiation instrument could be produced relatively cheaply, and so the Geiger-Muller counter was born. As the tube output required little electronic processing, a distinct advantage in the <b>thermionic</b> <b>valve</b> era due to minimal valve count and low power consumption, the instrument achieved great popularity as a portable radiation detector.|$|E
500|$|Abbey Road {{was also}} the first and only Beatles album to be entirely {{recorded}} through a solid state transistor mixing desk, the TG12345 Mk I, as opposed to earlier <b>thermionic</b> <b>valve</b> based REDD desks. The TG console also allowed better support for eight-track multitrack recording, helping the Beatles' considerable use of overdubbing. Emerick recalls the TG desk used to record the album had individual limiters and compressors on each audio channel and noted the overall sound was [...] "softer" [...] than the earlier valve desks.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{distinctive}} effect was the dramatic rocket take-off, which was {{played at the}} beginning of each episode, and whenever necessary during the episodes. This was actually a recording of a jet aircraft at Heathrow airport. Often, this would be followed by a slowly ascending tone (representing the rocket accelerating), which [...] "was actually a recording of a <b>thermionic</b> <b>valve</b> played through an echo chamber down at the Physical Research Laboratory at Kingston". Other sound effects were created at Battersea Power Station, and the sound made by the televiewer on board Luna was actually a naval ASDIC.|$|E
50|$|The Tommy Flowers-built Colossus (1943) and the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (1942) used <b>thermionic</b> <b>valves</b> (vacuum tubes) and binary {{representation}} of numbers. Programming was {{by means of}} re-plugging patch panels and setting switches.|$|R

50|$|The Robinson {{machines}} were limited in speed and reliability. Tommy Flowers of the Post Office Research Station, Dollis Hill had experience of <b>thermionic</b> <b>valves</b> and built an electronic machine, the Colossus computer which {{was installed in}} the Newmanry.

50|$|The {{control grid}} is an {{electrode}} used in amplifying <b>thermionic</b> <b>valves</b> (vacuum tubes) {{such as the}} triode, tetrode and pentode, used to control the flow of electrons from the cathode to the anode (plate) electrode. The control grid usually consists of a cylindrical screen or helix of fine wire surrounding the cathode, and is surrounded in turn by the anode. The control grid was invented by Lee De Forest, who in 1906 added a grid to the Fleming <b>valve</b> (<b>thermionic</b> diode) to create the first amplifying vacuum tube, the Audion (triode).|$|R
50|$|A {{transistor}} is a {{semiconductor device}} {{with at least}} three terminals for connection to an electric circuit. The vacuum-tube triode, also called a (<b>thermionic)</b> <b>valve,</b> was the transistor's precursor, introduced in 1907.|$|E

50|$|Cunife is an alloy {{of copper}} (Cu), nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), {{and in some}} cases cobalt (Co). The alloy has the same linear {{coefficient}} of expansion as certain types of glass, and thus makes an ideal material for the lead out wires in light bulbs and <b>thermionic</b> <b>valves.</b> Fernico exhibits a similar property. It is a magnetic alloy and can be used for making magnets.|$|R
50|$|Until the {{invention}} of the transistor in 1947, most practical high-frequency electronic amplifiers were made using <b>thermionic</b> <b>valves.</b> The simplest valve was invented by John Ambrose Fleming while working for the Marconi Company in London in 1904 and named the diode, as it had two electrodes. The diode conducted electricity in one direction only and was used as a radio detector and a rectifier.|$|R
