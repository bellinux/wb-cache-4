60|$|He moved a few steps, {{then there}} was a stumble and a sudden cry. I saw him for a moment {{slipping}} down the slanted surface of the rock, and when I reached the edge he hung apparently with one foot on a slippery stone, and his left hand clawing wildly at the snow, which yielded under it. I think his other fingers were in a crevice. The fall might not be <b>dangerous</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> but it seemed impossible that anybody launched upon that declivity could escape a glissade over the precipice. This struck me in an instant and, grasping a shrub which grew in a crevice, I held out my right hand toward him.|$|R

Reasons for this include the fact that the use of cannabis has generally been much less common in Finland than in other EU countries, and that the tradition of [...] "drug education", based mainly in intimidation and modeled after practices from the United States and Sweden, is still quite strong in schools and the media. According to the traditional Finnish mindset, it is preferable to lose control with alcohol or to even use it excessively over long periods of time, than to experiment with cannabis, which is seen both as very <b>dangerous</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself</b> and as a [...] "gateway drug".|$|R

Other brownies left households or farms because they heard a complaint, or a compliment. People who saw the fairies were advised not to look closely, because they resented infringements on their privacy. The need to not offend them could lead to problems: one farmer found that fairies threshed his corn, but the threshing continued after all his corn was gone, and he concluded that they were stealing from his neighbors, leaving him the choice between offending them, <b>dangerous</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> and profiting by the theft.|$|R

50|$|As a {{training}} tool, the water ramp can be invaluable to preventing injuries on snow, but <b>dangerous</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> Novices typically fear {{falling on the}} in-run, and they are frequently unprepared for the compression that occurs {{at the end of}} the in-run and the beginning of the kicker. Awkward landings from high jumps can render skiers unconscious, making the presence of a lifeguard mandatory. Although the pool's bubbles do reduce impacts injuries to arms, legs, and backs can occur. More commonly for jumpers landing long or short in rotation, have their wind knocked out. For advanced athletes traveling faster on the double and triple kickers, the most dangerous part is at the take off. If the skier were to catch an edge on the final few meters of the ski surface they are particularly vulnerable and can hit their backs or heads on the jump creating tremendous impact. Fortunately these events are rare and can be mitigated by proper installation and frequent inspection of the kicker's ski surface.|$|R

The consuls of France and Germany at Salonica were murdered by the Turkish mob. Servia and Montenegro were in arms. Moved by these symptoms of a vast conflagration, the three imperial courts of Russia, Austria, and Germany agreed upon an instrument imposing on the Turk certain reforms, to be carried out under European supervision. To this instrument, known as the Berlin memorandum, England, along with France and Italy, was invited to adhere (May 13).

40|$|Situs viscerum inversus totalis {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} presenting {{with complete}} transposition of thoracic and abdominal viscera. It is associated with certain organ anomalies, {{but it is not}} a predisposing factor to cholecystolithiasis. To date, fewer than 100 cholecystectomies in patients with situs inversus have been published worldwide. We report a case of a 75 -year-old woman referred to our hospital with abdominal pain in the left hypochondrium. Situs inversus totalis and acute calculous cholecystitis were diagnosed and successfully conservatively treated with antibiotics. The patient underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy 3 months later. The procedure and postoperative course were uneventful and the patient recovered well. The clinical presentation of these patients with cholecystolithiasis may be confusing and vague and the correct diagnosis delayed. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the gold standard in the treatment even though the operation requires some modifications in operating theatre arrangement and position of the surgical team. Most surgeons are right-handed, and to operate laparoscopically in the ‚Äúmirror image ‚Äù anatomi-cal situation using mainly the left hand for dissection may be stressful, uncomfortable and more time-consuming. Some recommendations to overcome this issue have been published. In conclusion, the above-mentioned anomaly may cause some risk and delay of the exact diagnosis, but it is not <b>dangerous</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself.</b> Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe procedure, even in the case of acute cholecystitis, if performed by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. The most dangerous is always an incautious and too self-confident surgeon. Key words: acute cholecystitis, elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, situs viscerum inversus totalis...|$|R

50|$|Although {{forms of}} {{pre-packaged}} paper cartridges {{go back to}} the Middle Ages, their extra cost and small benefit to civilian users discouraged wide-spread adoption of them except for militia duty. For example, on April 19, 1775, in Lexington and Concord, paper cartridges were routinely used by many civilians on the opening day of the American Revolutionary War. Similarly, the British soldiers there carried cartridge boxes holding 36 paper cartridges. The advantage of paper cartridges was speed; 3 to 4 rounds a minute were possible using paper cartridges. Measuring each charge before firing reduced the rate of fire to about one round per minute. There were other methods, including small cloth bags containing the correct amount of powder for a single shot, that might be carried on a bandolier (again requiring a container for a supply for refilling). An important safety concern was that when reloading a muzzle-loading gun soon after a shot there might be small pieces of wadding burning in the muzzle, which would cause the new load of powder to ignite as a flash. So long as no part of the loader faced the end of the barrel this was not <b>dangerous</b> <b>in</b> <b>itself,</b> but if a spark reached the main supply in the powder flask a fatal explosion was likely. Various precautions were taken, both in the design and use of powder measures used with flasks, or in the flasks themselves, to prevent this from happening. The inside and outside of a powder horn were often polished to make the horn translucent so that the soldier would be able to see how much powder he had left.|$|R
