5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Wu {{wrote the}} {{patriotic}} war play City of Phoenix (凤凰城), {{which made him}} well-known in China at age 20. It {{was one of the}} most performed dramas during the eight-year war. He later wrote several critically acclaimed plays, including Return on a Snowy Night, which is generally considered his masterpiece. His works are strongly influenced by the May Fourth New Culture Movement.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the war, Frederick {{had one of}} {{the finest}} armies in Europe: his troops—any company—could fire at least four volleys a minute, and some of them could fire five. By the end of 1757, {{the course of the war}} had gone well for Prussia, and poorly for Austria. Prussia had {{achieved}} spectacular victories at Rossbach and Leuthen and reconquered parts of Silesia that had fallen to Austria.|$|E
5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the 1906 season, the Ohio–Pennsylvania League had trimmed {{down to a}} more {{manageable}} eight teams. Departing teams included franchises from Barberton, Braddock, Bucyrus, Butler, Canton, Homestead, Kent, Lima, Massillon, McKeesport, Mount Vernon, Niles, Steubenville, Washington, and Wooster. At the same time, the league attracted new teams from New Castle, Pennsylvania, and Mansfield, Ohio.|$|E

5|$|Held at a {{price of}} C$829 million, the Calgary Olympics cost more to stage than any {{previous}} Games, summer or winter. The high cost was anticipated, as organizers were aware at <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> their bid that most facilities {{would have to be}} constructed. The venues, constructed primarily with public money, were designed to have lasting use beyond the Games and were planned to become the home of several of Canada's national winter sports teams.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, McCreary {{was one of}} four men, all former Confederate soldiers, {{who sought}} the Democratic gubernatorial nomination—the others being John Stuart Williams, J. Stoddard Johnson, and George B. Hodge. Williams was {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination at <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the Democratic nominating convention, despite attacks on his character by newspapers {{in the western part of}} the state. However, McCreary defeated Williams on the fourth ballot.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council {{approved}} MC 48, a key {{document in}} the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO would have to use atomic weapons from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> a war with the Soviet Union whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first. This gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic use of nuclear weapons as existed for the commander-in-chief of the US Strategic Air Command.|$|E

Alcohol supplies consisted of 250 barrels of beer, 44 barrels of brandy and 17 barrels of rum.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the actors}} were {{specialised}} comedians, notably Joseph Haines who played the false-wit character Sparkish, Alithea's original fiancé. At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> his high-profile career as comedian and song-and-dance man, young Haines already {{had a reputation for}} eccentricity and dominant stage presence, suggesting that Sparkish is not merely a comic butt for the truewits Horner, Harcourt, and Dorilant to mock, but also a real threat to the romance of Harcourt and Alithea.|$|E
5|$|Some rulers {{handled this}} {{arrangement}} with less subtlety than others. Domitian {{was not so}} subtle. From <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> his reign, he stressed the reality of his autocracy. He disliked aristocrats and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.|$|E

5|$|After her World War I service ended, Siboney was {{returned}} to the Ward Line and placed in New York–Cuba–Spain transatlantic service; the liner ran aground at Vigo, Spain in September 1920. Despite considerable damage, she was repaired and placed back in service. In late 1921, Siboney was switched to New York–Cuba–Mexico routes, which were a popular and inexpensive way for Americans to escape Prohibition. In late 1940, she was chartered to American Export Lines to return Americans fleeing Europe at <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> World War II, making seven roundtrips from Jersey City, New Jersey, to Lisbon.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1847, Palmer {{traveled}} {{with his family}} to Oregon as captain of that year's major wagon train. While passing through the Walla Walla Valley he met Marcus and Narcissa Whitman at their mission shortly before their deaths in the Whitman massacre—the event that precipitated the Cayuse War. Perhaps motivated by meeting the Whitmans, Palmer later returned to serve as a peace commissioner to tribes considering joining the Cayuse. At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the war he was appointed as commissary-general of the Provisional Government’s militia forces.|$|E
50|$|From <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>the</b> {{education}} <b>of</b> {{the children}} was given top priority, and from 1892 the boys' school, and from 1898 the girls' school were administered strictly under government regulations, and the institution received {{a share of}} the Parliamentary Grant from the Education Department.|$|R

5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the original interest, but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century {{most of the}} European {{settlements}} {{were related}} to the fur trade. The largest of these settlements were trading posts established by the North West Company, particularly those at Sandy Lake, Leech Lake, and Fond du Lac. Historian Grace Lee Nute has documented over 100 fur trading posts of varying sizes in the Minnesota area before statehood. Most of these posts were eventually taken over by the American Fur Company. When several hundred settlers abandoned the Red River Colony in the 1820s, they entered the United States by way of the Red River Valley, instead of moving to eastern Canada or returning to Europe, adding to the Minnesota region's population.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the 2006 season, Sanchez {{competed for}} the {{starting}} quarterback position; once Booty, a junior, suffered severe back spasms caused by a pre-existing back condition, surgery was required and Sanchez was promoted to run the first-team offense during the spring as Booty recovered. Coaches stated Booty would be considered {{the starting quarterback}} when he returned for fall practice. During the 2006 season, Sanchez saw limited playing time in games against Arkansas, Stanford and Oregon. Through those three games, Sanchez completed 3 of his 7 pass attempts for 63 yards and one interception. He also saw additional action against Arizona, Michigan, and Notre Dame {{but he did not}} attempt a pass in those contests.|$|E

50|$|From <b>the</b> <b>outset,</b> <b>the</b> {{formation}} <b>of</b> the USC {{came in for}} widespread criticism, {{not only}} from Irish nationalists, but also from elements of the British military and administrative establishment in Ireland and the British press, who saw the USC as a potentially divisive and sectarian force.|$|R

5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the Korean War, Leyte {{was ordered}} to the Korean Peninsula, {{arriving}} in October 1950. Brown, an ensign, flew 20 combat missions before his F4U Corsair aircraft came under fire and crashed on a remote mountaintop on 4 December 1950 while supporting ground troops at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Brown died of his wounds {{despite the efforts of}} wingman Thomas J. Hudner, Jr., who intentionally crashed his own aircraft in a rescue attempt, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in {{the second}} half of the 16th century, Poland–Lithuania became an {{elective}} monarchy, in which the king was elected by the hereditary nobility. This king would serve as the monarch until he died, at which time the country would have another election. This monarchy has been commonly referred to as a rzeczpospolita or republic, because of the high degree of influence wielded by the noble classes, often seen as a single non-homogenous class.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>outset</b> <b>of</b> the Second World War, {{due to the}} {{provisions}} of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, {{the decision was made to}} raise an all volunteer force, the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), to serve overseas—initial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly England—while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland from possible attack and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training.|$|E
