5|$|After a {{video call}} with Lydia, Alice {{inadvertently}} opens the video with the suicide instructions. With some difficulty, {{she finds the}} pills and is about <b>to</b> <b>swallow</b> them, but when she is interrupted {{by the arrival of}} her caregiver she drops the pills on the floor and forgets what she was doing.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{in several}} orders have keel-like {{extensions}} of the body-wall known as paranota, which can vary widely in shape, size, and texture; modifications include lobes, papillae, ridges, crests, spines and notches. Paranota may allow millipedes to wedge more securely into crevices, protect the legs, or make the millipede more difficult for predators <b>to</b> <b>swallow.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another common {{trick was}} <b>to</b> <b>swallow</b> 30 to 50 unshelled {{hazelnuts}} (although {{one of his}} posters advertised 40 pecans), followed by another nut of a different variety, such as an almond. Ali then brought them up one by one with the odd-nut-out produced at a mark called out by the audience. In another trick, Ali swallowed three to six handkerchiefs of different hues and then produced them in a color order requested by audience members.|$|E

5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them <b>to</b> <b>swallow</b> prey on land. Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E
5|$|Designed by {{visual effects}} artist Phil Tippett, Jabba the Hutt was {{inspired}} by the anatomy of several animal species. His body structure and reproductive processes were based on annelid worms, hairless animals that have no skeleton and are hermaphroditic. Jabba's head was modeled after that of a snake, complete with bulbous, slit-pupilled eyes and a mouth that opens wide enough <b>to</b> <b>swallow</b> large prey. His skin was given moist, amphibian qualities. Jabba's design would come to represent almost all members of the Hutt species in subsequent Star Wars fiction.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few days after hatching, young red-throated loons are fed aquatic insects and small {{crustaceans}} by both parents. After 3–4days, the parents switch to fish small enough for the young birds <b>to</b> <b>swallow</b> whole. By four weeks of age, the young can eat the same food—of the same size—as their parents do. Young birds may be fed for some time after fledging; adults have been seen feeding fish to juveniles at sea and on inland lakes in the United Kingdom, hundreds of kilometres from any breeding areas.|$|E

5|$|Some turbellarians have {{a simple}} pharynx lined with cilia and {{generally}} feed by using cilia to sweep food particles and small prey into their mouths, which are usually {{in the middle of}} their undersides. Most other turbellarians have a pharynx that is eversible (can be extended by being turned inside-out), and the mouths of different species can be anywhere along the underside. The freshwater species Microstomum caudatum can open its mouth almost as wide as its body is long, <b>to</b> <b>swallow</b> prey about as large as itself.|$|E
5|$|Yeah Yeah Yeahs' second album, Show Your Bones, was {{released}} in March 2006, followed a year later by another EP, Is Is. The band has also released one video album, Tell Me What Rockers <b>to</b> <b>Swallow,</b> which features footage from a live performance {{and all of the}} band's music videos through 2004. Yeah Yeah Yeahs released their third studio album, It's Blitz!, in April 2009.

5|$|After Dong Zhuo's defeat, Cao Cao {{focuses on}} uniting the land. He is {{surrounded}} by enemies: Dong Zhuo's general Lu Bu has taken over all of Dong Zhuo's troops and taken Xiapi Castle; Zhang Xiu has rebelled in Wan Castle; to the north, Yuan Shao threatened <b>to</b> <b>swallow</b> the north whole. Cao Cao defeated Zhang Xiu at Wan Castle, with his guard Dian Wei holding foes back in the burning castle. Cao Cao, having escaped, defeats Lu Bu in alliance with Liu Bei at Xiapi in 198 AD, exterminating his army and gaining several officers. Cao Cao's final victory is at the Battle of Guandu in 200 AD, where he destroys Yuan Shao's army before he even arrives.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Surface {{electromyography}} (sEMG) {{is being}} used with increasing frequency to identify the occurrence of <b>swallowing,</b> <b>to</b> describe <b>swallow</b> physiology, and <b>to</b> treat impaired <b>swallowing</b> function in dysphagic patients. Despite this increased utilization, limited information is available regarding the validity and reliability of investigators and clinicians to interpret sEMG data in reference <b>to</b> <b>swallowing.</b> This study examines the validity and interjudge reliability of swallow identification using sEMG records obtained from healthy adults. Validity and reliability estimates were compared between experienced and naı¨ve judges {{in the identification of}} swallows from graphic sEMG records. Multiple validity estimates were high, indicating a strong degree of accuracy in identification o...|$|R

5|$|As Alice's memory {{begins to}} fade, she daydreams {{of her mother}} and sister, who died in a car crash when she was a teenager. She memorizes words and sets a series of {{personal}} questions on her phone, which she answers every morning. She hides sleeping pills in her room, and records a video message instructing her future self <b>to</b> <b>swallow</b> the pills when she can no longer answer the questions. As her disease advances, she becomes unable to give focused lectures and loses her job. She becomes lost searching for the bathroom in her own home and does not recognize Lydia after seeing her perform in a play.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{mainly on}} bony fishes, the viper dogfish captures prey by {{protruding}} its jaws and impaling them with its teeth. Its impressive gape allows it <b>to</b> <b>swallow</b> relatively large fish whole. The skeletal and muscular structure {{of its head}} shows unique features that support this feeding mechanism, which is unlike that of other dogfish sharks. This shark gives birth to live young, which are nourished by yolk during gestation; the litter size is probably fewer than 26 pups. Small numbers of viper dogfish are caught incidentally in purse seines and bottom trawls. The IUCN presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of this species.|$|E
5|$|In Maine, on {{the other}} side of the Atlantic, {{shifting}} fish populations due to changes in sea temperature are being blamed for the lack of availability of the herring which is the staple diet of the puffins in the area. Some adult birds have become emaciated and died. Others have been provisioning the nest with butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) but these are often too large and deep-bodied for the chick <b>to</b> <b>swallow,</b> causing it to die from starvation. Maine is on the southerly edge of the bird's breeding range and with changing weather patterns, this may be set to contract northwards.|$|E
50|$|Abnormalities of the pharynx and/or {{oral cavity}} {{may lead to}} oropharyngeal dysphagia. Abnormalities of the {{esophagus}} may lead to esophageal dysphagia.The failure of the lower esophagous sphincter to respond properly <b>to</b> <b>swallowing</b> is called achalasia.|$|R

5|$|In {{the most}} celebrated episode of the Vita Sancti Paternus, King Arthur tries to steal St Padarn's tunic. King Arthur covets Padarn's tunic, and when he is refused, stamps the earth, at which Padarn calls on the earth <b>to</b> <b>swallow</b> him; it does so. Arthur has to beg {{forgiveness}} before he is released. This seems to borrow {{the story of a}} different Padarn, Padarn Redcoat, whose coat was one of the Thirteen Treasures of the Island of Britain (Tri Thlws ar Ddeg Ynys Prydain). This story takes place about a century before Saint Padarn; it is, however, important because of the link drawn between Saint Padarn and the Romano-British King Arthur, the legendary British leader of the late fifth and early sixth centuries.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the coup, Rainivoninahitriniony {{informed}} Lambert that {{he could}} not guarantee the support of the army and that the plot should be aborted. One of the officers believed the brothers had betrayed them and sought to exonerate himself by notifying the queen of the failed conspiracy. She reacted by expelling the foreigners from the island and subjecting all the implicated Merina officers to the tangena ordeal in which they were forced <b>to</b> <b>swallow</b> a poison to determine their guilt or innocence. Rainilaiarivony and his brother were excepted from this and remained, like her son Radama, in the queen's confidence for the few remaining years of her life.|$|E
5|$|Seldom observed, the {{frilled shark}} may capture prey by bending its body and lunging forward like a snake. The long, {{extremely}} flexible jaws enable it <b>to</b> <b>swallow</b> prey whole, while its many rows of small, needle-like teeth {{make it difficult}} for the prey to escape. It feeds mainly on cephalopods, leavened by bony fishes and other sharks. This species is aplacental viviparous: the embryos emerge from their egg capsules inside the mother's uterus, where they survive primarily on yolk. The gestation period may be as long as three and a half years, the longest of any vertebrate. Litter sizes vary from two to fifteen, and there is no distinct breeding season. Frilled sharks are occasional bycatch in commercial fisheries, but have little economic value.|$|E
50|$|Each palatoglossal arch runs downwards, {{laterally}} and forwards, {{from the}} soft palate {{to the side}} of the tongue. The approximation of the arches due to the contraction of the palatoglossal muscles constricts the isthmus, and is essential <b>to</b> <b>swallowing</b> (deglutition).|$|R
50|$|An adult {{mangrove}} snake {{can reach}} {{a length of}} 2.5 m. It is active at night (nocturnal) and hunts for birds, rats and birds eggs, its main diet. Its large head and mouth enables it <b>to</b> <b>swallows</b> its prey easily.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{condition}} involves alterations {{in the wall}} of the esophagus and reduction in the calibre of the esophagus, the symptoms of esophageal intramucosal pseudodiverticulosis are primarily related <b>to</b> <b>swallowing.</b> Difficulty swallowing solids is a typical symptom. In extreme cases, food may become impacted in the esophagus. [...] Some individuals may have bleeding in the esophagus, manifesting as vomiting of blood or as melena stools. With the reduction of oral intake due <b>to</b> difficulty <b>swallowing,</b> affected individuals usually lose weight.|$|R
5|$|The Eye's {{aggression}} {{may even}} extend to deities who, unlike Apep, are not regarded as evil. Evidence in early funerary texts suggests that at dawn, Ra was believed <b>to</b> <b>swallow</b> {{the multitude of}} other gods, who in this instance are equated with the stars, which vanish at sunrise and reappear at sunset. In doing so, he absorbs the gods' power, thereby renewing his own vitality, before spitting them out again at nightfall. The solar Eye is said to assist in this effort, slaughtering the gods for Ra to eat. The red light of dawn therefore signifies the blood produced by this slaughter.|$|E
5|$|Vanilla Ice took an {{interest}} in the musical style found on Hard <b>to</b> <b>Swallow</b> while performing {{as a member of a}} Miami grunge band, and was able to develop this sound through a friendship with producer Ross Robinson, with whom he shared {{an interest}} in motocross racing. Robinson produced the album after being advised against working with Vanilla Ice. The album's darker lyrical subject matter developed from conversations, in which Robinson encouraged him to write about his past. Subjects included Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood, drug addiction and struggles with fame. While the album revived Vanilla Ice's career, it received largely negative reviews and did not chart.|$|E
5|$|Weight {{loss and}} eating {{difficulties}} due to dysphagia and other muscle discoordination are common, making nutrition management increasingly {{important as the}} disease advances. Thickening agents {{can be added to}} liquids as thicker fluids are easier and safer <b>to</b> <b>swallow.</b> Reminding the affected person to eat slowly and to take smaller pieces of food into the mouth may also be of use to prevent choking. If eating becomes too hazardous or uncomfortable, the option of using a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is available. This is a feeding tube, permanently attached through the abdomen into the stomach, which reduces the risk of aspirating food and provides better nutritional management. Assessment and management by speech-language pathologists with experience in Huntington's disease is recommended.|$|E
