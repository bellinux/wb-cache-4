40|$|Numerous voice {{compression}} methods are available today for communications over low bandwidth channels. Worthy of note {{in particular are}} Linear Predictive Coding (LPC), Mixed Excitation LPC (MELP), and Code Excited LPC (CELP). The channel in these coding schemes is typically a digital transmission line or radio link, such as in cellular telephone communications, but may be other media such as files on a computer hard disk. Linear Predictive Coding is explored in some detail {{as a basis for}} creating a new speech synthesizer that does not convert text to speech (TTS), but rather uses a touch-screen Thin Film <b>Transistor</b> (TFT) <b>panel</b> as user input to create and control voice-like audio sound synthesis. Research has been carried out to conceptually try different methods for mapping TFT touch panel input (or any 2 -dimensional input) to LPC synthesis coefficient vectors for artificial speech reproduction. To achieve this, various LPC coefficient quantization algorithms have been explored and evaluated using Octave v. 3 scripts, resulting in selection and comparison in the final hardware and software implementation. The hardware and software development platform used for the final implementation is the Altium Nanoboard 3000 Xilinx Edition, along with the Altium Designer EDA package. The Nanoboard 3000 was chosen as it provided a convenient FPGA platform and all the necessary IP, IP Synthesis, and C compilers needed to prototype the design and perform further researc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel active touch panel circuit using the RC time {{constant}} changes when {{the panel is}} touched to induce pulse overlapping. The transient ON current of the pixel thin-film transistor (TFT) is to be detected for the judgment whether panel is touched or not. The proposed circuit has many advantages, such as simple structure, multi-touch, low operating power, as well as significant current to be read out easily by low cost ICs. Especially, it provides excellent stability since the circuit is hardly influenced by variation of TFTs. Discrete TFTs are used to build the proposed circuit to verify its function and the function is further demonstrated in a 2 -inch 9 9 array. The potential for large area applications is proven by simulating a 42 -inch touch panel with proper assumptions.

We have identified a new set of financial and non-financial performance indicators that can be used by high-tech manufacturing companies and have developed a business performance evaluation model. A data envelopment analysis (DEA), an analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and a fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making approach are used in the model. Data from large-sized thin-film <b>transistor</b> liquid-crystal display <b>panel</b> companies in Taiwan were collected via a field survey and from various published databases and were fed into the model to determine the relative business performance of the companies.

40|$|Manufacturers of the TFT-LCD (Thin-Film <b>Transistor</b> Liquid-Crystal Display) <b>panels</b> in Taiwan face {{challenges}} from increasing competition and falling prices. Additionally, these manufacturers are heavily reliant on {{the reliability of}} their supply chains, making the choice of upstream suppliers a mission-critical issue in the industry. This study employs Operating Costs, Research and Development (R&D) Expenses, Net Fixed Assets, and Total Assets as input parameters to output Operating Revenue and Quality System Audit (QSA) Scores for the TFT-LCD industry in Taiwan. Traditional DEA models {{are used in the}} confirmation analyses, whereas the Grey System entropy weight method is applied to calculate the relative weights of the various parameters. The weighting results are included in the DEA as constraint weights to be substituted into the CCR-AR, SBM-AR, and Additive-AR models. The results are then compared to evaluate efficiency in terms of satisfying practical application needs. Finally, a case study based on a large TFT-LCD company in Taiwan is analyzed to provide insight into variations in Decision Making Units (DMUs) caused by the use of various models. The results are valuable in terms of optimizing the selection of an appropriate model to carry out future studies.

40|$|After {{initial report}} of its {{potential}} use for flexible/large area electronics, amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O (a-IGZO) is now emerging worldwide as a new semiconductor for next gen-eration thin-film <b>transistor</b> (TFT) flat <b>panel</b> displays and imagers. This dissertation work examines in detail the basic properties and physics of the a-IGZO TFTs, including the photofield-effect, numerical simulations, electrical instability and noise characteristics. Our a-IGZO TFTs have following electrical performance: field-effect mobility (μeff) of 7 ~ 12. 3 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1, threshold voltage of 1 ~ 3 V, subthreshold swing of 130 ~ 420 mV/decade and on/off current ratio over 108. Aluminum and titanium are both suitable for source/drain (S/D) electrodes with the contact resistivity (rC) lower than 10 - 3 Ω-cm 2. The active layer thickness was also {{found to have a}} major impact on S/D series resistance. To accurately model the TFT current-voltage (I/V) properties, a gate-to-source voltage dependent μeff model is proposed. Light wavelength and intensity dependent photo-responses were studied. The a-IGZO TFT is stable under visible light illumination (460 ~ 660 nm). TFT off-state drain current starts to increase when the photon energy is higher than its band-gap (~ 3. 05 eV); and we observed a high UV-photocurrent conversion efficiency. In addition, the a-IGZO mid-gap density-of-states (DOS) was extracted and is more than an order of magnitude lower than the values of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). The DOS model for a-IGZO was then developed. In this model, the donor-like states are proposed to be associated with oxygen vacancy in a-IGZO. We showed through numerical simulation that the a-IGZO TFT has a very sharp conduction band-tail slope (Ea= 13 meV). The impacts of rC and DOS on TFT electrical properties were also studied. Bias-temperature-stress (BTS) induced electrical instability was investigated. Our re-sults suggest that the observed shifts in TFT I/V curves are primarily due to channel charge injection/trapping. The validity of using stretched-exponential model in simulating the time, voltage and temperature dependences of BTS data was demonstrated for a-IGZO TFTs. Finally, the TFT low frequency noise properties were examined. The 1 /f noise is the dominant source in a-IGZO TFT and can be modeled by Hooge mobility fluctuation theory. The a-IGZO has a lower Hooge’s parameter than a-Si:H and may be better used in imaging applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the digital information technology leads to amazingly increasing interesting {{for the development of}} the flat panel displays. In recent years, Thin Film <b>Transistor</b> (TFT) flat <b>panel</b> displays, based on the polycrystalline silicon thin film transistors, have been used in a large number of applications such as personal computers, mobile phones, digital cameras and digital projectors. In addition, in the next years it is expected to integrate all of the peripheral driver circuitry directly onto the glass substrate for reducing the displays cost and to find applications in threedimensional VLSI circuits. For such applications, main issues associated with TFTs are their reliability and stability. In the present thesis, polycrystalline silicon TFTs fabricated on fused quartz glasses have been studied. First, amorphous silicon (α-Si) thin films were deposited on quartz glass substrates by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). Then the amorphous films were crystallized by solid phase crystallization method (SPC) or by excimer laser annealing (ELA) or by the combination of the two methods. N- and p-channel self-aligned and offset-gated poly-Si TFTs, fabricated by SEIKO – EPSON using standard CMOS processes of microelectronics. The study of the transistors was performed in relation to the drain architecture, the quality of the polysilicon layer and the hydrogenation’s conditions. First, a simple method to determine the interface and bulk density of states in polycrystalline silicon thin-film transistors is presented. The energy distribution of the interface trap density has been extracted from analysis of the transfer characteristics in the subthreshold region of operation. Using the obtained interface state distribution, the energy distribution of the bulk traps has been determined by fitting the surface potential at each gate voltage with analytical theoretical model. Both interface and bulk traps were found to consist of deep states with constant density near the mid-gap and band-tails with density increasing exponentially with the energy when the trap energy approaches the conduction band-edge. In addition, to the above experimental techniques for characterization of the traps in TFTs, an improved analysis of the low frequency noise in polysilicon selfaligned TFTs is developed to determine the oxide trap density and to characterize the quality of the active polysilicon layer. The analysis is based on the Meyer – Neldel effect for the conductance and the flat-band voltage fluctuations for the origin of noise. From the analysis of the drain current spectral density, the density of the interface states and the slope of the exponential band tail states are determined. The slope of the exponential band tail is directly related to the quality and the degree of disorder of the polysilicon layer. ...|$|R
