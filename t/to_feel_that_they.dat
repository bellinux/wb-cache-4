5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E
25|$|Vehicles play an {{important}} role in the Halo games, and so vehicles were also given a long development stage. The UNSC's vehicles were designed by Marcus Lehto, Eric Arroyo, and Eddie Smith, and were designed to be functional and utilitarian. Their use of wheels also led many players <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were more fun to drive. The addition of the Mongoose ATV made headlines, after being cut from Halo 2. The original Warthog was considered a fan favorite.|$|E
25|$|Controlling abusers may use {{multiple}} {{tactics to}} exert {{power and control}} over their victims. The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive. Control may be helped through economic abuse thus limiting the victim's actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse. The goal of the abuser is to control and intimidate the victim or to influence them <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{do not have an}} equal voice in the relationship.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} morning, {{the courthouse}} {{was packed with}} townsfolk eager to hear if their reform petition would be heard. Much to their relief, Sullivan had decided to skip any case where either party was not ready <b>to</b> proceed. <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had achieved their goal, the rioters left the court to its business, and cheered General Sullivan for hearing their demands.|$|R
5000|$|The play {{expresses the}} pain in loss of war. When the late father Atsumori, {{describes}} his son, he talks about him with such joy. He uses simile to compare his son to a flower. He compares his son to an earthly object {{in order to allow}} audiences <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> privileged <b>that</b> <b>they</b> lived in a generation in which <b>they</b> could <b>feel</b> grateful <b>that</b> <b>they</b> weren't in war.|$|R
25|$|Shyness {{may involve}} the {{discomfort}} of difficulty in {{knowing what to}} say in social situations, or may include crippling physical manifestations of uneasiness. Shyness usually involves {{a combination of both}} symptoms, and may be quite devastating for the sufferer, in many cases leading them <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are boring, or exhibit bizarre behavior in an attempt to create interest, alienating them further. Behavioral traits in social situations such as smiling, easily producing suitable conversational topics, assuming a relaxed posture and making good eye contact, may not be second nature for a shy person. Such people might only affect such traits by great difficulty, or they may even be impossible to display.|$|E
500|$|Heelas {{added that}} within that broad demographic, the {{movement}} had nevertheless attracted a diverse clientele. He typified the typical New Ager {{as someone who}} was well-educated yet disenchanted with mainstream society, thus arguing that the movement catered to {{those who believe that}} modernity is in crisis. He suggested that the movement appealed to many former practitioners of the 1960s counter-culture because while they came <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were unable to change society, they were nonetheless interested in changing the self. He believed that many individuals had been [...] "culturally primed for what the New Age has to offer", with the New Age attracting [...] "expressive" [...] people who were already comfortable with the ideals and outlooks of the movement's self-spirituality focus. It could be particularly appealing because the New Age suited the needs of the individual, whereas traditional religious options that are available primarily catered for the needs of a community. He believed that although the adoption of New Age beliefs and practices by some fitted the model of religious conversion, others who adopted some of its practices could not easily be considered to have converted to the religion.|$|E
2500|$|A new benefit was envisaged {{that would}} 'accentuate the positive' rather than lead {{recipients}} with moderate disabilities <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were permanently incapacitated.

2500|$|The {{reasons behind}} the mutiny {{are still a}} subject of debate. Some sources report that Bligh was a cruel tyrant whose abuse of the crew led them <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{had no choice but}} to take over the ship. Other sources argue that Bligh was no worse (and, in many cases, objectively gentler) than the average captain of the era, and that the crew—inexperienced and unused to the rigours of the sea—were {{corrupted}} by the freedom, idleness and sexual licence of their 5 months in Tahiti, finding themselves unwilling to return to the [...] "Jack Tar's" [...] life of an ordinary seaman.|$|E
2500|$|For {{three generations}} the Eastern Chalukyan princes had married {{in to the}} Imperial Chola family and they came <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> belonged {{as much to the}} Chola family as to the Eastern Chalukyan. Further Rajendra Chalukya of Vengi, {{according}} to Kalingaltuparani, an epic written in praise of Kulothunga's invasion of Kalinga, [...] 'spent his childhood days in Gangaikonda Cholapuram and was a familiar favourite to the princes and the people of the Chola country'. It is under these circumstances, Rajendra Chalukya moved into the 'Political vacuum created by the death of Adhirajendra' and established himself on the Chola throne as Kulothunga Chola I. [...] Since then Kulottunga I and his descendants {{came to be known as}} the Chalukya-Cholas in history.|$|E
2500|$|The {{show was}} {{targeted}} to children, but attracted a sizable adult audience. Many episodes featured commercial tie-in merchandise, like toys and mail-order premiums, that were advertised during commercial breaks. Many {{of the ads}} for corporate sponsor Ralston Purina's Chex cereals used the show's space opera motif in their pitches. A unique feature of the TV and radio adventures was that the premium of the month was often worked into the story action. This permitted young viewers <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were participating in the radio or televised adventures. Space Patrols best known premium was a [...] "Name the Planet" [...] contest wherein the winner was awarded the program's Terra IV spaceship. [...] The prize was a giant trailer {{in the shape of}} the series' space craft. [...] One of the many [...] "Name the Planet" [...] commercials may be viewed online.|$|E

Before {{it could be}} released, a problem arose and the band had an important decision to make. Kyrre {{decided to leave the}} band to dedicate his time <b>to</b> his schooling. <b>Feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not continue without him, Beyond disbanded and Polyphonic was scrapped.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} aspect of self-destructive behavior is the inability to handle the stress stemming from an individual's lack of self-confidence - for example in a relationship, whether the other person is truly faithful ("how can they love someone like me?"); at work or school, whether the realization of assignments and deadlines is possible ("there is no way I can complete all my work on time"). Self-destructive people usually lack healthier coping mechanisms, like asserting personal boundaries. As a result, <b>they</b> tend <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> showing <b>they</b> are incompetent {{is the only way}} to untangle themselves from demands.|$|R

French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week.” ...|$|R
2500|$|The Wallflowers {{continued}} to tour {{through the first}} half of 1993 but despite this sales of the album were slow. In total, 40,000 copies were sold. Reviews for the album, however, were mostly positive. [...] Rolling Stone gave the album 4 stars calling it, [...] "one sweet debut" [...] and describing Dylan's songwriting as [...] "impressive." [...] Great reviews notwithstanding, executives at Virgin Records were reportedly not pleased with the album's lack of commercial success. [...] Around this time, the company was going through a shift in management which led to the removal of Jeff Ayeroff and Jordan Harris, the two people who initially brought the Wallflowers to Virgin. After Ayeroff and Harris left the company the Wallflowers began <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had no future with Virgin and asked to be released from their contract. [...] The split with Virgin has been regarded as mutual. By mid-1993 the Wallflowers were without a record label.|$|E
2500|$|From {{relatively}} {{early in}} his professional career, Lowell worried {{about the role of}} racial and ethnic minorities in American society. As early as 1887, he wrote of the Irish: [...] "What we need is not to dominate the Irish, but to absorb them.... We want them to become rich, and send their sons to our colleges, to share our prosperity and our sentiments. We do not want <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are among us and yet not really part of us." [...] He believed that only a homogeneous society could safeguard the achievements of American democracy. Sometime before 1906, he became an honorary vice-president of the Immigration Restriction League, an organization that promoted literacy tests and tightened enforcement of immigration laws. In 1910, he wrote approvingly in private of excluding Chinese immigrants entirely and of Southern states that denied the franchise to black citizens. Publicly he consistently adopted assimilation as the solution to absorbing other groups, limiting their numbers to levels he believed would allow American society to absorb them without being changed itself, a stance that [...] "fused liberal and racist ideas in making the case for exclusion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Social {{networking}} {{sites such}} as Facebook are occasionally used to emotionally abuse, harass or bully individuals, either by posting defamatory statements or by forwarding private digital photos or videos that can have an adverse impact on the individuals depicted in the videos. Such actions are {{often referred to as}} [...] "trolling". Confrontations in the real world can also be transferred to the online world. [...] Trolling can occur in many different forms, such as (but not limited to) defacement of deceased person(s) tribute pages, name-calling, playing online pranks on individuals and making controversial or inflammatory comments with the intention to cause anger and cause arguments. Individuals troll for many reasons. The psychology behind why people troll according to Psychology Today is due to anonymity, perceived obscurity, and a perceived lack of consequences for online misbehavior. Trolls may also do their activities due to a perceived majority status, social identity salience and due to a sense by the troll that she or he is surrounded by online 'friends'. Trolls may also engage in harmful acts due to desensitization or negative personality traits (Fox, 2014). As these eight reasons behind the thought processes of trolls suggest individuals thrive behind being able to create a false identity or pseudonym to hide behind and the premise that they have 'friends' on social networks that agree with their outlook on certain topics, thus join in on trolling. The idea behind the perceived lack of consequences is because they believe they have created an identity in which they can not be seen as a real life human and more of a persona/avatar that they have created, which leads them <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will not face the consequences of being an online troll.|$|E
50|$|Types of {{boundaries}} include physical, which is {{along the lines}} of not touching someone without permission being given; sexual boundaries; and emotional boundaries, which is avoiding the discussion of specific emotions. Boundaries help to set out rules for what is and is not acceptable {{to the members of the}} relationship. They also help people <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> safe and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are just as important in the open relationship as their partners.|$|R
5000|$|... {{alienation}}: Marx {{refers to}} the alienation of people from aspects of their [...] "human nature" [...] ("Gattungswesen", usually translated as 'species-essence' or 'species-being'). He believed that alienation is a systematic result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others {{and in so doing}} generate alienated labour. Alienation describes objective features of a person's situation in capitalism - it isn't necessary for them <b>to</b> believe or <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are alienated.|$|R
40|$|This study {{draws on}} {{attribution}} theory and literature from compensation and strategy to investigate executives’ perceptions about their {{influence over the}} firm’s stock price. We define stock price expectancy as the extent <b>to</b> which executives <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can influence the firm’s stock price. Results from of a survey of 435 U. S. executives suggest that stock price expectancy is related to both attributional and contextual antecedents. Based on these findings we discuss implications for the extension of expectancy theory and the design and administration of incentive systems...|$|R

5000|$|Attention {{has been}} drawn by Ofsted {{to the quality}} of the College's caring support and guidance: [...] "the {{appointment}} of specialist tutors has been successful in providing students with effective academic and personal support …. Students receive very effective tutorial support both through their regular meeting with one of the team of specialist tutors and through the high levels of less formal support they receive outside of lessons from their teachers. Students enjoy coming <b>to</b> college and <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are recognised and respected as individuals" [...] (Ofsted).|$|R
50|$|One {{antecedent}} to {{perceptions of}} organizational justice {{is the extent}} <b>to</b> which employees <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are involved in decision-making or other organizational procedures. Higher levels of justice are perceived when employees <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have input in processes than when employees do not perceive <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{have the opportunity to}} participate (Greenberg & Folger, 1983; Bies & Shapiro, 1988). The opportunity or ability to participate in decision making improves an individual's perceptions of procedural justice, even when the decision is unfavorable to the individual (Bies & Shapiro, 1988). In addition, other studies have shown that employee input is related to both procedural and interpersonal justice perceptions (Kernan & Hanges, 2002).|$|R
40|$|Aim: To explore women’s {{experiences}} {{of living with}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at home. Design: An explorative and descriptive qualitative design. Methods: A consecutive sample of nine women with COPD living at home. Data were collected in 2014 using semi-structured interviews and analysed using a qualitative content analysis. Results: Three main themes were identified: having a good life with COPD despite imitations; predictability and confidence in getting help; and the struggle to achieve a balance between insight and compliance with management of COPD. These women experienced limitations related to the traditional female role and felt unable to fulfil their own expectations.  They experienced a good life despite limitations arising from adaptation and coping strategies. <b>To</b> <b>feel</b> safe, <b>they</b> needed <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> confident <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would receive the necessary help in case of exacerbation of their disease. To enhance compliance with COPD management, the women wanted education that provided specific suggestions...|$|R

In their first meeting they wrote three songs, during a single day. Composing songs was the best way for them {{to get to know each}} other.

40|$|Abstract: Community re-studies can inform our {{understanding}} of what members of communities want from research and the extent <b>to</b> which <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> get it. The history of community research suggests that {{what is expected of}} researchers by community members can differ from what it is felt <b>that</b> <b>they</b> actually deliver, especially if the published reports have a critical edge. Challenges relating to this legacy of previous studies can be encountered by researchers returning to fi eldwork locations. Re-studies also provide opportunities to rectify matters, but these may be beyond the control of researchers who go back to communities studied previously...|$|R
