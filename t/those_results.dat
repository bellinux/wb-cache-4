25|$|Hypothesis testing acts as {{a filter}} of {{statistical}} conclusions; only <b>those</b> <b>results</b> meeting a probability threshold are publishable. Economics also {{acts as a}} publication filter; only <b>those</b> <b>results</b> favorable to the author and funding source may be submitted for publication. The impact of filtering on publication is termed publication bias. A related problem is that of multiple testing (sometimes linked to data mining), in which a variety of tests {{for a variety of}} possible effects are applied to a single data set and only those yielding a significant result are reported. These are often dealt with by using multiplicity correction procedures that control the family wise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery rate (FDR).|$|E
