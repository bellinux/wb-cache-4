25|$|The {{emphasis}} on the oral qualities of traditional story telling are also evident in this short story. The narrator is <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> his journey, and his anguish during his delirious night. This narration is full of voices, for example as don Chepe and Niña Tina respond to Cuero de Oro's exhortation. Asturias even ends the tale with the final sentence: and the conversation ended. The textual interplay between Cuero de Oro and don Chepe and Niña Tina can also be interpreted as representative {{of a child who}} is searching for the roots of his identity, questioning those who have access to this knowledge of another (mythical) time and space.|$|E
500|$|Dear {{later wrote}} that Persuasion was superficially [...] "a love {{story in the}} Cinderella mould" [...] {{but it was also}} one of [...] "realism and truthfulness", {{particularly}} in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited. He spent two years working on a script, and found this task difficult for several reasons. First, he needed to find a structure that would be faithful to the novel. Second, his protagonist barely spoke for the first half, and [...] "therefore can't motor the action along as a central character conventionally does". Adapting Austen's wit was another challenge; much could not be used [...] "because it's almost all in the author's voice <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> characters, with a certain wit or lightness that came from the characters themselves. It's a craft job, interpreting the novel for oneself and then finding a film language for it".|$|E
500|$|The writing staff {{often used}} their {{individual}} life experiences for inspirations {{to come up}} with the storylines of the series' episodes. For example, the episode [...] "Sailor Mouth", in which SpongeBob and Patrick learn profanity, was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience of getting in trouble as a child for using the f-word in front of his mother. Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life". The end of the episode, in which Mr. Krabs uses even more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself". The idea for the episode [...] "The Secret Box" [...] also came from one of Drymon's childhood experiences. Hillenburg explained, [...] "Drymon had a secret box [...] and started <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> it. We wanted to make fun of him and use it." ...|$|E

500|$|Episodes {{were written}} {{by a team of}} writers, which {{consisted}} of Dohrn, David Fain, Greenblatt, Mr. Lawrence, Lender, Mark O'Hare, Povenmire, William Reiss, Springer, Tibbitt, and Merriwether Williams. During the season, the writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for individual episodes. For example, in the episode [...] "Sailor Mouth", SpongeBob learns profanity. The idea for the episode was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience [...] " [...] I got in trouble for saying the f-word in front of my mother." [...] Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life." [...] The end of the episode, where Mr. Krabs uses more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was also inspired [...] "by the fact that my [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself." [...] In [...] "Secret Box", SpongeBob wants to see what is inside Patrick's secret box. The idea came to Drymon because he too had a secret box as a child. Creator Hillenburg said, [...] " [...] started <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> it. We wanted to make fun of him and use it." ...|$|E
2500|$|At daybreak on 8 February 1944, planes {{from the}} escort {{carriers}} were covering the convoy. At 13:00, the convoy changed course {{and started the}} last leg of the route toward the British Isles. At 19:30, fog set in and all ships were out of sight of LST-21 which turned on navigation lights and sounded whistle to avoid collision. At 8:45, the fog lifted and at 24:00 the convoy executed an emergency turn to starboard. On 9 February, at 00:35, the convoy resumed it course. At 01:13, they received a radio message that a submarine, , was sunk off the port side of the convoy. At 08:11, the convoy executed an emergency turn of 45 degrees to port, and at 08:40 resumed course. At 10:10, an escort on the starboard bow indicated a contact. LST-21s radioman tuned into an extra receiver on the escorts' and the planes' frequency and the officers and crew in LST-21s wheelhouse listened in on their communications. At approximately 11:00, a plane reported a sub on the surface bearing 150 degrees. The pilot kept repeating this to the Escort Commander, until the reply came back: [...] "Stop <b>telling</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> it and get the 'bowstud.'" [...] A few minutes later, the plane reported back: [...] "One down. One down." [...] At 12:14, all ships received a message from the convoy commander confirming the sinking of the second submarine. The weather was thick and visibility only about a mile and a half. At 16:45, they received another message from the Commodore confirming the sinking of a third submarine. The escorts and planes were noted to be having a difficult time with communications due to all of the contacts, real or imagined.|$|E
