5|$|Though {{the writing}} of vachana poems went into decline after {{the passing of the}} Basavanna era in the late 12th century, latter day vachanakaras such as Tontada Siddhesavara (or Siddhalinga Yati), a noted Shaiva saint and guru of King Virupaksha RayaII, started a revival. He wrote Shatsthala Jnanamrita (1540), a {{collection}} of 700 poems. In 1560, Virakta Tontadarya made the life of Tontada Siddhesavara the central theme in his writing Siddhesvara Purana. Virakta Tontadarya, Gummalapura Siddhalinga, Swatantra Siddhalingeshwara (1560) and Ghanalingideva (1560) are some well-known vachana poets who tried to recreate <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the early poets, though the socio-political expediency did not exist.|$|E
5|$|Having led Olimpia to the 1979 {{title as}} manager, Luis Cubilla {{returned}} to the club in 1988. With the legendary goalkeeper Ever Hugo Almeida, Gabriel González, Adriano Samaniego, and star Raul Vicente Amarilla, a rejuvenated decano boasted a formidable side that promised a return to <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the late 1970s. After coming up short in 1989 against Atlético Nacional, Olimpia reached the 1990 Copa Libertadores finals after defeating the defending champion in a climactic semifinal series decided on penalties. In the finals, Olimpia defeated Barcelona of Ecuador 3–1 in aggregate to win their second title. Olimpia reached the 1991 Copa Libertadores finals, once again, defeating Atlético Nacional in the semifinals and facing Colo-Colo of Chile in the final. Led by Yugoslavian coach Mirko Jozić, the Chilean squad beat the defending champion 3–0. The defeat brought Olimpia's second golden era to a close.|$|E

25|$|Two of {{the islands}} had been in Danish {{possession}} since the 17th century and St. Croix since 1733. <b>The</b> <b>glory</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the colony had been from around 1750 to 1850 based on transit trade {{and the production of}} rum and sugar using African slaves as labor. By {{the second half of the}} 19th century the sugar production was embattled by the cultivation of sugar beets, and although the slaves had been emancipated in 1848, the agricultural land and the trade was still controlled by the white population, and the living conditions of the descendants of the slaves were poor.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>glory</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the Cowboys {{were again}} {{beginning}} to dim as free agency, age, and injuries began taking their toll.

They finished the regular season with a 10–6 record, won the NFC East title, and entered the playoffs as the number 3 seed in the NFC.

25|$|Collingwood {{continues}} to be financially viable through the loyal support of its huge following and numerous sponsors. After finishing 2nd in 2002 and 2003 the team fell to 13th and 15th (out of 16) in 2004 and 2005 respectively. This trend has plagued the club since <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> pre-World War II VFL football. Since 1958, the club has won only two VFL/AFL Premiership (the inaugural AFL Premiership in 1990, and in 2010). Despite this, the club still has won more individual games, more finals and made more grand final appearances than any other club.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>glory</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the Philippine coffee {{industry}} lasted until 1889 when coffee rust hit the Philippine shores. That, {{coupled with an}} insect infestation, destroyed virtually all the coffee trees in Batangas. Since Batangas was a major producer of coffee, this greatly affected national coffee production. In two years, coffee production was reduced to 1/6th its original amount. By then, Brazil had regained its position as the world's leading producer of coffee. A few of the surviving coffee seedlings were transferred from Batangas to Cavite, where they flourished. This was {{not the end of}} the Philippines' coffee growing days, but there was less area allotted to coffee because many farmers had shifted to other crops.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} new 750cc and 900cc triple-cylinder bikes and 1000cc and 1200cc four-cylinder bikes were {{launched}} at the September 1990 Cologne Motorcycle Show. The motorcycles used famous model names from <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Meriden Triumph and were first {{made available to}} the public between March (Trophy 1200 being the first) and September 1991. All used a modular liquid-cooled DOHC engine design in a common large diameter steel backbone frame. The modular design was to ensure that a variety of models could be offered whilst keeping production costs under control—an idea originally put forward, in air-cooled form, in the early 1970s by Bert Hopwood but not implemented by the then BSA-Triumph company.|$|E

50|$|Rather, Bandula's {{continued}} {{popularity is}} because of his courage to fight on against an overwhelmingly superior enemy. Perhaps, it is also because the Burmese view Bandula as the proxy for <b>the</b> last <b>glory</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Third Burmese Empire. The Burmese remember that Bandula's death {{was followed by a}} series of one ignominious setback after another that eventually led to the loss of sovereignty in 1885. Indeed, some would say the ignominious setbacks continue up to this day. For whatever reason, Maha Bandula remains the most famous general in Burmese history.|$|R
5000|$|Andrew Pulver {{described}} Suschtizky in 2007 as [...] "a living link to <b>the</b> prewar <b>glory</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British documentary movement."

25|$|In 1970, he {{made another}} TV special: Gene Kelly and 50 Girls and {{was invited to}} bring the show to Las Vegas, Nevada—which he did for an eight-week stint on the {{condition}} he be paid more than any artist had ever been paid there. He directed veteran actors James Stewart and Henry Fonda in the comedy western The Cheyenne Social Club (1970) which performed poorly at the box-office. In 1973, he worked again with Frank Sinatra as part of Sinatra's Emmy nominated TV special, Magnavox Presents Frank Sinatra. Then, in 1974, he appeared as one of many special narrators in the surprise hit of the year That's Entertainment!. He subsequently directed and co-starred with his friend Fred Astaire in the sequel That's Entertainment, Part II (1976). It was a measure of his powers of persuasion that he managed to coax the 77-year-old Astaire – who had insisted that his contract rule out any dancing, having long since retired—into performing a series of song and dance duets, evoking a powerful nostalgia for <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the American musical film.|$|E
25|$|Controversy was {{prompted}} in 1987 {{with the arrival}} of Cindy Parker (Ellen Wheeler), who would later fall in love with Stuart. The character was revealed to have AIDS. Through visits by now-Dr. Angie Hubbard, the show educated the public on how the disease was spread and how to prevent it. Cindy had contracted HIV from her husband, Fred, played by Mark Morrison who contracted it from sharing needles for drug use. Cindy is attacked by a vigilante hate group led by her niece, Skye Chandler. The tragedy of the attack shows the extremes of violence that occur every day to victims of the disease. Cindy marries Stuart and he adopts her son, Scott. She dies early in 1989 in one of the show's most watched episodes. ABC wanted changes at All My Children. The show was getting about 6.5 million viewers per episode, but there sentiment that the program had lost its unique sense of humor and was simply copying other soaps with action/adventure storylines. Efforts were made to bring the show back to <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, WWE {{produced}} a DVD called The Monday Night Wars. Two hours in length, the DVD left {{out a large}} portion of the wars, breaking off around 1997 before jumping straight to the post-WCW era of WWE. The objectivity of the DVD's content was questioned, as some believed the documentary was simply telling the WWE side of the story. On August 25, 2009, WWE released The Rise and Fall of WCW on DVD. The DVD looked back at the roots of WCW during the days of GCW and Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, to <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Monday Nitro and the nWo, and to its demise and sale to WWE. This DVD included several new interviews from Vince McMahon, Jim Crockett, Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Bill Goldberg, as well as many of those responsible for running the NWA and WCW. Archive interviews were included from former WCW talent such as Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff, due to their respective contracts with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling not allowing them to provide fresh interviews for WWE. In 2014, WWE Network released a new documentary series, The Monday Night War: WWE vs. WCW, covering a much broader scope of the wars than the previous Monday Night Wars DVD, as well as providing more equal viewpoints for both WWE and WCW.|$|E

50|$|Subotić, {{one of the}} team's 3 {{key players}} from the 1987-1992 era, took over as head coach, and {{produced}} some satisfactory results, but Aris still displayed {{a lot of the}} disadvantages of a newly formed team. Aris, though, had a spectacular run to the Korać Cup title, Beşiktaş of the Turkish League, Beobanka of the Yugoslavian League, Peristeri of the Greek League, and Benetton Treviso of the Italian League, were all eliminated by Aris during the competition, in dramatic fashion, with the overtime return leg game in Italy reminding many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old <b>glory</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Aris in Europe.|$|R

25|$|Like the Fair Folk, the Dragon Kings are not Exalted; {{they are}} supernatural creatures {{offered as a}} player {{character}} type. The Dragon Kings are large dinosaur-like beings of great power. Dragon Kings are sworn in allegiance to the Unconquered Sun, their creator. According to the fictional history of Exalted, before {{the time of the}} Exalted, the Dragon Kings ruled Creation and the mortals who dwelt there, but the majority of their perpetually-reincarnating souls were annihilated during the war against the Primordials, putting an end to their ascendance over Creation. The Unconquered Sun used them as powerful servants to his chosen whom they served faithfully, honoring their Exalted brethren. After the First Age ended in war and disease, what remained of their civilization collapsed, and most Dragon Kings today never outgrow the feral 'stalker' mindset they are born into. They still exist in the Second Age, though the once great Dragon Kings remain hidden in the farthest corners of Creation. The majority of the remaining Dragon Kings are in Rathess, an ancient home filled with a variety of powerful artifacts made by the Dragon Kings in <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> the First Age. The developers describe four types of Dragon Kings, each living in a quadrant of Creation; the graceful flying Pterok (North), the nimble and lithe Raptok (East), the powerful and loyal Anklok (South), and the clever amphibious Mosok (West). Rules for playing Dragon Kings are presented in the Exalted Player's Guide in 1st edition and the Scroll of the Fallen Races in 2nd edition.|$|E

He was replaced by Archduke Eugen of Austria, who the Austro-Hungarians hoped would [...] "restore Habsburg forces to <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> Prince Eugene". Von Frank was dismissed as commander of the 5th Army and replaced by Karl Tersztyánszky von Nádas, who had commanded the 4th Corps at the Battle of Cer. The 5th and 6th armies were then merged into a single 5th Army consisting of 95,000 men.|$|E
40|$|The Thai {{economy has}} {{performed}} extremely well in recent years.
