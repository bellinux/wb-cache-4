2500|$|Benzodiazepine use {{for more}} than one to six months at {{prescribed}} doses is associated with an increased risk of the development of ovarian cancer. Fifteen epidemiologic studies have shown hypnotic drug use is associated with increased mortality, mainly due to increased cancer deaths in humans. These were cancers of the brain, lung, bowel, breast, and bladder, and other neoplasms. Not only are benzodiazepines associated with an increased risk of cancer, but the benzodiazepine receptor agonist Z-drugs also are associated with cancer in humans in these studies. Initially, FDA reviewers did not want to approve the Z-drugs due to concerns of cancer, but ultimately changed their minds and approved the drugs despite the concerns. <b>The</b> <b>data</b> <b>show</b> the trial subjects receiving hypnotic drugs had an increased risk of developing cancer. The review author concluded, [...] "the likelihood of cancer causation is sufficiently strong now that physicians and patients should be warned that hypnotics possibly place patients at higher risk for cancer." ...|$|E
