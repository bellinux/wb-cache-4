Students in these classes are children of repatriate, refugee or immigrant families mostly from the former USSR and Albania who have settled in Greece in the last fifteen years. The policy for language minority children is informed by a deficit model. In official terms, these children lack the necessary proficiency in the Greek language 8 ̆ 5 so evidently they must acquire {{from the very first}} weeks of their attendance in the Greek school readiness for linguistic communication in their new environment. 1 Consequently, the main function of reception classes is to develop the childrens second language proficiency alone, since proficiency in the school language is considered a necessary but also sufficient condition for the childrens academic performance.

The spectrum contains at least 14 independent C IV absorption systems longward of the Lyα forest. These systems are found over a path length of ∆z = 0. 984, constituting {{one of the}} highest densities per unit redshift of C IV absorption ever observed. One of the C IV systems is trough-like and resembles a weak BAL-type outflow. Two of the C IV are “associated” absorption systems with |v | 3000 kms − 1, eight are either resolved or require multiple discrete systems to fit the line profiles. In addition to C IV absorption, there are two low-ionization Mg II absorption systems along with two damped Lyα systems, at least one of which may be a C IV system. The overdensity of C IV absorption spans a redshift range of ∆z ∼ 1. Superclusters along the line of sight are unlikely to cause an overdensity stretching over such a long redshift path, thus the absorption may be an example of narrow, high-velocity, intrinsic absorption that originates from the quasar.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of transition classes in lowering the need for remedial services and special education, and in allowing developmentally young students to achieve academic success in line with their development. ^ A school district in a suburban, middle class town in central Connecticut was studied. The district 2 ̆ 7 s transition classes followed a developmental philosophy with an integrated program that supported growth and achievement through a variety of child-centered, experience-based activities. Children placed in a transition class between kindergarten and grade one for the period 1979 to 1983 participated. Their academic achievement and need for services were compared longitudinally with their age and grade peers through grade five. To determine achievement and identification for Chapter I services, records of 387 students (102 transition and 285 non-transition) were compared using standardized scores on the Reading and Total Math subtests of the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) (Hieronymus 2 ̆ 6 Lindquist, 1978) administered at grades three and five. To determine whether <b>transitional</b> <b>classes</b> were effective in limiting later identification for remedial and special education, the same groups 2 ̆ 7 referrals for the remedial and special education services from 1979 to 1988 were reviewed. ^ Separate 2 (group) x 3 (year) x 2 (test grade) analyses of variance (ANOVA 2 ̆ 7 s) for Reading and Total Math ITBS scores showed no differences between the transition students and their grade peers. Similar 2 (group) x 2 (year) x 2 (test grade) ANOVA 2 ̆ 7 s for the same measures did not yield differences between the transition students and their age peers. Chi-square tests of the total numbers of transition and non-transition students identified for special education and Chapter I services again did not detect differences. The overall pattern of results suggests that transition class placement may have had some effect with this sample in providing students with a developmentally appropriate program that allowed them to achieve on a level with their grade peers and limited their later identification for remedial and special education services. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{mechanical}} design {{as well as}} protection from various natural hazards, one must ensure an extremely low failure probability such as 10 − 6. How to achieve that goal is adequately understood only for the limiting cases of brittle or ductile structures. Here we present a theory {{to do that for}} the <b>transitional</b> <b>class</b> of quasibrittle structures, having brittle constituents and characterized by nonnegligible size of material inhomogeneities. We show that the probability distribution of strength of the representative volume element of material is governed by the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of atomic energies and the stress dependence of activation energy barriers; that it is statistically modeled by a hierarchy of series and parallel couplings; and that it consists of a broad Gaussian core having a grafted far-left power-law tail with zero threshold and amplitude depending on temperature and load duration. With increasing structure size, the Gaussian core shrinks and Weibull tail expands according to the weakest-link model for a finite chain of representative volume elements. The model captures experimentally observed deviations of the strength distribution from Weibull distribution and of the mean strength scaling law from a power law. These deviations can be exploited for verification and calibration. The proposed theory will increase the safety of concrete structures, composite parts of aircraft or ships, microelectronic components, microelectromechanical systems, prosthetic devices, etc. It also will improve protection against hazards such as landslides, avalanches, ice breaks, and rock or soil failures...|$|E

It is advertised that Tromsø has a mild coastal climate compared to other destinations at similar latitudes. Existing snow climate classes separate covers into a maritime, continental and a <b>transitional</b> <b>class</b> where persistent weak layers are rare in the maritime class. Rain and average air temperatures during snow season are decisive factors whether a snow pack one single winter is classified as maritime or not (Mock & Birkeland, 2000). In total 76 snow profiles from the winter 2016 - 2017, in addition to winter meteorological data from 1957 to 2017, {{have been used to}} classify the snow cover climate in the Tromsø area. During the winter season 2016 – 2017, two study plots approximately 25 and 50 km away from open sea were classified as maritime and continental, respectively. Simultaneously, persistent weak layers were observed and forecasted from February to mid-May in both forecasting regions Lyngen and Tromsø. Thus, an Arctic transitional snow climate is defined as having multiple rain-induced crusts in relatively warmer years and extensive depth hoar formation in relatively colder years, where the frequency of constructive metamorphism increase inland. Such a snow cover classification is useful in many ways. Spatial comparison with other areas, both national and international, becomes possible; temporal comparison, making a description of the relation- ship between weak layers and climate, becomes possible; as well as it provides a better data set for Norwegian avalanche forecasters. Also, this thesis provides the Tromsø area with its own snow cover climate describing typical processes influencing snow and snow stability. At best, the knowledge provided may contribute to prevent fatal accidents in snow covered avalanche terrain...|$|E
40|$|We {{identify}} {{a population of}} morphologically defined E/S 0 galaxies lying on the blue sequence at the present epoch. Using three samples, we analyze blue-sequence E/S 0 s with stellar masses > 10 ^ 8 Msun, arguing that individual objects may be evolving either up toward the red sequence or down into the blue sequence. Blue-sequence E/S 0 galaxies become more common with decreasing stellar mass, comprising 5 % near the "bimodality mass" M_b ~ 3 x 10 ^ 10 Msun, and sharply rising to > 20 - 30 % below the "threshold mass" M_t ~ 4 - 6 x 10 ^ 9 Msun. The strong emergence of blue-sequence E/S 0 s below M_t coincides with a previously reported global increase in mean atomic gas fractions below M_t for galaxies of all types on both sequences, suggesting that the availability of cold gas may be basic to blue-sequence E/S 0 s' existence. Environmental analysis reveals that many sub-M_b blue-sequence E/S 0 s reside in low to intermediate density environments. In mass-radius and mass-sigma scaling relations, blue-sequence E/S 0 s are more similar to red-sequence E/S 0 s than to late-type galaxies, but they represent a <b>transitional</b> <b>class.</b> While some of them, especially in the high-mass range from M_b to M_s, resemble major-merger remnants that will likely fade onto the red sequence, most blue-sequence E/S 0 s below M_b show signs of disk and/or pseudobulge building, which may be enhanced by companion interactions. We argue that sub-M_b blue-sequence E/S 0 s occupy a "sweet spot" in stellar mass and concentration, with both abundant gas and optimally efficient star formation, which may enable the formation of large spiral disks.

After Slovenia gained its independence in 1991, two parallel processes could be observed. On the one hand, the state itself was searching for a new identity which it could project both inward and outward, it was {{looking for a way to}} communicate the national tale of itself through numerous ruling discourses of politics, economy, tourism, sports and culture. On the other hand, the <b>transitional</b> ruling <b>class</b> and the emergent social force of postsocialist rich, chosen and owners needed new elements in the process of social differentiation. Fashion became one of the reinvented refuges or simply “discoveries” of the new Slovenian political, economic and media elite, which used the media to establish a visual order of transitional social differentiation. At the core of fashion as a mode of social distinction is a ceremonialized and spectacularized display of cultural differences within a society. Elites have been caught in the social obligation of constant invention of novelty, in order to create the necessary social difference from the non-elite or the masses. Namely, difference itself has no wider social value if there is no one to notice or desire it. This article methodologically authenticates the conclusions through the analysis of specific media perceptions and an ethnography conducted among actors on these levels: producers of fashion as social distinction (the elite) vs reproducers of fashion as social distinction (the media) vs consumers of fashion as social distinction (the audience) ...|$|R

Furthermore, these kindergarten students demonstrated the ability to infer the meaning of English cognate words that they had been taught only in Spanish. Findings from this study align with evidence in psycholinguistic studies showing a cognate facilitation effect in L 2 word learning that makes cognates easier to learn and remember than non-cognate translations, and finds this evidence in an applied classroom setting.

Fish from the west coast were collected in April and May 1984, those from the south coast during November 1983 and 1984. Diet was determined from stomach contents. Dry mass and numbers of food items are presented. Copepods were the principal food off the south coast, constituting a mean of 67 % (range: 60 - 75 %) by mass of gut contents in juveniles, a mean of 59 % (range 44 - 88 %) in the <b>transitional</b> juvenile/adult size <b>class</b> and a mean of 43 % (range: 30 - 73 %) by mass in the adults. Adult and larval stages of euphausiids were also an important dietary component of these fish, comprising a mean of 10 % (range: 0 - 18 %) by mass in the juveniles, a mean of 14 % (range: 7 - 18 %) in the <b>transitional</b> juvenile/adult size <b>class</b> and a mean of 52 % (range: 27 - 63 %) by mass in the adults. On the west coast chaetognaths {{appeared to be the}} principal food item of the juvenile fish examined, yielding values as high as 99 % by mass. Other less important prey in both areas included cladocerans, ostracods, fish eggs, pteropods, bivalve larvae, squid and juvenile fish. Phytoplankton formed a negligible component of the diet. It was present in minute quantities in the west coast fish only. Diurnal feeding patterns were investigated for both areas. Total mass of stomach contents constituted a maximum of 1. 2 % of total fish mass off the south coast in November 1983, and a maximum of 0. 85 % in November 1984. Off the west coast, where juveniles only were sampled, the stomach content mass made up to 7 % of body mass. Stomachs were fullest in the afternoon and early evening and it is inferred that feeding takes place during daylight hours. Predator-prey size relationships were investigated using two methods. The first method involved testing the correlation between fish mass and prey mass and the second employed Ursin's procedure using predator-prey mass ratios.

ALTO addresses {{a wide array of}} phonological, inflectional and lexical issues in Tseltal. In this study, we analyze rearticulated vowels (VhV, V'V), elicited from two speakers in each of the seventeen areas which make up the dialectal network where Tseltal is currently spoken. Beyond the dialectal areas that seem prevalent on the linguistic evolution of rearticulated vowels, the main classes of realizations of these complex nuclei are described according to a scale of neutralization ranging from the rearticulation to the simplification of the complex syllable nuclei. These classes of phenomena highlight (in terms of structural complexity and areal distribution) the structural properties of the s. c. rearticulated or interrupted vowels, particularly marked in languages across the world. Acoustic measures of the duration, harmonic-to-noise ratio, spectral center of gravity, fundamental frequency (F 0) and formants (F 1 -F 3) are detailed according to cardinal levels of vowel aperture (low versus high). The results show that rearticulated vowels tend to be extra-long, that the hiatus slot is not characterized by any specific place of articulation, and that rearticulation does not involve any modification of formants nor F 0 patterns on nuclei. The results also show that asymmetric properties may be found between low and high rearticulated vowels, as well as between degrees of neutralization for both subclasses of complex nuclei (VhV versus V'V). The authors conclude that rearticulated vowels have generic properties that make them closer to long vowels than to 'tautosyllabic hiatus'. However, this categorization still has to be further investigated insofar as rearticulated vowels, according to the dialectal varieties and speakers' interpretation of phonological patterns in complex nuclei, tend to be realized either as a hiatus with glide insertion, a vowel chain with inner onset, or as simple long or short vowels. They turn out to qualify less properly as interrupted or rearticulated vowels than as a <b>transitional</b> <b>class</b> between long vowels and hiatus...|$|E
40|$|The {{observation}} that the hydrogen isotope composition (δD) of leaf wax lipids is determined mainly by precipitation δD values, {{has resulted in the}} application of these biomarkers to reconstruct paleoclimate from geological records. However, because the δD values of leaf wax lipids are additionally affected by vegetation type and ecosystem evapotranspiration, paleoclimatic reconstruction remains at best semi-quantitative. Here, we used published results for the carbon isotope composition (δ 13 C) of n-alkanes in common plants along a latitudinal gradient in C 3 /C 4 vegetation and relative humidity in Cameroon and demonstrated that pentacyclic triterpene methyl ethers (PTMEs) and n-C 29 and n-C 31 in the same soil, derived mainly from C 4 graminoids (e. g. grass) and C 3 plants (e. g. trees and shrubs), respectively. We found that the δD values of soil n-C 27, n-C 29 and n-C 31, and PTMEs correlated significantly with surface water δD values, supporting previous observations that leaf wax lipid δD values are an effective proxy for reconstructing precipitation δD values even if plant types changed significantly. The apparent fractionation (εapp) between leaf wax lipid and precipitation δD values remained relatively constant for C 3 -derived long chain n-alkanes, whereas εapp of C 4 -derived PTMEs decreased by 20 ‰ along the latitudinal gradient encompassing a relative humidity range from 80 % to 45 %. Our results indicate that PTME δD values derived from C 4 graminoids may be a more reliable paleo-ecohydrological proxy for ecosystem evapotranspiration within tropical and sub-tropical Africa than n-alkane δD values, the latter being a better proxy for surface water δD values. We suggest that vegetation changes associated with different plant water sources and/or difference in timing of leaf wax synthesis between C 3 trees of the <b>transitional</b> <b>class</b> and C 3 shrubs of the savanna resulted in a D depletion in soil long chain n-alkanes, thereby counteracting the effect of evapotranspiration D enrichment along the gradient. In contrast, evaporative D enrichment of leaf and soil water was significant enough to be recorded in the δD values of PTMEs derived from C 4 graminoids, likely because PTMEs recorded the hydrogen isotopic composition of the same vegetation type...|$|E

All fingerprints are stored in NIST's IHead raster data format and compressed using a non-standard implementation of the JPEG lossless [1] compression algorithm. The prints are 832 (w) X 768 (h) pixels (see Appendix A). Image data stored on the first CD-ROM requires approximately 690 megabytes of storage. The second and third CD-ROMs require approximately 590 megabytes of storage. The average compression ratio for all the images is 1. 9 : 1. The data was collected by selecting non-mated fingerprint cards, from the FBI's Technical Master File, which contained the most occurrences of the desired fingerprint patterns. Since the entire card was digitized, there is a mix of other classes within the specific class groupings. The data also includes a significant number of referenced fingerprints.

Finally, students would present the case for their side, and groups from the other side would get a chance to counter the point.

For this reason, these disks are extremely important for the study of planetary system formation. Aims. The Herschel Space Observatory provides an unique opportunity for studying the outer regions of protoplanetary disks. In this work we update previous knowledge on the transitional disks in the Chamaeleon I and II regions with data from the Herschel Gould Belt Survey. Methods. We propose a new method for transitional disk classification based on the WISE 12 [*]μm − PACS 70 [*]μm color, together with inspection of the Herschel images. We applied this method to the population of Class II sources in the Chamaeleon region and studied the spectral energy distributions of the transitional disks in the sample. We also built the median spectral energy distribution of Class II objects in these regions for comparison with transitional disks. Results. The proposed method allows a clear separation of the known transitional disks from the Class II sources. We find six transitional disks, all previously known, and identify five objects previously thought to be transitional as possibly non-transitional. We find higher fluxes at the PACS wavelengths in the sample of transitional disks than those of Class II objects. Conclusions. We show the Herschel 70 [*]μm band to be a robust and efficient tool for transitional disk identification. The sensitivity and spatial resolution of Herschel reveals a significant contamination level among the previously identified transitional disk candidates for the two regions, which calls for a revision of previous samples of transitional disks in other regions.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the enduring critical neglect of seventeenth-century Scottish romance. In {{order to do}} so, it analyses four texts, namely Patrick Gordon’s Penardo and Laissa (1615), Patrick Hannay’s Sheretine and Mariana (1622), John Kennedy’s Calanthrop and Lucilla (1626) and George Mackenzie’s Aretina; or, the Serious Romance (1661). This study will evidence how Scottish romance pits itself against conventional motifs of the genre, indeed against its own more popular romantic features, and that it arguably instances a male resistance ─ prompted by a particularly Christian bias against sublimating love ─ against what was {{perceived to be the}} dangerously ‘feminised’ context of romance. It will indicate how Scottish romance thus sits apart from its contemporary equivalents with their more amatory accents, and how it is instead a canon of disparities, rather than of uniformity. Over and above this, the present study shall address the deliberate use of the genre’s inherently idiosyncratic nature to articulate cultural, literary and political aspects {{of what it means to}} be a Scottish seventeenth-century work of fiction, <b>transitional</b> between nations, <b>classes</b> and cultural periods, between local and British politico-cultural paradigms, essences and discontinuities. This study thus foregrounds the deliberate polyvalence of these texts, and identifies those particular aspects of seventeenth-century socio-political history that have rendered these texts so disparate not just from one another, but from the British and Continental romance tradition more generally. It will indicate how a significant shift of address to an implied audience ─ royal to noble ─ as well as the pursuit of appropriate patronage was of particular import for Scottish romancers, for whom the turbulent cultural shifts of the early seventeenth century symptomised in their respective texts a striking level of disunity, fracture, and a series of perplexing multiples...|$|R

The sensitivity and spatial resolution of Herschel reveals a significant contamination level among the previously identified transitional disk candidates for the two regions, which calls for a revision of previous samples of transitional disks in other regions. The systematic excess found at the PACS bands could be a result of the mechanism that produces the transitional phase, or an indication of different evolutionary paths for <b>transitional</b> disks and <b>Class</b> II sources.
