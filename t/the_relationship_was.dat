5|$|After the Nazis {{seized power}} {{the family moved}} first to Möhlstrasse in Munich, and in 1934 to Lake Tegern, where they bought a house. Himmler also later {{obtained}} a large house in the Berlin suburb of Dahlem, free of charge, as an official residence. The couple saw little of each other as Himmler became totally absorbed by work. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> strained. The couple did unite for social functions; they were frequent guests at the Heydrich home. Margarete saw it as her duty to invite the wives of the senior SS leaders over for afternoon coffee and tea on Wednesday afternoons.|$|E
5|$|Around 1898 Holden began {{living with}} Margaret Steadman (née Macdonald, 1865–1954), {{a nurse and}} midwife.

Steadman had separated from her husband James Steadman, a university tutor, because of his alcoholism and abuse.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> can <b>be</b> {{analyzed}} through techniques {{developed for}} the analysis of interpersonal ties.

5|$|Eleanor and her {{daughter}} Anna became estranged after she took over some of her mother's social duties at the White House. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> further strained because Eleanor desperately wanted {{to go with her}} husband to Yalta in February 1945 (two months before FDR's death), but he took Anna instead. A few years later, the two were able to reconcile and cooperate on numerous projects. Anna took care of her mother when she was terminally ill in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{on arrival}} in Port Jackson Baker {{also took a}} common-law wife from among the convicts – 25-year-old Susannah Huffnell, who had been sentenced to seven years {{transportation}} for petty larceny. Their only child, Elizabeth, was born on 1 January 1789. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> not a happy one and Baker refused to accompany {{his wife and child}} when they were transferred to the remote colonial outpost of Norfolk Island in March 1790. Susannah and Elizabeth had no further contact with Baker, even after they returned to Sydney in the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{the role}} of Metrovías was lessened to simply {{operating}} the lines, while maintenance of infrastructure became the responsibility of SBASE. The relationship between Mauricio Macri's mayoral administration and Metrovías became increasingly strained, with the Government of Buenos Aires issuing multiple fines to the operator. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> further strained in 2013 when Metrovías' 20-year concession ended and has since been renewed on a year-by-year basis, leaving {{the door open for}} a state-run or mixed operation.

5|$|In mid-1922, Speer began courting Margarete (Margret) Weber (1905–1987), the {{daughter}} of a successful craftsman who employed 50 workers. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> frowned upon by Speer's class-conscious mother, who felt that the Webers were socially inferior.

5|$|Russell {{was married}} to his college {{sweetheart}} Rose Swisher from 1956 to 1973. They had three children, namely daughter Karen Russell, the television pundit and lawyer, and sons William Jr. and Jacob. However, the couple grew emotionally distant and divorced. In 1977, he married Dorothy Anstett, Miss USA of 1968, but they divorced in 1980. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> shrouded in controversy because Anstett was white. In 1996, Russell married his third wife, Marilyn Nault; their marriage lasted until her death in January 2009. He has been a resident of Mercer Island, Washington for over four decades.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> often tense {{between the}} City and the Crown.

The City magistrates were of the generation that had fought in the Civil War, and could remember how Charles I's grab for absolute power had led to that national trauma.|$|E

5|$|After being {{assigned}} to cover Roosevelt during her husband's first presidential campaign, Hickok {{struck up a}} close relationship with the soon-to-be First Lady. For several years, the two corresponded almost every day, traveled together, and professed emotional and physical affection for one another. The exact nature of this relationship has been widely discussed by historians; some have argued that <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> clearly romantic or erotic, while others have argued that historians have been misled by Roosevelt's exuberant letters. It is known, and was known in the White House press corps at the time, that Hickok was a lesbian. More than 3,000 letters from the pair's correspondence are preserved at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.|$|E
5|$|Aigler {{also played}} an {{important}} role in securing the Big Ten's long-term contract with the Rose Bowl. Prior to the 1947 season, the visiting spot in the Rose Bowl was open to all conferences, and the Big Ten champion only appeared in the Rose Bowl on rare occasions. In November 1946, Aigler was appointed to a five-person steering committee assigned to negotiate an exclusive contract with the Rose Bowl. The Big Ten approved the exclusive arrangement by a vote of 7 to 2, with Illinois and Minnesota the only opponents. <b>The</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> negotiated at meetings between Aigler and the Big Ten steering committee and the Pacific Coast Conference held in Berkeley, California in November 1946. Aigler traveled to California again in May 1947 with William Reed to negotiate administrative details of the Rose Bowl arrangement with Pacific Coast Conference representative William C. Ackerman. The University of Michigan was the first Big Ten participant in the new Rose Bowl arrangement, defeating the USC Trojans 490 in the game held on January 1, 1948.|$|E

Kinne viewed him as a prospect for a second husband, but Jones was uninterested in leaving his wife despite the rockiness of their relationship. When he declined to go on a trip to Washington with her in May, Kinne reluctantly went with her brother instead. Although the couple reunited on May 25, shortly after Kinne returned to Missouri, <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> quickly set on the rocks when Kinne told Jones that she was pregnant and he was the father of the baby. Jones, instead of responding with what Kinne expected to be an agreement to divorce his wife, ended the affair.|$|E
5|$|Germany's {{foreign policy}} {{during the war}} {{involved}} the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies such as Italy and Hungary and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France. By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary. When a country was no longer dependable, Germany assumed full control as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943 and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was an official powerful ally, <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>was</b> distant and there was little co-ordination or co-operation.

While he earlier had written he did not think democracy and human rights was optimal in the country—he considered Botswana to be one of the better countries—he considered rule of law to be better than in countries the Norwegian government had supported financially, such as Idi Amin's Uganda.|$|E
