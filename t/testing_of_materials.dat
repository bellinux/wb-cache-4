500|$|Harrison {{held the}} {{position}} of Director of Aeronautical Inspection throughout World WarII, his staff numbering more than 1,200 by 1945. A reorganisation of the directorate in 1940 had permitted qualified civilian engineers to be recruited for work that required increasing technical expertise, without them having to join the Air Force. In July the same year, Harrison proposed {{the construction of a}} series of test houses to help decentralise chemical, mechanical and metrological <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> used in the manufacture of munitions that previously had to go through either the Munitions Supply Laboratories or the National Standards Laboratory. The result was a major improvement in the speed of testing and, according to the official history of Australia in the war, [...] "a fuller use of the country's scientific and technical manpower". Harrison's daughter Greta joined the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, {{and by the end of}} the war was ranked flight officer.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to present a way to shorten {{the time required to}} perform laboratory <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> in metallurgy. The paper finds a relation between the time to perform a <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> and the number of technicians carrying out the test. The relation can be used to optimize the number of technicians. The approach is based on probability theory, as the amount <b>of</b> <b>material</b> to be <b>tested</b> is unknown in advance, and uses powerful modelling techniques involving the generalized estimating equations.
