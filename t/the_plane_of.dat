5|$|The {{orbit of}} Pallas was {{determined}} by Gauss, who found the period of 4.6 years {{was similar to the}} period for Ceres. Pallas has a relatively high orbital inclination to <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover the planet is that only a lower limit on the mass can be obtained. Further astrometric observations with the Hubble Space Telescope on the outer planet 55 Cancri d suggest that planet is inclined at 53° to <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the sky; but innermost b and e are inclined at 85°. Planet c's inclination is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Also, because real tires have {{a finite}} contact patch {{with the road}} surface that can {{generate}} a scrub torque, and when in a turn, can experience some side slipping as they roll, they can generate torques about an axis normal to <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the contact patch.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Outer <b>Planes</b> were {{presented}} {{for the first}} time in Volume 1, Number 8 of The Dragon, released July 1977. In the article [...] "Planes: The Concepts of Spatial, Temporal and Physical Relationships in D&D", Gary Gygax mentions that there are 16 Outer <b>Planes</b> and describes <b>the</b> Seven Heavens, the Twin Paradises, and Elysium as [...] "Typical higher planes", Nirvana as the [...] "plane of ultimate Law" [...] and Limbo as the [...] "plane of ultimate Chaos (entropy)", and the Nine Hells, Hades' three glooms, and the 666 layers of the Abyss as [...] "Typical lower planes". Other Outer Planes mentioned by name in the article include the Happy Hunting Grounds, Olympus, Gladsheim, Pandemonium, Tarterus, Gehenna, Acheron, and Arcadia. <b>The</b> Outer <b>Planes</b> {{were presented}} again in an appendix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> known <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> existence in <b>the</b> original (1st edition) AD&D Players Handbook, published in June 1978. This appendix included an abstract diagram <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planes,</b> and mentioned <b>the</b> same 16 Outer Planes: The Seven Heavens of absolute lawful good, the Twin Paradises of neutral good lawfuls, <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> Elysium of neutral good, the Happy Hunting Grounds of neutral good chaotics, <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> Olympus of absolute good chaotics, <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> Gladsheim (Asgard, Valhalla, Vanaheim, etc.) of chaotic good neutrals, <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> Limbo of neutral (absolute) chaos (entropy), <b>the</b> <b>Planes</b> <b>of</b> Pandemonium of chaotic evil neutrals, the 666 layers of the Abyss of absolute chaotic evil, <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> Tarterus of evil chaotic neutrals, Hades' [...] "Three Glooms" [...] of absolute (neutral) evil, the furnaces of Gehenna of lawful evil neutrals, the Nine Hells of absolute lawful evil, <b>the</b> nether <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> Acheron of lawful evil neutrals, Nirvana of absolute (neutral) lawfuls, and <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> <b>of</b> Arcadia of neutral good lawfuls.|$|R

5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{made with}} the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the outer planet 55 Cancri d is inclined at 53° with respect to <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the sky. The inner planets b and e are inclined at 85°. The inclination of f is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 the {{discovery}} of a possible dust disk around 55 Cancri A was announced. Calculations gave the disk radius at least 40AU, similar to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System, with an inclination of 25° with respect to <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the sky. However, {{the discovery}} could not be verified and was later deemed to be spurious, caused instead by background galaxies.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{preliminary}} astrometric measurements {{made by the}} Hipparcos probe {{suggested the}} orbit of 47 UMa b is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the sky, implying the planet's true mass is around 2.9 times that of Jupiter. However, subsequent analysis suggested the Hipparcos measurements were not precise enough to accurately determine the orbits of substellar companions, and the inclination and true mass remain unknown.|$|E

5|$|Lipid bilayers exhibit {{high levels}} of {{birefringence}} where the refractive index in <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the bilayer differs from that perpendicular {{by as much as}} 0.1 refractive index units.

5|$|Most {{asteroid}}s {{within the}} asteroid belt have orbital eccentricities of less than 0.4, and an inclination of less than 30°. The orbital distribution of the asteroids reaches a maximum at an eccentricity of around 0.07 and an inclination below 4°. Thus although a typical asteroid has a relatively circular orbit and lies near <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the ecliptic, some asteroid orbits can be highly eccentric or travel well outside the ecliptic plane.|$|E
5|$|Most large {{objects in}} orbit around the Sun lie near <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. The planets {{are very close to}} the ecliptic, whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are {{frequently}} at significantly greater angles to it. All the planets, and most other objects, orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There are exceptions, such as Halley's Comet.|$|E

5|$|Pallas's {{surface is}} most likely {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. With an orbital inclination of 34.8°, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly inclined to <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the asteroid belt, and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|The European Southern Observatory (ESO) has {{confirmed}} {{the presence of}} a planet, Beta Pictoris b, matching previous predictions, through the use of direct imagery, orbiting in <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the debris disk surrounding the star.

5|$|The Moon's {{orbit around}} the Earth is {{inclined}} at an angle of just over 5 degrees to <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the Earth's {{orbit around the}} Sun (the ecliptic).

5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{effects of}} Planet Nine would explain five {{aspects of the}} Solar System: the clustering of the orbits of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (eTNOs); the high perihelia of objects like Sedna that are detached from Neptune's influence; the high inclinations of eTNOs with orbits roughly perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System, high inclination Kuiper belt objects with semi-major axis less than 100 AU, and the obliquity, or tilt, of the Sun's axis relative to <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> the Solar System. While other mechanisms have been offered {{for many of these}} peculiarities the gravitational influence of Planet Nine {{is the only one that}} explains all five. The dynamical effects of Planet Nine also excite the inclinations of scattering objects, which in numerical simulations leaves the inclination distribution of short-period comets with a broader distribution than is observed.|$|E
