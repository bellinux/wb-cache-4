5|$|Unlike {{wind and}} wave, tidal power is an {{inherently}} predictable source. However {{the technology is}} in its infancy and numerous devices are in the prototype stages. Today {{it is known that}} a tall tubular tower with three blades attached to it is the typical profile of a wind turbine, but twenty-five years ago there were a wide variety of different systems being tested. This is the current situation with regard to tidal power. Some systems capture energy from the tides in a vertical direction. The tide comes in and raises the water level in a basin. As the tide lowers the water in the basin is discharged through a turbine. <b>Tidal</b> <b>stream</b> power captures energy from the flow of tides, usually using underwater plant resembling a small wind turbine. An example is Marine Current Turbines SeaGen 1.2MW device at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, which is the largest <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> turbine in the world. To date the only two installed tidal power plants of notable size are the Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea and the Rance Tidal Power Station in Brittany, France, rated at 254 MW and 240 MW respectively. There are also many small scale projects throughout the world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Tidal</b> <b>streams</b> {{are complex}} {{watercourses}} that represent a transitional zone between riverine and marine systems; they occur where fresh and marine waters converge. Because tidal circulation processes cause substantial turbulence in these highly dynamic zones, <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> {{are the most}} productive of water bodies. Their rich biological diversity, combined with the convenience of land and water transports, provide sites for concentrated populations that evolve into large cities. Domestic wastewater is generally discharged directly into <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> in Taiwan, necessitating regular evaluation of the water quality of these streams. Given the complex flow dynamics of <b>tidal</b> <b>streams,</b> only a few models can effectively evaluate and identify pollution levels. This study evaluates the river pollution index (RPI) in <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> by using kriging analysis. This is a geostatistical method for interpolating random spatial variation to estimate linear grid points {{in two or three}} dimensions. A kriging-based method is developed to evaluate RPI in <b>tidal</b> <b>streams,</b> which is typically considered as 1 D in hydraulic engineering.

40|$|This {{volume is}} written by leading {{scientists}} in the field, who review {{the current state of}} our knowledge of <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> in the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy, and in other nearby galaxies.   The cosmological origins of dwarf galaxies and the physical processes by which they are tidally disrupted into streams and incorporated into galaxy halos are discussed.  The techniques that have been used to identify <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> are presented, and will be useful to researchers who would like to find substructures in the next generation of optical sky surveys, including Pan-STARRS and LSST.   The methods that are currently under development to constrain both large scale distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way and the (small scale) lumpiness of the dark matter distribution are also explained.   The authors also provide motivation for future spectroscopic surveys of Milky Way halo stars, which will aid both in the identification of <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> and the constraint of dark matter properties. This volume is aimed at graduate students who are beginning this field of research, but is also a resource for researchers who study <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> and related fields.   In addition to presenting the physical processes by which <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> are created, it also reviews {{the current state of the}} observations and the progress towards utilizing these observations to constrain the distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way.  The book will introduce anyone with a background in astrophysics to the field of <b>tidal</b> <b>streams...</b>|$|R

40|$|The unique {{dynamics}} of the tidal disruption of satellite galaxies is an extremely sensitive probe of long-range interactions between dark-matter particles. Dark-matter forces that are several percent the strength of gravity will lead to order unity changes in {{the ratio of the}} number of stars in the leading and trailing <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> of a satellite galaxy. The approximate symmetry of the stellar <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy would thus exclude attractive dark-matter forces greater than 10 % the strength of gravity which would entirely eliminate the leading stream. However, recent simulations suggest that dark-matter forces 100 % the strength of gravity could completely strip the stellar component of Sagittarius of its dark matter, allowing for the subsequent development of symmetric <b>tidal</b> <b>streams.</b> Here we argue that these simulations use inconsistent initial conditions corresponding to separate pure stellar and pure dark-matter satellites moving independently in the host galaxy's halo, rather than a single disrupting composite satellite as had been intended. A new simulation with different initial conditions, in particular a much more massive satellite galaxy, might demonstrate a scenario in which symmetric <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> develop in the presence of large dark-matter forces.

2500|$|Sea swimming: The {{beach on}} Viking Bay is patrolled by lifeguards {{during the summer}} and is popular with swimmers. Dickens swam there. There are public toilets at the beach level, as well as basic {{changing}} facilities and a single fresh water shower (summer only). The bay is marked by striped posts on rocks at either end, and the bay is alternately full of water at high tide or completely dry at low tide. [...] At high tide, the beach shelf drops off quickly and a swimmer can be out of their depth within a few feet of the shore. At middle and low tides, the shelf is much more gently sloping and it is possible to play in the surf, and even swim, in water that is only waist high. At high tide and middle tide, swimmers that stay within the bay (within the posts) are completely sheltered from the <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> of the English Channel. At any tide, swimmers venturing out beyond the striped posts may encounter a strong tidal current running parallel to the coast, flowing either from south to north or north to south, depending on whether the tide is coming up the English Channel or draining out through it. Even strong experienced swimmers will find it difficult to make progress against this <b>tidal</b> <b>stream</b> at its greatest flow, and swimmers in difficulty should swim directly towards the nearest part of the shore, rather than try to return {{to the point where they}} originally entered.|$|E

40|$|We {{simulate}} <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> in {{the presence}} and absence of substructures inside the zero redshift snapshot of the Via Lactea II (VL- 2) simulation. A halo finder is used to remove and isolate the subhalos found inside the high resolution dark matter halo of VL- 2, and the potentials for both the main halo and all the subhalos are constructed individually using the self-consistent field (SCF) method. This allows us to make direct comparison of <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> between a smooth halo and a lumpy halo without assuming idealized profiles or triaxial fits. We simulate the kinematics of a star cluster starting with the same orbital position but two different velocities. Although these two orbits are only moderately eccentric and have similar apo- and pericentric distances, {{we find that the}} two streams have very different morphologies. We conclude that our model of the potential of VL- 2 can provide insights about <b>tidal</b> <b>streams</b> that have not been explored by previous studies using idealized or axisymmetric models.

60|$|Old writers had {{an admirable}} {{symbolism}} that attributed certain energies {{to the influence}} of the sun, and certain others to the lunar influence. To lunar influence belong all thoughts and emotions that were created by the community, by the common people, by nobody knows who, and to the sun all that came from the high disciplined or individual kingly mind. I myself imagine a marriage of the sun and moon in the arts I take most pleasure in; and now bride and bridegroom but exchange, as it were, full cups of gold and silver, and now they are one in a mystical embrace. From the moon come the folk-songs imagined by reapers and spinners out of the common impulse of their labour, and made not by putting words together, but by mixing verses and phrases, and the folk-tales made by the capricious mixing of incidents known to everybody in new ways, as one deals out cards, never getting the same hand twice over. When one hears some fine story, one never knows whether it has not been hazard that put the last touch of adventure. Such poetry, as it seems to me, desires an infinity of wonder or emotion, for where there is no individual mind there is no measurer-out, no marker-in of limits. The poor fisher has no possession of the world and no responsibility for it; and if he dreams of a love-gift better than the brown shawl that seems too common for poetry, why should he not dream of a glove made from the skin of a bird, or shoes made from the skin of a herring, or a coat made from the glittering garment of the salmon? Was it not Æschylus who said he but served up fragments from the banquet of Homer?--but Homer himself found the great banquet of an earthen floor and under a broken roof. We do not know who at the foundation of the world made the banquet for the first time, or who put the pack of cards into rough hands; but we do know that, unless those that have made many inventions are about to change the nature of poetry, we may have to go where Homer went if we are to sing a new song. Is it because all that is under the moon thirsts to escape out of bounds, to lose itself in some unbounded <b>tidal</b> <b>stream,</b> that the songs of the folk are mournful, and that the story of the Fianna, whenever the queens lament for their lovers, reminds us of songs that are still sung in country-places? Their grief, even when it is to be brief like Grania's, goes up into the waste places of the sky. But in supreme art, or in supreme life there is the influence of the sun too, and the sun brings with it, as old writers tell us, not merely discipline but joy; for its discipline is not of the kind the multitudes impose upon us by their weight and pressure, but the expression of the individual soul, turning itself into a pure fire and imposing its own pattern, its own music, upon the heaviness and the dumbness that is in others and in itself. When we have drunk the cold cup of the moon's intoxication, we thirst for something beyond ourselves, and the mind flows outward to a natural immensity; but if we have drunk from the hot cup of the sun, our own fulness awakens, we desire little, for wherever one goes one's heart goes too; and if any ask what music is the sweetest, we can but answer, as Finn answered, 'What happens.' And yet the songs and stories that have come from either influence are a part, neither less than the other, of the pleasure that is the bride-bed of poetry.|$|E
