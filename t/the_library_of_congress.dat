5|$|The {{film was}} assumed to have been lost for many years until a paper copy was {{identified}} in 1968 in <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> Paper Print archive by Michael Pointer, a historian of Sherlock Holmes films. Because motion pictures were not covered by copyright laws until 1912, paper prints were submitted by studios wishing to register their works. These were made using light-sensitive paper of the same width and length as the film itself, and developed as though a still photograph. Both the Edison Company and the Biograph Company submitted entire motion pictures as paper prints, {{and it is in}} this form that most of them survive. The film has subsequently been transferred to 16 mm film in <b>the</b> <b>Library</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> collection.|$|E
