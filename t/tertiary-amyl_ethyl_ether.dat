40|$|Fuel oxygenates are {{oxygen-containing}} compounds (e. g., ethers and alcohols) {{that are}} added to gasoline either to boost the octane rating, to make the fuel burn cleaner by increas-ing the oxygen content, or to achieve a combination of both. The most commonly used oxygenates are methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethanol. Other oxy-genates include ter-tiary-amyl methyl ether (TAME), ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE), diisopropyl ether (DIPE), <b>tertiary-amyl</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>ether</b> (TAEE), tertiary-butyl alcohol (TBA), tertiary-amyl alcohol (TAA), and methanol. Some oxygenates {{have a long history}} of usage in gasoline. For example, ethanol has been used in automotive fuel blends since the 1930 s. Ethers, and primarily MTBE, have been used increasingly since the late 1970 s. Ini-tially, MTBE was used to boost the octane rating of mid- and high-grade gasoline and was present at concentrations of about 4 to 8 percent by volume. These fuels were transported, stored, and used nationwide. Amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990 led to the implementation of the Oxygenated Fuel (Oxyfuel) and Refor-mulated Gasoline (RFG) programs in 1992 and 1995, respec-tively. While these programs stipulated a minimum oxygen content for gasoline sold in specific metropolitan areas to reduce air pollution, the choice of which oxygenate to use was ■ continued on page...|$|E
40|$|Recently, it was {{reported}} that furfuryl <b>ethyl</b> <b>ether</b> is an important flavor compound indicative of beer storage and aging conditions. A study of the reaction mechanism indicates that furfuryl <b>ethyl</b> <b>ether</b> is most likely formed by protonation of furfuryl alcohol or furfuryl acetate followed by S(N) 2 -substitution of the leaving group by the nucleophilic ethanol. For the reaction in beer, a pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics was derived. A close correlation was found between the values predicted by the kinetic model and the actual furfuryl <b>ethyl</b> <b>ether</b> concentration evolution during storage of beer. Furthermore, 10 commercial beers of different types, aged during 4 years in natural conditions, were analyzed, and {{it was found that the}} furfuryl <b>ethyl</b> <b>ether</b> flavor threshold was largely exceeded in each type of beer. In these natural aging conditions, lower pH, darker color, and higher alcohol content were factors that enhanced furfuryl <b>ethyl</b> <b>ether</b> formation. On the other hand, sulfite clearly reduced furfuryl <b>ethyl</b> <b>ether</b> formation. All results show that the furfuryl <b>ethyl</b> <b>ether</b> concentration is an excellent time-temperature integrator for beer storage. status: publishe...|$|R

The interfacial properties of sterols are tested at the air-water interface. The cholesteryl ethers show a reduced interfacial stability with increasing hydrophobicity of the ether-linked moiety. The {{interaction between the}} sterol derivatives and phospholipids in mixed monolayers is indicated by measuring the deviation from the simple addivity rule (condensing effect). An interaction is found only for cholesteryl (2 ′-hydroxy) - 3 -ethyl ether, cholesteryl methyl <b>ether</b> and cholesteryl <b>ethyl</b> <b>ether.</b> These sterols also reduce the glucose permeability of liposomal membranes in this order. In this respect cholesteryl (2 ′-hydroxy) - 3 -ethyl ether is as effective as cholesterol. Cholesteryl methyl <b>ether</b> and cholesteryl <b>ethyl</b> <b>ether</b> show 62 and 33 percent of the effect observed with cholesterol. The effect of the sterol derivatives on the gel-to-liquid-crystalline phase transition of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine is measured by differential scanning calorimetry.
