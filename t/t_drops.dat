40|$|We {{present a}} theory for {{quasiparticle}} heat transport through superconducting weak links. The thermal conductance {{depends on the}} phase difference (ϕ) of the superconducting leads. Branch conversion processes, low-energy Andreev bound states near the contact and {{the suppression of the}} local density of states near the gap edge are related to phase-sensitive transport processes. Theoretical results for the influence of junction transparency, temperature and disorder, on the phase modulation of the conductance are reported. For high-transmission weak links, D→ 1, the formation of an Andreev bound state at ϵ_ b=Δcos(ϕ/ 2) leads to suppression of the density of states for the continuum excitations that transport heat, and thus, to a reduction in the conductance for ϕ≃π.

Precise experimental observations {{over the last few}} years of end-monomer dynamics in the diffusion of double-stranded DNA have given conflicting results: one study indicated an unexpected Rouse-like scaling of the mean squared displacement (MSD) 〈r 2 (t) 〉 ∼ t 1 / 2 at intermediate times, corresponding to fluctuations at length scales larger than the persistence length but smaller than the coil size; another study claimed the more conventional Zimm scaling 〈r 2 (t) 〉 ∼ t 2 / 3 in the same time range. Using hydrodynamic simulations, analytical and scaling theories, we find a novel intermediate dynamical regime where the effective local exponent of the end-monomer MSD, α(t) = dlog〈r 2 (t) 〉/dlog <b>t,</b> <b>drops</b> below the Zimm value of 2 / 3 for sufficiently long chains. The deviation from the Zimm prediction increases with chain length, though it does not reach the Rouse limit of 1 / 2. The qualitative features of this intermediate regime, found in simulations and in an improved mean-field theory for semiflexible polymers, in particular the variation of α(t) with chain and persistence lengths, can be reproduced through a heuristic scaling argument. Anomalously low values of the effective exponent α are explained by hydrodynamic effects related to the slow crossover from dynamics on length scales smaller than the persistence length to dynamics on larger length scales. ...|$|E
30|$|Because of the {{tellurium}} vacancies or impurities existing, Bi 2 Te 3 usually exhibits {{very good}} electrical conductivity. In Fig.  2, {{the resistance of}} Bi 2 Te 3 ultrathin film presents principally a metallic behavior, consistent with the previous works [8, 9]. It {{can be seen that}} the resistance increases with the temperature increasing at the range of 10 to 300  K, implying that conductivity is dominated by the carrier mobility. As the temperature decreases, the phonon scattering reduces, resulting in the carrier mobility increasing and the resistance decreasing. When the temperature T lowers below 10  K, the resistance is found to increase with T dropping and appears to present lnT dependence below 5  K as shown in the right inset of Fig.  2, presumably due to freezing effect of the carriers, electron-electron interactions and WAL effect [24, 25]. The low temperature less than 10  K usually brings about the absence of inelastic phonon scattering [8], and impurity scattering of the charge carriers should dominate the transport [26]. This impurity scattering substantially does not change with temperature. However, the temperature dropping causes the carrier concentration to diminish, resulting in the resistance increasing. When <b>T</b> <b>drops</b> below 5  K, electron-electron interactions as well as WAL effect probably make important contributions to conduction, at last inducing the lnT dependence of resistance [25]. In addition, the semiconductor-like resistance below 10  K shown in Fig.  2 indicates that bulk conductance of Bi 2 Te 3 ultrathin films is suppressed to a large extent, and surface conduction will act as a non-negligible role [24].|$|E

40|$|The annual {{cycle is}} the {{dominant}} mode of climate variability for most aspects of climate that humans engage with. Trends in the amplitude and timing of the annual cycle have been observed in both the surface temperature record and the atmospheric carbon dioxide record, but causes and significances of these changes remain poorly understood – in part because we lack {{an understanding of the}} character and mechanisms of natural variability. Here we show that the phase of the annual cycle of surface temperature over extratropical land shifted towards earlier seasons by 1. 7 days between 1954 - 2007, and that this change is highly anomalous with respect to earlier variations, which we take as indicative of the natural range. Significant changes in the amplitude of the annual cycle are also observed between 1954 - 2007. The observed land phase trends are explained by the cumulative effects of orbital changes, aliasing of the tropical year by sampling of temperature on the Gregorian calendar and changes in atmospheric circulation described by the Northern Annular Mode and the Pacific North America Pattern. These effects also appear to explain the contemporaneous amplitude gain trends, though this is less unambiguous. Ocean trends, in contrast, appear more significant after taking into account natural sources of variability. The annual cycle of atmospheric carbon dioxide is controlled by variability in the carbon cycling of the terrestrial biosphere. Trends in the annual amplitude, timing of annual carbon draw-down (<b>t</b> <b>drop)</b> and timing of annual carbon rise (t rise) have thus been used to argue for a more photosynthetically active terrestrial biosphere, earlier initiation of biological spring, and increased terrestrial respiration in autumn respectively. We show that changes in amplitude are significant, anomalous when compared against a model of natural variability, spatially coherent over broad latitude bands and related to climate variability. Changes in <b>t</b> <b>drop</b> are neither significant, nor anomalous, and are coherent over only limited spatial scales, indicating <b>t</b> <b>drop</b> is a poor metric for diagnosing large-scale changes in the terrestrial biosphere.

40|$|We analyze {{dephasing}} by electron {{interactions in}} a small disordered quasi-one dimensional (1 D) ring weakly coupled to leads, where we recently predicted a crossover for the dephasing time (T) from diffusive or ergodic 1 D (^- 1 ∝ T^ 2 / 3, T^ 1) to 0 D behavior (^- 1 ∝ T^ 2) as <b>T</b> <b>drops</b> below the Thouless energy. We provide a detailed derivation of our results, based on an influence functional for quantum Nyquist noise, and calculate all leading and subleading terms of the dephasing time in the three regimes. Explicitly {{taking into account the}} Pauli blocking of the Fermi sea in the metal allows us to describe the 0 D regime on equal footing as the others. The crossover to 0 D, predicted by Sivan, Imry and Aronov for 3 D systems, has so far eluded experimental observation. We will show that for T ≪, 0 D dephasing governs not only the T-dependence for the smooth part of the magnetoconductivity but also for the amplitude of the Altshuler-Aronov-Spivak oscillations, which result only from electron paths winding around the ring. This observation can be exploited to filter out and eliminate contributions to dephasing from trajectories which do not wind around the ring, which may tend to mask the T^ 2 behavior. Thus, the ring geometry holds promise of finally observing the crossover to 0 D experimentally.

40|$|We examine {{in detail}} the {{relationship}} between smooth fast quantum quenches, characterized by a time scale δ t, and instantaneous quenches, {{within the framework of}} exactly solvable mass quenches in free scalar field theory. Our earlier studies [1, 2] highlighted that the two protocols remain distinct in the limit δ t → 0 because of the relation of the quench rate to the UV cut-off, i. e., 1 / δ t ≪ Λ always holds in the fast smooth quenches while 1 / δ t ∼ Λ for instantaneous quenches. Here we study UV finite quantities like correlators at finite spatial distances and the excess energy produced above the final ground state energy. We show that at late times and large distances (compared to the quench time scale) the smooth quench correlator approaches that for the instantaneous quench. At early times, we find that for small spatial separation and small δ t, the correlator scales universally with δ t, exactly as in the scaling of renormalized one point functions found in earlier work. At larger separation, the dependence on δ <b>t</b> <b>drops</b> out. The excess energy density is finite (for finite m δ t) and scales in a universal fashion for all d. However, the scaling behaviour produces a divergent result in the limit m δ t → 0 for d ≥ 4, just as in an instantaneous quench, where it is UV divergent for d ≥ 4. We argue that similar results hold for arbitrary interacting theories: the excess energy density produced is expected to diverge for scaling dimensions Δ > d/ 2...|$|E

In Tl 2 Ba 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 we observe no c-axis optical plasmon either above or below T-c. For E//c in La 2 -xSrxCuO 4, no plasmon is observed in the normal state, {{but as soon as}} <b>T</b> <b>drops</b> below T-c, a plasma edge in the reflectivity occurs, which moves up to about 2 k(B) T(c) for T [...] > 0. The electronic contribution to sigma(omega) approximate to 7 Ohm(- 1) cm(- 1) is independent of frequency up to several hundred cm(- 1), which implies that the optical scattering rate (tau(c) (- 1)) is large compared to the c-axis plasma frequency (omega(pc)) We prove experimentally that h/tau(c) > h omega(pc) >> 3. 5 k(B) T(c), hence the c-axis response is in a universality class different from the dirty (Mattis-Bardeen) limit, and the absence of a plasma edge in the normal state is due to overdamping. Recent experimental data of various groups show that this is a generic feature of high-T-c cuprates. There is no need to assume a large many-body reduction of the ab initio LDA-RPA plasma frequency along the c-axis. Yet the overdamping of the plasmon could be a many-body effect. The 'confinement' to the planes as was proposed by Anderson is therefore due to a strong scattering in the c-direction. In the dirty Limit only the relatively small amount of oscillator strength in the below-gap region is transferred to the pair-response (the delta-function at zero frequency).

Though M 31 * is probably ten times heavier, its radio luminosity at 3. 6 cm is only one third that of Sgr A*. At the same time, M 31 * is apparently thousands of times more luminous in X-rays than its Galactic Center counterpart. Thus, a comparative study of these objects can be valuable in helping us to understand the underlying physical basis for their activity. We show here that the accretion model being developed for Sgr A * comprises two branches of solutions, distinguished by {{the relative importance of}} cooling compared to compressional heating at the radius rC where the ambient gas is captured by the black hole. For typical conditions in the ISM, the initial temperature (T[rC] ∼ 106 − 107 K) sits on the unstable branch of the cooling function. Depending on the actual value of T(rC) and the accretion rate, the plasma settles either onto a hot branch (attaining a temperature as high as 10 10 K or so at small radii) or a cold branch, in which <b>T</b> <b>drops</b> to ∼ 104 K.

40|$|It is "conventional wisdom" {{that the}} {{uncertainty}} of local temperature measurements on equilibrium systems diverges exponentially fast as their temperature <b>T</b> <b>drops</b> to zero. In contrast, some exactly solvable models showcase a more benign power-law-like scaling, when only a small non-equilibrium fragment of the equilibrium system is measured. Does this mean that a part may contain {{more information about the}} global temperature than the whole? Certainly not. Here, we resolve this apparent paradox. First, we prove that local quantum thermometry at low T is exponentially inefficient in non-critical, gapped, and infinite spin and harmonic lattices. In contrast, we show through an open-system analysis, that the thermal sensitivity of a harmonic thermometer (probe) jointly equilibrated with a reservoir (sample) by means of an Ohmic coupling scheme, displays a distinctive power-law-like behavior as T → 0. To reconcile these two results, we exploit the fact that local thermometry on a harmonic chain may be viewed as a temperature measurement on an oscillator in a discretized harmonic environment: A gapped translationally invariant chain (for which low [...] T thermometry is indeed exponentially inefficient) maps into a non-standard open-system model where the low-frequency modes of the sample decouple from the probe. On the contrary, a gapless instance of such chain gives rise to the canonical Ohmic probe-sample interaction, which does include sample modes of arbitrarily low frequency. In this way, we show that the power-law-like thermometric performance observed in typical dissipative models {{stems from the fact that}} these are gapless and, as such, not subjected to the exponential limitations of their gapped counterparts. The key feature of many-body systems, when it comes to the ultimate limitations of low [...] T thermometry, is thus whether or not their energy spectrum is gapped.

40|$|We {{consider}} the type II superstring compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds at finite temperature. The latter is implemented at the string level by a free {{action on the}} Euclidean time circle. We show that all Kahler and complex structure moduli involved in the gauge theories geometrically engineered {{in the vicinity of}} singular loci are lifted by the stringy thermal effective potential. The analysis is based on the effective gauged supergravity at low energy, without integrating out the BPS states becoming massless at the singular loci. The universal form of the action in the weak coupling regime at low enough temperature is determined in two cases. Namely the conifold locus, as well as a locus where the internal space develops a genus-g curve of A{N- 1 } singularities, realizing an SU(N) gauge theory coupled to g hypermultiplets in the adjoint. In general, the favored points of stabilization sit at the intersection of several singular loci. Thus the entire vector multiplet moduli space can be lifted, together with hypermultiplet moduli. The scalars are dynamically stabilized during the cosmological evolution induced by the back-reaction of the thermal effective potential. When the universe expands and the temperature <b>T</b> <b>drops,</b> the scalars converge to minima, with damped oscillations. Moreover, they store an energy density that scales as T^ 4, which never dominates over radiation. The {{reason for this is that}} the mass they acquire at one-loop is of order the temperature scale, which is time-dependent. As an example we analyze the type IIA compactification on a Calabi-Yau space with Hodge numbers h{ 11 }= 2 and h{ 12 }= 128. In this case, both Kahler moduli are stabilized, where the internal space develops a node and an enhanced SU(2) gauge theory coupled to 2 adjoint hypermultiplets. This shows that in the dual thermal heterotic picture on K 3 xT^ 2, the torus modulus and the axio-dilaton are stabilized.

This was ideal for the purpose as the area had been captured by Allied forces in September 1944, so damage to the structure could be inspected after bomb tests. Four bombs, carried by two B-17s, were used and two hits scored on the target. The resultant damage was considered satisfactory by Royal Navy observers on the ground.|$|R
