5|$|The 1970 North Indian Ocean cyclone season had no bounds, but {{tropical}} cyclones in the North Indian Ocean tend to form between April and December, with {{peaks in}} May and November. The 1970 season saw {{a total of}} seven cyclonic storms, of which three developed into severe cyclonic storms. The Bay of Bengal was more active than <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea</b> during 1970, {{with all of the}} three severe cyclonic storms in the season forming there. Unusually, none of the storms in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea</b> made landfall this year. The most significant storm of the season was the Bhola cyclone, which formed in the Bay of Bengal and hit Bangladesh on November 12. The storm killed at least 500,000, making it the deadliest tropical cyclone in recorded history.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 India cyclone was {{the second}} strongest {{tropical}} cyclone, in terms of barometric pressure, to form in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea</b> on record; only Cyclone Gonu in 2007 was stronger. The storm originated from a tropical disturbance that formed east of Somalia on May18. Over the following few days, the system gradually organized into a tropical depression. Tracking eastward, towards the coastline of southwestern India, the storm slowly intensified. Shortly before reaching shore, the system turned north and later west, away from land. After taking this turn, the storm intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm, attaining its peak intensity on May24 with winds of 215km/h (135mph 3-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 932mbar (hPa). At the time, this ranked the cyclone as the strongest known storm in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Arabian Peninsula is a {{peninsula}} {{between the}} Red Sea, <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea,</b> and the Persian Gulf. There are 57known tropical cyclones that affected the peninsula, primarily Yemen and Oman. For convenience, storms are included that affected the Yemeni island of Socotra. Most {{of the tropical}} cyclones originated in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea,</b> {{the portion of the}} Indian Ocean north of the equator and west of India. The remainder formed in the Bay of Bengal off India's east coast. Collectively, the 57storms have caused at least US$5.7billion in damage and 1,662deaths. The strongest and most damaging cyclone was Cyclone Gonu, which caused US$4billion in damage and 50fatalities when it struck Oman in 2007. Tropical cyclone damage in the Arabian Peninsula is chiefly due to flooding.|$|E
40|$|Biological {{productivity}} in <b>the</b> western <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea</b> was higher during interglacial than glacial times. In <b>the</b> eastern <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea</b> productivity was higher during the glacials compared to interglacials, {{which is in}} sharp contrast to the southwest monsoon intensity variations. To examine temporal changes in {{productivity in}} <b>the</b> eastern <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea</b> over <b>the</b> last 140 ka, oxygen isotopes, calcium carbonate and organic carbon on three cores (SL- 1 & 4 and SK 129 -CR 05) were analyzed. Oxygen isotope records display distinct glacial and interglacial transitions. In the northeastern (Core SL- 1) and eastern <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea</b> (Core SL- 4) both calcium carbonate and organic carbon variations show no significant systematic relationship with glacial and interglacials periods. In <b>the</b> southeastern <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea</b> (Core SK- 129 -CR 05) calcium carbonate shows high and low values during interglacial and glacials, respectively, and temporal changes in organic carbon concentration are significant only during MIS 5. Differential variation of calcium carbonate and organic carbon concentration at the northeastern and southeastern <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea,</b> and between glacials and interglacials, are attributed to regional differences in sedimentation rates, dilution and preservation, which modify the signal of carbonate and carbon production...|$|R

Out of the twenty species of coccolithophores encountered, Gephyrocapsa oceanica, Emiliania huxleyi, Umbilicosphaera sibogae and Umbellosphaera irregularis were the most abundant. The total coccolithophore fluxes ranged from 28. 5 × 106 m− 2 d− 1 to 50. 3 × 106 m− 2 d− 1 showing seasonality with higher fluxes during the northeast (NE) monsoon and lower fluxes dur-ing the spring intermonsoon. The higher fluxes were attributed to the enhancement of primary production in <b>the</b> central <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea</b> due to southward extent of nutrients from <b>the</b> northeast <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea</b> by <b>the</b> prevailing surface currents. Similarly, the occurrences of relatively lower coc-colithophore fluxes during the spring intermonsoon and southwest (SW) monsoon were attributed to the low nutrients in the warm, shallow surface mixed layer and downwelling {{to the south of}} Findlater Jet respectively in <b>the</b> central <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea.</b> Some of <b>the</b> coccolithophore species such as E. huxleyi, G. oceanica, Calcidiscus leptoporus and Umbellosphaera tenuis showed signs of dissolution. 1...|$|R

40|$|The Asian Monsoon system {{dominates the}} climate over {{large areas of}} the Asian and Indian continents and the {{rainfall}} prevailing during SW-monsoon is decisive for the agriculture of the entire region.

5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones like Gonu {{are extremely}} rare over <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea,</b> and most storms {{in this area}} tend to be small and dissipate quickly. The cyclone caused 50deaths and about $4.2billion in damage (2007USD) in Oman, where the cyclone was considered the nation's worst natural disaster. Gonu dropped heavy rainfall near the eastern coastline, reaching up to 610mm (24inches), which caused flooding and heavy damage. In Iran, the cyclone caused 28deaths and $ in damage (2007USD).|$|E
5|$|On June7, {{small area}} of low {{pressure}} developed off {{the west coast}} of India. Over the following two days, convection associated with the low gradually organized and by June9, satellite intensity estimates from the JTWC reached 55km/h (30mph). A TCFA was subsequently issued for the system before it made landfall in Gujarat early on June10. Although overland, the low maintained significant convection as it turned westward and through its re-emergence into <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea</b> on June11. Once back over water, convection rapidly spread westward in response to an anticyclone over the Arabian Peninsula and Afghanistan. Early on June12, the cyclone was estimated to have attained tropical storm status based on a ship report near the center of 65km/h (40mph) sustained winds and a surface pressure of 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg). Later that day, strong wind shear stemming from the anticyclone displaced convection from the tropical storm by more than 110km (70mi), prompting the final advisory from the JTWC. The remnants of the system were last noted on June13 dissipating over <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Operationally, the cyclone was {{considered}} to be a Category 4 equivalent storm by the JTWC, with peak winds of 215km/h (135mph). This would have made the system the first recorded storm of that intensity on record in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea.</b> However, in post-storm analysis, it was discovered that 1-minute winds did not exceed 205km/h (125mph). The next storm to reach this intensity was Cyclone Gonu in 2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, which became the first known super cyclonic storm in the region. Upon attaining its peak intensity, the storm attained a barometric pressure of 932mbar (hPa), the lowest in the region at the time. The cyclone was ranked as the strongest in <b>the</b> <b>Arabian</b> <b>Sea</b> for six years until it was surpassed by Gonu in 2007, which attained a minimum pressure of 920mbar (hPa).
