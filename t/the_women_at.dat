5|$|At a {{bachelor}} auction, the available bachelors on display are deemed undesirable, and the auction generates no money at all. Marge then nominates Apu, who is deemed a success by <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>at</b> the auction. He goes out on dates {{with many of}} the town's women, and begins to enjoy his bachelor lifestyle. However, he receives a letter from his mother in India, reminding him of his arranged marriage to Manjula, the daughter of a family friend. Not wanting to get married, Apu asks Homer for advice, who suggests Apu tell his mother that he is already married. Days later, Apu thinks that he has escaped the marriage until he sees his mother walking towards the Kwik-E-Mart. To cover him, Homer tells Apu to pretend that Marge is his wife.|$|E

25|$|On 23 October 1827, John Palmer was at Lahaina, Hawaii. There {{local women}} {{came on board}} and bartered sexual favors for goods, in {{violation}} of the local government's prohibition of such activities. When Clark took a boat ashore, Maui Governor Hoapili, responding to concerns of Christian missionaries living there, seized Clark and the sailors manning the boat. Hoapili agreed to release the men on the understanding that Clark would land <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>at</b> Lahaina. Clark had left instructions with the mate to fire some shots if Clark had not returned in an hour. Before Clark returned to John Palmer the mate fired five 9-pounder shots towards the house of the missionary William Richards, some of which landed in the yard without doing serious damage. Richards and his wife took shelter in the basement. Clark and his men returned to John Palmer and then sailed off without landing the women.|$|E

25|$|The late 6th-century Rabbula Gospel {{book which}} {{includes}} {{one of the}} earliest Crucifixion sequences in a manuscript also depicts an empty tomb under the Crucifixion panel, with an angel seated there who greets two women. Rays of light strike down Roman soldiers, and Jesus greets the two women, who kneel to adore him. Several of the 6th-century pilgrimage souvenir Monza ampullae show the two women and angel, reflecting the scene pilgrims to Christ's tomb saw in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, including a quasi-liturgical re-enactment of this scene apparently staged there. From {{the second half of the}} 7th century, depictions of a risen Christ walking in the garden start to appear in conjunction with the two women and the angel in Western art. Later depictions of <b>the</b> <b>Women</b> <b>at</b> the Sepulchre have also apparently been influenced by quasi-liturgical re-enactments; in Western monasteries monks dressed as the angel and the women and re-enacted the scene on Easter morning, which was called the Visitatio.|$|E

25|$|Goan Catholics have {{retained}} many Indian customs and traditions. Ros (anointing) ceremony, held {{one or two}} days before a wedding, involves the parents, relatives, and friends blessing the bride and groom, who are anointed with ros, a mixture of coconut juice and coconut oil. Later, it is followed by the Resper (Nuptial Blessing in Church) and finally the Kazar (wedding) and Vor (wedding party). <b>The</b> <b>women</b> <b>at</b> a Goan Catholic wedding generally wear gowns or dresses while the men (including the bridegroom) are attired in western-style suits. Contemporary Goan Catholics typically have a White wedding, with the bride wearing a western-style virgin-white wedding gown. The bridal entourage usually consists of the maid of honour, bridesmaids, best man, groomsmen, ringbearer boys, and flower girls. Ballroom dancing and live western-style band music {{are an integral part of}} a Goan Catholic wedding reception. Other traditions include Soirik (betrothal), Amontron (wedding invitation), and Mudi (engagement) ceremony. Indian traditions include adorning the bride with the Saddo (red dress or sari), which is to be worn on the first day after the marriage. It is also the name of the ceremony of cutting and sewing the dress. The Chuddo (a ceremony during which bangles are worn by the bride), Bhuim jevonn (a ritual meal in honour of the ancestors) or Bikariam jevonn (a meal for the poor or beggars), the Opsun divnchem (giving away the bride formally by the father or the guardian of the bride), the Appoune or Porthopon (invitation to the bride's house), and Konsachem fest (harvest festival) that involves blessing of new harvests are other Goan Catholic celebrations.|$|E

500|$|The two writers had {{different}} temperaments: Shōnagon was witty, clever, and outspoken; Murasaki was withdrawn and sensitive. Entries in Murasaki's diary {{show that the}} two {{may not have been}} on good terms. Murasaki wrote, [...] "Sei Shōnagon... was dreadfully conceited. She thought herself so clever, littered her writing with Chinese characters, [...] left a great deal to be desired." [...] Keene thinks that Murasaki's impression of Shōnagon could have been influenced by Shōshi and <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>at</b> her court because Shōnagon served Shōshi's rival empress. Furthermore, he believes Murasaki was brought to court to write Genji in response to Shōnagon's popular Pillow Book. Murasaki contrasted herself to Shōnagon in a variety of ways. She denigrated the pillow book genre and, unlike Shōnagon who flaunted her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki pretended to not know the language.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Girl" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and released in mid-February along with the video for [...] "Cater 2 U". It was inspired by Sex and the City, containing elements and influences of the sitcom in many scenes. The clip is split into two different sets: Destiny's Child in Beyoncé's apartment and the same trio on a fictional television show. It begins with Michelle and Kelly entering Beyoncé's apartment as she writes on her laptop. They settle down with snacks and wine as they watch a fictional show styled after Sex and the City. After the opening credits, Beyoncé and Michelle meet Kelly on the TV for lunch at a restaurant. Throughout the video, <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>at</b> home respond {{to the events of}} the program through gestures and actions, while, on the television, the dialogue of the song matches their conversations in the restaurant. Beyoncé confronts Kelly about her sad demeanor and suspected boyfriend problems, but she feigns shock and insists that nothing is wrong; however, neither Michelle nor Beyoncé are convinced. Viewers can see that, on one occasion, her boyfriend took very long to come home without explanation and, when he finally arrived, a hurt Kelly threw his food away before running upstairs avoiding him.|$|E

Another Bobbio scene shows a Virgin Orant flanked by John the Baptist and his father Zacharias. Figures that appear to be images of pilgrims, as a kind of generalised donor portrait, appear in many scenes, usually kneeling, as part of the emphasis on the pilgrim experience noted above in discussing the Doubting Thomas scenes.|$|E
