5|$|In Costa Mesa, California, a {{young man}} named Donald Pankow {{approaches}} the drive-thru of a Lucky Boy fast food restaurant. Despite the restaurant being closed, Pankow angrily demands service. The sheepish fast food attendant tells <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> drive to the next window, where he is attacked and violently pulled out of his car. Pankow's body is later discovered with the brain removed from the skull. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are assigned to assist the local police in their investigation.|$|E
5|$|In the {{alternative}} image for this stage, produced as a woodcut by Bell, Tom is shown {{with his hands}} free. There are also differences in {{the wording of the}} letter and some items, like the lantern and books, are larger and simpler while others, such as <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> the left of Tom and the topiary bush, have been removed. The owl has become a winged hourglass on the clock tower.|$|E
5|$|In {{the desert}} near Cedar City, Utah, a {{hitchhiker}} catches a ride from a passing bus, which soon stops without explanation. The hitchhiker watches {{a man with}} crutches leave the bus, joined by the other passengers. Following them, he sees them stone <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> death. They later surround the hitchhiker as he futilely tries to escape.|$|E

5|$|She {{remained}} laid up {{for some}} time, before being put to varied use around England, Scotland and Ireland. In November 1846, Isambard Kingdom Brunel's iron ship SS Great Britain ran aground on the sands of Dundrum Bay, Ireland. There was doubt as to whether she could be re-floated. Brunel advised that if anyone could rescue the ship then <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> do it was the naval engineer James Bremner. He was engaged and the Great Britain was re-floated on 27 August 1847 {{with the assistance of}} HMS Birkenhead.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor prepares {{some food}} and blindfolds The Man. He leads <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>to</b> {{a part of}} the {{hospital}} where a woman is kept, and gives her the food. The Brute sets fire to {{the front door of the}} hospital, though The Doctor and The Man extinguish the flames. The Man and The Doctor go to bring food to the woman again, and The Man gives her a wrapped gift. They then catch The Brute attempting to saw through the iron bar gate, though are able to scare him off.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Andrew Flintoff {{following}} an injury would reignite the ongoing debate about which two of Cook, Bell and Collingwood {{should be included}} in the team, with many speculating that Collingwood would be <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> miss out. With the sudden departure of Marcus Trescothick from the tour just over a week before the First Test, the debate was settled for the time being.|$|E
60|$|Leaving <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> {{carry out}} his orders, he ran upstairs again.|$|R
25|$|She {{asked one}} of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> hand over his weapons, but he refused.|$|R
60|$|Two {{days later}} the mutinous Nineteenth were disbanded at Barrackpore. On the 3rd of April Mangul Pandy, who had only wounded himself, was hung, and the same doom was allotted to a native officer of his regiment, for refusing <b>to</b> order <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> assist <b>the</b> officer {{attacked}} by that mutineer, and for himself inciting <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>to</b> rise against <b>the</b> government.|$|R
5|$|After {{she turned}} 15, Falle {{had her first}} {{experience}} in the sex industry {{at a party in}} a bar in Chinatown, Calgary. A 25-year-old man at the party who had forged identity documents convinced her to sell sex for money and give him half of her earnings. Falle found this man well-dressed and attractive and did not think that he fit the stereotypical image of a pimp. She had nowhere to sleep that night and had no money for food, so she accepted his offer. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> whom she sold sex that night had teeth that were rotten. They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E
5|$|During an {{engagement}} early in June 1915 Walpole single-handedly rescued a wounded soldier; his Russian comrades refused {{to help and}} Walpole carried {{one end of a}} stretcher and dragged <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> safety. For this he was awarded the Cross of Saint George; General Lechitsky presented him with the medal in August. After his tour of duty Walpole returned to Petrograd. Among the city's attractions for him was the presence of Konstantin Somov, a painter with whom he had formed a close relationship. He remained there until October 1915, when he returned to England. He visited his family, stayed with Percy Anderson in London, telephoned Henry James in Rye, and retreated to a cottage he had bought in Cornwall. In January 1916 he was asked by the Foreign Office to return to Petrograd. Russians were being subjected to highly effective German propaganda. The writer Arthur Ransome, Petrograd correspondent of The Daily News, had successfully lobbied {{for the establishment of a}} bureau to counter the German efforts, and the British ambassador, Sir George Buchanan, wanted Walpole to take charge.|$|E
5|$|Hearing noise, Mulder heads {{outside and}} {{witnesses}} a UFO flying overhead; inside, small beings run past Scully. Cars full of armed soldiers arrive, forcing the agents to flee. The agents meet with Skinner at a diner in rural Maryland. Skinner wants {{to turn over}} the tape in exchange for their reinstatement and safety. After initially objecting, Mulder agrees to let Skinner turn the tape over. Skinner heads to see Melissa in the hospital and is told by Albert of the mysterious blue-suited man outside. Skinner chases <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> a stairwell where he is attacked by Alex Krycek and Luis Cardinal, who beat him unconscious and steal the tape.|$|E

50|$|In 1985 Sir Edmund Hillary (<b>the</b> first <b>man</b> <b>to</b> {{stand on}} <b>the</b> summit of Mount Everest) and Neil Armstrong (<b>the</b> first <b>man</b> <b>to</b> stand on <b>the</b> moon) landed at the North Pole {{in a small}} twin-engined ski plane.

5|$|Lad's mate Lady is {{run over}} {{and killed by}} a {{speeding}} driver who deliberately aimed his car at her. Lad and his owners both saw the crime, but were unable {{to catch up to}} the driver in time. Lad grieves terribly until they go to a local tennis tournament where he finds Lady's killer. He attacks <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> kill him, but the Master calls him off. The Mistress explains to the shocked crowd what the man had done, then takes a cured Lad home. They later learn that the crowd destroyed the man's expensive car and he was expelled from the club for killing Lady.|$|E
5|$|Later, Scully {{speaks with}} the man. He claims he {{received}} his burns due to alien testing and that he knew Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). He further elaborates that {{he was sent to}} the FBI to retrieve certain files. Scully suspects the man is lying, but asks to examine his burns to investigate his strange claims. He notes that they are the result of an injection that failed to transform him into one of the aliens. The man claims a new conspiracy has formed after the previous one was destroyed; the new one being hidden within the government and the conspirators involved being alien. Doggett theorizes that the man is actually Mulder. Scully takes <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> her house to give him the files he seeks. Suddenly, William begins to cry, only to be quieted when the scarred man picks him up. Meanwhile, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) meets with Doggett and the two discuss the idea that the man is actually Mulder. Skinner points out the inconsistencies in Doggett's reasoning, but a DNA test is undertaken anyway.|$|E

By the time Homer reaches the school with the new reed, however, Lisa has already butchered her performance. Humiliated and upset, she completely ignores Homer, who, from watching old family videos, soon realizes how much he has neglected her.|$|E

5|$|On July 2, 1862, William and Jim Anderson {{returned}} to Council Grove and sent an accomplice to Baker's house {{claiming to be}} a traveler seeking supplies. Baker and his brother-in-law brought <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> a store, where they were ambushed by the Anderson brothers. After a brief gunfight, Baker and his brother-in-law fled into the store's basement. The Andersons barricaded {{the door to the}} basement and lit the store on fire, killing Baker and his brother-in-law. They also burnt Baker's home and stole two of his horses before returning to Missouri on the Santa Fe Trail.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1951, Medical Corpsman Serrano {{was serving}} with the 3rd Battalion, Seventh Marines, 1st Marine Division (Reinforced), in Korea. The Battalion came under heavy enemy attack and fearlessly dashed through the heavy enemy fire {{to reach a}} wounded Marine, he accidentally tripped the wire of a hidden anti-personnel mine. Hearing the snap of the fuse primer, and realizing that his wounded comrade lay {{helpless}} beside the deadly explosive, he courageously and with complete disregard for his own personal safety threw himself on <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> shield him from the explosion. Although he was seriously wounded {{in the back and}} legs by fragments, and was blown several feet by the concussion, he crawled back to his comrade and administered first aid to him. Although suffering severe pain from his multiple wounds, he refused to seek medical aid for himself until he had completed treatment of his comrade, and then, refusing a stretcher, crawled part of the way to the aid station.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and The Man prepare {{food for}} the woman, yet this time The Doctor permits <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> not be blindfolded, and {{encourages}} him to comb his hair. Meanwhile, it is revealed that The Brute has breached the iron gate to the hospital. The Doctor is killed {{on the way to}} the woman when chunks of rock rain down from the sky. The Man, who does not know how to find the woman without The Doctor, attempts to locate her, though he is confronted by The Brute. A fight ensues, with The Man eventually killing The Brute.

5|$|The mid-ground shows a crowd scene {{above the}} group of mourners, {{separated}} by two soldiers who stand between the two groupings. The mourners from the foreground {{are reflected in the}} shield carried on the hip of the lance-bearing Roman soldier who leans on <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> his right wearing a red turban. Smith believes this serves to highlight the mourners' emotional and physical separation from the assorted figures gathered in the mid-ground. Art historian Adam Labuda sees these two figures, positioned full-length between the chief mourners and mid-ground spectators, as a pictorial device that along with the Magdalene's upward gaze draws viewers' eyes upwards through the panel's dramatic sequence.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Bond's stolen {{truck is}} intercepted along its escape route by a SPECTRE helicopter, but 007 destroys the attacking {{aircraft}} by shooting its co-pilot with his sniper rifle, causing <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> drop a live hand grenade in the cockpit. Thus, Bond and Romanova {{make it to}} Grant's escape boat on the Dalmatian coast and steal that, too, only to be pursued by Morzeny, who leads a squadron of SPECTRE powerboats. Bond, however, escapes by dumping his own powerboat's fuel drums overboard and detonating them with a Very flare to engulf all the chase boats {{in a sea of}} flames.|$|E
5|$|The {{team did}} not have any rider {{highlighted}} as a favorite entering the Giro di Lombardia; pre-race analyses held Gilbert as <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> beat. Zaugg rode {{at the front of the}} race the entire day, riding off the front to occupy first position as the solo leader on the Villa Vergano climb. He then maintained his advantage on the alternating flat sections and remaining climbs (the Muro dell'Alpino and the finishing climb in Lecco), holding on for victory ahead of 's Dan Martin and 's Joaquim Rodríguez by 8 seconds. The victory was not only Zaugg's first monument classic win, or even his first single-day win, it was his first professional victory of any kind, coming at age 30. Post-race analysis compared Zaugg's triumph to some of the more notable upsets to which the race has played host in its history.|$|E
