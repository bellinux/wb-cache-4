Hudson was convicted of assault with intent to kill and sentenced to four years imprisonment. He appealed to <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> and was granted bail.

5|$|Where society's need is great, {{no other}} {{effective}} means of meeting the need is available, and intrusion on people's privacy is minimal, certain discretionless checkpoints toward that end may briefly detain motorists. In United States v. Martinez-Fuerte (1976), <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> allowed discretionless immigration checkpoints. In Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz (1990), <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> allowed discretionless sobriety checkpoints. In Illinois v. Lidster (2004), <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> allowed focused informational checkpoints. However, in City of Indianapolis v.

5|$|The Right to Constitutional Remedies {{empowers}} {{citizens to}} approach <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> of India to seek enforcement, or protection against infringement, of their Fundamental Rights. Article 32 provides a guaranteed remedy, {{in the form}} of a Fundamental Right itself, for enforcement of all the other Fundamental Rights, and <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> is designated as the protector of these rights by the Constitution. <b>The</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> has been empowered to issue writs, namely habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari and quo warranto, for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights, while the High Courts have been empowered under Article 226 – which is not a Fundamental Right in itself – to issue these prerogative writs even in cases not involving the violation of Fundamental Rights. <b>The</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> has the jurisdiction to enforce the Fundamental Rights even against private bodies, and in case of any violation, award compensation as well to the affected individual. Exercise of jurisdiction by <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> can also be suo motu or on the basis of a public interest litigation. This right cannot be suspended, except under the provisions of Article 359 when a state of emergency is declared.|$|E

5|$|Although only <b>the</b> United States <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> can {{overturn}} <b>the</b> {{decisions of}} <b>the</b> Oregon <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court,</b> they cannot overturn decisions exclusively {{based on the}} Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of <b>the</b> Oregon <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court.</b> <b>The</b> U.S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> can only accept cases from <b>the</b> Oregon <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> if <b>the</b> decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change {{the outcome of the}} case. <b>The</b> Oregon <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> is <b>the</b> final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Supreme</b> <b>Court</b> cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground).
