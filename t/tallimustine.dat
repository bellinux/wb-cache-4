They are 2 - to 50 -fold less cytotoxic than <b>tallimustine,</b> with compound 8 being the most potent member of this series. Among <b>tallimustine</b> isosters, the compounds with an indole 3 or benzothiophene 6 are 4 -fold less cytotoxic than <b>tallimustine,</b> while the compounds with an N-methyl indole or benzofuran showed a 7 - and 14 -fold reduced cytotoxic potency, respectively.

40|$|The combitiatorial {{approach}} {{restriction endonuclease}} protection selection and amplification REPSA was successfully {{used to determine}} ideal DNA interactions sites of covalent ligands. Unlike most other combinatorial methods, REPSA is based on inhibition of enzymatic cleavage by specific ligand-DNA complexes, which enables identification of binding sites of various ligands. However, the inherent nature of this technique posses a problem during selection of binding sites of covalent ligands. By modifying the technique according {{to the nature of}} the ligand, we demonstrate the flexibility of REPSA in identifying the preferred binding sites for monocovalent ligands, topoisomerase I and <b>tallimustine,</b> and the bicovalent ligand topoisomerase II. From among the preferred binding sites, we identified the consensus binding sequence of camptothecin induced topoisomerase I cleavage as ‘aGWT/Gc’, and <b>tallimustine</b> consensus sequences as ‘GTTCTA’ and ‘TTTTTTC’. We have shown for the first time that preferential binding of <b>tallimustine</b> occurs at sequences not previously reported. Furthermore, our data indicate that <b>tallimustine</b> is a novel DNA minor groove, guanine-specific alkylating agent. ^ Additionally, we have demonstrated in vivo that sequence-specific covalent DNA-binding small molecules have the ability to regulate transcription by inhibiting RNA polymerase II. <b>Tallimustine,</b> binding to its preferred sequences located in the 5 ′ untranslated region were an effective impediment for transcribing polymerase II. The ability of covalent binding small molecules to target predetermined DNA sequences located downstream of the promoter suggests a general approach for regulation of gene expression. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the myelotoxicity and the anti-tumor potential of <b>tallimustine,</b> {{three of its}} analogues and carzelesin, with melphalan as reference substance. <b>Tallimustine</b> was tested by clonogenic assays on both human bone marrow (BM) and cord blood (hCB) cells, the other compounds on hCB only. The degree of inhibition of the haemopoietic progenitors GM-CFC, CFC-E and BFU-E was evaluated after exposure to different concentrations. The same schedules were tested on five tumour cell lines. We found that the dose-response curves for <b>tallimustine</b> on BM and hCB cells were similar. Carzelesin was shown {{to be the most}} potent of the substances tested and to be the one with the best in vitro therapeutic index; of the distamycin analogues, the one bearing an alpha-bromoacrylic group (FCE 25450) had the best index. For melphalan, <b>tallimustine</b> and carzelesin, the concentration inhibiting the growth of 70 % of progenitor cells in vitro (ID 70) was similar to the concentrations found in the serum of patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). We conclude that hCB cells may be used instead of BM cells for in vitro myelotoxicity tests. Therapeutic indexes can be extrapolated from this model and could help in selecting the most promising analogue for further clinical development. The in vitro-active concentrations are similar to myelotoxic concentrations in patients, suggesting a predictive value for the assay...|$|E

Differentiation of K 562 cells is associated with an increase of expression of embryo-fetal globin genes, such as the zeta-, epsilon- and gamma-globin genes. The K 562 cell line has been proposed as a very useful in vitro model system to determine the therapeutic potential of new differentiating compounds as well as to study the molecular mechanism(s) regulating changes in the expression of embryonic and fetal human globin genes. Inducers of erythroid differentiation stimulating gamma-globin synthesis could be considered for possible use in the therapy of haematological diseases associated with a failure in the expression of normal beta-globin genes. We have analysed the effects of <b>tallimustine</b> and distamycin on cell growth and differentiation of K 562 cells. The results demonstrated that <b>tallimustine</b> is a potent inducer, while distamycin is a weak inducer, of K 562 cell erythroid differentiation. Erythroid differentiation was associated with an increase of accumulation of gamma-globin mRNA and of production of both haemoglobin (Hb) Gower 1 and Hb Portland. In addition, tallimustine-mediated erythroid induction occurred in the presence of activation of the apoptotic pathway. The reasons for proposing <b>tallimustine</b> as an inducer of gamma-globin gene expression are strongly sustained by the finding that this compound stimulates fetal haemoglobin production in human erythroid precursor cells from normal subjects...|$|E
40|$|The {{antibiotic}} distamycin A is a DNA minor groove binding drug (MGB) {{that recognizes}} {{a stretch of}} at least four ATs. The alkylating benzoyl mustard derivative <b>tallimustine</b> (FCE 24517) has powerful anti-tumor activity. Using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) we determined that both compounds can prevent binding of TBP and, with 10 -fold higher concentration, TBP-TFIIA (DA) and TBP-TFIIA-TFIIB (DAB) to a TATA box. Once formed, the DA and DAB complexes are more resistant to MGB challenge. Both drugs can inhibit basal in vitro transcription of a minimal TATA-containing promoter and similar concentrations are necessary for binding and transcriptional inhibition. <b>Tallimustine</b> shows strong selectivity by decreasing only correctly initiated transcripts. Even at high doses (20 microM), however, they cannot disturb a competent pre-initiation complex or Pol II progression.

The new derivatives were prepared by coupling nitrogen mustard-substituted, benzoyl nitrogen mustard-substituted, or alpha-bromoacryloyl-substituted benzoheterocyclic carboxylic acids 23 - 32 with desformyldistamycin (33) or in one case with its two-pyrrole analogue 35. With very few exceptions, the activities of compounds bearing the same alkylating moiety are slightly affected {{by the kind of}} the heteroatom present on the benzoheterocyclic ring. All novel compounds, with one exception, showed in vitro activity against L 1210 murine leukemia cell line comparable to or better than that of <b>tallimustine.</b> The compounds in which the nitrogen mustard and the alpha-bromoacryloyl moieties are directly linked to benzoheterocyclic ring showed potent cytotoxic activities (IC(50) ranging from 2 to 14 nM), while benzoyl nitrogen mustard derivatives of benzoheterocycles showed reduced cytotoxic activities, and one compound (16) of this cluster was the sole derivative devoid of significant activity.

These cell lines showed a similar stable low level of resistance (approximately 3 -fold) to CDDP and cross-resistance to carboplatin, iproplatin and the new alkylating agent <b>tallimustine,</b> but not to L-PAM (L-phenylalanine mustard) and BCNU (1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea). Collateral sensitivity to two inhibitors of topoisomerase II, VP 16 (etoposide) and doxorubicin (Dox), but cross-resistance to the topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin, were observed. The two cell lines were also sensitive to 5 -fluorouracil. No {{increase in the level}} of glutathione or activity of glutathione S-transferase could be observed in resistant cells compared with the parental M 5 cells. Total DNA platination immediately after treatment was similar in the parental and resistant cell lines. Repair of total DNA platination, measured after 24 h of recovery, was undetectable in M 5 and MS/CDDP cells, but was 33 % in M 5 /CDDPc cells. Initial DNA-interstrand cross-links (DNA-ISC) were six times higher in M 5 than in M 5 /CDDP cells, but 24 h after treatment, both lines had completely repaired this damage. M 5 /CDDPc cells did not show formation of DNA-ISC at any time after treatment. The two resistant cell lines were tumorigenic when implanted in mice and resistant to CDDP treatment in vivo. The CDDP resistant tumours were not cross-resistant in vivo to L-PAM, BCNU and Dox, which had been active in vitro, nor to <b>tallimustine,</b> which had been cross-resistant in vitro. Mechanisms of resistance in M 5 /CDDP and M 5 -CDDPc seem to be based on a lower formation of DNA-ISC combined, for the latter cell line, with a higher repair capacity for total DNA platination.

We {{have used a}} stable Hoechst 33342 -resistant murine L cell system (HoeR 415) to study resistance patterns, removing the need for SP isolation before microarray analysis of gene expression and the tracking of cell cycle dynamics and cytotoxicity. The majority of HoeR 415 cells displayed a side-population phenotype comparable {{with that of the}} side-population resident in the ABCG 2 over-expressing A 549 lung cancer cell line. Photo-crosslinking showed direct protection against minor groove ligand residence on DNA, driven by ABCG 2 -mediated efflux and not arising from any binding competition with endogenous polyamines. The covalent minor-groove binding properties of the drug FCE 24517 (<b>tallimustine)</b> prevented resistance suggesting a mechanism for overcoming SP-related drug resistance. Hoechst 33342 -resistant murine cells showed lower but significant crossresistance to topotecan, again attributable to enhanced ABCG 2 expression, enabling cells to evade S-phase arrest.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of action of many antitumor agents involves DNA damage, either by direct binding of the drug to DNA or to DNA-binding proteins. However, most of the DNA-interacting agents have only a limited degree of sequence specificity, which implies that they may hit all the cellular genes. DNA minor groove binders, among which the derivs. of distamycin A play an important role, could provide significant improvement in cancer management, increasing gene specificity, due to high selectivity of interaction with thymine-adenine (TA) rich sequences. Here, the authors report and discuss the synthesis, in vitro and in vivo activities, and some mechanistic features of -haloacrylamido derivs. of distamycin A. The final result of this work was the selection of brostallicin (its HCl salt is PNU- 166196). Brostallicin, presently in phase II clin. trials, shows {{a broad spectrum of}} antitumor activity and an apoptotic effect higher than distamycin deriv. <b>tallimustine.</b> An important in vitro toxicol. feature of brostallicin is the very good ratio between myelotoxicity on human hematopoietic progenitor cells and cytotoxicity on tumor cells, in comparison with clin. tested DNA minor groove binders. A peculiarity of brostallicin is its in vitro reactivity in the DNA alkylation assays only in the presence of glutathione. Moreover brostallicin's antitumor activity, both in in vitro and in vivo tumor models, is higher in the presence of increased levels of glutathione/glutathione-S-transferase. These findings contribute to the definition of brostallicin as a novel anticancer agent that differs from other minor groove binders and alkylating agents for both the profile of activity and the {{mechanism of}} action and to classify the -bromoacrylamido derivs. of distamycin as a new class of cytotoxics.

Intracellular levels of putrescine and spermidine were markedly reduced by ODC inhibitors while the level of spermine, which is the main polyamine in nuclei, was unchanged. By combining a novel inhibitor of ODC, such as (2 R, 5 R) - 6 -heptyne- 2, 5 -diamine (MDL 72. 175, MAP), with an inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC), such as 5 '-[[(Z) - 4 -aminobut- 2 -enyl]methylamino]- 5 '-deoxyadenosine (MDL 73. 811, AbeAdo), spermine was selectively depleted in a human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR- 3 (i. e. spermine became almost undetectable whereas the levels of spermidine and putrescine were not affected). The depletion of spermine blocked DNA synthesis with a consequent accumulation of cells in the G 1 phase of the cell cycle. Pretreatment with MAP plus AbeAdo did not change the cytotoxicity of alkylating agents, such as L-phenylalanine mustard (L-PAM), 1, 4 -bis(2 '-chloroethyl) - 1, 4 -diazabicyclo-[2. 2. 1] heptane diperchlorate (DABIS), 1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea (BCNU), cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cis-DDP), N-deformyl-N-[4 -N-N,N-bis (2 -chloroethylamino) benzoyl] (<b>tallimustine)</b> or CC- 1065, whereas it markedly reduced the cytotoxicity of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, such as doxorubicin (DX) and 4 '-demethylepipodophyllotoxin- 5 -(4, 6 -O) -ethylidene- beta-D-glycopyranoside (VP- 16).
