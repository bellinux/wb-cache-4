5|$|When conjuring tricks with {{playing cards}} became popular around the 19th century, magicians would often include card flourishes in their {{performances}} {{to demonstrate their}} sleight of hand abilities. Unlike tricks, flourishes were intended to be visually impressive and appear difficult to perform. Some of the first flourishes to be documented include the Charlier Cut, Riffle Shuffle and Thumb Fan. Several sleight of hand bestsellers, such as S. W. Erdnase's The Expert at <b>the</b> <b>Card</b> <b>Table</b> from 1902 (which shared roots in gambling and cheating at cards), {{emphasized the importance of}} incorporating flourishes into tricks. Up until the 2000s, card flourishing were considered a mere subsection of close-up magic and not an independent performance art.|$|E

500|$|In Arhanghelii, the {{implicit}} Christian lesson {{is about the}} love of money and its devastation of an Apuseni get-rich mining community. At {{the heart of the}} novel is a former notary, Rodean, whose gold claim appears to be endlessly productive and corrupting. As Șăineanu writes: [...] "with emotion and mounting interest, we witness here the ephemeral joys and disasters that this modern-day Moloch pours over this once-peaceful village." [...] The novel, Lovinescu argues, is overall [...] "awkward", but still interesting as a social fresco, called a [...] "frightening human torment" [...] by Iorga. Șăineanu deplores its [...] "prolixity" [...] and arcane mining terminology. As argued by Dragomirescu, the climax, where Rodean runs from <b>the</b> <b>card</b> <b>table</b> to see his mine collapsing, [...] "has remarkable qualities of literary vividness and vigor." [...] Nicolae Manolescu offers praise to the work, a [...] "solidly realistic novel" [...] that, although widely seen as a pastiche from Slavici, should still be taken into account for its [...] "originality and newness". He sees Agârbiceanu as an [...] "unlucky" [...] novelist, whose work was eclipsed by that of Rebreanu, Mihail Sadoveanu, and Gala Galaction, which it only resembles coincidentally.|$|E
500|$|Gates {{was raised}} on the family's farm, but did not care for farm life. [...] At an early age, he entered into his first {{business}} proposition: to husk a neighbor's corn. His next business venture was to clear some land of timber for another neighbor. [...] Gates earned US$1,000 for this job, selling the timber as firewood to homes and to the railroad. Gates then took the money from this labor and bought a half interest in a threshing machine. As this type of equipment was very new at the time, few farms owned one, so Gates and his partner hired themselves out to work with it at various local farms. After one season, Gates tired {{of this type of}} work and he sold his interest in the threshing machine to his partner and another friend. Gates then set himself up as a local grain broker, doing business from the family's home. [...] This business venture was a failure; in an effort to escape farm work, he took to spending time at the railroad depot where he had previously sold firewood. The railroad men remembered him and now asked him to join their poker games. [...] Gates found he had an aptitude for the game and for anticipating the cards men held and how they would play them. [...] With the grain brokerage now forgotten, he was able to make up the losses at <b>the</b> <b>card</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
50|$|In this game, {{each player}} is dealt three cards, and five are dealt to the table. Players may trail or take <b>cards</b> from <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> {{if they have}} <b>cards</b> which match <b>the</b> <b>cards</b> on <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> or if they have two cards which {{add up to a}} <b>card</b> on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and equal <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>card's</b> value.

2500|$|Con men and grifters too may use {{techniques}} of conjuring for fraudulent goals. Cheating at card games {{is an obvious}} example, and not a surprising one: {{one of the most}} respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians, The Expert at <b>the</b> <b>Card</b> <b>Table</b> by Erdnase, was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps. The card trick known as [...] "Find the Lady" [...] or [...] "Three-card Monte" [...] is an old favourite of street hustlers, who lure the victim into betting on what seems like a simple proposition: to identify, after a seemingly easy-to-track mixing sequence, which one of three face-down cards is the Queen. Another example is the shell game, in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells, then shuffled around the table (or sidewalk) so slowly as to make the pea's position seemingly obvious. Although these are well known as frauds, people still lose money on them; a shell-game ring was broken up in Los Angeles as recently as December 2009.|$|E

A heap of notes and gold (won mainly from Romayne, as I {{afterward}} discovered) lay before him.

Such prediction requires not only analysis of the model and its dilemmas, but also exploration of the reality outside the model; without this it is impossible to decide which ways of changing the model in order to eliminate dilemmas might be rationalized by the characters.|$|R

[...] In 1977, the Ngoys took a trip to Las Vegas where Ted saw Elvis Presley at his last performance before his death. It was here that Ngoy had his first taste of gambling while placing bets at the Blackjack tables. Ngoy would make a habit of returning monthly to watch performers such as Tom Jones, Diana Ross and Wayne Newton and indulging in the incentives pit bosses of major casinos offered all the while spending even larger sums at <b>the</b> <b>card</b> <b>tables.</b> This caused tension in the Ngoy household, being the center of many arguments between Ngoy and his wife.

When he was unable to pay back his debt, he would sign over his store to them. Once a paragon in the community, refugees now avoided him for fear of being asked for a loan. Ngoy attempted Gambler's Anonymous, but denies its help with his situation stating that when he went to meetings [...] "I cry, everybody cry. After cry, go back gambling."
