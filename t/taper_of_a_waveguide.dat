40|$|<b>A</b> {{classical}} optics <b>waveguide</b> {{structure is}} proposed to simulate resonances of short range one-dimensional potentials in quantum mechanics. The analogy {{is based on}} the well known resemblance between the guided and radiation modes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>waveguide</b> with the bound and scattering states <b>of</b> <b>a</b> quantum well. As resonances are scattering states that spend some time in the zone of influence of the scatterer, we associate them with the leaky modes <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>waveguide,</b> the latter characterized by suffering attenuation in the direction of propagation but increasing exponentially in the transverse directions. The resemblance is complete since resonances (leaky modes) can be interpreted as bound states (guided modes) with definite lifetime (longitudinal shift). As an immediate application we calculate the leaky modes (resonances) associated with a dielectric homogeneous slab (square well potential) and show that these modes are attenuated as they propagate.
