40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work, {{to improve the}} press {{formability}} of {{the combination of the}} TRIP steel and ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel, the mechanical properties and press formability (stretch-formability) of YAG laser welded TRIP/DP tailored blanks were investigated. An as-cold-rolled sheet steel with the chemical composition of (0. 1 – 0. 3) C– 1. 5 Si– 1. 5 Mn (mass%) was used in this study. For comparison, 0. 14 C– 0. 22 Si– 1. 78 Mn (mass%) DP steel was also prepared. The quenched DP steel is called MDP 0, and the tempered MDP 0 steel is called MDP 4. For butt welding, the blank obtained after the heat treatment was cut using a fine cutter, and YAG laser processing equipment was used. The press formability was evaluated from the maximum stretch-height (Hmax). Tensile tests and stretch forming tests have been conducted for laser butt welded joints obtained from the combination of the different steel. The Hmax value of the MDP 0 steel was not controlled at the strength level of the DP steel, and was not different from the Hmax value of the MDP 4 steel. It is thought that this was assisted <b>to</b> <b>TRIP</b> <b>of</b> the TDP steel because the tensile strength of the TDP steel is consequentially lower than that of the MDP 0 steel. High ductility and the high stretch-formability were able to be secured by the high strength TRIP/DP tailored blanks. 1...|$|E

Several proposals are there to analyzing the sensitivity of different electrical equipment for voltage sag problem. They often lead <b>to</b> <b>tripping</b> <b>of</b> sensitive equipment like power drives, process-control, etc. This paper also calculated the losses in the different departments due to voltage sag having different severity and sensitivity...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe safe {{operation}} of electrical power systems {{is an ongoing}} problem. Despite the existing defense lines in the different electrical systems, they are not immune to widespread incidents leading <b>to</b> <b>tripping</b> <b>of</b> most consumers. In the defense plans against these major incidents, selective load shedding (LS) even optimized (but brutal), is the last resort before total blackout. This paper proposes a new concept of residential consumers “soft" load shedding (SLS). Its originality lies within {{the fact that it}} takes {{only a fraction of the}} consumers' power, even if the effort is spread over a larger number. It therefore seeks to avoid the plunge into darkness...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a variant on a pick-up and delivery problem with time windows, where both {{early and late}} delivery of items is penalized. This problem arises from an application {{in the area of}} defence, but has wider applications in delivery of perishable goods. We develop a heuristic for this problem- decomposing the problem into a higher level problem assigning items to be delivered <b>to</b> <b>trips</b> <b>of</b> vehicles (which we solve using tabu search) and a lower level problem choosing optimal delivery times for these trips (which we solve by an exact iterative approach). We compare this approach with an integer programming model. For quite small instances of the problem, the associated integer programming problem cannot be solved, but testing on small problems suggests the heuristic is a promising approach for finding good solutions. ...|$|R
