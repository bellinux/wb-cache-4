25|$|Note that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> between pool types. Indoor {{pools of}} 25 m give the {{advantage}} of being able to use the turning point to push off again using ones legs, thus giving a clear advantage over 50 m and of course open water venues. Open sea gives the really bad side effect of large waves and the tides, which will sometimes push the swimmer back to where they came from, this can be clearly seen in the differences in times between the Channel crossing and the almost double in length Maraton Acuatica Rio Coronda which she performed in two hours less.|$|E

Slovenia was {{in the beginning of}} 2007 the first new member to introduce the euro as its currency, replacing the tolar.

500|$|In {{the same}} paper, Serre {{found the first}} place that p-torsion occurs in the {{homotopy}} groups of n dimensional spheres, by showing that πn+k(S'n) has no p-torsion if k < 2p − 3, and has a unique subgroup of order p if n ≥ 3 and k = 2p − 3. [...] The case of 2-dimensional spheres is slightly different: the first p-torsion occurs for k = 2p − 3 + 1. In the case of odd torsion there are more precise results; in this case <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> between odd and even dimensional spheres. If p is an odd prime and n = 2i + 1, then elements of the p-component of πn+k(S'n) have order at most p'i [...] This is in some sense the best possible result, as these groups {{are known to have}} elements of this order for some values of k [...] Furthermore, the stable range can be extended in this case: if n is odd then the double suspension from πk(S'n) to πk+2(S'n+2) is an isomorphism of p-components if k < p(n + 1) − 3, and an epimorphism if equality holds [...] The p-torsion of the intermediate group πk+1(S'n+1) can be strictly larger.|$|E

2500|$|Immanuel Kant and his {{followers}} held that shame is heteronomous (comes from others); Bernard Williams and others have argued that shame can be autonomous (comes from oneself). Shame may carry the connotation of a response to something that is morally wrong whereas embarrassment is the response to something that is morally neutral but socially unacceptable. Another view of shame and embarrassment says that the two emotions lie on a continuum and only differ in intensity. Simply put: [...] A person who feels guilt is saying [...] "I did something bad.", while someone who feels shame is saying [...] "I am bad". [...] <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> between the two.|$|E
2500|$|Mind, in Buddhism, is also {{described}} as being [...] "space-like" [...] and [...] "illusion-like". Mind is space-like {{in the sense that}} it is not physically obstructive. It has no qualities which would prevent it from existing. In Mahayana Buddhism, mind is illusion-like {{in the sense that it}} is empty of inherent existence. This does not mean it does not exist, it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist, according to Buddhism. When the mind is itself cognized properly, without misperceiving its mode of existence, it appears to exist like an illusion. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>difference</b> however between being [...] "space and illusion" [...] and being [...] "space-like" [...] and [...] "illusion-like". Mind is not composed of space, it just shares some descriptive similarities to space. Mind is not an illusion, it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions.|$|E
