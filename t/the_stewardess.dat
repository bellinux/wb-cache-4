25|$|Five {{crew members}} {{escaped from the}} cockpit through a 14-by-10-inch clear vision panel, and two more through a gash in the {{fuselage}} in the crew compartment, the sole survivors of the accident. Holes were cut in the fuselage through which a stewardess and two passengers were removed, but the latter died before reaching a hospital, and <b>the</b> <b>stewardess</b> died later of her injuries. No {{attempt was made to}} use the emergency exits, and the main cabin door was jammed; at the inquiry a fire expert attached to the RAF stated that the door of the Constellation was the most difficult he had had to open in his 24-year firefighting career.|$|E
25|$|Ensuite, il a commencé à percuter des maisons. Tous les colis des marchandises qui étaient à bord ont fait {{mouvement}} vers l’avant de l’avion. J’ai aperçu à côté de moi un trou par lequel je suis sorti sans savoir comment, et je suis tombé sur une flaque d’eau sablonneuse. J’ai pu alors contempler les flammes de l’avion qui consumait. Il ne s’agissait pas d’un poids exagéré. C’est une simple défaillance mécanique.This translates loosely to the following:We {{had taken}} off after taxiing for three minutes. At once, I noted that the plane started to pitch. The effort of the pilot to right the plane remained vain. At {{this point in time}} <b>the</b> <b>stewardess</b> told me to put on my seat belt. At that time, the plane started to fly low and it struck a palm tree and lost a wing.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>stewardess</b> did {{not lose}} temper. She was used to such things. If Miss Pritty had capsized her intellect over the bed-clothes, <b>the</b> <b>stewardess</b> would only have smiled, and wiped {{it up with a}} napkin.|$|E

60|$|I {{had dropped}} upon my sofa--I felt faint. The man went on, liking to talk as persons {{of his class}} do when they have {{something}} horrible to tell. She usually rang for <b>the</b> <b>stewardess</b> early, but this morning of course {{there had been no}} ring. <b>The</b> <b>stewardess</b> had gone in all the same about eight o'clock and found the cabin empty. That was about an hour previous. Her things were there in confusion--the things she usually wore when she went above. <b>The</b> <b>stewardess</b> thought she had been a bit odd the night before, but had waited a little and then gone back. Miss Mavis hadn't turned up--and she didn't turn up. <b>The</b> <b>stewardess</b> began to look for her--she hadn't been seen on deck or in the saloon. Besides, she wasn't dressed--not to show herself; all her clothes were in her room. There was another lady, an old lady, Mrs. Nettlepoint--I would know her--that she was sometimes with, but <b>the</b> <b>stewardess</b> had been with her and knew Miss Mavis hadn't come near her that morning. She had spoken to him and they had taken a quiet look--they had hunted everywhere. A ship's a big place, but you did {{come to the end of}} it, and if a person wasn't there why there it was. In short an hour had passed and the young lady was not accounted for: from which I might judge if she ever would be. The watch couldn't account for her, but no doubt the fishes in the sea could--poor miserable pitiful lady! <b>The</b> <b>stewardess</b> and he had of course thought it their duty to speak at once to the Doctor, and the Doctor had spoken immediately to the Captain. The Captain didn't like it--they never did, but he'd try to keep it quiet--they always did.|$|E
6000|$|She stops abruptly, for Miss Pritty {{has gone}} into sudden convulsions, {{in the midst of}} which she begs <b>the</b> <b>stewardess,</b> quite fiercely, to [...] "Go away." ...|$|E
6000|$|But <b>the</b> <b>stewardess</b> {{would return}} in a moment. [...] "You'd better {{tell me what}} to call you," [...] he said quietly. [...] "I ought to know my niece's first name." ...|$|E

50|$|Originally from Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, she {{has acted}} in many popular movies such as <b>The</b> <b>Stewardesses</b> (1969), <b>The</b> Mad Bomber (1973) and Charley Varrick (1973).

6000|$|... "'Ave {{a cup of}} tea, ladies?" [...] said <b>the</b> <b>stewardess,</b> {{opening the}} door just then, and {{appearing}} at an acute angle with the doorway, holding a cup in each hand.|$|E
6000|$|And he knew {{also what}} <b>the</b> <b>stewardess</b> had seen: A lady in black {{with a white}} face {{standing}} in the middle of the empty ladies’ cabin. <b>The</b> <b>stewardess</b> induced her to lie down there. The lady seemed quite unwilling to speak, and as if she were in some awful trouble. The next <b>the</b> <b>stewardess</b> knew she was gone from the ladies’ cabin. <b>The</b> <b>stewardess</b> then went on deck to look for her, and Comrade Ossipon was informed that the good woman found the unhappy lady lying down in one of the hooded seats. Her eyes were open, but she would not answer anything that was said to her. She seemed very ill. <b>The</b> <b>stewardess</b> fetched the chief steward, and those two people stood by the side of the hooded seat consulting over their extraordinary and tragic passenger. They talked in audible whispers (for she seemed past hearing) of St Malo and the Consul there, of communicating with her people in England. Then they went away to arrange for her removal down below, for indeed by what they could see of her face she seemed to them to be dying. But Comrade Ossipon knew that behind that white mask of despair there was struggling against terror and despair a vigour of vitality, a love of life that could resist the furious anguish which drives to murder and the fear, the blind, mad fear of the gallows. He knew. But <b>the</b> <b>stewardess</b> and the chief steward knew nothing, except that when they came back for her in less than five minutes the lady in black was no longer in the hooded seat. She was nowhere. She was gone. It was then five o’clock in the morning, and it was no accident either. An hour afterwards one of the steamer’s hands found a wedding ring left lying on the seat. It had stuck to the wood in a bit of wet, and its glitter caught the man’s eye. There was a date, 24th June 1879, engraved inside. “An impenetrable mystery is destined to hang for ever. [...] . ” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess," [...] said Miss Maria, tranquilly, [...] "she's goin' to feel lonely {{enough at}} times, any way, poor thing! But I told {{her if she}} wanted advice or help about {{anything}} just to go to <b>the</b> <b>stewardess.</b> That Mrs. Bland that spent the summer at the Parkers' last year was always tellin' how they went to <b>the</b> <b>stewardess</b> for most everything, and she give her five dollars in gold when they got into Boston. I shouldn't want Lyddy should give so much as that, but I should want she should give something, as long's it's the custom." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1914 {{the ship}} was in Hamburg at the {{outbreak}} of the First World War and the crew were taken prisoner of war and detained until the end of hostilities. <b>The</b> <b>stewardesses</b> were released early in 1914 after representation of the Railway Company through the American Consul in Hamburg.|$|R
50|$|The two {{aforementioned}} pilots {{volunteer to}} repair the plane's tail and rudder. They come back inside the plane with severe injuries, and are covered with frost. This causes panic on board, but once again the captain manages to calm the situation, even asking one of <b>the</b> <b>stewardesses</b> to serve coffee as normal.|$|R
50|$|Bernard's life {{is turned}} upside down when his girlfriends' {{airlines}} begin putting new, state-of-the-art aircraft into service. These faster airplanes change all of the existing route schedules and allow <b>the</b> <b>stewardesses</b> {{to spend more time}} in Paris. Most alarming for Bernard, his three girlfriends will now all be in Paris at the same time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not just yet, honey," [...] said <b>the</b> <b>stewardess.</b> [...] "We're just in port." [...] Accordingly, {{in another}} {{quarter of an}} hour, a calm fell upon us all; and about midnight the voyage ended.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your steamer was shipwrecked," [...] said <b>the</b> <b>stewardess,</b> [...] "and a {{great many}} poor people were drowned, but you were saved in a boat. Look, there are your clothes; they were never in the water." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, nothing," [...] said Lydia. [...] "My aunt {{told me if}} any {{of these}} things should happen to want doing up, I had better get <b>the</b> <b>stewardess</b> to help me." [...] She looked at the boy in a dreadfully teasing way, softly biting her lip.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of those}} {{involved}} in the project also worked on a number of other films, such as the two leads, Alain Patrick, who worked on over 26 other film and television projects, such as Time Tunnel, Harry O, and Ironside; and, Barbara Caron (Barbara Mills), who performed in <b>The</b> <b>Stewardesses</b> and Executives' Wives, among her 38 other film projects.|$|R
2500|$|In their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films, Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser compare Perverted Criminal {{to later}} 3-D sex {{films such as}} <b>The</b> <b>Stewardesses</b> (1969), and {{describe}} Perverted Criminal as [...] "a considerably more violent and sleazy venture {{than any of the}} international 3-D erotica which followed". Allmovie also judges the film a [...] "gruesome affair" [...] and a [...] "sordid sleazefest".|$|R
50|$|Mori {{designed}} {{three consecutive}} uniforms for <b>the</b> <b>stewardesses</b> (flight attendants) of Japan Air Lines (JAL). The first uniform was worn from 1967 to 1970; the second, which created a sensation by featuring a miniskirt, worn from 1970 to 1977; {{and the third}} worn from 1977 to 1988. From 1989 to 1996, Mori employed Dominique Sirop as a designer. He became a grand couturier in 1997.|$|R
6000|$|This was not comforting, but I did {{not repeat}} it above. Mrs. Nettlepoint {{returned}} early to her cabin, professing herself much tired. I know not what 'went on,' but Grace Mavis continued not to show. I went in late, to bid Mrs. Nettlepoint good-night, and {{learned from her}} that the girl had not been to her. She had sent <b>the</b> <b>stewardess</b> to her room for news, {{to see if she}} were ill and needed assistance, and <b>the</b> <b>stewardess</b> came back with the information that she was not there. I went above after this; the night was not quite so fair and the deck was almost empty. In a moment Jasper Nettlepoint and our young lady moved past me together. 'I hope you are better!' I called after her; and she replied, over her shoulder-- ...|$|E
60|$|She {{answered}} that {{now he was}} teasing; that he was fundamentally incapable of taking anything seriously; {{and in the end}} he retired before <b>the</b> <b>stewardess</b> bringing her first coffee, with a well-merited feeling that {{if it had not been}} for his triviality the young Lancashireman would really have been Burnamy.|$|E
6000|$|... "In her state-room, I guess. She's 'most always sick on the ocean. I'm {{going to}} give <b>the</b> <b>stewardess</b> fifteen dollars for looking after her. I don't go down more 'n I can avoid. It makes me feel mysterious to pass that butler's-pantry place. Say, {{this is the first}} time I've been on the ocean." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1970, Stereovision, a new entity {{founded by}} director/inventor Allan Silliphant and optical {{designer}} Chris Condon, developed a different 35 mm single-strip format, which printed two images squeezed side-by-side and used an anamorphic lens {{to widen the}} pictures through Polaroid filters. Louis K. Sher (Sherpix) and Stereovision released the softcore sex comedy <b>The</b> <b>Stewardesses</b> (self-rated X, but later re-rated R by the MPAA). The film cost $100,000 USD to produce, and ran for months in several markets. eventually earning $27 million in North America, alone ($140 million in constant-2010 dollars) in fewer than 800 theaters, becoming the most profitable 3-Dimensional film to date, and in purely relative terms, {{one of the most}} profitable films ever.
