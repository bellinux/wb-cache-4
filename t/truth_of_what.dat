5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E

5|$|In December 2006, WildStorm began {{publishing}} its own {{series of}} comic books under the Friday the 13th title. The first set was a six-issue miniseries that involves Jason's return to Crystal Lake, a lone survivor's {{tale of the}} murder of her friends by a monster, a new revelation about the evil surrounding Crystal Lake, and the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Jason embodies. The miniseries pre‑sold approximately 60,318 copies altogether, with each issue pre‑selling 15,800, 9,600, 8,964, 8,637, 8,715, and 8,602 copies, respectively. The trade paperback of the series, released in September 2007, contained a foreword by musician Andrew W.K.. On July 11 and August 15, 2007, WildStorm published a two-part special titled Friday the 13th: Pamela's Tale. The two-issue comic book covers Pamela Voorhees' journey to Camp Crystal Lake and the story of her pregnancy with Jason as she recounts it to hitchhiker Annie, a camp counselor who is killed in the original film. The miniseries pre‑sold a combined 16,051 copies.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a story to tell if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E
5|$|Alucard {{appears in}} , {{a chapter of}} the Lords of Shadow reboot series. It is {{revealed}} that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, conceived before Gabriel {{was turned into a}} vampire and became the dark lord Dracula. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that his father Gabriel murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace to the land. After infiltrating the castle, Trevor successfully fights his way to the throne room, where he confronts Dracula without letting on that he is his son, or telling Dracula his name. Although Trevor puts up a valiant effort, in the end he is defeated and stabbed in the heart with his own Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate he finally realizes the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful and horrified for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula desperately tries to bring him back to life by giving him his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.|$|E

500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? I think its because people have spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} in the office, Arrington {{sponsored}} authors to write academic LDS Church histories. Among the best known works from this [...] "New Mormon History" [...] were two general Church histories, one aimed at LDS Church members, The Story of the Latter-day Saints, and one for interested outsiders, The Mormon Experience: A History of the Latter-day Saints. Arrington also granted liberal access to church archival material to both Mormon and non-Mormon scholars. Arrington continued to professionalize the archives with the systematic cataloging started by Joseph Fielding Smith. This era is sometimes referred to as [...] "Camelot" [...] due to its open and idealistic ethos. The division's output was not subject to the LDS Church's Correlation Program. The Correlation Program edited officially published church materials, like instruction manuals and magazines, to ensure that they presented a consistent message that LDS Church authorities agreed on. Arrington, Bitton, Allen, and Maureen Beecher served as a reading committee for the division's writings in place of formal Correlation approval. Arrington wanted to avoid the Correlation Program, stating that [...] "I do not think we could determine the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had happened in history by having the Quorum of the Twelve vote on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Anne {{was unable}} to walk between January and July 1713. At Christmas, she was feverish, and lay {{unconscious}} for hours, which led to rumours of her impending death. She recovered, but was seriously ill again in March. By July, Anne had lost confidence in Harley; his secretary recorded that Anne told the cabinet [...] "that he neglected all business; that he was seldom to be understood; that when he did explain himself, she could not depend upon the <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he said; that he never came {{to her at the}} time she appointed; that he often came drunk; [...] last, to crown all, he behaved himself towards her with ill manner, indecency and disrespect." [...] On 27 July 1714, during Parliament's summer recess, she dismissed Harley as Lord Treasurer. Despite failing health, which her doctors blamed on the emotional strain of matters of state, she attended two late-night cabinet meetings that failed to determine Harley's successor. A third meeting was cancelled when she became too ill to attend. She was rendered unable to speak by a stroke on 30 July 1714, the anniversary of Gloucester's death, and on the advice of the Privy Council handed the treasurer's staff of office to Whig grandee Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury. She died around 7:30a.m. on 1 August 1714. John Arbuthnot, one of her doctors, thought her death was a release from a life of ill-health and tragedy; he wrote to Jonathan Swift, [...] "I believe sleep was never more welcome to a weary traveller than death was to her." ...|$|E

[...] She also wrote that given who their parents are, [...] "that can only mean trouble". Fenmore has dated Summer, to which Ehrich stated: [...] "Everything he does is for his love for Summer. He has this obsession with her. Every action he does stems from that." [...] In another interview, he stated of their relationship: [...] "I think Fen’s first love is Summer; he falls in love; he’s infatuated with her. She plays games with him, and where it’s going is – will Fen get into her ways, or will he stand his ground? Everything Fenmore does is coming from his love for Summer, so he’s still the same kid, it’s just sometimes love makes you do some crazy thing Fenmore later began to enter a rebellious phase." [...] Tracey Bregman (who portrays his mother Lauren) stated that she [...] "was always hoping they would show the dark side of our child, because both Lauren and Michael have dark sides. That is something they both work hard on to suppress, that comes out now and them."

It’s going to be really fascinating. The whole family gets drawn in. The trouble with Fenmore affects Lauren and Michael. [...] rippling effect, like every good story." [...] The character was later involved in a cyberbullying storyline with Summer and Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo). Michael Logan of TV Guide previewed the storyline, writing: [...] "Adding fuel to the fire is young Fen Baldwin (Max Ehrich), who is so infatuated with Summer that he becomes her partner in crime — in fact, he takes things a few dangerous steps further once he sees Summer's growing fondness for Jamie." [...] Ehrich liked the plot as he was bullied as a child, stating: [...] "Kids do it out of their own sadness or insecurity, but needless to say that doesn’t matter when you’re a victim of it - you feel so isolated and so alone.
