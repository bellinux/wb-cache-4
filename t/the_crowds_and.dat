5|$|The {{successful}} crossing {{was greeted}} with enthusiastic cheers, the tunes of the Young Australian Band, the Albion Brass Band and Cooper and Bailey's International Show Band, who had all come to entertain <b>the</b> <b>crowds,</b> <b>and</b> the shrilling of the steamers' whistles. L'Estrange soon reappeared in a small row boat to greet the crowds, although many had already rushed the steamers to leave, resulting in a few being jostled into the harbour.|$|E
5|$|At her Silver Jubilee in 1977, <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> {{celebrations}} were genuinely enthusiastic, {{but in the}} 1980s, {{public criticism}} {{of the royal family}} increased, as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny. Elizabeth's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income tax for the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public. Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, though Elizabeth's personal popularity and support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.|$|E
5|$|The Kentish rebels had {{assembled}} a wide-ranging {{list of people}} whom they wanted the King to hand over for execution. It included national figures, such as John of Gaunt, Archbishop Sudbury and Hales; other {{key members of the}} royal council; officials, such as Belknap and Bampton who had intervened in Kent; and other hated members of the wider royal circle. When they reached the Marshalsea Prison in Southwark, they tore it apart. By now the Kent and Essex rebels had been joined by many rebellious Londoners. The Fleet and Newgate Prisons were attacked by <b>the</b> <b>crowds,</b> <b>and</b> the rebels also targeted houses belonging to Flemish immigrants.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the psychology of <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> {{its impact on the}} individual. The main aim of this work is to understand the general characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> to apply this knowledge to <b>the</b> shopping <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> determine <b>the</b> factors that influence an individual in <b>the</b> shopping <b>crowd</b> <b>the</b> most. The thesis is divided into theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part illustrates the characteristics of collective behavior <b>and</b> of <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> factors influencing <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> in general terms and in terms of <b>the</b> shopping <b>crowd.</b> <b>The</b> practical part is focused on <b>the</b> shopping <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> is composed of two parts. The first part contains a survey dealing with the mob behavior when purchasing, and its evaluation. The questionnaire of both genders and all age groups was used as a main part of survey. The second part based on outcomes of the theoretical part, survey and data from the media sets the factors influencing the behavior of <b>the</b> shopping <b>crowd.</b> <b>The</b> analysis concludes with a comprehensive evaluation of the thesis...|$|R

25|$|The protesters {{continued}} east along 17th Street {{into the}} 17th Street Commercial District in Oaksterdam, crossing Broadway and Franklin, where rioters broke numerous storefront windows, and continued {{back into the}} Lakeside District, lighting discarded christmas trees on fire.

25|$|Between 2007 and 2011 the Wiltshire town of Wootton Bassett was {{host to the}} repatriations {{of fallen}} service {{men and women who}} died in Afghanistan and Iraq.

25|$|The next summer, {{the most}} {{influential}} white band in the United States during the early 1930s, the Casa Loma Orchestra, drew in <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> ushered in the Big Band Era for the casino. The performances at the Glen Island Casino were being heard nationwide. Situated on the Long Island Sound, the casino's enormous ballroom was acoustically ideal for the crystal-clear radio transmissions.|$|E
25|$|During this period, {{dissident}} {{newspapers were}} freely publishing, fighting-peacock banners were unfurled, synchronised marches were held and rally speakers were protected. In Rangoon, {{the first signs}} of the movement began around the Buddhist full moon of Waso at the Shwedagon Pagoda when student demonstrators emerged demanding support for the demonstrations. Neighbourhood and strike committees barricaded and defended neighbourhoods and mobilised further demonstrations. In some areas, committees built makeshift stages where speakers addressed <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> brought donations to support rallies.|$|E

25|$|The Buddhists {{pushed for}} a five-point agreement: freedom to fly {{religious}} flags, an end to arbitrary arrests, compensation for the Huế victims, punishment for the officials responsible and religious equality. Diệm then banned demonstrations, and ordered his forces to arrest those who engaged in civil disobedience. On 3 June 1963, protesters attempted to march towards the Từ Đàm pagoda. Six waves of ARVN tear gas and attack dogs failed to disperse <b>the</b> <b>crowds,</b> <b>and</b> finally brownish-red liquid chemicals were doused on praying protesters, resulting in 67 being hospitalised for chemical injuries. A curfew was subsequently enacted.|$|E
25|$|In 1840, the Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale was {{commissioned}} {{to celebrate the}} tenth anniversary of the July Revolution of 1830. Owing to a strict deadline, it was performed only days after it was completed. The performance {{was held in the}} open air on 28 July, conducted by Berlioz himself, at the Place de la Bastille. The piece was difficult to hear owing to <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> timpani of the drum corps. This was later remedied by a concert performance a month later, and Wagner voiced his approval of the work. The following year he began but later abandoned the composition of a new opera, La nonne sanglante; some fragments survive.|$|E
25|$|In 393, Theodosius (r. 379–395) adopted Nicene Christianity as {{the state}} church of the Roman Empire and banned pagan festivals. The ludi continued, very {{gradually}} shorn of their stubbornly pagan munera. Honorius (r. 395–423) legally ended munera in 399, and again in 404, {{at least in the}} Western half of the Empire. According to Theodoret, the ban was in consequence of Saint Telemachus martyrdom by spectators at a munus. Valentinian III (r. 425–455) repeated the ban in 438, perhaps effectively, though venationes continued beyond 536. By this time, interest in munera had waned throughout the Roman world. In the Eastern Empire, theatrical shows and chariot races continued to attract <b>the</b> <b>crowds,</b> <b>and</b> drew a generous Imperial subsidy.|$|E
5|$|In the morning, {{attention}} focused on the capital Saigon, where approximately 500 Buddhist laypeople, mostly youths, protested {{in front of the}} Government Delegate's office while 300 troops stood by. <b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> a government official equipped with a loudspeaker exchanged taunts and accusations. When the official claimed that Vietcong were among <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> attempting to cause trouble, the troops aimed their firearms at the protestors.|$|R
50|$|The {{reaction}} was generally one of being heckled by <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> <b>and</b> press censure, bordering on derision.|$|R

25|$|On 9 May 1945, , {{which had}} set out from Plymouth, arrived in Jersey to accept the {{surrender}} of the occupying forces. Two naval officers, Surgeon Lieutenant Ronald McDonald and Sub Lieutenant R Milne, were met by the Harbour Master who escorted them to the Harbour Master's Office where they together hoisted the Union Flag, before also raising it on the flagstaff of the Pomme D'Or Hotel. This has been re-enacted every year on Liberation Day since 1995. From 2003 to 2011 Harbour Master and Jerseyman Captain Howard Le Cornu performed this annually. His father John E. Le Cornu and uncle David M. Le Cornu had been in <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> had witnessed the occasion on 9 May 1945.|$|E
25|$|Upon this, {{there was}} a clamour among <b>the</b> <b>crowds,</b> <b>and</b> Mirza Ghulam Ahmad was {{informed}} that the other party alleged {{that he was at}} odds with Islamic beliefs and was a disbeliever; therefore, it was not proper to debate with him unless he clarified his beliefs. Ghulam Ahmad wrote his beliefs {{on a piece of paper}} and had it read aloud, but due to the clamour among the people, it could not be heard. Seeing that the crowd was drifting out of control and that violence was imminent, the police superintendent gave orders to disperse the audience, and the debate did not take place. A few days later, however, a written debate did take place between Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and Maulwi Muhammad Bashir of Bhopal, which was later published.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{learning}} of the capture of the royal family, the National Constituent Assembly sent three representatives, Antoine Barnave, Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve and Charles César de Fay de La Tour-Maubourg to Varennes to escort Marie Antoinette and her family back to Paris. On {{the way to the}} capital they were jeered and insulted by the people as never before. The prestige of the French monarchy had never been at such a low level. During the trip, Barnave, the representative of the moderate party in the Assembly, protected Marie Antoinette from <b>the</b> <b>crowds,</b> <b>and</b> even Pétion took pity on the royal family. Brought safely back to Paris, they were met with total silence by the crowd. Thanks to Barnave, the royal couple was not brought to trial and was publicly exonerated of any crime in relation with the attempted escape.|$|E

25|$|In 1970, Burr {{took on a}} {{different}} kind of role, as Bacchus II, king of the Mardi Gras Krewe of the same name in New Orleans, Louisiana. Bacchus' parade rolls through the streets of New Orleans on the Sunday night before Mardi Gras Day. Burr threw the traditional beads and doubloons to <b>the</b> <b>crowds,</b> <b>and</b> following the parade he reigned at the Krewe's annual invitation-only ball (Bacchus calls it their Rendezvous) at the Rivergate Convention Center in downtown New Orleans. There, an invited crowd of over 10,000 greeted King Bacchus II {{and the rest of the}} parade as it rolled within the Center, with Burr again throwing more beads and doubloons. The festivities of that day began in the wee hours of the morning and continued to the end of the Ball, around 5 am the next morning.|$|E
25|$|Wilson's {{remarriage}} rejuvenated {{his personal}} aspirations for re-election. Edith Wilson enjoyed, as Ellen never had, <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> the {{power as a}} close collaborator with her husband. Executive decisions {{just prior to the}} campaign also enabled Wilson to bolster his political mastery. He was presented with a vacancy on the Supreme Court, which he succeeded in filling with a controversial nominee, Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish member of the court. Also, in the summer of 1916 the nation's economy was endangered by a railroad strike. The president called the parties to a White House summit in August—after two days and no results, Wilson proceeded to settle the issue, using the maximum eight-hour work day as the linchpin. Once the Congress passed the Adamson bill incorporating the president's proposal, the strike was cancelled. Wilson was praised for averting a national economic disaster, though the law was received with howls from conservatives denouncing a sellout to the unions and a surrender by Congress to an imperious president.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the end of}} that year, the Iorgas were in the Austro-Hungarian city of Budapest. While there, the {{historian}} set up tight contacts with Romanian intellectuals who originated from Transylvania and who, {{in the wake of the}} Transylvanian Memorandum affair, supported ethnic nationalism while objecting to the intermediary Cisleithanian (Hungarian Crown) rule and the threat of Magyarization. Interested in recovering the Romanian contributions to Transylvanian history, in particular Michael the Brave's precursory role in Romanian unionism, Iorga spent his time reviewing, copying and translating Hungarian-language historical texts with much assistance from his wife. During the 300th commemoration of Prince Michael's death, which ethnic Romanian students transformed into a rally against Austro-Hungarian educational restrictions, Iorga addressed <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> was openly greeted by the protest's leaders, poet Octavian Goga and Orthodox priest Ioan Lupaș. In 1902, he published new tracts on Transylvanian or Wallachian topics: Legăturile Principatelor române cu Ardealul ("The Romanian Principalities' Links with Transylvania"), Sate și preoți din Ardeal ("Priests and Villages of Transylvania"), Despre Cantacuzini ("On the Cantacuzinos"), Istoriile domnilor Țării Românești ("The Histories of Wallachian Princes").|$|E
