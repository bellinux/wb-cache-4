5|$|This {{decision}} {{may cause}} regret in some men and women. Of women aged over 30 who have undergone tubal ligation, about 5% regret their decision, {{as compared with}} 20% of women aged under 30. By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage. In a survey of biological parents, 9% stated {{they would not have}} had children if they were able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> again.|$|E
25|$|Like other intelligentsia, Christian {{leaders were}} {{sometimes}} persecuted for their anti-Nazi political activities. Between 1939 and 1945, an estimated 3,000 members, 18% of the Polish clergy, were murdered for their suspected {{ties to the}} Polish Resistance or left-wing groups, or for sheltering Jews (punishable by death). Outside mainstream Christianity, Jehovah's Witnesses were targets of Nazi Persecution, for their refusal to swear allegiance to the Nazi government. Many Jehovah's Witnesses were {{given the chance to}} swear allegiance to the state, but few agreed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Over</b> 12,000 Jehovah's Witnesses were sent to concentration camps, and an estimated 2,500–5,000 died.|$|E
25|$|With no {{two-point}} conversion option (that {{would not}} be adopted by the league until 1993), Cleveland needed two scores to come back. Pagel led the Browns 71 yards to score on his 2-yard touchdown pass to Slaughter, cutting the score to 24–23 with 31 seconds left. Cleveland attempted an onside kick, which they failed to recover, but got another chance due to an Oilers penalty. Then the Browns recovered, but had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> again due to a penalty against them. Finally on the third try, Cleveland was penalized for touching the ball before it went 10 yards, resulting in a penalty that gave Houston the ball and the win.|$|E

500|$|Completing {{the main}} cast, Patrick Wymark stars as Jason Webb, {{director}} of EUROSEC. Having selected {{him on the}} basis of his performance as John Wilder in the television series The Plane Makers (1963–65) and The Power Game (1965–70), Anderson stated that Wymark's acting impressed him as much as Hendry's, but also that his similar drinking habits resulted in slurred lines on set. During the filming of one scene, Wymark [...] "had to list these explanations... and on take after take he couldn't remember that 'two' followed 'one'. We had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> and over again." [...] Archer and Hearn identify Wymark's portrayal of Webb, a character described as [...] "John Wilder (2069 model)" [...] in publicity material, as the dominant performance of the film. The draft script describes Webb as a former British Minister of Technology, who is now romantically involved with his secretary, Pam Kirby.|$|E
2500|$|The {{storming}} of Nam O Beach {{took place}} on 8 March 1965 on the coastline around the port of Da Nang in South Vietnam. In the few days preceding the landing, Karch commented that the weather was the worst that he had experienced. When inhabitants of the friendly beach greeted the arriving Marines and photographs were taken, Karch was never seen to smile. When this was queried, he replied [...] "...if I had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>over,</b> that picture {{would have been the}} same. When you have a son in Vietnam and he gets killed, you don't want a smiling general with flowers around his neck as leader at that point." ...|$|E
2500|$|Game Revolution's Duke Ferris {{scored the}} game a B+, praising the graphics, but criticizing the {{difficulty}} level, writing [...] "you have unlimited lives in MDK2, {{and it is}} a strictly linear game with fixed checkpoints. This means that when you get to a hard section, your only choice is <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> and over again until you get to the next checkpoint. After playing the exact same level for the 30th time, this can get frustrating." [...] However, he concluded, [...] "the non-frustrating times in MDK 2 are simply tons of fun. The game is genuinely funny, has great voices and a terrific comic book flair." ...|$|E

If I had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> again, it would be a simple house burglary." [...] Speck's [...] "final thought for the American people" [...] was, [...] "Just tell 'em to keep up their hatred for me. I know it keeps up their morale. And I don't know what I'd do without it." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the Leafs {{falling out}} of playoff {{contention}} once more {{towards the end of}} the season and Sundin's contract set to expire, Sundin was the focus of numerous trade rumours as the 26 February NHL trade deadline approached. Maple Leafs management requested that Sundin waive his no-trade clause in order for the team to acquire potential young talent and/or draft picks to secure the team's future. [...] On 25 February, however, he stated that he would not waive his no-trade clause, stating that he did not believe in being a [...] "rental player" [...] and that if he won the Stanley Cup, he wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> the course of an entire season. [...] He remained with the club and, with 78 points, marked the fourth consecutive year and 12 of 13 years as the Maple Leafs' leading scorer.|$|E

5000|$|The album {{title and}} {{title of the}} title track is a quote often {{attributed}} to Spike Milligan but equally possibly deriving from a bootlegged Bob Dylan song [...] "All Over You" [...] ("Well, if I had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all <b>over</b> again/Babe, I’d <b>do</b> <b>it</b> all <b>over</b> you") The cover was shot in Holland Park, London and was photographed by David Jupe.|$|R

60|$|They led {{her up to}} {{the table}} amid {{laughing}} and joking and she put her hand out in the air as she was told to do. She moved her hand about here and there in the air and descended on one of the saucers. She felt a soft wet substance with her fingers and was surprised that nobody spoke or took off her bandage. There was a pause for a few seconds; and then a great deal of scuffling and whispering. Somebody said something about the garden, and at last Mrs. Donnelly said something very cross to one of the next-door girls and told her to throw it out at once: that was no play. Maria understood that it was wrong that time and so she had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> again: and this time she got the prayer-book.|$|E
