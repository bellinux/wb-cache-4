500|$|... {{consider}} {{a model of}} classroom scheduling [...] in which a set of n <b>teachers</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> scheduled to teach each of m cohorts of students. The number of hours per week that teacher i spends with cohort j is described by entry Rij of a matrix R given as input to the problem, and each teacher also has a set of hours during {{which he or she}} is available to be scheduled. As they show, the problem is NP-complete, even when each teacher has at most three available hours, but it can be solved as an instance of 2-satisfiability when each teacher only has two available hours. (Teachers with only a single available hour may easily be eliminated from the problem.) In this problem, each variable vij corresponds to an hour that teacher i must spend with cohort j, the assignment to the variable specifies whether that hour is the first or the second of the teacher's available hours, and there is a 2-satisfiability clause preventing any conflict of either of two types: two cohorts assigned to a teacher {{at the same time as}} each other, or one cohort assigned to two teachers at the same time.|$|E

2500|$|It is essential, {{according}} to Dewey, that {{the classroom teacher}} has the mental propensity to overcome the demands and stressors placed on her because the students can sense when their teacher is not genuinely invested in promoting their learning (Dewey, PST, 2010). [...] Such negative demeanors, {{according to}} Dewey, prevent children from pursuing their own propensities for learning and intellectual growth. [...] It can therefore be assumed that if teachers want their students to engage with the educational process and employ their natural curiosities for knowledge, <b>teachers</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> aware of how their reactions to young children and the stresses of teaching influence this process.|$|E

5000|$|If {{a student}} {{has been well}} educated {{in a wide variety}} of subjects, the <b>teacher</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> careful not to repeat what they have already learned, but to {{challenge}} the student with material which they do not yet know thoroughly. With the student who has had no education, the <b>teacher</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> patient, willing to repeat things until the student understands, and sympathetic. Perhaps the most difficult student, however, is the one with an inferior education who believes he understands something when he does not. Augustine stressed the importance of showing this type of student the difference between [...] "having words and having understanding" [...] and of helping the student to remain humble with his acquisition of knowledge.|$|R
