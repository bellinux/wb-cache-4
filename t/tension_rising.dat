40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of maximum elbow flexor strength exerted during different respiratory phases. Twelve healthy male subjects, aged from 18 to 22 years, participated. Each subjects was asked to exert his maximum elbow flexor strength in holding the elbow joint at right angle under the 4 different conditions (expiring, inspiring, breath holding and shouting). The EMG activities of m. biceps brachii and m. triceps brachii were recorded with bipolar surface electrodes. The respiratory phase and the sound of shouting were recorded with a themistor and microphone, respectively. The fo 1 lowing results were obtained: 1) The peak value for maximum strength increased in the order expiring, inspiring, breath holding and shouting. The relative values based on the peak value for breath holding were 92. 02 %, 92. 34 %, 104. 25 % in right elbow flexing and 94. 68 %, 96. 71 %, 108. 43 % in light elbow flexing, respectively. 2) The correlations of the peak value for maximum strength in the various respiratory phases were significant. 3) The rate of <b>tension</b> <b>rise</b> increased in the order expiring, inspiring, breath holding and shouting. The relative values based on the rate of <b>tension</b> <b>rise</b> for breath holding were 72. 97 %, 72. 93 %, 195. 03 % in right elbow flexing and 81. 64 %, 74. 75 %, 184. 11 % in left elbow flexing, respectively. 4) Positively significant correlations in the rate of <b>tension</b> <b>rise</b> were found among the various respiration phases. 5) The correlations between the peak value for maximum strength and the rate of <b>tension</b> <b>rise</b> in each respiratory phase were positively significant. These results suggest that the effect of the respiratory phase on the rate of <b>tension</b> <b>rise</b> was significantly greater than on the peak value for maximum strength...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} the tension responses to ramp shortening and rapid temperature jump (< 0. 2 ms, 3 – 4 °C T-jump) in maximally Ca 2 +-activated rabbit psoas muscle fibres at 8 – 9 °C (the fibre length (L 0) was ∼ 1. 5 mm and sarcomere length 2. 5 μm). The {{aim was to}} investigate the strain sensitivity of crossbridge force generation in muscle. The T-jump induced <b>tension</b> <b>rise</b> was examined during steady shortening over a wide range of velocities (V) approaching the Vmax (V range ∼ 0. 01 to ∼ 1. 5 L 0 s− 1). In the isometric state, a T-jump induced a biphasic <b>tension</b> <b>rise</b> consisting of a fast (∼ 50 s− 1, phase 2 b) and a slow (∼ 10 s− 1, phase 3) component, but if treated as monophasic the rate was ∼ 20 s− 1. During steady shortening the T-jump <b>tension</b> <b>rise</b> was monophasic; the rate of <b>tension</b> <b>rise</b> increased linearly with shortening velocity, and near Vmax it was ∼ 200 s− 1, ∼ 10 × faster than in the isometric state. Relative to the tension reached after the T-jump, the amplitude increased with shortening velocity, and near Vmax it was ∼ 4 × larger than in the isometric state. Thus, the temperature sensitivity of muscle force is markedly increased with velocity during steady shortening, as found in steady state experiments. The rate of tension decline during ramp shortening also increased markedly with increase of velocity. The absolute amplitude of T-jump <b>tension</b> <b>rise</b> was larger than that in the isometric state at the low velocities (< 0. 5 L 0 s− 1) but decreased to below that of the isometric state at the higher velocities. Such a biphasic velocity dependence of the absolute amplitude of T-jump <b>tension</b> <b>rise</b> implies interplay between, at least, two processes that have opposing effects on the tension output as the shortening velocity is increased, probably enhancement of crossbridge force generation and faster (post-stroke) crossbridge detachment by negative strain. Overall, our results show that T-jump force generation is strain sensitive and becomes considerably faster when exposed to negative strain. Thus the crossbridge force generation step in muscle is both temperature sensitive (endothermic) and strain sensitive...|$|R

50|$|Runciman {{returned}} to public life when, {{at the beginning}} of August 1938, the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, sent him on a Mission to Czechoslovakia to mediate in a dispute between the Government of Czechoslovakia and the Sudeten German Party (SdP), representing the ethnic German population of the border regions known as the Sudetenland. Unknown to Runciman, the SdP, although ostensibly calling for autonomy for the Sudetenland, had instructions from Nazi Germany not to reach any agreement on the matter so the attempts at mediation failed. With international <b>tension</b> <b>rising</b> in Central Europe, Runciman was recalled to London on 16 September 1938. The controversial report on his Mission provided support for British policy towards Czechoslovakia, culminating in the dismembering of the country {{under the terms of the}} Munich Agreement. Further controversy arose from Runciman's use of his leisure time in Czechoslovakia spent mostly in the company of Hitler's Jewish spy and erstwhile lover of Lord Rothermere, Princess Stephanie Julianne von Hohenlohe and the pro-SdP aristocracy.|$|E

5000|$|The A.V. Club gave it an A, writing: [...] "The {{genius of}} Black Mirror is how subtly it builds, keeping you from ever {{questioning}} the insanity of the premise or any minor plothole. Every twist seems organic, every decision rational. Every effort {{is made to}} find the kidnapper, of course, but that necessarily has to fail. The press initially struggles with how to report on such an insane story sensitively, but its hand is forced by social media and the ineffable power of the internet." [...] The Telegraph rated it four out of five, commenting: [...] "Virgin territory indeed. This was a dementedly brilliant idea. The satire was so audacious, it left me open-mouthed and squealing. Rather like that poor pig." [...] The Independent said: [...] "This carefully crafted and compact drama is engrossing, with the <b>tension</b> <b>rising</b> by degrees as the time moves ever closer for the PM to meet the kidnapper's demands. It comes across as being anti-Twitter but {{also serves as a}} cautionary tale about the power of the collective 'hive mind' that is social media.

[...] The Guardian wrote: [...] "To the untrained eye, the first of Black Mirror, National Anthem, looked suspiciously like political satire - and a very superior one - rather than a sci-fi vision of technology's power to distort the world. All the gadgetry seemed only too familiar and the voyeurism all too credible: there's more dystopia in an episode of Spooks." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{cardiopulmonary}} {{effects of}} a ketamine/ acepromazine combination was studied in ten cats subjected to a 25 % whole blood volume loss. Test parameters included cardiac output, measured via thermodilution, heart rate, respiratory rate, arterial blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and mean) and blood gas analysis. Values for cardiac index, stroke volume and systemic vascular resistance were calculated from these data. Posthemorrhage, cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, heart rate and measurements of arterial blood pressure were significantly decreased (p less than 0. 05). Following the induction of ketamine/ acepromazine anesthesia, cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume and heart rate showed mild but statistically insignificant declines and were above their respective posthemorrhage values 120 min into ketamine/ acepromazine anesthesia. Measurements of arterial blood pressure showed further declines from their respective posthemorrhage values that were statistically significant (p less than 0. 05). Following hemorrhage, respiratory rate increased significantly (p less than 0. 05), associated with a fall in arterial CO 2 tension. During ketamine/ acepromazine anesthesia, respiratory rate showed a dramatic and significant decline (p less than 0. 05) with arterial CO 2 <b>tension</b> <b>rising</b> to prehemorrhage values.
