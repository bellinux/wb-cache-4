500|$|Disappointed by {{the lack}} of {{progress}} on the film's production, aspiring screenwriter/comic book fan Alex Ford was able to have a script of his (titled Superman: The Man of Steel) accepted at the studio's offices in September 1998. Ford pitched his idea for a film series consisting of seven installments, and his approach impressed Warner Bros. and Peters, though he was later given a farewell due to creative differences. Ford said, [...] "I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>they</b> don't know much about comics. Their audience isn't you and me who pay $7.00. It's for the parents who spend $60 on toys and lunchboxes. It is a business, and what's more important, the $150 million at the box office or the $600 million in merchandising?" ...|$|E
500|$|Many of Potter's tales {{appealed to}} girls, but Mr. Tod {{had a strong}} {{following}} among boys, due perhaps to the lengthy fight {{at the end of}} the book accompanied by [...] "dreadful bad language". Six-year-old Harold Botcherby wrote to Potter asking if the fight between Tod and Brock was still raging. Potter replied; describing the end of the battle and the injuries to the combatants:I am sorry to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>they</b> are still quarreling. Mr. Tod has been living in the willow till he was flooded out; at present he is in the stick house with a bad cold in his head. As for the end of the fight [...] Mr. Tod had nearly half his hair pulled out of his brush [...] and five bad bites, especially one ear, which is scrumpled up (like you sometimes see nasty old Tom Cat's ears). the only misfortune to Tommy Brock [...] he had his jacket torn and lost one of his boots. So for a long time he went about with one of his feet bundled up in dirty rags, like an old beggar man. Then he found the boot in the quarry. There was a beetle in the boot and several slugs. Tommy Brock ate them. He is a nasty person. He will go on living in Mr. Tod's comfortable house till springtime [...] then he will move off into the woods & live out doors [...] and Mr. Tod will come back very, very cautiously [...] & there will need to be a big spring cleaning!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 5 January 1990, {{addressing}} Conservatives in Liverpool, Powell {{claimed that}} if the Conservatives played the [...] "British card" [...] at the next general election, they could win; the new mood in Britain for [...] "self-determination" [...] had given the newly independent nations of Eastern Europe a [...] "beacon", adding that Britain should stand alone, if necessary, for European freedom, adding: [...] "We are taunted—by the French, by the Italians, by the Spaniards—for refusing to worship at the shrine of a common government superimposed upon them all... where were the European unity merchants in 1940? I will <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>They</b> were either writhing under a hideous oppression or they were aiding and abetting that oppression. Lucky for Europe that Britain was alone in 1940".|$|E

6000|$|... “You {{stare at}} them all alike,” Littlemore went on, still without moving; “except indeed when I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>they</b> aren’t decent—then your eyes, my dear man, grow {{as large as}} saucers.” ...|$|E
