5|$|The video {{introduces}} a sober, contemplative side of Madonna, revealing a mature mysticism. It {{begins with the}} camera skimming along a cracked, desiccated desert floor, and within seconds Madonna appears, hovering just above {{the ground in the}} distance. Her hands are covered with mehndi and an enigmatic symbol on one palm. In the video she slowly gestures and sways her arms toward the sky in the video, desperately pleading to her cold lover cited in the song. At one point Madonna falls, and as she hits the ground, she transforms into a flock of large, dark birds. Later, she transforms into a black dog. Three Madonnas also appear walking and crawling amid the desert throughout the video. As the song progresses, the sky darkens, and Madonna levitates from the ground. Her form then changes to a shiny black liquid, which runs along <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> <b>floor</b> and appears to be absorbed by the tattooed hands of another Madonna, who is curled up on the crenellated ground. The video ends with a desperate and melancholy Madonna.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{are formed}} by {{weathering}} processes as large {{variations in temperature}} between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> <b>floor</b> is further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert pavements and little further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground sources {{of water in the}} form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur.|$|E

5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> <b>floor,</b> remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the sentinel bird sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E

5|$|Deserts {{present a}} very {{challenging}} environment for animals. Not {{only do they}} require food and water but {{they also need to}} keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most able to do this of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from <b>the</b> over-heated <b>desert</b> <b>floor</b> by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The sandgrouse is an expert at this and nests on <b>the</b> open <b>desert</b> <b>floor</b> dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. <b>The</b> <b>desert</b> lark takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> Sonoran <b>Desert</b> {{there are}} many closely related species of heteromyid mice and rats. Each has its own niche in the {{environment}} {{which means that they}} do not unnecessarily compete with each other for the limited available resources. Bailey's pocket mouse climbs into plants and bushes in order to find seeds and berries still attached to the plant. It is the only species able to eat the wax found inside the seeds of the jojoba plant. <b>The</b> <b>desert</b> pocket mouse forages across <b>the</b> open <b>desert</b> <b>floor</b> and gathers seeds that have fallen to the ground.|$|R
500|$|Sandstorms {{occur with}} much less {{frequency}} than dust storms. They are often preceded by severe dust storms and {{occur when the}} wind velocity increases {{to a point where}} it can lift heavier particles. These grains of sand, up to about [...] in diameter are jerked into the air but soon fall back to earth, ejecting other particles in the process. Their weight prevents them from being airborne for long and most only travel a distance of a few meters (yards). The sand streams along above the surface of the ground like a fluid, often rising to heights of about [...] In a really severe steady blow, [...] is about as high as the sand stream can rise as the largest sand grains do not become airborne at all.

500|$|Gust fronts create {{low-level}} {{wind shear}} {{which can be}} hazardous to planes when they takeoff or land. [...] Flying insects are swept along by the prevailing winds. [...] As such, fine line patterns within weather radar imagery, associated with converging winds, are dominated by insect returns. [...] At the surface, clouds of dust can be raised by outflow boundaries. If squall lines form over arid regions, a duststorm known as a haboob can result from the high winds picking up dust in their wake from <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> <b>floor.</b> [...] If outflow boundaries move into areas of the atmosphere which are stable in the low levels, such as over colder pockets of ocean or through the cold sector of extratropical cyclones, they can create a phenomenon known as an undular bore, which shows up on satellite and radar imagery {{as a series of}} transverse waves in the cloud field oriented perpendicular to the low-level winds.|$|E

500|$|Some desert plants produce seed {{which lies}} dormant {{in the soil}} until sparked into growth by rainfall. When annuals, such plants grow with great rapidity and may flower and set seed within weeks, aiming to {{complete}} their development before the last vestige of water dries up. For perennial plants, reproduction {{is more likely to}} be successful if the seed germinates in a shaded position, but not so close to the parent plant as to be in competition with it. Some seed will not germinate until it has been blown about on <b>the</b> <b>desert</b> <b>floor</b> to scarify the seed coat. The seed of the mesquite tree, which grows in deserts in the Americas, is hard and fails to sprout even when planted carefully. When it has passed through the gut of a pronghorn it germinates readily, and the little pile of moist dung provides an excellent start to life well away from the parent tree. [...] The stems and leaves of some plants lower the surface velocity of sand-carrying winds and protect the ground from erosion. Even small fungi and microscopic plant organisms found on the soil surface (so-called cryptobiotic soil) can be a vital link in preventing erosion and providing support for other living organisms. Some plants, including the Plantago Lanceolata, have to reproduce via wind pollination due to living in the environment. Cold deserts often have high concentrations of salt in the soil. Grasses and low shrubs are the dominant vegetation here and the ground may be covered with lichens. Most shrubs have spiny leaves and shed them in the coldest part of the year.|$|E
