40|$|Climate {{change has}} the {{potential}} to alter the distributions of <b>threatened</b> plant <b>species,</b> and may therefore diminish the capacity of nature reserves to protect <b>threatened</b> plant <b>species.</b> Chinese nature reserves contain a rich diversity of plant species that are at risk of becoming more threatened by climate change. Hence, it is urgent to identify the extent to which future climate change may compromise the suitability of <b>threatened</b> plant <b>species</b> habitats within Chinese nature reserves. Here, we modelled the climate suitability of 82 <b>threatened</b> plant <b>species</b> within 168 nature reserves across climate change scenarios. We used Maxent modelling based on species occurrence localities and evaluated climate change impacts using the magnitude of change in climate suitability and the degree of overlap between current and future climatically suitable habitats. There was a significant relationship between overlap with current and future climate suitability of all <b>threatened</b> plant <b>species</b> habitats and the magnitude of changes in climate suitability. Our projections estimate that the climate suitability of more than 60 <b>threatened</b> plant <b>species</b> will decrease and that climate change threatens the habitat suitability of plant species in more than 130 nature reserves under the low, medium, and high greenhouse gas concentration scenarios by both 2050 s and 2080 s. Furthermore, future climate change may substantially <b>threaten</b> tree plant <b>species</b> through changes in annual mean temperature. These results indicate that climate change may <b>threaten</b> plant <b>species</b> that occur within Chinese nature reserves. Therefore, we suggest that climate change projections should be integrated into the conservation and management of <b>threatened</b> plant <b>species</b> within nature reserves...|$|R

5|$|The {{rocks are}} home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which {{includes}} over 200 species of wildflowers. Vernal pools atop the plateaus fill {{during the rainy season}} in winter and spring because the andesite is impermeable. The dwarf woolly meadowfoam, a species of wildflower, grows around these pools, and is endemic to the rocks. The pools are also one of only a few places where the federally <b>threatened</b> <b>species</b> of fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, can be found.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study used}} {{a sample of}} 106 {{countries}} to investigate {{the link between the}} number of <b>threatened</b> plant <b>species</b> and tourism which was proxied by the number of international tourist arrivals. In the analysis, we also include GDP per capita, population growth, and land under crop, which act as the control variables. We find that using OLS, the number of international tourist arrivals, population growth rate and land cultivated with crop increases the number of <b>threatened</b> plant <b>species,</b> while GDP per capita reduces the number of <b>threatened</b> plant <b>species.</b> Our further analysis using quantile regression indicates that tourism affected positively the number of <b>threatened</b> plant <b>species</b> for all quantiles (0. 05 0. 25 0. 50 0. 75 0. 90 0. 95); crop production (positively) at middle quantiles (0. 50 0. 75); GDP per capita (negatively) at lower quantiles (0. 05 0. 25); and population growth (positively) at middle quantiles (0. 50 0. 75). Our analysis clearly indicates that using estimates from OLS may have serious “bad” policy implications on the number of <b>threatened</b> plant <b>species,</b> compared to the quantile method that can capture properly the dimension of the <b>threatened</b> plant <b>species.</b> As for tourism, our study supports the effort for biodiversity conservation and sustainable tourism worldwide...|$|R
