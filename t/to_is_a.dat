500|$|Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham admires {{the track}} as [...] "beautifully put together"; he {{describes}} it as both [...] "some of the most exotic music released under The Beatles' name" [...] and a [...] "philosophical meditation on life and love beyond self... once surrendered <b>to,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{central part of the}} Pepper experience". In his book on the history of ambient music, Mark Prendergast includes [...] "Within You Without You" [...] among the album's [...] "three outstanding cuts" [...] and deems it to be [...] "the most timeless piece of dronal psychedelia ever recorded".

500|$|An example several {{commentators}} point <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 2014 study {{funded by}} Save the Elephants {{that found that}} the price of ivory tripled in China during four years following 2011. It correlated that trend to an increase in poaching as well as an increase in the frequency of high-profile events in which stockpiles were destroyed. Research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research offer an alternative theory: that the increase in price and demand [...] "likely originated" [...] with CITES's experimental allowance of a legal sale of a large amount of ivory in 2008. More recently, however, Save the Elephants reported the cost of ivory in China has fallen by nearly half, following an announcement by the Chinese government that it would phase out its domestic trade. In Japan, the demand for ivory has decreased since 2012 as a result of new consumer awareness through education about the connection between buying ivory and the killing of elephants.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to Ernest Thayer's 1888 baseball poem [...] "Casey at the Bat." [...] The episode makes several allusions to the film The Natural. Homer's secret weapon, his self-created [...] "Wonderbat", is akin to Roy Hobbs's [...] "Wonderboy", and both bats are eventually destroyed. The scene featuring the explosion of stadium lights as Homer circles the basepaths is also taken directly from the film. The end song [...] "Talkin' Softball" [...] is a parody of [...] "Talkin' Baseball" [...] by Terry Cashman. Jeff Martin wrote the {{new version of the}} song, but Cashman was brought in to sing it. The scenes of the Power Plant team traveling from city to city by train, overlaid with the pennant of the city they are going <b>to,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reference to the 1942 film The Pride of the Yankees.

500|$|Ben Williams from New York {{magazine}} {{described the}} song as sounding both throbbing {{as well as}} wistful. Christian John Wikane from PopMatters called the song a propulsive track. Alan Braidwood of the BBC, noted of the track: [...] "full-on dance, dark, disco, fun, big" [...] and compared it to other Madonna songs like [...] "Vogue", [...] "Deeper and Deeper" [...] and [...] "Ray of Light". Tom Bishop from the BBC commented that Madonna has either reinvigorated her career or she is [...] "merely throwing one final dance party for her long-term fans before settling down to record more sedate material". Jason Shawhan from About.com commented that the song has [...] "way too much Abba in it for its own good." [...] He went on to elaborate that [...] "he only reason I can think of {{for this to be}} chosen as the first single was the Motorola ad campaign. It's not a bad song by far, it has pep and a sense of fun, but it's not even close to being one of the best songs on the record". Bill Lamb of About.com said that the ABBA sample sounded completely effortless like much of Madonna's best dance music. He further elaborated that what [...] "'Hung Up' amounts <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> big gushy love note to Madonna's core fans, those club kids who pack the floor every time they hear the pounding beats of a Madonna classic and the dj's who can't get enough of spinning her records. 'Hung Up' will send those fans into ecstasy, and it sounds good on the radio, too". Thomas Inskeep of Stylus Magazine declared that [...] "Hung Up" [...] and the next single [...] "Sorry" [...] might not have the same sleaze as Madonna's older songs like [...] "Physical Attraction" [...] or [...] "Burning Up", but have the same modus operandi of being designed for [...] "sweaty up-all-night dancing". Rob Harvilla from The Village Voice called the song a triumphant jazz exercise.|$|E

2500|$|Exactly {{what the}} term peace (in sacrifice-of-peace offering) refers <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> matter of debate, as {{is whether the}} deity {{was seen as a}} guest at the meal or as the host. Some {{scholars}} hold that the sacrifice-of-peace offering was a covenant of friendship expressing community between God and the people, and among the people themselves; that these groups were at peace with one another. Others claim that it is an attempt to balance the books when positive events occur, attributed to God, by favouring God with a meal, or by fulfilling a vow previously made, as appropriate to the situation; that rehabilitation is achieved and the people restored to perfection (make perfect being a possible meaning of shelamim). In the latter of these possibilities, and partly in the former, the sacrifice is regarded as for God, and hence that the people are merely guests at the meal.|$|E
