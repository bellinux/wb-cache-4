5|$|Of Antisthenes' Aspasia {{only two}} or three {{quotations}} are extant. This dialogue contains much slander, but also anecdotes pertaining to Pericles' biography. Antisthenes appears to have attacked not only Aspasia, but <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>family</b> of Pericles, including his sons. The philosopher believes that the great statesman chose the life of pleasure over virtue. Thus, Aspasia is presented as the personification of the life of sexual indulgence.|$|E

5|$|Petrović {{worked for}} a number of landlords {{throughout}} Šumadija until 1787, when he and his family left the region and settled in the Austrian Empire, fearing persecution {{at the hands of the}} Ottoman janissaries. It is said that as they were preparing to cross the Danube into Austria, Petrović's father began to have second thoughts about leaving Šumadija. Knowing that <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>family</b> would be put in jeopardy if his father stayed behind, Petrović either took his father's life or arranged for someone to kill him instead.|$|E
5|$|Pursuit of {{specific}} and narrow {{areas of interest}} {{is one of the}} most striking possible features of AS. Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic. For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography. This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6. Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction so much that <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>family</b> may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.|$|E

5|$|Ralph {{ultimately}} {{crosses the}} line when, in a cocaine-induced rage, {{he gets into}} a confrontation with girlfriend Tracee and beats her to death. She may have been pregnant with his child at the time.

5|$|Several people {{claimed to}} be {{surviving}} members of the Romanov family following the assassinations. A woman named Marga Boodts {{claimed to be}} Grand Duchess Olga. Boodts lived in a villa on Lake Como in Italy and {{was said to be}} supported by the former kaiser, Wilhelm II and by the Pope. Prince Sigismund of Prussia, son of Alexandra's sister, Irene, said he accepted her as Olga, and Sigismund also supported Anastasia claimant Anna Anderson. His mother, Irene, did not believe either woman. Most historians discount her claim and believe Olga died with her family. Michael Goleniewski, an Alexei pretender, claimed his 'sisters' were Olga and Tatiana, and <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>family</b> had escaped.|$|E

The building was designed by a local architectural firm, William Lim Associates, which adopted a postmodern pluralist approach, expressed through a multiplicity of materials and forms.|$|E

5|$|The group {{traveled}} to Italy in early 1818. They first surrendered Allegra to Byron in April, much to Claire's distress. In August, Percy Shelley took Claire to see Allegra, at her request. Percy arrived in Venice, telling Byron he had <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>family.</b> Mary was thus summoned to Venice to substantiate Percy's story. However, baby Clara Shelley {{was sick and}} traveling made her even more ill. She died shortly after arriving in Venice. In the winter of 1818, Percy registered a child in Naples to himself and Mary: Elena Adelaide. However, it is unclear who this child's parents really were.|$|E
5|$|Cliff (Bill Cosby) {{comes home}} from a long day at work and tries to take a nap.

They have a hard time explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, the older kids start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a memorial service for the fish around the family toilet. When Cliff feels {{that the rest of the}} family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>family</b> to participate in a memorial service for Lamont in the bathroom in proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because she wants to say goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the toilet.|$|E
