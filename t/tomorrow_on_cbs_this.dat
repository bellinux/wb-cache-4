One of the main professionals that {{have been affected by}} CB are school social workers. The purpose of this qualitative study was to identify what social workers need to know about <b>CB.</b> <b>This</b> study used a qualitative study design because we wanted to obtain an in-depth examination of CB views and beliefs. Data was gathered from 8 middle school teachers, a school principal and a school counselor from a public school in the western region of the United States. In the study participants were interviewed with ten questions focusing <b>on</b> <b>CB.</b> <b>This</b> study’s findings indicated 10 major themes which are the following:almost all participants were able to provide examples of CB occurring in the social networking website Facebook, {{more than half of all}} participants could not name any specific CB school policies or laws,the majority of all respondents had distinct views of the protocol for reporting CB,more than half of all the participants had different views of CB symptoms,the respondents were split in half on their beliefs of CB occurring more than traditional bullying,almost all participants believed that this public elementary and middle school took CB seriously, almost all of the teachers were uncertain whether CB was a problem at this public elementary and middle school, almost all of teachers had different ideas for preventing CB, almost all middle school teachers had different ideas for what helping professionals should know about iv CB, almost all teachers suggested different ideas for social workers to prevent CB. Future research should include training for school professionals on how to address CB as our results found that most participants were uncertain as to what to do and thus would be better able to provide suggestions for what social workers should know <b>on</b> <b>CB...</b>|$|R
40|$|SummaryIn the Drosophila ovary, {{germline}} {{stem cells}} (GSCs) are maintained primarily by {{bone morphogenetic protein}} (BMP) ligands produced by the stromal cells of the niche. This signaling represses GSC differentiation by blocking the transcription of the differentiation factor Bam. Remarkably, bam transcription begins only one cell diameter away from the GSC in the daughter cystoblasts (<b>CBs).</b> How <b>this</b> steep gradient of response to BMP signaling is formed has been unclear. Here, we show that Fused (Fu), a serine/threonine kinase that regulates Hedgehog, functions {{in concert with the}} E 3 ligase Smurf to regulate ubiquitination and proteolysis of the BMP receptor Thickveins in <b>CBs.</b> <b>This</b> regulation generates a steep gradient of BMP activity between GSCs and CBs, allowing for bam expression <b>on</b> <b>CBs</b> and concomitant differentiation. We observed similar roles for Fu during embryonic development in zebrafish and in human cell culture, implying broad conservation of this mechanism...|$|R

40|$|A counter braid (CB) {{is a novel}} counter {{architecture}} {{introduced by}} Lu et al. in 2007 for per-flow measurements <b>on</b> high-speed links. <b>CBs</b> achieve an asymptotic compression rate (under optimal decoding) that matches the entropy lower bound of the flow size distribution. Spatially-coupled CBs (SC-CBs) have recently been proposed. In this work, we further analyze single-layer CBs and SC-CBs using an equivalent bipartite graph representation of <b>CBs.</b> <b>On</b> <b>this</b> equivalent representation, we show that the potential and area thresholds are equal. We also show that the area under the extended belief propagation (BP) extrinsic information transfer curve (defined for the equivalent graph), computed for the expected residual CB graph when a peeling decoder equivalent to the BP decoder stops, is equal to zero precisely at the area threshold. This, combined with simulations and an asymptotic analysis of the Maxwell decoder, leads to the conjecture that the area threshold is in fact equal to the Maxwell decoding threshold and hence a lower bound on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding threshold. Finally, we present some numerical results and give {{some insight into the}} apparent gap of the BP decoding threshold of SC-CBs to the conjectured lower bound on the MAP decoding threshold.

The optimum decomposition rate of 2 CB was obtained with TiO 2 /HZSM- 11 (30 %) (TiO 2 30 wt. %) catalyst at {{a concentration of}} 1 &# 160;mg&# 160;mL- 1. 2 CB and 3 CB decompose at similar rates, but 4 <b>CB</b> remains adsorbed <b>on</b> TiO 2 /HZSM- 11 (30 %) without further degradation. This absorption is attributed to the relative positions of Cl and COOH groups <b>on</b> 4 <b>CB.</b> However, <b>this</b> compound can be partially degraded and/or removed from aqueous solutions by TiO 2 /HZSM- 11 (50 %) catalyst or HZSM- 11 zeolite. TiO 2 /HZSM- 11 (30 %) is stable; it retains its photocatalytic properties after nine cycles, can be easily removed and immediately reused. These are important advantages of TiO 2 /HZSM- 11 (30 %) over unsupported TiO 2, making it a good photocatalyst {{for the treatment of}} polluted water. On the other hand, HZSM- 11 could be used to selectively adsorb 4 CB, thus becoming an alternative method of environmental remediation...|$|R

40|$|Despite its widely {{recognized}} relevance in both management and marketing strategies to gain competitive advantage, {{the field of}} corporate brand studies suffers {{from a number of}} highly fragmented perspectives, that make it difficult to identify common strategic guidelines based on shared knowledge to discern the value of corporate branding (CB) and orient its practices.

However, the situation regarding visuospatial memory is less clear. In a widely used measure, the Corsi blocks task, sequences of visuospatial locations can be recalled forwards, in the order presented (CF), or backwards, in reverse order (CB). Previous research has suggested that, while CF draws <b>on</b> spatial-sequential resources, <b>CB</b> may load executive and distinctly visual processes. While people with dyslexia typically show no deficit <b>on</b> CF, <b>CB</b> is rarely presented. We present three studies which indicate a consistent dyslexic deficit <b>on</b> <b>CB</b> that can be ameliorated by visual strategy instructions. Our data suggest that, without instruction, people with dyslexia are unable to adopt an effective <b>CB</b> strategy and <b>this</b> is consistent with a deficit in executive function.

Clear preference {{of most of the}} amino acids towards certain secondary structure type classifies amino acids into four groups: alpha-helix admirers, strand admirers, turn and bend admirers and the others. Group four consists of His and Cis, the amino acids that do not show clear preference for any secondary structure.
