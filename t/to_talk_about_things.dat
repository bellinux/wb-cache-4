25|$|Agnes, on {{the other}} hand, has a preprogrammed script in her head that {{contains}} all the social rules of conduct. She is easily embarrassed and uses most of her energies attempting to keep others from saying or doing things that go against her rules. In other words, she escapes the nasty or difficult parts of life by defining them as taboo subjects. Agnes hides from reality behind the rules. If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She does not want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> that are unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor excuse for a life. She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her daughter will eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does {{not have time to}} deal with all those emotions. Even though she suspects that her husband had an affair, she only asks the people whom she knows will not confirm her suspicions.|$|E
2500|$|Though Lynn {{has been}} outspoken about her views on often {{controversial}} {{social and political}} subjects, she stated, [...] "I don't like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> where you're {{going to get one}} side or the other unhappy. My music has no politics." [...] She has visited the White House six times since 1976, under both Republican and Democratic presidents, and in her autobiography, she said her father was a Republican and her mother a Democrat. When asked about same-sex marriage by USA Today in November 2010, she replied, [...] "I'm still an old Bible girl. God said you need to be a woman and man, but everybody to their own." [...] She endorsed and, along with Peggy Sue and Crystal Gayle, campaigned for George H. W. Bush in the presidential election in 1988.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of her second album Mistaken Identity in 2004, Delta {{reflected}} that the album was rushed – written and recorded {{while she was still}} recovering from chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Goodrem remarked that she felt overexposed and claimed, [...] "I'd burnt myself out. By the end of 'Mistaken Identity' I thought, 'This is nothing of what I am. I know I can do all of this a lot better'." [...] After a period of being angry, Delta felt she was healed and embraced herself and being in the public eye. Therefore, she started developing a new album, stating, [...] "For a while I was writing songs for this album I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things,</b> so I didn't want to write about them either. [...] "I had to get over a couple of things. My parents divorced, there was a lot going on. But now I truly am inspired again. I feel regenerated. I feel I've got my energy back." ...|$|E
50|$|Mitchell and Twofour met {{at least}} once a day <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the <b>things</b> the cameras has been {{following}} and ask Mitchell if he had any concerns or comments. He did not have any editorial control but the relationship with Twofour and Channel 4 enabled him <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> openly <b>about</b> <b>things</b> that might concern Mitchell and the staff, and their comments were taken into consideration when the final cut was made.|$|R

40|$|This talk {{is between}} two college {{girls who are}} the {{speakers}} of two different dialects of Chintang (Mulgaun and Sambugaun). The whole talk is concentrated on their own general matters. The conversation {{took place on the}} collector's request. I (NP) requested them (in Nepali) <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>thing</b> like 'they did not meet us, you did not ask us', etc in order to get more examples of multiple prefix forms. The speakers decided <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> getting together and going to the movie theater the other day. The recording was done at Dhankuta bazar. The recording quality is good...|$|R
2500|$|Jackson's {{representative}} Stephen Huvane stated [...] "Personally, she’s {{not comfortable}} with being Janet in public [...] When she’s performing, that’s a different thing. We always planned that when the album came out, we would do the proper promotion." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam commented, [...] "Between albums she likes to go live life, recharge her batteries {{and be able to}} share her experiences. It not only raises her artistic level, she's able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> she's going through -- and other people can relate. That's {{one of the things that}} allows her to connect truly with the fans." [...] Prior to promotion, Jackson performed a medley of [...] "All for You", [...] "Rhythm Nation", and [...] "The Knowledge" [...] at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. Surprise guest Justin Timberlake arrived to perform a duet version of [...] "Rock Your Body," [...] which ended in Jackson's breast being accidentally exposed. The incident resulted in the U.S. Federal Communications Commission enforcing massive fines on conglomerates involved with the broadcast, including CBS, Viacom, and MTV; who then blacklisted Jackson on many radio formats and music channels worldwide as a result.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{the young}} folks don't any of 'em seem <b>to</b> want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> such <b>things</b> nowadays, and I don't know as they ever did." [...] Whitwell took Westover into his {{confidence}} with a wink.|$|R
6000|$|Nedda's spirit gave a jump; {{he seemed}} almost {{at last to}} be going <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the <b>things</b> she wanted, above all, to find out. Her cheeks went hot, she clenched her hands and said resolutely: ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{very much}} more {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> a <b>thing</b> than <b>to</b> do it. In the sphere of actual life that is, of course, obvious. Anybody can make history, only a great man can write it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh; a swell. I fancy I do like slang. I think it's awfully jolly <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> being jolly. Only that I {{was afraid}} of your nerves I should have called him stunning. It's so slow, you know, to use nothing but words out of a dictionary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{really came}} for the chance of seeing you alone," [...] said Will, mysteriously forced {{to be just as}} simple as she was. He could not stay to ask himself, why not? [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things,</b> as we did in Rome. It always makes a {{difference}} when other people are present." ...|$|E
60|$|On this {{particular}} night, therefore, work was 'off'. Merevale was {{over at the}} Great Hall, taking preparation, and the Sixth-Form Merevalians had assembled in Charteris's study <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> in general. It was after a pause of some moments, that had followed upon a lively discussion of the House's prospects in the forthcoming final, that Charteris had spoken.|$|E
6000|$|ERNEST. Gilbert, {{you sound}} too harsh a note. Let us {{go back to}} the more gracious fields of literature. What was it you said? That it was more {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> a <b>thing</b> than <b>to</b> do it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friends," [...] he said, [...] "you {{have arrived}} {{just as we}} are {{assembling}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the <b>things</b> that concern our souls, the future life, and the Good Spirit. Will you and your men sit down and listen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind!" [...] She {{nodded to}} him and closed the window. [...] "We must {{remember}} all those, Clara," [...] said she. [...] "We must learn <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> such <b>things.</b> Mrs. Westmacott knows all about the brands of cigarettes. Has your rum come?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{went to her}} room, feeling downcast. She {{had failed}} to {{influence}} him, but it was partly her fault {{that she had been}} unable to do so. She had wasted her time in idle amusements, and now she must take the consequences. Nobody except Harding would listen when she wished <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> that mattered. She felt ashamed of her ignorance and of her utter helplessness. But perhaps she might learn; she would ask Hester Harding to teach her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guessed {{he wanted}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> outside the business, {{and so it}} was. We had a capital dinner down there, {{and then we had}} a long talk about you. I told him frankly that, though I was very glad to have you with me, I really did not see that it was of any use your being kept at that work. He said that he thought so, too, and had an idea on which he wanted my opinion. He was {{thinking}} of accepting your sister's invitation to go down and spend Christmas with her; and intended to ask her if they would take charge of you, for a couple of years, in order that you might learn Spanish. Of course, I said that it was the very best thing in the world for you; and would not be any loss of time because, if you could speak Spanish well, you would learn the business much more quickly when you went to Cadiz; and need not be so long abroad, then." ...|$|E
60|$|This kind {{of thing}} {{represents}} female intellect in its best form. Every man that is really a man is willing to recognize it at once. As to the young men, of course they flocked to the Rasselyer-Brown residence in shoals. There were batches of them every Sunday afternoon at five o'clock, encased in long black frock-coats, sitting very rigidly in upright chairs, trying to drink tea with one hand. One might see athletic young college men of the football team trying hard to talk about Italian music; and Italian tenors from the Grand Opera {{doing their best to}} talk about college football. There were young men in business talking about art, and young men in art talking about religion, and young clergymen talking about business. Because, of course, the Rasselyer-Brown residence was the kind of cultivated home where people of education and taste are at liberty <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> they don't know, and to utter freely ideas that they haven't got. It was only now and again, when one of the professors from the college across the avenue came booming into the room, that the whole conversation was pulverized into dust under the hammer of accurate knowledge.|$|E
5000|$|Talk {{in terms}} of the other person's interest. The royal road to a person's heart is <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the <b>things</b> he or she treasures most.

5000|$|... httpRange-14 is {{a long-running}} logical {{conundrum}} or design {{problem in the}} semantic web. The problem arises because when HTTP is extended from referring only <b>to</b> documents <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> real-world <b>things</b> (planets, flowers, emotions, Platonic forms, etc) the domain of HTTP GET becomes undefined.|$|R

6000|$|Some {{fall back}} simply on the clock: they talk as if mere passage through time brought some superiority; {{so that even}} {{a man of the}} first mental calibre {{carelessly}} uses the phrase that human morality is never up to date. How can anything be up to date?-- a date has no character. How can one say that Christmas celebrations are not suitable to the twenty-fifth of a month? What the writer meant, of course, was that the majority is behind his favourite minority--or in front of it. Other vague modern people take refuge in material metaphors; in fact, this is the chief mark of vague modern people. Not daring to define their doctrine of what is good, they use physical figures of speech without stint or shame, and, what is worst of all, seem to think these cheap analogies are exquisitely spiritual and superior to the old morality. Thus they think it intellectual <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> being [...] "high." [...] It is at least the reverse of intellectual; it is a mere phrase from a steeple or a weathercock. [...] "Tommy was a good boy" [...] is a pure philosophical statement, worthy of Plato or Aquinas. [...] "Tommy lived the higher life" [...] is a gross metaphor from a ten-foot rule.|$|E
60|$|I have {{received}} {{a great deal of}} politeness--some of it really most pressing, and I have experienced no drawbacks whatever. I have made a great many pleasant acquaintances in travelling round (both ladies and gentlemen), and had a great many most interesting talks. I have collected a great deal of information, for which I refer you to my journal. I assure you my journal {{is going to be a}} splendid thing. I do just exactly as I do in Bangor, and I find I do perfectly right; and at any rate, I don't care if I don't. I didn't come to Europe to lead a merely conventional life; I could do that at Bangor. You know I never would do it at Bangor, so it isn't likely I am going to make myself miserable over here. So long as I accomplish what I desire, and make my money hold out, I shall regard the thing as a success. Sometimes I feel rather lonely, especially in the evening; but I generally manage to interest myself in something or in some one. In the evening I usually read up about the objects of interest I have visited during the day, or I post up my journal. Sometimes I go to the theatre; or else I play the piano in the public parlour. The public parlour at the hotel isn't much; but the piano is better than that fearful old thing at the Sebago House. Sometimes I go downstairs and talk to the lady who keeps the books--a French lady, who is remarkably polite. She is very pretty, and always wears a black dress, with the most beautiful fit; she speaks a little English; she tells me she had to learn it in order to converse with the Americans who come in such numbers to this hotel. She has given me a great deal of information about the position of woman in France, and much of it is very encouraging. But she has told me at the same time some things that I should not like to write to you (I am hesitating even about putting them into my journal), especially if my letters are to be handed round in the family. I assure you they appear <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> here that we never think of mentioning at Bangor, or even of thinking about. She seems to think she can tell me everything, because I told her I was travelling for general culture. Well, I do want to know so much that it seems sometimes as if I wanted to know everything; and yet there are some things that I think I don't want to know. But, as a general thing, everything is intensely interesting; I don't mean only everything that this French lady tells me, but everything I see and hear for myself. I feel really as if I should gain all I desire.|$|E
60|$|I’ve {{received}} {{a great deal}} of politeness—some of it really most pressing, and have experienced no drawbacks whatever. I’ve made a great many pleasant acquaintances in travelling round—both ladies and gentlemen—and had a great many interesting and open-hearted, if quite informal, talks. I’ve collected a great many remarkable facts—I guess we don’t know quite everything at Bangor—for which I refer you to my journal. I assure you my journal’s going to be a splendid picture of an earnest young life. I do just exactly as I do in Bangor, and I find I do perfectly right. At any rate I don’t care if I don’t. I didn’t come to Europe to lead a merely conventional society life: I could do that at Bangor. You know I never would do it at Bangor, so it isn’t likely I’m going to worship false gods over here. So long as I accomplish what I desire and make my money hold out I shall regard the thing as a success. Sometimes I feel rather lonely, especially evenings; but I generally manage to interest myself in something or in some one. I mostly read up, evenings, on the objects of interest I’ve visited during the day, or put in time on my journal. Sometimes I go to the theatre or else play the piano in the public parlour. The public parlour at the hotel isn’t much; but the piano’s better than that fearful old thing at the Sebago House.

I assure you they appear <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>things</b> here that we never think of mentioning at Bangor, even to ourselves or to our very closest; and it has struck me that people are closer—to each other—down in Maine than seems mostly to be expected here.

Well, I do want to know so much that it seems sometimes as if I wanted to know most everything; and yet I guess {{there are some things that}} don’t count for improvement.
