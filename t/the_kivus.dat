25|$|The AFDL {{continued}} its offensive until it reached Kinshasa and overthrew Mobutu in 1997. Mobutu fled Zaire and soon died in exile four months later. Afterwards, Kabila named himself {{the new president}} and changed {{the name of the}} country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, the relationship between Kabila and his Rwandan and Ugandan backers turned sour. An attempt by Rwanda and Uganda to overthrow Kabila in 1998 grew into the Second Congo War, the world's deadliest conflict since World War II. While peace was officially declared in 2003, ethnically inspired violence continues to afflict <b>the</b> <b>Kivus.</b>|$|E
25|$|In October 2010, the Executive Secretary, Callixte Mbarushimana, {{was arrested}} in France under a sealed warrant from the International Criminal Court (ICC) for crimes against {{humanity}} and war crimes allegedly committed in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> (Democratic Republic of the Congo). The warrant concerns widespread attacks allegedly committed by FDLR troops against civilians in North and South Kivu in 2009. The Court's judges state that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Mbarushimana bears criminal responsibility for these attacks, including murder, torture, rape, persecution and inhumane acts. The warrant alleges that Mbarushimana {{was part of a}} plan to create a humanitarian catastrophe to extract concessions of political power for the FDLR.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, {{the issue}} of land and {{indigenous}} claims in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> erupted into bloody conflict. [...] Hutu, and some Tutsi, landlords began buying the lands of poor Hutu and Bahunde of the Wanyanga chiefdom in Masisi, North Kivu. [...] After being displaced, one thousand people went to Walikale, demanding the right to elect their own ethnic leaders. [...] The Banyanga, insisting that only [...] "indigenous people" [...] could claim this customary right, began fighting with the Hutu.|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} {{became more}} polarised {{with the beginning}} of the Second Congo War in 1998. [...] Those who had carried out the massacres of Hutu became part of the ruling military forces in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus.</b> [...] Meanwhile, the Congolese government of Laurent Kabila urged the [...] "indigenous" [...] population to fight not only the invading RPF, but the rebelling Banyamulenge and Tutsi civilians. [...] Matching actions to words, Kabila armed [...] "indigenous" [...] Mai-Mai and Congolese Hutu in response to the RPF's supplying arms to the Banyamulenge. The two Mai-Mai groups most active against the Banyamulenge are the Babembe and Balega militias.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1996, a Zairean {{government}} official based in Bukavu {{declared that the}} Banyamulenge {{would be forced to}} leave the country, apparently as an attempt to end the conflict between them and the Hutu militants. This led to an uprising of the Banyamulenge in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus,</b> who were now well-armed by the RPF, and an exchange of mortar fire between the armies of Zaire and Rwanda across Lake Kivu. [...] With a speed that many observers found suspicious, Kabila found himself head of the well-supplied rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Zaire (AFDL), which included the Banyamulenge militias. This new conflict {{came to be known as}} the First Congo War. At the time, Rwanda officially denied any military connection to the new rebel group, although it openly expressed support for its goal of overthrowing Mobutu.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 August 1998 the Banyamulenge in {{the town}} of Goma erupted into mutiny. Rwanda offered {{immediate}} assistance to the Banyamulenge and early in August a well-armed rebel group, the Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD)—composed primarily of Banyamulenge and backed by Rwanda and Uganda—had emerged. This group quickly came to dominate the resource-rich eastern provinces and based its operations in Goma. The RCD quickly took control of the towns of Bukavu and Uvira in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus.</b> The Tutsi-led Rwandan government allied with Uganda, and Burundi also retaliated, occupying a portion of northeastern Congo. To help remove the occupying Rwandans, President Kabila enlisted the aid of refugee Hutus in eastern Congo and began to agitate public opinion against the Tutsis, resulting in several public lynchings in the streets of Kinshasa. On 12 August a loyalist army major broadcast a message urging resistance from a radio station in Bunia in eastern Congo: [...] "People must bring a machete, a spear, an arrow, a hoe, spades, rakes, nails, truncheons, electric irons, barbed wire, stones, and the like, in order, dear listeners, to kill the Rwandan Tutsis." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1991 Sovereign National Conference (CNS) {{was a sign}} of the {{increasing}} coherence of the anti-Mobutu forces and came as the Congolese Banyarwanda were in a state of heightened tension. [...] Following the beginning of the Rwandan Civil War in 1990, many young Tutsi men in Kivu decided to cross the border to join the Tutsi-dominated rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) in its fight against the Hutu-dominated Rwandan government. [...] In response, the Mobutu government implemented Mission d'Identification de Zaïrois au Kivu to identify non-Zairean Banyarwanda, using the end of the Berlin Conference as the division point. [...] Many Banyarwanda whose families had come as colonial labourers were classified as aliens, resulting in yet more youth joining the RPF. [...] The overall effect of the CNS was to strengthen the tendency of [...] "indigenous" [...] Congolese to differentiate between Tutsi from Hutu, and lump together all Tutsi Banyarwanda as [...] "Banyamulenge". [...] It also underlined the fragility of their political position to the Banyamulenge. [...] Within the Banyarwanda in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus,</b> the Hutu began defining themselves as [...] "indigenous" [...] in comparison to the Tutsis, who were increasingly seen as owing their allegiance to the foreign groups.|$|E

50|$|Other {{measures}} in the resolution included a requirement for the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the States bordering Ituri and <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> to take the necessary measures to strengthen customs controls along the borders between Ituri or <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> and the neighbouring States, as well as travel restrictions on and freezing of assets of persons or entities designated by the Committee.|$|E
50|$|On 13 July 2012, the ICC {{announced}} an arrest mandate against the FDLR chief Sylvestre Mudacumura {{for war crimes}} committed in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> as well as against Bosco Ntaganda.|$|E
50|$|It {{was decided}} that the troops present in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> will be {{assembled}} under the unified command of a brigade. In March the Nigerian General Samaila Iliya took over the command of the force.|$|E
50|$|The {{prosecutor}} of the International Criminal Court {{sought an}} arrest warrant against him, alleging responsibility for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in 2009-10 in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus.</b> The warrant was issued on 13 July 2012.|$|E
50|$|The Rwandan-backed RCD {{continued}} {{to be the primary}} Tutsi force aligned with Rwanda and Burundi. Rwanda appeared to decide that maintaining a sphere of influence in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> through proxy forces is in its best interests. This is similar to the policy that Uganda had decided upon several years earlier.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to these 2007 figures, In March 2010, {{it was reported that}} the DRC's land forces had ordered US$80 million worth of military equipment from Ukraine which included 20 T-72 main battle tanks, 100 trucks and various small arms. 20 x T-72 have been reported by World Defence Almanac.

50|$|Unanimously {{adopting}} resolution 1794 (2007) {{and acting}} under Chapter VII of the United Nations’ Charter, the Council authorized the continuation until that date {{of up to}} 17,030 military personnel, 760 military observers, 391 police trainers and 750 personnel of formed police units and requested MONUC to attach the highest priority to addressing the crisis in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> in all its dimensions.|$|E
50|$|The role of {{conflict}} minerals is highly debated. Certain NGOs, like the Enough Project, {{claim that the}} illegal exploitation of minerals is {{the main cause of}} the ongoing violence in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus.</b> However, many academic and independent researchers (both Congolese and international) challenge this interpretation, arguing that conflict minerals are one of the many causes of violence, and most likely not the most important one.|$|E
50|$|During {{this period}} Congolese living in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> {{increasingly}} came {{to view the}} RCD as a brutal oppressor. Rwanda had nearly complete control of the organization, while the RCD continued to increase taxation with no noticeable improvement in infrastructure or basic services. The RCD's undisciplined troops, {{along with those of}} other armed groups, were also responsible for acts of brutality against the population. Kivutians also criticize the dominance of Banyamulenge.|$|E

50|$|Unanimously {{adopting}} resolution 1843 (2008), the Council, acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter {{and following}} the recommendations by the Secretary-General in his letter of 12 November (document S/2008/703), authorized the immediate deployment of those additional capacities until 31 December. It expressed its intention to extend that authorization {{on the occasion of}} MONUC’s mandate renewal, underlining that the duration of stay of the additional forces would depend on the security situation in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{alliance}} of foreign military forces disintegrated when people of Hutu descent were massacred {{by the thousands}} in western Zaire and because of looting in the mining areas, in particular, Kisangani and <b>the</b> <b>Kivus.</b> The population was completely opposed {{to the presence of}} foreign forces because of their behaviour. Laurent-Désiré Kabila could not continue to support the use of Kisangani as the base for foreign fighters as they launched attacks to massacre the Hutu people - hence he demanded that Rwanda pull its forces out of the country.|$|E
50|$|Addressing the {{conflict}} in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> and Ituri in {{the east of the}} country, the Council demanded unimpeded access to MONUC personnel to all areas, requested the Secretary-General to deploy military observers in North and South Kivu and Ituri, and imposed an arms embargo against foreign and Congolese armed groups operating in the regions. The embargo would not apply to MONUC, Operation Artemis, integrated Congolese army and police forces, or non-lethal military equipment for humanitarian or protective use. The Council declared that the measures would be reviewed in twelve months and compliance would be closely monitored.|$|E
50|$|The AFDL {{continued}} its offensive until it reached Kinshasa and overthrew Mobutu in 1997. Mobutu fled Zaire and soon died in exile four months later.

5000|$|Mudacumura is an FDLR 'westerner', {{belonging}} {{to the group of}} rebels who were previously based in Kamina and fought alongside the Forces Armées Congolaise, as opposed to the group that stayed in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus.</b> Since 2003, there has been tension within the FDLR as Mudacumura has replaced 'easterners' with 'westerners' in the command structure. [...] He is implicated in the December 2006 death of the former FOCA second in command, Colonel Jean Baptist Kanyandekwe, who died of poisoning at a party thrown by the FOCA head. Kanyandekwe is said to have led a faction advocating for the end of hostilities and the return of the rebels to Rwanda.|$|E
5000|$|Mai-Mai were {{particularly}} {{active in the}} eastern Congolese provinces bordering Rwanda, North Kivu and South Kivu (the [...] "Kivus"), which were {{under the control of}} the Rwanda-allied Banyamulenge-dominated rebel faction, the Rally for Congolese Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma). While militias have long been common in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus,</b> particularly among the minority Batembo and Babembe ethnic groups, the recent wars and conflicts caused large numbers of town dwellers to form Mai-Mai. Although the Mai-Mai, either as a group or as individual groups, were not party to the 1999 Lusaka Accord meant to end the war, they remained one of the most powerful forces in the conflict and the lack of cooperation from some groups has been problematic for the peace process.|$|E
50|$|Hutu {{militias and}} members of the Hutu {{provisional}} government were among the refugees, and they set up operations from the camps around Goma attacking ethnic Tutsis in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> and Rwandan government forces at the border. For political reasons the Kinshasa government of the then Zaire led by Joseph Mobutu did not prevent the attacks, and so the Rwandan government and its Ugandan allies threw their support behind the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Zaire, a rebel movement led by Laurent Kabila against Mobutu. Rwandan forces stormed the camps at Goma, resulting in thousands of additional deaths, and with their help and that of Uganda, Kabila went on to overthrow Mobutu's regime in the First Congo War, which ended in 1997.|$|E
50|$|Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council {{expressed}} {{satisfaction that}} there was general observance of the ceasefire. It demanded that the Front de Libération du Congo disengage and redeploy in accordance with previously agreed plans and commitments made to the Security Council mission that visited the region. The Council again demanded that Ugandan, Rwandan and other foreign forces immediately withdraw from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. There was concern that military operations {{had taken place in}} <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> and the Rally for Congolese Democracy was urged to demilitarise Kisangani. All parties, including the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, had to cease support for armed groups. Meanwhile, incursions by armed groups into Rwanda and Burundi were condemned.|$|E
50|$|On 11 October 2010, Mbarushimana {{was arrested}} in France under a sealed warrant from the International Criminal Court for crimes against {{humanity}} and war crimes allegedly committed in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> (Democratic Republic of the Congo). The warrant concerns widespread attacks allegedly committed by troops of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), against civilians in North and South Kivu in 2009. The Court's judges state that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Mbarushimana, as Executive Secretary of the FDLR, bears criminal responsibility for these attacks, including murder, torture, rape, persecution and inhumane acts. The warrant alleges that Mbarushimana {{was part of a}} plan to create a humanitarian catastrophe to extract concessions of political power for the FDLR.|$|E
50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> were secured, the {{remainder}} of the First Congo War consisted for the most part of the ADFL and its allies walking and driving across Zaire to the capital, Kinshasa. The population proved to have a deep antipathy towards Mobutu Sese Seko after decades of corruption and despotism. Most of the demoralized soldiers in the national army either deserted, or joined the ADFL. Men from villages and towns throughout Zaire spontaneously joined the ADFL's advance. On 17 May 1997, after seven months of rebellion and a day after Mobutu fled the country, the ADFL successfully marched into Kinshasa and Kabila declared himself president and renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The ADFL then became the new national armed forces.|$|E
50|$|In 1997 Laurent-Désiré Kabila was {{installed}} as President of the DRC following the victory by the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL) in the First Congo War, with heavy {{support from the}} governments of Uganda and Rwanda. However, the ethnic tensions in eastern DRC did not disappear. Thousands of Hutu militants who had taken part in the Rwandan genocide and been forced to flee into the DRC maintained a low intensity war with the invading Rwandan army and their Banyamulenge co-ethnics living in the Congolese provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu. By February 1998 <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> were engulfed in ethnic warfare. Banyamulenge troops based {{in the town of}} Bukavu who belonged to the ADFL mutinied as tensions increased. The mutiny caused a souring of the relationship between Kabila and his Rwandan and Ugandan allies.|$|E
50|$|In October 1996, a Zairean {{government}} official based in Bukavu {{declared that the}} Banyamulenge {{would be forced to}} leave the country, apparently as an attempt to end the conflict between them and the Hutu militants. This led to an uprising of the Banyamulenge in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus,</b> who were now well-armed by the RPF, and an exchange of mortar fire between the armies of Zaire and Rwanda across Lake Kivu.

At the time, Rwanda officially denied any military connection to the new rebel group, although it openly expressed support for its goal of overthrowing Mobutu.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{preamble}} of Resolution 1925, the Council noted the progress {{made in the}} Democratic Republic of the Congo over the past 15 years and stressed {{the responsibility of the}} Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo of the respect for human rights, rule of law and international humanitarian law, and the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of Congolese and foreign troops. There were significant security problems in the east of the country, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> and Orientale regions. Addressing the situation in the Great Lakes region as a whole, the Council emphasised the illicit trade of natural resources and arms trafficking as major factors contributing to the conflicts in the region, and greater regional efforts were needed to tackle the issue, including legal action against the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).|$|E
50|$|According to a 2001 UN report, 20,000 to 30,000 Mai-Mai {{were active}} in the two Kivu provinces. The two most {{powerful}} and well-organized Mai-Mai groups in <b>the</b> <b>Kivus</b> were led by Generals Padiri and Dunia, {{but now it is}} another Mai-Maigroup which is called Mai-Mai Yakutumba which was organized in 2007 buy General Yakutumba, ex-Mai-Mai in 2001. They were reported to have received aid from the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and are widely viewed by other Mai Mai groups as the leaders, though not the commanders, of the Kivu Mai-Mai. A number of smaller Mai-Mai groups, such as the Mudundu 40/Front de Résistance et de Défense du Kivu (FRDKI) and Mouvement de Lutte contre l'Agression au Zaïre/Forces Unies de Résistance Nationale contre l'Agression de la Républíque Démocratique du Congo (MLAZ/FURNAC), were reported to cooperate with the Rwandan military and Rally for Congolese Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma).|$|E
