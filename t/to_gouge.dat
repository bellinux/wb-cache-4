5|$|Indriids {{such as the}} sifakas {{use their}} toothcombs <b>to</b> <b>gouge</b> bark or dead wood (bark-prising), which is done prior to scent-marking with the gland on their chest. The more robust {{structure}} of their toothcomb is thought to help it withstand the compressive forces experienced during regular bark-prising.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Salukis {{were used}} for hunting by nomadic tribes. Typical quarry {{included}} the gazelle, hare, fox and jackal. While hunting hares, Bedouin hunters would sometimes ride close to their quarry on a camel holding a Saluki, which would be thrown towards the prey while at speed to give the dog a running start. Gazelle hunters also used hawks <b>to</b> <b>gouge</b> out {{the eyes of the}} prey so that a Saluki could then bring down the blinded animal.|$|E

Band members Gossard and Ament testified at a subcommittee investigation on June 30, 1994 in Washington, D.C. Pearl Jam alleged that Ticketmaster used anti-competitive and monopolistic practices <b>to</b> <b>gouge</b> fans. After Pearl Jam’s testimony before Congress, Congressman Dingell (D-Mich.) wrote a bill requiring full disclosure to prevent Ticketmaster from burying escalating service fees. Pearl Jam’s manager said he was gratified that Congress recognized the problem as a national issue.|$|E

50|$|Access poses a challenge. An {{offshore}} {{production scheme}} necessarily aims for safe and economical operation {{throughout the year}} and the full lifespan of the project. Offshore production developments often consist of installations on the seabed itself, away from sea surface hazards (wind, waves, ice). In shallower waters, the production platform may rest directly on the seabed. Either way, if these installations include a submarine pipeline to deliver this resource to the shoreline, {{a substantial portion of}} its length could be exposed <b>to</b> <b>gouging</b> events.|$|R
5|$|The diet of the pygmy slow loris is seasonal. In north Vietnam, for example, {{the winter}} is {{characterized}} by low rainfalls and temperatures as low as , when there is little growth of vegetation in forests, few insects, and limited food resources. The pygmy slow loris will also consume insects that have been exposed by its bamboo-gouging activities. It will use its toothcomb to clean an area of lichens and fungi prior <b>to</b> <b>gouging.</b> The animals conserve energy in the colder winter months by reducing movement, often {{to the point of}} complete inactivity.|$|R
5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} is {{very fond}} of the larvae of tree-boring beetles, such as the longhorn beetle Tryphocaria acanthocera, and cossid moth Xyleutes boisduvali. Birds seek them out all year but especially in June and July, when the moth caterpillars are largest, and they are accompanied by their just fledged young. They search out holes and make some exploratory bites looking for larvae. If successful, they peel and tear down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing <b>to</b> <b>gouge</b> and excavate the larvae, which have deeply tunneled into the heartwood.|$|E
25|$|The {{increased}} use of more freely available credit changed the American economy, but not without creating some backlash. Consumer advocates complained that some issuers were using late fees of $5 or $10, charged if a single month's payment was even one day overdue, <b>to</b> <b>gouge</b> extra profits from customers who might otherwise be borrowing and spending responsibly. Laws in some states limited those fees, yet companies and banks continued to charge above those limits, claiming the late fees were a form of interest and thus {{not subject to the}} laws of those states {{as long as they were}} headquartered elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the start}} of Oedipus Rex, Oedipus has become the king of Thebes while unwittingly {{fulfilling}} a prophecy that he would kill his father, Laius (the previous king), and marry his mother, Jocasta (whom Oedipus took as his queen after solving the riddle of the Sphinx). The action of Sophocles' play concerns Oedipus' search for the murderer of Laius in order to end a plague ravaging Thebes, unaware that the killer he is looking for is none other than himself. At the end of the play, after the truth finally comes to light, Jocasta hangs herself while Oedipus, horrified at his patricide and incest, proceeds <b>to</b> <b>gouge</b> out his own eyes in despair.|$|E

25|$|In 1988, Hawk and Animal quietly turned {{heel and}} finally won the NWA World Tag Team Championship on October 29, 1988 in New Orleans, Louisiana {{at a house}} show against the Midnight Express, In November of that year the Road Warriors {{played a role in}} ending Dusty Rhodes' tenure as head booker for the promotion. During the November 26 episode of World Championship Wrestling, which was under strict {{instructions}} from TBS television executives prohibiting blading, the Road Warriors attacked Rhodes, removed a spike from their shoulder pads, and attempted <b>to</b> <b>gouge</b> his eye out. Rhodes was fired for that episode shortly after Starrcade '88. Before Rhodes was fired, Animal beat him at the Clash of the Champions, so the Road Warriors were allowed to pick a new partner to hold the NWA World Six-Man Tag Team titles; they picked AJPW superstar Genichiro Tenryu but the titles were quickly abandoned.|$|E
500|$|As a {{homologous}} {{structure in}} lemuriforms, the toothcomb serves variable biological roles, despite its superficially stereotypic shape and appearance. [...] It is primarily {{used as a}} toiletry device or grooming comb. [...] Additionally, some species use their toothcomb for food procurement or <b>to</b> <b>gouge</b> tree bark.|$|E
500|$|To {{communicate}} with smell, which is useful at night, lemurs will scent mark with urine {{as well as}} scent glands located on the wrists, inside elbow, genital regions, or the neck. The scrotal skin of most male lemurs has scent glands. Ruffed lemurs (genus Varecia) and male sifakas have a gland {{at the base of}} their neck, while the greater bamboo lemur (Prolemur simus) and the ring-tailed lemur have glands inside the upper arms near the axilla. Male ring-tailed lemurs also have scent glands on the inside of their forearms, adjacent to a thorn-like spur, which they use <b>to</b> <b>gouge,</b> and simultaneously, scent-mark tree branches. They will also wipe their tails between their forearms and then engage in [...] "stink fights" [...] by waving their tail at their opponents.|$|E

500|$|The silky sifaka uses {{well-developed}} olfactory (smell-based) communication, as {{with all}} other strepsirrhine primates. [...] Like other eastern rainforest sifakas, it has several specialized glands for scent-marking, including a sebaceous gland on the chest, found only in males, and mixed apocrine-sebaceous glands on the genitals in both sexes. Unlike the true lemurs of the genus Eulemur, the silky sifaka does not directly scent-mark its [...] (allomarking), although it does scent-mark its territory. [...] Both sexes will often urinate while scent-marking. [...] Males and females scent-mark in different ways: females rub their genital glands in an up-and-down motion against trees, while males may use their chest gland, genital glands, {{or a combination of}} both. Males also use their specialized toothcomb <b>to</b> <b>gouge</b> trees before scent-marking with their chest—a behavior that leaves long-lasting visible marks. [...] The gouging is thought to serve a role in communication and has no dietary component, since males do not eat the bark or tree gum.|$|E
500|$|The {{romantic and}} emotionally charged {{aspects of the}} film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of Urban Cinefile said, [...] "You will walk out of Titanic not talking about budget or running time, but of its {{enormous}} emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers <b>to</b> <b>gouge</b> into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly described the film as, [...] "A lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times commented that [...] "Cameron's magnificent Titanic is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to Gone With the Wind." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine, on the other hand, wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.|$|E

2500|$|Ackerman and his scriptwriters, Mort Fine and David Friedkin, {{created an}} {{audition}} script called [...] "Mark Dillon Goes <b>to</b> <b>Gouge</b> Eye" [...] {{based on one}} of their Michael Shayne radio scripts, [...] "The Crooked Wheel". Two auditions were created in 1949. The first was very much like a hardboiled detective series and starred Michael Rye (credited as Rye Billsbury) as Dillon; the second starred Straight Arrow actor Howard Culver in a more Western, lighter version of the same script. CBS liked the Culver version better, and Ackerman was told to proceed.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{versions}} of the same pilot episode titled [...] "Mark Dillon Goes <b>to</b> <b>Gouge</b> Eye" [...] are in the archives with two different actors, Rye Billsbury and Howard Culver, playing Marshal [...] "Mark" [...] Dillon as the lead, not yet played by Conrad. Conrad {{was one of the last}} actors to audition for the role of Marshal Dillon. With a resonantly powerful and distinctive voice, Conrad was already one of radio's busiest actors. Though Meston championed him, Macdonnell thought Conrad might be overexposed. During his audition, however, Conrad won over Macdonnell after reading only a few lines. Dillon as portrayed by Conrad was a lonely, isolated man, toughened by a hard life. Macdonnell later claimed, [...] "Much of Matt Dillon's character grew out of Bill Conrad." ...|$|E
2500|$|From the {{classical}} antiquity of Greece and Rome into the Colonial period, rape along with arson, treason and murder was a capital offense. [...] "Those committing rape {{were subject to}} a wide range of capital punishments that were seemingly brutal, frequently bloody, and at times spectacular." [...] In the 12th century, kinsmen of the victim were given the option of executing the punishment themselves. [...] "In England in the early fourteenth century, a victim of rape might be expected <b>to</b> <b>gouge</b> out the eyes and/or sever the offender's testicles herself." [...] Despite the harshness of these laws, actual punishments were usually far less severe: in late Medieval Europe, cases concerning rapes of marriageable women, wives, widows, or members of the lower class were rarely brought forward, and usually ended with only a small monetary fine or a marriage between the victim and the rapist. In the 15 and 16th centuries, rape in the Basque charters (Enkarterri, Durangaldea) was punished with death for the offender and the person who was helping him.|$|E
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of last year’s hurricane season, questions arose regarding increased prices in the areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma and {{the effect that the}} damage caused by the hurricanes would have on prices, specifically gasoline prices, {{in other parts of the}} country. As gasoline prices have continued to rise in the months since, Congress has considered legislation addressing gasoline and oil prices that includes provisions related <b>to</b> price <b>gouging.</b> The House has recently passed two bills that include a federal prohibition on price gouging (H.

2500|$|In {{describing}} his victims, Chikatilo falsely {{referred to them}} as [...] " [...] elements" [...] whom he would lure to secluded areas before killing. In many instances, particularly (though not exclusively) with his male victims, Chikatilo stated he would bind the victims' hands behind their back with a length of rope before he would proceed to kill them. He would typically inflict a multitude of knife wounds upon the victim; initially inflicting shallow knife wounds to the chest area before inflicting deeper stab and slash wounds—usually 30 to 50 in total—before proceeding to eviscerate the victim. He had, he stated, become adept at avoiding the spurts of blood from his victims' bodies as he inflicted the knife wounds and eviscerations upon them, and would regularly sit or squat beside his victims until their hearts had stopped beating, adding that the victims' [...] "cries, the blood and the agony gave me relaxation and a certain pleasure." [...] When questioned as to why most of his later victims' eyes had been stabbed and/or slashed, but not enucleated as his earlier victims had been, Chikatilo stated that he had initially believed in an old superstition {{that the image of}} a murderer is left imprinted upon the eyes of the victim. However, he stated, in [...] "later years", he had become convinced this was simply an old wives' tale and he had ceased <b>to</b> <b>gouge</b> out the eyes of his victims.|$|E

During exercise walks he was granted in the prison garret, he found a piece of black marble and an iron bar which he smuggled back to his cell; he hid the bar inside his armchair. When he was temporarily without cell mates, he spent two weeks sharpening the bar into a spike on the stone. Then he began <b>to</b> <b>gouge</b> through the wooden floor underneath his bed, knowing that his cell was directly above the Inquisitor's chamber. Just three days before his intended escape, during a festival when no officials would be in the chamber below, Casanova was moved to a larger, lighter cell with a view, despite his protests that he was perfectly happy where he was.
