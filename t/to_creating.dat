50|$|Interconnected {{networks}} are {{more efficient than}} discrete channels, but are harder and more expensive <b>to</b> <b>create.</b> The most basic way <b>to</b> <b>create</b> these channels is to apply basic machining principles <b>to</b> <b>create</b> micro scale channel grooves. These techniques yield channels from 600-700 micrometers. This technique works great on the two-dimensional plane, but when trying <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a three-dimensional network, they are limited.|$|R

Following the group's dissolution, Gotye turned his interest <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> sample-based electronic music; he sent out demo tapes of his music to several Australian radio stations. In 2002, he formed the indie pop band The Basics with fellow singer-songwriter Kris Schroeder. Gotye later signed to Creative Vibes as a solo artist and released his debut studio album Boardface in June 2003.|$|E

The book's images became a guide <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> the overall look of the film after Schliessler had shown them to Berg, as well as the art and costume departments. Prior to filming, Schleissler and Berg shot test footage with the digital cameras and brought it to digital colorist Stefan Sonnenfeld at post-production facility Company 3 for color grading.|$|E

5|$|Following popular {{television}} {{appearances and}} concerts during their February 1964 visit, the Beatles {{returned to the}} United States in August 1964, and again in August 1965, for tours. In August 1966 they returned once more, and although this tour was commercially successful, it coincided with a storm of U.S. public protest after publication of a quote from John Lennon's remarks about Christianity. The 1966 U.S. tour {{marked the end of}} the Beatles' concert days. The band ceased to perform commercial concerts, instead devoting their efforts <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> new material in the recording studio.|$|E
5|$|From {{the moment}} Thriller was released, it set the {{standard}} for the music industry: artists, record labels, producers, marketers and even choreographers. The music video was ahead of its time and it is considered a monumental one—not only in Jackson's career, but also in the history of pop music. Epic Records' approach <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> a song and video that would appeal to the mass market ended up influencing the way that professionals now market and release their songs. John Landis's production of a mini-movie, rather than the usual short music video, would raise the bar for other directors and producers.|$|E

He also re-used other elements pioneered in The Broken Ear {{in his later}} Adventures: a parrot in The Castafiore Emerald, a ravine crash in The Calculus Affair, a fireball and vivid dream in The Seven Crystal Balls, and a firing squad in Tintin and the Picaros. Tintin returned to San Theodores in Tintin and the Picaros, in which the characters Pablo and Ridgewell also made a reappearance.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} inaugural speech in August 1816, Jennings called {{attention}} to the need for an educational plan. In his 1817 annual message to the state legislature, he encouraged the establishment of a free, state-funded education system, as called for in the state constitution, but few of the state's citizens were willing to impose taxes to fund public schools. The state legislature believed priority should be given <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> government infrastructure. Lack of public funds postponed creation of a state library system until Governor James B. Ray's administration in 1826.|$|E
5|$|In the {{traditional}} cottage garden, hedges served as fences {{on the perimeter}} to keep out marauding livestock and for privacy, along with other practical uses. Hawthorn leaves made a tasty snack or tea, while the flowers were used for making wine. The fast-growing Elderberry, in addition <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> a hedge, provided berries for food and wine, with the flowers being fried in batter or made into lotions and ointments. The wood had many uses, including toys, pegs, skewers, and fishing poles. Holly was another hedge plant, useful because it quickly spread and self-seeded. Privet was also a convenient and fast-growing hedge. Over time, more ornamental and less utilitarian plants became popular cottage garden hedges, including laurel, lilac, snowberry, japonica, and others.|$|E
5|$|Simulating the geodynamo {{requires}} numerically {{solving a}} set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of the Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> kinematic dynamo computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and {{the effect on the}} magnetic field calculated. Kinematic dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo.|$|E

5|$|The Beatles' {{arrival in}} the United States in 1964 marked the spread of Beatlemania from the UK to the wider world, {{established}} the group's international stature, and, triggering the British Invasion, caused changes in U.S. popular culture. The Candlestick Park concert {{at the close of}} the 1966 U.S. tour marked the end of a four-year period dominated by touring and concerts, including nearly sixty U.S. appearances, and over one thousand four hundred internationally. The Beatles, from the end of their 1966 U.S. tour until their break-up in 1970, gave no further commercial concerts, instead devoting their efforts <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> new material in the recording studio.|$|E
5|$|The Triumph of Cleopatra {{illustrates}} {{a scene from}} Plutarch's Life of Antony and Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, in which Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, travels to Tarsus in Cilicia aboard a magnificently decorated ship to cement an alliance with the Roman general Mark Antony. An intentionally cramped and crowded composition, it shows a huge {{group of people in}} various states of undress, gathering on the bank to watch the ship's arrival. Although not universally admired in the press, the painting was an immediate success, making Etty famous almost overnight. Buoyed by its reception, Etty devoted much of the next decade <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> further history paintings containing nude figures, becoming renowned for his combination of nudity and moral messages.|$|E

50|$|There {{is no one}} defined way <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a vexel, however, one archetypal way <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a vexel follows. Instead {{of using}} vector-based lines, shapes, and polygons <b>to</b> <b>create</b> an image, a vexel is {{typically}} created using a raster program's support for transparent layers. Each transparent layer is given a solid (or sometimes gradient) shape and a display ordering that when displayed together with other near shape layers appears <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a stepped-but-gradual color transition. In some cases, for more realism, gradients are used that remove the stepping in the color transitions <b>to</b> <b>create</b> a smoother, photo-realistic image.|$|R

That the child may be happy is not a morally important reason <b>to</b> <b>create</b> it. By contrast, that the child may be unhappy is an important moral reason <b>to</b> not <b>create</b> it.
