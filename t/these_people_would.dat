5|$|ATLs {{story is}} {{loosely based on}} {{material}} by producers Dallas Austin and Tionne Watkins, who set out to describe their experiences growing up {{on the south side}} of Atlanta in the early '90s. Watkins and producer Jody Gerson approached James Lassiter with the idea of a story about a skating rink that many involved in the Atlanta music scene had started at, and how all of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> attend the rink every Sunday night in their teen years.|$|E
5|$|In Serbia, men {{believed}} to possess properties of an ala were called aloviti (ala-like) men, {{and they were}} given several explanations. An ala may have sneaked into them; these were recognized by their voracity, because the ala, {{in order to satisfy}} her excessive hunger, drove them to eat incessantly. They may also have survived an ala blowing on them– an ala’s breath is usually lethal to humans. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> then become exceptionally strong. Alternatively, they could be the offspring of an ala and a woman, or could have been born covered with the caul. It was believed that aloviti men could not be killed with a gun or arrow, unless gold or silver was used.|$|E
25|$|Such {{blurring}} {{of the senses}} was also {{a factor in the}} practice of spirit intermediaries, or mediumship. Practitioners of the art would fall into trances or dance to perform supernatural tasks. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> often rise to power {{as a result of their}} art—Luan Da, a Han dynasty medium, was granted rule over 2,000 households. Noted Han historian Sima Qian was scornful of such practices, dismissing them as foolish trickery.|$|E
50|$|While {{initially}} Arian Christians {{like other}} Gothic peoples, the Crimean Goths had fully {{integrated with the}} Trinitarian Roman Church by the 6th century. Following the split of the Church, <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>would</b> remain loyal to Constantinople {{as part of the}} Eastern Orthodox Church. In the 8th century John of Gothia, an Orthodox bishop, led an unsuccessful revolt against Khazar overlordship.|$|R

50|$|By 550, {{the region}} was {{controlled}} by native Brittonic-speaking peoples except for the eastern coastal areas, which were controlled by the Anglian peoples of Bernicia and Deira. To the north were the Picts (now also accepted as Brittonic speakers), themselves also called Manau with the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata to the northwest. All of <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>would</b> {{play a role in}} the history of the Old North.|$|R
25|$|Before 1917, the Russian {{architectural}} {{scene was}} divided between Russky Modern (a local interpretation of Art Nouveau, stronger in Moscow), and Neoclassical Revival (stronger in Saint Petersburg). The Neoclassical school produced mature architects like Alexey Shchusev, Ivan Zholtovsky, Ivan Fomin, Vladimir Shchuko and Alexander Tamanian; {{by the time}} of the Revolution they were established professionals, with their own companies, schools and followers. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> eventually become Stalinism's architectural elders and produce the best examples of the period.|$|E
25|$|Blennerhassett Phase of the Fort Ancient Tradition appears by 1250 CE. These people {{extend from}} the Mouth of the Little Kanawha area {{and began a}} few centuries before the Orchard people appear. They no longer {{utilized}} small burial mounds. The graves are now found amongst the houses surrounding the central plaza. Houses tended to be rectangular with round corners or oval in shape and were semi-subterranean with compacted floors. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> become adept in palisading their circular villages with logs. This period shows a marked increase in maize diet than the earlier domesticated grasses or cereals of the preceding hamlet farmer. They continued to hunt small mammals, birds, fish, mollusks, elk, and white-tail deer. They follow the Roseberry Phase (Brose et al. 2001:70,85. CE 1050-1250) also northly from the Great Kanawha.|$|E
25|$|After their {{experiences}} at the Eastern Front, having learned about mass murder in Poland and Russia, Hans Scholl and Alexander Schmorell {{felt compelled to}} take action. From end of June until mid of July 1942, they wrote the first four leaflets. Quoting extensively from the Bible, Aristotle and Novalis, as well as Goethe and Schiller, the iconic poets of German bourgeoisie, they appealed to what they considered the German intelligentsia, believing that <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be easily convinced by the same arguments that also motivated the authors themselves. These leaflets were left in telephone books in public phone booths, mailed to professors and students, and taken by courier to other universities for distribution. From 23 July to 30 October 1942, Graf, Scholl and Schmorell served again at the Russian front, and activities ceased until their return. In autumn 1942, Sophie Scholl discovered that her brother Hans {{was one of the}} authors of the pamphlets, and joined the group. Shortly after, Willi Graf, and by the end of December 1942, Kurt Huber became members of the White Rose.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} {{inhabitants of}} the territory that is now Maine were Algonquian-speaking Wabanaki peoples, including the Passamaquoddy, Maliseet, Penobscot, Kennebec and Androscoggin. During the later King Phillip's War, many of <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>would</b> merge {{in one form or}} another to become the Wabanaki Confederacy, aiding the Wampanoag of Massachusetts & the Mahican of New York. Afterwards, many of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were driven from their natural territories, but most of the tribes of Maine continued, unchanged, until the American Revolution. Before this point, however, most of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> were considered separate nations. Many had adapted to living in permanent, Iroquois inspired settlements, while those along the coast tended to be semi-nomadic-- traveling from settlement to settlement on a yearly cycle. They would usually winter inland & head to the coasts by summer.|$|R
25|$|On the peninsula, {{the effects}} of the {{continued}} contacts between the non-Malays with Malay-dominated centre is suggested in a 19th-century account of Pahang, which mentions that some of the natives who had strong trading ties with the Malays had begun to emulate their speech and dress. The population of Pattani also has been described as partly aboriginal in origin. In the case of Johor, the aboriginal people who were reported in the 19th century to be speaking Aslian languages, were called 'Malay' a century later. It has been suggested that <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> probably have joined the Jakun first before becoming Malay. The Jakun are described as being similar to Malays in their kinship arrangements, but resistant to aspects of social structure as well as the Islamic religion of the Malays. In 17th century Cambodia, a polity renowned for its Buddhism, king Ramathipadi I converted to Islam, took the name Muhammad Ibrahim, married a Malay Muslim of a princely Cham family, had his courtiers wear krisses and used Malay language in correspondence. During the same century in Champa, a once powerful Indianized polity but by that time retreating before the advancing Vietnamese, the rulers held the title Paduka Seri Sultan which is so common in the Malay polities. These rulers were in close contact with the peninsula, in particular Kelantan. French missionaries reported the presence of scribes and religious scholars from Kelantan right into the 19th century. It was believed that Kelantanese who eventually helped to give the Cham struggle against the Vietnamese, the character of a religious crusade.|$|E
500|$|Rothbard {{called for}} the {{elimination}} of [...] "the entire 'civil rights' structure" [...] stating that it [...] "tramples on the property rights of every American." [...] He consistently favored repeal of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, including Title VII regarded employment discrimination and called for overturning the Brown v. Board of Education decision on the grounds that forced integration of schools was aggressive. In an essay called [...] "right-wing populism", Rothbard proposed a set of measures to [...] "reach out" [...] to the [...] "middle and working classes", which included urging the police to crack down on [...] "street criminals", writing that [...] "cops must be unleashed" [...] and [...] "allowed to administer instant punishment, subject of course to liability when they are in error". He also advocated that the police [...] "clear the streets of bums and vagrants", and quipped [...] "who cares?," [...] in response to the question of where <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> go after being removed from public property.|$|E

2500|$|Nachman of Breslov also {{believed}} that Jewishness is a level of consciousness, and not an intrinsic inborn quality. He wrote that, according to the Book of Malachi, one can find [...] "potential Jews" [...] among all nations, whose souls are illuminated by the leap of [...] "holy faith", which [...] "activated" [...] the Jewishness in their soul. <b>These</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> otherwise convert to Judaism, but prefer not to do so.

2500|$|Jeckeln {{then went}} to Riga and {{explained}} the situation to Lohse, who raised no further objection. [...] By mid-November 1941, Jeckeln had set himself up in a building in the old section of Riga known as the Ritterhaus. [...] Back in Berlin, Rosenberg, Lohse's superior in the Nazi hierarchy, {{was able to get}} one concession out of Himmler, that slave labor extracted from male Jews aged 16–60 would be considered too important to Germany's war effort. [...] Consequently, <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> be spared, while women, children, old and disabled people would be shot.

50|$|The {{houses were}} usually divided into a kitchen, a living room, a porch and a bedroom.

2500|$|Slaves in America {{had many}} musical traditions that became {{important}} {{to the music of}} the country, particularly jazz. The work song was one of these traditions, an improvised system of singing based on the idea of call and response, a central aspect of African music. There were also several instrumental improvisation techniques that were used: after work was done, <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> hold musical performances in which they played on pseudo-instruments made of washtubs and other objects newly used for musical purposes, and also played rhythms on their bodies, called [...] "pattin' juba". The only area that slaves were allowed to perform their music, other than private locations, was a place in New Orleans called Congo Square.|$|E
2500|$|The {{architectural}} {{character of}} many of the terraces in Chinatown is much more Italianate in style than those of, for instance Emerald Hill or Petain Road. [...] Windows often appear as mere slits with narrow timber jalousies (often with adjustable slats). Fanlights over the windows are usually quite decorative and the pilasters and balconies and even the plasterwork and colours seem to be Mediterranean in flavour. The style was probably introduced by those early Chinese immigrants (both China-born and Straits-born) who had knowledge of the Portuguese architecture of Macau, Malacca and Goa. The Chettiars and Tamils from Southern India would also have been familiar with the European architecture there, although {{it is difficult to imagine}} how <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> have had a particularly strong influence on building in Chinatown.|$|E
2500|$|Irish monasticism was {{notable for}} its permeability. In {{permeable}} monasticism, people {{were able to}} move freely {{in and out of}} the monastic system at different points of life. Young boys and girls would enter the system to pursue Latin scholarship. [...] Students would sometimes travel from faraway lands to enter the Irish monasteries. When these students became adults, they would leave the monastery to live out their lives. Eventually, <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> retire back to secure community provided by the monastery and stay until their death. However, some would stay within the monastery and become leaders. Since most of the clergy were Irish, native traditions were well-respected. Permeable monasticism popularised the use of vernacular and helped mesh the norms of secular and monastic element in Ireland, unlike other parts of Europe where monasteries were more isolated. Examples of these intertwining motifs can be seen in the hagiographies of St. Brigid and St. Columba.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, {{every town}} rabbi {{had the right}} to {{maintain}} a number of full-time or part-time pupils in the town's beth midrash (study hall, usually adjacent to the synagogue).

The largest ethnic groups (by ancestry) among White Americans were Germans, followed by Irish and English. In the 1980 census 49,598,035 Americans cited that they were of English ancestry, making them 26% of the country and the largest group at the time, and in fact larger than the population of England itself. Slightly more than half of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> cite that they were of [...] "American" [...] ancestry on subsequent censuses and virtually everywhere that [...] "American" [...] ancestry predominates on the 2000 census corresponds to places where [...] "English" [...] predominated on the 1980 census.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with other}} social movements, {{there is also}} {{conflict}} within and between LGBT movements, especially about strategies for change and debates over exactly who represents the constituency of these movements, and this also applies to changing education. There is debate over what extent lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersexed people, and others share common interests and a need to work together. [...] Leaders of the lesbian and gay movement of the 1970s, 80s and 90s often attempted to hide masculine lesbians, feminine gay men, transgender people, and bisexuals from the public eye, creating internal divisions within LGBT communities. Roffee and Waling (2016) discovered that LGBTIQ people experience microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours from other people within the LGBTIQ community. This is due to misconceptions and conflicting views as to what entails [...] "LGBTIQ". For example, transgender people found that {{other members of the}} community were not understanding to their own, individual, specific needs and would instead make ignorant assumptions, and this can cause health risks. [...] Additionally, bisexual people found that lesbian or gay people were not understanding or appreciative of the bisexual sexuality. Evidently, even though most of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>would</b> say that they stand for the same values as the majority of the community, there are still remaining inconsistencies even within the LGBTIQ community.|$|E
