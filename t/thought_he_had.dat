5|$|Earp and Behan both {{applied to}} fill the new {{position}} of Cochise County sheriff, which like the Pima County sheriff job, paid the office holder 10% of the fees and taxes collected. Earp <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{a good chance to}} win the position because he was the former undersheriff in the region and a Republican, like Arizona Territorial Governor John C. Fremont. However, Behan had greater political experience and influence in Prescott.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010 NBA Development League Draft, held on November 1, Rolle {{was chosen}} {{with the third}} overall pick by the Maine Red Claws. The Red Claws were the {{affiliated}} team of the Boston Celtics and the Charlotte Bobcats. According to Red Claws general manager Jon Jennings, several D-League teams <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the most upside of anyone on the draft.|$|E
5|$|As he {{indicated}} in the title, Kepler <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about {{the connection between the}} physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.|$|E

6000|$|... "Pardi! {{tell us your}} 'but' citizen," [...] said Tinville, for the coal-heaver had paused, as {{if trying}} to collect his <b>thoughts.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> dragged a wine barrel to collect his <b>thoughts.</b> <b>He</b> <b>had</b> dragged a wine barrel close to the trestle table, and now sat astride upon it, facing Tinville and the group of Jacobins. The {{flickering}} tallow candle behind him threw into bold silhouette his square, massive head, crowned with its Phrygian cap, and the great breadth of his shoulders, with the shabby knitted spencer and low, turned-down collar.|$|R
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E
5|$|Born on July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Indiana, Richard Skelton was {{the fourth}} and {{youngest}} son of Ida Mae (née Fields) and Joseph Elmer Skelton. Joseph, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; {{he had once been}} a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. During Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, Skelton may have claimed he was older than he actually was in order to gain employment. Vincennes neighbors described the Skelton family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend remembered that her parents broke up a youthful romance between her sister and Skelton because they <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no future.|$|E
5|$|The {{golden goal}} was used during extra-time, {{which meant that}} {{whatever}} team scored first would win. Liverpool kicked off {{the first half of}} extra-time and within three minutes, Alavés looked like they had scored a golden goal. Ivan Alonso had put the ball in the Liverpool goal, but it was ruled out as Alonso was offside. A minute later, Óscar Téllez was booked for fouling Robbie Fowler. Within four minutes, Alavés had been reduced to 10 men. Magno was shown a second yellow card for a two-footed challenge on Markus Babbel. With a minute {{of the first half of}} extra-time remaining, Fowler <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> scored the winning goal, however it was disallowed as he was offside.|$|E
50|$|Much {{like his}} {{academic}} teacher Konrad Hesse, Häberle {{stands in the}} tradition of the Rudolf Smend school of <b>thought.</b> <b>He</b> <b>has</b> publicly acknowledged this fact in a lot of his works.|$|R

5|$|U-9, {{commanded}} by Kapitänleutnant Otto Weddigen, {{had been ordered}} to attack British transports at Ostend, but {{had been forced to}} dive and take shelter from the storm. On surfacing, she spotted the British ships and moved to attack. She fired one torpedo at 06:20 at Aboukir which struck her on the starboard side; the ship's captain <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> struck a mine and ordered the other two ships to close to transfer his wounded men. Aboukir quickly began listing and capsized around 06:55 despite counterflooding compartments on the opposite side to right her.|$|E
5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 89,102, Ramires put Chelsea in front in the 11th minute after he {{disposed}} Liverpool midfielder Jay Spearing and beat Pepe Reina in the Liverpool area. They extended their lead in the 52nd minute when striker Didier Drogba scored. Liverpool substitute Andy Carroll scored in the 64th minute {{to reduce the deficit}} to one goal. Carroll <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> scored a second in the 81st minute, but his header was saved on the line by Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Čech. Carroll ran off celebrating, as he thought the ball had crossed, but referee Phil Dowd did not award the goal and Chelsea held on to win the match 2–1.|$|E
5|$|When Mardonius' raids {{disrupted}} the Allied supply chain, it forced the Allies {{to rethink their}} strategy. Rather than now moving to attack, however, they instead looked to retreat and secure their lines of communication. Despite this defensive move by the Greeks, {{it was in fact}} the chaos resulting from this retreat that finally ended the stalemate. Mardonius perceived this as a full-on retreat, in effect thinking that the battle was already over, and sought to pursue the Greeks. Since he did not expect the Greeks to fight, the tactical problems were no longer an issue and he tried {{to take advantage of the}} altered strategic situation he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> produced. Conversely, the Greeks had, inadvertently, lured Mardonius into attacking them on the higher ground and, despite being outnumbered, were thus at a tactical advantage.|$|E

5|$|Casualties {{were heavy}} on both sides, and both vessels were in such poor {{condition}} that each commander <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> sunk his opponent. Most of La Vengeance rigging {{had been blown}} away; only the lower foremast, lower mizzenmast, and bowsprit were operational. Pitot set course for Curaçao {{and was forced to}} ground his vessel there to prevent her from sinking. The number of French casualties is somewhat unclear: official French accounts report 28 dead and 40 wounded, while accounts from Curaçao state that the French frigate had lost 160 men. Once Pitot reached Curaçao he was beset with further problems. La Vengeance remained out of action for months due to difficulties in acquiring support needed to repair the frigate from the Dutch officials there. A French expedition to seize the island brought the materiel needed to repair the frigate, but when asked to help attack the island Pitot refused and slipped away to Guadaloupe.|$|E
5|$|Celestial bodies {{interior}} to {{the orbit}} of Mercury have been hypothesized, and searched for, for centuries. The German astronomer Christoph Scheiner <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen small bodies passing {{in front of the}} Sun in 1611, but these were later shown to be sunspots. In the 1850s, Urbain Le Verrier made detailed calculations of Mercury's orbit and found a small discrepancy in the planet's perihelion precession from predicted values. He postulated that the gravitational influence of a small planet or ring of asteroids within {{the orbit of}} Mercury would explain the deviation. Shortly afterward, an amateur astronomer named Edmond Lescarbault claimed to have seen Le Verrier's proposed planet transit the Sun. The new planet was quickly named Vulcan but was never seen again, and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury's orbit was explained by Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915. The vulcanoids take their name from this hypothetical planet. What Lescarbault saw was probably another sunspot.|$|E
5|$|Despite Kỳ and Đức's media event, it {{appeared}} that Phát and Ton were remaining defiant after returning to the latter's 7th Division's headquarters in Mỹ Tho. Ton was apparently still maintaining a hostile political stance, and threatening {{to break away from}} the Saigon regime by overseeing the area around Mỹ Tho as a virtual independent state. Ton was reported to have threatened to cut the main highway from Saigon into Mỹ Tho and further south into the rest of the Mekong Delta, although it was <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no intention or means of assaulting Saigon militarily. Kỳ said a helicopter had been sent to arrest Ton but that a stand-off had developed. However, on September 16 Khánh had the plotters taken into custody. Đức, the rebel tank commander Nghia, Ton, and Lam were all arrested, followed by Phát, who returned to Saigon to turn himself in. A trial was then scheduled. Khánh removed three of the four corps commanders and six of the nine division commanders for failing to move against Phát and Đức.|$|E

5|$|Lucan's {{disappearance}} has captivated the public's imagination for decades, {{with thousands}} of sightings reported across the world. One of the earliest, shortly after the murder, {{turned out to be}} a British ex-politician, John Stonehouse, who had attempted to fake his own death. The police travelled to France in June the following year to hunt another lead, to no avail. A sighting in Colombia {{turned out to be a}}n American businessman. John Miller, a bounty hunter who kidnapped the fugitive train robber Ronnie Biggs, claimed in 1982 to have captured the earl, but was later exposed by the News of the World as a hoaxer. In 2003 a former Scotland Yard detective <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> tracked the earl to Goa, India; the man he traced was actually Barry Halpin, a folk singer from StHelens. In 2007, reporters in New Zealand interviewed a homeless British expatriate who neighbours claimed was the missing earl.|$|E
5|$|McCall played {{football}} for Upper Wortley Primary School and Thornhill Middle School, even scoring a winning {{goal for the}} latter in a cup final when he came on as a substitute with his arm in a sling. While McCall also played table tennis as a schoolboy, football was a focus, and he captained the Leeds under-11 boys team and played for other Leeds representative sides. McCall's parents split and he made up for his size {{when he moved to}} one of Leeds' toughest estates and played for pub sides by the age of 14. He moved schools to Harrington High and also played for local young sides Pudsey Juniors, Holbeck and later Farsley Celtic. McCall <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> missed his chance of playing professionally after a string of other players were signed by professional clubs, until Farsley played Bradford City's junior side in a friendly and he impressed coach Bryan Edwards enough to be asked for a trial.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 1940, a {{train with}} workers from Trondheim {{to the airport}} {{collided}} with the local train from Kopperå just east of Hommelvik Station. The Hommelvik train disaster killed 22 people. The trains {{were supposed to have}} passed at Homnmelvik Station, but the engineer <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen the other train, and had left the station. The accident occurred at 08:03, and was caused by there being virtually no light to see with, since all outdoor sources of light were covered. On 23 January 1941, a coke and coal train from Sweden lost its braking between the border and Kopperå. The six back cars plus the caboose derailed just west of Kopperå Station, while the locomotive and 17 other trains continued their wild flight. The train derailed at Meråker Station, and the Meråker train disaster killed both the engineer and the stoker.|$|E
50|$|In Pawling, Tabaud pleased {{friends and}} neighbors by drawing their portraits, free of charge. Whole days and evenings were spent reading the works of {{philosophers}} whose <b>thoughts</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> long wished to examine but had never {{had the time to}} do so before.|$|R

5|$|The first {{mention of}} rings around Neptune {{dates back to}} 1846 when William Lassell, the {{discoverer}} of Neptune's largest moon, Triton, <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen a ring around the planet. However, his claim was never confirmed {{and it is likely}} that it was an observational artifact. The first reliable detection of a ring was made in 1968 by stellar occultation, although that result would go unnoticed until 1977 when the rings of Uranus were discovered. Soon after the Uranus discovery, a team from Villanova University led by Harold J. Reitsema began searching for rings around Neptune. On 24 May 1981, they detected a dip in a star's brightness during one occultation; however, {{the manner in which the}} star dimmed did not suggest a ring. Later, after the Voyager fly-by, it was found that the occultation was due to the small Neptunian moon Larissa, a highly unusual event.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} moons to be {{discovered}} were Titania and Oberon, which were spotted by Sir William Herschel on January 11, 1787, six years after he had discovered the planet itself. Later, Herschel <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> discovered up to six moons (see below) and perhaps even a ring. For nearly 50years, Herschel's instrument {{was the only one}} with which the moons had been seen. In the 1840s, better instruments and a more favorable position of Uranus in the sky led to sporadic indications of satellites additional to Titania and Oberon. Eventually, the next two moons, Ariel and Umbriel, were discovered by William Lassell in 1851. The Roman numbering scheme of Uranus's moons {{was in a state of}} flux for a considerable time, and publications hesitated between Herschel's designations (where Titania and Oberon are Uranus II and IV) and William Lassell's (where they are sometimes I and II). With the confirmation of Ariel and Umbriel, Lassell numbered the moons I through IV from Uranus outward, and this finally stuck. In 1852, Herschel's son John Herschel gave the four then-known moons their names.|$|E
5|$|The role of Walter Skinner {{was played}} by actor Mitch Pileggi, who had unsuccessfully auditioned {{for two or}} three other {{characters}} on The X-Files before getting the part. At first, {{the fact that he was}} asked back to audition for the recurring role slightly puzzled him, until he discovered the reason he had not previously been cast in those roles — Chris Carter had been unable to envision Pileggi as any of those characters, due to the fact that the actor had been shaving his head. When the actor had attended the audition for Walter Skinner, he had been in a grumpy mood and had allowed his small amount of hair to grow back. Pileggi's attitude fit well with Walter Skinner's character, causing Carter to assume that the actor was only pretending to be grumpy. After successfully auditioning for the role, Pileggi <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been lucky that he had not been cast in one of the earlier roles, as he believed he would have appeared in only a single episode and would have missed the opportunity to play the recurring role of Walter Skinner.|$|E
