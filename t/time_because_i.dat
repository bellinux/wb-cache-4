500|$|Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was {{the soul}} music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975). He {{considered}} it the least satisfactory {{of the three}} he had recorded since All Things Must Pass. Leng identified [...] "bitterness and dismay" [...] {{in many of the}} album's tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: [...] "He wasn't up for it... It was a terrible <b>time</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> think {{there was a lot of}} cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture... I didn't like his frame of mind". He released two singles from the LP: [...] "You", which reached the Billboard top 20, and [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", Apple's final original single release.|$|E
500|$|She later {{described}} {{this period of}} her life to Essence saying [...] "People {{need to understand that}} the Lauryn Hill they were exposed to in the beginning was all that was allowed in that arena at that time… I had to step away when I realized that {{for the sake of the}} machine, I was being way too compromised. I felt uncomfortable about having to smile in someone's face when I really didn't like them or even know them well enough to like them." [...] She also spoke about her emotional crisis, saying, [...] "For two or three years I was away from all social interaction. It was a very introspective <b>time</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had to confront my fears and master every demonic thought about inferiority, about insecurity or the fear of being black, young and gifted in this western culture." [...] She went on to say that she had to fight to retain her identity, and was forced [...] "to deal with folks who weren't happy about that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thiel {{initially}} supported Carly Fiorina campaign {{during the}} 2016 GOP presidential primary elections. After Fiorina dropped out, Thiel supported Donald Trump {{and became one}} of the pledged California delegates for Trump's nomination at the 2016 Republican National Convention. He was also a headline speaker during the convention, during which he announced that he was [...] "proud to be gay". On October 15, 2016, Thiel announced a $1.25 million donation in support of Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Thiel stated to The New York Times: [...] "I didn’t give him any money for a long <b>time</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn’t think it mattered, and then the campaign asked me to." [...] After Trump's victory, Thiel was named to the executive committee of the President-elect's transition team.|$|E

5000|$|The song {{features}} an echo vocal with {{an arrangement of}} orchestra by Bill Shepherd. This song was recorded in IBC Studios on 15 February and finished on 20 February with [...] "The Victim", [...] "Moonlight" [...] and [...] "Summer Ends". [...] "It's not the same orchestra as we used with the Bee Gees", Gibb explained, [...] "But Bill Shepherd is the only arranger I'll ever work with. On the single Kiss Your Memory' I double-tracked my voice seven <b>times,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> knew exactly how I wanted everything done." ...|$|R
2500|$|At the 2005 London Marathon, Radcliffe {{won with}} a time of 2:17:42, a world's best time for a women's only race by over a minute. The race is remembered for a notorious moment towards the end when Radcliffe, {{hindered}} by runner's diarrhea and in need for a toilet break, stopped and defecated {{on the side of the}} road in view of the crowd and TV cameras which broadcast the incident live. After the race, she apologised to viewers and explained what happened, [...] "I was losing <b>time</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was having stomach cramps and I thought 'I just need to go and I'll be fine'. I didn't really want to resort to that in front of hundreds of thousands of people. Basically I needed to go. I started feeling it between 15 and [...] and probably carried on too long before stopping. I must have eaten too much beforehand". In November 2006, the incident was voted top running moment in history in the UK from a choice of ten [...] "unforgettable moments".|$|E
2500|$|Powell {{returned}} to novel writing {{and began to}} ponder a long novel sequence. Over the next 30 years, he produced his major work: A Dance to the Music of Time. Its twelve novels have been acclaimed by such critics as A. N. Wilson and fellow writers including Evelyn Waugh and Kingsley Amis as among the finest English fiction of the twentieth century. Auberon Waugh dissented, calling it [...] "tedious and overpraised—particularly by literary hangers-on". [...] Long-time friend V. S. Naipaul cast similar doubts regarding the work, if not the Powell oeuvre. Naipaul described his sentiments after a long-delayed review of Powell's work following the author's death this way: [...] "it may be that our friendship lasted all this <b>time</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had not examined his work". [...] While often compared to Proust, others find the comparison [...] "obvious, although superficial." [...] Its narrator's voice is more like the participant-observer of The Great Gatsby than that of Proust's self-regarding narrator. [...] Powell was awarded the 1957 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for the fourth volume, At Lady Molly's. The eleventh volume, Temporary Kings, received the W. H. Smith Prize in 1974. The cycle of novels, narrated by a protagonist with experiences and perspectives similar to Powell's own, follows the trajectory of the author's own life, offering a vivid portrayal of the intersection of bohemian life with high society between 1921 and 1971.|$|E
2500|$|According to Duff, {{the album}} chronicles her {{experiences}} {{over the year}} before its release: [...] "some of its good, {{and some of its}} bad, and a lot of its, like, a big learning experience", she explained. She expressed an interest in recording lyrically more aggressive material ("Well, I'm not going to be singing about lollipops because I no longer relate to lollipops") than the songs on Metamorphosis (2003) and wanted the album to reflect that, according to her, she is a normal sixteen-year-old. [...] "Basically, I'm not Lizzie McGuire anymore", she said. She said the album deals with issues she would not discuss publicly and provides [...] "some answers", but she disagreed with people who believed the album presented a different side of her, saying [...] "I think it's just more me this <b>time</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> got to really do it how I wanted to." [...] Duff called the album [...] "different [...] " [...] Metamorphosis and [...] "much more mature", particularly in its [...] "sound", but not {{to the point where it}} would be inappropriate for children; [...] "I just think that other people will relate better", she said. According to her, she was more [...] "involved" [...] compared to the production of her first album and [...] "confident enough to make suggestions" [...] about the style of the album: [...] "If I thought it needed to be more heavy, more rock, I said so". Its US release date, October 4, 2004, was a week after Duff's seventeenth birthday.|$|E

2500|$|In a September 2010 {{interview}} from the prison, Van der Sloot admitted to extorting Twitty, stating: [...] "I {{wanted to get}} back at Natalee's family — her parents have been making my life tough for five years." [...] On September 11, Twitty traveled to Peru with Peter R. De Vries and his Dutch television crew to visit the prison. According to Van der Sloot's attorney Maximo Alonso Altez Navarro, his client was taken [...] "practically by force" [...] to a meeting with Twitty that took [...] "less than one minute." [...] Altez Navarro said that when Twitty asked questions about the disappearance of her daughter, Van der Sloot responded by saying that he could not speak to her without his lawyer present and handing her his lawyer's business card. Altez Navarro claimed that Twitty was [...] "snuck" [...] into the prison without being identified by the Dutch media crew who she was with. A prison spokesperson stated that Twitty's name was not found in the visitor registry. [...] Colonel Abel Gamarra of the Peruvian National Police stated that no arrests had been made. Twitty's attorney John Q. Kelly commented, [...] "I know she didn't tell me ahead of <b>time</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> would have asked her to exercise a little more caution." [...] While in Peru, Twitty spoke with Flores's brother Enrique on camera. On September 17, Holloway and the group left the country for Panama and arrived in Aruba on the same day. Twitty spent a few days in Aruba working with De Vries on a documentary about her missing daughter to be run on Dutch television, reportedly with the cooperation of prosecutors who had been investigating Van der Sloot. The video premiered in November 2010 on SBS6 in the Netherlands and as a special episode of 48 Hours on CBS in the United States, resulting in the suspension of Miguel Castro Castro prison warden Alex Samamé Peña.|$|E

3000|$|The second {{area for}} future {{research}} {{has to do with}} understanding the process of trial and error that makerspaces facilitate. As I described, each of the students involved in this initial makerspace research was involved in an exploration of the media provided to them. This process inevitably involved trial and error, with the end result in each case being something that was far from predictable: “Though this project was very far from my preconceived notion of what I thought I would create with this assignment, I am glad that I had this experience of getting lost a few <b>times,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> feel that it accurately reflected the process of a makerspace.” [...]...|$|R

He was an {{extremely}} polite bloke. I never knew about the drugs then.

This might prove an objection, possibly, to {{those who wish to}} talk; but as I greatly prefer to hear, it would prove none to me. I must say, however, that on this occasion the matter was quite equitably managed. There were, I should think, some twenty or thirty at the breakfast table, and the conversation formed itself into little eddies of two or three around the table, now and then welling out into a great bay of general discourse. I was seated between Macaulay and Milman, and must confess I was a little embarrassed at <b>times,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wanted to hear what they were both saying at the same time. However, by the use of the faculty by which you play a piano with both hands, I got on very comfortably.|$|R
