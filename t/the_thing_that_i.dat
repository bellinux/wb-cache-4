500|$|So {{this song}} is about me {{basically}} saying that just because {{all of those things}} are there [...] doesn't mean that there is not sort of the same person underneath. And then, also that these veils, they are really just protecting me from <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> held the most sacred, which is my creativity ... My Aura is the way that I deal with my insanity and I feel quite insane, so this song sounds very insane ... Everyone thinks that everything I do is a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.|$|E
500|$|Pretty on the Inside {{has had an}} {{influence}} on multiple alternative rock acts, being specifically mentioned by Spinnerette frontwoman Brody Dalle in an interview as a seminal album {{in the development of}} her music. British rock band Nine Black Alps also noted the album as a major influence on their third release, Locked Out from the Inside (2009), and indie singer-songwriter Scout Niblett cited it as a major influence on her: [...] "For me, <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> loved about them and her [...] was the anger, and aggressiveness, along with the tender side", said Niblett. [...] "That was something I hadn't seen before in a woman playing music. That was hugely influential and really inspiring. Women up 'til then were kind of one-dimensional, twee, sweet, ethereal, and that annoys the shit out of me." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{production}} is primarily centered around hi-NRG beats, [...] "stuttering synthesizers", and hard snares. Robbie Daw of Idolator {{noted that the}} [...] "opening, pulsating synths are a straight-up throwback to the 'Poker Face' intro— albeit slightly sped up— while the handclap-laden chorus swells and soars with the same pop frenzy that made 'Paparazzi' such a delight." [...] The Guardians Michael Cragg described the song's composition as [...] "brilliantly camp– all squelchy synths and juddering beats" [...] and likened it to a [...] "ridiculous glam-rock song given a techno makeover". The chorus has been noted to contain [...] "a solid mixture of EDM-influenced pop, glitchy k-pop-lite euphoria and just a twinkle of that original joy of The Fame" [...] and features Gaga singing the lines, [...] "Give me <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> love (I'll turn the lights on) / Put your hands up make 'em touch (Make it real loud)". Her vocal acrobatics during the song's verses have been compared to those of David Bowie, Annie Lennox, and Grace Jones.|$|E

500|$|Streep {{was raised}} as a Presbyterian in Basking Ridge, New Jersey and {{attended}} Cedar Hill Elementary School and the Oak Street School, {{which was a}} Junior High school back then. In her Junior High debut, she starred as Lousie Heller in the play [...] "". In 1963 {{the family moved to}} Bernardsville, New Jersey, where she attended Bernards High School. Author Karina Longworth described her as a [...] "gawky kid with glasses and frizzy hair", yet noted that she liked to show off {{in front of the camera}} in family home movies from a young age. At the age of 12, Streep was selected to sing at a school recital, leading to her having opera lessons from Estelle Liebling. However, despite her talent, she remarked that [...] "I was singing something I didn't feel and understand. That was an important lesson—not to do that. To find <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could feel through". She quit after four years. Streep had many Catholic school friends, and regularly attended mass.|$|E
500|$|In a 2005, {{interview}} with About.com, Burton {{spoke about the}} differences between directing [...] Corpse Bride and The Nightmare Before Christmas, saying: [...] "The difference on that was that one I had designed completely. It was a very completed package in my mind. I felt like it was there. I felt more comfortable with it. With this, it was a bit more organic. It was based on an old folk tale. We kept kind of changing it but, you know, I had a great co-director with Mike Johnson. I feel like we complemented each other quite well. It was just a different movie, a different process." [...] He also spoke about casting Johnny Depp as Victor, saying: [...] "It was weird because we were doing both at the same time. He was Willy Wonka by day and Victor by night so {{it might have been a}} little schizophrenic for him. But he’s great. It's the first animated movie he's done and he's always into a challenge. We just treat it like fun and a creative process. Again, that’s the joy of working with him. He's kind of up for anything. He just always adds something to it. The amazing thing is all the actors never worked [...] They were never in a room together, so they were all doing their voices, except for Albert [...] and Joanna [...] did a few scenes together, everybody else was separate. They were all kind of working in a vacuum, which was interesting. That’s <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt ended up so beautifully, that their performances really meshed together. So he was very canny, as they all were, about trying to find the right tone and making it work while not being in the same room with each other." ...|$|E
2500|$|Director Nisha Ganatra, whose {{previous}} credits {{included the}} multiple-award-winning Chutney Popcorn, was also intrigued by Akhil Sharma's short story. In her words, [...] "I thought, {{this is a}} story we haven't seen. Indian American filmmakers are making these stories that are very 'me, me, me' and <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> loved about Cosmopolitan is that it's about our parents and loneliness, and that I found was very universal and exciting." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Many {{kids got}} killed because the Vietnamese are very good. Most of the Vietnamese {{soldiers}} had experience with Americans, and we didn't know that...And I became {{good friends with}} some of the kids, and in the battlefields sometimes they got shot in {{the left and the right}} from me, in the stomach and the head. Many times I held them, blood all over me. The worst feeling I had was that you can’t help them at all...I saw kids and adults got hit in the head, by the bullets, crawling. So I don't believe in crawling anymore. I just stood up and shoot like hell...I fought about two or three months. <b>The</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> couldn't take is to watch my friends dying every day.
