She was used as a repatriation transport after the war, making nine trips <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>some</b> 40,000 Japanese soldiers and civilians to Japan from overseas locations. Hōshō was scrapped in Japan beginning in 1946.|$|E

5|$|Although Mapenor's time as bishop was short– {{just over}} two years– over 20 of his {{charters}} survive. These include a number for Leominster Priory and Reading Abbey. He also dealt with a dispute over the rights of a Norman abbey, Lyre Abbey, over churches it possessed in the diocese of Hereford, settling it by making the churches part of a prebend in Hereford Cathedral held by the abbot of Lire. Mapenor supported the new king Henry III {{in his efforts to}} suppress the rebellion begun under Henry's father, King John. Mapenor was with the forces of the king before the Battle of Lincoln in May 1217. The bishop was also present when the king and Llywelyn of Gwynedd, a Welsh prince, concluded a peace treaty at Worcester in March 1218. The king employed Mapenor in April as a diplomatic escort, ordering the bishop <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>some</b> of the southern Welsh princes to Woodstock to swear fealty to Henry III. In June of that year, Mapenor attended the consecration of the new Worcester Cathedral. He was the recipient of {{one of a series of}} writs sent to bishops to stop the persecution of Jews. These writs may have resulted from a decision of the king's council to oppose some acts of the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, which placed restrictions on Jews.|$|E

25|$|Hungarian monarchs, {{although}} usually {{observing the}} formalities of canonical election, retained considerable control over church appointments as canons and monks tended to elect royal candidates to higher church offices. Sometimes, however, the monarchs entirely ignored {{the provisions of}} canon law, {{such as in the}} case of Charles I who appointed bishops without canonical election for a period of decades. Popes attempted <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>some</b> important church appointments under their personal control, but a royal statute of 1404 expressly forbade the Vatican from appointing clergy in the kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The Cabinet {{was also}} {{relatively}} elderly, and with younger political {{leaders on the}} scene, like American President John F.

The seven ministers earmarked for replacement averaged 59 years of age. The incoming seven would have an average age of 50. Butler was in favour of the move, and together with Macleod, they worked out an orderly reshuffle of several Cabinet posts, including the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In all, seven ministers were to be replaced, amounting to one third of the total Cabinet of twenty-one.|$|E

25|$|Miјatović's {{wife was}} a member of the Wesleyan Church and was able to imbue her husband with nonconformist {{religious}} devotion. However, he always remained faithful to the Serbian Orthodox Church but wanted <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>some</b> religious zeal into it. That was not a very popular task in Serbia of his time. He found a collaborator in this endeavour in the person of a Belgrade priest Aleksa Ilić who established a religious monthly Hrishchanski Vesnik (Christian Messenger, in Serbian Cyrillic: Хришћански весник), the first journal dedicated to religious revival in Serbia. A Scottish philanthropist Francis Mackenzie who settled in Belgrade helped this project materially and Miјatović remained one of the main contributors of the journal.|$|E
25|$|To avoid {{overproduction}} and {{to prop up}} farmgate {{prices for}} agricultural commodities, the EU has {{for a long time}} have had farm subsidy programs to encourage farmers not to produce and leave productive acres fallow. The 2008 crisis prompted proposals <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>some</b> of the reserve farmland back into use, and the used area increased actually with 0.5% but today these areas are once again out of use. According to Eurostat, 18 million hectares has been abandoned since 1990, 7,4 millions hectares are currently set aside, and the EU has recently decided to set aside another 5–7% in so called Ecological Focus Areas, corresponding to 10–12 million hectares. In spite of this reduction of used land, the EU is a net exporter of e.g. wheat.|$|E

25|$|On September 25, 2007, the United States Supreme Court {{agreed to}} hear a lethal-injection {{challenge}} arising from Kentucky, Baze v. Rees.

Although uncertainty over whether executions in the United States would be put on hold during {{the period in which}} the United States Supreme Court considers the constitutionality of lethal injection initially arose after the court agreed to hear Baze, no executions took place during the period between when the court agreed to hear the case and when its ruling was announced, {{with the exception of one}} lethal injection in Texas hours after the court made its announcement.|$|E
25|$|Many of the {{producers}} behind the Super Tuscan movement were originally Chianti producers who were rebelling against what they felt were antiquated DOC regulations. Some of these producers wanted to make Chiantis that were 100% varietal Sangiovese. Others wanted the flexibility to experiment with blending French grape varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot or to {{not be required to}} blend in any white grape varieties. The late 20th century saw a flurry of creativity and innovation in the Chianti zones as producers experimented with new grape varieties and introduced modern wine-making techniques {{such as the use of}} new oak barrels. The prices and wine ratings of some Super Tuscans would regularly eclipse those of DOC sanctioned Chiantis. The success of the Super Tuscans encouraged government officials to reconsider the DOC regulations in order <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>some</b> of these wines back into the fold labelled as Chianti.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Ashoka ascended the throne, the Mauryan {{imperial}} system had become complex, encompassing various cultures, beliefs {{and social and}} political patterns. Ashoka had to either maintain the structure by forcewhich would incur tremendous expensesor to define a set of social norms which would be acceptable to all social practices and religious beliefs. He {{was aware of the}} tensions which the heterodox sectsBuddhism, Jainism and Ajiviksimhad generated in society. They were all opposed to the domination of the Brahmans and had a growing number of supporters. But Brahmans continued to control society and hostility was inevitable. It was essential to bring about a climate of harmony and mutual trust. There were many areas within the empire where neither the Brahmanical system or the heterodox sects prevailed. Ashoka referred to the country of Yavanas, where neither Brahmanical nor Sramanical culture were in vogue. In many tribal areas, people were unfamiliar with Brahmanical or heterodox ideas. To make the empire survive and <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>some</b> cohesion within the empire {{in the midst of this}} diversity, some common patterns of behaviour and common approaches to the society's problems were needed.|$|E
