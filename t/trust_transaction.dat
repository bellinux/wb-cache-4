50|$|Prior to European colonisation, Tieke was {{a trading}} centre on the Whanganui River {{as well as}} a place of {{learning}} and a fortified pā. In 1841 Tieke was described by Wakefield as a large settlement (perhaps 80-90 inhabitants); in the 1840s it shifted across the river and changed its name to Te Ririatepo, but by 1851 it had shifted back and was known as Okirihau, with a population of 93. The area was part of the government's 1886 Waimarino Purchase intended to allow sale of land to settlers, and the chief Te Rangihuatau who lived at Tieke assisted with the purchase. However, there was confusion over whether Tieke itself was included. Te Rangihuatau considered it to be Māori land, the government considered it “Crown Lands which the Natives are allowed to use and occupy without a title”.

5000|$|The Code makes a {{distinction}} between certain classes of beneficiaries {{with respect to the}} traditional reporting requirements for trustees with respect to the assets and transactions actually held in the trust. Under the older common law, only current beneficiaries (sometimes termed [...] "income beneficiaries") were entitled to receive reports or accountings of <b>trust</b> <b>transactions</b> and that such reports were sufficient to protect the interest of those current beneficiaries. [...] However, the Code has now permitted [...] "qualified beneficiaries" [...] to at least be informed of their right to receive a trustee's periodic report of <b>trust</b> <b>transactions</b> and assets and are entitled to receive it if they do in fact request it. [...] "Qualified beneficiaries" [...] are defined as a beneficiary who, on the date the beneficiary's qualification is determined: (A) is a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal; (B) would become a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if a present distributees' interest ended on that date without causing the trust to terminate; or (C) would become a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the trust did terminate on that date. [...] Essentially, this means that future beneficiaries (i.e., children or grandchildren) might be exposed to information that the grantor only intended to pass to the current beneficiaries. Although the UTC limited the reporting requirements to trustees accepting duties after the Code's enactment, a number of states have changed the standard UTC language, often in response to concerns from corporate trustees of the unwieldiness of such requirements and the danger that future trust beneficiaries may interfere and create contention concerning the operation of the trust.|$|R
40|$|Food {{markets in}} {{affluent}} countries {{tend to be}} characterized by increasing complexity under several regards such as {{the organization of the}} productive chains, the process that leads to the formation of consumer’s preferences, the information/communication task and the building of trust among stakeholders. In particular, consumers are increasingly concerned about many credence attributes such as food safety, environmental concerns, the fairness of trade conditions, product origin and so forth. The paper focus on short chains and consumers’ buying groups (CBGs) seen as strategies to overcome the emerging difficulties that consumers face in collecting and processing information on credence attributes. The results of a field survey, based on e-mail interviews to Italian CBGs’ members are presented. The survey had the aim to explore personal motivations to join a CBG, the groups’ main objectives and organization and, eventually, the degree of satisfaction with this organization of the food shopping. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyses the sources of consumer’s substantial distrust on many of the products available on food markets and underlines that the most common remedies to market failures due to asymmetric information, undertaken both by producers and policy makers, are far to be fully effective. Section 3 is devoted to short chains, directly connecting producers to consumers, and CBGs, i. e. families that organize their shopping on a collective basis to better pursue their ethical goals and to gain organizational advantages. Both weakness and strength points of short chains and of CBGs are briefly discussed from the consumers’ {{as well as from the}} producers’ point of view.

40|$|Scarcity of {{information}} on office transaction opportunities contributes to office markets being illiquid. Asset and vendor identity is problematic since information is privately held and highly localised in geographically dispersed markets. DiMaggio and Louch (1998) and Rangan, (2000) demonstrate how social networks resolve market uncertainty where conversional mechanisms which rely on publicly available information are not practical. The research question is how social networks are used to resolve uncertainty in commercial office sales markets. Methodology: The paper adopted an exploratory research approach. Data was collected through in-depth face-to-face interviews with opportunistically sampled commercial real estate brokers in Johannesburg, South Africa. Data was organised using NVivo (1999) ® and employed constructivist theoretical thematic analysis. Findings: Social networks seem relevant in high-value office sales transactions involving sophisticated clients. Brokers use social networks to access private information on clients’ acquisition and disposal criteria, manage information on transaction activity as per clients’ interests, pool potential buyers, channel business opportunities, and build relations and <b>trust.</b> <b>Transaction</b> {{are likely to be}} publicly marketed when they involve unsophisticated clients or unknown buyers. Research limitations: There is descriptive validity threat relating to factual validity of respondents’ accounts. There are also interpretive validity threats on accuracy of respondents’ interpretation of contexts, and researcher’s interpretation of responses. Introducing non-mainstream real estate concepts and using an opportunistic sample presents a theoretical validity threat of a plausible theoretical framework associating social networks to office sales transactions. Research implications: This paper contributes to understanding how social networks address information asymmetry in sales transactions where conventional mechanisms are not able to cost-effectively do so. Originality: This paper is extracted from the first author’s PhD research on liquidity in commercial real estate markets. Social networks have been explored in business and built environment, but there are no previous studies that have sought to understand social networks in office sales markets...|$|E
40|$|Keywords: Social capital, guanxi networks, {{vegetable}} supply chains, buyer-seller relationships, channel performance, China Guanxi is {{ubiquitous in}} China and significantly influences people's behaviour in social {{life and in}} business. Guanxi refers to personal relationships or connections and is widely recognised as a Chinese form of social capital. This book focuses on the questions, if, and if so, how small-scale producers, together with processors and exporters, can be more successfully integrated into high-value supply chains (i. e., processors, supermarkets and international markets). In particular, our focus is on how Chinese vegetable farmers can use their guanxi networks to be integrated into these modern supply chains and can improve their market performance. We study the effectiveness of both formal (contracts) and relational (guanxi) governance mechanisms to improve the integration of buyer-seller relationships and ultimately, to enhance chain performance. We apply various theoretical approaches, supply chain management, social capital theory and transaction cost economics, to develop propositions regarding the interrelation of support from guanxi networks (what guanxi can do for you), buyer-seller relationships (interpersonal <b>trust,</b> <b>transaction</b> specific investments and contractual governance) and market performance (compliance with delivery/quality requirements, efficiency, quality/price satisfaction, and profitability). We combine case study with survey analysis and use structural equation modelling techniques to test the propositions. Background analysis of the Chinese vegetable sector indicates that small-scale farmers usually fail to integrate into high-value market outlets. This is because these farmers face several constraints, such as small production scale, less possibilities to implement quality standards, low negotiation power, and information asymmetry. However, empirical analysis based on three different buyer-seller relationships, including farmers, processors and exporters/supermarkets, shows that support from guanxi networks and integration of buyer-seller relationships significantly contribute to market performance (especially with downstream partners). The effects of guanxi networks differ between primary producers, processors and exporters/supermarkets, and across marketing channels. Vegetable farmers and their buyers show an idiosyncratic way to rely on their guanxi networks in doing business. Furthermore, vegetable farmers and their buyers follow different approaches to achieve market performance. Interpersonal trust and compliance with delivery requirements are important factors for all parties in supply chains to achieve superior performance. Particularly, in relationships with downstream partners, the sellers tend to rely on their guanxi networks when conducting transactions. In relationships with upstream partners, guanxi networks and contractual governance are less often used. This study shows {{that the combination of}} formal (contract) and informal (guanxi) governance mechanisms seems to {{be the best way to}} improve chain performance in vegetable supply chains in China. Policy should be directed to improve farmers' capacity to participate in modern high-value markets as well as to enhance the prospects for China 's vegetables in the world...|$|E

40|$|How {{to develop}} a trust {{management}} model and then to efficiently control and manage nodes {{is an important issue}} in the scope of social network security. In this paper, a trust management model based on a cloud model is proposed. The cloud model uses a specific computation operator to achieve the transformation from qualitative concepts to quantitative computation. Additionally, this {{can also be used to}} effectively express the fuzziness, randomness and the relationship between them of the subjective trust. The node trust is divided into reputation <b>trust</b> and <b>transaction</b> <b>trust.</b> In addition, evaluation methods are designed, respectively. Firstly, the two-dimension trust cloud evaluation model is designed based on node’s comprehensive and trading experience to determine the reputation trust. The expected value reflects the average trust status of nodes. Then, entropy and hyper-entropy are used to describe the uncertainty of trust. Secondly, the calculation methods of the proposed direct <b>transaction</b> <b>trust</b> and the recommendation <b>transaction</b> <b>trust</b> involve comprehensively computation of the <b>transaction</b> <b>trust</b> of each node. Then, the choosing strategies were designed for node to trade based on trust cloud. Finally, the results of a simulation experiment in P 2 P network file sharing on an experimental platform directly reflect the objectivity, accuracy and robustness of the proposed model, and could also effectively identify the malicious or unreliable service nodes in the system. In addition, this can be used to promote the service reliability of the nodes with high credibility, by which the stability of the whole network is improved...|$|R

40|$|Clusters are {{characterized}} as geographical concentrations of firms {{in a similar}} industry with the benefits of sharing resources and creating better opportunities for innovation. This study examines the effect of geographical cluster’s characteristics – cluster size and cluster knowledge, on the earnings management behavior of firms. Cluster size refers to the industry density of firms in a region, while cluster knowledge is a proxy for innovation activities within the same geographic area. This thesis offers two competing arguments to explain the relationship between clusters characteristics and earnings management from competence and governance perspectives. The competence perspective suggests that the geographic concentration of firms in a similar industry encourages co-operation and competition among cluster actors. Repeated interaction among proximate partners and inter-firms collaborations can facilitate knowledge transfer and strengthen mutual trust among cluster firms. Strong social capital coupled with trust can mitigate opportunistic behavior such as earnings management. The high number of firms in a cluster is likely to reduce earnings management behavior via trust building processes. However, based on the governance perspective of cluster theory, collaborations among competing firms do not necessarily generate <b>trust.</b> <b>Transaction</b> costs economists argue that co-operation in a joint project potentially increases the probability of hold-up problems, as some important transaction terms (such as delivery time and quality of output) cannot be predefined in formal contracts, and thus increase the hazards associated with opportunistic behavior. Moreover, this also potentially {{increases the risk of}} unintended knowledge spillover, where a partner firm, which is also a close competitor may use the knowledge gleaned in the collaboration as a “weapon” to compete. In addition, more firms competing for the same and limited resources in a large cluster will lead to competitive uncertainty that can induce firms to engage in opportunistic earnings management. In so far as opportunistic earnings management is concerned, the competence and the governance perspectives of cluster theory generate competing predictions between clusters and earnings management. According to the competence perspective, clusters are drivers of innovations which is considered critical to generating competitive advantage for a region. In a competitive and uncertain business environment, the competitive advantage that firms generate from innovation is the key to sustaining long term survival in an industry. As innovation is a key factor in limiting competitive uncertainty it is regarded as a leading factor in mitigating opportunistic earnings management. Firms located in a knowledge cluster are expected to manage earnings less. On the other hand, based on the governance perspective, the realization of the potential benefits of investment in innovative activities is uncertain until the innovation projects are certified as “successful”. Therefore, the potential return on investment in innovative projects comes with a higher risk of uncertainty. As high uncertainty is attached to knowledge clusters, it is logical to predict that firms located in a knowledge cluster may manage earnings more. Based on the above arguments, the two cluster characteristics - cluster size and cluster knowledge may induce or mitigate earnings management behavior. Assuming the presence of potential asymmetry in benefits and hazards from geographic clustering, each firm competes with its rivals using its business strategy (or competitive strategy) that could, in turn, affect the link between clusters and earnings management. Applying the topology of Miles and Snow (1978, 2003) into this research context, the two extreme business strategies of “prospectors” and “defenders” affect the relationship between clusters and earnings management. Prospector firms are customer-orientated and heavily involved in the innovative activities that can differentiate them from their rivals. Defender firms are competitor-orientated, less innovative and try to beat financial performance of their competitors. When a cluster becomes larger, less innovative defender firms will face highly competitive uncertainty and tend to manage earnings more to beat the financial performance of their proximate competitors. However, defender firms are expected to enjoy more benefits than costs within innovative clusters (cluster knowledge) as they enjoy the benefits from knowledge inflows from their proximate innovative firms (such as prospector firms). They can translate the knowledge gained into better performance. The primary data used in this research consist of unbalanced panel data of U. S. firms, covering the period of 2000 to 2011. Regression models for testing the hypotheses are estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS) proposed by Petersen (2009). Even though the issue of endogeneity or reverse causality is not a major concern in this study, a change model and instrument variables method are used to address the problems. This study supports the argument based on the governance perspective, and shows that both cluster characteristics (cluster size and cluster knowledge), are associated with higher earnings management. Consistent with the predictions, defender firms manage earnings more when they locate themselves in a larger (highly dense) cluster; and manage earnings less when they locate themselves in a knowledge cluster. Cluster theory is a new topic in accounting literature even though it has been examined extensively in the strategic management and geographic economics literature. This research contributes to the accounting literature by linking the cluster theory and business strategy to the earnings management literature. It is relatively new to the accounting literature. Clusters are considered competitive business environments as competing firms in similar and related industries are concentrated in the same geographic regions. Therefore, clusters matter to entrepreneurs who wish to make location decisions by considering whether they can fully leverage the benefits from the cluster environment. Since the level of competition in a cluster is an important factor affecting a firm’s business risk, the research findings of this thesis are useful for various social actors in a cluster environment. The ability of firms to manage risks via an efficient internal control system is the main concern of auditors and regulatory bodies such as the SEC (U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission). The SEC should pay attention to clustered firms regarding internal control issues, as U. S. firms are committed to complying with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) by ensuring the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting. In order to mitigate opportunistic earnings management, auditor rotation policies should be implemented to improve audit quality. Auditors may charge higher audit fees if their assessment of a client’s business risk is high and there are additional regulatory requirements for auditing a clustered firm. This study also has implications for practice since policy makers should consider clusters in designing policies that could discourage earnings management. Cluster policy makers also can further enhance their knowledge of the importance of considering the types of business strategies in any cluster policy or program. Prospector firms, as compared to defender firms, are less likely to manage earnings in a cluster, as they are capable of sustaining their business by creating innovation. This indicates that the participation of prospector firms in a cluster program is important in stimulating the cluster’s growth...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that trust is a mechanism of relational governance, which can influence the costs associated with the formation, development and maintenance of interorganizational relationships, in this article one aims to test the relation between <b>trust</b> and <b>transaction</b> costs in these relationships. Based on the literature on <b>trust</b> and on <b>transaction</b> costs, one puts forward four new hypotheses, which suggest a negative relation between trust and costs of information, of negotiation, of implementation and of monitoring in interorganizational relationships. These hypotheses were tested using multiple regression analysis in a quantitative case study where the buyer is illustrated by an automaker and its suppliers are represented by a sample of the major ones. The results suggest that there are significant, yet negative relations between trust and costs of negotiation and of monitoring. The relations between trust and costs of information and of implementation, in turn, are not statistically significant.
