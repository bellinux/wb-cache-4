5|$|In the 19th {{century the}} fight for Warsaw {{became one of the}} icons of Polish culture, {{described}} by, among others, Polish romantic poets Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Słowacki.

The fall of Warsaw also garnered sympathy for the Poles and <b>their</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> independence.|$|E
5|$|By 1851, {{however, the}} {{reduction}} {{system of the}} missions had disappeared.

5|$|Rivalries were renewed in 1999–2000 {{following}} Manchester City's promotion back to {{the second}} tier. Stockport County beat Manchester City at Maine Road {{for the first time}} in history (1999–2000) thanks to goals from former City youngster Alan Bailey and County legend Tony Dinning. Manchester City were famously defeated once more by Stockport County in 2001–02, when 2 late goals from John Hardiker handed bottom of the table Stockport victory, and in the process City were prevented from gaining 100 points in <b>their</b> <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> the Division One title. Stockport County and Manchester City met six times between 1997 and 2002, with Stockport County winning three times, losing once and drawing twice. The defeats suffered at the hands of County clearly touched a raw nerve with many Manchester City supporters, some of whom have celebrated County's downfall on the 'bluemoon' forum. The rivalry with City is made all the more complex by the fact that Stockport is a hotbed for Manchester City support.|$|E

40|$|Situated at the {{intersection}} of leisure and tourism, there is currently a renewed interest and curiosity in ancestral lineages. Focusing on amateur genealogists who pursue, and travel for, a leisure engagement of genealogy, this qualitative research study endeavours to investigate <b>their</b> <b>quests</b> <b>for</b> personal identity and locations of an intergenerational sense of self. With the adoption of a narrative inquiry method, life story interviews were conducted with four amateur genealogists. Findings from an analysis of the narratives have been organized into five core themes, each of which contributes to our understanding of these amateur genealogists’ experiences of leisure and travel. While the amateur genealogists do not acknowledge their leisure engagements as a <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> personal identity, they make use of such engagements to locate an intergenerational sense of self and gain enriched self-understandings. Moreover, by facilitating intersections of genealogy, leisure, and tourism, several key insights are offered that may be of particular interest to scholars in both fields of study...|$|R
