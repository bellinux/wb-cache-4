5|$|Although the {{scientific}} discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides {{in understanding the}} nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions.

5|$|During the 20th {{century and}} {{following}} the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method, astrology has been challenged successfully on both <b>theoretical</b> <b>and</b> experimental grounds, and {{has been shown to}} have no scientific validity or explanatory power. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it has largely declined. While polling studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say they continue to believe that star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.|$|E

5|$|Partly {{because of}} <b>theoretical</b> <b>and</b> {{mathematical}} difficulties {{and partly because}} of the extremely high energies (beyond what is technologically possible for the foreseeable future) needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any of these models being a correct fundamental description of nature.

He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's <b>theoretical</b> <b>and</b> scientific knowledge, he handled this task efficiently.
