5|$|A {{transmission}} line {{is required to}} bring the generated power to (often remote) markets. For an off-shore station this may require a submarine cable. Construction of a new high-voltage line may be <b>too</b> <b>costly</b> for the wind resource alone, but wind sites may take advantage of lines installed for conventionally fueled generation.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to what was}} built, the original plans also called for a multi-story parking garage, a 550-seat conventional movie theatre, and a direct underground link to the Museum subway stop. These features were deemed <b>too</b> <b>costly</b> and were never built.|$|E
5|$|Many {{observers}} took {{a moderate}} tone in their reaction, acknowledging that funding {{should be provided}} for further national missile defense tests, but also saying that the US should not rush into developing technology that might prove ineffective and <b>too</b> <b>costly.</b>|$|E
40|$|Asthma {{affects the}} airways {{to and fro}} from human lungs, due to {{blockage}} of air breathing problem also occurs. People suffering from this type of problems {{are said to be}} asthmatic. In this paper a feature extraction technique is applied for extracting similar features in asthmatic patients and normal human being. Mel – frequency Cepstral Coefficient technique is used for feature extraction process. As there is no proper cure for this disease and treatment is <b>too</b> <b>costlier,</b> here is a start up of diagnosing this disease in initiation stages using this technique...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{applies the}} {{financial}} intermediation and optimal contract theories {{to the standard}} Hotelling model. In it, we demonstrate that too little investment is undertaken and <b>too</b> much <b>costly</b> monitoring {{is involved in the}} unregulated banking industry. Thus, our model suggests a rationale for the government to regulate bank locations. © 1993. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|In April 1885, the Cosmos Club {{considered}} {{purchasing the}} house from the Tayloe family. The influential club already owned most of the block north of the Tayloe House, and was expanding rapidly. It valued the home at $60,000 and the furnishings at an additional $5,000. The Cosmos Club declined to buy the home after an investigation found {{that the cost of}} upgrading the Tayloe property for its use would be <b>too</b> <b>costly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most Polish historians {{agree that}} the Polish {{capitulation}} was a mistake both from the military perspective, and the political one. In the realm of military, the Poles had reasonable chances to defend the Vistula river line, and exhaust the Russian invading forces. From the political one, showing willingness to fight could have persuaded the partitioning powers that their plan was <b>too</b> <b>costly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Written by Philip Hinchcliffe, {{this story}} {{involved}} the Doctor and Romana encountering an alien Luron called Godrin who crash {{landed in a}} South American jungle in 1870. Adams wrote to Hinchcliffe on 3 January 1979, explaining that the proposed script would be <b>too</b> <b>costly</b> to produce. It was later adapted as The Valley of Death by Jonathan Morris for Big Finish's The Lost Stories series in January 2012.|$|E
50|$|Penalty fares are not fines, and {{are used}} when no legal basis for prosecuting fare evasion exists, {{prosecution}} is deemed <b>too</b> drastic and <b>costly,</b> or is unlikely to result in conviction.|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Stefano rewrote 'Natural Selection' {{as there}} were <b>too</b> many <b>costly</b> aliens and visual effects called for, and that the testing {{procedures}} endured by Mike were too complicated, redundant or riddled with technical gibberish. He also felt Em's revelation as an ape was too similar {{to the end of}} another episode, [...] "The Sixth Finger", and that The Outer Limits did not need another Earth take-over story.|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} shot in Old San Juan and Miami and Coral Gables, Florida, as the crew decided {{shooting}} on location in Santo Domingo would be <b>too</b> dangerous and <b>costly</b> after scouting there.|$|R
5|$|A lack of {{knowledge}} about the capability of radar to create an effective centralized early warning system also contributed to the over-reliance on the self-defense capabilities of bombers. However Hansell also argued that ignorance of radar was fortuitous in the long run. He surmised that had radar been a factor in making doctrine, many theorists would have reasoned that massed defenses would make all strategic air attacks <b>too</b> <b>costly,</b> inhibiting if not entirely suppressing the concepts that proved decisive in World War II and essential {{to the creation of the}} United States Air Force.|$|E
5|$|After the disbandment of No. 50 Squadron, two Vulcans {{continued}} {{flying with}} the RAF in air displays {{as part of}} the Vulcan Display Flight, based at Waddington but administered through No. 55 Squadron, based at RAF Marham. Initially displaying using XL426, in 1986 that aircraft was sold, having been replaced by XH558, which began displays in 1985. The VDF continued with XH558 until 1992, finishing operations after the Ministry of Defence determined it was <b>too</b> <b>costly</b> to run in light of budget cuts. Both aircraft subsequently entered preservation and survived, although a third, XH560, kept in reserve in the first years, was later scrapped.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the USACE {{was working}} to obtain funding, {{which was the}} major {{obstacle}} for completion; public concerns about the project were {{that it was not}} needed and would be <b>too</b> <b>costly.</b> The USACE announced in 1981 that an environmental impact report was necessary before the project could begin, following the Endangered Species Act of 1973; the least tern and light-footed clapper rail were considered endangered, and construction would have affected their habitat. The next year, the environmental impact report process began, funded by the USACE.|$|E

50|$|A {{separate}} greenfield {{factory to}} be built in San Jose, California was also announced. However, the cost was prohibitive, and the company looked for alternatives. Tesla initially also dismissed NUMMI for being <b>too</b> big and <b>costly.</b>|$|R
50|$|Taylor J {{held that}} the trust was invalid, because it was {{administratively}} unworkable to distribute such small amounts to all people. The trust was not, however, ‘capricious’, but merely <b>too</b> difficult and <b>costly</b> for a court to enforce.|$|R
5|$|Ownership of {{the timber}} land {{around the tree}} was {{eventually}} acquired by the Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust, which leased the timbering rights to the North East Lumber Company. Under the lease agreement, the North East Lumber Company only paid for the lumber that it cleared from the land. The company found the Mingo Oak too large to cut down, and assessed that its removal was <b>too</b> <b>costly</b> to undertake. The Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust also leased out the land where the tree was located to the Island Creek Coal Company for mining.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, in 1791, {{with his}} ideas for {{manufacturing}} being a major influence, Hamilton, along with Coxe and several entrepreneurs from New York and Philadelphia helped form the Society for the Establishment of Useful Manufactures, a private industrial corporation. In May 1792, the directors decided to scope out The Passaic Falls. On July 4, 1792, The society directors met Philip Schuyler at Abraham Godwin's {{hotel on the}} Passaic River, where they would lead a tour prospecting the area for the national manufactory. It was originally suggested that they dig mile long trenches and build the factories away from the falls, but Hamilton argued {{that it would be}} <b>too</b> <b>costly</b> and laborious.|$|E
5|$|The German {{were forced}} to {{withdraw}} from the north of the Orne but Allied forces were unable to push beyond the Orne. German forces were dug-in on the opposite bank in position to block a move south. Montgomery called off an advance beyond the Orne as further attacks would be <b>too</b> <b>costly</b> for the gains made, which had inflicted much attrition on the defenders. For French public opinion the operation was a coup; civilians now believed the liberation of France was truly under way.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, much {{important}} legacy COBOL software uses unstructured code, {{which has}} become unmaintainable. It can be <b>too</b> risky and <b>costly</b> to modify even a simple section of code, since it may be used from unknown places in unknown ways.|$|R
2500|$|Lions Clubs International Foundation is [...] "Lions helping Lions {{serve the}} world". Donations provide funding {{in the form}} of grants to financially assist Lions districts with {{large-scale}} humanitarian projects that are <b>too</b> expansive and <b>costly</b> for Lions to finance on their own.|$|R
50|$|Ideally {{benchmarks}} {{should only}} substitute for real applications if the application is unavailable, or <b>too</b> difficult or <b>costly</b> to port {{to a specific}} processor or computer system. If performance is critical, the only benchmark that matters is the target environment's application suite.|$|R
5|$|The PV {{industry}} has seen drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking {{the achievement of}} grid parity for PV. These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains <b>too</b> <b>costly</b> on an unsubsidized basis to compete with conventional generation options. Yet technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.|$|E
5|$|The nave was in poorest {{condition}} and the walls were substantially rebuilt and the porch wholly replaced {{in the first phase}} in 1868-9, with Thomas Williams of Cardiff the contractor. The font was restored at this time. Traces of painted decoration were found in the nave, including a colossal St Christopher on the north wall opposite the entrance. Unfortunately this and other traces of fresco could not be saved; they were destroyed without a pictorial record of them having been made. The committee considered an oak roof for the nave, but rejected it as <b>too</b> <b>costly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Certain {{personal}} {{effects of the}} characters that were familiar to the public {{were added to the}} sets. The prologue and climactic scene in the Granita restaurant was shot on location in the restaurant itself. Frears subdued Berrington's performance to avoid portraying Cherie as too much of a Lady Macbeth figure; in the scene where Cherie encourages Blair to stand for the leadership, Frears had Berrington stand with her back towards the camera. Editing and post-production went on until September. Some historical events—such as the Sheffield Rally and footage of the 1997 general election—were <b>too</b> <b>costly</b> to refilm so archive footage was used instead. Adam Curtis assisted in the editing of the archive footage.|$|E
50|$|Armstrong, {{the main}} British {{artillery}} producer, began {{a project for}} creation of an even larger weapon, an 18 in gun, also called the '100 ton'. Armstrong offered it to the Royal Navy, which rejected the gun, deeming it <b>too</b> heavy and <b>costly.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Justice Stephen Breyer also filed a {{dissenting opinion}} arguing that Indiana's law was unconstitutional. [...] While he spoke approvingly of some voter ID laws, {{he found that}} Indiana's {{procedures}} for acquiring an ID were <b>too</b> burdensome and <b>costly</b> for some low income or elderly voters.|$|R
40|$|In {{wireless}} network planning, much e#ort {{is spent on}} {{the improvement of the}} network and transport layer [...] especially for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks. Although in principle realworld measurements are necessary for this, their setup is often <b>too</b> complex and <b>costly.</b> Hence good and reliable simulation tools are needed...|$|R
5|$|Italia and Lepanto {{spent the}} first decade of their careers {{alternative}} between the Active and Reserve Squadrons of the Italian fleet, and were primarily occupied with training exercises. As Italy {{was a member of the}} Triple Alliance at the time, the simulated opponent in these maneuvers was typically France; during the 1893 annual fleet maneuvers, both ships served in the squadron simulating an attack on the Italian coast. In June 1897, Lepanto steamed to Britain to represent Italy at the Fleet Review for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, held on the 26th of the month. The ships continued to alternate between the squadrons, with 1897 and 1898 in the Reserve, and 1899 in the Active Squadron. During this period, the Italian Navy considered rebuilding the ships along the same lines as the ironclad , but the project proved to be <b>too</b> <b>costly,</b> and by 1902 the plan was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{himself was}} asked by the College to design a new {{building}} near fashionable Trafalgar Square but Nash's elaborate plan proved <b>too</b> <b>costly</b> and ambitious for the College. At the same time the College also asked Robert Abraham to submit to them a second plan for the building. When Nash heard that another architect was approached behind his back he reacted vehemently, and attacked the heralds. The College nevertheless continued with their plans. However they were constantly beset by conflicts between the different officers over the amount needed to build a new building. By 1827 the college still had no coherent plan; the Duke of Norfolk ordered the College to drop the matter altogether. By 1842 the heralds were reconciled with their location and once again commissioned Abraham to build a new octagonal-shaped Record Room {{on the site of the}} old Sugar House.|$|E
5|$|The {{railways}} {{would not}} build across the western frontier without settlement {{as it would}} be <b>too</b> <b>costly</b> to provide train service across a barren wilderness. The Clifford Sifton immigration policy encourages settlers to arrive. Western settlement began and immigration encroached across the Manitoba boundary into the North-West Territories, later to become Saskatchewan. Immigration settlement to the last best west and the highway early beginnings began in the southeast. The federal government survey crew reached this southeastern area of the District of Assiniboia, North-West Territories in 1880. In 1881, the province of Manitoba expanded to its present boundaries and land could be purchased for $10 an acre. U.S. President Lincoln's Homestead Act was passed in 1862 and lands there were taken. In 1872, Canada passed the Dominion Lands Act, attracting homesteaders to the West.|$|E

50|$|GreatFire {{has worked}} with BBC to make the Chinese-language BBC website {{available}} to users in China, despite it being blocked by the Great Firewall, by using a method known as collateral freedom that mirrored content on widely used content delivery networks, such as Amazon CloudFront and CloudFlare, {{so that it would}} be <b>too</b> economically <b>costly</b> for censors to block. The organization has since set up similar mirror sites for other blocked websites, such as Google and the New York Times, with a directory of links hosted on GitHub, which is currently not accessible in China.|$|R
