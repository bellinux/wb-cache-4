To identify limits and benefits of this approach, results of application on SPOT 5 imagery concerning the Gulf of Naples are presented and discussed.

It was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee for Peter M.

40|$|Background: An {{increase}} in NTM diseases {{in the international}} scenario has been observed in recent years. Aims: To analyze the epidemiological and laboratory profiles of patients with isolation of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) over one decade. A retrospective analysis of records of a mycobacterial reference laboratory found 135 cases with isolation of NTM. Methods: Clinical and epidemiological {{data were collected from}} the records of government health clinics and from the State notification system (TBWEB). The cases were geocoded by location based on the street address in the <b>Mercator</b> <b>Transverse</b> Universal projection, Datum SAD/ 69 and MapInfo software. Results: Most patients were male (66. 7 %), older than 50 years (40 %) and had only completed elementary schooling (38. 5 %). Associated health problems were found in 71. 8 % of the subjects, with 43. 7 % being HIV positive and 25. 9 % having had tuberculosis in the past. Hospitals were the most able institutions to diagnose cases (45. 2 %). Sputum was the most common material tested (63. 0 %) with the bacilloscopy being positive in 33. 3 % of cases. The most common mycobacteria species in the region were Mycobacterium avium and M. abscessus/M. massiliense/M. bolletii. When the regional reference municipality was analyzed, M. avium and M. fortuitum were the most common species isolated in the urban area. Conclusions: In the study region, mycobacteriosis most affected adult males with low schooling. Most patients presented comorbidities in particular co-infection with the HIV virus. M. avium is the most prevalent species in the region with the M. abscessus/M. massiliense/M. bolletii species being the main cause of nosocomial infections...|$|R
40|$|The city of Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas, has {{historically}} presented processes landslides {{in the southern}} part of the valley, specifically in deposits of slope whose genesis is determined from La Mesa karst of Copoya, geological forms subjected to intense fracturing processes dissolution and erosion, giving as a result the breaking into large blocks. These are distributed in the margins of La Mesa being altered and destroyed by mechanical and chemical weathering, which generated smaller particles that rest on siltstones, shale and sandstones. This condition determines that the slopes are unstable by nature. A 1000 x 1000 m grid was constructed, corresponding to the canvass of the <b>Mercator</b> <b>Transverse</b> Universal Coordinate System (UTM) of the topographic map scale 1 : 50 000 (INEGI, 1984; INEGI, 2004; Lugo-Hubp, 1988). In each cell a centroid was generated to apply the interpolation process and draw isolines. For numerical variables such as drainage density and unevenness, defined ranges (number of equal intervals) were used by ArcMap software (version 9. 3). For the non-quantitative variables such as geology, edaphology and soil use and vegetation, the same AHP method was used, obtaining numerical values for the cartographic representation. In all three cases, the normalized values and a Consistency Index (CI) and Consistency Ratio (CR) (the latter according to the dimension of the matrix) were obtained, below 10 %, so that the weights are correct. In order to obtain information on the changes in the use of the ground, images of Google Earth of 2006, 2008 and 2010 were revised. Subsequently, a very high resolution orthophoto was added (pixel of 0. 2 m), obtained for cadastral purposes by Town Hall of Tuxtla Gutierrez between the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013. Finally, five layers of information are defined, one for each variable, and the final result overlaps with the events recorded in the last nine years (2006 to date), which shows that the areas classified as Very High Threat are the more susceptible to the occurrence of these events. It is to be expected that in time, the incidence of this type of phenomena is manifested in the levels of High and Very High Threat. Applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) developed by Saaty (1988), which consists of matrix analysis and involves value judgments. In this way the matrix of preference over the selected criteria was generated, obtaining the weighting of the five chosen variables. It was important the knowledge of the study area, the documentation and local studies generated to date, where the criteria of the specialists are taken up. The process was done in an Excel spreadsheet (2007 version), applying the corresponding formulas. Because only five variables and the size of the area (250 km 2) were handled, no specialized software was required. With the data obtained a table was created in which a column with the name of "Threat" was created, which corresponds to the sum of the parameters of the six criteria mentioned above. This is reflected in the Map of Threats by Mass Removal Processes. Thus, in the one the extreme values are included in a range from 0 to 1. The map of hazard by removing processes in mass or landslide (PRM), was developed from the heuristic combination of multi-criteria analysis method, and determined five levels of threat in the urban area, covering the following percentages: Very Low 5 %, Low 27. 1 %, Middle 39. 3 %, High 15. 3 % and Very High 13. 3 %, the latter being distributed mostly in slope deposits around La Mesa of Copoya, confirming their status as maximum hazard. For Tuxtla Gutierrez is estimated a population exposed about 62, 500 inhabitants (11. 6 % of the total) (537. 102 inhabitants in the urban area) who reside both {{in the southern part}} of the city and 30 rural towns settled on the flanks of La Mesa of Copoya; estimates about 28, 000 dwellings exposed grouped into 850 blocks. Current trends in the growth of the city, make evident the need to manage and regulate new buildings. Although the southern slope is determined unstable by nature, on the northern the housing complexes are changing the slope geometry sets, which can be a trigger for the occurrence of landslide in the short and medium term factor...|$|R
