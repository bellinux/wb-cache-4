5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. <b>Tetanus</b> <b>toxoid</b> should be given if not up to date.|$|E

40|$|Co-vaccination with {{cellular}} pertussis vaccine down-regulates allergic sensitization to diphtheria and tetanus antigens. Using a murine model, {{we investigated}} whether vaccination with diphtheria/ <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoids,</b> administered separately or simultaneously {{with the whole}} cell vaccine of Bordetella pertussis, inhibits subsequent allergen-induced immune and inflammatory responses. Methods: BALB/c-mice were vaccinated intracutaneously {{with a combination of}} diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoids</b> or a combination of diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoids</b> with a whole cell vaccine of Bordetella pertussis (three times, days - 21 to - 7) prior to systemic sensitization (days 1 - 14) and repeated airway challenges (days 28 - 30) with ovalbumin. Results: Compared to negative controls, systemic sensitization and airway allergen challenges induced high serum levels of allergen-specific IgE, predominant Th 2 -type cytokine production, airway inflammation and development of in vivo airway hyperreactivity. Vaccination with diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoids</b> prior to sensitization suppressed IgE formation and development of eosinophilic airway inflammation. Co-vaccination with a whole cell pertussis vaccine inhibited allergen sensitization, airway inflammation and development of in vivo airway hyperreactivity. Prevention was due to an allergen-specific and general shift from a predominant Th 2 towards a predominant Th 1 immune response. Conclusion: Vaccination with diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoids</b> alone or in combination with whole cell pertussis vaccine prior to allergen sensitization prevented allergen-induced Th 2 immune responses.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: During {{the past}} decade, {{a trend toward}} {{increasing}} cases of Bordetella pertussis in older children and adults has been witnessed in Canada. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization now recommends that the adult formulation of the acellular pertussis (adult dTap) vaccine combined with diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoids</b> be substituted for diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoids</b> alone for the 14 - to 16 -year-old booster dose. In October 2000, {{the government of the}} Northwest Territories {{was one of the first}} to adopt adult dTap into their territorial immunization program free of charge...|$|R

25|$|<b>Tetanus</b> <b>toxoid</b> can {{be given}} {{in case of a}} {{suspected}} exposure to tetanus.

It can be given as intravenous therapy or by intramuscular injection.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of simple}} {{molecules}} such as toxoids for immunization tends {{to produce a}} low response by the immune system, and thus poor immune memory. However, adding certain substances to the mixture, for example adsorbing <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoid</b> onto alum, greatly enhances the immune response (see Roitt etc. below). These substances are known as adjuvants. Several different adjuvants {{have been used in}} vaccine preparation. Adjuvants are also used in other ways in researching the immune system.|$|E

40|$|A subanalysis of {{a recent}} cohort {{efficacy}} trial of a pertussis vaccine was performed to determine its efficacy against cough illnesses due to Bordetella parapertussis infections. Infants received four doses of either the Lederle/Takeda acellular pertussis component diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoids</b> and pertussis (DTaP) vaccine or the Lederle whole-cell component diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoids</b> and pertussis (DTP) vaccine at 3, 4. 5, 6, and 15 - 18 months of age; controls received three doses of diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoids</b> (DT) vaccine only. All subjects were prospectively followed for cough illnesses of < or = 7 days' duration; cases of B. parapertussis infection were confirmed by positive culture, household contact, or serology. Seventy-six cough illnesses due to B. parapertussis were identified; 24 occurred in 929 DTaP recipients, 37 in 937 DTP recipients, and 15 in 321 DT recipients, resulting in an efficacy of 50 % for DTaP vaccine (95 % CI [confidence interval], 5 % to 74 %) and 21 % for DTP vaccine (95 % CI, - 45 % to 56 %). The data in the present analysis suggest that the Lederle/Takeda DTaP vaccine but not the Lederle whole-cell component DTP vaccine has efficacy against B. parapertussis infection...|$|R
50|$|DPT (also DTP and DTwP) {{refers to}} a class of {{combination}} vaccines against three infectious diseases in humans: diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), and tetanus.

25|$|Research {{begun in}} the 1970s led to {{clinical}} trials in humans of a hCG birth control vaccine. A phase I (safety) clinical trial examined 15 women from clinics in Helsinki, Finland, Uppsala, Sweden, Bahia, Brazil, and Santiago, Chile with a vaccine formed by conjugating the beta subunit of hCG with a <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoid.</b> The women had previously had tubal ligations. In the trial the immune response was reversible and no significant health issues were found.|$|E
25|$|This was {{followed}} by another phase I trial in 1977-1978 examining previously sterilized women at 5 institutions in India with a more potent vaccine that combined the beta subunit of hCG with the alpha subunit of ovine luteinizing hormone to form a heterospecies dimer conjugated with both <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoid</b> and diphtheria toxoid. The multiple carriers were used because {{it was found that}} a small percentage of women acquired carrier-specific immunosuppression due to repeated injection of conjugates with the same carrier.|$|E
25|$|In 1889, C. tetani was {{isolated}} {{from a human}} victim, by Kitasato Shibasaburō, who later showed that the organism could produce disease when injected into animals, and that the toxin could be neutralized by specific antibodies.

500|$|The team, led by Joseph Giordano, cut off Reagan's [...] "thousand dollar" [...] {{custom-made}} suit {{to examine}} him, much to Reagan's anger. Military officers, {{including the one}} who carried the nuclear football, unsuccessfully tried to prevent FBI agents from confiscating the suit, Reagan's wallet, and other possessions as evidence; the Gold Codes card was in the wallet, and the FBI did not return it until two days later. The medical personnel found that Reagan's systolic blood pressure was 60 versus the normal 140, indicating {{that he was in}} shock, and knew that most 70-year-olds in the president's condition would not survive. Reagan was in excellent physical health, however, and also was shot by the [...]22 caliber instead of the larger [...]38 as was first feared. They treated him with intravenous fluids, oxygen, <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoid,</b> and chest tubes, and surprised Parr—who still believed that he had cracked the president's rib—by finding the entrance gunshot wound. Brady and the wounded agent McCarthy were operated on near the president; when his wife arrived in the emergency room, Reagan remarked to her, [...] "Honey, I forgot to duck", borrowing boxer Jack Dempsey's line to his wife the night he was beaten by Gene Tunney. While intubated, he scribbled to a nurse, [...] "All in all, I'd rather be in Philadelphia", borrowing W. C. Fields' line. Although Reagan came close to death, the team's quick action—and Parr's decision to drive to the hospital instead of the White House—likely saved the president's life, and within 30 minutes Reagan left the emergency room for surgery with normal blood pressure.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this open study was to monitor the long-term effectiveness of the Lederle-Takeda diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoids</b> and acellular pertussis antigen(s) (DTaP) vaccine and the Wyeth-Lederle diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoids</b> and pertussis whole cell (DTP) vaccine in children who had received four doses of vaccine at 3, 4. 5, 6 and 15 months of age during a pertussis vaccine efficacy trial from May 1991 to December 1994. After unblinding of the study code, follow-up information was obtained by use of standardised questionnaires twice a year from 1995 to 2000 to detect clinical pertussis and cough illnesses < or = 14 days duration. Physician confirmation was sought for all reported cases. Rates of reported cough illnesses < or = 14 days duration and rates of parent and physician diagnosed pertussis in former DTaP, DTP and diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoids</b> (DT) recipients were determined and vaccine efficacy was calculated. Nine questionnaires were sent to parents of 2924 study children of whom 349, 1304 and 1271 had originally received DT, DTaP and DTP, respectively. Overall, rates for cough illnesses (per 100 person years) were similar among the vaccine groups suggesting that reporting bias was not a major factor. Calculated efficacy for the 6 -year follow-up period based upon physician diagnosed pertussis was 89 % (95 % CI= 79 94) for DTaP and was 92 % (95 % CI= 84 - 96) for DTP.

Cytochrome P- 450 (P- 450) levels were inhibited more than 50 % at 7 days following a single injection of PT mixed with either vaccine. When combined with DT vaccine, 125 ng of PT was required to produce this effect, while as little as 16 ng of PT combined with APDT vaccine inhibited P- 450 levels. The inhibition of P- 450 levels {{is similar to that}} observed after a single injection of diphtheria and <b>tetanus</b> <b>toxoids</b> and pertussis vaccine adsorbed (DTP). Alterations of P- 450 levels were accompanied by increased activities of quinone reductase but not with changes in plasma interleukin- 6 or tumor necrosis factor levels. Other Bordetella pertussis virulence factors, such as filamentous hemagglutinin, fimbriae and pertactin, were also tested but had no significant effect on hepatic drug metabolism. Endotoxin or preparations containing endotoxin caused alterations in hepatic drug metabolism within 24 h, concomitant with increased interleukin- 6 and tumor necrosis factor levels, but these effects had resolved by 1 week. DTP vaccine and preparations containing PT caused a marked induction of gamma interferon coincident with the maximal inhibition of P- 450 levels. This effect was not present with DT or APDT vaccine alone, nor with endotoxin or any combination of factors that did not contain PT. These results demonstrate that PT is a necessary component for the sustained effects of DTP vaccine on hepatic drug metabolism and suggest a role for gamma interferon in this process...|$|R
