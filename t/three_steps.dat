5|$|Tbr1, {{along with}} Pax6 and Tbr2, {{has a role}} in glutamatergic {{projection}} neuron differentiation. Glutamatergic neurons make and release in an activity-dependent manner the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate {{as opposed to the}} inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The transition from radial glial cells to postmitotic projection neurons occurs in <b>three</b> <b>steps,</b> each associated with one of the aforementioned transcription factors. The first starts out with the expression of Pax6 in radial glial cells found primarily at the ventricular surface. In the next step, Pax6 is downregulated and Tbr2 is expressed as the cell differentiates into an intermediate progenitor cell. Likewise, in the final step, Tbr2 is extremely downregulated to undetectable levels as Tbr1 signals the transition into a postmitotic projection neuron.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The motion {{estimation}} and compensation technique {{is widely used}} for inter frame video coding applications. There are many computational effective block {{motion estimation}} search algorithms but with trade-off between the algorithm accuracy and algorithm speed. In this paper, following search algorithms are implemented, full search, <b>three</b> <b>step</b> search and two dimensional search. Initially motion estimation and compensation is done on natural images. Secondly, to remove the spatial redundancies in the image, DWT is applied to images before motion estimation and compensation. On the images obtained from approximate, horizontal, vertical and diagonal coefficients, full search motion estimation is applied. From the results, it is concluded that <b>three</b> <b>step</b> search method is simple & near optimal performance. Computational complexity of <b>three</b> <b>step</b> search is almost 10 times less than full search algorithm while PSNR of <b>three</b> <b>step</b> search is less only by one-two percent than full search method. Two dimensional search method uses fewer computations than <b>three</b> <b>step</b> search method but with less PSNR. And Full search motion estimation with DWT reduces computations without affecting PSNR. Index Terms — Motion estimation, full search, fast search, block motion estimation. I...|$|R

The next couple of decades saw a rise in popularity of the Maine Coon, with championship victories and an increase in national rankings. In 1985, the state of Maine announced that the breed would be named the official State Cat. Today the Maine Coon is the third most popular cat breed, according to the number of kittens registered with the CFA.|$|E

40|$|Ship {{recycling}} operations expose {{workers to}} a wide range of hazards that can cause a large number of incidents and accidents resulting in ill health, injuries and even death. In order to facilitate effective risk reduction within ship recycling yards, there is a need to develop an appropriate risk assessment method that is supportive and simple to use. In addition, the utilised method should involve end-user participation which is very important in assisting the realisation and acceptance of required health and safety measures. In this paper, a new bespoke risk assessment methodology for ship recycling, ‘The <b>Three</b> <b>Step</b> Risk Assessment Method for Ship Recycling’ (<b>Three</b> <b>Step</b> Method) will be presented which fulfils the criteria’s mentioned above. This paper will document the <b>Three</b> <b>Step</b> Method’s development and explain its various steps of implementation before introducing a case study and feedback of a practical application of the method. Finally, the conclusions that the <b>Three</b> <b>Step</b> Method provides a proven useful dialogue in the identification, assessment and mitigation of hazards and that the method can be easily implemented in the ship repair industry will be made...|$|R
40|$|Several {{problems}} still {{limit the}} {{full use of}} the diagnostic potential of immunoscintigraphy (IS) with technetium- 99 m labelled monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) 225 - 28 S directed to high molecular weight melanoma associated antigen (HMW-MAA). The principal problem is the unfavourable ratio of tumour to non-tumour activity (T/nT), due to the poor tumour uptake and the high aspecific uptake of the tissue surrounding the tumour. Recently, it was demonstrated that using the tumour pretargeting technique based on the injection of monoclonal antibody and the avidin/biotin system (<b>three</b> <b>step</b> immunoscintigraphy), an improvement in the T/nT ratio can be obtained in patients with carcinoembryonic antigen secreting tumours. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the diagnostic sensitivity of traditional immunoscintigraphy with that of <b>three</b> <b>step</b> immunoscintigraphy in seven patients with uveal melanoma. All the patients underwent immunoscintigraphy with MoAb 225. 28 S radiolabelled with technetium- 99 m, and a <b>three</b> <b>step</b> immunoscintigraphy 1 week later. No patients demonstrated immediate toxic effects after receiving the reagents, no matter which of the two methods was used. The traditional immunoscintigraphy had a diagnostic sensitivity of 71. 4 %, diagnosing five out of seven melanomas tested. The <b>three</b> <b>step</b> study detected all the melanomas examined (7 / 7) with a diagnostic sensitivity of 100 % and showed a drastic reduction in background.
