5|$|According to Russell's {{outlook on}} power, {{there are four}} {{conditions}} under which power ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pursued</b> with moral conviction. First, it must be pursued only {{as a means to}} some end, and not as an end in itself; moreover, if it is an end in itself, then it must be of comparatively lower value than one's other goals. Second, the ultimate goal must be to help satisfy the desires of others. Third, the means by which one pursues one's goal must not be egregious or malign, such that they outweigh the value of the end; as (for instance) the gassing of children for the sake of future democracy (Russell 1938:201). Fourth, moral doctrines should aim toward truth and honesty, not the manipulation of others (Russell 1938:216–218).|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Bond's stolen {{truck is}} intercepted along its escape route by a SPECTRE helicopter, but 007 destroys the attacking {{aircraft}} by shooting its co-pilot with his sniper rifle, causing {{the man to}} drop a live hand grenade in the cockpit. Thus, Bond and Romanova make it to Grant's escape boat on the Dalmatian coast and steal that, too, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pursued</b> by Morzeny, who leads a squadron of SPECTRE powerboats. Bond, however, escapes by dumping his own powerboat's fuel drums overboard and detonating them with a Very flare to engulf all the chase boats {{in a sea of}} flames.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War and Britain's heavy involvement in this conflict led to a flurry of orders being issued; the need for capable modern interceptors was felt to be so pressing that the RAF was willing to consider accepting interim fighter aircraft while more capable fighters would continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pursued.</b> In particular, the RAF felt that a pair of proposed fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft and Supermarine were of high importance and thus placed orders for these proposed fighters 'off the drawing board' in 1950. The reasoning behind these two aircraft being ordered in 1950 was intended to serve as an insurance policy in the event of either one of these projects failing to produce a viable aircraft; these two aircraft would later become known as the Supermarine Swift and the Hawker Hunter respectively.|$|E
5|$|The two liberal {{governments of}} César Gaviria (1990-1994) and Ernesto Samper (1994-1998) pursued {{a policy of}} {{economic}} opening and business modernization. In the spirit of these policies, the government established a comprehensive new sector policy that aimed at increasing water and sanitation investments through targeted transfers to municipalities, improving service quality and efficiency by promoting private sector participation in the poorest {{parts of the country}} where public utilities were not performing well, the establishment of autonomous regulatory agencies at the national level, increased cost recovery, and protecting the poorest through cross-subsidies in the form of area-based tariffs. The basis of this sector policy was established by Law 142 of July 1994, at the end of president César Gaviria’s term of office. With some modifications to that law in 2001, the same policy continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pursued</b> to today despite several changes of governments.|$|E

25|$|Minna's {{relationship}} with Wagner was stormy: Wagner was jealous and possessive {{and there were}} frequent loud arguments which usually ended with Minna in tears. However, {{by the time the}} company returned to Magdeburg to open the season in October 1834 the two were lovers, and by February 1835 Wagner wrote to his brother Alfred that he and Minna were engaged, although to Wagner's fury Minna continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pursued</b> by other suitors. In November 1835 Minna, dissatisfied with the Magdeburg troupe and probably with Wagner as well, left suddenly to take on a role at the Königstadt Theatre in Berlin. Wagner was wild with despair and implored her to come back and marry him. Minna eventually agreed to return, but stayed only {{to the end of the}} season in Magdeburg before heading to Königsberg to join the local theatre company, while Wagner looked for work in Berlin. Failing in this, he joined Minna in Königsberg and accepted a menial position as a junior conductor. Minna married Wagner in Tragheim Church on 26 November 1836, where they argued even in front of the minister who was to marry them.|$|E

The manifesto declared that supporting the war was an act of resistance against the aggression of the German Empire, and that the war had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>pursued</b> until its defeat. At this point, the authors conjectured, the ruling political parties of Germany would be overthrown and the anarchist goal of the emancipation of Europe and of the German people would be advanced.|$|E
