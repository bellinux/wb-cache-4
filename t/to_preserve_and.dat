5|$|Rogers {{avoided the}} American Locomotive Company (ALCO) merger in 1901 through closing and reopening as Rogers Locomotive Works. The company {{remained}} independent until 1905, when ALCO purchased it; ALCO continued building new steam locomotives at the Rogers plant until 1913. ALCO used the Rogers facilities through the 1920s as a parts storage facility and warehouse, but eventually sold {{the property to}} private investors. Today, several Rogers-built locomotives exist in railroad museums around the world, and the plant's erecting shop is preserved as the Thomas Rogers Building; it is the current location of the Paterson Museum, whose mission is <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>and</b> display Paterson's industrial history.|$|E

5|$|There are {{virtually}} no {{parts of the}} world left where the weapon dance is directly connected with imminent or recent combat. This is especially true of European states, which have long since moved away from the tribalism that usually gives rise to such folk dances. It is, however, also true of {{parts of the world}} where tribal traditions have succumbed to colonialism and the forces of globalism. The dances that one sees today are often part of general movements <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>and</b> rejuvenate tribal or local traditions. Some of these movements are quite strong now, such as those among native North American tribes and the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>and</b> {{restore the}} Orangery, the Trust teamed-up with City of Bath College and Nimbus Conservation Ltd in an {{innovative}} partnership, whereby 12 trainee stonemasons worked alongside professional craftsmen to hone {{their skills and}} carry out the specialist stonework needed. The Trust also introduced workshops for other restoration professionals, academics and eventually opened them to interested members of the public, where all were educated in a hands-on environment in the skills required to repair the building. For this crafts-based training initiative, in 2011 the Trust won a Daily Telegraph sponsored English Heritage Angel Award.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} studies have been carried out on the creek and its watershed. These include the Darby Creek Stream Valley Park Master Plan in 1987 and the Greenway Plan for the Darby Creek Watershed in 2011. A $1047 Pennsylvania Growing Greener grant was given to Delco Anglers and Conservationists for {{riparian}} restoration on Darby Creek. Another Growing Greener grant, this one for $68,225, was given to Marple Township for a streambank stabilization project on the creek. Additionally, a $1000 grant from the Pennsylvania Watershed Restoration Assistance Program was given to Delco Anglers and Conservationists for riparian improvement of the creek and several other creeks. In 1997, a $60,000 grant was given to the Darby Creek Valley Association and DelCo Anglers and Conservationists for developing a conservation plan. The grant was provided by the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Darby Creek Valley Association is an organization whose purpose is <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>and</b> improve the creek's watershed. It has approximately 100 members.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Italian Heavy Draft's early {{popularity}} as {{a strong}} but fast draft horse, increasing mechanization in the farming and military sectors reduced the need for all draft horses, and population numbers declined. In the 1970s, selection processes were changed {{to focus on the}} production of animals for horse meat, and that has continued to be the primary focus through the present time. In 1976, a breed association was formed in Italy <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>and</b> promote the Italian Heavy Draft. The association is charged with maintaining the stud book, evaluating breeding stock, granting equine passports, maintaining genetic databases, and exhibiting the breed. The main breeding areas for the Italian Heavy Draft are in the plains and hills around Verona, Padova, Vicenza, Venice, Treviso and Udine. In 2005, it was estimated that there were just under 6,500 Italian Heavy Drafts, about half of which were mares. The registered population at the end of 2010 was 6304, with the largest numbers in Lazio and Umbria; the number of unregistered Heavy Drafts is not reported.|$|E

5|$|Destiny 2 {{was later}} ported to the PSP. Development began in 2005, after the {{commercial}} success of Eternias PSP port. The port {{was developed by}} Alfa System, a frequent collaborator with the Tales team on spin-off titles. The project was directed by Yoshito Higuchi, who had worked on Destiny 2 and became {{the director of the}} GameCube port of Tales of Symphonia. While the earlier port of Destiny made significant changes, the Destiny 2 port was meant <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>and</b> add onto the content of the original. Some of the adjustments included minor tweaks to gameplay, adjustments to fit the PSP's control layout, and adjusting the graphics from 4:3 to 16:9 screen ratio. A new dungeon featuring added story elements was also created. It was released on February 15, 2007.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rule}} of the {{succeeding}} Hanoverian dynasty, power was gradually exercised more by parliament and the government. The first Hanoverian monarch, George I, relied on his ministers {{to a greater extent than}} had previous monarchs. Later Hanoverian monarchs attempted to restore royal control over legislation: George III and George IV both openly opposed Catholic Emancipation and asserted that to grant assent to a Catholic emancipation bill would violate the Coronation Oath, which required the sovereign <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>and</b> protect the established Church of England from Papal domination, and would grant rights to individuals who were in league with a foreign power which did not recognise their legitimacy. However, George IV reluctantly granted his assent upon the advice of his ministers. Thus, as the concept of ministerial responsibility has evolved, the power to withhold royal assent has fallen into disuse, both in the United Kingdom and in the other Commonwealth realms.|$|E
5|$|Enthusiasts {{worked to}} reorient the breed towards driving and {{recreation}} pursuits, and since 1982 have again reorganized the breed association. In 1992, a new studbook {{was created for}} the breed, with new selection criteria designed to preserve {{the quality of the}} breed, particularly its gaits. The latest editions of the breed registry and studbook are controlled by the Syndicat national des éleveurs et utilisateurs de chevaux Cob normand (SNEUCCN, National Union of Farmers and Users of Normandy Cob Horses), based in Tessy-sur-Vire. The association works <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>and</b> promote the breed throughout France, focusing especially on Normandy, Vendee and Anjou. In 1994, Normandy contained 2000 Percheron and Norman Cob horses, and annually bred around 600 foals of these two breeds. This included approximately half of the Norman Cobs bred in France.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) {{acquired}} the land containing the spring {{for the expansion}} of the nearby Sembawang Air Base, leaving F with less than 4 hectares (10 acres) of land. Its water-bottling plant survived until the early 1990s however. In January 2002, locals' interest to the hot spring, which had caught the attention of Singaporeans after the surrounding land had been cleared to begin the RSAF air base extension. Sembawang community leaders gathered signatures to petition Mindef, which was going to fence off the area, <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>and</b> develop the hot spring for the general public. Mindef gave the green light to the appeals and opened a small side gate pavement for the public to access the spring.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers aim for a {{moisture}} content of 50-to-52 percent and a fat-in-dry-matter content of 35-to-40 percent. A {{study published in}} the International Journal of Food & Science Technology found that a 12.5:87.5 blend of vetch milk and bovine milk improved stretchiness and melting characteristics. Vetch is a legume that has seeds which are similar to lentils. An experiment published in the International Journal of Dairy Technology suggested that the level of galactose, a monosaccharide sugar that is less sweet than glucose and fructose, can be reduced using different culture techniques. An article in the International Journal of Food Engineering found that trisodium citrate, a food additive used <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>and</b> add flavor to foods, slightly improved the preferred qualities of pizza cheese. Research published in Dairy Industries International suggested that denatured whey proteins increased moisture retention, but that the improvements were very slight and not economically worthwhile relative to the minor improvements.|$|E
