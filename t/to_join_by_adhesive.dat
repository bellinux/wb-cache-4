The {{crack arrest}} {{capabilities}} and the load bearing {{characteristic of a}} stiffened and unstiffened panel subjected to uniform remote displacement field is examined in this paper. A four stringer stiffened wide panel is analyzed for a center crack, propagating towards the adjacent stringers. The linear elastic analyses indicated a decrease in stress intensity factor when the crack approaches the stiffener. The non-linear analysis with crack across the skin-stringer assembly indicated a reduction in strength relative to an unstiffened panel. The continual need for light weight, large scale metallic structure has brought about {{a new set of}} problems related to fracture. In aircrafts weight is a critical problem, and can be addressed by using a thin skin and stringers. Stringers are usually <b>joined</b> <b>to</b> the skin using rivets or <b>by</b> <b>adhesive</b> bonding. Crack growth in stiffened panels <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> rivets has been studied extensively [1, 2] when compared <b>to</b> stiffened panels <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> <b>adhesive.</b> Fracture analyse...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Medical {{implants}} and prostheses (artificial hips, tendono- and ligament plasties) {{usually are}} multi-component systems {{that may be}} machined from one of three material classes: metals, plastics and ceramics. Typically, the body-sided bonding element is bone. The purpose of this contribution is to describe developments carried out to optimize the techniques, connecting prosthesis to bone, <b>to</b> be <b>joined</b> <b>by</b> an <b>adhesive</b> bone cement at their interface. Although bonding of organic polymers to inorganic or organic surfaces and to bone has a long history, there remains a serious obstacle in realizing long-term high-bonding strengths in the in vivo body environment of ever present high humidity. Therefore, different pretreatments, individually adapted to the actual combination of materials, are needed to assure long term adhesive strength and stability against hydrolysis. This pretreatment for metal alloys may be silica layering; for PE-plastics, a specific plasma activation; and for bone, amphiphilic layering systems such that the hydrophilic properties of bone become better adapted to the hydrophobic properties of the bone cement. Amphiphilic layering systems are related to those developed in dentistry for dentine bonding. Specific pretreatment can significantly increase bond strengths, particularly after long term immersion in water under conditions {{similar to those in}} the human body. The bond strength between bone and plastic for example can be increased by a factor approaching 50 (pealing work increasing from 30 N/m to 1500 N/m). This review article summarizes the multi-disciplined subject of adhesion and adhesives, considering the technology involved in the formation and mechanical performance of adhesives joints inside the human body. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Joining</b> <b>by</b> <b>adhesive</b> bonding gains more {{interest}} for structural compounds, {{because there are}} many advantages in comparison to mechanical or thermal joining techniques. In addition to the environmental performance, gluing can increase cycle time in the process, while the substrates experienced no mechanical or thermal stress. The increasing applications require also a method for debonding for repairing and recycling processes. Particularly for structural adhesive bonding it does not exist today. The presented research on debondable adhesives includes exothermic reacting materials, which are inactive during the life cycle and can be activated by microwave radiation (MW). Ionic liquids (IL) have been used as microwave absorber and, additionally, can release heat energy during the decomposition through their positive enthalpy of formation. The endothermic reaction can be used to initiate the decomposition of the added blowing agent and oxidizer, which destroys the polymeric matrix and generate additionally a mechanical blowing effect...|$|R
