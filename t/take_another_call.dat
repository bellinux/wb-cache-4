50|$|When in the maxi-minimum range (8-9 support points), {{and holding}} two cards in opener's major and five cards in opener's minor, you {{are worried about}} passing and missing game when partner has some extra-values. So you take '{{preference}}' to two of opener's major. This keeps the bidding alive and allows partner to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>call</b> even though your preference would in fact be for the minor.|$|E
50|$|The AT&E {{registers}} {{looked after}} all the dialling, and there were three sorts of registers:loop-disconnect, MF (later called DTMF), and incoming. The local registers (loop-disconnect and MF) took care of own-exchange and outgoing calls, while the incoming registers dealt with calls coming into the exchange. A local register would provide dial tone to the subscriber, wait for the first dialled digit, and then apply to the translator to see what action was required. The translator could decide by the first digit {{if it was a}} local call, and if it was it would instruct the register to come back when it had all the digits. If it was not a local call and therefore to be routed out of the exchange, then it would tell the register to come back with each digit until it could decide on the routing, as not all calls went to the GSC (Group Switching Centre) as there was AAR (alternative available routing). Once the routing had been decided and digits passed on, the register was free to <b>take</b> <b>another</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First Roman-Jewish War, the Sicarii, and (possibly) Zealot helpers (Josephus differentiated between the two but did not explain the main differences in depth), gained access to Jerusalem and committed a series of atrocities in order to force the population out of docility and into war against Rome. In one account, given in the Talmud, they destroyed the city's food supply so that the people would be forced to fight against the Roman siege instead of negotiating peace. Their leaders, including Menahem ben Yehuda and Eleazar ben Ya'ir, were important figures in the war, and the group fought in many battles against the Romans as soldiers. Together {{with a small group of}} followers, Menahem made his way to the fortress of Masada, took over a Roman garrison and slaughtered all 700 soldiers there. They also <b>took</b> over <b>another</b> fortress <b>called</b> Antonia and overpowered the troops of Agrippa II. He also trained them to conduct various guerrilla operations on Roman convoys and legions stationed around Judea.|$|R

50|$|It {{was built}} by Croatian army general Ivan Lenković, a captain of the Uskoks, on the hill Nehaj. Finished in 1558, it {{was built on the}} remains of ruined churches, monasteries and houses which were {{situated}} outside of the walls of Senj. These buildings were scrapped since it was concluded that they would not survive anyway if they were outside the city walls, as the Ottomans would loot them or use them as housing during sieges. The fortress was mainly built to fight the Ottoman Empire, and {{to be used as a}} base for the Uskoks. The Uskoks (who built and inhabited the fort) were great enemies of the Ottomans, as they had previously <b>taken</b> <b>another</b> city <b>called</b> Klis, where the Uskoks used to reside. Before the fortress was built, Senj had been besieged three times, but none succeeded; after the fort was built, the fortress or Senj were not attacked again. However, the Uskoks were also known to be the enemies of the Venetians, as the Venetians were quite aggressive toward the Croatian coastal cities.The Venetians viewed them as pirates, since they would plunder and sink their ships. They were known to travel as far as Istria and plunder Venetian ships. In fact, the Venetians were so disturbed by the Uskok attacks that they had a war with Austria (which Senj was a part of at that time). One of the peace terms was the banishment of the Uskoks. The Emperor did banish the Uskoks and that was their end. However, during the hundred years that they were active they stood by their oath of vengeance towards all their enemies which they took when their former fortress of Klis was conquered by the Ottomans in 1537. The Uskoks and the Fortress successfully held the border and kept invaders away, as the fortress was never conquered or torn down.|$|R

The three-phase cross federation [1, 10] and mobile-agent based cloud federation [3] are examples of the horizontal IaaS federation in which a home cloud rents virtual machines from foreign clouds without considering full network virtualization.|$|R
