40|$|Nowadays, <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>systems</b> play an {{important}} role for preserving the connection between the rails and sleepers in various conditions. In this paper, stress based concept is used to develop a comprehensive approach for fatigue reliability analysisof fastening spring clip. Axle load, speed and material properties are assumed to be random variables. First, track and train models are analyzed dynamically in order to achieve displacement time history of fas-tening spring clip. Then this displacement time history is applied to the fastening spring clip in FE software to obtain variable ampli-tude of stresses. Crack nucleation life is calculated by rain-flow method and Palmgren-Miner linear damage rule. First Order Relia-bility Method (FORM) and Monte-Carlosimulation technique are employed for the reliability index estimations. The influences of various random variables on the probability of failure are investi-gated by sensitivity analysis. The results show that the equivalent stress range and material parameter have significant effect on fa-tigue crack nucleation...|$|E
40|$|LKAB {{intends to}} {{increase}} the production of iron ore in the upcoming years. To prevent problems with the capacity along Malmbanan (The Iron Ore Line) {{an increase in the}} maximum permissible axle load is required. The first step is an increase from 30 ton to 32. 5 ton. The vision is {{to increase the}} axle load in 4 steps of 32. 5 - 35 - 37. 5 – 40 ton, where an axle load of 40 ton is the final goal. The report deals with the influence of an increased axle load for each track component. This is in order to present the deterioration of the track quality when the axle load is increased. Different methods of track maintenance and reinforcements will also be discussed. The work is focused on the southern circuit of Malmbanan. Track conditions on individual track sections will not be considered. The work only includes the track structure i. e. signaling systems and power supply systems will not be considered. Economical calculations of reinforcement and maintenance activities is left for future investigations. The working process has included a literature study, field study, computational study and an interview study. This has led to an assessment of to what extent each track component is affected by an increase in maximum permissible axle load. The rail will be exposed to a higher amount of wear, an increased risk for rail defects and plastic deformation of the rail head. Rail damage is most easily prevented by rail grinding and rail lubrication in sharp curves. More extensive measures are to replace the rail with a stronger rail steel or replace with a larger rail profile. The rail fastenings will be affected by higher track forces and are particularly exposed in sharp curves. <b>The</b> <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>systems</b> has to be replaced gradually when increasing the permissible axle load. The only fastening device, in use today, that will be approved for 40 ton axle load is the Fastclip and the strongest e-clips with plastic rail pads. The lifetime of the sleepers will be shortened with an increased axle load. A critical factor is the bending moment at the position of the rail {{and in the middle of}} the sleeper. According to the performed calculations all sleeper models eventually have to be replaced, except sleeper model A 22. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the sleeper strength for some models. Strength tests for each specific sleeper model should therefore be carried out. It is recommended that a research study is performed to gain knowledge about the track position and model for all the fastening systems and sleepers along the track. This in order to ease future track upgrades. A higher axle load leads to an accelerated deterioration of the ballast. Ballast cleaning is recommended in the near future to reduce the rate of ballast contamination. The ballast thickness should not be less than 50 cm, according to performed calculations. An increased axle load will cause an increased need for maintenance of the track substructure. Reinforcements have to be carried out on several bridges and culverts. This also applies to the geotechnics, which is mainly reinforced by pressure banks at track sections with poor subgrade. A complete investigation of the bearing capacity of the track subgrade should be performed. This in order to find track sections with insufficient bearing capacity. An investigation of the load carrying capacity for all bridges along the southern circuit of Malmbanan should also be performed...|$|E

40|$|Pandrol Rail Fastenings Limited are a {{designer}} and manufacturer of railway rail-fastening systems. As an organisation {{they have the}} capability to reduce the noise impact of bridges using resilient track components. They also have a commercial interest in providing such technology. Knowledge of the processes behind bridge noise is important to Pandrol in two ways; to aid the engineers within the organisation in the design of <b>fastening</b> <b>systems</b> and to demonstrate a state-of-the-art understanding of the problem of railway bridge noise to customers, as this will aid in the sale of Pandrol products. The fitting of new rail components to an existing track form, or failure to meet noise regulations with a new track form, can be costly. It is important to be able to predict accurately the effectiveness of noise reduction techniques. Currently, Pandrol’s knowledge of the problem consists almost entirely of experience gained and data gathered while working on existing bridge projects. To expand their knowledge base, Pandrol perform noise and vibration measurements on railway bridges and viaducts and then use the measured data to predict the performance of their systems on other bridges. This completely empirical approach to predicting bridge noise is both costly and situation specific results cannot be provided before the installation of the <b>fastening</b> <b>system.</b> ii Another approach to predicting bridge noise is through the application of analytical models. Limited analytical modelling in the context of bridge noise is currently conducted within the organisation. For these reasons, Pandrol are sponsoring research into bridge noise in the form of this EngD project. Here an existing rapid calculation approach is identified that relies less on the exact geometry of the bridge and more on its general characteristics. In this approach an analytical model of the track is coupled to a statistical energy analysis (SEA) model of the bridge. This approach forms a suitable basis from which to develop a better model here by concentrating on its weaknesses. A mid-frequency calculation for the power input to the bridge via a resilient track system has been developed by modelling the track-bridge system as two finite Timoshenko beams continuously connected by a resilient layer. This has resulted in a power input calculation which includes the important effects of coupling between <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and bridge and the resonance effects of the finite length of a bridge. In addition, a detailed study of the frequency characteristics of deep I-section beams has been performed using Finite Element, Boundary Element and Dynamic stiffness models. It is shown that, at high frequencies, the behaviour of the beam is characterised by in-plane motion of the beam web and bending motion in the flange. This knowledge has resulted in an improved calculation for the mobility of a bridge at high frequencies. The above improvements are included in an improved model for use by Pandrol in their general activities. Data from real bridges is compared to predictions from the improved model in order to validate different aspects of the model. The model is then used to study the effect on noise of varying many bridge design parameters. It is shown that the parameter that has most influence on the noise performance of a bridge is the dynamic stiffness of <b>the</b> resilient <b>rail</b> <b>fastening</b> <b>system.</b> Additionally it is demonstrated that for a given bridge and noise receiver location, an optimum fastener stiffness exists where the noise radiated by the bridge and track is at a minimum.

30|$|According to a model {{proposed}} by Remington and Witting [46], {{the generation of}} bridge-borne noise {{can be divided into}} three steps: first, as the train passes, the wheel–rail interaction causes <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> and wheel to vibrate; second, the vibratory energy is then transmitted to the bridge structure through <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> <b>fastening,</b> causing various structural components of the bridge to vibrate; and third, the vibrating bridge components, rails, and wheels then radiate sound. This model used the combined wheel–rail roughness as the external excitation. Once the total power input of the bridge was calculated, the distribution of power throughout the bridge structure was determined using simple SEA. Finally, the total sound power radiated by the bridge was calculated using the radiation efficiency of each component. Because this model only accounted for <b>the</b> <b>rail’s</b> vertical bending and traveling wave, no wave transmission in <b>the</b> <b>rail</b> was modeled at frequencies below the decoupling one, which is not reasonable. Remington and Witting then compared the noise radiated by an open-deck viaduct with and without <b>rail</b> fastenings; <b>the</b> measured noise levels were compared with the ones computed by the above model. According to the theoretical calculation, the noise level would be reduced by 2  dB(A) after installing elastic <b>rail</b> fastenings; <b>the</b> actual reduction was 4  dB(A), indicating that the computed results were reasonable. The theoretical model was used further to investigate the effectiveness of several noise reduction measures, and elastic rail fastenings were shown to be the most effective (maximum noise reduction: 10  dB(A)).|$|R
