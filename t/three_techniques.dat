500|$|Guidelines {{have been}} set up by various {{governing}} bodies regarding the standards that are followed by practicing forensic scientists. [...] For forensic chemists, the international Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs (SWGDRUG) presents recommendations for the quality assurance and quality control of tested materials. [...] In the identification of unknown samples, protocols have been grouped into three categories based on the probability for false positives. [...] Instruments and protocols in category A are considered the best for uniquely identifying an unknown material, followed by categories B and then C. [...] To ensure the accuracy of identifications SWGDRUG recommends that multiple tests using different instruments be performed on each sample, and that one category A technique and at least one other technique be used. [...] If a category A technique is not available, or the forensic chemist decides not to use one, SWGDRUG recommends that at least <b>three</b> <b>techniques</b> be used, two of which must be from category B. [...] Combination instruments, such as GC-MS, are considered two separate tests as long as the results are compared to known values individually [...] For example, the GC elution times would be compared to known values along with the MS spectra. [...] If both of those match a known substance, no further tests are needed.|$|E

2500|$|Dunbar et al. also {{obtained}} X-ray crystallographic {{data for}} the TBP crystals at different temperatures. With respect to Figure 11, the equatorial Fe(1) atom is on the left, Fe(2) {{is in the middle}} and Fe(3) is on the right. Crystallographic data showed that the average M-L bond lengths for Fe(2) and Fe(3) ions to their respective cyanide ligands at 30 K were 1.94 Å and 1.95 Å and 1.96 Å and 1.96 Å at 110 K, respectively,. This is typical and representative of a LS FeII bond distance. The Fe(1) was significantly higher at 2.11 Å suggesting significant HS FeII character even though typical values reported for HS FeII sites are slightly higher. Typically, bond lengths determined by X-ray crystallography show a small decrease at increasing temperatures due to an increase in the amplitude of atom vibrations, which is the case seen here above 110 K for the average Co-N bond lengths (1.90 Å at 200 K and 1.89 Å at 298 K for the top axial CoIII ion and 1.88 Å at 200 K and 1.84 Å at 298 K for the bottom axial CoIII ion, Figure 11). This however, is not the case for the Fe-N bonds which show a systematic increase. At room temperature, 298 K, the average bond lengths for Fe(1) at 2.17 Å [...] and Fe(3) at 2.15 Å, are typical for HS FeII. The temperature induced change in the cluster geometry indicates a spin transition at these FeII sites. The Fe(2) site does not show a complete spin transition at room temperature however, with an average bond length of only 1.97 Å. Close examination of the crystal structure reveals that Fe(2) is slightly different from the other FeII equatorial sites, in that the 3, 4, 7, 8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, (tmphen), ligands on the Fe(1) and Fe(3) centers are engaged in intramolecular p-p interactions with both of the tmphen ligands on the Fe(2) center. With the information provided by these <b>three</b> <b>techniques,</b> it can be concluded that the FeII centers in this pentanuclear complex undergo SCO and that the phenomenon is affected by its coordination and solvent environment.|$|E
