5|$|In 2004, Philbin {{returned}} to host 12 episodes of a spin-off program titled Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire in which contestants could potentially win $10,000,000. ABC aired five episodes of this spin-off {{during the week}} of February 22, 2004, and an additional seven episodes later that year in May. As usual, contestants had <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> series of 15 multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty, but the dollar values rose substantially. The first five questions for Super Millionaire were worth $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 (the first safe haven), the remaining ten questions were worth $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 (the second safe haven), $500,000, $1,000,000, $2,500,000, $5,000,000, and $10,000,000.|$|E
5|$|The Maschinenpistole 40 ("Machine pistol 40") {{descended from}} its {{predecessor}} the MP 38, {{which was in}} turn based on the MP 36, a prototype made of machined steel. The MP 36 was developed independently by Erma Werke's Berthold Geipel with funding from the German Army. It took design elements from Heinrich Vollmer's VPM 1930 and EMP. Vollmer then worked on Berthold Geipel's MP 36 and in 1938 submitted a prototype <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> request from the Heereswaffenamt (Army Weapons Office) for a new submachine gun, which was adopted as MP 38. The MP 38 was a simplification of the MP 36, and the MP 40 was a further simplification of the MP 38, with certain cost-saving alterations, most notably in the more extensive use of stamped steel rather than machined parts.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years later}} Phips was {{appointed}} as governor. He had successfully straddled a middle political position, cultivating a strong {{connection to the}} powerful New England minister, Increase Mather, {{as well as his}} royalist opposition on the Board of Trade. Phips and Mather returned to the Massachusetts Bay Colony from England {{at the height of the}} witchcraft delusion, after numerous executions in Salem. Phips suspended the court proceedings, pardoned several people sentenced to death, and released more than 100 being held in jail before trial. He became enmeshed in related controversies that resulted in his recall to England <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> variety of charges. Phips died in London at the age of 44 before the charges against him could be heard.|$|E

5|$|During the 1580s, Coke became intimately {{linked with}} the Howard family, the Dukes of Norfolk and Earls of Arundel. His uncle Thomas Gawdy had close links to Earl Arundel himself. In Norfolk Arundel held a liberty– he was {{essentially}} a local prince who appointed all officials, maintained his own prison, executed justice and bribed any royal clerks. His power base was his household, particularly the network of lawyers and stewards who held his estates together. Coke's uncle Thomas Gawdy had served as Steward to the Third Duke of Norfolk, and during the 1580s Coke was employed by the Howards to counter lawyers employed by the Crown, who argued that the Howards' lands were forfeit owing to the treason of the 4th Duke. As well as defeating these direct attacks Coke traveled to Cardiff <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> challenge by Francis Dacre, son of William Dacre, 3rd Baron Dacre and uncle-in-law to the 4th Duke's three sons, Philip Howard and his two half-brothers, Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk and Lord William Howard– he proved that Dacre's evidence was false and had the case dismissed.|$|E
5|$|They {{finished}} 8–3 in 1941, {{and held}} a ceremony to honor the future Hall of Famer Leemans in the final regular season game on December 7, 1941. Leemans {{had been with the}} Giants since 1936, when he led the league in rushing as a rookie with 830yards. A versatile performer, he rushed for over 3,000yards, and passed for over 2,300 in his career. During the course of the game the stadium announcer paged Colonel William Joseph Donovan <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> call from Washington, D.C., and told all servicemen to return to their units, but it was only when the game concluded that players and spectators learned of the attack on the naval base at Pearl Harbor earlier that day. New York advanced to the championship game following the season, in which they lost to the Bears 37–9. Both the 1940 and 1941 championship games were close early before their respective opponents went on an offensive surge to break the games open late. In 1942 and 1943, the Giants totalled an 11–8–2 record and failed to make the postseason.|$|E

25|$|A {{recent study}} found that lying takes longer than telling the truth, and thus the time <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> {{question}} may be used as a method of lie detection. However, it has also been shown that instant-answers can be proof of a prepared lie. The only compromise is to try to surprise the victim and find a midway answer, not too quick, nor too long.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, in its {{documentary}} series Inside Story, in 1978 produced a programme on the Tamam Shud case, entitled The Somerton Beach Mystery, where reporter Stuart Littlemore investigated the case, including interviewing Boxall, who could add no new {{information on the}} case, and Paul Lawson, who made the plaster cast of the body, and who refused <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> question about whether anyone had positively identified the body.|$|E

25|$|The {{first phase}} of the study was {{designed}} mainly by Christopher Gillberg and Peder Rasmussen. Initially, preschool teachers in all areas of Gothenburg were asked <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> questionnaire with a series of yes and no questions to identify children that possibly had MBD. (The questionnaire was based on an earlier pilot study.) The researchers used a purely operational (symptom-based) definition of MBD that had been devised especially for the study and was later termed DAMP.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{researchers}} {{predicted that}} when human knowledge could be expressed using logic with mathematical notation, {{it would be}} possible to create a machine that reasons, or artificial intelligence. This was more difficult than expected because of the complexity of human reasoning. In logic programming, a program consists of a set of axioms and rules. Logic programming systems such as Prolog compute the consequences of the axioms and rules in order <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> query.|$|E

Often, {{the rules of}} sudden death provide that in the event a wrong answer is given, the opposing team wins (for instance, the radio quiz show Ask Me Another utilizes this format), even though wrong answers may otherwise not be penalized. Occasionally, the format is a numeric question, with the player making the closer guess winning.|$|E

An army of 12,000 was sent from Bombay to Ethiopia to rescue the captured nationals, {{under the command of}} Sir Robert Napier. The Ethiopians were defeated, and the British stormed the fortress of Magdala (now known as Amba Mariam) on April 13, 1868. When the Emperor heard that the gate had fallen, he fired a pistol into his mouth and killed himself. Sir Robert Napier was raised to the peerage, and given the title of Lord Napier of Magdala.|$|E
25|$|The cue {{familiarity}} {{hypothesis was}} proposed by Reder and Ritter after completing {{a pair of}} experiments which indicated that individuals can evaluate their ability <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> <b>a</b> question before trying to answer it. This finding suggests that the question (cue) and not the actual memory (target) is crucial for making metamemory judgments. Consequently, this hypothesis implies that judgements regarding metamemory are based on an individual’s level of familiarity with the information provided in the cue. Therefore, an individual {{is more likely to}} judge that they know the answer to a question if they are familiar with its topic or terms and more likely to judge that they do not know the answer to a question which presents new or unfamiliar terms.|$|E
