The process involves fewer steps than the Kroll process and takes less <b>time.</b> <b>If</b> mixed oxide powders are used, {{the product is}} an alloy.|$|E

5|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews. Some critics {{praised the}} work of Lee Tamahori, while others criticised the film's heavy use of computer-generated imagery, which they found unconvincing and a distraction from the film's plot. Nevertheless, Die Another Day was the highest-grossing James Bond film up to that <b>time</b> <b>if</b> inflation is not taken into account.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Cross {{features}} a diverse cast of 45 party members. Each character is outfitted with an innate Element affinity and three unique special abilities that are learned over <b>time.</b> <b>If</b> {{taken to the}} world opposite their own, characters react to their counterparts (if available). Many characters tie in to crucial plot events. Since {{it is impossible to}} obtain all 45 characters in one playthrough, players must replay the game to witness everything. Through use of the New Game+ feature, players can ultimately obtain all characters on one save file.|$|E
5|$|Despite his father's {{wishes that}} DeLee become a rabbi, DeLee {{attended}} Chicago Medical College. Of particular influence on DeLee was obstetrics professor W. W. Jaggard. He graduated in 1891. Author Charlotte Borst noted {{that most women}} delivered {{at home in the}} 1870s through 1890s; medical students at Northwestern only witnessed deliveries at that <b>time</b> <b>if</b> they could bribe women into having their babies at the hospital's amphitheatre. DeLee felt fortunate to have observed two such births while he was a student.|$|E
30|$|Within {{the first}} step, {{none of the}} {{variables}} provided statistically significant predictive power. In step 2, {{the likelihood of a}} positive estimate of PTSD increased by more than 33 <b>times</b> <b>if</b> subjects had been trapped/injured under rubble and by more than 17 <b>times</b> <b>if</b> they felt persistent fear of aftershocks (Table  3). Having been trapped/injured under rubble lost its predictive value in the third step, which included the addition of subjects’ previous diagnosis of partial ASD and their personal history of psychopathology (previous contact with MHS). The addition of these variables increased the predictive power of “feeling persistent fear of aftershocks” by almost 25 times, and the likelihood of a positive estimate of PTSD increased by almost 11 <b>times</b> <b>if</b> subjects were diagnosed as a partial ASD {{at the beginning of the}} study.|$|R

5|$|From the {{distance}} of our times, Diefenbaker's role as a prairie populist who tried to revolutionize the Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced {{in the form of}} significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the <b>time.</b> <b>If</b> Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He stood for a fascinating and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values... But his contemporaries were also right in seeing some kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.|$|E
5|$|In April 1963, Galaxy Publishing {{brought out}} {{the first issue of}} Worlds of Tomorrow, another science-fiction {{magazine}}, also edited by Pohl. The magazine published some well-received material and was profitable, but Guinn, the publisher and owner, decided in 1967 {{that it would be better}} to have Galaxy resume a monthly schedule; both Worlds of Tomorrow and Galaxy were bimonthly at that time, while If was monthly. With the August 1967 issue Worlds of Tomorrow was merged with If, though it was another year before Galaxy actually switched to a monthly schedule. By this <b>time,</b> <b>If</b> had become monthly again, starting with the July 1964 issue (though the schedule had an initial hiccup, omitting September 1964).|$|E

Silva's next fight was a catchweight contest against Rich Franklin at UFC 99, in Cologne, Germany on June 13, 2009. Silva lost by unanimous decision in a competitive fight.|$|E

5|$|Most coincidentally, a small {{theropod}} dinosaur named Oviraptor philoceratops {{had been}} discovered while Heilmann was working on his book, and was described by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1924. Figure 8 of Osborn's paper, redrawn from the fossil, shows what was later proven to be an oviraptorid wishbone between the animal's arms. Unfortunately, this important structure was misidentified at the <b>time.</b> <b>If</b> Heilmann had examined this paper as closely as he had much of his source material – or had traveled to New York to see the specimens in person – he may have reversed his conclusions entirely.|$|E
5|$|Preparedness {{refers to}} {{precautions}} {{that should be}} taken before a thunderstorm. Some preparedness {{takes the form of}} general readiness (as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of the day or year). Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save valuable <b>time</b> <b>if</b> a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly. Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.|$|E
5|$|The Challenge Cup is a {{knock-out}} tournament. Within a regionalised format, {{clubs are}} paired at random {{and the first}} club drawn listed as the home team. The winner of each match progresses to the next round and the loser is eliminated from the tournament. Every match, including the final, is a one-legged tie that lasts 90 minutes plus any additional stoppage <b>time.</b> <b>If</b> no clear winner has been determined after 90 minutes of normal time, 30 minutes of extra time is played. If the score is still level after extra time then the winner is decided by a penalty shoot-out.|$|E

According to the category description guide for the 13th Latin Grammy Awards, the award is for video albums consisting {{of more than one}} song or track and is awarded to artists, video directors and/or producers of at least 51% of the total playing <b>time.</b> <b>If</b> the work is a tribute or collection of live performances, the award is presented only to the directors or producers.|$|E
5|$|The algae {{benefit from}} {{a safe place to}} live and consume the polyp's carbon dioxide and {{nitrogenous}} waste. Due to the strain the algae can put on the polyp, stress on the coral often drives them to eject the algae. Mass ejections are known as coral bleaching, because the algae contribute to coral's brown coloration; other colors, however, are due to host coral pigments, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). Ejection increases the polyp's chance of surviving short-term stress—they can regain algae, possibly of a different species at a later <b>time.</b> <b>If</b> the stressful conditions persist, the polyp eventually dies.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including {{limited access to}} education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in that society that occasionally allows for female-specific human rights abuses. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>if</b> talented women footballers do emerge, many choose to go abroad to maximize playing opportunities. A lack of funding impedes regional {{development of}} women's football {{as most of the}} funding for the women's national team comes from FIFA, not the national football association.|$|E

5|$|The {{winner and}} runner-up of each pool enter the {{knockout}} stage. The knockout stage consists of quarter- and semi-finals, {{and then the}} final. The winner of each pool is placed against a runner-up of a different pool in a quarter-final. The winner of each quarter-final goes on to the semi-finals, and the respective winners proceed to the final. Losers of the semi-finals contest for third place, called the 'Bronze Final'. If a match in the knockout stages ends in a draw, the winner is determined through extra <b>time.</b> <b>If</b> that fails, the match goes into sudden death and the next team to score any points is the winner. As a last resort, a kicking competition is used.|$|E
5|$|The {{winner of}} the tournament is decided by a final {{elimination}} match which lasts 90 minutes plus any additional stoppage <b>time.</b> <b>If</b> the score is level and a winner has not been determined after 90 minutes of normal time, 30 minutes of extra time is played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score is still level. Eight finals have gone to extra time, with two being decided in this period of play. The further six have been decided by penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|Women's {{football}} in Africa in general faces many challenges, including {{limited access to}} education, poverty amongst women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>if</b> quality female players in Africa are developed, many leave their home countries to seek greater football opportunities {{in places such as}} Northern Europe or the United States.
