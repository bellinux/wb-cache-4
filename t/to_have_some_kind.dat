Therefore, we need <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>kinds</b> of protective devices to trigger lightning before it could strike naturally. One {{way of doing it}} is by using laser. In this study unfocused UV laser was used to actively discharge the electrodes. Electrodes are used to represent thunderclouds. The separation distance between the electrodes was adjusted to determine the condition for preliminary breakdown. The result showed that, preliminary breakdown occurred at a short ranges separation distance of electrodes, hence very high electric field is required. The breakdown is found stimulated by interfering a UV laser in the thunderclouds. In this respect, the separation distance for breakdown is triple that of without laser. Hence minimum electric field can be achieved for such occurrence of preliminary breakdown...|$|R

You must not expect news for we see no one with whom we are in the least acquainted, or in whose proceedings we have any Interest. You must not expect scandal for by the same rule we are equally debarred either from hearing or inventing it.--You must expect from me nothing but the melancholy effusions of a broken Heart which is ever reverting to the Happiness it once enjoyed and which ill supports its present wretchedness. The Possibility of being able to write, to speak, to you of my lost Henry will be a luxury to me, and your goodness will not I know refuse to read what it will so much releive my Heart to write. I once thought that to have what is in general called a Freind (I mean one of my own sex to whom I might speak with less reserve than to any other person) independant of my sister would never be an object of my wishes, but how much was I mistaken! Charlotte is too much engrossed by two confidential correspondents of that sort, to supply the place of one to me, and I hope you will not think me girlishly romantic, when I say that <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>kind</b> and compassionate Freind who might listen to my sorrows without endeavouring to console me was what I had for some time wished for, when our acquaintance with you, the intimacy which followed it and the particular affectionate attention you paid me almost from the first, caused me to entertain the flattering Idea of those attentions being improved on a closer acquaintance into a Freindship which, if you were what my wishes formed you would be the greatest Happiness I could be capable of enjoying. To find that such Hopes are realised is a satisfaction indeed, a satisfaction which is now almost the only one I can ever experience.--I feel myself so languid that I am sure were you with me you would oblige me to leave off writing, and I cannot give you a greater proof of my affection for you than by acting, as I know you would wish me to do, whether Absent or Present.
