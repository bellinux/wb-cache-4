5|$|Crofting is the {{mainstay}} of island life. Sheep form {{the backbone of the}} agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept, including cattle, pigs, goats, chickens, ducks and geese. Vegetable are grown <b>too,</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> the shelter of circular walls, such plots being known as 'plantie scrubs'. Fishing is still conducted but on a relatively small scale. There is a post office at the pier, but no shop. Mains electricity only came to the island {{at the close of the}} twentieth century. The Papa Stour Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues. Ferries now sail across the Sound of Papa to West Burrafirth on the Shetland Mainland. The crossing takes 45 minutes, and although the Snolda carries cars, there is only one short road on the island. For visiting yachts the four main voes provide good shelter, but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care.|$|E
25|$|Bennis (2004) {{emphasizes}} that corporate leaders must promise their followers {{that they will}} never be devalued or punished because they express dissent. All <b>too</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> the past, organizations would marginalize or terminate any employee who voiced an opposing view. Additionally, leaders should reward dissent and punish conflict avoiders. Anyone who clearly withholds a dissenting view only to obstruct the implementation later should be held responsible.|$|E

60|$|But God's {{infinite}} power <b>too</b> <b>often</b> means, <b>in</b> {{the minds}} of men, only some abstract notion of boundless bodily strength. God's omniscience <b>too</b> <b>often</b> means, only some physical fancy of innumerable telescopic or microscopic eyes. God's infinite wisdom <b>too</b> <b>often</b> means, only some abstract notion of boundless acuteness of brain. And lastly--I am sorry {{to have to say}} it, but it must be said,--God's infinite majesty <b>too</b> <b>often</b> means, <b>in</b> {{the minds of}} some superstitious people, mere pride, and obstinacy, and cruelty, as of the blind will of some enormous animal which does what it chooses, whether right or wrong.|$|R
25|$|When the Comte de Provence {{became the}} actual king of France after the defeat and abdication of Napoleon I in 1814, Blacas was {{appointed}} to the position of minister in charge of the royal household (ministre de la Maison du Roi) in the government of the first Bourbon restoration and given the rank of maréchal de camp (major general). He assumed a dominant role in the new king's Conseil du Roi, essentially acting as prime minister. But, unskilled, he made an assortment of errors, favoring members of the Ancien Régime <b>too</b> <b>often.</b> <b>In</b> addition, his cool and aloof behavior alienated many.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Bader {{joined the}} RAF {{as an officer}} cadet at the Royal Air Force College Cranwell in rural Lincolnshire. He {{continued}} to excel at sports, and added hockey and boxing to his repertoire. Motorcycling was tolerated at Cranwell, though cadets usually took part in banned activities such as speeding, pillion racing and buying and racing motorcars. Bader was involved in these activities and was close to expulsion after being caught out <b>too</b> <b>often,</b> <b>in</b> addition to coming in 19th out of 21 in his class examinations; however, his commanding officer (CO), Air Vice-Marshal Frederick Halahan gave him a private warning about his conduct.|$|E
500|$|In December 2006, Mills {{told the}} BBC {{that she had}} {{received}} death threats, and on 17 December 2006, police stated that a [...] "non-specific threat" [...] {{had been made to}} her safety. This led to more criticism that she was calling out the emergency services <b>too</b> <b>often.</b> <b>In</b> March 2007, Kevin Moore, Chief Superintendent of Sussex Police, said that Mills was running [...] "the risk of being treated as the little boy who cried wolf", and added, [...] "We do have to respond to a disproportionate high volume of calls from Heather Mills McCartney because of the situations she finds herself in, and this is regrettable as it takes officers away from other policing matters". Mills responded that the police had told her to contact them whenever she was being harassed.|$|E

500|$|In late 2000, Kuntz {{decided not}} {{to return to his}} role as first-base coach and outfield instructor. Instead, {{he went back to his}} {{position}} as a roving instructor with the team, which allowed for more time to be spent with his family. At that time, Marlins players including Cliff Floyd and Mark Kotsay praised Kuntz for the amount of preparation that he put into his coaching. Kotsay gave Kuntz credit for the stolen bases he had accrued. Floyd said, [...] ""I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm telling you, he's meant everything. He tells me about every pitcher we're facing. He keeps me going when I'm down. You don't get that <b>too</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> this game. You're expected just to be strong, handle everything. But it ain't that easy sometimes. He's a players' man. He loves us." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 6, 2001 Pope John Paul II, {{the first}} pope to pray in a mosque, {{delivered}} an address at Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, saying: [...] "It {{is important that}} Muslims and Christians continue to explore philosophical and theological questions together, in order {{to come to a}} more objective and comprehensive knowledge of each other's religious beliefs. Better mutual understanding will surely lead, at the practical level, to a new way of presenting our two religions not in opposition, as has happened <b>too</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> the past, but in partnership {{for the good of the}} human family."

2500|$|Many {{pilots who}} flew the Whirlwind praised its performance. Sergeant G. L. Buckwell of 263 Squadron, {{who was shot}} down in a Whirlwind over Cherbourg, later commented that the Whirlwind was [...] "great to fly – we were a privileged few... In retrospect {{the lesson of the}} Whirlwind is clear... A radical {{aircraft}} requires either prolonged development or widespread service to exploit its concept and eliminate its weaknesses. <b>Too</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> World War II, such aircraft suffered accelerated development or limited service, with the result that teething difficulties came to be regarded as permanent limitations". Bruce Robertson, in The Westland Whirlwind Described, quotes a 263 Squadron pilot as saying, [...] "It was regarded with absolute confidence and affection".|$|E

2500|$|In 2012 the Council {{was fined}} £90,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) after it sent {{confidential}} and sensitive information about twenty-two people, including criminal allegations {{and information about}} their mental health, to the wrong recipient. Commenting on Devon and other authorities who had made similar data protection breaches, the ICO said [...] "It would be far too easy to consider these breaches as simple human error. The reality {{is that they are}} caused by councils treating sensitive personal data in the same routine way they would deal with more general correspondence. Far <b>too</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> these cases, the councils do not appear to have acknowledged that the data they are handling is about real people, and often the more vulnerable members of society." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bjelke-Petersen died in St Aubyn's Hospital in Kingaroy in April 2005, aged 94, {{with his}} wife and family members by his side. He {{received}} a State Funeral, held in Kingaroy Town Hall, at which the then Prime Minister, John Howard, and Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie were speakers. Beattie, who had been sued by Bjelke-Petersen for defamation and was arrested during the 1971 Springbok tour protests, said: [...] "I think <b>too</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> the adversarial nature of politics we forget that behind every leader, behind every politician, is indeed a family and we shouldn't forget that." [...] As the funeral was taking place in Kingaroy, about 200 protesters gathered in Brisbane to [...] "ensure that those who suffered under successive Bjelke-Petersen governments were not forgotten". Protest organiser Drew Hutton said [...] "Queenslanders should remember what is described as a dark passage in the state's history." [...] Bjelke-Petersen was buried [...] "beside his trees that he planted and he nurtured and they grew" [...] at the family property [...] "Bethany" [...] at Kingaroy.|$|E
2500|$|Leafa has {{received}} generally positive critical reception. Karen Mead of Japanator.com critiqued Suguha's character as [...] "a fairly nuanced, sympathetic portrayal of someone {{falling in love}} with a blood relation due to an unfortunate set of circumstances, which is entirely different from the 'I love you, Oni-chan!', fetishism that we see all <b>too</b> <b>often</b> <b>in</b> anime [...] We get to know Suguha entirely too well for that", thus debunking criticism of [...] "Suguha falling for Kirito [...] toxic, awful siscon crap". Noting that the focus shifts away from Asuna towards Leafa in the Fairy Dance arc, Anime News Network's Theron Martin wrote in a review that [...] "Suguha's unrequited love seems more like a play meant to pander to 'Big Brother Complex' fans, though she does get some nice emotional development out of it and some very good scenes later on when the matter of her attempt to replace her misplaced love for Kazuto with Leafa's attraction to Kirito (who is also unknowingly her brother) blows up". Reviewing the spin-off manga Sword Art Online: Girls Ops, Martin praised it for Leafa's prominence in the storyline, and [...] "while Suguha was a veritable co-lead for one story arc, she has now been relegated to that role in the franchise, too".|$|E
