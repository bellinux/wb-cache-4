5|$|As House Speaker, Gingrich oversaw passage by the House {{of welfare}} reform and a capital gains <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> 1997. The poor showing by Republicans in the 1998 Congressional elections, a {{reprimand}} from the House for Gingrich's ethics violation, and pressure from Republican colleagues, resulted in Gingrich's resignation from the speakership on November 6, 1998. He resigned altogether from the House on January 3, 1999.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, President Clinton {{signed into}} effect the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which {{included}} the largest capital gains <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> U.S. history. Under the act, the profits {{on the sale of}} a personal residence ($500,000 for married couples, $250,000 for singles) were exempted if lived in for at least 2 years over the last 5. (This had previously been limited to a $125,000 once-in-a-lifetime exemption for those over the age of 55.) There were also reductions {{in a number of other}} taxes on investment gains.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Keating {{became the}} first {{governor}} in 50 years to achieve a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> the state’s income tax. This combined with reduction in the sales tax, estate tax, and unemployment tax formed the largest tax break in the state’s history until that point.|$|E
25|$|While McCain has {{historically}} opposed <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> favor of deficit reduction, he now favors <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> He {{says that he}} would reduce government spending {{to make up for}} the <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b>|$|R

25|$|In August of 1981, after {{negotiations}} with the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-controlled House, Reagan signed the largest marginal <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> American history into law at his California ranch. However, the 1981 marginal cuts were partially offset by bracket creep and increased Social Security rates the following year.|$|E
25|$|Promotions {{and other}} {{advertising}} proved ineffectual at slowing the financial decline. In 1954, H fell into bankruptcy. Although {{it continued to}} operate, the H remained under bankruptcy court protection for years and received a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> 1956. In 1960, creditors approved a tax plan to reorganize the company.|$|E
25|$|His opponents contest job {{prediction}} claims, primarily {{noting that}} the increase in job creation predicted by Bush's plan failed to materialize. They instead allege {{that the purpose of the}} tax cuts was intended to favor the wealthy and special interests, as the majority of benefit from the <b>tax</b> <b>cut,</b> <b>in</b> absolute terms, went to earners in the higher tax brackets. Bush's opponents additionally claim that the tax cuts are a major reason Bush reversed a national surplus into a historically large deficit.|$|E

Automatic contributions to the New Zealand Super Fund were suspended. $2 billion of planned spending by the previous Government's was reprioritised.|$|R
25|$|As {{a private}} citizen, Jindal voted in 2002 for the Louisiana {{constitutional}} amendment {{known as the}} Stelly Plan which lowered some sales taxes in exchange for higher income taxes. Since taking office, Jindal has cut taxes {{a total of six}} times, including the largest income <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> Louisiana's history – a cut of $1.1 billion over five years, along with accelerating the elimination of the tax on business investments. In January 2013, Jindal stated he wants to eliminate all Louisiana corporate and personal income taxes, without giving details for his proposal.|$|E
25|$|The Revenue Act {{was passed}} in {{conjunction}} with the Indemnity Act of 1767, which was intended to make the tea of the British East India Company more competitive with smuggled Dutch tea. The Indemnity Act repealed taxes on tea imported to England, allowing it to be re-exported more cheaply to the colonies. This <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> England would be partially offset by the new Revenue Act taxes on tea in the colonies. The Revenue Act also reaffirmed the legality of writs of assistance, or general search warrants, which gave customs officials broad powers to search houses and businesses for smuggled goods.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{established}} himself as a conservative on virtually all economic issues. He was the first Democrat in the Senate to publicly declare his support for the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, a broad-based tax cut which was criticized by opponents for favoring the rich and being fiscally irresponsible. Miller was the only Democrat to vote against an amendment to that same bill submitted by Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) to scale back portions of that <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> order to spend more on education and debt reduction. He strongly opposed the estate tax and voted a number of times for its repeal. He also advocated drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E

50|$|The term {{fiscal cliff}} {{has been used}} in the past to refer to various fiscal issues. The term started being used {{in the context of the}} {{expiration}} of the Bush <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> 2010. In 2011, the term started to be used to refer to the point at which <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> would expire, and spending cuts would be triggered, that would have occurred in 2013 under a fiscal-cliff scenario.|$|R

500|$|Kemp had a {{reputation}} as the highest-profile progressive Republican. When Dole declined an invitation to speak to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, he suggested Kemp as a substitute even before Kemp had become the Vice Presidential nominee. On August 5, 1996, Dole announced a 15% across-the-board <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> response to both the Forbes campaign and Kemp's tax reform commission. Several of Dole's other campaign ideas came from Kemp and Bill Bennett's Empower America, which had Jeane Kirkpatrick, Weber, Forbes and Alexander as principals. For example, Dole borrowed Kirkpatrick's tough foreign policy, Bennett's [...] "right conduct" [...] and even Alexander's school choice interest.|$|E
500|$|The tax cut {{extension}} for {{the remainder}} of the year was passed as the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 on February 17, 2012, by a vote of 293–132 in the House and 60–36 in the Senate. [...] The bill also contained a further extension of unemployment benefits and the Medicare reimbursement rates. [...] The cost of the tax cut was not offset by spending cuts, but the other provisions were offset by cuts in federal healthcare and pension programs. [...] Republican support for the bill was motivated by a desire to not oppose a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> an election year. [...] Some Democrats criticized the bill for directing spending cuts at federal employees rather than generating funds by increasing taxes on the wealthy or closing tax loopholes.|$|E
2500|$|The Liberals slogan, [...] "go for growth" [...] was {{launched}} after announcing the largest <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> Australian history. Media and political commentators questioned {{the suitability of}} the slogan {{in the context of}} rising inflation and interest rates.|$|E
50|$|Crowding {{out is the}} {{displacement}} of private sector investment by way of higher interest rates, when the government expands its borrowing to finance increased expenditure or <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> excess of revenue.

Brownback {{described}} the tax cuts as a live experiment, stating that [...] " [...] taxes, you need to get your overall rates down, and you need to get your social manipulation out of it, in my estimation, to create growth. We'll see how it works. We'll have a real live experiment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nelson {{was one of}} five Democratic Senators {{who voted}} for the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. The measure called for $1.35 {{trillion}} in tax cuts over 11 years, and for nearly $2 trillion in spending for the following fiscal year. [...] The spending was close to that proposed by Republican President George W. Bush; the tax cuts were slightly less than the $1.6 trillion sought by Bush. [...] He was also the deciding vote for passage of the 2003 tax cut which accelerated many of the provisions in the 2001 <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> addition to benefits for small businesses.|$|E
2500|$|This article {{discusses}} the domestic {{policy of the}} Ronald Reagan administration from 1981 to 1989. Reagan's policies stressed conservative economic values, starting with his implementation of supply-side economic policies, dubbed as [...] "Reaganomics" [...] by both supporters and detractors. His policies also included the largest <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> American history as well as increased defense spending {{as part of his}} Soviet strategy. However, he significantly raised taxes four times due to economic conditions and reforms, but the tax reforms instituted during presidency brought top marginal rates to their lowest levels since 1931, such that by 1988, the top US marginal tax rate was 28%.|$|E

2500|$|McCain had {{declined}} to sign the pledge of the group Americans for Tax Reform to not add any new taxes or increase existing taxes. However, after he lost the presidential election in 2008, McCain became a signer of Americans for Tax Reform's Taxpayer Protection Pledge. In 2002, Sen. McCain {{was one of only}} two Republicans to twice vote against the permanent repeal of the Estate Tax, and has recently stated opposition to a permanent repeal of the Estate Tax. McCain was one of two Republicans who voted against Bush's <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> 2001. He opposed accelerating the <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> 2003, saying that he was not in favor of cutting taxes during a time of war. In 2004 McCain appeared on Meet The Press with Tim Russert where he was asked about his opposition to the Bush <b>tax</b> <b>cuts.</b> McCain explained himself by saying, [...] "I voted against the <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> because of the disproportional amount that went to the wealthiest Americans. I would clearly support not extending those <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> order to help address the deficit." [...] However, McCain supported the Bush <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> extension <b>in</b> May 2006, and January 2008 he told Russert that he favors making those <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> permanent to prevent an increase in taxes while the economy was [...] "shaky." [...] He also said that his tax proposal would focus more on middle-income Americans than on the wealthy.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2012, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback {{signed into}} law the Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117, {{one of the largest}} income <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> Kansas' history.

2500|$|Reagan lifted {{remaining}} domestic petroleum {{price and}} allocation controls on January 28, 1981, {{and lowered the}} oil windfall profits tax in August 1981. He ended the oil windfall profits tax in 1988. In 1982, Reagan agreed to a rollback of corporate tax cuts and a smaller rollback of individual income tax cuts. The 1982, tax increase undid {{a third of the}} initial <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> <b>In</b> 1983, Reagan instituted a payroll tax increase on Social Security and Medicare hospital insurance. In 1984, another bill was introduced that closed tax loopholes. According to tax historian Joseph Thorndike, the bills of 1982 and 1984 [...] "constituted the biggest tax increase ever enacted during peacetime".|$|E
2500|$|The Cato Institute, {{a libertarian}} {{non-profit}} public policy research foundation, gave Huckabee an [...] "F" [...] for spending and tax policy in 2006. [...] Huckabee has asserted {{he did not}} raise spending significantly in areas he could control and in those areas spending rose six-tenths of one percent a year during his entire governance. [...] He also signed the first broad-based <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> Arkansas's history. For 2006, he says that his state enjoyed a surplus of nearly $850 million. In January 2008, Huckabee repeated this assertion, while also pointing out that {{at the beginning of}} his term Arkansas had a $200 million deficit. [...] However, during his tenure, the state's general obligation debt increased by almost $1 billion.|$|E
2500|$|Rubio {{introduced}} {{a plan to}} reduce state property taxes to 2001 levels (and potentially eliminate them altogether), while increasing sales taxes by 1% to 2.5% to fund schools. [...] The proposal would have reduced property taxes in the state by $40–50 billion. His proposal passed the House, but was opposed by Governor Crist and Florida Senate Republicans, {{who said that the}} increase in sales tax would disproportionately affect the poor. So, Rubio agreed to smaller changes, and Crist's proposal to double the state's property tax exemption from $25,000 to $50,000 (for a tax reduction estimated by Crist to be $33 billion) ultimately passed. Legislators called it the largest <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> Florida's history up until then. At the time, Republican anti-tax activist Grover Norquist described Rubio as [...] "the most pro-taxpayer legislative leader in the country." ...|$|E
