5|$|A story {{tells of}} a ninth-century Rajput king, Nahar Rao Parihar of Mandore, chasing a white boar to <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> shore on a hunting expedition. In order to quench his thirst, he dipped his hand into <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> and was {{astonished}} {{to see that the}} Leukoderma marks on his hand had disappeared. Impressed with the sacred curative nature of <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> he got <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> restored to its glory. After discovering the curative characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> water, people have since visited <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> to take a holy dip and cure themselves of skin problems.|$|E
5|$|Development {{plans are}} under {{various stages of}} {{implementation}} to address the critical issues related to <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> They aim to improve water quality, increase water storage capacity, prevent encroachment of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> periphery, improve the ambience around <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> {{as well as to}} introduce recreational and revenue generating schemes.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Royal Park {{embarked}} on {{the restoration of}} the Serpentine to combat growing concerns about the status of the water {{and the quality of the}} aquatic environment. The project resulted in a substantial change to the hydrology of <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> which had a turnover time of 10 years, and is now reduced to 4–5 months as a result of new borehole water being pumped into <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> The three boreholes, drilled into the Upper Chalk, now supply <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> with up to 900,000 cubic metres of water per annum ensuring that <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> remains fresh and does not stagnate. In addition, the historically contaminated sediments have been treated and nutrients within the sediments chemically neutralised. Thirdly, the oxygen status of the water and the overall mixing of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> is now controlled by a series of 24 aeration pumps fixed to the base of <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> These ensure that the dissolved oxygen levels in <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> do not fall and result in chronic ecological stress. Finally, the overall ecology of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> was reviewed and some of the large bream and carp were removed in February 2012 to reduce their disturbance of the sediment and vegetation of <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> These measures were implemented over the period October 2011 to June 2012. The resultant water quality of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> was excellent and proved to be an extremely popular venue for the swimming portion of the London 2012 Triathlon and the Marathon Swim events in August 2012.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lakes</b> are not fed by streams, and the {{evaporation}} rate of <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> in <b>the</b> hot desert climate exceeds {{the rate at}} which rainwater refills them. <b>The</b> <b>lakes</b> are fed by underground water percolating through the rocks and into <b>the</b> <b>lakes.</b> <b>The</b> high {{evaporation rate}} produces brackish water in <b>the</b> <b>lakes.</b>|$|R

25|$|Prior {{to human}} development, Flushing Meadows was {{originally}} a tidal marsh, with Flushing Creek receiving south-flowing waters from the tides of Flushing Bay. Although <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> were built as freshwater lakes and dammed to mitigate tidal effects, flooding continues to effect <b>the</b> park. <b>The</b> <b>lakes</b> are also highly eutrophic, due to nutrients such as phosphorus {{from the former}} marshland seeping into the water, leading {{to the death of}} fish in <b>the</b> <b>lakes.</b> <b>The</b> regular tidal action that would filter <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> is prevented by the dam. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> are subject to pollution and storm runoff from the nearby highways, via pipes which feed into <b>the</b> <b>lakes.</b>|$|R
5|$|Owing to the {{proliferation}} of beaches, boat ramps and jetties, the West Lake is the area most used by swimmers and vessels. A bike path also surrounds <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> and riding, walking or jogging around <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> are a popular activity on the weekends. Fireworks are often held over <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> on New Year's Eve, and a large show called Skyfire has been held at <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> since 1989.|$|E
5|$|Sewage outfalls into <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> are {{proposed}} {{to be completely}} stopped by the interception and diversion of feeder lines. Lining the main feeders into <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> and setting up water treatment plants to continuously treat and recirculate <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> water are also envisioned. Conservation measures proposed for adoption to clean <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> are by way of desilting and deweeding, water treatment at inlet of feeders into <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> construction of check dams, conservation of ghats, afforestation of denuded hills in the catchment, soil moisture conservation measures, stabilization of sand dunes by planting vegetation of suitable species of plants and restriction of cultivation {{in the bed of}} feeder channels. In addition, the institutional measures considered for effecting improvement of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> are mass awareness programmes with the population's participation as well as the control of fish proliferation {{to reduce the risk of}} death of fishes during periods of inadequate water depth in <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> effect snowfalls {{are more}} likely to occur in late fall, early winter, and during spring due to the higher {{temperature}} differences between <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> and the air above it. During summer, the temperature differences can cause thunderstorms to form over <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> and drift eastward along the northern Wasatch Front. Some rainstorms may also be partially attributed to <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> effect in fall and spring. It is estimated that approximately six to eight lake effect snowstorms occur in a year, and that 10% of the average precipitation of Salt Lake City can be attributed to <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> effect.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lakes</b> of Killarney are Lough Leane (<b>the</b> lower <b>lake),</b> Muckross <b>Lake</b> (<b>the</b> middle <b>lake),</b> and <b>the</b> Upper <b>Lake.</b> These lakes are {{interlinked}} {{and together}} make up {{almost a quarter}} of the park's area. Despite being interlinked, each lake has a unique ecosystem. <b>The</b> <b>lakes</b> join at <b>the</b> Meeting of the Waters, a popular tourist area. Sport angling on <b>the</b> <b>lakes</b> has been a popular pastime for generations, utilising the lakes' large populations of brown trout and salmon.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Lower <b>Lake</b> {{is located}} {{to the east}} of <b>the</b> Upper <b>Lake.</b> An earthen dam {{separates}} <b>the</b> two <b>lakes.</b> <b>The</b> two <b>lakes</b> are built in a terraced manner, the lowest level of <b>the</b> Upper <b>Lake</b> is just below the highest level of <b>the</b> Lower <b>Lake.</b>|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> has {{a maximum}} depth of 17feet (5.3m). <b>The</b> <b>lake</b> is often {{reported}} to be deeper, but bathymetric surveys by the Royal Park in 2010 revealed the design of <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> {{is located}} in the south east part of the park. Fishing is {{permitted}} in <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> which is stocked with large mouth bass, crappie, bream, and catfish. A 2002 renovation of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> added a new bridge connecting the two bodies of water and three fishing piers located around <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lake</b> {{is popular}} as a visitor {{attraction}} and a summer resort. Fisheries and the harvesting {{of food and}} fodder plants are also important on Dal. Weeds from <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> are extracted and converted into compost for the gardens. It {{also serves as a}} flood lung of the Jhelum River. Swimming, boating, snow skiing (particularly when <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> is frozen during the severe winter), and canoeing are amongst some of the water sports activities practised on <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The park {{consist of}} three {{connecting}} lakes covering over a total area of 48 hectares. The lakes' eastern shores consist of several small hills, {{and they were}} formed with the earth dredged from <b>the</b> <b>lakes,</b> to balance <b>the</b> natural hills on the western shores of <b>the</b> <b>lakes.</b> There are five bridges connecting <b>the</b> <b>lakes,</b> islands and hills into a single integrated area.

50|$|Alpine <b>lakes</b> include <b>the</b> <b>Lakes</b> of Cristalliera, where {{herds of}} mouflon come to graze, <b>Lake</b> Chardonnet, <b>the</b> <b>Lakes</b> of Beth, which afford {{views of the}} old {{abandoned}} copper mines, and <b>the</b> <b>Lakes</b> of Albergian, where edelweiss and Alpine aster blossom in summer.|$|R
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> by water hyacinth, has substantially impeded water circulation and caused {{an increase in}} siltation and deposit of pollutants in <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> water, but an increase in the shallow part of <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|E

5|$|Various {{types of}} {{cyanobacteria}} inhabit Lake Chillisquaque. The specific genera that inhabit <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> vary {{at different times}} of the year and also at different depths within <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> Due to the presence of light attenuation in <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> light plays a role in determining which species of cyanobacteria inhabit it.|$|E

5|$|A diatom floristic {{study of}} the lagoon {{revealed}} that it contains 41 species and is a rich storehouse of psychrophilic photosynthetic bacteria. The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and the ecology of photosynthetic bacteria of <b>the</b> <b>Lake</b> Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E
5|$|A hunter named Robinson, whose {{cabin was}} at the lake's {{northern}} end about 1800, was the first recorded inhabitant. He gave <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> its earliest known name: Robinson's Lake. However, {{for most of the}} 19th century <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> was known as Long Pond, because of its elongated shape. From 1822 to 1827 the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which followed the lake's western shore, was built between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. Beginning in 1827 the northbound daily stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> about noon. The stage operated until 1851; the road was the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike until 1908, when the modern Pennsylvania Route 487 was built. Route 487 follows the course of the turnpike as it approaches <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> from the south, then passes to the east of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> instead.|$|E
5|$|A lake {{restoration}} plan {{based on a}} decentralised bioreactor system to eliminate the organic load that enters <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> {{in the form of}} non-point and point source pollutants has also been mooted. Phumdis could be harvested in a sustainable manner by conversion into fuel and compost by installing ‘Plug Flow Bioreactors’ in a modular manner around <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> perimeter. Laboratory tests of key species of phumdis have proved its potential to produce biogas. The bioreactors could also be used to treat sewage and thus arrest flow of organic matter into <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lakes</b> of Killarney contain many {{brown trout}} {{and an annual}} run of salmon.

50|$|Due to the {{overuse of}} <b>the</b> <b>lake's</b> water for {{agricultural}} purposes in recent years, Doiran's water nearly drained out, but the disaster was avoided after the countries took measures to replenish and sustain <b>the</b> <b>lake's</b> water levels. Frequent and heavy rainfalls, in last years, also helped restoring <b>the</b> <b>lake's</b> water levels.|$|R
5|$|After the American Civil War, {{returning}} residents {{found that}} their slaves, livestock and farm equipment had been taken. Most residents relocated. However, in the early 20th century, farmers returned {{and the town of}} Green Lake modestly grew to an approximate population of 300 in 1914. At the time, much of the land in the vicinity was used for livestock grazing. The only profitable commercial uses for <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> itself included transportation of lumber and fishing. Approximately US$100,000 worth of fish were caught in <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> from 1900 to 1915. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> bed remained dry for extended periods and vegetation covered certain areas. Local residents soon began to use the bed to grow cotton.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic midges (Chironomidae) {{provide the}} highest {{proportion}} of the fly life of <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> The trout (Salmonidae) will feed at the surface on these and water boatmen (Corixidae), and below the surface on the caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae and pupae; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge. Other aquatic fauna including daphnia and snails are also found in <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> Large populations of dragonflies, including migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) and significant numbers of ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum), occur at <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> Eleven species of wainscot moth make their home in the reed beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot (Archanara dissoluta), twin-spotted wainscot (Archanara geminipuncta) and silky wainscot (Chilodes maritimus).|$|E
5|$|As deduced {{from the}} {{presence}} of freshwater molluscs, Lake Cahuilla was a freshwater lake during its highstand, while lower lake level stages show fossil evidence of increased salinity.
