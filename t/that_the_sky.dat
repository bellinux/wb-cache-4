5|$|Nigel Kneale {{had been}} unhappy with Hammer's {{adaptation}} of The Quatermass Experiment, {{partly because he}} received no extra remuneration {{from the sale of}} the film rights and partly because of the changes made in the film to his original television script. In the wake of his dissatisfaction, Kneale exerted pressure on the BBC to allow him to be more involved in the sale of the rights to his work. Despite being in the final months of his BBC contract, Kneale was allowed to collaborate with Hammer on the adaptation of Quatermass II. The first draft of the screenplay was written by Kneale with input from producer Anthony Hinds. Subsequent drafts were worked on by director Val Guest, as he had done before on The Quatermass Xperiment. Guest recalled of Kneale's script that there was “lots of philosophising and very down-to-earth thinking but it was too long, it would not have held screenwise. So, again, I had to tailor it and sharpen it and hopefully not ruin it”. The script was submitted to the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC) in April 1956. BBFC reader Audrey Field commented, “There should be the customary general caution <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> is not the limit, either in sights or sounds”. The BBFC's main objection was to a scene in which a guard from the Winnerden Flats complex murders a family having a picnic. This scene was omitted from the final film, although it is present in the original television presentation.|$|E

25|$|After winning {{everything}} on the club level, Alvertis was still thirsty for titles nonetheless. In the 2001–02 season he led the Panathinaikos offense along with the great Dejan Bodiroga, Damir Mulaomerović and İbrahim Kutluay, averaging 10.2 points per game; in the EuroLeague Final against Kinder Bologna, he scored 11 points, showing great leadership throughout the game. By lifting his third EuroLeague title, Alvertis proved <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> was the limit concerning the number of his titles.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} failed {{operations}} after that point, particularly the Battle of the Barents Sea—combined with the outstanding {{success of the}} U-boat fleet {{under the command of}} Karl Dönitz—led to his eventual demotion to the rank of Admiral Inspector of the Kriegsmarine in January 1943. The office of Admiral Inspector was only a ceremonial position with no power. After the Battle of the Barents Sea on 31 December 1942, Raeder, who had received confusing, misleading and incomplete reports from Admiral Oskar Kummetz, had at first reported to Hitler a great victory had been won above the Arctic Circle. Kummetz mentioned in his report <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> was red – a reference to the Aurora Borealis – and Raeder misunderstood this as meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> was red because the British ships were all on fire. Later on the evening of 31 December 1942, Raeder called Admiral Theodor Krancke at the Wolf's Lair to explain the misunderstanding, but there was a New Year's party going on, and Krancke decided not to ruin the party by reporting the misunderstanding. Hitler during his New Year's Address delivered on the radio later that night mentioned the victory that the Kriegsmarine had won {{on the last day of}} 1942 with an entire British convoy said to had been destroyed.|$|E
25|$|While some Old Norse kennings are {{relatively}} transparent, many {{depend on a}} knowledge of specific myths or legends. Thus the sky might be called naturalistically él-ker “squall-vat” (Markús Skeggjason: Eiríksdrápa 3) or described in mythical terms as Ymis haus “Ymir’s skull” (Arnórr jarlaskáld: Magnúsdrápa 19), referring to the idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> was made out of the skull of the primeval giant Ymir. Still others name mythical entities according to certain conventions without reference to a specific story: rimmu Yggr “Odin of battle” = “warrior” (Arnórr jarlaskáld: Magnúsdrápa 5).|$|E

In the end Volador Jr. pinned long running rival Último Guerrero to retain their championship.|$|E
25|$|The Stainforth Trophy was {{designed}} by Robin Beresford. The trophy depicts in silver three supersonic aircraft and spiralling vapour trails soaring into the stratosphere. The artist also tried to display {{an awareness of the}} achievements of the Schneider Trophy Team in the design, being aware that these achievements resulted in the improved design and development, by R. J. Mitchell, of the Spitfire, which played such a major role in Britain's victory in World War II. In the design of the trophy, the artist has tried to show the Earth as seen by the astronauts, vapour trails ending in arrows to depict high speed altitude flight, and with an outward sweep to infinity, which suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> is literally the limit of man's achievement in the air. Into his design, he has incorporated a star and its orbit to evoke the achievements of science and the Royal Air Force motto Per ardua ad astra.|$|E
25|$|The famous astronomers Nicholas Copernicus, {{who put the}} sun at {{the centre}} of the heavens in 1543, and Galileo Galilei, who experimented with the new {{technology}} of the telescope and, with its aid declared his belief that Copernicus was correct – were both practising Catholics – indeed Copernicus was a catholic clergyman. Yet the church establishment at that time held to theories devised in pre-Christian Greece by Ptolemy and Aristotle, which said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> revolved around the earth. When Galileo began to assert that the earth in fact revolved around the sun, he therefore found himself challenging the Church establishment at a time where the Church hierarchy also held temporal power and was engaged in the ongoing political challenge of the rise of Protestantism. After discussions with Pope Urban VIII (a man who had written admiringly of Galileo before taking papal office), Galileo believed he could avoid censure by presenting his arguments in dialogue form – but the Pope took offence when he discovered that some of his own words were being spoken by a character in the book who was a simpleton and Galileo was called for a trial before the Inquisition.|$|E

500|$|The series {{features}} [...] "sky flowers" [...] {{as a main}} setting material. They {{first appeared}} in the pilot and have since become a common feature throughout the series. When series background designer Kenny Pittenger was asked what they were, he answered, [...] "They function as clouds in a way, but since the show takes place underwater, they aren't really clouds. Because of the tiki influence on the show, the background painters use a lot of pattern." [...] Pittenger said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> flowers were meant to [...] "evoke the look of a flower-print Hawaiian shirt".|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} to see {{the degree to which}} the technique allowed Bouts, in the words of art historian Susan Jones, to [...] " [...] sophistication... to create both fine linear detail and subtle tonal transitions."

2500|$|Most {{histories}} of the crisis conclude that Faubus, facing pressure as he campaigned for a third term, decided to appease racist elements in the state by calling out the National Guard to prevent the black students from entering Central High. Former associate justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court James D. Johnson claimed to have hoaxed Governor Faubus into calling out the National Guard, supposedly to prevent a white mob from stopping the integration of Little Rock Central High School: [...] "There wasn't any caravan. But we made Orval believe it. We said. 'They're lining up. They're coming in droves.' ... The only weapon we had was to leave the impression <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> was going to fall." [...] He later claimed that Faubus asked him to raise a mob to justify his actions.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Mental Events" [...] (1970) Davidson {{advanced}} {{a form of}} token identity {{theory about}} the mind: token mental events are identical to token physical events. One previous difficulty with such a view was {{that it did not}} seem feasible to provide laws relating mental states, like believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> is blue or wanting a hamburger, to physical states, such as patterns of neural activity in the brain. [...] Davidson argued that such a reduction would not be necessary to a token identity thesis: it is possible that each individual mental event just is the corresponding physical event, without there being laws relating types (as opposed to tokens) of mental events to types of physical events. Davidson argued that the fact that no such a reduction could be had does not entail that the mind is anything more than the brain. Hence, Davidson called his position anomalous monism: monism, because it claims that only one thing is at issue in questions of mental and physical events; anomalous (from a-, [...] "not," [...] and omalos, [...] "regular") because mental and physical event types could not be connected by strict laws (laws without exceptions).|$|E
