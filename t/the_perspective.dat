40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine interreligious {{participation}} for male Muslim musicians in Hindu religious context. Data for this study is collected by qualitative interviews on the previously mentioned Muslims. These interviews where performed in India, Varanasi. The collected data is analyzed through four perspectives on interreligious participation. The results show how the participation can be understood. It also shows through which of <b>the</b> four <b>perspectives,</b> which this papers theory rests on, can be used to understand how the musicians explain their participation. <b>The</b> four <b>perspectives</b> are; <b>the</b> participation <b>perspective,</b> <b>the</b> cultural <b>perspective,</b> <b>the</b> practitioner’s <b>perspective</b> and <b>the</b> no <b>perspective,</b> that enlightens <b>the</b> understanding of this particular interreligious participation. The result shows that a combination of <b>the</b> four <b>perspectives</b> is used to best understand the answers for the study questions. By discussing three major themes that correlates with the study question it became apparent that a combination of <b>the</b> different <b>perspectives</b> was <b>the</b> way to understand it. The first theme; music or faith had a majority of the use of <b>the</b> practitioner’s <b>perspective.</b> <b>The</b> other theme; the contact to God, shows more of a combination where <b>the</b> three first <b>perspectives</b> are dominant. <b>The</b> final theme: Music as a religion, is mostly a combination of <b>the</b> no <b>perspective</b> and <b>the</b> practitioner’s <b>perspective.</b> What can be said from those findings are that all of <b>the</b> <b>perspectives</b> are needed to understand how the musicians claim to experience and feel about their interreligious participation, although some of <b>the</b> <b>perspectives</b> are more used than others...|$|R
