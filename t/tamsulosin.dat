25|$|Selective α1-blockers are {{the most}} common choice for initial therapy. They include alfuzosin, doxazosin, silodosin, <b>tamsulosin,</b> and terazosin. They have a small to {{moderate}} benefit. All five are equally effective but have slightly different side effect profiles.-Adrenoceptor Antagonists in Patients with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Suggestive of Benign Prostatic Obstruction |journal=European Urology |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |year=1999 |pmid=10364649 |doi=10.1159/000019919}} Alpha blockers relax smooth muscle in the prostate and the bladder neck, thus decreasing the blockage of urine flow. Common side effects of alpha blockers include orthostatic hypotension (a head rush or dizzy spell when standing up or stretching), ejaculation changes, erectile dysfunction, headaches, nasal congestion, and weakness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tamsulosin</b> and {{silodosin}} are selective α1 receptor blockers that preferentially bind to the α1A receptor in {{the prostate}} {{instead of the}} α1B receptor in the blood vessels. Less-selective α1 receptor blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin may lower blood pressure. The older, less selective α1-adrenergic blocker prazosin is not a first line choice for either high blood pressure or prostatic hyperplasia; it is a choice for patients who present with both problems at the same time. The older, broadly non-selective alpha blocker medications such as phenoxybenzamine are not recommended for control of BPH. Non-selective alpha blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin may also require slow dose adjustments as they can lower blood pressure and cause syncope (fainting) if {{the response to the}} medication is too strong.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tamsulosin</b> is {{also used}} as an add on {{treatment}} for acute urinary retention. People may void more successfully after catheter removal if they are taking <b>tamsulosin.</b> People taking <b>tamsulosin</b> are also less likely to need re-catheterization.|$|E
50|$|Selective {{action of}} <b>tamsulosin</b> in alpha 1A/D receptors is {{controversial}} and over {{three quarters of}} <b>tamsulosin</b> registered human studies are unpublished.|$|E
50|$|IFIS {{has been}} {{associated}} with <b>tamsulosin</b> (e.g., Flomax), a medication widely prescribed for urinary symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). <b>Tamsulosin</b> is a selective alpha blocker that works by relaxing the bladder and prostatic smooth muscle. As such, it also relaxes the iris dilator muscle by binding to its postsynaptic nerve endings. Even if a patient has only taken <b>tamsulosin</b> once in their life, that dose is enough to cause IFIS during cataract extraction indefinitely. Various alpha-blockers are associated with IFIS, but <b>tamsulosin</b> has a stronger association than the others.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tamsulosin</b> is {{primarily}} used for {{benign prostatic hyperplasia}} and {{to help with the}} passage of kidney stones. <b>Tamsulosin,</b> however, appears to be effective only for stones over 4 mm and less than 10 mm in size.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tamsulosin</b> {{was first}} marketed in 1996 under the trade name Flomax. It is now marketed by various {{companies}} under licence, including Boehringer-Ingelheim and CSL. <b>Tamsulosin</b> hydrochloride extended-release capsules are marketed under the trade names Urimax 0.4(India), Flomax, Flomaxtra, Contiflo XL, bestflo, Urimax and Pradif, although generic, non-modified-release capsules are still approved and marketed {{in many countries}} (such as Canada). In Mexico, it is marketed as Secotex and as Harnal D in Japan and Indonesia and as Harnal OCAS (oral controlled absorption system) in Thailand. In Egypt, Italy, Russia and Iceland, it is marketed under the trade name Omnic by Astellas Pharma Europe. The largest manufacturer of <b>tamsulosin,</b> drug substance, is Synthon BV (The Netherlands). <b>Tamsulosin</b> hydrochloride is marketed in Bangladesh under the trade names Uromax, Tamisol MR, Tamsin.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{medications}} {{to speed the}} spontaneous passage of stones in the ureter {{is referred to as}} medical expulsive therapy. Several agents, including alpha adrenergic blockers (such as <b>tamsulosin)</b> and calcium channel blockers (such as nifedipine), {{have been found to be}} effective. Alpha blockers appear to lead to both higher and faster stone clearance rates. Alpha blockers; however, only appear to be effective for stones over 4 mm but less than 10 mm in size. A combination of <b>tamsulosin</b> and a corticosteroid may be better than <b>tamsulosin</b> alone. These treatments also appear to be a useful in addition to lithotripsy.|$|E

50|$|The {{combination}} dutasteride/tamsulosin hydrochloride (trade names Jalyn, Combodart, and Duodart) is {{a prescription}} pharmaceutical produced by GlaxoSmithKline {{for the treatment}} of adult male symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).It is a combination of two previously existing drugs: <b>Tamsulosin</b> Hydrochloride, trade name Flomax, and Dutasteride, trade name Avodart. It contains 0.4 mg of <b>Tamsulosin</b> Hydrochloride and 0.5 mg of Dutasteride.|$|E
50|$|The {{severity}} of the condition is not linked to the duration of <b>tamsulosin</b> intake.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tamsulosin</b> is a {{selective}} α1 receptor antagonist that has preferential selectivity for the α1A receptor in the prostate versus the α1B receptor {{in the blood}} vessels.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tamsulosin</b> is {{relatively}} selective for α1a-adrenergic receptors, which are mainly {{present in the}} prostate. Hence, it may have a more selective action in BPH with minimal effects on blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} may cause or worsen the disease. This includes NSAIDS, {{a number of}} anesthetic agents such as ketamine, thiazolidinediones, a number of cancer medications, salbutamol, <b>tamsulosin</b> among others.|$|E
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of alpha blockers (<b>tamsulosin,</b> alfuzosin) is questionable in men with CPPS. A 2006 meta analysis {{found that they}} are moderately beneficial when the duration of therapy was at least 3 months.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tamsulosin</b> was {{developed}} by Yamanouchi Pharmaceuticals (now part of Astellas Pharma) and was first marketed in 1996. The U.S. patent expired in October 2009. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved generics in March 2010.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tamsulosin,</b> {{and other}} {{medications}} {{in the class}} called alpha blockers, work by relaxing bladder neck muscles and muscle fibers in the prostate itself and {{make it easier to}} urinate. It is an α1a adrenergic receptor antagonist.|$|E
5000|$|The {{results of}} the CombAT (combination of {{dutasteride}} and <b>tamsulosin</b> under the brand name Duodart) trial in 2008 demonstrated that treatment with the combination of dutasteride (Avodart) and <b>tamsulosin</b> provides greater symptom benefits compared to monotherapy with either agent alone for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.The CombAT trial became the medication Jalyn. It {{was approved by the}} FDA on 14 June 2010. [...] This combination can be useful as it can take up to six months for any symptomatic relief to be found by 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors such as dutasteride compared to alpha-1 receptor blockers which can provide relief in some cases within 48 hours.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tamsulosin,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Alna ® / Flomax ®, is a {{medication}} {{used to treat}} symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), help {{with the passage of}} kidney stones, and for urinary retention along with other measures.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the causes}} of aspermia is {{retrograde}} ejaculation, which can be brought on by excessive drug use, or as a result of prostate surgery. It can also be caused by alpha blockers such as <b>tamsulosin</b> and silodosin.|$|E
50|$|Retrograde {{ejaculation}} is {{a common}} side effect of medications, such as <b>tamsulosin,</b> {{that are used to}} relax the muscles of the urinary tract, treating conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia. By relaxing the bladder sphincter muscle, the likelihood of retrograde ejaculation is increased.|$|E
5000|$|Ophthalmologic: Patients taking <b>tamsulosin</b> {{are prone}} to a {{complication}} known as floppy iris syndrome during cataract surgery. Adverse outcomes of the surgery are greatly reduced by the surgeon's prior knowledge of the patient's history with this drug, and thus having the option of alternative techniques.|$|E
50|$|As {{discussed}} above, <b>tamsulosin</b> {{may have}} less risk for low {{blood pressure and}} orthostatic hypotension due to its selectivity for α1a-adrenergic receptors. On the other hand, the drug (a) elevates risk for floppy iris syndrome, and (b) might show adverse drug reactions (ADRs) characteristic of the sulfa related drugs.|$|E
50|$|Persistent infections may {{be helped}} in 80% of {{patients}} {{by the use}} of alpha blockers (<b>tamsulosin</b> (Flomax), alfuzosin), or long term low dose antibiotic therapy. Recurrent infections may be caused by inefficient urination (benign prostatic hypertrophy, neurogenic bladder), prostatic stones or a structural abnormality that acts as a reservoir for infection.|$|E
50|$|Some {{people with}} BPH {{are treated with}} medications. These include <b>tamsulosin</b> to relax smooth muscles in the bladder neck, and {{finasteride}} and dutasteride to decrease prostate enlargement. The drugs only work for mild cases of BPH but also have mild side effects. Some of the medications decrease libido and may cause dizziness, fatigue and lightheadedness.|$|E
5000|$|Jalyn was {{the result}} of the CombAT (Combination of Avodart and <b>Tamsulosin)</b> trial of 2008. It was {{approved}} by the FDA on June 14, 2010. [...] In June 2011, the FDA approved a label change warning of [...] "Increased Risk of High-grade Prostate Cancer" [...] from Jalyn.Since it contains two drugs, it has the drug interactions, side effects and warnings of both drugs.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, it has {{recently}} been shown that patients taking <b>tamsulosin</b> (Flomax), a common drug for enlarged prostate, are prone to developing a surgical complication known as intraoperative floppy iris syndrome (IFIS), which must be correctly managed to avoid the complication posterior capsule rupture; however, prospective {{studies have shown that}} the risk is greatly reduced if the surgeon is informed of the patient's history with the drug beforehand, and has appropriate alternative techniques prepared.|$|E
50|$|Selective α1-blockers are {{the most}} common choice for initial therapy. They include alfuzosin, doxazosin, silodosin, <b>tamsulosin,</b> and terazosin. They have a small to {{moderate}} benefit. All five are equally effective but have slightly different side effect profiles. Alpha blockers relax smooth muscle in the prostate and the bladder neck, thus decreasing the blockage of urine flow. Common side effects of alpha blockers include orthostatic hypotension (a head rush or dizzy spell when standing up or stretching), ejaculation changes, erectile dysfunction, headaches, nasal congestion, and weakness.|$|E
50|$|In {{pelvic floor}} muscle {{disorder}} {{the muscles of}} the pelvic floor remain tightened. Normally these muscles are under voluntary control, but for some excessive tension can develop. Reasons for this are not well known but can be resultant from a natural disposition, learned reaction to stress or pain, trauma, or any combination of these. Excessive pelvic floor tension can result in various problems including frequent urination (due to the bladder's inability to expand) or pain. Treatments involve relaxing the muscles, using medication (such as <b>tamsulosin),</b> biofeedback, or physical therapy.|$|E
5000|$|BPH is {{normally}} initially treated medically. This is done through alpha antagonists such as <b>tamsulosin</b> or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride. If medical treatment does not reduce a patient's urinary symptoms, a TURP {{may be considered}} following a careful examination of the prostate/bladder through a cystoscope. If TURP is contraindicated a urologist may consider a simple prostatectomy, in and out catheters, or a supra-pubic catheter to help a patient void urine effectively. [...] As medical management of BPH improves, the numbers of TURPs have been decreasing.|$|E
50|$|Alpha {{blockers}} {{have been}} studied when treating people with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD). Terazosin has shown no reduction in voiding pressures {{with people who have}} suffered from spinal cord injuries, while <b>Tamsulosin</b> was given to patients with MS and resulted in improvement of post void residual measurements. However, it is not advised to use alpha blockers {{due to the lack of}} data supporting their success.Anti-spasmodic medications have also been tested on people with DSD. Baclofen does not have a great effect on people with DSD when taken orally because it is not permeable enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.|$|E
50|$|In {{those who}} have had stones, {{prevention}} is by drinking fluids such that more than two liters of urine are produced per day. If this is not effective enough, thiazide diuretic, citrate, or allopurinol may be taken. It is recommended that soft drinks containing phosphoric acid (typically colas) be avoided. When a stone causes no symptoms, no treatment is needed. Otherwise pain control is usually the first measure, using medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids. Larger stones may be helped to pass with the medication <b>tamsulosin</b> or may require procedures such as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, or percutaneous nephrolithotomy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tamsulosin</b> {{has also}} {{affected}} sexual function in men. It can cause males to experience retrograde ejaculation. In males, retrograde ejaculation {{occurs when the}} fluid to be ejaculated, which would normally exit the body via the urethra, is redirected to the urinary bladder. Normally, the bladder sphincter contracts and the ejaculate goes to the urethra, the area of least pressure. In retrograde ejaculation, this sphincter does not function properly. This side effect can be mitigated by exercising the sphincter muscle; this is done by practicing a pumping action during ejaculation and urination - some semen fluid can then be ejaculated.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tamsulosin</b> and {{silodosin}} are selective α1 receptor blockers that preferentially bind to the α1A receptor in {{the prostate}} {{instead of the}} α1B receptor in the blood vessels. Less-selective α1 receptor blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin may lower blood pressure. The older, less selective α1-adrenergic blocker prazosin is not a first line choice for either high blood pressure or prostatic hyperplasia; it is a choice for patients who present with both problems at the same time. The older, broadly non-selective alpha blocker medications such as phenoxybenzamine are not recommended for control of BPH. Non-selective alpha blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin may also require slow dose adjustments as they can lower blood pressure and cause syncope (fainting) if {{the response to the}} medication is too strong.|$|E
50|$|Physicians {{sometimes}} use finasteride for {{the treatment}} of BPH, informally known as an enlarged prostate. Finasteride may improve the symptoms associated with BPH such as difficulty urinating, getting up during the night to urinate, hesitation at the start of urination, and decreased urinary flow. It provides less symptomatic relief than alpha-1 blockers such as <b>tamsulosin</b> and symptomatic relief is slower in onset (six months or more of treatment with finasteride may be required to determine the therapeutic results of treatment). Symptomatic benefits are mainly seen in those with prostate volume > 40 cm3. In long-term studies finasteride but not alpha-1 inhibitors reduce the risk of acute urinary retention (−57% at 4 years) and the need for surgery (−54% at 4 years). If the drug is discontinued, any therapeutic benefits reverse within about 6-8 months.|$|E
