500|$|... "I'm Goin' Down" [...] {{features}} an energetic rhythm, propelled by a heavy drumbeat by Weinberg, and contains a saxophone solo by Clemons. The music has a basic chord progression of A–E–F#m–D. In concerts in 1984, Springsteen introduced the song by describing the diminishing intimacy and sexual activity {{that can occur}} {{over the course of}} a romantic relationship: [...] " [...] you're making love to 'em all the time, three or four times a day. Then you come back a little bit later, and, uh-oh... it's like 'Are you gonna make love to me tonight, or are we gonna wait for the full moon again', y'know?" [...] The song's lyrics include lines such as [...] "I'm sick and tired of you setting me up / Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down" [...] and [...] "You used to love <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>me</b> wild / But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down". The lyrics later turn into a stream of gibberish syllables.|$|E
500|$|Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly {{agreed that}} the episode was [...] "another solid 30 Rock", but was {{somewhat}} less positive, writing that it [...] "didn't quite slay me like the last few episodes have." [...] In addition, Lyons was not thrilled with [...] the Jenna character, reporting [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since we've seen Jenna do something redemptive – and I'd settle for anything not strenuously vacant and narcissistic. I get that that's her bit, but... that note is starting <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>me</b> crazy." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning also delivered a mixed review of the episode, writing that he laughed [...] "quite a bit" [...] but said it ultimately [...] "felt like it could have been so much more." [...] Canning also concluded his review by stating that it [...] "fell shy of being an absolute classic." [...] Writing for The Palm Beach Post Kevin D. Thompson said [...] "While last night's episode was far from unwatchable, it wasn't one of the show's best, either. But as I've written before, a so-so 30 Rock is still better than 99 percent of TV's other so-called comedies." [...] Thompson noted that he was not thrilled with the return of Dean Winters as Dennis, and called his plot with Liz and Jenna [...] "the show's least interesting plot".|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{early in}} 1968, the group largely retired from touring, instead {{focusing}} on {{work in the}} studio. As the band was not available to promote their material, subsequent releases met with little success. The Kinks' next single, [...] "Wonderboy", released {{in the spring of}} 1968, stalled at number 36 and became the band's first single not to make the UK Top Twenty since their early covers. In the face of the band's declining popularity, Davies continued to pursue his personal song-writing style while rebelling against the heavy demands placed on him to keep producing commercial hits, and the group continued to devote time to the studio, centring on a slowly developing project of Ray's called Village Green. In an attempt to revive the group's commercial standing, the Kinks' management booked them on a month-long package tour for April, drawing the group away from the studio. The venues were largely cabarets and clubs; headlining was Peter Frampton's group The Herd. [...] "In general, the teenyboppers were not there to see the boring old Kinks, who occasionally had to endure chants of 'We Want The Herd!' during their brief appearances", commented Andy Miller. The tour proved taxing and stressful—Pete Quaife recalled, [...] "It was a chore, very dull, boring and straightforward... We only did twenty minutes, but it used <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>me</b> absolutely frantic, standing on stage and playing three notes over and over again." [...] At the end of June, the Kinks released the single [...] "Days", which provided a minor, but only momentary, comeback for the group. [...] "I remember playing it when I was at Fortis Green the first time I had a tape of it", Ray said. [...] "I played it to Brian, who used to be our roadie, and his wife and two daughters. They were crying at the end of it. Really wonderful—like going to Waterloo and seeing the sunset.... It's like saying goodbye to somebody, then afterwards feeling the fear that you actually are alone." [...] "Days" [...] reached number 12 in the United Kingdom and was a Top 20 hit in several other countries, but it did not chart in the United States.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I'm sorry," [...] {{said the}} young man. [...] "Then you won't be able <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> with <b>me</b> this morning? I hope {{she is n't}} seriously worse?" [...] he added, {{recurring}} to Mrs. Maynard {{at the sight of}} the trouble in Grace's face.|$|R

2500|$|Helen joined Benny Goodman in December 1939, {{with whom}} she {{recorded}} a number of celebrated songs, including the hit song [...] "The Man I Love." [...] Helen recorded 55 studio recordings with Goodman. She told the Pop Chronicles radio series: [...] "Benny would look right above your eyebrows, in the middle, {{right on top of}} the brow. He was a very strange man." [...] Forrest also stated, [...] "The band I joined was sensational, but few special arrangements were written for me. I sang choruses, and made myself fit to the music. Benny used <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>me</b> crazy by 'noodling' behind me on clarinet while I sang." [...] Goodman was also reported to have been a perfectionist and a very difficult man to work with. In August 1941, Forrest quit the orchestra [...] "to avoid having a nervous breakdown". [...] After leaving Goodman, Forrest briefly recorded with Nat King Cole and Lionel Hampton.|$|E

50|$|Raffetto {{suffered}} from tuberculosis {{for much of}} his life. He had to leave radio twice to recover. Morse often picked him up from the hospital <b>to</b> act. “He’d <b>drive</b> <b>me</b> home, or I’d take the train back to the hospital,” Raffetto later said. At times, episodes were broadcast from Raffetto’s bedside.|$|R

60|$|Even as a {{woman had}} lured me once from the ways to which I seemed predestined, only <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>me</b> back once more the more frenziedly, so now it almost seemed as if again a woman should have lured me to the world but <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>me</b> from it again and more resolutely than ever.

If Margharita's name is mentioned before him, he is either unusually silent and reserved, or very talkative. As a rule, you know, Lumley does not care for girls. That makes me all the more anxious." ...|$|R
6000|$|We now {{arrived at}} Mr. Boythorn's house, where the tea-table, all prepared, was {{awaiting}} us. Richard came in restless and hurried shortly afterwards, and leaning over Mr. Vholes's chair, whispered {{something in his}} ear.

5000|$|Turning {{her nose}} {{up at her}} family {{collection}} of more currently popular fare, Rose favored the [...] "queen bees" [...] of Nashville like Kitty Wells, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton. She also preferred [...] "country kingpins" [...] like Hank Williams, George Jones, and Keith Whitley. Rummaging through her grandparents’ cassette tapes, she discovered the Ronettes and “the ‘Runaround Sue’ guy,” Dion DiMucci. Of her taste for music, Rose says, “I still listen to that stuff today. And I did even through my teenage years. My friends never wanted <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> with <b>me</b> because I would not be listening to like quote-unquote cool music." ...|$|R
60|$|With rifle ready I {{cautiously}} {{approached the}} bear. As I came close he seemed larger and larger, but he {{showed no signs}} of life. I looked at the glossy black fur, the flecks of blood {{on the side of his}} head where my bullet had entered, the murderous saw-teeth of the heavy trap biting to the bone, and the cruelty of that trap seemed <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> from <b>me</b> all pride of achievement. It was nothing except mercy to kill a trapped crippled bear that could not run or fight. Then and there I gained a dislike for trapping animals.|$|R

60|$|He was <b>to</b> have <b>driven</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the station, some miles away, before noon, and I {{supposed}} {{we should}} sit down together, {{and try to}} have some sort of talk before I went. But Alderling appeared to have forgotten about my going, and after a while, took himself off to his studio, and left me alone to watch the inroads of the fog. It came on over the harbor rapidly, as on that morning when Mrs. Alderling had been so nearly lost in it, and presently the masts and shrouds of the shipping at anchor were sticking up out of it as if they were sunk into a body as dense as the sea under them.|$|R
5000|$|Jacobsen had Stone {{signed with}} Festival Records and in June 1961 she issued her debut single, [...] "You're <b>Driving</b> <b>Me</b> Mad" [...] - a cover {{version of the}} 1958 song by United States singer, Jo Ann Campbell. For the track she was backed by the Joy Boys. In August she {{relocated}} to Melbourne, for three months, to appear on Graham Kennedy's In Melbourne Tonight variety TV show. She expected that [...] "While in Melbourne most of my shows will be adult performances, which will be a change from the present teenagers' shows." [...] Her third single, [...] "I'll Step Down", was released in February 1962 and became a top 10 hit in Sydney and top 20 in Brisbane. The Biz correspondent compared it to her earlier single, [...] "Although very different <b>to</b> 'You're <b>Driving</b> <b>Me</b> Mad', this still possesses the inimitable style of this great little local star." [...] Also in that year Stone issued her debut album, I'll Step Down, on Festival.|$|R

I am almost certain that he was about the place last night. I saw some one who looked very much like him pass along the cliffs just about dinner-time." ...|$|R
