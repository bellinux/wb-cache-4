25|$|In {{addition}} to the separative work units provided by an enrichment facility, the other important parameter to be considered is the mass of natural uranium (NU) {{that is needed to}} yield a desired mass of enriched uranium. As with the number of SWUs, the amount of feed material required will also depend on the level of enrichment desired and upon the amount of 235U that ends up in the depleted uranium. However, unlike the number of SWUs required during enrichment, which increases with decreasing levels of 235U in the depleted stream, the amount of NU needed will decrease with decreasing levels of 235U <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> in the DU.|$|E

25|$|TSA rules {{state that}} if you move your fire demon next to an {{opposing}} fire demon, only your fire demon is immolated; all other adjacent pieces survive. This implies that a fire demon's passive burn (how it automatically burns enemy pieces <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> next to it without moving) is faster than its active burn (how it burns enemy pieces that it moves next to). A few computer programs and books stipulate that other adjacent pieces are immolated as well, with only the opposing fire demon surviving, but this interpretation is not widely followed. Both variants are playable, though the TSA rules are more consistent in not allowing the suicidal fire demon to burn anything at all.|$|E
25|$|Monocultures and {{invasive}} species. In {{an effort}} to cut costs, some tree-planting projects introduce fast-growing invasive species <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> damaging native forests and reducing biodiversity. For example, in Ecuador, the Dutch FACE Foundation has an offset project in the Andean Páramo involving 220 square kilometres of eucalyptus and pine planted. The NGO Acción Ecológica criticized the project for destroying a valuable Páramo ecosystem by introducing exotic tree species, causing the release of much soil carbon into the atmosphere, and harming local communities who had entered into contracts with the FACE Foundation to plant the trees. However, some certification standards, such as the Climate Community and Biodiversity Standard require multiple species plantings.|$|E
25|$|He {{came from}} a family of criminals: his father died when he was a child, and his mother died after being riddled by machine gun fire during a botched robbery attempt in his teenage years. He has three younger brothers, a set of {{triplets}} called Tim, Tom and Tumb, who are professional criminals and frequently try to use Bob as the scapegoat in their criminal schemes. Despite this, Bob refuses to follow the criminal career path and frequently berates his brothers for it, despite them being clearly more successful than Bob. He stopped berating them after they joined the TNT under The Great Caesar. Bob has a poetic side: he frequently tries to write books or poems <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> being rejected by even the worst publishers and/or ridiculed by other TNT members. He is mostly at odds with Number One for abnormally poor salary and his tyrannical attitude, and he is usually attacked by Number One with his stick when Bob provokes him.

25|$|The comic is set during World War II, and {{the protagonist}} - Ernie Pike - is the narrator, without playing {{an active role}} in the stories. Unlike genre standards, the comic does not show any battles, and neither {{describes}} the war between Allies and Nazis as a conflict between good and evil. Instead, it centers on tragic events involving soldiers of both sides. Generally, those tragedies are misunderstandings <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> badly: characters who go mad, kill their own friends by friendly fire or because they believe them to be traitors, attempt to get killed in a specific way to avoid a more gruesome death, or who must mercy-kill badly hurt comrades, to cite several examples. Oesterheld, thus, utilizes war comics to reflect his personal dislike of war itself. The character never formulates positive or negative opinions about the allies, the nazis or specific events of the war, but about the morality of the soldiers in the anecdotes narrated. The stories take place at multiple locations of World War II, such as the European Theatre, the South Pacific ocean, the North African Campaign and the Eastern Front.|$|E
25|$|Otto Grunf is a {{naturalized}} German-born inventor. He is {{a former}} Luftstreitkräfte mechanic who fought in the First World War, and he defected from the German army after his mechanical incompetence caused the airplane of the Red Baron to crash. He moved to America and changed his last name from Grunt to Grunf to avoid detection, and is mentioned to also serve in Second World War. He serves as the inventor, fabricator and the mechanic of the TNT group. Running gag in the series is his incompetence: he usually designs various Rube Goldberg machines <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> in failure, fails to properly service or change the vehicles or weaponry (driving a 1910s era car that usually explodes while attempting to start it or brandishing an 1880s revolver), or invents things that already exist (he claims to have invented the skateboard, which he named Skate-Grunf). Despite his heroic-like behavior and staunch belief in bravery (as seen by quotes stamped on his T-shirts), {{he is a very}} cowardly man, constantly running from danger. He usually dresses in a World War I-era flying ace uniform with goggles. He is very loyal and devoted to Number One and never is on his odds. His job is usually to drive Number One around New York (in other words, push his wheelchair around).|$|E
500|$|The drakes <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> {{being left}} out after the others have paired off with mating {{partners}} sometimes target an isolated female duck, even one of a different species, and proceed to chase and peck at her until she weakens, {{at which point the}} males take turns copulating with the female. Lebret (1961) calls this behaviour [...] "Attempted Rape Flight", and Stanley Cramp and K.E.L. Simmons (1977) speak of [...] "rape-intent flights". Male mallards also occasionally chase other male ducks of a different species, and even each other, in the same way. In one documented case of [...] "homosexual necrophilia", a male mallard copulated with another male he was chasing after the chased male died upon flying into a glass window.

500|$|Firearm {{examiners}} {{have attempted}} to determine the shooter's position by the location of spent bullet casings. The use of ejection pattern studies were originally part of incident reconstruction and methods for determining shooter location continue to be explained in major crime scene examination books. [...] However, the validity of ejection pattern analysis has been brought into question by multiple studies that look at the reproducibility and end determination of shooter position by qualified examiners. Studies have shown that over 25% of spent casings land somewhere other than {{to the right and}} rear of the shooter. This is the most commonly accepted location for where spent cartridge casings should fall, and the large percentage of casings <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> somewhere else raises concerns for the validity of the examination technique.

500|$|In a School Library Journal article, Anne Beier of the Hendrick Hudson Free Library in Montrose, New York {{gives the}} book a {{positive}} review, praising Birdsall's writing and describing {{the story as}} funny, sweet, heartwarming, and suspenseful. Beier especially praises the climactic scene of the dogs' capture by the bear, writing that the repeated story arc of running away is strong {{as a result of}} the increased tension. She calls the dog characters endearing and writes, [...] "This title will be a hit at storytime or in a one-on-one setting". Connie Fletcher of Booklist also gives the book a positive review, comparing the two eponymous characters to Pyramus and Thisbe, two lovers in Ovid's poem Metamorphoses. In her review, Fletcher calls the book [...] "a fun canine fantasy with humor, excitement, a happy ending, and, most important of all, two ridiculously adorable dogs <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> getting their way - as dogs tend to do".|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the relatively recent appearance of noctilucent clouds, and their gradual increase, {{may be linked to}} climate change. The author of the first cited study, atmospheric scientist Gary Thomas of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, has pointed out that the first sightings coincide with both Krakatoa and the nascent Industrial Revolution, and they have become more widespread and frequent throughout the twentieth century, including an uptick between 1964 and 1986. The connection of global warming to noctilucent clouds remains controversial, however. Gary Thomas may have penned his paper after Wilfried Schröder, who might hold the distinction of being the first to explain noctilucent clouds as [...] "indicators" [...] for atmospheric processes (Gerlands Beiträge zur Geophysik, 1971, Meteorologische Rundschau 1968–1970). Most recently in 2012 Lonnie Cumberland's physics PhD work supported viewing noctilucent clouds as a possible Miner's Canary for climate change as her third conclusion as a sign of increasing the presence of water in the high atmosphere. NASA scientists speculate that methane may be driven higher into the mesophere where noctilucent clouds form by climate change and through reactions <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> producing water at such altitudes.|$|E

[...] While Tammy 1 has an ice cold personality and reduces Ron into submissiveness and quietude, Tammy 2 causes Ron to make highly irrational decisions <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> jeopardizing his position at the Parks office. [...] Tammy 2 also tries to assume control of Ron through using manipulation of her body.

[...] He snaps back to his old self after witnessing a drinking contest between Tammy 1 and Tammy 0. [...] They then drink in order to win control over Ron. Leslie also enters this competition in hopes of freeing him of the Tammys, however she ends up failing miserably due to the high alcohol content of Swanson family mash and is the first one out of the contest. In the end, Ron finally comes to his senses and stands up for himself and tells both Tammys to leave.|$|E
500|$|Defending Flynn's personality, Levi {{explained}} that [...] "Deep down, Flynn {{has a good}} core, although that characteristic is brought out of him through the purity, love and naiveté of Rapunzel." [...] The actor concluded that [...] "These are two very different characters <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> learning a lot from each other on a rather crazy adventure." [...] According to Colin Covert of the Star Tribune, Flynn [...] "teaches [...] about courage". Rob Vaux of Mania.com described the character's relationship with Rapunzel as a [...] "partners-in-crime sort of chemistry, filled with mischief and the odd pratfall while establishing a rhythm wholly their own." [...] Rapunzel eventually convinces Flynn to go by his birth name, Eugene Fitzherbert, which Conny Eisfeld described in her book How Fairy Tales Live Happily Ever After: (Analyzing) The Art of Adapting Fairy Tales as [...] "more humane". Stephen D. Greydanus of Decent Films Guide called Flynn [...] "a charismatic bad boy", comparing him to Sinbad from DreamWorks' [...] (2003). Similarly, The New York Times Brooks Barnes felt that [...] "Making the leading man an unlikable thief is a subtle yet startling twist for Disney, and Flynn ... is glib {{in a way that}} many people now associate with DreamWorks." [...] On Flynn's thievery, Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum determined that the character [...] "only steals because he's basically a nice-guy underachiever who needs a better outlet for his leadership abilities". According to Tison Pugh, author of The Disney Middle Ages: A Fairy-Tale and Fantasy Past, Flynn [...] "amalgamates the comedy-action hero with the swashbuckling romantic sensations of Errol Flynn, layering them over a fairy-tale hero attributed with comedic lines that undermine the romantic nostalgia of the film's setting", while serving as a source of comic relief at times. Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times believes that Flynn carries [...] "most of the [...] modern humor". Likewise, Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail described Flynn as the film's [...] "main source of action, humour and, eventually, romance".|$|E
500|$|Lisa {{references}} Nixon's dog Checkers. In addition, the veterinarian is {{a reference}} to Vince Edwards, who played Ben Casey on the 1960s drama of the same name. Also, among the books <b>that</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> in the Simpsons' fireplace are The Lottery by Shirley Jackson, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, Fatherhood by Bill Cosby, and a book entitled Canine Surgery. Fatherhood was heavily referenced in the episode [...] "Saturdays of Thunder" [...] earlier this season. The scene in which Mr. Burns and Smithers brainwash Santa's Little Helper is a parody of A Clockwork Orange with Beethoven's [...] "Ode to Joy". The film uses footage of a kind that would aggravate a dog: a dog being hit with a rolled-up newspaper, a shoe kicking a water dish, a kitten playing with a ball of string, a tank running over a doghouse, a dog being hit on {{the head by a}} falling toilet seat, and finally [...] "footage" [...] of Lyndon Johnson holding his dog up in the air by the ears, which actually occurred. Music from Peter and the Wolf, a children's story composed by Sergei Prokofiev, is played over the wanderings of Santa's Little Helper through Springfield's outer domains. This episode also references several controversies about Michael Jackson; for example, Kent Brockman's butler tells Kent that his pet llama bit Ted Kennedy, and Mr. Burns is sleeping in an iron lung as part of his longevity treatment. This episode shows the first time where someone other than Homer says [...] "Doh!". Lisa exclaims it when she is assigned to do a book report on Copernicus and she realizes she does not have any reference books. In addition, the doctor, who was played by Hank Azaria, and the music that plays when he desperately attempts to save the hamster, is {{a reference to}} Ben Casey. One of the places to where Santa's Little Helper voyages, Swartzwelder County, where he rescues a baby from a burning house, is a reference to the writer of this episode, John Swartzwelder.|$|E
