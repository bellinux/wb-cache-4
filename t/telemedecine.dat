40|$|International audienceA new IP {{multimedia}} {{distributed system}} is presented. The two main functionalities are error-resilience for image and video transmission and {{storage and distribution}} of partial information among several servers {{in order to use}} different internet routes. The system is based on a redundant transform called the Mojette transform that projects the original information into different pieces. Our group has developed this transform for the last five years. The main theoretical results of the Mojette transform are recalled for the 2 -D and 3 -D cases. The transform is then used to break a data volume into several pieces and to transmit or store them with several levels of redundancy such that a receiver is able to reconstruct the original message by a subset of pieces despite erasures. The second main feature is to provide insufficient pieces onto a single server to avoid a network information theft whereas being able to use the redundancy located on other servers to rebuild the information after the network destruction of a server. The characteristics of this distributed system are exemplified. The relationships with quality of service and multiple description theory are analyzed and exemplified with the <b>telemedecine</b> case. Finally, a multiple description scheme with prioritized flows is defined and implemented. The Mojette operators and the resultant multimedia distributed architecture is valid both for any multimedia signals (image, video, voice) to be encoded and those already encoded and available as bit streams...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundDjibouti has no {{paediatric}} orthopaedics {{department and}} three options {{are available for}} difficult cases: transfer of the patient to another country; overseas mission transfer to Djibouti by a specialised surgical team; and management by a local orthopaedic surgeon receiving guidance from an expert. The extreme poverty of {{part of the population}} of Djibouti often precludes the first two options. <b>Telemedecine</b> can allow the local orthopaedic surgeon to receive expert advice. Hypotheses and study designWe prospectively recorded all the paediatric orthopaedics teleconsultations that occurred between November 2009 and November 2011. Our objective was to assess the performance of the teleconsultations. We hypothetized that this option was influential in decision making. Materials and methodsWe assessed the influence of the teleconsultation on patient management (i. e., change in the surgical indication and/or procedure). We then used the electronic patient records to compare the actual management to that recommended retrospectively by two independent orthopaedic surgeon consultants who had experience working overseas. Finally, we assessed the clinical outcomes in the patients. ResultsOf 48 teleconsultations for 39 patients, 13 dealt with diagnostic problems and 35 with therapeutic problems. The teleconsultation resolved the diagnostic uncertainties in 90 % of cases. Advice from the expert modified the management in 37 (77 %) teleconsultations; the change was related to the surgical indication in 18 cases, the surgical technique in 13 cases, and both in six cases. Agreement between the advice from the independent consultants and the treatment delivered by the local surgeon was 2. 2 / 3. Clinical outcomes were good or very good in 31 (81 %) of the 38 treated patients. ConclusionsThis study establishes the feasibility and usefulness of paediatric orthopaedics teleconsultations in Djibouti. The introduction of telemedicine has changed our approach to challenges raised by patients in remote locations or precarious situations. Input from experts considerably benefits patient management.

40|$|International audienceThe new {{information}} and communication technologies represent useful tools for improving the health system. Decisions on their implementation and use must be based on solid observations to assess their impacts on care and health. The difficult use of classical economic evaluation methods is due to the multidimensionality of the assessment of telemedicine implementations. Indeed, to evaluate the impact of the introduction of telemedicine, it is necessary to take into account various indicators identified in the literature, as cost, accessibility, acceptability and quality. Furthermore, they need to be considered with respect to all the stakeholders involved in the decision process (physicists, patients and hospital director). In this context, decision support theories provide additional insight into the evaluation of telemedicine. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a multicriteria evaluation methodology involving multiple decision makers for the establishment of remotely monitored medical dialysis solutions. To reach a decision, the hospital director wishes to take into account, next to the above mentionned indicators, the preferences of the physicians and the dialysis patients. In order to explicit these preferences, we suggest to consider that the patients and the physicians are decision makers which have to express a ranking of care modalities evaluated on multiple criteria. We thus face a situation involving multiple judges which overlay a multiplicity of viewpoints. To solve this problem, we use techniques both from social choice theory and multicriteria decision analysis. First we propose to agregate the individual rankings of the patients on the potential multicriteria care modalities into a patient-wide order (via the Borda count and Copeland's pairwise aggregation), which is then used in the multicriteria preference elicitation phasis of the physicians. The individual rankings of the latter ones is then aggregated into a physician-wide ranking which is then combined with the patients' one and further economical criteria to elicit the hospital director's preferences on the care modalities. This methodology is applied to the implementation of medical dialysis units in Brittany (France), on basis of the preferences of 16 patients, 8 physicians and 1 hospital director. The preferences of all the stakeholders of this decision process are representable by additive value models. The preferred alternative among the patients and the physicians is the medical dialysis unit with remote monitoring. The criterion which has the highest impact on the patients' (resp. physicians') decision is the distance to the dialysis unit (resp. the patients' satisfaction). Finally, the analysis shows that the most important criteria for the hospital director are the physicians' and the patients' satisfaction (which are generally not considered). This work shows that it is important to consider the heterogeneity and the multiplicity of viewpoints and actors in the evaluation of the implementation of remotely monitored medical dialysis solutions via multicriteria decision support techniques. We believe that this approach is an important stepping stone in the evaluation of <b>telemedecine...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{face the}} {{socio-economic}} and medico-social problems of {{elderly and disabled}} people, many territories in many countries have started local initiatives to find technical, medical, social and economical issues. In this frame, universities clearly have an increasing {{important role to play}} through many aspects: - Universities can provide new specific trainings with new diplomas relative to assistive technologies including e-health (telecare and <b>telemedecine)</b> and also ICT systems (including home automation). - Through research and academic exchange programs, universities networks can provide new joint diplomas dealing with common territorial problems, for example through Erasmus and Erasmus Mundus programs. To face the problems of elderly and disabled people in a rural environment, the district of Guéret (department of Creuse in France) has created the "Home automation and Health Pole". The aim is to drive a coherent action plan in terms of comfort, safety, autonomy and communication for the elderly and disabled people. In cunjunction, the University of Limoges now proposes since september 2008, a BSc degree dedicated to "Home automation for elderly and disabled people" based on the use of e-technologies together with home automation techniques. Many industrial partners are involved in the academic program of the BSC to make sure it fits the job market requirements. To emphasize as much as possible the benefit of its diplomas, the University of Limoges is also resolutely committed to expanding its international cooperation, at different levels: - Through students and faculty mobility (through Erasmus and Leonardo programs) - Through educational programs with the development of innovative joint diplomas The objective is to build new educational and research cooperative networks to share experiments and competences in technical and social domains. At the first level, the "Home automation for elderly and disabled people" BSC has set up agreements (mostly through Erasmus) with partner universities to provide work placements abroad : - VIA college university in Horsens, Denmark, - DOMUS laboratory at the University of Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada, - TUSUR Tomsk State University of Control Systems and Radioelectronics in Tomsk, Russia, - Bogazici University (University of Bosphorus) in Istanbul, Turkey. Six of the 24 BSc students will do their internships in these partner universities in 2010. At the second level, the next step is now to build a new international joint Master diploma in the field of "Intelligent decisional systems for people in loss of autonomy". This project has started initially within the frame of the Franco-Norwegian Åsgard program. This program is intended to: * stimulate exchanges between France and Norway in terms of the expertise and scientific competences, * emphasize the initiatives of cooperation in research & development, * enable French and Norwegian researchers to extend their own international networks. In this Master diploma project, several partner universities (from France, Belgium, Denmark and Norway) are {{now in the process of}} building together a complete master academic program for a new diploma opening in September 2012. Details of the BSc and MSc academic programs, and examples of scientific and technical experiments will be given at the conference to illustrate the fallout of the university network in terms of educational, social, industrial and research aspects...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} efforts {{presented in this}} paper fit in a larger research project, Painvision [1, 2], that aims at recognizing pain in real-time in demented elderly suffering from Alzheimer’s disease by means of a camera system. Typically demented elderly in the last stage of their disease, are unable to communicate verbally [3]. A camera based system can monitor these patient’s facial expressions 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. If a patient becomes uncomfortable, the camera based system can alarm a caregiver immediately. One of the Painvision challenges is to recognize facial pain expressions out of the video stream in real-time. Focusing on patients, this is not only a Painvision challenge {{as can be seen in}} similar research done by Becouze et al. [4]. They developed an image processing algorithm to measure the degree of facial grimacing in patients using a single digital camera. This algorithm can process 2. 5 frames per second (fps) using a MATLAB® implementation, which is not real-time as they want to process 30 fps. Our real-time constraint is set at a processing speed of less than 50 ms for one image (which is 20 fps). This is considered to be a standard timing constraint. By experimentation we identified the normalization step as the most computationally intensive part of the pain recognition algorithm. This step outputs frontal images of the patient’s face on a predefined mask, independent of the pose and distance of the patient from the camera. This size and pose normalization makes the machine learning techniques more robust and perform better later on the expression recognition algorithm steps. This normalization step is based on a dense affine transform (warp) which is pixel based, and therefore very computationally intensive. The current implementation in MATLAB® [5] cannot be performed in real-time. In this paper we present four different implementations of the affine transformation, and compare these implementations based on their processing time. Moreover, the goal of this research was to investigate which implementation is suitable for a real-time application. The first implementation discussed is the MATLAB® implementation. MATLAB® is a high-level programming environment and is commonly used to develop and test algorithms. However, no real-time processing times should be expected [4, 6]. Significant faster processing times can be expected by the C++ implementations using Open source Computer Vision (OpenCV) [7 - 9], or the Open source Graphics Library (OpenGL) [10 - 12]. The last implementation is a hardware based alternative. A Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), is used to implement the algorithm onto hardware. We decided to program this device using a high-level modular design strategy, based on a Simulink® model [5]. In combination with Xilinx System Generator [13] a Simulink® model can be automatically translated into the appropriate Hardware Description Language (HDL) code required to configure the FPGA. Measurements indicate that a hardware implementation is the fastest (1. 1 ms), followed by the OpenGL implementation (1. 3 ms). Moreover, the OpenCV implementation is considerably faster compared to MATLAB® (24. 4 ms and 153. 7 ms respectively). As MATLAB® is our reference implementation, we calculated the mean squared error of each output image compared with the MATLAB® output image. With a mean squared error between 3. 7 and 4. 2 we can conclude that all three alternative implementations produce a comparable output image. [1]	Painvision. In [URL] accessed on September 2009.
