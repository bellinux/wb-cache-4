After learning that the senate was now planning to individually serve the four subpoenas directly to the four officers, the associate chief of the Air Force litigation division accepted the subpoenas.|$|E

After Craig and <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> left <b>the</b> restroom, Craig was reluctant to go with <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> and demanded <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> show his police identification a second time. Once <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> complied with <b>the</b> request, Craig, <b>the</b> arresting <b>officer,</b> and a police detective, who was stationed outside of the restroom, went to the airport police station.|$|R

50|$|The {{state of}} Pennsylvania {{believes}} that <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> had {{no evidence to}} be suspicious of Mimms during the stop whether it was his behavior or unusual activity; nothing was evident during the patrol. The state discovered that <b>the</b> <b>officer,</b> during every routine traffic stop, ordered the drivers to exit their vehicles. The state defends <b>the</b> <b>officer,</b> saying that this practice was used to prevent anything from happening to <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> {{and that it could}} have been reasonable under those circumstances. Being in front of <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> makes it impossible to have something suspicious go unseen if the driver were to attempt something to harm <b>the</b> <b>officer.</b>|$|R

Beetle agrees, and <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults <b>the</b> <b>officers,</b> they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback uses the handcuffs, still hanging from his wrist, to beat <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> into unconsciousness.|$|E
5|$|Stan {{tries to}} persuade Randy {{to tell the}} truth about the stolen magnet, but Randy refuses in order to avoid embarrassment. As the pair works on the warp drive, an Intergalactic Police ship {{approaches}} Earth; McGeezax cloaks his ship and drags Stan out of sight as a hostage, leaving the townspeople to divert the officers' questions. <b>The</b> <b>officers</b> say that McGeezax stole a large sum of space cash, but no one admits to seeing him, and <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> leave. Randy then provides a diversion for McGeezax while Stan, at Randy's insistence, stabs him to death with a shank. McGeezax's ship is found to contain the stolen space cash, but instead of returning it, Randy persuades everyone to divide it among themselves. Randy, in contact with all world leaders, buys other countries' silence by giving them a share. Four days later, <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> return to South Park. They now know that McGeezax landed here and Randy tells them of his death, but everyone denies finding any space cash.|$|E

50|$|In a 7-2 vote, the Court {{overturned}} the lower courts' decision and ruled that <b>the</b> <b>officer's</b> search of containers within the car {{were not considered}} unreasonable. Since a reasonable person would expect narcotics to be carried in a container, and because <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> told Jimeno of his suspicions, the Court ruled that <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> acted within reason. Jimeno was thus found guilty and <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> was not {{in violation of the}} 4th amendment.|$|R
50|$|To harass <b>the</b> <b>officer,</b> <b>the</b> conscripts {{would gather}} in a group, {{the larger the}} better, and wait out of sight for an officer.

5000|$|In {{subsequent}} criminal proceedings, {{in federal}} district court, the defendant moved {{to suppress the}} frisk-acquired gun evidence {{on the ground that}} <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> violated <b>the</b> defendant's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures -- arguing that <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> didn't have [...] "reasonable suspicion" [...] to frisk him. More specifically, the defendant argued that <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> didn't believe, reasonably, that his safety was threatened -- nor the safety of others -- before conducting <b>the</b> pat-down. <b>The</b> <b>officer</b> countered that <b>the</b> defendant had exhibited suspicous behavior that justified the frisk. Relying heavily on the “indisputable video evidence” that contradicted <b>the</b> <b>officer’s</b> testimony on multiple points, the judge agreed with the defense, and barred the evidence of the handgun. Further, the judge suggested that <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> may have altered his original report after viewing the COPS video.|$|R
5|$|Alarmed by {{the actions}} of the Temeraires crew, Campbell met with Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell the {{following}} day and informed him of the mutineers' demands. Mitchell reported the news to the Admiralty while Campbell returned to Temeraire and summoned the crew on deck once more. He urged them to return to duty, and then dismissed them. Meanwhile, discipline had begun to break down among the mutineers. Several of the crew became drunk, and some of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> were struck by rowdy seamen. When one of the marines who supported the mutiny was placed in irons for drunken behaviour and insolence, a crowd formed on deck and tried to free him. <b>The</b> <b>officers</b> resisted these attempts and as sailors began to push and threaten them, Campbell gave the order for the marines to arrest those he identified as the ringleaders. The marines hesitated, but then obeyed the order, driving the unruly seamen back and arresting a number of them, who were immediately placed in irons. Campbell ordered the remaining crew to abandon any mutinous actions, and deprived of its leaders, the mutiny collapsed, though <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> were on their guard for several days afterwards and the marines were ordered to carry out continuous patrols.|$|E

5000|$|According to R (Fullard) v Woking Magistrates' Court (2005) EWHC 2922 (Admin) a constable {{cannot be}} {{acting in the}} {{execution}} of their duty when unlawfully on private property. Thus, if <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> is not acting {{under the authority of}} a warrant, acting under a statutory or common law power of entry, or in hot pursuit, the person lawfully in possession of land is entitled to withdraw permission for <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> to remain. Should <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> refuse to leave, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> will cease to be [...] "acting in the execution of their duty". To make an effective withdrawal of permission, clear words must be used. Merely directing offensive remarks at <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> which amount to 'go away' will not necessarily withdraw any implied permission to enter or remain. Further, when properly required to leave, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> must be allowed a reasonable opportunity to leave. However, once the opportunity to leave voluntarily has passed, it will not be an assault for the land owner to use reasonable force to cause <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> to leave.|$|R
