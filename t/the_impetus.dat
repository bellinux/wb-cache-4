50|$|The {{book was}} first {{published}} in 1995 by the University of California Press. A second edition was published in 1999.

5|$|Harris {{cites the}} success of the {{adaptation}} of The X-Files for providing <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> for a Millennium comic, noting that IDW editor-in-chief Chris Ryall approached him to write the latter series having seen the reception the former had been receiving. Harris himself had been a fan of the series during its initial broadcast, personally favouring its second season. He also expressed interest in possibly adapting another of Carter's creations, Harsh Realm.|$|E
5|$|One might {{surmise that}} the {{hermeneutic}} style was cultivated energetically in England {{in an attempt}} to show that English learning was as profound and English writing as sophisticated as anything produced on the Continent. <b>The</b> <b>impetus</b> for the cultivation of the style in tenth-century England was therefore probably of Continental origin.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei If... was {{developed}} as a change from previous Shin Megami Tensei titles, focusing on a small-scale environment and threat rather than a large-scale environment as in previous titles. Upon release, If... received a positive reception from critics and fans, and inspired multiple tie-in print adaptations and a mobile prequel. Its well-received high school setting was <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> {{for the creation of}} the spin-off Persona series.|$|E

5|$|This {{population}} {{issue was}} {{a significant part of}} <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> for the recent merger of Old Ikata with Seto and Misaki. While Old Ikata is geographically more accessible, and has enjoyed the economic benefits of the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant, Seto and Misaki have experienced even more severe aging and decline of their populations. In 2000, Seto's working-age population dipped below 50% of its total.|$|E
5|$|With the {{background}} of a buildup in tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States, and the deployment of Soviet RSD-10 Pioneer ballistic missiles targeting Western Europe, NATO decided, under <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> of the Carter presidency, to deploy MGM-31 Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe, primarily West Germany. This deployment would have placed missiles just 10minutes' striking distance from Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Home to Aboriginal {{groups for}} over 40,000 years, the Riverina was {{originally}} settled by Europeans in {{the mid-19th century}} as a pastoral region providing beef and wool to markets in Australia and beyond. In the 20th century, the development of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys {{has led to the}} introduction of crops such as rice and wine grapes. The Riverina has strong cultural ties to Victoria, and the region was the source of much of <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> behind the federation of Australian colonies.|$|E

50|$|They did not {{complete}} the 1955 season, as they {{dropped out of the}} League - the second squad to do so that season, following the Galveston White Caps. They played their final game of the season on June 29. Team owner J. C. Stroud cited poor attendance, personal ailing health and external pressure from other clubs to shut down the Tyler ball club as <b>the</b> <b>impetuses</b> for <b>the</b> team's dropping out.|$|R
5000|$|Amongst his 20th century English {{influences}} are the pastoralism {{and extended}} tonality of Herbert Howells, {{the richness of}} Walton, the elegant delicacy of Berkeley and <b>the</b> jazzy <b>impetus</b> of Rodney Bennett; wider European influences include the caustic irony of Shostakovich and Kurt Weil and <b>the</b> rhythmic <b>impetus</b> of Prokofiev and Stravinsky. Yet Dawes welds from his influences an individual voice that is distinctive and refreshing, displaying assured craftsmanship and characterful invention. (Malcolm Miller 2008) ...|$|R
5|$|NATO had decided, under <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> of the Reagan administration, {{to deploy}} Pershing II and cruise {{missiles}} in West Germany. This deployment would have placed missiles just 6â€“10 minutes striking distance from Moscow. Support for the deployment was wavering {{and it looked}} doubtful {{that it would be}} carried out. When the Soviet Union shot down Flight 007, the U.S. was able to galvanize enough support at home and abroad to enable the deployment to go ahead.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{initially}} {{focused on}} a comprehensive ban, but this was abandoned due to technical questions surrounding the detection of underground tests and Soviet concerns over the intrusiveness of proposed verification methods. <b>The</b> <b>impetus</b> for the test ban was provided by rising public anxiety over the magnitude of nuclear tests, particularly tests of new thermonuclear weapons (hydrogen bombs), and the resulting nuclear fallout. A test ban was also seen {{as a means of}} slowing nuclear proliferation and the nuclear arms race. Though the PTBT did not halt proliferation or the arms race, its enactment did coincide with a substantial decline in the concentration of radioactive particles in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{returned}} from the Antarctic having narrowly failed to reach the Pole, and this gave Scott <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> to proceed with plans for his second Antarctic expedition. On 24 March 1909, {{he had taken the}} Admiralty-based appointment of naval assistant to the Second Sea Lord which placed him conveniently in London. In December he was released on half-pay, to take up the full-time command of the British Antarctic Expedition 1910, {{to be known as the}} Terra Nova Expedition from its ship, Terra Nova.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>impetus</b> for {{federation}} did {{not extend}} to the administration of cricket, however. The ACC continued to attract criticism for being ineffectual and {{at a meeting of}} the Victorian Cricket Association in July 1898, Trott (in his capacity as a delegate for the South Melbourne club) tabled a motion that Victoria secede from the ACC. Although the proposal was defeated by a single vote, Trott was one of twelve Test players who signed a letter to the ACC secretary calling for the disbanding of the organisation. Failing to win the support of the players, the ACC folded in January 1900 following the withdrawal of the New South Wales Cricket Association.|$|E
5|$|The {{microscopic}} {{characteristics and}} cytogenetics of C.micaceus are well known, {{and it has}} been used frequently as a model organism to study cell division and meiosis in Basidiomycetes. Chemical analysis of the fruit bodies has revealed the presence of antibacterial and enzyme-inhibiting compounds. Formerly known as Coprinus micaceus, the species was transferred to Coprinellus in 2001 as phylogenetic analyses provided <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> for a reorganization of the many species formerly grouped together in the genus Coprinus. Based on external appearance, C.micaceus is virtually indistinguishable from C.truncorum, {{and it has been}} suggested that many reported collections of the former may be of the latter.|$|E
5|$|The missionaries {{were forced}} to proceed slowly, and could not do much about {{eliminating}} pagan practices, or destroying temples or other sacred sites, unlike the missionary efforts {{that had taken place}} in Gaul under St Martin. There was little fighting or bloodshed during the mission. Paganism was still practised in Kent until the 630s, and it was not declared illegal until 640. Although Honorius sent Felix to the East Angles, it appears that most of <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> for conversion came from the East Anglian king.|$|E

5|$|While in Washington, Lead Belly {{encountered}} {{several other}} incidents of segregation that {{are believed to}} have contributed to <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> of the song. For instance, when Lead Belly, Lomax, and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together, they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them. Lead Belly was told that if he returned later without Lomax, he would be served.|$|E
5|$|Wulfhelm {{also went}} to Rome to receive his pallium in person from Pope John X. Why he chose to go to Rome in person for his pallium rather than having it sent to him like most of his {{predecessors}} is unknown. One suggestion has been that {{because he had been}} translated from another see, Wulfhelm felt the need to have papal approval of his translation made explicit. Given the low status of the papacy at the time, it is unlikely that <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> for the change in tradition came from the pope.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on May 14, which {{is believed to have been}} <b>the</b> <b>impetus</b> to Barbara. The wave axis crossed Central America on May 25 and emerged into the eastern North Pacific Ocean the next day. Interacting with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a broad surface low pressure area developed within the area on May 27, and as it drifted northward the system maintained limited and disorganized convection. On May 29, convection increased and became concentrated near the low pressure center, and banding features developed in its eastern semicircle as the circulation became better defined. It is estimated the system formed into Tropical Depression Two-E at 1800UTC on May 29 about 115miles (185km) southeast of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was stationary in an area with warm sea surface temperatures, very light wind shear, and favorable upper-level conditions.|$|E
