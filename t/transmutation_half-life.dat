40|$|In {{this paper}} we review {{materials}} characterization techniques using radioactive isotopes at the ISOLDE/CERN facility. At ISOLDE intense beams of chemically clean radioactive isotopes {{are provided by}} selective ion-sources and high-resolution isotope separators, which are coupled on-line with particle accelerators. There, new experiments are performed by {{an increasing number of}} materials researchers, which use nuclear spectroscopic techniques such as Mössbauer, Perturbed Angular Correlations (PAC), beta-NMR and Emission Channeling with short-lived isotopes not available elsewhere. Additionally, diffusion studies and traditionally non-radioactive techniques as Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy, Hall effect and Photoluminescence measurements are performed on radioactive doped samples, providing in this way the element signature upon correlation of the time dependence of the signal with the isotope <b>transmutation</b> <b>half-life.</b> Current developments, applications and perspectives of using radioactive ion beams and techniques in solid state and biophysics research are presented with a few examples...|$|E
40|$|A new {{transmutation}} concept; “two stage transmutation ” of the actinide wastes is proposed. In the concept, {{the lower}} actinides such as neptunium and americium are transmuted {{in the high}} flux field with well thermalized spectrum at the first stage. The wastes are transmuted very fast owing to the high flux and the high effective cross sections. The <b>transmutation</b> <b>half-life</b> for the actinide waste discharged from the spent fuel is about 15 days in the flux of 1. 0 x 1016 n/cm 2 /sec. At the second stage, the higher actinide such as curium, which is the residual at the first stage, is transmuted in the slightly hard spectrum optimized for 2 MCm which slows down the transmutation speed because of the low effective cross section. A reactor facility “A-Burner ” is designed for the concept. The core of A-Burner is based on ANS currently being designed by ORNL. A-Burner consists of a small core and a large D 20 reflector. The first and second stage transmutations are performed in the reflector and the central region of the core, respectively. The core characteristics and the transmutation performance are calculated with the newest nuclear data files; JENDL- 3 and ENDF/B-VI. The calculation indicates that the core with the actinide wastes could be operated for the same cycle length as ANS. The actinide wastes of 29 kg could be reduced to be 0. 2 kg in one year. By re-loading the actinide residual into the central region, the wastes become finally 0. 5 g by five years transmutation. A-Burner with this two stage transmutation concept allows to reduce the hazard index below that of the equivalent natural uranium and makes us free from the long-time management of the actinide wastes.
