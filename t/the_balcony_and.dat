5|$|Martin Nyrop {{was one of}} {{the main}} proponents of the National Romantic style. The main aim was to use {{distinctive}} Nordic motifs from the distant past, as is clearly demonstrated in Copenhagen City Hall which was completed in 1905. The City Hall is certainly Copenhagen's most monumental and most original building from the last quarter of the 19th century with its impressive facade, the golden statue of Absalon just above <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> its tall, slim clock tower. It was inspired by the Siena City Hall.|$|E
5|$|The Town Hall {{was built}} in 1778, with the porch and arcade being added in 1861 and <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> round windows in 1932. It is a Grade II listed building.

The building also houses the magistrates courts and other offices. The Assize court last sat here in October 1970.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} is eight minutes long. Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård plays Gaga's boyfriend. The video {{features}} a murderous plot line involving a doomed starlet who is constantly followed by photographers. The video {{opens with a}} shot of a seaside mansion, where Gaga and her boyfriend are shown lying on a bed talking in Swedish. They move to <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> start making out; however, when hidden photographers start taking pictures of them, Gaga realizes that her boyfriend has set the paparazzi to photograph her and tries to stop him.

5|$|The video {{opens with}} a scene of the ocean at night. It then shows a mansion by the water, in which Buena is seen {{standing}} by a balcony. The following scene shows Range entering the mansion as two men open the doors for her. Buena is shown walking {{in the middle of}} a masquerade ball, in which she captures the attention of a man. The Sugababes are shown on a couch, where Buchanan holds a man's hand; they all then walk down the mansion's staircase. Each group member begins to dance with a man at the ball. Buena walks towards a mirror which depicts a reflection of the Sugababes, while Buchanan drops her white mask which subsequently shatters. Towards the end of the video, they are shown leaving the ball before Buchanan jumps off <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> into the water.

To entertain the attendees that have arrived at Pooja's (Renuka Shahane) baby shower, her sister Nisha (Madhuri Dixit) and her husband's cousin Rita (Sahila Chadha) arrange a comic skit. While Nisha is presented as a pregnant lady with a pillow stuffed belly, Rita is seen in a young man's get-up which resembles to that of Prem (Salman Khan) who is Pooja's devar (younger brother-in-law). Throughout the song's lyrics, Nisha tells everyone of how Prem is deewana (crazy) and always tries to woo girls. The fake Prem, i.e. Rita, always tries to flirt and tease all the ladies, especially Nisha. He also hits Nisha's bum with a marigold flower, using a slingshot. Afterwards, the fake Prem is shown being beaten by all the present ladies. Then, the real Prem, who was secretly watching the comic skit, comes in and hits Nisha's bum again with a marigold flower. Following this, Prem jumps off <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> hangs onto the chandelier. Afraid of being caught red handed in imitating him, Nisha and Rita try to run away. Surprisingly, Prem begs pardon for his behaviour towards Nisha. The video ends with Prem faking a pregnant lady in lingerie.

Taylor, {{seeking an}} indoor home venue for the {{basketball}} team, {{reached an agreement}} with the Ben Hur Temple in downtown Austin to rent the building's theater for basketball games and five hours of practice weekly for the 1913 season for $75. The building was originally constructed in 1872 as an opera house for the Turnverein, a German gymnastics, social, and cultural society, and it had been purchased in 1912 by the Shriners and Scottish Rite Masons. Basketball goals were mounted on <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> in front of the stage, boundary lines were drawn on the double-layer pine floor, and bleachers were erected {{on each side of the}} diminutive court, bringing seating capacity to roughly 350 people, including spectators in <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> on the stage.|$|E

She then {{picks up the phone and}} tells the police she would like to report a double murder.|$|E
25|$|The battlements and machicolations {{are still}} {{visible on the}} walls, with the beams of another on the top floors. This part of the tower is covered in a barrel vault, while a terrace is located on its surface, with an {{external}} staircase to access the second floor (between the floor and roof), allowing communication between both by doorway. Small caliber artillery or machicolations, probably, supported <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> wall.

25|$|She invites {{one of the}} detectives, Kenji Mamiya (真宮 賢治 Mamiya Kenji, Satoshi Nikaido), back to the {{high-rise}} apartment {{she shares}} with her father. Wrongly supposing that the detectives are investigating her father's involvement in her mother's suicide, she explains to Mamiya that her father was asleep when her mother jumped off <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> that she witnessed this herself. It turns out the detectives are investigating a hunting trip Yasujiro took in Morocco. Soon after learning this, Chieko approaches Mamiya nude and attempts to seduce him.

25|$|Lastly, {{almost every}} {{fighting}} scene has a middle point {{which has a}} strong effect on combat. On a ship, this is the flight of stairs leading from the poop deck or forecastle onto the main deck. In a tavern, this is <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> the stairs leading up to it. If a combatant has been pushed {{all the way to}} the middle point, a cut scene will show the two combatants moving past the obstacle. On a ship, they run down or up the stairs. In a tavern, the enemy will be knocked down the gallery, and the player will run up the stairs. This has the effect of giving time for the advantage bar to swing back to the neutral position, equalizing the fight somewhat during this cut scene.|$|E
25|$|The Tiara {{immediately}} {{brings them}} to the World of Sleeping Beauty. The three fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, provide gowns and outfits for the trio, but Kilala's dress turns into that of a maid and is forced {{to work at the}} castle's party for Princess Aurora's 17th birthday. Kilala helps Prince Phillip's little cousin find a glass bead. When they do find it, the little princess gives it to her as a token for her help.

Maleficent appears (disguise as Lady Malecent) and attempts to curse Aurora with magic rose thorns. Kilala shields the princess and falls under the spell. Rei breaks Maleficent's magic with true love's kiss. Right after Maleficent is defeated, the glass bead turns into a rose quartz and joins with the Tiara.|$|E

25|$|Between 2002 and 2003, the {{courthouse}} underwent a major restoration that involved, not only electrical, mechanical and plumbing improvements {{as well as}} necessary accessibility enhancements such as the installation of an elevator, but also the correction of many architecturally insensitive modifications undergone previously. These included restoring <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> original furnishings in the courtroom and faux wood and metal ceiling finishes throughout the building. Exterior improvements included repairs to doors, windows and masonry, a new metal shingle roof, sheet metal repairs to cornices, and renovation of the clock tower. These renovations were performed {{at a cost of}} $2.8 million supported by a THC grant of $2.3 million with the remainder supported by local funding. The grant was administered as part of the THC's Texas Historic Courthouse Preservation Program, created to support counties preserve their current and former historic courthouses after the state's historic courthouses were included in the 1998 listing of most endangered historic places by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.|$|E
25|$|Two months later, it is {{revealed}} that Dennis and Gavin {{are still in}} contact. After another six weeks, Margaret visits Sharon, saying that Gavin is acting strangely, but Sharon dismisses this and sends Margaret away. Later, Gavin tells Kathy he has Dennis so she reluctantly gets {{in his car and}} is seen leaving by Buster Briggs (Karl Howman). Sharon sees that Dennis has been in contact with Gavin and Buster tells Sharon what he saw so, fearing for Kathy's safety, they get Gavin's address from Dennis. Kathy and Gavin arrive at a large country house that he bought with Sharon's money, and he locks them in, saying they can live there together.

Sharon realises it is Margaret, and she and Buster break into the house where Buster finds Kathy while Sharon confronts Gavin, who is packing a bag with cash. Sharon locks the door and Gavin insists that Margaret's death was an accident. Sharon asks him why he stayed in contact with Dennis when she paid him to stay away, so he says he would never harm his grandson. She tells him to give himself up to the police and if he does so, she will visit him in prison with Dennis and they can be a family when he gets released. Police and paramedics then arrive, as Sharon called them and Gavin accuses her of stalling until they arrived, but she insists she called them for Margaret's sake. Gavin says he will give himself up to the police so Sharon unlocks the bedroom door, but he then tries to escape. He sees his only way out is via the balcony but he is too scared of harming himself to jump. Sharon joins him on <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> he asks Sharon to tell the police that Margaret fell. A police officer then arrives on <b>the</b> <b>balcony</b> <b>and</b> Gavin grabs Sharon, threatening to jump, killing them both. Sharon says he could never kill himself so he lets her go and she tells him it is over between them. Gavin is then arrested.|$|E
