40|$|An {{analytical}} method for {{the determination of}} tetra-alkylthiuram disulphides has been developed, based on the quantitative oxidation of carbon disulphide produced by acidified chloramine-T to sulphuric and formic acids. Twenty-eight equivalents of chloramine-T are required per mole of a <b>thiuram</b> <b>disulphide...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} the {{volumetric}} determination of tetraalkyl <b>thiuram</b> <b>disulphide</b> is developed. It {{is based on}} its reaction with potassium cyanide in aqueous acetonitrile medium, when the corresponding tetraalkyl thiuram monosulphide and thiocyanate are formed. The former is removed by extraction with benzene and the latter converted into cyanogen bromide, which is estimated iodometrically...|$|E
40|$|The {{amounts of}} {{trichloroethanol}} and trichloroacetic acid excreted {{in the urine}} of four subjects who inhaled trichloroethylene in a concentration of about 1 mg. /l. {{for a period of}} five hours in a laboratory experiment were determined. This experiment was repeated under the same con-ditions after tetraethyl <b>thiuram</b> <b>disulphide</b> (disulfiram) had been given in divided doses, totalling 3 or 3 - 5 g. The elimination of trichloroethanol in urine was decreased by 40 to 64 %, and of trichloroacetic acid by 72 to 87 %. The trichloroethylene excreted by the lungs in two of the subjects increased up to 65 % of that retained within five hours. It is concluded that tetraethyl <b>thiuram</b> <b>disulphide</b> (disulfiram) strikingly inhibits the oxidation of trichloroethylene. The possible therapeutic use of this substance in cases of severe peroral trichloroethylene intoxication is discussed. In considering the toxicity of trichloroethylene (TRI) it is necessary to bear in mind the effect both of the whole molecule and that of its main meta-bolite trichloroethanol (TCE). Since TRI itself is very rapidly eliminated from the organism throug...|$|E
40|$|In 1903 von Braun and Stechele (1) {{showed that}} <b>thiuram</b> <b>disulphides</b> on {{treatment}} with potassiun cyanide were converted into the corresponding thiuran monosulph 1 des.

40|$|The {{effect of}} some close {{structural}} analogues of disulfiram on {{the activity of}} the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenases of sheep liver was studied. Several <b>thiuram</b> <b>disulphides</b> are equally potent inhibitors of the cytoplasmic enzyme, but in all cases the mitochondrial enzyme is much less strongly affected. Tetramethylthiuram monosulphide decreases {{the activity of the}} cytoplasmic enzyme in a process apparently involving a covalent interaction...|$|R
40|$|Spectrophotometric {{studies of}} {{dichloromethane}} solutions containing iodine and some Cr(S 2 CNR 2) 3 complexes (where R 2 NCS- 2 are: OC 4 H 8 NCS- 2 = modtc; (C 2 H 5) 2 NCS- 2 = Et 2 dtc; (C 6 H 5 CH 2) 2 NCS- 2 = Bz 2 dtc) {{have shown the}} formation of 1 : 1 adducts whose spectral features were studied and which suggested that charge-transfer interaction involving iodine and a sulphur atom of a coordinated dithiocarbamato ligand occurred. A new BASIC non-linear least-squares program which performs an optimization of the absorbance data taken at several wavelengths was devised to evaluate reliable formation constants. The thermodynamic parameters have been calculated and compared with those obtained in the same conditions as above by a reinvestigation of the known 1 : 1 complex formation of iodine with the corresponding tetraalkylthiuram-disulphides, where the donor site is also the sulphur atom of the thiocarbonyl group. The -ΔH° values related to the Cr(dtc) 3 · I 2 complexes are about 2 kcal {{lower than those of}} <b>thiuram</b> <b>disulphides,</b> showing a lowering of the donor strength of the thiocarbonyl sulphur {{as a consequence of the}} coordination to the metal. © 1984...|$|R
40|$|A “grafting from” {{approach}} {{has been used for}} controlled deposition of cross- linked polymers by living radical polymerisation. Borosilicate glass was modified with N,N-diethylaminodithiocarbamoylpropyl(trimethoxy) silane, in order to confine the iniferter reactive groups solely at its surface, then placed in solution with monomers and cross-linker. The polymerisation was initiated by UV irradiation. Formation of the cross-linked polymers was studied in terms of time course of the reaction, type of monomers incorporated and influence of oxygen. Grafted surfaces were characterised by AFM, FT-IR, ellipsometry and contact angle measurements. The ability to control the grafted layer improved dramatically when the chain terminator agent, N,N-N′,N′-tetraethyl <b>thiuram</b> <b>disulphide</b> (TED) was added. Upon irradiation TED increases the concentration of passive capping radicals and decreases the possibility of recombination of active macro-radicals, thus prolonging their lifetime. In the absence of TED the thickness of produced coatings was below 10 nm. TED added at different concentrations assisted in the formation of grafted layers of 10 – 130 nm thickness. Iniferter chemistry in the presence of TED can be used for growing nanometre-scale polymer layers on solid supports. It constitutes a robust general platform for controlled grafting and offer a general solution {{to address the needs of}} surface derivatisation in sensors...|$|E
