5|$|Closed circuit rebreathers {{are usually}} {{controlled}} {{to provide a}} fairly constant partial pressure of oxygen during the dive (set point), and may be reset to a richer mix for decompression. The effect {{is to keep the}} partial pressure of inert gases as low as safely practicable throughout the dive. This minimizes the absorption of inert gas in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> accelerates the elimination of the inert gases during ascent.|$|E

Vegeta outmatched Frieza showing the flaw of his new form where his body hasn't been used to the energy that gets consumed. Out of desperation, Frieza had destroyed Earth but with Whis' do over ability, Goku was able to prevent Frieza from destroying the Earth after being too over confident against him in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place</b> <b>and</b> destroys him once more.|$|E
5|$|The 1174 peace did {{not deal}} with the long-running {{tensions}} between Henry and Louis, however, and these resurfaced during the late 1170s. The two kings now began to compete for control of Berry, a prosperous region of value to both kings. Henry had some rights to western Berry, but in 1176 announced an extraordinary claim that he had agreed in 1169 to give Richard's fiancée Alice the whole province {{as part of the}} marriage settlement. If Louis accepted this, it would have implied that the Berry was Henry's to give away in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> would have given Henry the right to occupy it on Richard's behalf. To put additional pressure on Louis, Henry mobilised his armies for war. The papacy intervened and, probably as Henry had planned, the two kings were encouraged to sign a non-aggression treaty in September 1177, under which they promised to undertake a joint crusade. The ownership of the Auvergne and parts of the Berry were put to an arbitration panel, which reported in favour of Henry; Henry followed up this success by purchasing La Marche from the local count. This expansion of Henry's empire once again threatened French security and promptly put the new peace at risk.|$|E

25|$|Smaller {{parrotfish}} {{are relatively}} defenceless herbivores, poorly defended against predators like barracuda. They {{have evolved to}} find protection by schooling, sometimes with other species like shoaling rabbitfish. Spinefoot rabbitfish are named for their defensive venomous spines, and they are seldom attacked by predators. Spines are a last-ditch defence. It is better to avoid predator detection in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> avoid being thrust into risky spine-to-fang battles. So rabbitfish have also evolved skilful colour changing abilities.|$|E

25|$|Various {{schools of}} thought have emerged {{surrounding}} several key questions surrounding the Cultural Revolution, seeking to explain why events unfolded the way they did, why it began in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> <b>and</b> what it was. The movement's complexities contain many contradictions: led by an all-powerful omnipresent leader, it was mainly driven to fruition {{by a series of}} grassroots-led popular uprisings against the Communist establishment. While Mao's leadership was pivotal {{at the beginning of the}} movement, Jin Qiu contends that as events progressed it deviated significantly from Mao's utopian vision. In this sense, the Cultural Revolution was actually a much more decentralized and varied movement that gradually lost cohesion, spawning a large number of 'local revolutions' which differed in their nature and goals.|$|E
