In addition, evidence of sophisticated tool manufacture and {{use in the}} wild was reported from a population of orangutans in Suaq Balimbing (Pongo abelii) in 1996. These orangutans developed a tool kit for use in foraging that consisted of both insect-extraction <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> use in the hollows of trees and seed-extraction <b>tools</b> <b>for</b> harvesting seeds from hard-husked fruit. The orangutans adjusted their tools according {{to the nature of}} the task at hand, and preference was given to oral tool use.
