5|$|After Henry's death, the Welsh {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the Norman lords who {{had been}} extending their control into Wales during Henry's reign. Pain was with King Stephen at the siege of Exeter from June to August 1136, early in the king's reign. Crouch argues that Stephen did not at that time trust Pain, and kept him at the siege to more easily monitor his actions, and {{to prevent him from}} defecting to Matilda's cause.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} boom had ended, {{explicitly}} anti-foreign and racist attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> foreigners—not just Native Americans—from the mines, especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora, Mexico and Chile. The {{toll on the}} American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and crime rates during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high, and the resulting vigilantism also took its toll.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{rush hour}} traffic, {{thousands}} of residents in Oklahoma City attempted to outrun the storm by {{taking to the}} roads in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> of the tornado's projected path. By attempting to escape the storm by vehicle, in direct contrast to the recommended plan of action, residents put themselves at great risk from the storm; had the tornado maintained itself and passed over the congested freeways, more than 500 lives could have been lost.|$|E

5|$|In October 1947, {{following}} an offensive by the Pakistani raiders in Jammu and Kashmir, the Defence Committee of the Indian Cabinet directed the Army Headquarters {{to undertake a}} military response. The Army planned several operations <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the raiders as directed. In one such operation, the 50th Para Brigade, to which the Rajput Regiment was attached, was ordered to secure Naushahra and establish a base at Jhangar in mid-November.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, as the Fatimids regrouped, the Kalb {{had been}} {{repelled}} from Damascus, and in 1028, their emir died. He {{was replaced by}} his nephew, Rafi ibn Abi'l Layl, who defected to the Fatimids, thus weakening the tripartite Bedouin alliance. In November 1028, Anushtakin returned to Palestine with a large Fatimid army and additional horsemen from the Kalb and Banu Fazara <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the Tayy, and also to evict the Mirdasids from central Syria.|$|E
5|$|Violence in Kentucky {{increased}} with {{the outbreak of}} the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Native Americans who were unhappy about the loss of Kentucky in treaties saw the war as a chance <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the colonists. Isolated settlers and hunters became the frequent target of attacks, convincing many to abandon Kentucky. By late spring of 1776, fewer than 200 colonists remained in Kentucky, primarily at the fortified settlements of Boonesborough, Harrodsburg, and Logan's Station.|$|E

5|$|Hindman's edicts, however, {{raised the}} ire of the local citizenry, and his {{political}} enemies demanded that the Confederate leaders in Richmond replace him. By August 1862, the authorities in Richmond decided to replace him with the well-meaning but incompetent Theophilus H. Holmes. Hindman convinced Holmes {{to give him a}} field command in northern Arkansas, and he proceeded with a plan <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the invader. Hindman aggressively moved into northwest Arkansas and managed to intercept the Federal army while it was divided into two parts. At this moment, however, Hindman's normally aggressive style gave way to uncharacteristic doubt. Rather than attack the divided pieces of the Federal army, Hindman entrenched himself at Prairie Grove, Arkansas, allowing the Federal forces to recombine and assault him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} week of August 1944, the Second Panzer Army was finally ready to move to thwart the Partisan advance from Bosnia into Serbia, {{originally}} planned as Operation Rose. Renamed Operation Rübezahl (Mountain Spirit), the revamped plan required the 7th and 13th SS Divisions to form the Bosnian phase of the operation, named Operation Hackfleisch (Minced Meat). Hackfleisch aimed <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the Partisans occupying the area between the towns of Kladanj, Vlasenica, Sokolac and Olovo, south of the security zone. The overall plan involved columns that were to force the Partisans eastwards into the pincers of the other units, thereby destroying them.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October, the JNA {{mounted a}} major attack against Borovo Naselje. It made some progress, but became {{bogged down in}} the face of {{determined}} Croatian resistance. On 30 October, the JNA launched a fully coordinated assault, spearheaded by paramilitary forces, with infantry and engineering troops systematically forcing their way past the Croatian lines. The JNA's forces, divided into northern and southern operations sectors, attacked several points simultaneously and pushed the Croatians back. The JNA also adopted new tactics, such as firing directly into houses and then driving tanks through them, as well as using tear gas and smoke bombs <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> those inside. Buildings were also captured with the use of anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns.|$|E

5|$|Outside the pays d'en haut, most warriors of the {{influential}} Iroquois Confederacy {{did not participate}} in Pontiac's War because of their alliance with the British, known as the Covenant Chain. However, the westernmost Iroquois nation, the Seneca tribe, had become disaffected with the alliance. As early as 1761, the Seneca began to send out war messages to the Great Lakes and Ohio Country tribes, urging them to unite in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the British. When the war finally came in 1763, many Seneca were quick to take action.|$|E
5|$|Ten years later, Batman confronts a {{group of}} Gotham City crime bosses led by Chuckie Sol, who are {{intending}} to launder millions of counterfeit dollars in a casino. As Sol escapes to his car, a cloaked figure attacks him; Sol is killed when the figure causes him <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> {{the side of a}} parking garage and into a neighboring building. Batman arrives soon after, and bystanders blame him for Sol's death. Councilman Arthur Reeves tells the media that Batman is a menace (despite Commissioner Gordon's protests). Attending a party at Wayne Manor, Reeves teases Bruce for allowing Andrea to leave him.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Borgerhout was {{a battle}} during the Eighty Years' War, of the Spanish Army of Flanders led by Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma, upon a {{fortified}} camp {{at the village}} of Borgerhout, near Antwerp, where several thousand French, English, Scottish and Walloon soldiers in service of the recently created Union of Utrecht were stationed. It {{took place during the}} reconquest by the armies of Philip II of Spain of the Burgundian Netherlands, whose different provinces had united in 1576 under the Pacification of Ghent <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the foreign troops out and to grant religious liberty to Protestants.|$|E

5|$|The French and British ambassadors had set {{themselves}} up at Poros and invited Constantinople {{to send a}} diplomat there so as to pursue negotiations over the status of Greece. The Porte persisted in refusing to participate in conferences. Hence, the French suggested continuing military operations and extending them into Attica and Euboea. The British opposed this plan. Thus {{it was left to}} the Greeks <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the Ottomans from these territories, with the understanding that the French army would only intervene if the Greeks found themselves in trouble.|$|E
5|$|The Hananu Revolt (also {{known as}} the Aleppo Revolt or the Northern revolts) {{occurred}} in 1920–1921 in the western countryside of Aleppo and its purpose was <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> French military forces from northern Syria. Support for the revolt was driven by opposition {{to the establishment of}} a French Mandate in the country. The revolt was named after its leading commander, Ibrahim Hananu, and mainly consisted of four allied revolts in the areas of Jabal Harim, Jabal Qusayr, Jabal Zawiya and Jabal Sahyun. The rebels were led by rural leaders and mostly engaged in guerrilla attacks against French forces or the sabotage of key infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|The Hussite Wars, {{also known}} as the Hussite Crusade, {{involved}} military action against the Bohemian Reformation in the Kingdom of Bohemia and the followers of early Czech church reformer Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415. Crusades were declared five times during that period: in 1420, 1421, 1422, 1427, and 1431. These expeditions forced the Hussite forces, who disagreed on many doctrinal points, to unite <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the invaders. The wars ended in 1436 with the ratification of the compromise Compacts of Basel by the Church and the Hussites.|$|E

5|$|Hastings {{took part}} in the Second Anglo-Boer War in South Africa, serving with British troops despite his New Zealand roots. He enlisted into 34 Company Army Service Corps on 10 August 1900. Holding the rank of conductor, he {{remained}} with the company until 19 February 1901 when he was transferred at his own request to a mounted unit, Rimington's Scouts and Guides. Shortly before Hastings had arrived, Major Frederick Damant had taken over command of the unit and it later became known as Damant's Horse. Working with Major General (later General) Bruce Hamilton's 21st Brigade in Cape Colony <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> Boer forces led by Christiaan de Wet, Hastings gained the rank of sergeant and was wounded in action twice while serving with the unit. For a six-month period, he was detached from Damant's Horse, serving in Hamilton's field intelligence unit, during which time he commanded a group of native scouts.|$|E
5|$|He {{launched}} three subsequent attacks—Operations , Easy and Bison—to {{capture the}} Naushera, Jhangar, Poonch, Zoji La, Dras, and Kargil areas. Plans were laid <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the Pakistani forces from Kashmir completely, {{but they were}} stopped by {{the intervention of the}} United States. On 6 July 1948, the Army HQ issued strict instructions against conducting any major operations without its permission. Cariappa protested against this, stating that this policy would threaten Leh, Kargil, and ultimately the Kashmir Valley, which would put the country's security at stake. Though Cariappa asked for two brigades to continue offensive strikes, he was provided only one and permitted to advance to Kargil. He disobeyed orders and launched strikes in the Ladakh area allowing India to assert control over the region. Cariappa continued several operations and offensive strikes against the Pakistanis which involved high risk. Failure of any of them might have threatened the Indian forces. He was subsequently appointed to the supreme post of commander-in-chief.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), an Islamist organization, assumed {{control of}} much of the {{southern}} part of the country and promptly imposed Shari'a law. The new Transitional Federal Government (TFG), established two years earlier, sought to re-establish its authority. With the assistance of Ethiopian troops, AMISOM peacekeepers and air support by the United States, it managed <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>out</b> the rival ICU and solidify its rule. On 8 January 2007, as the Battle of Ras Kamboni raged, TFG President and founder Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, a former colonel in the Somali Army, entered Mogadishu for the first time since being elected to office. The government then relocated to Villa Somalia in Mogadishu from its interim location in Baidoa, marking the first time since the fall of the Barre regime in 1991 that the federal government controlled most of the country.|$|E
