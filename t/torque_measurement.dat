A systematic shift of the scaling function with increasing effective mass anisotropy γ = (m_ab*/m_c*) ^ 1 / 2 is observed, which may be understood in terms of a 3 D- 2 D crossover. Further evidence for a 3 D- 2 D crossover is found from temperature-dependent <b>torque</b> <b>measurements</b> carried out in different magnetic fields at different field orientations δ, which show a quasi 2 D "crossing region" (M*,T*). The occurrence of this "crossing phenomenon" is explained in a phenomenological way from the weak z dependence of the scaling function around a value z = z*. The "crossing" temperature T* is found to be angular-dependent. <b>Torque</b> <b>measurements</b> above T_c reveal that fluctuations are strongly enhanced in the underdoped regime where the anisotropy is large, whereas they are less important in the overdoped regime.

Maximum plantar flexion <b>torque</b> <b>measurements</b> were taken on one subject at six knee angles spanning full flexion to full extension. A planar three-segment (foot, shank and thigh), two muscle (soleus and gastrocnemius) model of plantar flexion was developed. Seven parameters per muscle were determined by minimizing a weighted root mean square difference (wRMSD) between the model output and the experimental torque data. Valid individual muscle models were obtained using experimental data from only two knee angles giving a wRMSD score of 16 N m, with values ranging from 11 to 17 N m {{for each of the}} six knee angles. The robustness of the methodology was confirmed through repeating the optimization with perturbed experimental torques (± 20 %) and segment lengths (± 10 %) resulting in wRMSD scores of between 13 and 20 N m. Hence, good representations of maximum torque can be achieved from subject-specific individual muscle models determined from single joint maximum <b>torque</b> <b>measurements.</b> The proposed methodology could be applied to muscle-driven models of human movement with the potential to improve their validity...|$|R

Haptics, {{as well as}} force and <b>torque</b> <b>measurements,</b> are {{increasingly}} gaining attention {{in the fields of}} kinesthetic learning and robot Learning from demonstration (LfD). For such learning techniques, it is essential to obtain accurate force and <b>torque</b> <b>measurements</b> in order to enable accurate control. However, force and <b>torque</b> <b>measurements</b> using a 6 -axis force and torque sensor mounted at the end effector of an industrial robot are known to be corrupted due to the robots internal forces, gravity, un-modelled dynamics and nonlinear effects. This paper presents an evaluation of two techniques, SVR and Random Forests, to recover the external forces and accurately selected possible contact situations by estimating a robots internal forces. The performance of the learned models have been evaluated using different performance metrics and comparing them with respect to the features contained in the input space. Both SVR and Random Forests require low computational complexity without intensive training over the operational space under the given ssumptions. In addition, these methods do not need data to be available online. The SVR and Random Forests models are experimentally validated using Motoman SDA 10 D dual-arm industrial robot controlled by Robot Operating System (ROS).

50|$|In most cases, {{motoring}} dynamometers are symmetrical; a 300 kW AC dynamometer {{can absorb}} 300 kW {{as well as}} motor at 300 kW. This is an uncommon requirement in engine testing and development. Sometimes, a more cost-effective solution is to attach a larger absorption dynamometer with a smaller motoring dynamometer. Alternatively, a larger absorption dynamometer and a simple AC or DC motor {{may be used in}} a similar manner, with the electric motor only providing motoring power when required (and no absorption). The (cheaper) absorption dynamometer is sized for the maximum required absorption, whereas the motoring dynamometer is sized for motoring. A typical size ratio for common emission test cycles and most engine development is approximately 3:1. <b>Torque</b> <b>measurement</b> is somewhat complicated since there are two machines in tandem - an inline torque transducer is the preferred method of <b>torque</b> <b>measurement</b> in this case. An eddy-current or waterbrake dynamometer, with electronic control combined with a variable frequency drive and AC induction motor, is a commonly used configuration of this type. Disadvantages include requiring a second set of test cell services (electrical power and cooling), and a slightly more complicated control system. Attention must be paid to the transition between motoring and braking in terms of control stability.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic torque {{magnetometry}} can be {{even more}} sensitive than SQUID magnetometry. However, magnetic torque magnetometry doesn’t measure magnetism directly as all the previously mentioned methods do. Magnetic torque magnetometry instead measures the torque τ acting on a sample’s magnetic moment μ {{as a result of}} a uniform magnetic field B, τ=μ×B.A torque is thus a measure of the sample's magnetic or shape anisotropy. In some cases the sample's magnetization can be extracted from the measured torque. In other cases, the magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>measurement</b> is used to detect magnetic phase transitions or quantum oscillations. The most common way to measure magnetic torque is to mount the sample on a cantilever and measure the displacement via capacitance measurement between the cantilever and nearby fixed object, or by measuring the piezoelectricity of the cantilever, or by optical interferometry off the surface of the cantilever.|$|E

The hollow internal cylinder - shaped as a conical rotor - is centered within the sample by hydrodynamic lubrication effects and centrifugal forces.

5000|$|<b>Torque</b> <b>measurement</b> is {{conducted}} {{in the same way}} as with an electronic torque wrench but the tightening angle from the snug point or threshold is also measured. The angle is measured by an angle sensor or electronic gyroscope. The angle measurement process enables joints which have already been tightened to be recognised. The inbuilt readings memory enables measurements to be statistically evaluated. Tightening curves can be analysed using the software via the integrated tightening-curve system (force/path graph). This type of torque wrench can also be used to determine breakaway torque, prevail torque and the final torque of a tightening job. Thanks to a special measuring process, it is also possible to display the yield point (yield controlled tightening). This design of torque wrench is highly popular with automotive manufacturers for documenting tightening processes requiring both torque and angle control because, in these cases, a defined angle has to be applied to the fastener on top of the prescribed torque (e.g. [...] + 90° - here the [...] means the snug point/threshold and +90° indicates that an additional angle has to be applied after the threshold).

Eccentric, isometric, and concentric peak torque of the trunk flexor and extensor muscles was measured in 15 healthy subjects. Muscle cross sectional area (CSA) and surface electromyographic (EMG) activity were respectively correlated to peak torque and submaximal isometric torque for erector spinae and rectus abdominis muscles. Reliability of peak <b>torque</b> <b>measurements</b> was determined during test and retest sessions. Significant correlations were consistently observed between muscle CSA and peak torque for all contraction types (r = 0. 74 À 0. 85; P < 0. 001) and between EMG activity and submaximal isometric torque (r P 0. 99; P < 0. 05), for both extensor and flexor muscles. Intraclass correlation coefficients were comprised between 0. 87 and 0. 95, and standard errors of measurement were lower than 9 % for all contraction modes. The mean difference in peak torque between test and retest ranged from À 3. 7 % to 3. 7 % with no significant mean directional bias. Overall, our findings establish the validity of <b>torque</b> <b>measurements</b> using the tested trunk module. Also considering the excellent test–retest reliability of peak <b>torque</b> <b>measurements,</b> we conclude that this latest-generation isokinetic dynamometer could be used with confidence to evaluate trunk muscle function for clinical or athletic purposes...|$|R
