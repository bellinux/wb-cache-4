50|$|Recognizing {{that the}} {{proliferation}} of area codes was {{largely due to the}} telecom regulation act and the assignment of numbers in blocks of 10,000, the FCC instructed NANPA, by then administered by Neustar, to alleviate the numbering shortage. As a result, number pooling was piloted in 2001 as a system for allocating local numbers to carriers in blocks of 1,000 rather than 10,000. Because of the then design of the switched telephone network, this was a considerable <b>technical</b> <b>obstacle.</b> Number pooling was implemented with another <b>technical</b> <b>obstacle,</b> local number portability.|$|E
