5|$|The REVA NXR {{exhibited}} in the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show and the Nissan Leaf SV trim both have roof-mounted solar panels. These solar panels are designed to <b>trickle</b> <b>charge</b> the batteries when the car is moving or parked. Another proposed technology is REVive, by Reva. When the REVA NXR's batteries are running low or are fully depleted, the driver is able to send an SMS to REVive and unlock a hidden reserve in the battery pack. Reva has not provided details on how the system will work. The Fisker Karma uses solar panel in the roof to recharge the 12-volt lead-acid accessory battery. The Nissan Leaf SL trim also has a small solar panel {{at the rear of}} the roof/spoiler that can <b>trickle</b> <b>charge</b> the auxiliary 12-volt lead-acid battery.|$|E
2500|$|The Nissan Leaf employs an {{advanced}} telematics system called CarWings which originally was only available in Japan. The system sends and receives data via a built-in GPRS radio {{similar to the}} connectivity of mobile phones. [...] Carwings is connected any time the car is in range of a cell tower and it makes possible several user functionalities, such as position and possible range on a map and which charging stations are available within range. The system also tracks and compiles statistics about distance traveled and energy consumption and produces daily, monthly and annual reports of these and several other operational parameters. All information {{is available in the}} Leaf's digital screens. [...] Through a smart phone application or secure web page, owners can remotely turn on the air-conditioner or heater as well as reset charging functions even when the vehicle is powered down. This remote functionality can be used to pre-heat or pre-cool the car prior to use while it is still charging so that less energy from the battery is used for climate control. [...] An on-board timer can also be pre-programmed to recharge batteries at a set time such as during off-peak rates. The Leaf's SL trim has a small solar panel {{at the rear of the}} roof/spoiler that can <b>trickle</b> <b>charge</b> the auxiliary battery.|$|E
50|$|The solar arrays {{photovoltaic}} produce 800 volts DC, {{which is}} inverted to 230 volts AC and fed to the grid. Power can be inverted again to 48 volts DC to <b>trickle</b> <b>charge</b> the batteries. The system is completed {{with a small}} diesel generator that starts automatically.|$|E
50|$|A <b>trickle</b> <b>charger</b> is {{typically}} a low-current (5-1,500 mA) battery <b>charger.</b> A <b>trickle</b> <b>charger</b> is generally used to charge small capacity batteries (2-30 Ah). These types of battery chargers {{are also used}} to maintain larger capacity batteries (> 30 Ah) that are typically found on cars, boats, RVs and other related vehicles. In larger applications, the current of the battery charger is sufficient only to provide a maintenance or trickle current (trickle is commonly the last charging stage of most battery chargers). Depending on the technology of the <b>trickle</b> <b>charger,</b> it can be left connected to the battery indefinitely. Some battery chargers that can be left connected to the battery without causing the battery damage are {{also referred to as}} smart or intelligent chargers. Note that not all battery types can tolerate <b>trickle</b> <b>charging</b> after being fully charged; most Li-ion batteries are damaged by <b>trickle</b> <b>charging.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to chip cooling, thermal bumps {{can also be}} applied to high heat-flux interconnects to provide a constant, steady source of power for energy scavenging applications. Such a source of power, typically in the mW range, can <b>trickle</b> <b>charge</b> batteries for wireless sensor networks and other battery operated systems.|$|E
50|$|The manual {{does not}} {{indicate}} that removing the charging plug before it is fully charged can illuminate the 'Electrical Fault Light' which stays on until a full <b>trickle</b> <b>charge</b> is performed. This can be quite disconcerting as the manual states the car {{has to be taken}} to the dealer to reset the problem. Also, one cannot, or should not, perform a fast charge when it is in this state.|$|E
50|$|A typical {{intelligent}} charger fast-charges a battery {{up to about}} 85% of its maximum capacity {{in less than an}} hour, then switches to <b>trickle</b> <b>charging,</b> which takes several hours to top off the battery to its full capacity.|$|R
50|$|Monolog {{is powered}} via four AA {{rechargeable}} batteries which are <b>trickle</b> <b>charged</b> at approximately 2 mA from a control line. This control line {{is also used}} for remote connection to the unit {{for the purposes of}} data retrieval.|$|R
50|$|Some {{chargers}} use pulses {{to check}} the current battery state when the charger is first connected, then use constant current charging during fast charging, then use pulse charging {{as a kind of}} <b>trickle</b> <b>charging</b> to maintain the charge.|$|R
5000|$|Known {{charging}} regimes {{include a}} constant current of C or C/2 to cell voltage = 1.9 V. Maximum charge time is given variously as [...] hours and 3 hours. Once charged, continuous trickle charging is not recommended, as recombination is not provided for, and excess hydrogen will eventually vent, adversely affecting battery cycle life. A typical charger for NiZn batteries specifically does not <b>trickle</b> <b>charge</b> after the battery is fully charged, but shuts off.|$|E
50|$|For {{lead-acid}} batteries under no-load {{float charging}} (such as in SLI batteries), trickle charging is achieved naturally at the end-of-charge, when the lead-acid battery takes in a <b>trickle</b> <b>charge</b> to keep itself fully charged. The trickle charging then equals the energy expended by the lead-acid battery in splitting {{the water in}} the electrolyte into hydrogen and oxygen gases. Other technologies, such as the lithium-ion battery technology, are highly intolerant to over-charging, and cannot be float-charged without an external battery management system.|$|E
50|$|Another {{option is}} to monitor the change of voltage with respect to time and stop when this becomes zero, but this risks {{premature}} cutoffs. With this method, a much higher charging rate can be used than with a <b>trickle</b> <b>charge,</b> up to 1 C. At this charge rate, Panasonic recommends to terminate charging when the voltage drops 5-10 mV per cell from the peak voltage. Since this method measures the voltage across the battery, a constant-current (rather than a constant-voltage) charging circuit is used.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{nickel-zinc battery}} {{systems have been}} known for over 100 years. Since 2000, {{development}} of a stabilized zinc electrode system has made this technology viable and competitive with other commercially available rechargeable battery systems. Unlike some other technologies, <b>trickle</b> <b>charging</b> is not recommended.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trickle</b> <b>{{charging}}</b> means {{charging a}} {{fully charged battery}} under no-load at a rate equal to its self-discharge rate, thus enabling the battery to remain at its fully charged level. A battery under continuous float voltage charging {{is said to be}} under float-charging.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the size}} of the battery, the desulfation process can take from 48h to weeks to complete. During this period the battery is also <b>trickle</b> <b>charged</b> to {{continue}} reducing the amount of lead sulfur in solution. Commercial regenerators often support multiple batteries to provide parallel operation to improve throughput.|$|R
50|$|Electrics : Magneto {{ignition}} with integral 6V AC for {{the main}} running lights (including high and low beam on a switch). The indicators, brake lights, neutral light and horn ran separately on 6 v DC from a three-cell lead acid battery that received a <b>trickle</b> <b>charge</b> from the magneto. On most models the three position ignition switch (on a key providing off, run and lights) was mounted on the L/H side panel, however the switch {{was moved to the}} conventional position between the handlebars on the FS1-E DX (front disc brake equipped model) and later FS1-E models.|$|E
50|$|When {{not under}} load or charge, a Ni-Cd battery will {{self-discharge}} approximately 10% per month at 20 Â°C, ranging up to 20% per month at higher temperatures. It {{is possible to}} perform a <b>trickle</b> <b>charge</b> at current levels just high enough to offset this discharge rate; to keep a battery fully charged. However, if the battery {{is going to be}} stored unused {{for a long period of}} time, it should be discharged down to at most 40% of capacity (some manufacturers recommend fully discharging and even short-circuiting once fully discharged), and stored in a cool, dry environment.|$|E
50|$|Duracell further {{suggests}} that a <b>trickle</b> <b>charge</b> at C/300 {{can be used for}} batteries that must be kept in a fully charged state. Some chargers do this after the charge cycle, to offset natural self-discharge. A similar approach is suggested by Energizer, which indicates that self-catalysis can recombine gas formed at the electrodes for charge rates up to C/10. This leads to cell heating. The company recommends C/30 or C/40 for indefinite applications where long life is important. This is the approach taken in emergency lighting applications, where the design remains essentially the same as in older NiCd units, except for an increase in the trickle-charging resistor value.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a taper cum <b>trickle</b> <b>charger</b> which {{automatically}} adjusts the charging current proportional to the AH of discharge of the battery. The unique feature of the charger is that the SCR is phase controlled and, unlike other chargers using UJT and SCR, {{this is not an}} ON-OFF charger but a proportional charger. Refs...|$|R

The Daymak Beast is {{an electric}} all-terrain scooter {{that has a}} solar panel battery pack that <b>trickle</b> <b>charges</b> as it sits outside in the sun. The Daymak Beast was successfully funded on July 30, 2014, raising $136,378 CAD. Since then the Beast has come out with an off-road model the Beast D, which has dual 500W motors.|$|R
40|$|Proof of concept {{testing has}} been {{performed}} on a 'powerstick' <b>trickle</b> <b>charger,</b> which uses heat from a radioisotope heater unit to charge spacecraft batteries.

50|$|The Farm {{installed}} its own {{water system}} and water towers. Some individuals initially resisted running electricity and power lines beyond the administration office and publishing center, {{with the hope}} of establishing off-grid decentralized utilities instead. The electrical supply 120/240 VAC mains system evolved from supplying only a few industrial buildings near the main Farm Road in 1971 to the point by the 1980s where most areas were covered either by 12 Volt automotive battery <b>trickle</b> <b>charge</b> systems. Most homes phased out the use of kerosene lamps by 1975, as they converted to 12 Volt lighting and RV appliances or re-purposed automotive lighting fixtures. Off-grid low voltage 12 Volt DC systems were also sometimes powered by swapping vehicle batteries. After the economic change in 1983, all home were connected to the standard electrical grid.|$|E
50|$|Walter tears {{down the}} {{portable}} generator {{to allow him}} to try to <b>trickle</b> <b>charge</b> the Winnebago's battery by turning the generator's crank. Though this briefly enables the engine to turn over, the battery quickly dies. Walt becomes depressed and starts suffering from heat exhaustion. Jesse realizes that Walt believes he is going to die, evidenced later when Walter coughs up blood. Walt believes he deserves to die as he has constantly lied to his family. Jesse tries to cheer Walt from his slump, and this inspires Walt to construct their own battery from the materials they have on hand. The make-shift battery provides enough power to jump-start the Winnebago, and they are able to return to Albuquerque. Jesse drops Walt at the airport, assuring him that if he dies, his family will get the share of the money.|$|E

50|$|A <b>trickle</b> <b>charger</b> {{provides}} {{a relatively small}} amount of current, only enough to counteract self-discharge of a battery that is idle for a long time. Slow battery chargers may take several hours to complete a charge; high-rate chargers may restore most capacity much faster, but high rate chargers can be more than some battery types can tolerate. Such batteries require active monitoring of the battery {{to protect it from}} overcharge. Electric vehicles ideally need high-rate chargers; for public access, installation of such chargers and the distribution support for them is an issue in the proposed adoption of electric cars.|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is described which predicts the service life of nickel-cadmium batteries designed for geosynchronous orbit satellites.

Based on the test results, the following recommendations were made: (1) If the user's purpose will allow a rejuvenation cycle or two after a long storage period, the open circuit regime will likely give slightly greater capacity. (2) If the user's purpose demands immediately available power following a long storage period, the <b>trickle</b> <b>charge</b> method of storage is definitely the regime to use...|$|E

50|$|The DynaTAC 8 Series, Classic, Classic II, Ultra Classic, and Ultra Classic II had {{a display}} with red LEDs; the DynaTAC International Series with green LEDs, and the DynaTAC 6000XL used a vacuum {{fluorescent}} display.

50|$|Since the Universal Serial Bus {{specification}} {{provides for}} a five-volt power supply, {{it is possible to}} use a USB cable to connect a device to a power supply.

They may be fully compliant USB peripheral devices adhering to USB power discipline, or uncontrolled in the manner of USB decorations.Although portable solar chargers obtain energy from the sun only, they still can (depending on the technology) be used in low light (i.e. cloudy) applications. Portable solar chargers are typically used for <b>trickle</b> <b>charging,</b> although some solar chargers (depending on the wattage), can completely recharge batteries. Other devices may exist, which combine this with other sources of energy for added recharging efficacy.|$|R
