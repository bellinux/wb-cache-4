5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words {{as a form of}} spin and propaganda, in order to act as if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E
6000|$|In {{an instant}} the whole hideous, {{incredible}} truth flashed wildly across my bewildered brain. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice Kea to this hateful god! <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fling {{her into the}} mouth of the crater! <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> offer her up in marriage to the son of Pélé! ...|$|R

5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to say that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E
5|$|Carly Beth Caldwell is a naive, timid and gullible 11-year-old {{girl who}} is afraid of pretty much everything. Thus, she is a {{constant}} target for pranks, jokes and tricks, most of them being inflicted on her by Steve Boswell and Chuck Greene at Walnut Avenue Middle School. In the opening chapter, Carly Beth and Sabrina discuss what costumes <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> wear for Halloween, and Carly Beth is tricked by Steve into eating a sandwich containing a live worm. Horrified, Carly Beth flees and vows revenge. After school, she goes home and finds her mother has made her a silly duck costume for Halloween, and also a very realistic plaster of Paris model of Carly Beth's head. When she goes to her room, the duck costume seemingly comes alive and attacks Carly Beth. It turns out it is her younger brother, Noah, playing another trick on her. Sabrina calls, and they discuss the school science fair.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kyle invites Stan, Cartman, and Kenny to {{his younger}} brother Ike's bris. When they learn more about what a bris is, and misconstrue it as a party where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> remove his penis, Kyle tries {{to find a way}} to hide his brother from his parents and the {{circumcision}} process. Kyle puts Ike on a train to Nebraska and makes an Ike-style doll out of meat bones in an attempt to not arouse his parents' suspicions. This backfires when the doll is eaten by a dog, which leads to them to think that Ike is dead. It is at the funeral that Kyle finds out that Ike is not his biological brother, but was adopted from Canada due to the tombstone featuring the Canadian flag. Upon discovering this, Kyle decides that Ike is no longer his brother. His parents are shocked after Kyle reveals the truth, and Ike is retrieved from Nebraska.|$|E
50|$|Triple Eight {{announced}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> run {{at least two}} cars in the 2011 Porsche Carrera Cup Great Britain and that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> enter the 2011 Ginetta GT Supercup season.

He plans {{to take her to}} a concert, but Lauren's father Max Branning (Jake Wood) uncovers her hidden clothes and refuses her permission to attend. When Whitney's sixteenth birthday arrives, she books flights so they can run away together. Attempting to foil her plan, Tony steals her passport but it is found and returned. On her birthday, Whitney tells Bianca about her relationship with Tony, believing that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> leave together. Horrified, Bianca calls the police, and Tony is arrested. He is later released on bail and visits their home in an attempt to convince Whitney not to give a statement to the police. He is attacked by Bianca's ex-husband Ricky (Sid Owen) and re-arrested for breaking his bail conditions.|$|E

Boogaloo sets up a rumble between his gang and the Stompers. Vinnie later meets up with Roz and the girl Crazy dates, Eva; Crazy has {{meanwhile}} beaten all the mobsters. The four head out to a party, where Vinnie tells the Stompers that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fight with the Chaplains, to which the gang responds negatively. Much of the gang and their girls head out to a rock and roll show. Vinnie is horrified {{at the idea of}} Crazy and himself having to fight the Chaplains alone. One of the Stompers named Sal and his girl have a run-in with Boogaloo while driving, and wind up in a car crash. Vinnie finally persuades the Stompers to rumble with the Chaplains.|$|E

25|$|Suddenly, {{they turned}} around, got on their knees, {{as if they}} were ordered to, they did it all together, aimed. And personally, I was {{standing}} there saying, they're not going to shoot, they can't do that. If <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> shoot, it's going to be blank.|$|E
25|$|An {{open draw}} {{for the first}} round took place on 24 June, after {{all but one of}} the {{participants}} were known. This made sure that some teams did not have the advantage of knowing who <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be playing against longer than others. The matches were scheduled to be played on the weekend of 7 July and 8.|$|E

25|$|Some {{producers}} also {{profit from}} the indirect benefits of fair trade practices. Fair trade cooperatives create a space of solidarity and promote an entrepreneurial spirit among growers. When growers {{feel like they have}} control over their own lives within the network of their cooperative, it can be very empowering. Operating a profitable business allows growers to think about their future, rather than worrying about how <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> survive in poverty.|$|E
25|$|Then Vice Principal Nero {{tells the}} {{children}} that if they keep failing their tests, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be tutored by Coach Genghis, and that Sunny will be fired. He says {{that they will have}} extra-hard comprehensive exams the next morning. He also demands that they give him nine bags of candy each (which he mistakenly counts as 29 bags of candy, instead of 27), as punishment for missing his concerts, and give Carmelita Spats earrings for each time she brought them a message.|$|E
25|$|I do support getting animals out in {{the same}} way I would have {{supported}} getting human slaves out, child labor, sex slaves, the whole lot. But I don't support burning. I don't support arson. I would rather that these buildings weren't standing, so on some level I understand. I just don't like the idea of that. Maybe that is wishy-washy of me, because I don't want those buildings standing if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hurt anyone. And the ALF has never hurt mice nor mare.|$|E

25|$|Specific trap {{sites for}} heavy mineral sand placer {{deposits}} are in beaches on the leeward side of headlands, as this forms a low-energy zone which traps sediments carried {{along by the}} longshore drift. Also, sand bars developed at the mouths of rivers which feed the placer deposits are rich trap sites where the winnowing action of the waves are most efficient, because heavy minerals, if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be too heavy to be moved, will deposit at an isthmus in preference to drifting too far down the beach.|$|E
25|$|What can {{be viewed}} as a success by those inside and outside the church from this focus is a higher level of {{cooperation}} and friendliness among churches and denominations. It is very common for those working on international fields to not only cooperate in efforts to share their gospel message, but view the work of their groups in a similar light. Also, with the increased study and awareness of different people groups, western mission efforts have become far more sensitive to the cultural nuances of those <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> and those they are working with in the effort.|$|E
25|$|In 1958 Japan, {{university}} professor Tatsuo Kusakabe {{and his two}} daughters, Satsuki and Mei, move into an old house {{to be closer to}} the hospital where the girls' mother, Yasuko, is recovering from a long-term illness. Satsuki and Mei find that the house is inhabited by tiny animated dust creatures called susuwatari –- small, dark, dust-like house spirits seen when moving from light to dark places. When the girls become comfortable in their new house and laugh with Tatsuo, the soot spirits leave the house to drift away on the wind. It is implied that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> find another empty house –- their natural habitat.|$|E
