5|$|Treloar {{continues}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> {{an important}} figure in Australian military history.

5|$|Although {{these issues}} with {{censorship}} obscured and truncated the film {{for many years}} following its release, the film was soon recognized by many western critics and film directors as a highly original and accomplished work. Even more since being restored to its original version, Andrei Rublev has come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the greatest}} films of all time, and has often been ranked highly in both the Sight & Sound critics' and directors' polls.|$|E
30|$|A Paired t-test <b>was</b> used <b>to</b> analyze {{differences}} in the VBD calculated from FFDM versus DBT. The correlation coefficient (R value) and its 95  % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for variables including the age and calculated VBD. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. R values from 0 <b>to</b> 0.25 <b>were</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> indicating {{the absence of a}} correlation. Those from 0.25 <b>to</b> 0.50 <b>were</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> indicating a poor correlation. Those from 0.50 <b>to</b> 0.75 <b>were</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> indicating a moderate to good correlation. Finally, R values from 0.75 <b>to</b> 1.0 <b>were</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> indicating a very good to excellent correlation between the variables (Dawson and Trapp 2004).|$|R

5|$|The {{raising of}} school leaving age (shortened to ROSLA) {{is the name}} given by the {{government}} to refer to changes regarding the legal age a child is permitted to leave compulsory education as specified under an Education Act. In most countries, the school leaving age often reflects when young people are seen to be mature enough within their society, but not necessarily when they are old enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> an adult.|$|E
5|$|According to an {{alternative}} theory, {{popular in the}} earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval cultures {{in the area of}} modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition of earlier indigenous populations, who then would need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity, during which settlements were absent or rare, and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Craig was a late auditionee for {{the role}} of Geordie. At the audition, he {{performed}} the Geordie accent very poorly, however, he won the part and it came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> his breakthrough role. Mark Strong worked on the Geordie accent by studying episodes of the 1980s comedy series Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, which featured lead characters from Newcastle. Strong later claimed that Christopher Eccleston took a dislike to him, and outside of their scenes together, the pair did not speak for the entire period that Our Friends in the North was filming.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s Vaughan Williams came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> {{a leading}} figure in British music, {{particularly}} after {{the deaths of}} Elgar, Delius and Holst in 1934. Holst's death was a severe personal and professional blow to Vaughan Williams; the two had been each other's closest friends and musical advisers since their college days. After Holst's death Vaughan Williams was glad of the advice and support of other friends including Boult and the composer Gerald Finzi, but his relationship with Holst was irreplaceable.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{following}} their repeated failures before Constantinople, {{and the continued}} resilience of the Byzantine state, the Muslims began to project the fall of Constantinople to the distant future. Thus the city's fall came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> one of {{the signs of the}} arrival of the end times in Islamic eschatology. The siege became a motif in Byzantine apocalyptic literature as well, with decisive final battles against the Arabs before the walls of Constantinople being featured in the early 8th-century Greek translation of the Syriac Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius and the Apocalypse of Daniel, written either at about the time of the siege or a century later.|$|E

5|$|In April 1883 Carvalho finally revived Carmen at the Opéra-Comique, with Adèle Isaac {{featuring}} in an under-rehearsed {{production that}} removed {{some of the}} controversial aspects of the original. Carvalho was roundly condemned by the critics for offering a travesty of what had come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a masterpiece of French opera; nevertheless, this version was acclaimed by the public and played to full houses. In October Carvalho yielded to pressure and revised the production; he brought back Galli-Marié, and restored the score and libretto to their 1875 forms.|$|E
5|$|In middle age, Walton left Britain {{and set up}} {{home with}} his young wife Susana on the Italian island of Ischia. By this time, he had ceased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a modernist, {{and some of his}} {{compositions}} of the 1950s were criticised as old-fashioned. His only full-length opera, Troilus and Cressida, was among the works to be so labelled and has made little impact in opera houses. In his last years, his works came back into critical fashion; his later compositions, dismissed by critics {{at the time of their}} premieres, were revalued and regarded alongside his earlier works.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the concentration of activity within the Dairi, the Greater Palace began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> increasingly unsafe, especially by night. One reason may be the prevalent superstition of the period: uninhabited buildings were avoided for fear of spirits and ghosts, and even the great Buraku-in compound {{was thought to be}} haunted. In addition, the level of actual security maintained at the palace went into decline, and by the early 11th century only one palace gate, the Yōmeimon in the east, appears to have been guarded. Hence burglary and even violent crime became a problem within the palace by the first half of 11th century.|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} these steps toward equal treatment, a legal flaw remained: if {{children}} were born within a lesbian marriage, the non-biological mother was not legally regarded as a parent; she still had to undergo the lengthy financial process of adoption. This right was granted to heterosexual couples (married or not), where a stepfather could declare his wife's children to be his without further process. On 7 November 2006, the Spanish Parliament amended the law on assisted reproduction, allowing the non-biological mother <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a parent alongside her female spouse who is the birth-mother.|$|E
5|$|Junkin played {{four years}} of college {{football}} at Duke University. In the 1987 NFL Draft, the Cleveland Browns traded up to select him with the fifth overall pick. He played in parts of two seasons for the Browns, both of which ended early due to injury. Junkin was then traded to the Kansas City Chiefs for a fifth-round selection and played in five more games. After his release from the Chiefs, he did not play another game in the NFL. His failure to establish himself in the NFL has caused him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a draft bust.|$|E
5|$|Kościuszko's {{force was}} {{assigned}} to protect the front's southern flank, touching up to the Austrian border. At the Battle of Dubienka (July 18, 1792) Kościuszko repulsed a numerically superior enemy, skilfully using terrain obstacles and field fortifications, and came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> one of Poland's most brilliant military commanders of the age. With some 5,300 men, he defeated 25,000 Russians led by General Michail Kachovski. Despite the tactical victory, Kościuszko had to retreat from Dubienka, as the Russians crossed the nearby Austrian border and began flanking his positions.|$|E

5|$|Nirvana was an American {{rock band}} formed by singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Nirvana {{went through a}} {{succession}} of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined in 1990. Despite releasing only three full-length studio albums in their seven-year career, Nirvana has come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> {{one of the most}} influential and important alternative bands in history. Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the death of Cobain, their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock and roll culture.|$|E

In 980, Dunstan joined Ælfhere of Mercia in the solemn {{translation}} of the relics of King Edward, soon <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a saint, from their grave at Wareham to a shrine at Shaftesbury Abbey. In 984, in obedience to a vision of St Andrew, he persuaded King Æthelred to appoint Ælfheah as Bishop of Winchester in succession to Æthelwold. In 986, Dunstan induced the king, by a donation of 100 pounds of silver, to stop his persecution of the See of Rochester.|$|E
