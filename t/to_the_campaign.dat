5|$|Both the McCain and Obama campaigns {{released}} light-hearted {{statements about}} the prank.

There, a large battle took place on 14 June, {{which resulted in the}} Austrian evacuation of Italy.|$|E
5|$|Her father's {{business}} and political contacts helped John McCain to gain a foothold in Arizona politics. She campaigned with her husband door to door during his successful first bid for U.S. Congress in 1982, and was heavily involved in campaign strategy. Her wealth from an expired trust from her parents provided significant loans <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> and helped it survive a period of early debt.|$|E
5|$|I {{believe in}} all sincerity {{that if you}} do not deflate the {{opposition}} candidate before your own campaign gets started, the odds are you are doomed to defeat. I believe it is a smear to attack an individual on matters that have no relationship whatsoever <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign...</b> {{but it is not a}} smear if you point out the record of your opponent.|$|E

5|$|Turmoil in the mayor's office also {{weakened}} the Birmingham city government in its opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> Connor, {{who had run}} for several elected offices {{in the months leading}} up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> had lost all but the race for Public Safety Commissioner. Because they believed Connor's extreme conservatism slowed progress for the city as a whole, a group of white political moderates worked to defeat him. The Citizens for Progress was backed by the Chamber of Commerce and other white professionals in the city, and their tactics were successful. In November 1962, Connor lost the race for mayor to Albert Boutwell, a less combative segregationist. However, Connor and his colleagues on the City Commission refused to accept the new mayor's authority. They claimed on a technicality that their terms would not expire until 1965 instead of in the spring of 1963. So for a brief time, Birmingham had two city governments attempting to conduct business.|$|E
5|$|Winner donated £500,000 of his {{own money}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> for a {{national}} memorial and the remainder of the total cost of £2.3 million was met by a public collection. After a ten-year campaign, Westminster City Council granted planning permission in October 2002.|$|E

5|$|Aiming {{to knock}} Turkey {{out of the}} war the British then decided to stage an amphibious {{lodgement}} at Gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British, Indian and French forces committed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC)—commanded by British general William Birdwood—subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915. Although promising to transform the war if successful, the Gallipoli Campaign was ill-conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate, without achieving its objectives. Australian casualties totalled 26,111, including 8,141 killed.|$|E
5|$|By late November 1810, the {{invasion}} force was assembled and Vice-Admiral Albemarle Bertie assumed command at Rodriguez. Upon consultation with his commanders, Bertie decided {{to land at}} Grand Baie {{to the north of}} the island's capital. The landing itself would be commanded by Captain Philip Beaver in HMS Nisus and the first troops ashore would be a specially selected vanguard under Keating and a naval brigade under Captain William Augustus Montagu. These forces would advance on Port Napoleon with subsequent reinforcement by the main force under General John Abercromby over the following days. This force, nearly 7,000 in number, was significantly larger than the reliable troops available to Decaen, which numbered approximately 1,300, and were intended to achieve a quick resolution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> before the hurricane season began in December.|$|E
5|$|Costa scored his tenth goal of {{the league}} season to give Chelsea a 2–1 win away to Liverpool on 8 November, {{preserving}} their unbeaten start <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> In January, Costa was charged by the FA {{in relation to a}} stamp on Emre Can during Chelsea's win over Liverpool in the League Cup semi-finals, and was given a three-match ban. Costa won his first trophy for Chelsea on 1 March, as they defeated Tottenham Hotspur 2–0 to win the League Cup at Wembley Stadium; he scored the second {{goal of the}} game.|$|E

5000|$|Much of <b>the</b> {{opposition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bush <b>campaign</b> (and vis-a-vis support <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kerry <b>campaign)</b> took <b>the</b> form of [...] "Anybody but Bush" [...] - {{voters who}} {{would vote for}} anyone else.|$|R
5|$|Furthermore, despite changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> finance laws, {{there was}} no {{perceptible}} decrease in campaigning activity. One reason was a compensatory expansion of advertising by way of internet search engines such as Facebook and other social media which were relatively inexpensive. Helsingin Sanomat called election workers in all electoral districts, excluding the Åland Islands, to ask for their assessments of the electoral campaigns. They reported that while the NCP's campaign was the most visible, the Centre Party and the Social Democrats also had high-profile campaigns with some variations across districts. The NCP were also said to be spending more {{of their own money}} than in the past.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Borah joined many Idahoans, {{including}} Senator Fred Dubois, in bolting the Republican Party {{to support}} the presidential campaign of Democrat William Jennings Bryan — free silver, which Bryan advocated, was extremely popular in Idaho. Borah thus became a Silver Republican in opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> of the Republican presidential candidate, former Ohio governor William McKinley. Borah ran for the House of Representatives that year, but knew that with the silver vote split between himself and a Democrat-Populist fusion candidate, he had little chance of winning, and concentrated on making speeches aimed at gaining a legislature that would re-elect Dubois — until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. Bryan, Dubois, and Borah were all defeated.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{an article}} written by Diana C. Mutz compares the {{politics}} of Harry Potter to the 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign. She states that 3 themes throughout the books are widely predominant '1) the value of tolerance and respect for difference; 2) opposition to violence and punitiveness; and 3) the dangers of authoritarianism.' She suggests that these themes are also present {{in the presidential election}} and it may {{play a significant role in}} how Americans have responded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b>|$|E

5|$|In July 2002 he {{appointed}} Alan Cork as his number two. Losing {{just one of}} their opening eleven games, his side made an excellent start <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> seeing Adams rewarded with the Manager of the Month award for September 2002. Despite Leicester going into receivership with debts of £30 million and being banned from the transfer market until a takeover was completed, Adams was able to guide them to promotion back to the Premiership at the first attempt—they ended the 2002–03 season as Division One runners-up behind champions Portsmouth. At {{the end of the}} campaign he signed a new three-year contract.|$|E
5|$|L. decemlineata is {{an iconic}} species {{and has been}} used as an image on stamps because of its {{association}} with the recent history of both North America and Europe. For example, in 1956, Romania issued a set of four stamps calling attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> against insect pests and it was featured on a 1967 stamp issued in Austria. The beetle also appeared on stamps issued in Benin, Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates, and Mozambique.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{analysts believe}} that the Italian {{campaign}} failed because Mussolini and his generals initially allocated insufficient resources <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> (an expeditionary force of 55,000 men), failed to reckon with the autumn weather, attacked without the advantage of surprise and without Bulgarian support. Elementary precautions such as issuing winter clothing had not been taken. Mussolini had not considered the warnings of the Italian Commission of War Production, that Italy {{would not be able}} to sustain a full year of continuous warfare until 1949.|$|E
