However, in some cases, mask application can cause pressure ulcers to specific features of the face, resulting in pain and reduced {{quality of life for}} the individual. This study investigated the effects of mask <b>strap</b> <b>tension</b> on the biomechanical and biomarker responses at the skin interface. Healthy participants (n= 13) were recruited and assigned two different masks in a random order, which were fitted with three strap conditions representing increments of 5  mm to increase tension. Masks were worn for 10  minutes at each tension followed by a 10 -minute refractory period. Assessment at the device–skin interface included measurements of pressures at the nose and cheeks, temperature and humidity, a selection of inflammatory cytokine concentrations collected from sebum and scores of comfort. The results indicated significantly higher interface pressures at the bridge of the nose compared to the cheeks for both masks (p< 0. 05), with nasal interface pressures significantly increasing with elevated <b>strap</b> <b>tension</b> (p< 0. 05). One inflammatory cytokine, IL- 1 α, increased following mask application at the highest tension, with median increases from baselines ranging from 21 to 33 %. The other cytokines revealed a less consistent trend with <b>strap</b> <b>tension.</b> The participants reported statistically greater discomfort during elevated <b>strap</b> <b>tension.</b> Temperature and humidity values under the mask were elevated from ambient conditions, although no differences were observed between mask type or <b>strap</b> <b>tension.</b> The bony prominence on the bridge of the nose represented a vulnerable area of skin during respiratory mask application.

40|$|To {{manufacture}} advanced fibre placement (AFP) structures {{according to}} the results of conceptual design and optimisation, several manufacturing constraints must be considered. As a result, the computationally optimised solution often cannot be perfectly achieved within the manufacturing process. Instead, a producible fibre alignment is realised, which may include local fibre particularities and, hence, locally raised material efforts. To properly account for the real fibre path, the As-built Feedback Method has been developed. It transforms manufacturing data of AFP structures to as-built FE-models by suitably considering the realised fibre orientations as well as special fibre features like tight fibre curves. In the present paper, the Feedback Method is exemplarily applied to an AFP <b>tension</b> <b>strap.</b> By investigating failure analysis results, significant discrepancies have been identified between as-built and as-design.

40|$|The <b>tension</b> <b>straps,</b> {{which are}} {{primarily}} {{part of the}} preload structure, are also used to support the leads. The straps must support the lead connection to the coil, and must support the uncompensated parts of the leads.

In the present design the transfer of support of the lead between coil and strap is abrupt, and prone to stress concentration. A support concept that is schematically shown in figure 2 is recommended. It results from attempts to allow some flexibility in lead support as the support is transferred from coil to strap, while supporting the Lorentz loads on the lead.

40|$|In this {{prospective}} study, {{the effectiveness}} and biomechanical factors of spinal orthoses {{in the treatment}} of moderate adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients were investigated. In the first 20 months of orthotic treatment, the values of standing AP Cobb's angle, apical vertebral rotation, lumbar lordosis as well as thoracic kyphosis showed significant reduction (P< 0. 05), however, the angle of trunk inclination and trunk listing did not. The values of those reducible parameters reached their lowest values within the first 12 months of orthotic treatment and then the values gradually increased but they were still below the pre‐brace values. The mean pressure of The pressure pads was found to be 7. 09 ± 1. 77 kPa (53. 2 ± 13. 3 mmHg) while the mean <b>tension</b> of the <b>straps</b> was 26. 8 ± 5. 2 N. The standing AP Cobb's angle strongly correlated with the pad pressure (correlation coefficient= 0. 931, p< 0. 05) and <b>strap</b> <b>tension</b> (correlation coefficient= 0. 914, p< 0. 05). The <b>strap</b> <b>tension</b> and pad pressure strongly correlated and the correlation coefficient was 0. 873 (p< 0. 05).

30|$|The lack of {{difference}} in strap pressure in the two strap orientation conditions was {{in contrast to the}} previous study of Bowles and Steele [5] that reported higher strap pressures in cross-back orientated straps compared to vertical straps [5]. The mean peak pressures were of a lower range in the current study compared to those reported by Bowles and Steele [5] (current study 5.7 to 10.6 versus 11.7 to 14.9 kPa) [5], which is likely to be attributed to differences in the measurement devices (current study: one 10  mm 2 sensor versus ten 1  cm 2 sensors positioned in parallel) [5]. Ideally, it would be preferable to have the pressure sensors the same width as the bra strap. However, {{it is also possible that}} pressures in the cross-back orientation measured by Bowles and Steele [5] were falsely high due to overly tight straps. That is, the straps used by Bowles and Steele [5] were commercially available convertible bra straps of a fixed length, which did not allow for the additional length required to traverse the torso in the cross-back orientation.

Their remarkable enhancement to concrete mechanical properties, practicing active lateral confinement, low cost, easy to operate, ti me saving and no structure interruption during application have brought this technique as of the most affordable technique for column confinement, especially for high strength concrete (HSC) which naturally behaves insufficient in ductility. Although a great number of previous studies have demonstrated the performance of SSTT confinement, there are several anxieties related to the long term behaviour of SSTT confined columns which have yet been implemented especially in real hostile condition. Environmental effects, such as ultraviolet radiation exposure and saline solution (sea water) may affect the confining material properties, and therefore decrease the performance of the confined columns.

40|$|We {{performed}} {{a study on}} 32 idiopathic scoliotic patients (30 females, 2 males) treated with a Chêneau brace. Eighteen patients had a single right thoracic curve and 14 had a single right thoracolumbar curve. We used the TekScan 1 system (ClinSeat Type 5315 Sensor, TekScan, Boston MA, USA) to measure pressures at the skin-brace interface, assess the effect of <b>strap</b> <b>tension</b> and analyze the variation of these pressures with position and activity. The TekScan 1 device enabled identification of the pressure areas corresponding to the brace’s three loading points. The pressure under the main pad had a greater mean value than the pressure under the two counter-pads. Tightening the straps led to {{a significant increase in}} the pressures, whatever the position studied or the curve pattern. Compared with the standing (reference) position, we observed significantly higher pressures during maximal inspiration (p 5 0. 001) and lower pressures during maximal expiration, in the prone position and after having risen from a lying position, for both thoracic curves (p 5 0. 001) and thoracolumbar curves (p 5 0. 01). The pressures for thoracolumbar curves were lower than those for thoracic curves, whatever the position studied and both before and after strap adjustment. For lying positions, lying on the right side produced the greatest increase pressure. Even though the TekScan 1 system does not provide direct information on the correction of spinal curvature, it appears to be a useful tool in the treatment of scoliotic patients. Strap adjustment clearly influences the applied pressures – particularly those on the rib cage. During activity, there is a natural tendency to decrease the pressure; this justifies efforts to maintain <b>strap</b> <b>tensions</b> in general and during day wear in particular...|$|R
