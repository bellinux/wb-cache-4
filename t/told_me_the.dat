25|$|The civil celebrant {{program is}} almost entirely the result of one man's vision. Murphy himself <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> story of how he was opposed by his own staff, the public service, his fellow members of {{parliament}} and officials of the Labour Party. He defied all, and, on July 19, 1973, {{in the dead of}} night, typed the first appointment himself, found the envelope and stamp, walked to a post box and posted it himself.|$|E
25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew something was wrong, because Both was never up before then. They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept thinking of him and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E
500|$|The result at Cannes was a surprise; {{after the}} longest judging {{period in the}} festival's history, the Grand Prix went to neither of the two event favourites. Instead, the jury awarded the prize to [...] "Lamp", a U.S. {{advertisement}} directed by Spike Jonze for the IKEA chain of furniture stores. Voted second was a British ad, [...] "Ear Tennis" [...] for the Xbox video game console. Chief among speculated reasons for the outcome was the plagiarism debate surrounding [...] "Cog". Ben Walker told Adweek [...] "A couple {{of people on the}} jury <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> reason it didn't win is 'cause they didn't want to be seen to be awarding something which people in some corners had said we copied." ...|$|E

Its first track, [...] "Megalomaniac", was featured in the film , {{and was the first}} song from its soundtrack to receive radio airplay. [...] Tim Skold, formerly of the band Shotgun Messiah, made his first appearance as a band member, writing lyrics and performing vocals on [...] "Anarchy". Looking back on Symbols in 2002, Konietzko said, [...] "I listened to the Symbols album and heard exactly why KMFDM broke up in the first place. It <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> story of what went wrong. There were maybe two (good) songs on that album and the others were just a bunch of compromising tug-of-wars. That was something I was not going to do again." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 15, 2004, when Red Sox regular {{starting}} {{third baseman}} Bill Mueller {{was placed on}} the disabled list, Youkilis was called up for the first time.

I got in there, and man, I was just amped up and excited." [...] During his first major-league game in Toronto, with his parents watching from the second row behind the dugout, Youkilis (in his second at bat) homered against 1996 Cy Young Award winner Pat Hentgen, becoming just the seventh player in team history to hit a home run in his first game. As a prank, the team initially gave Youkilis the silent treatment {{when he returned to the}} dugout after his homer. [...] "This one will go down probably as the greatest day of my life", he said.|$|E
500|$|Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided. Less {{than a month}} later, on 20 June 1837, William IV {{died at the age}} of 71, and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. In {{her diary}} she wrote, [...] "I was awoke at 6 o'clock by Mamma, who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see me. I got out of bed and went into my sitting-room (only in my {{dressing}} gown) and alone, and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes past 2 this morning, and consequently that I am Queen." [...] Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria, but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.|$|E

500|$|Serbian writer Janko Veselinović {{was well}} acquainted with the {{folklore}} of Tamnava, where {{he worked as a}} teacher in a village. In his short story published in 1888, an elderly woman talks to him about various supernatural beings, including her co-villager Petar, a vetrenjak: [...] "As soon as he perceives a greyish cloud and hears thunder, Petar leaves whatever he may be doing, and goes somewhere. He runs so fast that no biped can overtake him. After he passes the cloud, he comes back naked and blue as indigo. Then he has to stay in bed for a week. And do you know why he is like that? He <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>The</b> pogibaoci [...] from surrounding villages drive the clouds toward our village, and Petar will not let hail beat us. He fights with them until he will overpower them, or they him... 'We uproot oaks, as one would pull onion bulbs from the ground, and beat each other with them.'" ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the filming}} of Last Summer, a seagull was killed. [...] "In one scene," [...] Hershey explained, [...] "I had to throw the bird {{in the air to}} make her fly. We had to reshoot the scene over and over again. I could tell the bird was tired. Finally, when the scene was finished, the director, Frank Perry, <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> bird had broken her neck on the last throw." [...] Hershey felt {{responsible}} for the bird's death and changed her stage name to [...] "Seagull" [...] as a tribute to the creature. [...] "I felt her spirit enter me," [...] she later explained. [...] "It was the only moral thing to do." [...] The name change was not positively received. When she was offered a part opposite Timothy Bottoms in The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder (1974) (or Vrooder's Hooch), Hershey had to forfeit half her salary, $25,000, to be billed under the name [...] "Seagull" [...] because the producers were not in favor of the billing.|$|E

500|$|The {{track is}} {{followed}} by a long sample of a London Underground train arriving at and leaving a tube station, with its recorded warning to passengers, [...] "Mind the gap...". [...] "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)" [...] follows, featuring The JAMs' associates Chike (rapper) and DJ Cesare (scratches). Built around The Dave Brubeck Quartet's [...] "Take Five" [...] and Fred Wesley's [...] "Same Beat", the lyrics are mostly unconventional, with the majority of the song containing references to food: [...] "I was pushing my trolley from detergent to cheese when I first saw the man with antler ears. I tried to ignore but his gaze held my eyes when he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> truth about the basket of lies". Sounds considered the message of the song (if any) to be a modern version of Robin Hood: [...] "This is piracy in action, with the venerable music industry figure, King Boy D, setting himself up as the Robin Hood of rap as he steals from the rich vaults of recording history".|$|E

So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> first take was perfect.
