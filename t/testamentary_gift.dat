5000|$|In 1885, the Bagley family chose Henry Hobson Richardson {{to design}} the fountain. In 1887, the Bagley Memorial Fountain was {{dedicated}} {{at the corner of}} Woodward Avenue and Fort Street. Richardson constructed the fountain entirely out of pink Bragville granite, modeled after a ciborium located in St. Mark’s Basilica in Venice. The Bagley Memorial Fountain stands 21 feet high with a basin 7 feet across. At the center of the fountain, four lion heads distribute water. In the original design, two of the heads produced [...] "normal" [...] temperature water and the other two produced cold water, chilled by ice packed around the fountain pipes.

Even examples of contemporary marriage contracts demonstrate that the ideals of the Custom with regards to family, inheritance, and marriage imbued families with a closeness and collaborative spirit in setting up the marital communities of their children and protecting them as best they could.|$|R

40|$|The law grants {{individuals}} {{the broad}} freedom of disposition {{to decide how}} their property should be distributed upon death. The rationale underlying freedom of disposition is that the choices of individual donors produce results that maximize social welfare. Policymakers are rightfully skeptical that they can craft a mandatory estate plan that fits all situations or that probate courts can consistently and accurately assess the merits of particular dispositions of property. By contrast, the donor {{is in the best}} position to evaluate her own specific circumstances and to place property in the hands of the donees who will benefit the most. The donor, however, is not the sole decision-maker regarding the disposition of her property after death. To be sure, she enjoys broad freedom to craft an estate plan to her liking. But when the donor decides to make a gift to a particular donee, the donee must also make a decision. Specifically, she must decide either to accept the gift from the donor or to reject it. Whereas the donor’s discretion to decide which <b>testamentary</b> <b>gifts</b> to make is referred to as freedom of disposition, the donee’s discretion to decide which <b>testamentary</b> <b>gifts</b> to accept or to reject can be labeled “freedom of inheritance. ” Although legal scholars have paid much attention to the donor’s freedom of disposition and have explained that it plays an important role in maximizing social welfare, relatively little attention has been paid to the donee’s freedom of inheritance and the role it plays in maximizing the utility generated from the donor’s estate. To fill this analytical void, this Article defines the donee’s freedom of inheritance and identifies how it works in concert with the donor’s freedom of disposition to maximize social welfare. Ultimately, this Article argues that the donee’s freedom of inheritance is an important part of the process of transferring wealth after death and that policymakers should strive to facilitate the donee’s exercise of this freedom when crafting the law of succession...|$|R
5000|$|Intestacy has {{a limited}} {{application}} in those jurisdictions that follow civil law or Roman law because {{the concept of}} a will is itself less important; the doctrine of forced heirship automatically gives a deceased person's next-of-kin title to a large part (forced estate) of the estate's property by operation of law, beyond the power of the deceased person to defeat or exceed by <b>testamentary</b> <b>gift.</b> A forced share (or legitime) can often only be decreased on account of some very specific misconduct by the forced heir. In matters of cross-border inheritance, the [...] "laws of succession" [...] is the commonplace term covering testate and intestate estates in common law jurisdictions together with forced heirship rules typically applying in civil law and Sharia law jurisdictions.After the Statute of Wills 1540, Englishmen (and unmarried or widowed women) could dispose of their lands and real property by a will. Their personal property could formerly be disposed of by a testament, hence the hallowed legal merism last will and testament.|$|E

The {{rules of civil}} legislation and scientists? views on the <b>testamentary</b> <b>gift</b> legal nature are analyzed. To this end historical and comparative analysis scientific research methods were used. By dint of historical scientific method the <b>testamentary</b> <b>gift</b> nature reception from Ancient Rome Law was proved. Comparative analysis scientific research method have been used during the research of current legislation rules and comparing them to appropriate rules of RUFSR and Russian Federation (RF) legislation. Famous civil law scientists? points of view are highlighted. G. A. Bunich said that a <b>testamentary</b> <b>gift</b> is a special clause in a will. B. S. Antimonov analysed civil law rules and considered that <b>testamentary</b> <b>gift</b> was an obligation. Thus a legatee was a creditor and a heritor was a debtor. Legatee received rights to demand from the heir to fulfil the will. E. O. Kharitonov supported such a position and in his Ukraine Civil Code comments considered that a testator may obligate the heir to give his o her rights to another person. S. Y. Fursa and E. I. Fursa exemplify that a <b>testamentary</b> <b>gift</b> could be an obligate to pay legatee?s debt or to buy some thing and {{to give it to}} the legatee or to give legate right to drive a car for some period. There is no term of <b>testamentary</b> <b>gift</b> in the Civil Code of Ukraine. But the subject of legate (<b>testamentary</b> <b>gift)</b> is to transfer a thing to legatee in a property or another proprietary right. A thing can {{be a part of the}} heritance or not. Rules for testamentary gifts in Ukraine and RF were compared. The Civil Code of RF has rules that <b>testamentary</b> <b>gift</b> can be established not only for testamentary heirs but for legal heirs too. Ukrainian laws don?t have such rules and a <b>testamentary</b> <b>gift</b> is an obligation for testamentary heirs only. But according to the Civil Code of Ukraine legatee has a proprietary nature. In this article author concludes that in practice a <b>testamentary</b> <b>gift</b> is an obligation mostly. Court decisions also prove it. At the same time it can not be excluded that a <b>testamentary</b> <b>gift</b> can have a proprietary nature. ??? ???????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????? ????? ?????? ???????? ????????????, ??? ???????????? ? ????????????-?????????????. ??? ?????? ????????????? ?????? ???????? ???????? ?????????????? ?????? ?? ????? ???????? ????. ????????????-????????????? ????? ?????????? ?? ????? ???????????? ???? ???????????? ???????????????? ??????? ? ????????????? ?? ? ???????????????? ??????? ???????????????? ????? ? ??. ?????? ????? ? ???, ??? ????????????? ????? ? ??????????? ??????? ?? ???????? ????? ????????????????-???????? ???????. ? ?? ?? ????? ?????? ????????? ??????????? ?????? ??????? ?????????????? ??????...|$|E

50|$|Ferdinando Gorges {{was born}} between 1565 and 1568, {{probably}} in Clerkenwell, in Middlesex {{where the family}} maintained their London town house, but possibly at the family's manor of Wraxall, in Somerset. He was the second son of Edward Gorges of Wraxall, by his wife Cicely Lygon. The circumstances of his father's death aged 31 suggested to Baxter (Gorges's first biographer) that Ferdinando was born at {{about the time of}} his father's death on August 29, 1568. Edward Gorges, however, evidently realizing that his illness was fatal, prepared his will on August 10, 1568, (and proved on September 17 of the same year) in which Edward bequeathed to Ferdinando a 23-ounce gold watch and devised to him the manor of Birdcombe, Wraxal, for a term of 24 years.
