5|$|In 1824 the Weights and Measures Act imposed one {{standard}} 'imperial' system of {{weights and measures}} on the British Empire. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> act was to standardise existing British units of measure rather than to align them with the metric system.|$|E
5|$|Fauré's {{ambidexterity}} {{is reflected}} in the layout of many of his piano works, notably in the barcarolles, where the main melodic line is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of the keyboard {{as well as in the}} bass. Duchen likens <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> in the barcarolles to that of a reflection shining up through the water.|$|E
5|$|In early March 2014, {{the film}} was leaked into the Internet. Two people related to the film leakage were arrested on 8 March 2014. They were {{identified}} as Mubashir Sheik and Sheik Abid Basha hailing from Guntur. Basha illegally accessed the feed of the film and handed it over to Sheik who then uploaded it on YouTube. Post release, the film {{became one of the}} most downloaded titles in recent times and the Anti-Video Piracy team worked for a week since the film's release to reduce <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> leak on the film's gross.|$|E

5|$|Lazio faced {{a unique}} {{tactical}} problem campaigning upstate. The major issue {{there was the}} persistently weak local economy, which Lazio hoped to link to his opponent's husband's tenure in office. Attacks {{on the state of}} the upstate economy were frequently interpreted as criticism of incumbent Republican governor George Pataki, however, limiting <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> line of attack.|$|E
5|$|There {{are fewer}} than 1000 adult birds in Tasmania, where {{the species is}} listed as Vulnerable under Schedule 3.1 of the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. In Tasmania it is {{threatened}} by nest disturbance, loss of suitable nesting habitat, shooting, poisoning, trapping, and collision with power lines and wind turbines, as well as entanglement and environmental pollution. Estuaries are a favoured habitat, and these are often subject to environmental disturbance. white-bellied sea eagles have been observed to increase their hunting ranges to include salmon fish farms, but <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> on breeding success is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle East {{and eastern}} Mediterranean, two ongoing {{international}} disputes developed into crises. The Cyprus dispute {{turned into a}} crisis with the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, causing extreme strain within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance. In mid-August, the Greek government withdrew Greece from the NATO military structure; in mid-September 1974, the Senate and House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted to halt military aid to Turkey. Ford, concerned with both <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> on Turkish-American relations and the deterioration of security on NATO's eastern front, vetoed the bill. A second bill was then passed by Congress, which Ford also vetoed, although a compromise was accepted to continue aid {{until the end of}} the year. As Ford expected, Turkish relations were considerably disrupted until 1978.|$|E

5|$|The {{manpower}} problem {{was compounded by}} the supply crisis which was affecting the entire nation, with the fleet going unpaid and largely unfed for months at times. In August 1793, these problems {{came to a head}} in the fleet off Brest, when a lack of provisions resulted in a mutiny among the regular sailors. The crews overruled their officers and brought their ships into harbour in search of food, leaving the French coast undefended. The National Convention responded instantly by executing a swathe of senior officers and ship's non-commissioned officers. Hundreds more officers and sailors were imprisoned, banished or dismissed from naval service. <b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> purge was devastating, seriously degrading the fighting ability of the fleet by removing at a stroke many of its most capable personnel. In their places were promoted junior officers, merchant captains and even civilians who expressed sufficient revolutionary zeal, although few of them knew how to fight or control a battle fleet at sea.|$|E
5|$|The Khurasani {{tax system}} had been {{established}} {{at the time of}} the Muslim conquest and remained unchanged since. It relied on the collection of a fixed tribute by the local non-Muslim (mostly Zoroastrian) gentry, the dihqans, who often discriminated against the Muslim settlers and the native converts. This contributed to the latter's increasing resentment of Umayyad rule, and the demand for a tax reform had fuelled past revolts like that of Ibn Surayj. Consequently, Nasr streamlined the tax system in 739, implementing a blanket imposition (the kharaj) on all owners of agricultural land and forcing the non-Muslims to pay an additional poll tax (the jizyah). In this way, the chroniclers report, 30,000 Muslims were absolved of the jizyah, and 80,000 non-Muslims were forced to pay it instead. Attention was also paid to the accurate collection of the kharaj in accordance with treaties with the local rulers, as a result of which the tax burden was generally eased. This reform is traditionally held to have assisted in regaining the loyalty of the local populations and their princes, who returned quickly to the Arab fold; other modern scholars however consider <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> belated reform on the prevailing anti-Umayyad climate as minimal. Upon his appointment, Nasr also moved the provincial capital back to Merv from Balkh, where Asad had established it. Additionally, for the first time in the province's history he appointed sub-governors. They were drawn from among his allies and supporters in order to reward them and to improve his own control of the province.|$|E

50|$|Chemical {{scarification}} uses {{corrosive chemicals}} to remove skin and induce scarring. <b>The</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> method are typically similar to other, simpler forms of scarification; {{as a result}} there has been little research undertaken on this method.|$|R
25|$|Antivenom is {{available}} in South America for the venom of related species of recluse spiders. However, the bites, often being painless, usually do not present symptoms until 24 or more hours after the event, possibly limiting <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> intervention.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is {{that the}} {{inflection}} in the titration curves for very weak acids and very weak bases is small, because they approach the pH limits in water of 14 or 0 respectively, thus making endpoint detection relatively more difficult.|$|E

50|$|As stadiums {{have been}} developed, and are {{generally}} now nearly sealed constructions, meaning {{there is less}} light and air movement on the playing surface, new processes and procedures have been introduced to counterbalance <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b>|$|R

25|$|Some doctors {{believe that}} during a {{caesarean}} section, mechanical cervical dilation {{with a finger}} or forceps will prevent the obstruction of blood and lochia drainage, and thereby benefit the mother by reducing risk of death.
