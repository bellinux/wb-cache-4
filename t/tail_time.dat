6000|$|As the Colonel {{had opened}} the question, I ventured to make a respectful remonstrance against the scheme. Vindictiveness {{on the part of}} a man so simple and generous, so fair and noble in all his {{dealings}} as Thomas Newcome, appeared in my mind unworthy of him. Surely his kinsman had sorrow and humiliation enough already at home. Barnes's further punishment, we thought, might be left to time, to remorse, to the Judge of right and wrong; Who better understands than we can do, our causes and temptations towards evil actions, Who reserves the sentence for His own tribunal. But when angered, the best of us mistake our own motives, as we do those of the enemy who inflames us. What may be private revenge, we take to be indignant virtue and just revolt against wrong. The Colonel would not hear of counsels of moderation, such as I bore him from a sweet Christian pleader. [...] "Remorse!" [...] he cried out with a laugh, [...] "that villain will never feel it until he is tied up and whipped at the cart's <b>tail!</b> <b>Time</b> change that rogue! Unless he is wholesomely punished, he will grow a greater scoundrel every year. I am inclined to think, sir," [...] says he, his honest brows darkling as he looked towards me, [...] "that you too are spoiled by this wicked world, and these heartless, fashionable, fine people. You wish to live well with the enemy, and with us too, Pendennis. It can't be. He who is not with us is against us. I very much fear, sir, that the women, the women, you understand, have been talking you over. Do not let us speak any more about this subject, for I don't wish that my son, and my son's old friend, should have a quarrel." [...] His face became red, his voice quivered with agitation, and he looked with glances which I was pained to behold in those kind old eyes: not because his wrath and suspicion visited myself, but because an impartial witness, nay, a friend to Thomas Newcome in that family quarrel, I grieved to think that a generous heart was led astray, and to see a good man do wrong. So with no more thanks for his interference than a man usually gets who meddles in domestic strifes, the present luckless advocate ceased pleading.|$|E

The origin of such factors comes from a natural phenomenon, lightning and are called the Lightning impulses. These impulses are momentary and are of several kilovolts to few hundreds of kilo volts. These impulses are to be replicated in the laboratory for the testing of the power system equipments.

This project describes {{the development of a}} cost effective and easily portable compact 10 stages Marx Generator capable of producing lightning impulses voltage up to 25 kV. In addition, three different experimental circuits of HV DC supplies have been made. The highest output was 2. 5 kV DC which was taken as the main supply for the experimental and simulated Marx generator circuit. This generator can be used by small scale industries and academic institutions to demonstrate impulse voltages and also to perform testing on insulators of lower rating in laboratory.

40|$|Datacenters are {{the main}} {{infrastructure}} on top of which cloud computing services are offered. Such infrastructure may be shared by {{a large number of}} tenants and applications generating a spectrum of datacenter traffic. Delay sensitive applications and applications with specific Service Level Agreements (SLAs), generate deadline constrained flows, while other applications initiate flows that are desired to be delivered as early as possible. As a result, datacenter traffic is a mix of two types of flows: deadline and regular. There are several scheduling policies for either traffic type with focus on minimizing completion times or deadline miss rate. In this report, we apply several scheduling policies to mix traffic scenario while varying the ratio of regular to deadline traffic. We consider FCFS (First Come First Serve), SRPT (Shortest Remaining Processing Time) and Fair Sharing as deadline agnostic approaches and a combination of Earliest Deadline First (EDF) with either FCFS or SRPT as deadline-aware schemes. In addition, for the latter, we consider both cases of prioritizing deadline traffic (Deadline First) and prioritizing regular traffic (Deadline Last). We study both light-tailed and heavy-tailed flow size distributions and measure mean, median and <b>tail</b> flow completion <b>times</b> (FCT) for regular flows along with Deadline Miss Rate (DMR) and average lateness for deadline flows. We also consider two operation regimes of lightly-loaded (low utilization) and heavily-loaded (high utilization). We find that performance of deadline-aware schemes is highly dependent on fraction of deadline traffic. With light-tailed flow sizes, we find that FCFS performs better in terms of <b>tail</b> <b>times</b> and average lateness while SRPT performs better in average times and deadline miss rate. For heavy-tailed flow sizes, except for <b>tail</b> <b>times,</b> SRPT performs better in all other metrics. Comment: Technical Repor...|$|R

40|$|Mobile cloud {{computing}} is the state-of-the-art mobile distributed computing paradigm which comprises of three heterogeneous domains: mobile computing, {{cloud computing}}, and wireless networks aiming {{to enhance the}} computational capabilities of resource-constrained mobile devices towards a rich user experience. For example, heavy computations can be offloaded to the cloud to reduce energy consumption for the mobile device. However, we discovered that, in some mobile cloud application cases, it is more energy inefficient to use cloud computing than the traditional computing conducted in the local device. In our study, we chose a navigation application, Osmand, running on an Android mobile platform to do the empirical measurement because Osmand has both cloud-based and non-cloud-based versions. So, {{we were able to}} compare non-cloud-based Osmand and cloud-based Osmand in term of energy efficiency. In the empirical measurements, we found that non-cloud-based Osmand and cloud-based Osmand consume a similar amount of energy regarding to LCD and GPS activities. For non-cloud based Osmand, the majority of CPU energy consumption was used on calculating route results. In addition, we found that the complexity of maps affects the CPU energy consumption. On the other hand, the cloud-based Osmand consumes more CPU energy than non-cloud-based Osmand because the majority of CPU energy consumption was used for creating events and displaying on the mobile screen. Moreover, cloud-based Osmand needs a network connection to send a request to the cloud to calculate a route result. Thus, 3 G communications is considered as an extra factor that causes energy consumption in cloud-based Osmand. We found that 3 G communications makes cloud-based Osmand energy inefficient due to tail energy in 3 G communication costing extra energy consumption. Therefore, a prototype of an Energy Efficient Scheduling Manager (EESManager) was proposed and developed based on the awareness of tail energy and the complexity of maps. The results from the evaluation show that EESManager can improve the energy efficiency of cloud-based Osmand in two cases: 1) if the mobile device receives route results back from the cloud within the <b>tail</b> <b>time,</b> and 2) in the case when the mobile device does not receive the route results from the cloud within the <b>tail</b> <b>time</b> and the map scenario is simple...|$|E

For producing high voltage pulses Marx generator is the most popular and is most widely used method. This thesis describes the creation of a simulation circuit to match the output of a Marx Impulse Generator. In this project eight stages of standard Marx Impulse Voltage Generator were simulated and resulted impulse waves were recorded. The objective was to calculate the stray capacitance using standard formulas and embed that capacitance into the simulation circuit to adequately deliver a yield like that of the impulse generator. A genuine multi-staged impulse generator was utilized as the base. Eight distinctive levels of impulse voltage were tried, and the output waveforms were recorded. The simulation circuit was then subjected to a few cycles, conforming the capacitance qualities to achieve a yield as close as could be expected under the circumstances to that of the real generator. Finishes of the examination demonstrate that a successful simulation circuit could be made to give a yield that is near, yet not precisely that of, the genuine generator.

The interaction was first detected as a partial block of inward K+ current in elevated Ca 2 +, beginning near − 40 mV and becoming stronger at more negative voltage. Surprisingly, the time course of the block can be resolved as a rapid decay of inward current magnitude following a repolarizing step. The rapid decay of current is shown {{to be the result of}} channel block by using a two-pulse procedure that monitors the time course of gate closing. As a result of block, the decay of the tail current after repolarization is two to three times faster than gate closing. With physiological values for voltage and calcium concentration, block is readily detectable from <b>tail</b> <b>time</b> course, implying that it occurs as a normal concomitant of gate closing in Shaker. The slight voltage dependence of block from − 60 to − 100 mV suggests that Ca 2 + is bound (with low affinity) near the outer mouth of the channel. Elevated calcium quickens the inward gating current recorded as Shaker channels are closing; this current approximately doubles in amplitude and has a faster time course and quicker rising phase. When combined, the results suggest that calcium accelerates the first step in closing of the channel gate, perhaps by changing the channel's ion-occupancy state...|$|E
