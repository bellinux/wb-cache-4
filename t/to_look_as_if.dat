5|$|The {{desalination}} plant {{was impossible to}} hide, and since it had been built by the Italians, the enemy knew exactly where and what it was. Proud and Murray Dixon therefore disguised the plant <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it had been destroyed by a bomb. A trompe l'oeil black hole was painted {{over the top and}} one side of the building, along with shrapnel marks, shortly after a real attack which fortunately missed the plant; a disused chimney was actually demolished; real rubble, empty oil drums and real wrecked vehicles, which were in plentiful supply, were brought to decorate the compound; and some fake craters were constructed and decorated as if a stick of bombs had fallen right on target. The finishing touch was some real smoke from burning oily rags. The plant was not attacked again.|$|E
5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E

25|$|To {{add more}} realism, {{the locker room}} scenes were improvised for Rourke and others <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were {{actually}} socializing. Some of the deli scenes were improvised because Aronofsky was filming Rourke actually working there.|$|E
25|$|Artists such as Roland Penrose (author of the Home Guard Manual of Camouflage), Stanley William Hayter, Julian Trevelyan {{and many}} others were {{employed}} to conceal defences. In built-up areas pillboxes were disguised {{to look like a}} part of an adjacent building, carefully matched and provided with a roof <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they had always been there. In extreme cases, they were built inside existing buildings.|$|E

Wearing only {{underwear}} to limit blood spatter on himself, he first shot his step-father. The shot awoke his mother, who he shot in the face. Sellers tried to disguise his guilt by arranging the crime scene <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> an intruder had committed the killings.|$|E

25|$|Chidambaram and Tung {{found that}} group size mattered immensely in a group’s performance. The smaller the group, {{the more likely}} each member was to participate, {{regardless}} of range (dispersed or collocated). The main difference stated between distributed and collocated groups was the social pressure at least to appear busy that is present in collocated groups. When others are present, people feel the need <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they are working hard, while {{those who are not}} in the presence of others do not.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} set for {{the fictional}} Albert Square {{is located in the}} permanent backlot of the BBC Elstree Centre, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, at , and is outdoors and open to the weather. It was initially built in 1984 with a specification that it should last for at least fifteen years at a cost of £750,000. The EastEnders lot was designed by Keith Harris, who was a senior designer within the production team together with supervising art directors Peter Findley and Gina Parr. The main buildings on the square consisted originally of hollow shells, constructed from marine plywood facades mounted onto steel frames. The lower walls, pavements, etc., were constructed of real brick and tarmac. The set had to be made <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it had been standing for years. This was done by a number of means, including chipping the pavements, using chemicals to crack the top layer of the paint work, using varnish to create damp patches underneath the railway bridge, and making garden walls in such a way they appeared to sag. The final touches were added in summer 1984, these included a telephone box, telegraph pole that was provided by British Telecom, lampposts that were provided by Hertsmere Borough Council and a number of vehicles parked on the square. On each set all the appliances are fully functional such as gas cookers, the laundry washing machines and The Queen Victoria beer pumps.|$|E

500|$|Eight years later, Dr. B. Brookes Lee {{was arrested}} in Portland, Oregon. He {{had been accused of}} {{treating}} Sharkey to make it appear that he had been fouled by Fitzsimmons. Lee admitted it was true. [...] "I fixed Sharkey up <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had been fouled. How? Well, that is something I do not care to reveal, but I will assert that it was done—that is enough. There is no doubt that Fitzsimmons was entitled to the decision and did not foul Sharkey. I got $1,000 for my part in the affair." ...|$|E
500|$|The scenes filmed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{they were}} at the Lorton Penitentiary {{cafeteria}} were actually filmed at a former hospital storage facility. In order to dress the set, the structure had to be completely cleared of debris and garbage; this required that several old pump housings be [...] "jackhammered into smithereens". The episode's title, [...] "Kitsunegari" [...] (狐狩り) is the Japanese term for [...] "fox hunting". The series hired two Japanese translators to yield a proper translation of the phrase, {{due to the fact that}} [...] "fox hunting" [...] is not readily rendered in Japanese.|$|E

500|$|The {{scenes that}} were filmed {{outdoors}} in Los Angeles {{had to be}} crafted <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were cold; in reality, temperatures reached into 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and above. The snowmen used in the episode took a day to create and used over 100 tons of chipped ice. [...] "Classy Christmas" [...] was viewed by 7.18 million viewers and received a 3.7 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49, marking a slight drop in the ratings {{when compared to the}} previous week. Despite this, the episode was the highest-rated NBC series on the night that it aired. It received largely positive reviews from critics.|$|E
500|$|Frank Kameny soon {{realized}} the pivotal change {{brought by the}} Stonewall riots. An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, {{he was used to}} persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department, and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they could work for the U.S. government. Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, [...] "By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred." ...|$|E
500|$|The cold open {{features}} {{a montage of}} Jim setting up a prank—which involves sending Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail. Through Jim's voice-over, it is heavily suggested that Jim set up the prank sometime circa 2006, which would have taken place during the show's second season. Appropriately, the montage was filmed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the documentarians were using archival footage of Jim; his hair matches the style that Jim had {{during the first few}} seasons of the show. This {{is not the first time}} this technique has been used on the show. During the cold open for the sixth season episode [...] "Shareholder Meeting", a montage of Dwight harassing past receptionists was shown. Furthermore, during the seventh season episode [...] "Threat Level Midnight" [...] was filmed to give the impression that Threat Level Midnight, a amateur feature directed by Michael Scott, had been filmed and edited during the first seven or so seasons of the show.|$|E

500|$|The man sits {{before an}} {{imitation}} parapet with {{three sets of}} painted inscriptions, each rendered <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> chiselled or scratched into stone. Van Eyck did not have full command of either classical Greek or Latin and made errors, so readings by modern scholars vary. The first inscription is in Greek and seems to spell [...] "TYΜ.ωΘΕΟC", {{which has not been}} satisfactorily interpreted but has led some to title the work Timotheus. The middle reads in French [...] "Leal Souvenir" [...] ("Loyal Memory") and indicates that the portrait is a posthumous commemoration. The third records van Eyck's signature and the date of execution. The 19th-century art historian Hippolyte Fierens-Gevaert identified the lettering [...] "TYΜ.ωΘΕΟC" [...] with the Greek musician Timotheus of Miletus. Panofsky drew the same conclusion, eliminating other Greeks bearing the name Timothy; they were of religious or military background, professions that do not match the civilian dress of the sitter. Panofsky believed the man was probably a highly placed musician in Philip's court.|$|E
500|$|One of Camouflage's {{first major}} deceptions was the dummy railway at Misheifa. Barkas {{assigned}} the artist Steven Sykes {{to build a}} convincing dummy to divert enemy attention from the real railhead at Capuzzo bringing materiel for Operation Crusader. This complex deception involved [...] of dummy railway, a dummy train, dummy sidings, and a selection of dummy tanks, all made of gerida palm hurdles and other simple materials, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they had been delivered by the railway. More than 100 bombs were dropped on the Misheifa railhead, at least halving {{the attacks on the}} real thing at Capuzzo, giving the lie to the jokes about wooden bombs being dropped on wooden railways by an undeceived enemy. Barkas noted that [...] "camouflage men must be among the few otherwise sane beings who yearn to be bombed." [...] The pioneering effort's success was achieved in a few weeks, amidst severe shortages of men and raw materials. The writer Julian Trevelyan recorded that ...|$|E
500|$|Born to a Jewish-American {{family in}} Texas, Frank {{was raised in}} New York and {{earned a degree in}} {{mechanical}} engineering from Cornell University before moving to Atlanta in 1908. Marrying in 1910, he involved himself with the city's Jewish community and was elected president of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith, a Jewish fraternal organization, in 1912. Although antisemitism was not locally common, there were growing concerns regarding child labor at factories owned by members of the Jewish community. One of these children was Mary Phagan, who worked at the National Pencil Company where Frank was director. The girl was strangled on April 26, 1913, and found dead in the factory's cellar the next morning. Two notes, made <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she had written them, were found beside her body. Based on the mention of a [...] "night witch", they implicated the night watchman, Newt Lee. Over the course of their investigations, the police arrested several men, including Lee, Frank, and Jim Conley, a janitor at the factory.|$|E
