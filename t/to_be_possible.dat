She embarked the V6 and V10 prototypes for a period in 1942 and in January–February 1943. They used the small platform abaft the funnel to take-off and land. The Kriegsmarine (German navy) wished to evaluate their potential for anti-submarine warfare and mine reconnaissance, but visual detection proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> only in clear weather.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two days of the fire, the high thermal energy made the plume highly buoyant; this, {{together}} with settled weather conditions, allowed the plume to rise to a great height with little cross-mixing. When the fire was reduced in intensity it was reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> that the plume would be less buoyant and that ground-level smoke concentrations could then rise significantly. By 12 December, it was reported that the smoke cloud had reached northern France; it was expected to arrive in northern Spain by the weekend.|$|E
5|$|Manhattan {{shares a}} final kiss with Jupiter before departing {{permanently}} to another galaxy, while an enraged Dreiberg attacks Veidt, who makes {{no effort to}} defend himself. Nevertheless, he defends his actions, claiming that for world peace <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible,</b> {{there had to be}} sacrifice. Dreiberg rejects his logic declaring that Veidt has deformed and mutilated humanity. Dreiberg and Jupiter return to New York with plans to continue fighting crime. Later, an editor of the New Frontiersman tells a young employee that, as the world is at peace, there is nothing to report on. The editor gives the employee permission to print the contents of a collection of crank mailings, among which is Rorschach's journal.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem with}} using heavy water {{was that it}} was scarce, and {{scientists}} could not readily acquire the quantities required by a reactor. At Columbia University in the United States, Enrico Fermi and Leó Szilárd attempted to use graphite as a moderator instead. This turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible,</b> but the graphite had to be very pure, as impurities, particularly boron, tended to absorb neutrons. On 2 December 1942, Fermi's team initiated the first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in an experimental reactor known as Chicago Pile-1. For the Manhattan Project, this was a crucial step towards the manufacture of plutonium in a reactor for use in an atomic bomb, but much larger reactors were required for mass production.|$|E
5|$|The time-reversed {{dynamics}} of the automaton can be described by another cellular automaton. Clearly, for this <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible,</b> the update rule must be bijective. In the other direction, if the update rule is bijective, then it has an inverse function that is also bijective. This inverse function must be a cellular automaton rule. The proof of this fact uses the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of cellular automata rules as the translation-invariant functions that are continuous {{with respect to the}} Cantor topology on the space of configurations.|$|E
5|$|All but two {{elements}} up to bismuth (element 83) have an isotope that is practically stable for all purposes ("classically stable"), with the exceptions being technetium and promethium (elements 43 and 61). All elements from polonium (element 84) onward are measurably radioactive. 232Th {{is one of}} the three nuclides beyond bismuth (the other two being 235U and 238U) that have half-lives measured in billions of years; its half-life is 14.05billionyears, about three times the age of the earth, and slightly longer than the age of the universe. Four-fifths of the thorium present at Earth's formation has survived to the present. 232Th is the only isotope of thorium occurring in quantity in nature, and thorium is usually considered to be a mononuclidic element. Its stability is attributed to its closed nuclear shell with 142 neutrons. Thorium has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition, with atomic weight 232.0377(4). It is one of only three radioactive elements (along with protactinium and uranium) that occur in large enough quantities on Earth for this <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{a certain}} point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible,</b> each of the new {{daughter}} cells must have {{a full set of}} genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids {{in the presence of the}} nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.|$|E
5|$|From {{the five}} on the shortlist, two sites were considered, the Cathays Park Building and Cardiff City Hall. Cardiff City Hall was favoured because the {{executive}} and legislative functions would be separated, Cardiff City Hall was more widely recognised by the Welsh public and was a more prestigious building compared with the Cathays Park Building. The move to Cardiff City Hall would have also avoided a disruptive move for Welsh Office staff at the Cathays Park Building. The Welsh Office concluded that Cardiff City Hall would only remain an option if the initial costs were £17M or less, which was the top end of the estimate figure given in the white paper. This would only be possible if essential works were carried out immediately and {{the remainder of the}} work carried out later. Cardiff Council would need to agree a selling price of £5M or less for this <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Ray {{directed}} Kanchenjungha. Based on {{his first}} original screenplay, {{it was his first}} film in colour. The film tells of an upper-class family spending an afternoon in Darjeeling, a picturesque hill town in West Bengal. They try to arrange the engagement of their youngest daughter to a highly paid engineer educated in London. He had first conceived shooting the film in a large mansion, but later decided to film it in the famous hill town. He used the many shades of light and mist to reflect the tension in the drama. Ray noted that while his script allowed shooting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> under any lighting conditions, a commercial film contingent present {{at the same time in}} Darjeeling failed to shoot a single scene, as they only wanted to do so in sunshine.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, Anton Gimenez of the Filmoteca de Catalunya {{mentioned}} {{the existence of}} this print, which he believed to be in a state of total decomposition, to Serge Bromberg and Eric Lange of the French film company Lobster Films. Bromberg and Lange offered to trade a recently rediscovered film by Segundo de Chomón for the hand-colored print, and Gimenez accepted. Bromberg and Lange consulted various specialist laboratories in an attempt to restore the film, but because the reel of film had apparently decomposed into a rigid mass, none believed restoration <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible.</b> Consequently, Bromberg and Lange themselves set to work separating the film frames, discovering that only the edges of the film stock had decomposed and congealed together, and thus that many of the frames themselves were still salvageable. Between 2002 and 2005, various digitization efforts allowed 13,375 fragments of images from the print to be saved. In 2010, a complete restoration of the hand-colored print was launched by Lobster Films, the Groupama Gan Foundation for Cinema, and the Technicolor Foundation for Cinema Heritage. The digitized fragments of the hand-colored print were reassembled and restored, with missing frames recreated {{with the help of a}} black-and-white print in the possession of the Méliès family, and time-converted to run at an authentic silent-film speed, 14 frames per second. The restoration was completed in 2011 at Technicolor's laboratories in Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Several {{theoretical}} {{objections to}} the claims of Fermi's paper were quickly raised; in particular, the exact process that took place when an atom captured a neutron was not well understood at the time. This and Fermi's accidental discovery three months later that nuclear reactions could be induced by slow neutrons cast further doubt {{in the minds of}} many scientists, notably Aristid von Grosse and Ida Noddack, that the experiment was creating element 93. While von Grosse's claim that Fermi was actually producing protactinium (element 91) was quickly tested and disproved, Noddack's proposal that the uranium had been shattered into two or more much smaller fragments was simply ignored by most because existing nuclear theory did not include a way for this <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>possible.</b> Fermi and his team maintained that they were in fact synthesizing a new element, but the issue remained unresolved for several years.|$|E
