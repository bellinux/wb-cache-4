5|$|The Arena browser (also {{known as}} the Arena WWW Browser) is an early (now discontinued) testbed Web browser and Web {{authoring}} tool for Unix. Originally authored by Dave Raggett in 1993, the browser continued its development at CERN and <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Web</b> Consortium (W3C) and subsequently by Yggdrasil Computing. As a testbed browser, Arena was used in testing the implementation for HTML version 3.0, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Portable Network Graphics (PNG), and libwww.

5|$|However, in non-technical {{contexts}} and in software for <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Web,</b> the term URL remains widely used. Additionally, the term web address (which has no formal definition) often occurs in non-technical publications as {{a synonym for}} a URI that uses the scheme http or https. Such assumptions can lead to confusion, for example {{in the case of}} XML namespaces, which have a visual similarity to resolvable URIs.|$|E
5|$|Such {{identification}} enables {{interaction with}} {{representations of the}} resource over a network, typically <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Web,</b> using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. The {{most common form of}} URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), frequently referred to informally as a web address. More rarely seen in usage is the Uniform Resource Name (URN), which was designed to complement URLs by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.|$|E

5|$|While at Digital, Kotok {{recognized}} the Web's potential, {{and helped to}} found <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Web</b> Consortium. Early in 1994, in Zürich, Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee had met with Michael Dertouzos to discuss starting a new organization at MIT. In April 1994, Kotok, Steve Fink, Gail Grant and Brian Reid from Digital traveled to CERN in Geneva to speak with Berners-Lee {{about the need for}} a consortium to create open standards and coordinate Web development. Berners-Lee mentions the pivotal meeting with Digital in his book Weaving the Web.|$|E
5|$|The {{rise of the}} {{internet}} has resulted in many broadcasters ceasing their shortwave transmissions in favor of broadcasting over <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>wide</b> <b>web.</b> When BBC World Service discontinued service to Europe, North America, Australasia, and the Caribbean, it generated many protests and activist {{groups such as the}} Coalition to Save the BBC World Service. In the US, the shifting of resources from shortwave to Internet and television by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees U.S. international broadcasting, has also resulted in reduced broadcasting hours in the English language. Radio Netherlands, Voice of Russia (formerly Radio Moscow), Radio Canada International and Radio Australia are among the prominent broadcasters who have ceased broadcasting on shortwave. Although most of the prominent broadcasters continue to scale back their analog shortwave transmissions or completely terminate them, shortwave is still very common and active in developing regions such as parts of Africa.|$|E

Several major computer-related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s: Richard Stallman's GNU Project and the subsequent Free Software Foundation were founded in the mid-1980s at the AI Lab; the MIT Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology; <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Web</b> Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee; the OpenCourseWare project has made course materials for over 2,000 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002; and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005.|$|E
