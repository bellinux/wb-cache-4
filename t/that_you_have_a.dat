500|$|... "Fearless" [...] {{was written}} by Swift in {{collaboration}} with Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey and produced by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. Swift conceived the song while touring as opening act {{in order to promote}} her eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006). While writing the song, she was not dating anyone or [...] "even in the beginning stages of dating anybody." [...] She wrote the song after she analyzed the ideology of what was the best first date. While developing [...] "Fearless", Swift explained the writing process, stating, [...] "I think sometimes when you’re writing love songs, you don’t write them about what you’re going through at the moment, you write about what you wish you had." [...] The song was composed with two concepts in mind. Swift described the song's primary concept to be about [...] "the fearlessness of falling in love", and [...] "no matter how many times you get hurt, you will always fall in love again." [...] The second, is about the best first date, which Swift stated she hadn't experienced at the time of writing [...] "Fearless". After completing the song, Swift deeply deliberated her personal definition of the word [...] "fearless". To her, [...] "fearless doesn't mean you're completely unafraid and it doesn't mean that you're bulletproof. It means <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of fears, but you jump anyway." [...] That influenced her to title the album Fearless. The song was first released as a promotional single from the album on October 14, 2008 as part of Countdown to Fearless an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; it was later released as the fifth and final single from Fearless on January 4, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, McCotter {{was criticized}} in the Des Moines Sunday Register for a {{statement}} he made during a sermon about child rearing. The sermon {{was based upon}} the Bible verse Proverbs 20:30 ("Blows that wound cleanse away evil; strokes make clean the innermost parts.") In it, McCotter said, [...] "When you discipline, this verse indicates, as others do, {{that you want to}} do it so it wounds. Now, when you say ‘wounds,’ it doesn’t mean <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bloody mess on your hands necessarily. It doesn’t mean <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> child ‘wounding’ like he has a broken leg.... And he may, and often will be, black and blue. My children have been many times.

2500|$|Crespin's {{international}} {{career began}} {{when she was}} chosen by Wieland Wagner to portray the role of Kundry in Wagner's Parsifal at the 1958 Bayreuth Festival, {{despite the fact that}} she had never sung Wagner in German. To learn the role in German, she was coached by Lou Bruder, a professor of German literature who later became her husband. When Crespin first auditioned for Wieland she had initially assumed that he would cast her in what the French call les wagnériennes blondes, roles like Elsa, Eva, Sieglinde, and Elisabeth. She was therefore surprised when she was asked to tackle Kundry. Crespin recalls that when she expressed her surprise to Wieland he dismissed the other roles, saying, [...] "Oh, those dummies, I don't like them. Look, you are not born for <b>that,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better job to do." [...] Crespin essayed the task and her performance was so well liked that she was invited to sing Kundry again for the 1959 and 1960 Bayreuth Festivals. She returned to the Bayreuth Festival again in 1961 to sing Sieglinde in Wagner's Die Walküre and the third norn in Wagner's Götterdämmerung.|$|E

2500|$|During the New York printers' {{strike of}} 1963, when The New York Times {{and six other}} {{newspapers}} suspended publication, Hardwick, her husband Robert Lowell, and Jason and Barbara Epstein, saw an opportunity to introduce the sort of vigorous book review that Hardwick had imagined. Jason Epstein knew that book publishers would advertise their books in the new publication, since they had no other outlet for promoting new books. The group asked Silvers, who was still at Harper's, to edit the issue, and Silvers asked Barbara Epstein to co-edit it with him. Silvers and Epstein [...] "became an inseparable double act", editing The New York Review of Books together for the next 43 years, until her death in 2006. Silvers continued as sole editor {{until his death in}} March 2017. In later years, he described his motivation for continuing to edit the Review: [...] "I feel it's a fantastic opportunity – because of the freedom of it, because of the sense that there are marvelous, intensely interesting, important questions <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance to try to deal with in an interesting way. That's an extraordinary opportunity in life. And you'd be crazy not to try and make the most of it." [...] He said on another occasion: [...] "We do what we want and don't {{try to figure out what}} the public wants." [...] Asked in 2007 about who might succeed him as editor, Silvers replied: [...] "It's not a question that's posing itself". In 2012, he added, [...] "I can think of several people who would be marvelous editors." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July, Feige {{discussed}} specific {{moments in}} the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige [...] "wanted {{to see in a}} movie for a long, long time". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [...] lets her become part of what's really his life". Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, also. You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [...] doesn't seem like something out of left field. That's a pretty great moment and we didn't know until we showed it to audiences" [...] that it would work. Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] I was looking forward to, and I got {{to have a lot of}} fun shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E
