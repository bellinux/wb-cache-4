25|$|According {{to early}} adherents of Legio Maria, the Virgin Mary began {{appearing}} among the Luo {{people in the}} late 1920s. In their accounts, they say that she first appeared as an extraordinary itinerary woman. At a time estimated to be around 1935, this woman was walking at Awendo market in South Nyanza, when an empathizing tailor known as Omollo who {{was the son of}} Nyunja of Alego, Udida, gave her a dress gift. <b>This</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> said to have promised Omollo an eternal name among the Luos. From that day on she began calling herself the mother of Omollo. By the 1940s, <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> claimed to have visited the Catholic parish of Nyandago and conversed with over five members of its clergy about the mission of Ondetto. However, priests at Nyandago mission discounted the supposed apparitions, stating that Mary could not appear as a Black African.|$|E
25|$|Fergus of Galloway (died 12 May 1161) was a twelfth-century Lord of Galloway. Although his {{familial}} origins are unknown, it {{is possible}} that he was of Norse-Gaelic ancestry. Fergus first appears on record in 1136, when he witnessed a charter of David I, King of Scotland. There is considerable evidence indicating that Fergus was married to a bastard daughter of Henry I, King of England. Although the identity of <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> unknown, {{it is possible}} that she was the mother of Fergus' three children.|$|E
25|$|Cúirt An Mheán Oíche (The Midnight Court) by Brian Merriman (17471805) is {{something}} of an oddity in 18th-century Irish poetry in Irish. Merriman was a teacher of mathematics who lived and worked in the Munster counties of Clare and Limerick. Cúirt An Mheán Oíche, effectively his only poetic work, was written around 1780. The poem begins by using the conventions of the Aisling, or vision poem, in which the poet is out walking when he has a vision of a woman from the other world. Typically, <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> Ireland and the poem will lament her lot and/or call on her 'sons' to rebel against foreign tyranny.|$|E

Later that same year, she received her third and final Academy Award nomination for Sudden Fear for RKO Radio Pictures. In 1953, she appeared in her final film for MGM, Torch Song. The movie received favorable reviews and moderate success at the box office.|$|E
500|$|Following {{his meeting}} with Knútr, Echmarcach appears to have allied himself with the Uí Briain, the {{descendants}} of Brian Bóruma mac Cennétig, High King of Ireland (died 1014). In 1032, the eleventhfourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen states that Donnchad mac Briain, King of Munster (died 1064) married {{the daughter of a}} certain Ragnall, adding: [...] "hence the saying: 'the spring of Ragnall's daughter'". <b>This</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> elsewhere identified as Cacht ingen Ragnaill (died 1054). Like Echmarcach himself, Cacht's patronym could be evidence that she was a near relation of the Ragnalls who ruled Waterford, or else a descendant of Ragnall mac Gofraid. She could have therefore been a sister or niece of Echmarcach himself.|$|E
500|$|Aaron Stewart-Ahn was {{selected}} to direct the video based on his previous work directing the video for Death Cab For Cutie's [...] "Stable Song", as well as work documenting the band's live performances. [...] Stewart-Ahn said that the theme of travel had been inspired by Death Cab for Cutie's earlier song [...] "Transatlanticism", {{as well as his}} own extensive experience traveling solo, adding that [...] "I’ve always felt that travel is a defining human experience that changes you forever, and hope that this depiction of wanderlust, obsessiveness, repetition, and loneliness conveys some of that.” [...] He also said [...] "The idea is that the band is performing in an incredibly cold environment while <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> traveling around the world, moving toward progressively warmer climes. [...] The farther she gets from the song's obsessive protagonist, the more her world opens up, and the less reliable his memories of her become." ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{source of}} the musical is the eighth story, [...] "Our Heroine", which is thematically paired with the 12th, [...] "A Boar's Tooth", as both involve American {{encounters}} with local cultures. [...] "Our Heroine" [...] tells of the romance between Navy nurse Nellie Forbush, from rural Arkansas, and a wealthy, sophisticated planter, [...] Frenchman Emile De Becque. [...] After {{falling in love with}} Emile, Nellie (who is introduced briefly in story #4, [...] "An Officer and a Gentleman") learns that Emile has eight daughters, out of wedlock, with several local women. Michener tells us that [...] "any person... who was not white or yellow was a nigger" [...] to Nellie, and while she is willing to accept two of the children (of French-Asian descent) who remain in Emile's household, she is taken aback by the other two girls who live there, evidence that the planter had cohabited with a darker Polynesian woman. To her great relief, she learns that <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> dead, but Nellie endangers her relationship with Emile when she is initially unable to accept Emile's [...] "nigger children." [...] Nellie overcomes her feelings and returns to spend her life with her plantation owner.|$|E
500|$|On October 18, 2016, an {{anonymous}} woman sued Michael Jackson's Estate, MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures, alleging {{she had been}} sexually-abused by Jackson when she was 12-15, from 1986-1989 in Jackson's Encino home, hotels, the [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] set, the [...] "Moonwalker" [...] movie set, {{in the back of}} his limousine, his Neverland Ranch, and an apartment/condo he nicknamed [...] "The Hideout". She provided letters, love notes allegedly written by Jackson, multiple gifts apparently given by Jackson, a jacket he supposedly gave to her after an Album photo-shoot, checks given to her from 1990-1993 totaling $920,000 sent from Michael Jackson, MJJ Ventures, and MJJ Productions—coming directly from Jackson's back-accounts, and a 1993 Santa Barbara PD letter alleging that the Police Department concluded she [...] "knew all about Child Abuse" [...] to come in and speak to them, regarding their investigation. Her complaint alleges that she never considered her emotional/psychological injuries to be a result of her sexual activities with Jackson until she reflected on those experiences for the first time in September 2016, and that even if she had wanted to she could not possibly come forward earlier because she was threatened with physical harm if she ever told anyone, told that she would get in trouble with law enforcement and go to jail if she did, and that Jackson made her promise not to tell anyone. A lawyer for the Businesses dismissed the allegations saying, [...] "This is yet another attempt to hit the lottery by suing the estate of Michael Jackson more than seven years after Michael's death and close to 30 years after these incidents supposedly occurred. We believe this claim was created from whole cloth and is without any merit. It's also no coincidence that <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> represented by the same attorneys involved in two other frivolous claims against the estate." ...|$|E

Generally, two-spirit men practiced Shamanism {{and it was}} taboo for women {{to take on this}} role, but a two-spirit following this path was called an Iron Woman. The Half Sky two-spirit would be physically good at a man's trade (like hunting).

2500|$|The {{intention}} was to give Murphy's character Marcus Graham a cool, yet sophisticated style. [...] "So typically {{when it comes to}} black characters, either {{you have to be a}} successful, smart business person, or you're hip, but you're never both," [...] said Hudlin. [...] "And one of the reasons why the movie has had such enduring popularity is because the character is both. He's much more in the Cary Grant mode of business person." [...] While working on the characterization of the main character, Hudlin came up with the foot gag, which was used as a plot device to show the arc of the character's growth. It originated from a joke between the director and his friends about a man who's so picky about women that he even looks at their back teeth. [...] "So it's like, how do we define that Eddie's a back teeth kind of guy? So I came upon the idea of showing feet. That no matter how beautiful <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is,</b> if she has messed up feet, he's out of there." [...] Also, Hudlin said that [...] "we know he's evolved into a higher level of consciousness when he doesn't even notice what Halle Berry's feet look like." [...] The character Angela's art class was an idea the filmmakers had to put Murphy in a context where he could interact with kids, which he hadn't done prior to this film.|$|E
2500|$|On an {{occasion}} in 628, Wang was attending a feast held by Emperor Taizong, when a beautiful concubine of Emperor Taizong's, who was originally a concubine of Li Yuan the Prince of Lujiang {{and who was}} taken into Emperor Taizong's palace after Li Yuan was executed, was attending to Emperor Taizong. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "The Prince of Lujiang was despicable. [...] He killed her husband and seized her. [...] How could he survive long after this barbarous act!" [...] Wang instead responded, [...] "Does Your Imperial Majesty believe that the Prince of Lujiang was correct in seizing this woman?" [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Why do you ask me whether it is correct to kill a woman's husband and seize her?" [...] Wang responded, [...] "I had once read from the writings of Guan Zhong, which stated, 'When Duke Huan of Qi visited the land of Guo , he asked the seniors of Guo, [...] "Why was Guo destroyed?" [...] The seniors stated, [...] "The lord of Guo knew right from wrong." [...] Duke Huan responded, [...] "If you are correct, then he was an intelligent ruler. [...] Why was he destroyed?" [...] The seniors responded, [...] "The lord of Guo knew what was right but could not do it. [...] He also knew what was wrong but could not stop doing it. [...] That was why he was destroyed."' [...] Now, <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> still by your side. [...] I believe it is that Your Imperial Majesty in fact believes that this is right. [...] If you {{believe that this is}} wrong, you are the one who knows what is wrong and could not stop doing it." [...] Although Emperor Taizong could not send away the woman, he was nevertheless humbled by Wang's words and respected him for his words. [...] On another occasion, there was an incident where Emperor Taizong had the official Zu Xiaosun (祖孝孫) teach his ladies in waiting music, and when the ladies in waiting could not learn it well, rebuked Zu. [...] Wang and Wen Yanbo spoke against the rebuke, stating that it was not appropriate for Emperor Taizong to have had an important official become a music teacher for ladies in waiting in the first place. [...] Emperor Taizong became angry and rebuked Wen and Wang. [...] Wen bowed and begged for forgiveness, but Wang refused to do so, stating to Emperor Taizong that the rebuke to him and Wen was not warranted as they were reporting what was true. [...] Emperor Taizong was surprised, but the next day indicated to the high-level officials that he was rash and improper in rebuking Wang and Wen.|$|E
