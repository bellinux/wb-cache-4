25|$|In the book, Manji {{says that}} Arabs {{have made a}} mistake by denying that Jews have a {{historical}} bond with Palestine. Manji writes that the Jews' historical roots stretch back to the land of Israel, and that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to a Jewish state. She further argues that the allegation of apartheid in Israel is deeply misleading, noting that there are in Israel several Arab political parties, that Arab-Muslim legislators have veto powers, and that Arab parties have overturned disqualifications. She also writes that Israel has a free Arab press, that road signs bear Arabic translations, and that Arabs live and study alongside Jews.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{specific}} rights apply in criminal cases. Persons in custody {{have the right}} to consult a solicitor by virtue of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Access to Justice Act 1999 allows an individual to request confidential and free legal advice. The prosecution is under a common law duty to disclose all relevant evidence including that which may assist the defendant. The accused also benefits from a limited right to silence and the privilege against self-incrimination. Confessions are admissible as evidence under certain conditions laid down in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The accused additionally benefits from a presumption of innocence. In discharging the burden of proof, the onus is on the prosecution as established in Woolmington v DPP. For example, in R v Wang it was held that it was never permissible for a judge to direct a jury to find a defendant guilty. There is also a right to jury trial, the accused should be able to follow proceedings and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to be present during proceedings. The application of the double jeopardy rule was limited by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.|$|E

25|$|Articles 19 and 32-36 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child {{prohibits the}} {{exploitation}} of children in any form and in any context. Any child who is exposed to violence, exploitation or abuse {{can be considered a}} victim of crime and enjoys the correlated rights and entitlements, including access to assistance, protection and support, services for recovery and rehabilitation, access to justice, with due procedural safeguards in any related legal or administrative proceedings. Children at risk of exploitation have to be identified and recognised as being at risk. This implies that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to assistance and support in order to prevent their exploitation or any other harm resulting from the risks. Considering the difficulties of identifying children who have been trafficked and the broad protection against all forms and contexts of exploitation afforded under the Convention, a child rights-based approach prioritises the identification of child victims of exploitation or other crime and children at risk. Whether or not exploitation takes place in a context of trafficking is of subordinate relevance for the child rights and protection context. It may interest primarily the law enforcement investigations and the prosecution.|$|E
500|$|This {{decision}} {{ignited a}} firestorm of worldwide protest for disregarding the historic discoverer's right to name new elements, and against the new retroactive rule against naming elements after living persons; the American Chemical Society stood firmly behind the name seaborgium for element 106, together {{with all the other}} American and German naming proposals for elements 104 to 109, approving these names for its journals in defiance of IUPAC. At first, IUPAC defended itself, with an American member of its committee writing: [...] "Discoverers don't have a right to name an element. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to suggest a name. And, of course, we didn't infringe on that at all." [...] However, Seaborg responded: ...|$|E

2500|$|Other {{forms of}} Catch-22 are invoked {{throughout}} the novel to justify various bureaucratic actions. At one point, victims of harassment by military police quote the MPs' explanation {{of one of}} Catch-22's provisions: [...] "Catch-22 states that agents enforcing Catch-22 need not prove that Catch-22 actually contains whatever provision the accused violator is accused of violating." [...] Another character explains: [...] "Catch-22 says <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to do anything we can't stop them from doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{reason why}} states argue <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to {{regulate}} gaming {{has to do}} with negative effects associated with gambling. Gambling, in general, has been known to lead to [...] "compulsive addiction, increased drug and alcohol abuse, crime, neglect and abuse of children and spouses, and missed work days." [...] Those problems affect communities near Indian casino establishments. Many believe that because states are forced to deal with the negative consequences of Native American gaming, states should have greater power to regulate the Indian gaming industry.|$|E

However, despite the show's producers and ITV's lawyers approving the composition for broadcast, it was removed {{at the last}} minute. Responding on his blog, Minchin stated: [...] "Someone got nervous and sent the tape to ITV's director of television, Peter Fincham. And Peter Fincham demanded that I be cut from the show.

Scientific naturalists will take up the author upon his own peculiar ground; and there will we imagine be a severe struggle for at least theoretical existence. Theologians will say—and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to be heard—Why construct another elaborate theory to exclude Deity from renewed acts of creation? Why not at once admit that new species were introduced by the Creative energy of the Omnipotent? Why not accept direct interference, rather than evolutions of law, and needlessly indirect or remote action? Having introduced the author and his work, we must leave them to the mercies of the Divinity Hall, the College, the Lecture Room, and the Museum." [...] At Ilkley, Darwin raged [...] "But the manner in which he drags in immortality, & sets the Priests at me, & leaves me to their mercies, is base. He would on no account burn me; but he will get the wood ready and tell the black beasts how to catch me." [...] Darwin sprained an ankle and his health worsened, as he wrote to friends it was [...] "odious".|$|E
