5|$|M-156 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan. The highway is entirely within Lenawee County and begins in Morenci at the Ohio state line with State Route108 (SR108) and runs north to M-34 at Clayton. The highway runs through farm land along Lime Creek outside of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>communities,</b> providing access to the Lake Hudson State Recreation Area. The trunkline {{dates back to the}} early 1930s, and has been unchanged since a realignment in 1980.|$|E
5|$|The {{highway is}} legislated {{to begin in}} Ritzville at a {{junction}} with concurrent highways I-90 and US395 and travel east through a mixture of farm and desert landscapes, crossing over the Adams–Whitman county line in the process. A junction with SR23 near Ewan {{is to be the}} eastern terminus of the highway. Currently travelers wishing to travel between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> take the freeway to Sprague, then head southeast along SR23.|$|E
5|$|After Sri Lanka {{achieved}} {{independence in}} 1948, the ACTC decided {{to merge with}} the ruling United National Party (UNP). This move was not supported by half of the ACTC members and resulted in a splitone half of the party decided to merge with the UNP {{and the other half}} decided to leave the party altogether, forming a new Tamil party in 1949, the Federal party. Policies adopted by successive Sinhalese governments, and the 1956 success of the Sinhala Nationalist government under Solomon Bandaranaike, made the Federal Party the main voice of Tamil politics. Increased racial and political tension between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> led to the merger of all Tamil political parties into the Tamil United Liberation Front. This was followed by the emergence of a militant, armed form of Tamil nationalism.|$|E

5|$|At this {{interchange}} with I-96, US31 has its southernmost business loop as U.S. Route 31 Business runs westerly and northward into downtown Muskegon. The main freeway {{continues through}} the suburban {{eastern edge of}} the city through several interchanges, including one with M-46 (Apple Avenue). Just south of the Muskegon River, the business loop merges back into the main freeway. US31 crosses the river and turns northwesterly through forests. The freeway passes to the east of Michigan's Adventure, an amusement park, and crosses the White River near the communities of Whitehall and Montague; a business loop curves off to the west to connect <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> with the freeway. In this area, US31 runs through the southern portion of the Manistee National Forest as well.|$|E
5|$|M-222 is {{the current}} {{designation}} of a state trunkline highway in Allegan County of the US state of Michigan. It runs between the city of Allegan, where it connects with M-40/M-89, and the US Highway131 (US131) freeway near Martin. The highway runs along a series of streets in Allegan and through rural farm fields and woods between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> along 116th Avenue. The roadway was a state highway back in 1919 when the system was initially signed. It was assigned as part of M-89 and M-40 before being given its own number, M-118. That designation {{was applied to the}} highway until 1988 when that was retired in favor of the current M-222.|$|E

5|$|The Church of Ireland {{community}} had worshipped {{at the old}} church, which was in a ruinous state by 1829 when the new St. Paul's Church was built {{at the top of}} the hill, overlooking the town. The new Catholic church of St. Rynagh's had been constructed some three years earlier and on land given by the Armstrongs, the most influential and wealthiest Protestant family in the area, who consistently and energetically advocated Catholic Emancipation and repeal of the Penal Laws. This situation demonstrated the friendly relations that existed between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> in Banagher during those difficult times for Catholics in Ireland.|$|E

5|$|When {{the state}} highway system was {{originally}} signposted in 1919, the highway running northwest–southeast through Roscommon was numbered M-76. In 1949, M-18 was extended north into Roscommon and then west along M-76. During the early 1970s, M-76 was being {{converted into a}} freeway {{to be used as}} part of I-75. In 1971, I-75 was completed southward from the Grayling area to what is now exit239. Two years later, I-75 was completed between Roscommon and West Branch, and M-76 between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> was decommissioned. At the same time, M-18 was realigned to northeasterly out of Roscommon instead of following M-76 toward Grayling. BL I-75 was commissioned at this time to overlap M-18 from the freeway north into Roscommon and to replace the former M-18/M-76 west of the village to the new freeway.|$|E

5|$|In Menominee County, the {{environment}} {{takes on a}} more agricultural character along US2. The highway passes through {{the edge of the}} community of Hermansville before entering Powers. US2 comes to a three-way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US41. The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and Spaulding {{on the south side of}} the CN Railway. At Harris, the trunkline enters the Hannahville Indian Community. Harris is on the Menominee County side of the reservation, but as the highway continues east, it crosses over to Bark River on the Delta County side. The county line in between not only separates <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>communities,</b> but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones. East of Bark River, the highway crosses the community's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M‑69. The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of Escanaba.|$|E
5|$|M-21 was {{designated}} by July 1, 1919 on a routing from Ionia to Goodells. Along the way, it ran through Lyons and Pewamo, joining its current routing to Ovid. M-21 continued through Corunna to Lennon and Flint. There it joined its last routing between Flint and the Port Huron area. The highway {{was extended to}} Port Huron by 1924, and the west end was extended to Grand Rapids in 1925 along M-16 (later US16). The previous routing through Owosso and Lennon was redesignated as M-71 at this time when M-21 was shifted along the current routing between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>communities.</b> The 1926 creation of the United States Highway System led to the extension of M-21 along US16 to Grand Rapids. From there west, M-21 replaced M-51 on Chicago Drive to Holland. The highway was {{moved to a new}} routing between Flint and Lapeer in 1929; the old route was renumbered M-21A. All in-city portions of M-21 were transferred to state control in 1931 {{with the passage of the}} Dykstra Act of 1931 (PA 131 of 1931).|$|E
5|$|The Antemoro figure {{among the}} more recent {{settlers}} {{on the island of}} Madagascar. They are descended from Muslim seafarers who are believed to have arrived on the southeast coast around 1500. Boats carrying Muslim settlers had arrived on Madagascar's shores in the past, but there was a marked uptick in arrivals around this time. Upon arrival they encountered several other Malagasy ethnic groups including the Zafiraminia, who also traced their origins back to Mecca by way of East Africa, although some scholars suggest that the origins of the Zafiraminia was in Sumatra and who had developed a high status among Malagasy communities for the knowledge and technology they had carried with them from overseas, and who had the prerogative of practicing ritual animal sacrifice for the ancestors (sombili), a highly powerful and important rite among Malagasy communities. Oral and written historical traditions of the Antemoro describe their desire to secure marriages between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>communities,</b> but these efforts were rejected by the Zafiraminia. A conflict developed between the two groups for supremacy, which the oral histories of other Malagasy groups describe as a battle between two giants. The conflict evolved as additional Arab settlers arrived and joined with their fellow newcomers to become Antemoro themselves.|$|E

5|$|The {{alignment}} of NY167 follows the Paine's Hollow Road, constructed between Little Falls and Paines Hollow. This new road would shorten time between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> through Herkimer County. The Paine's Hollow Road opened on October 4, 1921, opening a new road through the dairy {{country of the}} Mohawk Valley. The new road had branch alignments toward Oneonta, Cooperstown and Richfield Springs. At 1 p.m. (1800 UTC) that day, a convoy of vehicles drove the route south from Little Falls, with a band on a large truck and a coach with six horses. When the group reached Paines Hollow, a ceremony was held, led {{by the president of}} the Little Falls Chamber of Commerce and H.P. Snyder, the local legislator for Herkimer County. The new section between Paines Hollow and Jordanville cost $123,136.25 (1921 USD) and was designated as State Highway1363.|$|E
5|$|West of the village, US20, NY5, and NY414 {{become a}} major {{commercial}} strip as it heads through an area situated between the hamlet of Seneca Falls and the village of Waterloo. Roughly midway between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>communities,</b> NY414 splits from US20 and NY5, becoming a commercial strip itself as it heads north through the northern portion {{of the town of}} Seneca Falls as Mound Road. Near the northern end of the strip, the route crosses the main line of the Finger Lakes Railway at a grade crossing. Past the crossing, the businesses give way to mostly undeveloped areas that persist into the neighboring town of Tyre, where it intersects NY318 in the small hamlet of Magee as Ridge Road. Just north of this intersection, NY414 intersects the New York State Thruway (I-90) at exit41. North of the Thruway, NY414 maintains a constant north-northwest alignment across rolling farmland into Wayne County.|$|E
5|$|A North Indian shopkeeper {{was killed}} in Bhandup, Mumbai after he refused to shut down his shop when MNS activists protesting Raj's arrest forced him to do so. Four persons were killed and another seriously injured in a village near Kalyan. Deputy {{commissioner}} of police (rural) Sanjay Shintre said two North Indians, {{a member of the}} Agri community and an MNS worker were killed in a clash between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> in Pisavali, 10km from Kalyan. Earlier, curfew had been imposed in the entire Kalyan area. The situation in Kalyan worsened in the evening as Raj was driven there to a police station lock-up where he was to spend the night before being presented in a court on 22 October. Five outdoor broadcast vans belonging to media houses were damaged by MNS supporters. A cameraman from ETV was injured and had to be admitted to a private hospital. One Kalyan-Dombivli municipal transport bus was set on fire while five bikes were reduced to ashes. Transport services across Kalyan were paralysed. A jewellery shop was also ransacked by MNS supporters. In all one hundred and twenty-five cases of arson, rioting and stonepelting were registered across the state, including in Pune and Marathwada, by early evening, and 2,085 people were arrested, state director general of police A N Roy said.|$|E

5|$|The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general {{election}} {{and led by}} Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress (led by Mahatma Gandhi) and the Muslim League (led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah)—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to {{how it should be}} implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than June 30, 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>communities</b> cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948. India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka became members of the Commonwealth, while Burma chose not to join.|$|E
