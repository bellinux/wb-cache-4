5|$|Between its closing as a rail {{bridge and}} its reopening as a {{pedestrian}} span, the bridge has seen occasional fires; {{two in the}} 1970s, one in 1987 and one in 2008. In 1987 Christmas lights posted on the bridge to promote a toy drive started the fire; both the Jeffersonville and Louisville Fire Departments fought six to eight hours to put out <b>the</b> <b>blaze.</b>|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the hotel}} was {{occupied}} by Japanese troops, and the Japanese flag was flown above the walls for {{the entirety of the}} war. During the Battle for the Liberation of Manila, {{the hotel was}} set on fire by the Japanese. The shell of the building survived <b>the</b> <b>blaze</b> and the structure was later reconstructed.|$|E
5|$|In Beijing, {{authorities}} halted renovation projects {{similar to}} the one being done on the apartment in Shanghai shortly after <b>the</b> <b>blaze.</b> The projects, intended to save energy by installing insulation, were stopped on 19 November, pending safety evaluations of the work. The insulation is still flammable, despite the use of fire retardants. Shanghai officials temporarily stopped such renovations after the fire, but later allowed them to resume.|$|E

5|$|Lawsuits {{on behalf}} of sixteen people and {{businesses}} claiming losses {{as a result of}} <b>the</b> <b>blaze</b> were filed shortly after the fire in 1991. In February 1995 a $15 million agreement was reached to reimburse workers and businesses affected by the fire. While not admitting any liability, the $15 million minus legal fees was paid by E/R Partners and was meant for uninsured losses for businesses and workers in One Meridian and the surrounding damaged buildings.|$|E
5|$|On 20 July 1913, {{while making}} an {{intermediate}} stop in Hoboken, New Jersey, Breslau was being warped into position when an electrical {{fire broke out}} at the pier where she was docking. Breslau made an emergency departure into the Hudson River, during which time <b>the</b> <b>blaze</b> was extinguished. The ship was not damaged {{and none of the}} 1,500 passengers aboard were injured in the incident. The ship left for Philadelphia on schedule the next day.|$|E
5|$|On 20 November 1992, a {{major fire}} {{occurred}} at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread {{damage to the}} Upper Ward. The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated {{as part of a}} long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms, and severely damaged more than 100 others. Fire-fighters applied water to contain <b>the</b> <b>blaze,</b> whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection. The fire spread through the roof voids and efforts continued through the night to contain <b>the</b> <b>blaze,</b> at great risk to the 200 fire-fighters involved. It was not until late afternoon that <b>the</b> <b>blaze</b> began to come under control, although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning. Along with the fire and smoke damage, one of the unintended effects of the fire-fighting was the considerable water damage to the castle; more than 1.5 million gallons of water were used to extinguish it, which in many ways caused more complex restoration problems than the fire.|$|E

5|$|On 27 February 1939 the {{new owner}} of the rectory, Captain W. H. Gregson, was {{unpacking}} boxes and accidentally knocked over an oil lamp in the hallway.

5|$|On November 23, 1957, tragedy struck {{when the}} Lathrop Building caught on fire. Firemen {{rushed to the}} scene to put out <b>the</b> <b>blaze</b> and did so quickly, but not before the {{television}} and radio studios on the top floors of the building were destroyed. The News-Miner offices and printing facilities on the lower floors were spared from the flames, but suffered water damage. Due to winter temperatures, the water soon froze. Despite the conditions, the paper was produced on time the next day.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of September3, 2007, a malicious fire was set {{in the base of}} the Webster Sycamore's trunk. The fire burned up through the hollow center of the tree's hollow bole. The Webster Springs Fire Department, Webster County Sheriff's Department, and the West Virginia Division of Forestry provided a joint response to the fire, and remained on the scene for several hours until the flames were out. The tree survived <b>the</b> <b>blaze</b> but suffered irreparable damage.|$|E

These trees are located within the fringe of bush round the site and are not obviously tampered with. <b>The</b> <b>blazing</b> is unimposing but remains present {{on a number of}} trees at the camp sites. The fact that <b>the</b> <b>blazes</b> are not readily evident without examination has probably enabled most to survive.|$|R
5|$|The Dutch central {{division}} {{joined the}} battle {{at the head}} of the line shortly after the engagement of Triumph and Bedford, causing considerable damage to all of the British vessels, particularly Venerable. The British flagship was soon isolated in the midst of the Dutch van, engaging Vrijheid, Staaten General, Admiral Tjerk Hiddes De Vries and Wassenaar simultaneously. Despite the heavy odds Duncan continued to fight hard, the British succeeded in knocking out two opponents by wounding Captain Dooitze Eelkes Hinxt of Beschermer, which drifted eastwards in confusion, while shots from either Bedford or Triumph set a powder barrel on Hercules on fire. <b>The</b> <b>blaze</b> on the latter ship, which soon spread to the sails and rigging, prompted a lull in the battle as the crew of Hercules desperately attempted to extinguish <b>the</b> <b>blaze</b> and other Dutch ships scrambled to escape the burning vessel as it drifted through the melee. Shortly afterwards, the battered Wassenaar surrendered to Triumph, with Captain Holland dead on his quarterdeck. Triumph then moved on towards the battle between Vrijheid and Venerable, at which time the crew of Wassenaar raised their colours again after being fired on by a Dutch brig.|$|E
5|$|Three {{helicopters}} {{had been}} called in {{to assist in the}} rescue, but were prevented by thick smoke generated by the fire. The upper portion of the building was beyond the reach of fire apparatus; <b>the</b> <b>blaze</b> was brought under control only after firefighters set up hoses atop a nearby building. In all, 25 fire stations and over 100 fire appliances were mobilised in response to the incident.|$|E
5|$|A {{doctor at}} Shanghai's Jing'an Hospital said that over 20 people {{injured in the}} fire had been admitted, many {{suffering}} from asphyxia caused by smoke inhalation. State media reports said the hospital was treating 55 survivors, including nine in serious condition. At least 70 people, and possibly more than 120 people {{were reported to have}} been injured. According to BBC News, people who survived <b>the</b> <b>blaze</b> were searching hospitals for missing family and friends. As of 24 November, 66 wounded people, 14 of which were in critical condition, were being treated at seven area medical centers. In all, nine hospitals received victims of the fire.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Hipper {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven. After the routine maintenance was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The engine oil feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until <b>the</b> <b>blaze</b> could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper motionless for several hours on the open sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{under the}} PRC State Council was announced on 16 November, {{the day after}} the fire, to determine the cause of <b>the</b> <b>blaze.</b> A preliminary finding by investigators concluded that sparks from welding work being done on the building, undertaken by unlicensed welders, ignited scaffolding around the structure, which led to the apartments' destruction. The municipal government also placed the blame on illegal multi-layered subcontracting, and detained four managers from several construction companies. In all, sixteen individuals have been arrested in connection to the fire, as well as four others accused of being unlicensed welders.|$|E
5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell {{penetrated}} {{the side of the}} ship five feet above the main battery deck, and caused a number of small fires. The second shell penetrated the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four propellant charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into the turret and down to the magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place after the explosion at Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in <b>the</b> <b>blaze.</b>|$|E
