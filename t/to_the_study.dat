5|$|Dental anatomy is a {{field of}} anatomy {{dedicated}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> of tooth structure.

This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{systems are}} studied at several {{different}} levels, from {{the scale of}} the ecology of individual organisms, to those of populations, to the ecosystems and finally the biosphere. The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology, although population biology is more frequently used in the case of diseases, viruses, and microbes, while the term population ecology is more commonly applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> of plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.|$|E

5|$|Franklin {{was first}} {{attracted}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> of electricity {{when he saw}} the showman Archibald Spencer do magic demonstrations in Boston (1743) and in Philadelphia (1744). He purchased Spencer's equipment and used it for his electricity experiments after these demonstrations were completed. He referred to Spencer as Dr. Spence from Scotland. In 1746, at the age of forty years, Franklin began turning over the affairs of his printing company to his business partner David Hall, and went into semi-retirement so he could carry out research on electricity; initially using Spencer's equipment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, working in Hanford and Savannah River Sites, Reines and Cowan {{developed}} {{the equipment and}} procedures with which they first detected the supposedly undetectable neutrinos in June 1956.

This included the detection of neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays, and the 1987 detection of neutrinos emitted from Supernova SN1987A, which inaugurated the field of neutrino astronomy.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper <b>studied</b> <b>the</b> {{borehole}} {{stability in}} Liulin bituminous core reservoirs during under-balanced drilling.

Core strength experiments combined with logging data {{were used in}} the establishment of core strength predicting model. Mechanics analysis model was founded <b>to</b> <b>study</b> <b>the</b> borehole stability in the core reservoir. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>studying</b> and analyzing results, the under-balance drilling in Liulin coal reservoirs enjoys good borehole stability...|$|R
