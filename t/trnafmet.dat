50|$|In {{bacteria}} and organelles, {{the initiation of}} protein synthesis is signaled by the formation of formyl-methionyl-tRNA (<b>tRNAfMet).</b> This reaction is dependent on 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, and the enzyme methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase.This reaction is not used by eukaryotes or Archaea, {{as the presence of}} <b>tRNAfMet</b> in non bacterial cells is dubbed as intrusive material and quickly eliminated. After its production, <b>tRNAfMet</b> is delivered to the 30S subunit of the ribosome in order to start protein synthesis. fMet possesses the same codon sequence as methionine. However, fMet is only used for the initiation of protein synthesis and is thus found only at the N terminus of the protein. Methionine is used in during the rest translation. In E. coli, <b>tRNAfMet</b> is specifically recognized by initiation factor IF-2, as the formyl group blocks peptide bond formation at the N-terminus of methionine.|$|E

50|$|Two {{proteins}} {{have been}} found to interact with protein C8orf58, CENPH and metG1, which were found using two hybrid assay and the two hybrid pooling approach respectively. CENPH (Centromere Protein H) plays a critical role in centromere structure, kinetochore formation, and sister chromatid separation.

5000|$|... fMet is a {{starting}} residue in {{the synthesis of}} proteins in bacteria, and, consequently, {{is located at the}} N-terminus of the growing polypeptide. fMet is delivered to the ribosome (30S) - mRNA complex by a specialized tRNA (<b>tRNAfMet)</b> which has a 3'-UAC-5' anticodon that is capable of binding with the 5'-AUG-3' start codon located on the mRNA. fMet is thus coded by the same codon as methionine; however, AUG is also the translation initiation codon. When the codon is used for initiation, fMet is used instead of methionine, thereby forming the first amino acid as the peptide chain is synthesized. When the same codon appears later in the mRNA, normal methionine is used. Many organisms use variations of this basic mechanism.|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the initiator tRNA (<b>tRNA(fMet))</b> selection in the ribosomal P-site {{is central to the}} fidelity of protein synthesis. A highly conserved occurrence of three consecutive G-C base pairs in the anticodon stem of <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> contributes to its preferential selection in the P-site. In a genetic screen, using a plasmid borne copy of an inactive <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> mutant wherein the three G-C base pairs were changed, we isolated Escherichia coli strains that allow efficient initiation with the <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> mutant. Here, extensive characterization of two such strains revealed novel mutations in the metZWV promoter severely compromising <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> levels. Low cellular abundance of the chromosomally encoded <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> allows efficient initiation with the <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> mutant and an elongator tRNA(Gln), revealing that a high abundance of the cellular <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> is crucial for the fidelity of initiator tRNA selection on the ribosomal P-site in E. coli.

40|$|Derivatives of E. coli <b>tRNAfMet</b> {{containing}} single base substitutions at the wobble {{position of}} the anticodon have been enzymatically synthesized in vitro. The procedure involves excision of the normal anticodon, CAU, by limited digestion of intact <b>tRNAfMet</b> with RNase A. RNA ligase is then used to join each of four trinucleotides, NAU, to the 5 ' half molecule and to subsequently link the 3 ' and modified 5 ' fragments to regenerate the anticodon loop. Synthesis of intact <b>tRNAfMet</b> containing the anticodon CAU by this procedure yields a product which is indistinguishable from native <b>tRNAfMet</b> with respect to its ability to be aminoacylated by E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase. Substitution of any other nucleotide at the wobble position of <b>tRNAfMet</b> drastically impairs {{the ability of the}} synthetase to recognize the tRNA. Measurement of methionine acceptance in the presence of high concentrations of pure enzyme has established that the rate of aminoacylation of the AAU, GAU and UAU anticodon derivatives of <b>tRNAfMet</b> is four to five orders of magnitude slower than that of the native or synthesized tRNA containing C as the wobble base. In addition, the inactive tRNA derivatives fail to inhibit aminoacylation of normal <b>tRNAfMet,</b> indicating that they bind poorly to the enzyme. These results support a model involving direct interaction between Met-tRNA synthetase and the C in the wobble position during aminoacylation of <b>tRNAfMet...</b>|$|E

40|$|Initiator tRNAs {{are special}} in their direct binding to the ribosomal P-site {{due to the}} {{hallmark}} occurrence of the three consecutive G-C base pairs (3 GC pairs) in their anticodon stems. How the 3 GC pairs function in this role, has remained unsolved. We show that mutations in either the mRNA or 16 S rRNA leading to extended interaction between the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) and anti-SD sequences compensate for the vital need of the 3 GC pairs in <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> for its function in Escherichia coli. In vivo, the 3 GC mutant <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> occurred less abundantly in 70 S ribosomes but normally on 30 S subunits. However, the extended SD:anti-SD interaction increased its occurrence in 70 S ribosomes. We propose that the 3 GC pairs {{play a critical role}} in <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> retention in ribosome during the conformational changes that mark the transition of 30 S preinitiation complex into elongation competent 70 S complex. Furthermore, treating cells with kasugamycin, decreasing ribosome recycling factor (RRF) activity or increasing initiation factor 2 (IF 2) levels enhanced initiation with the 3 GC mutant <b>tRNA(fMet),</b> suggesting that the 70 S mode of initiation is less dependent on the 3 GC pairs in <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|A {{partially}} purified tRNA methylase fraction from rat liver, containing m 2 G- m 1 A- and m 5 C-methylase, {{was used}} to study the influence of Mg++ and of the biogenic polyamine cadaverine on the enzymatic methylation of E. coli tRNAfMetin vitro. In presence of 1 or 10 mM Mg++, guanosine no. 27 was methylated to m 2 G. In 1 mM Mg++ plus 30 mM cadaverine, guanosine in position 27 and adenosine in position 59 were methylated. In presence of 30 mM cadaverine alone <b>tRNAfMet</b> accepted three methyl groups: in addition to guanosine no. 27 and adenosine no. 59 cytidine no. 49 was methylated. In order to correlate <b>tRNAfMet</b> tertiary structure changes with the methylation patterns, differentiated melting curves of <b>tRNAfMet</b> were measured under the methylation conditions. It was shown that the thermodynamic stability of <b>tRNAfMet</b> tertiary structure is different in presence of Mg++, or Mg++ plus cadaverine, or cadaverine alone. From the differentiated melting curves and from the methylation experiments one can conclude that at 37 ° {{in the presence of}} Mg++ <b>tRNAfMet</b> has a compact structure with the extra loop and the TψC-loop protected by tertiary structure interactions. In Mg++ plus cadaverine, the TψC-loop is available, while the extra loop is yet engaged in teritary structure (G- 15 : C- 49) interactions. In cadaverine alone, the TψC-loop and the extra loop are free; hence under these conditions the open <b>tRNAfMet</b> clover leaf may be the substrate for methylation. In general, cadaverine destabilizes tRNA tertiary structure in the presence of Mg++, and stabilizes <b>tRNAfMet</b> tertiary structure in the absence of Mg++. This may be explained by a competition of cadaverine with Mg++ for specific binding sites on the tRNA. On the basis of these experiments a possible role of biogenic polyamines in vivo may be discussed: as essential components of procaryotic and eucaryotic ribosomes they may together with ribosomal factors facilitate tRNA-ribosome binding during protein biosynthesis by opening the tRNA tertiary structure, thus making the tRNA's TψC-loop available for interaction with the complementary sequence of the ribosomal 5 S RNA...|$|E
40|$|In bacteria, {{the free}} amino {{group of the}} methionylated {{initiator}} tRNA is specifically modified {{by the addition of}} a formyl group. The functional relevance of such a formylation for the initiation of translation is not yet precisely understood. Advantage was taken here of the availability of the fmt gene, encoding the Escherichia coli Met-tRNA(fMet) formyltransferase, to measure the influence of variations in the level of formyltransferase activity on the involvement of various mutant <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> and tRNA(mMet) species in either initiation or elongation in vivo. The data obtained established that formylation plays a dual role, firstly, by dictating <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> to engage in the initiation of translation, and secondly, by preventing the misappropriation of this tRNA by the elongation apparatus. The importance of formylation in the initiator identity of <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> was further shown by the demonstration that elongator <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> may be used in initiation and no longer in elongation, provided that it is mutated into a formylatable species and is given the three G.

40|$|A new {{chemical}} method for radioactive labeling of single-stranded regions of RNA {{has been used}} to probe the three-dimensional structure of E. coli <b>tRNAfMet</b> in solution. The procedure involves conversion of cytosine residues to N 4 -[14 C]methylcytosines by treatment with 14 CH 3 NH 2 and sodium bisulfite at pH 7. Ribonuclease digestion of the modified tRNA produces 14 C-labeled oligonucleotides which comigrate with the corresponding unlabeled oligonucleotides, facilitating structural analysis. By this procedure, E. coli <b>tRNAfMet</b> has been found to contain only six reactive cytosines: C 1, C 16, C 17, C 35, C 75 and C 76. In addition, slow reaction at Cm 33 was observed. These results are in excellent agreement with previously reported data on the sites of exposed cytosine residues in <b>tRNAfMet</b> obtained by two other {{chemical method}}s. The methylamine-bisulfite procedure is recommended for studying the ordered structure of more complex polyribonucleotides such as viral and ribosomal RNAs...|$|E
40|$|Transfer RNA (tRNA) {{molecules}} {{have been}} labeled with 32 P at the 5 ' end {{and subjected to}} S 1 nuclease digestion. The products were analyzed by high-resolution gel electrophoresis. Three initiator tRNAs and six chain-elongating tRNAs were examined. S 1 nuclease cleaved Escherichia coli <b>tRNAfMet,</b> yeast <b>tRNAfMet,</b> and mammalian <b>tRNAfMet</b> at the same two positions in the anticodon loop. In contrast, S 1 nuclease cleaved the anticodon loop of E. coli tRNAmMet, yeast tRNAmMet, yeast tRNAPhe, Schizosaccharomyces pombe tRNAPhe, E. coli tRNA 2 Glu, and E. coli tRNATrp (su+) at four positions generally, except where a modified nucleotide in the wobble position inhibited the enzyme. The marked contrast between these cleavage patterns suggests a different conformation for the anticodon loops of these two classes of tRNA molecules.

40|$|The ribosomal protein S 4 is a {{translational}} repressor {{that binds}} {{to a complex}} mRNA pseudoknot structure containing the ribosome binding site for the first gene of the alpha operon. Either 30 S subunits or S 4 protein bound to the mRNA causes Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase to pause near the 3 ' terminus of the pseudoknot. There is no competition between subunits and S 4 for mRNA binding. The kinetics of forming S 4 - 30 S-mRNA complexes are biphasic, and the fraction of mRNA molecules reacting more rapidly decreases as the temperature is increased from 30 degrees C to 40 degrees C.

Thus the two sets of experiments show that there are two forms of 30 S-mRNA complexes that differ in their abilities to bind S 4 and <b>tRNA(fMet).</b> The results support an allosteric model for translational repression in which S 4 traps the mRNA in a conformation able to bind 30 S subunits but unable to form an initiation complex with <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{work from}} our {{laboratory}} identified several specific sites in Escherichia coli <b>tRNAfMet</b> {{that are essential}} for recognition of this tRNA by E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase (EC 6. 1. 1. 10). Particularly strong evidence indicated a role for the nucleotide base at the wobble position of the anticodon in the discrimination process. To further investigate the structural requirements for recognition in this region, we have synthesized a series of <b>tRNAfMet</b> derivatives containing single base changes in each position of the anticodon. In addition, derivatives containing permuted sequences and larger and smaller anticodon loops have been prepared. The variant tRNAs have been enzymatically synthesized in vitro. The procedure involves excision of the normal anticodon, CAU, by limited digestion of intact <b>tRNAfMet</b> with pancreatic RNase. This step also removes two nucleotides from the 3 ' CpCpA end. T 4 RNA ligase is used to join oligonucleotides of defined length and sequence to the 5 ' half-molecule and subsequently to link the 3 ' and modified 5 ' fragment to regenerate the anticodon loop. The final step of the synthesis involves repair of the 3 ' terminus with tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. The synthetic derivative containing the anticodon CAU is aminoacylated with the same kinetics as intact <b>tRNAfMet.</b> Base substitutions in the wobble position reduce aminoacylation rates by at least five orders of magnitude. The rates of aminoacylation of derivatives having base substitutions {{in the other two}} positions of the anticodon are 1 / 55 to 1 / 18, 500 times normal. Nucleotides that have specific functional groups in common with the normal anticodon bases are better tolerated at each of these positions than those that do not. A <b>tRNAfMet</b> variant having a six-membered loop containing only the CA sequence of the anticodon is aminoacylated still more slowly, and a derivative containing a five-membered loop is not measurably active. The normal loop size can be increased by one nucleotide with a relatively small effect on the rate of aminoacylation, indicating that the spatial arrangement of the nucleotides is less critical than their chemical nature. We conclude from these data that recognition of <b>tRNAfMet</b> requires highly specific interactions of methionyl-tRNA synthetase with functional groups on the nucleotide bases of the anticodon sequence...|$|E

The ultraviolet light-induced inactivation of methionine acceptance by <b>tRNAfMet</b> is due almost entirely to modification of the cytidine residues in the 3 ′-terminal CCA—OH sequence...|$|E

E. coli transformylase however, does not formylate the yeast mitochondrial initiator tRNA. The sequence was determined using both 32 P-in vivo labeled and 32 P-end labeled mt <b>tRNAf(Met).</b> This tRNA, unlike N. crassa mitochondrial <b>tRNAf(Met),</b> has two structural features typical of procaryotic initiator tRNAs: (i) it lacks a Watson-Crick base-pair {{at the end of}} the acceptor stem and (ii) has a T-psi-C-A sequence in loop IV. However, both yeast and N. crassa mitochondrial initiator tRNAs have a U 11 :A 24 base-pair in the D-stem unlike procaryotic initiator tRNAs which have A 11 :U 24.

Two such sequences (FP 1 and FP 2) are present upstream of the <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> -RNAse P RNA -tRNA(Pro) gene cluster but only the FP 1 promoter but not the FP 2 appears to be active in vivo and in vitro. The results presented in this paper suggest that the downstream ATTAATT sequence close to the initiation site of FP 2 causes premature termination of transcription and effectively inhibits transcription from the FP 2 octanucleotide sequence. Thus the different levels of RNA synthesis from these <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> promoters might be determined by variable transcriptional initiation and elongation blockage events. Since FP 1 is found to be the only active promoter in this gene cluster, these three genes are thought to be transcribed together from the FP 1 promoter.

Although RsmB deficiency did not impact initiation from most codons, RsmD deficiency increased initiation from AUA, CAC and CAU (2 - to 3. 6 -fold). Deletion of the S 9 C-terminal tail resulted in poorer initiation from UUG, GUG and CUG, but in increased initiation from CAC, CAU and UAC codons (up to 4 -fold).

40|$|Previous work by Schulman and Pelka (1975) J. Biol.

In the present study, the structural requirements for the sensitivity of an N-acetyl-aminoacyl-tRNA to Escherichia coli peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase activity have been further investigated. Ten derivatives of <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> with various combinations of bases at positions 1 and 72 in the acceptor stem have been produced, aminoacylated and chemically acetylated. The release of the aminoacyl moiety from these tRNA derivatives was assayed in the presence of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase purified from an overproducing strain. <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> derivatives with either C 1 A 72, C 1 C 72, U 1 G 72, U 1 C 72 or A 1 C 72 behaved as poor substrates of the enzyme, as compared to those with C 1 G 72, U 1 A 72, G 1 C 72, A 1 U 72 or G 1 U 72. With the exception of U 1 G 72, it could be therefore concluded that the relative resistance of <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> to peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase did not depend on a particular combination of nucleotides at positions 1 and 72, but rather reflected the absence of a base pairing at these positions. In a second series of experiments, the unpairing of the 1 and 72 bases, created with C-A or A-C bases, instead of G-C in methionyl-tRNA(mMet) or in valyl-tRNA(Val 1), was shown to markedly decrease the rate of hydrolysis catalysed by peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase.

The RNase activity assay using yeast RNA or <b>tRNAfMet</b> as substrate showed that the synthetic peptide SSR(1 – 62) did not hydrolyze yeast RNA or <b>tRNAfMet.</b> These data were not consistent with previous reports that both the native peptide isolated from S. solfataricus [Fusi et al.

In the presence of synthetic SSR(1 – 62), the cleavage of DNA (plasmid pUCRh 2 - 4) by restriction endonuclease (EcoRI) was not observed, suggesting that synthetic SSR(1 – 62) bound to DNA protected DNA from its enzymatic digestion. Neither SSR(1 – 22) nor SSR(10 – 62) prevented DNA from being cleaved by a restriction enzyme.

40|$|A protein {{affinity}} labeling {{derivative of}} E. coli <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> carrying lysine-reactive cross-linking groups has been covalently coupled to monomeric trypsin-modified E. coli methionyl-tRNA synthetase. The cross-linked tRNA-synthetase complex has been isolated by gel filtration, digested with trypsin, and the tRNA-bound peptides {{separated from the}} bulk of the free tryptic peptides by anion exchange chromatography. The bound peptides were released from the tRNA by cleavage of the disulfide bond of the cross-linker and purified by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, yielding three major peptides. These peptides were found to cochromatograph with three peptides of known sequence previously cross-linked to native methionyl-tRNA synthetase through lysine residues 402, 439 and 465. These results show that identical lysine residues are in close proximity to <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> bound to native dimeric methionyl-tRNA synthetase and to the crystallizable monomeric form of the enzyme, and indicate that cross-linking to the dimeric protein occurs on the occupied subunit of the 1 : 1 tRNA-synthetase complex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAcceptor stem {{variants}} of <b>tRNAfMet</b> (Escherichia coli) have {{been characterized by}} nuclear magnetic resonance. The wild type contains a C 1 -A 72 mismatch pair which is crucial for its biological function. For comparison, the mismatch was replaced by regular pairs U 1 -A 72 and C 1 -G 72. Further variants contain an altered discriminator base, G 73, or a G 1 -C 72 /U 73 combination. The stems of variants U 1 -A 72 /A 73 and C 1 -G 72 /A 73 have A-RNA geometry, which extends essentially to the single-strand terminus. C 1 -A 72 /G 73 variant and wild type are structurally almost identical. C 1 and A 72 adopt peculiar conformations with C 1 being largely destacked with respect to G 2, while A 73 stacks upon C 1. The unique arrangement of the mismatch causes a distinctly different orientation of the single-strand terminus compared to variants with regular 1 – 72 base pairs, and to formyltransferase-complexed <b>tRNAfMet...</b>|$|E
40|$|Translation {{initiation}} {{from the}} ribosomal P-site is the specialty of the initiator tRNAs (<b>tRNA(fMet)).</b> Presence {{of the three}} consecutive G-C base pairs (G 29 -C 41, G 30 -C 40 and G 31 -C 39) in their anticodon stems, a highly conserved feature of the initiator tRNAs across the three kingdoms of life, has been implicated in their preferential binding to the P-site. How this feature is exploited by ribosomes has remained unclear. Using a genetic screen, we have isolated an Escherichia coli strain, carrying a G 122 D mutation in folD, which allows initiation with the <b>tRNA(fMet)</b> containing mutations in one, two or all the three G-C base pairs. The strain shows a severe deficiency of methionine and S-adenosylmethionine, and lacks nucleoside methylations in rRNA. Targeted mutations in the methyltransferase genes have revealed {{a connection between the}} rRNA modifications and the fundamental process of the initiator tRNA selection by the ribosome...|$|E
40|$|Transamination with bifunctional amines in the {{presence}} of bisulfite has been used to attach side chains of variable length to the N 4 -position of single stranded cytidine residues in E. coli <b>tRNAfMet.</b> Such side chains, terminating in reactive primary amino groups, have been coupled to a variety of N-hydroxysuccinimide esters. The resulting modified tRNAs carry protein affinity labeling groups capable of covalent reaction with a variety of amino acids...|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequences of}} tobacco chloroplast genes for tRNAPro(UGG), tRNATrp, <b>tRNAfMet</b> and tRNAGly(GCC) have been determined. None of these genes contains an intron. One unusual feature {{is that the}} tRNAGly contains only two base-pairs (A-U, G-U) in the D stem. These four tRNA genes were located in the known physical map of tobacco chloroplast DNA. Hybridization analysis to chloroplast tRNA revealed that all four tRNA genes are transcribed in vivo...|$|E
