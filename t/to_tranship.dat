2500|$|The Huddersfield Narrow Canal {{provided}} a heavily-locked western {{connection to the}} wool-weaving towns of the upper Colne valley, (Golcar, Linthwaite, Slaithwaite, and Marsden) and across the Pennines to Saddleworth, Stalybridge and Manchester via Standedge Tunnel. It was never particularly successful, and Ramsden's Canal was seen almost as {{a branch of the}} Calder and Hebble, with links to Yorkshire, rather than Lancashire. The Calder and Hebble brought prosperity to the area, and Ramsden's Canal shared in it. The Narrow Canal was hampered by the need <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> cargoes at Huddersfield. Their boats were , the same as those on the connecting Ashton Canal and Peak Forest Canal at the Manchester end. However, they were too long to fit through the shorter locks of Ramsden's Canal and the Calder and Hebble. In 1812 they built a [...] narrowboat, which could work through to Wakefield, but it carried a smaller cargo. The company tried unsuccessfully to get the Calder and Hebble to entend their locks to cater for longer boats. Had they succeeded, locks on Ramsden's Canal would have needed lengthening.|$|E
60|$|For {{this was}} only a beginning. He had got into {{communication}} with the various companies which took surgeons out on their ships, and knew exactly what were their routes, and from {{men who had been}} on them what were {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each line. He put aside the Orient and the P. & O. It was difficult to get a berth with them; and besides their passenger traffic allowed the medical officer little freedom; but there were other services which sent large tramps on leisurely expeditions to the East, stopping at all sorts of ports for various periods, from a day or two to a fortnight, so that you had plenty of time, and it was often possible to make a trip inland. The pay was poor and the food no more than adequate, so that there was not much demand for the posts, and a man with a London degree was pretty sure to get one if he applied. Since there were no passengers other than a casual man or so, shipping on business from some out-of-the-way port to another, the life on board was friendly and pleasant. Philip knew by heart the list of places at which they touched; and each one called up in him visions of tropical sunshine, and magic colour, and of a teeming, mysterious, intense life. Life! That was what he wanted. At last he would come to close quarters with Life. And perhaps, from Tokyo or Shanghai it would be possible <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> into some other line and drip down to the islands of the South Pacific. A doctor was useful anywhere. There might be an opportunity to go up country in Burmah, and what rich jungles in Sumatra or Borneo might he not visit? He was young still and time was no object to him. He had no ties in England, no friends; he could go up and down the world for years, learning the beauty and the wonder and the variedness of life.|$|E

50|$|Technical {{solutions}} <b>to</b> avoid <b>transhipping</b> include {{variable gauge}} axles, replacing the bogies of cars, and using transporter cars that {{can carry a}} car of a different gauge.|$|R
500|$|On {{the upper}} section, the final pond {{prevented}} the proper drainage {{of the surrounding}} land, which being composed of peat, started to swell. This caused the canal itself to rise and the clay puddling to fracture, resulting in further loss of water, and a reduced depth for navigation. Traffic had <b>to</b> be <b>transhipped</b> <b>to</b> smaller boats at Highbridge, which added to the costs of delivery. Receipts for 1848 were £300, which would indicate that the canal was probably only carrying about [...] per annum.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1860 and 1863 some Lytton {{township}} allotments were alienated, {{mostly by}} Brisbane speculators who anticipated {{the development of}} wharf facilities at Lytton. Few private buildings were erected there. The Crown and Anchor Hotel at Lytton held a license in 1865-66 - about the time a government wharf adjacent to the Customs Reserve was built in 1866 <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> railway stores and plant. From 1878 until [...] the Lytton Hotel served local farmers and the annual military presence.|$|E
50|$|Thanks to {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Adrianoupolis (Edirne), September 2, 1829, that {{unfettered}} the Danube grain trade, Sulina, by then under Russian control, became important. Great sailing boats could not sail fully loaded to Brăila and Galaţi, which were the main export centres of Wallachia and Moldavia, because of the shallow waters of the river; therefore, they had <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> at least part of their cargoes to smaller riverboats (shleps). The owners and crew of these sleps were almost always Greek.|$|E
50|$|Advenza was {{scheduled}} to commence operating between Barking, Essex (Roadways Limited's sidings) and Deanside Glasgow (John G Russell) in April 2004, using trains of containers which would be trans-shipped from rail to the respective operator depots <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> pallet load freight. This was using three cycles a week, north bound Monday-Wednesday-Friday, and southbound Tuesday-Thursday-Saturday. However, due to uncertainties with the provision of locomotives {{and the fact that}} the supporting systems were not yet in place even though all the drivers had been route-trained, the launch was postponed.|$|E
50|$|Through {{operation}} between railway networks {{with different}} gauges was originally impossible; goods had <b>to</b> be <b>transhipped</b> and passengers {{had to change}} trains. This was obviously a major obstacle to convenient transport, and in Great Britain, led to political intervention.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{there was}} no direct {{transfer}} traffic with the state railway, all freight had <b>to</b> be <b>transhipped.</b> Transfer between the systems became possible in 1902. The line had 22 railway sidings {{with a total of}} 13.59 km of track in 1934.|$|R
25|$|On 18 March an LST ramp {{opened at}} the base {{allowing}} supplies <b>to</b> be <b>transhipped</b> on LCUs and LCMs to Đông Hà. A petroleum, oil & lubricants (POL) facility was also established at the base, protected by a company from the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{sections}} of Lytton township were alienated between 1860 and 1863, mostly by Brisbane speculators who anticipated {{the development of}} wharf facilities at Lytton. Few private buildings were erected there. The Crown and Anchor Hotel operated at Lytton briefly in 1865-66, when a government wharf adjacent to the Customs Reserve was built in 1866 <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> railway stores and plant for construction of the Southern and Western Railway. From 1878 until [...] the Lytton Hotel served local farmers and a military presence. Lytton State School was established [...] In general, the district remained agricultural.|$|E
50|$|The Houthaven was dug out in 1876, {{together}} with the North Sea Canal. It was the first port in Amsterdam to be dug out (the earlier ones using existing waters). Its purpose was <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> and store lumber. As lumber was increasingly transported by road, parts of the port were filled up with sand {{to be used for}} other purposes in 1945. The Minervahaven remained in use for lumber transhipment and wood processing industry was located there but port-related activities decreased strongly over time. The area is currently being redeveloped.|$|E
50|$|Around {{the start}} of the 19th century, two new towns were constructed: Milford in 1790 by Sir William Hamilton, and Pembroke Dock in 1802 as the site for a new Royal Naval Dockyard. Both towns have regular planned layouts, both have {{experienced}} a history of boom and slump in shipbuilding, fishing and as railheads and ocean terminals. These two towns, which could handle the larger vessels then entering service, concentrated trade that had previously been dispersed at quays, jetties and landing places and small settlements such as Pennar, Lawrenny, Landshipping and Cosheston further up river. These small ports served the coal mines of the Pembrokeshire Coalfield located on both shores of the Daugleddau, and also the large limestone quarries at West Williamston. The Daugleddau ports flourished in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, but continued to work through the 19th century by changing to using barges <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> cargoes down river to bigger vessels at the mid-Haven ports.|$|E
50|$|The Brighton - Shoreham branch was {{completed}} in May 1840, before the main line, as {{there were no significant}} civil engineering works on this section. Locomotives and rolling stock had <b>to</b> be <b>transhipped</b> by road for what was, in the first year, an isolated stretch of railway.|$|R
5000|$|In freight rail transport, {{interchange}} is {{the practice}} of railroads conveying freight cars ("foreign" [...] cars) from other companies over their lines. This benefits shippers, whose cargo might otherwise have <b>to</b> be <b>transhipped</b> if the point of origin and destination are not both served by the same company.|$|R
50|$|Few {{of these}} {{original}} buildings are left but examples still standing are the Stafford Warehouse {{on the main}} canal, which has now been converted into apartments, and Stitt's Warehouse on the Runcorn arm which is now a commercial building. The business activities in Preston Brook were encouraged by the opening in 1837 of the railway with a passenger station and a goods yard to allow materials <b>to</b> be <b>transhipped</b> <b>to</b> and from the canal. It {{was not until the}} third quarter of the 19th Century that canal traffic declined as the railway network spread throughout the country. The passenger station was closed on 1 March 1948, and the Goods Depot on 1st. September 1958.|$|R
50|$|The {{line between}} Altenglan and Rammelsbach was {{changed since the}} Rammelsbach tunnel had proved to be too narrow for freight trains. This meant that it was often {{necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> freight to Kusel from wagon to wagon. The new line opened in 1936 ran around the Remigiusberg (hill) instead. In the same year an extension was completed from Kusel to Türkismühle for strategic reasons, yet {{for the time being}} no through trains ran between Altenglan and Türkismühle. Due to the dissolution of the Reichsbahndirektion (railway administration of) Ludwigshafen and the division of the Glan Valley Railway between the Reichsbahndirektion Mainz (immediately north of the station) and the Reichsbahndirektion Saarbrücken (from Homburg to Altenglan), the track supervisor’s office (Bahnmeisterei) of Altenglan, which had existed since 1904, was closed in 1937. Between 24 and 27 September 1938, a military exercise was held in the Palatinate. Troop trains from Frankfurt were despatched to stations including, among others, Altenglan.|$|E

It was never particularly successful, and Ramsden's Canal was seen almost as {{a branch of the}} Calder and Hebble, with links to Yorkshire, rather than Lancashire. The Calder and Hebble brought prosperity to the area, and Ramsden's Canal shared in it. The Narrow Canal was hampered by the need <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> cargoes at Huddersfield. Their boats were 70 by 7 ft, the same as those on the connecting Ashton Canal and Peak Forest Canal at the Manchester end. However, they were too long to fit through the shorter locks of Ramsden's Canal and the Calder and Hebble. In 1812 they built a 57.5 ft narrowboat, which could work through to Wakefield, but it carried a smaller cargo. The company tried unsuccessfully to get the Calder and Hebble to entend their locks to cater for longer boats. Had they succeeded, locks on Ramsden's Canal would have needed lengthening.|$|E
50|$|With {{construction}} of the Lancaster Canal starting in 1792, thought was given to a connection {{between it and the}} sea, and John Rennie's plans for a Glasson branch formed the basis for an Act of Parliament which was obtained in May 1793. No work took place, and it was not until 1819 that the plans were revived, when another Act of Parliament was needed to raise additional finance. The estimated cost of the branch was £34,608, and work began in 1823. The 2.5 mi branch dropped through 52 ft from Galgate, and the basic engineering was completed in December 1825, but financial difficulties meant that warehousing and wharves could not be constructed at first, and so the build-up of trade was slow. However, by 1830 over 10,000 tons of goods passed through the dock, most of it passing on to the canal. Because the locks were 14 ft wide, smaller ships did not have <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> their cargoes to canal boats, as they could sail through the dock and along the canal. The first such boat to do so was a schooner called Sprightly, which carried slate to Preston in May 1826. Incoming trade included slate, timber, potatoes and grain, while coal was exported through the port to Ulverston, North Wales and Ireland.|$|E
50|$|Rail {{travel from}} Penzance to London was {{possible}} from 1860 when the West Cornwall company was {{given access to}} the Cornwall Railway’s Truro station, but the West Cornwall trains were standard gauge and the Cornwall Railway was broad gauge, so through passengers had to change trains there and goods had <b>to</b> be <b>transhipped</b> into wagons of the other gauge at Truro.|$|R
50|$|The mine is {{connected}} by a 140 km 1435mm gauge railway to the junction at Dabola, where ore is <b>transhipped</b> <b>to</b> 1000mm gauge wagons {{for the rest of}} the journey to the port. This branch line was completed in 1998.|$|R
5000|$|The {{considerable}} {{height difference}} between Nanpantan and Loughborough {{would have required}} a number of locks, for which {{there was not enough}} water, so the canal terminated at Nanpantan where goods had <b>to</b> be <b>transhipped</b> onto a horse-drawn wagonway which connected to Loughborough wharf. The tramway was engineered by William Jessop who used an iron edge-rail railway, in contrast to his partner Benjamin Outram, who, for other such lines, preferred the traditional iron [...] "L" [...] shaped flange-rail plateway.|$|R
5000|$|The dock was {{constructed}} for boats using the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Aire and Calder Navigation <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> goods and commodities from Leeds city centre in 1843. It was primarily {{used to bring}} coal from collieries around Rothwell and Wakefield to supply heavy industries in Hunslet and business and commerce in Leeds city centre. The {{western side of the}} dock once had a large crane on tracks {{along the side of the}} dock to load and unload goods from canal barges. In the 1990s the surrounding area was made up of Victorian industrial buildings most of which were derelict. Throughout the second half of the 20th century the area suffered steady industrial decline. The mills and many heavy engineering works began to close, move further out of town or scale down. The docks survived Victorian canal decline after the introduction of rail freight but the move to road freight in the 20th century killed trade. Construction of the £42.5m purpose-built Royal Armouries Museum marked the start of the area's redevelopment which opened in March 1996. No further development was made until 2004 when a multi-storey car park opened followed by an Express hotel in August 2006. The retail and leisure sector was launched on 11 October 2008 with fashion shows from celebrity fashion consultant and TV presenter Gok Wan. However few retail chains were attracted to the area and the site failed to take off as a shopping centre. The site, which had been known as Clarence Dock, became New Dock in mid-2012 as part of a re-branding initiative. The site was bought by Allied London, and rebranded as Leeds Dock in 2013.|$|E
50|$|In 1921 the Federal Royal Commission into Standard Gauge had {{recommended}} that the mainland States of Australia and the Australian Government commit themselves to providing a uniform railway network linking the capital cities of Australia with a common gauge. As part of the standardisation of the disparate gauges, a new link between Sydney and Brisbane via Kyogle, New South Wales was identified as being a central element. Queensland in 1924 passed the South Brisbane Kyogle Grafton Act committing itself {{to the construction of}} a new standard gauge railway from South Brisbane railway station to the border with New South Wales. As part of this, New South Wales demanded a bridge over the Clarence River at Grafton and the upgrading of the Kyogle branch. The Australian Government provided half the funding for the project. The interstate standard gauge railway line between Kyogle and South Brisbane opened in 1930. The importance of the Toowoomba-Wallangarra southern line diminished, as the new link via northern New South Wales and the Richmond Gap into Queensland did not involve a change of trains at a border station.During the time of the Second World War the strategic importance of Wallangarra was vital in providing an inland transhipment and staging point during the defence of Australia. Large numbers of workers were employed <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> goods in the New South Wales section of the yard. The extensive yard and station complex at this time consisted of the station building, closets and horse dock at the southern end of the station platform (the border dock). Refreshment Room staff and ambulance quarters were situated at the north end of the platform. On the western (Queensland) side was a goods office, casual crew quarters with dining room, frame tent and library. To the north-east an engine shed was situated, reserve coal dump, locomotive coal stage, tool room, ASM's residence (1919), ganger's residence (1919) and trucking yards. On the east side (New South Wales) was the Station Master's residence (1887), 25 ton weighbridge, lamp room, waitresses quarters and the footwarmer furnace. Quarters were also provided for laundresses. Most of these ancillary buildings are now removed.|$|E
40|$|When {{point-to-point}} markets cannot support direct {{service in}} the container trade, shipping lines need {{to make decisions about}} transhipment locations. Where <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> is, at the start, a geographical question. This paper reviews a few of the geographer's descriptive, analytical and conceptual tools, which can be usefully applied to the transhipment phenomenon. The map, to begin with, draws out certain obvious locational relationships. Network analysis, using graph theoretical models, can suggest efficient ways of building and serving a transport network. The geographer's concepts of site, situation, and strategic location provide a general framework for comparative analysis of transhipment locations. The case of Freeport, a developing transhipment centre in the Bahamas, will be used to illustrate the application of these geographical tools.

5000|$|The next section, Paremata to Paekakariki, proved {{difficult}} - {{it included}} six tunnels built against a steep cliff face, {{and a large}} swamp outside a township {{to be known as}} Plimmerton. Rails reached Pukerua Bay in 1885, where a temporary tramway was constructed below No. 13 tunnel to allow goods and passengers <b>to</b> be <b>transhipped</b> <b>to</b> a stagecoach to Foxton. Material for the construction of the tunnels between Paekakariki and Pukerua Bay were unloaded at a makeshift wharf constructed in Brendan's Bay. Meanwhile, rails were within two miles of Waikanae in the north by 25 September, with a service from Otaki connecting the two railheads. The laying of the line from Pukerua Bay to Paekakariki was completed on 4 October 1886, and on 27 October the lines from Waikanae and Paekakariki met at Otaihanga. The first revenue-earning train, a stock train from Longburn to Johnsonville with 355 sheep and 60 head of cattle, was on 30 October.|$|R

40|$|China, {{once seen}} as a threat by the states of South Asia, is now viewed {{correctly}} as an alternative development opportunity. The unprecedented success of the Chinese development model places it as an obvious alternative to that offered by India—or indeed by the Western model of development—but what implications does this have for the middle and small powers that surround India, and indeed for India and the Western developed world? The fundamental rationale for China’s relations with South Asia has changed radically, but the Sino-centric nature of Chinese foreign policy remains. Uniquely, for India’s neighbours, {{but also for the}} global political economy as a whole, Chinese economic power raises political issues of human security, economic interdependence, and the relationship between physical infrastructure and the benefits of global public goods. The Chinese necessity <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> through South Asia is identified as a complex new reality for the great powe...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} hub ports {{has been more}} {{developed}} since {{the second half of}} the last century due to the rapid increase in the international trade, the vessel getting every time bigger and the necessity of the carrier to reduce the port of calls and consequently, the costs. East Asia is the most blooming area among global hub ports. Most of the shipping lines select ports in the region in order <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> the cargos to feeder vessels. Singapore has retained its post as the biggest hub port in the world and one busiest port in the world during the last years. This work aims to explore how the port achieved this position. Singapore has developed, since its independency in 1965, strategies to encourage shipping lines to use Singapore as transhipment hub, besides the initial factor of favourable location to the main shipping routes...|$|E
40|$|Biomass rail {{transport}} {{is a useful}} alternative to unimodal truck transport for medium or long transport distances, if only a short road pre-haulage is required. Up to now primary forest fuels (PFF) are rarely transported on the rail network in Austria and rail terminals able <b>to</b> <b>tranship</b> notable volumes are not established yet. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the potentials of existing transhipment infrastructure for introducing and operating PFF terminals. Such PFF terminals enable a regular PFF supply to bioenergy plants and additionally provide opportunities for buffer storage and production processes like comminution. Three existing railway sidings in South, Central and Western Austria were chosen to serve as a multimodal transhipment hub with a road pre-haulage and a rail main-haulage for this case study. The logistic potential of these terminals was investigated, modelling the specific PFF supply chains, by means of a discrete event simulation.  Simulation results provide daily and annual transhipment capacities and revealed bottlenecks in the terminal layout under different supply scenarios. </p...|$|E
