6000|$|MAGGIE [not so {{much out}} of the {{goodness}} of her heart as to patronise the Shands]. It seems to me it's a case for us all <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> beds and leave the young man to study; but not on that chair. [And she wheels the chair away from him.] ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{stood and}} looked at them awhile, {{and it must be}} confessed, it was a {{pleasant}} sight enough; but, reflecting immediately that there was no end of this, and that we were only upon the enquiry, Come away, said I, laughing to my men, and do not stand picking up of trash there all day; do you know how far we have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> lodgings? ...|$|E
60|$|We had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> work, but Paddy {{was not to}} {{be buried}} in any such off-hand fashion as that. It was agreed that we should bury him in the orchard at sunset that evening, and Sara Ray, who had to go home, {{declared}} she would be back for it, and implored us to wait for her if she didn't come exactly on time.|$|E

6000|$|... "He and his blasted old ship may hang, for aught I care; {{and until}} we are safely off the thing I shall spend my {{energies}} in looking after our own welfare. And I rather fancy {{the first step to}} that end should be <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> cabin and look over my revolvers. I am sorry now that we packed the larger guns and the ammunition with the stuff below." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{it is that}} we {{must take}} some chances," [...] little Frenchie said when we were about <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> posts of duty. [...] "It may be that the first who appears will be a Tory, and we have no means of {{determining}} his politics.

60|$|DEAR HOWELLS,--You or Aldrich {{or both of}} {{you must}} come to Hartford to live. Mr. Hall, {{who lives in the}} house next to Mrs. Stowe's (just where we drive in <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> new house) will sell for $16,000 or $17,000. The lot is 85 feet front and 150 deep--long time and easy {{payments}} on the purchase? You can do your work just as well here as in Cambridge, can't you? Come, will one of you boys buy that house? Now say yes.|$|E
30|$|In our {{community}} {{the situation was}} worse. Someone reported to us {{the road to the}} public shelter was already flooded. This news was immediately shared by everyone in the community and thus we made a choice <b>to</b> <b>go</b> together <b>to</b> <b>our</b> community center for evacuation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} would be best for us <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> <b>our</b> own country as soon as possible," [...] {{suggested}} Rosalie the Witch, [...] "for if we stay here very long, the Blueskins may rise against us and cause the Pinkies much trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so," [...] said Agatha; [...] "and {{the result}} is that I spend all my time in keeping peace between you. And now, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> <b>our</b> subject, may I ask whether it has ever {{occurred}} to you that no one ever considers me?" ...|$|R
60|$|The moon {{had just}} begun to rise when we {{finished}} our suppers and prepared <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> post of observation. We took our rifles with us of course, for although we did not intend to shoot, having more than sufficient food already in camp, we could not tell but that at any moment those weapons might be required for the defence of our lives. Makarooroo had been too long accustomed to see wild animals to understand the pleasure we enjoyed in merely staring at them, so he was left in charge of our camp.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monday, the 25th, being Christmas Day, we went ashore, some to fell timber, some to saw, some to rive, {{and some}} to carry; and so no man rested all that day. But towards night some, {{as they were}} at work, heard a noise of Indians, which caused us all <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> muskets; but we heard no further, so we came aboard again, leaving some to keep guard. That night we had a sore storm of wind and rain. But at night the ship- master caused us to have some beer aboard." ...|$|E
60|$|The preachers {{heard the}} ‘bruit,’ or rumour of the tragedy, by nine o’clock {{on the morning}} of August 6. By ten o’clock arrived a letter from James to the Privy Council: the preachers were called first ‘before the Council of the town,’ and the King’s epistle was read to them. ‘It bore that his Majesty was {{delivered}} out of a peril, and therefore that we should be commanded <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> Kirks, convene our people, ring bells, and give God praises.’ While the preachers were answering, the Privy Council sent for the Provost and some of the Town Council.|$|E
6000|$|Florac and the Princess {{were both}} in desolation when, at dinner, we {{announced}} <b>our</b> resolution <b>to</b> <b>go</b> away--and <b>to</b> <b>our</b> neighbours at Newcome! that was more extraordinary. [...] "Que diable <b>goest</b> thou <b>to</b> do in this galley?" [...] asks our host as we sat alone over our wine.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{agree with}} Arthur and you," [...] Allan said. [...] "I agree {{with all that}} you have said. The child was dear to me too. So dear, that I {{do not think that}} it would be easy <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> <b>our</b> old life without her. That is why----" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{consulted}} with Rupert Bailey. It {{seemed to me}} that Arthur Jukes was entitled to the verdict. Rupert, who, though an amiable and delightful companion, had always been one of Nature's fat-heads, could not see it. We had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> <b>our</b> principals and announce that we had been unable to agree.|$|R
60|$|On {{the ground}} floor we found {{ourselves}} out of immediate danger, since the fire was attacking {{this part of the}} palace from above and burning downward. We had even time <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> respective sleeping-places and collect such of our possessions and valuables as we were able to carry. Fortunately, among other things, these included all our note-books, which to-day are of priceless value. Laden with these articles, we met again in the audience hall, which, although it was very hot, seemed as it had always been, a huge, empty place, whereof the roof, painted with stars, was supported upon thick cedar columns, each of them hewn from a single tree.|$|E
6000|$|... "A plague on it!" [...] said Blount, as he {{descended the}} stairs; [...] "had {{he sent me}} with a cartel to Leicester I think I should have done his errand indifferently well. But <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> gracious Sovereign, before whom all words must be {{lacquered}} over either with gilding or with sugar, is such a confectionary matter as clean baffles my poor old English brain.--Come with me, Tracy, and come you too, Master Walter Wittypate, that art the cause of our having all this ado. Let us see if thy neat brain, that frames so many flashy fireworks, can help out a plain fellow at need with some of thy shrewd devices." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would you?" [...] he exclaimed, {{his face}} {{lighting}} {{up as he}} glanced at me. [...] "Alas, Madame de St. Gre and I have promised <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> neighbors', Monsieur and Madame Bertrand's, for to-night. But, to-morrow, if you have leisure, we shall look at it together. And not a word of this to my daughter, Monsieur," [...] he added apprehensively; [...] "she would never forgive me. She dislikes my talking of her, but at times I cannot help it. It was only last year {{that she was very}} angry with me, and would not speak to me for days, because I boasted of her having watched at the bedside of a poor gentleman who came here and got the fever. You will not tell her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"He has Rome {{to console}} him," [...] said Pertinax. [...] "I ask {{you of your}} {{kindness}} <b>to</b> let us <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> homes and get this smell out of our nostrils." ...|$|R
5|$|Alicia Borrachero as Queen Prunaprismia. Prunaprismia was Miraz's wife. When she {{had learned}} {{that her husband had}} killed his own brother, she became heartbroken. After Miraz's death, Prunaprismia was the second {{volunteer}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> <b>our</b> world (with her child). Because of her repenting, Prunprismia and her child were promised a good life back in our world.|$|R
60|$|Could this be love?--pure, {{first love}} for a shopkeeper's daughter, whom I had seen {{for a quarter of}} an hour in an omnibus, and {{followed}} home for another quarter of an hour? The thing was impossible. And yet, I felt a strange unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> <b>our</b> house, and see my father and sister, just at that moment.|$|R
60|$|<b>To</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> inner {{office in}} Raggett Street I {{had to walk}} through a room in which the typists worked. They were the {{correspondence}} typists; our books and invoicing had long since overflowed into the premises we had had the luck to secure {{on either side of}} us. I was, I must confess, always in a faintly cloudily-emotional way aware of that collection of for the most part round-shouldered femininity, but presently one of the girls detached herself from the others and got a real hold upon my attention. I appreciated her at first as a straight little back, a neater back than any of the others; as a softly rounded neck with a smiling necklace of sham pearls; as chestnut hair very neatly done--and as a side-long glance; presently as a quickly turned face that looked for me.|$|E
6000|$|By {{this time}} poor J----- (who, with his taste for art yet undeveloped, is the {{companion}} {{of all our}} visits to sculpture and picture galleries) was wofully hungry, and for bread we {{had given him a}} stone,--not one stone, but a thousand. We returned to the hotel, and it being too damp and raw <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> Restaurant des Echelles, we dined at the hotel. In my opinion it would require less time to cultivate our gastronomic taste than taste of any other kind; and, on the whole, I am not sure that a man would not be wise to afford himself a little discipline in this line. It is certainly throwing away the bounties of Providence, to treat them as the English do, producing from better materials than the French have to work upon nothing but sirloins, joints, joints, steaks, steaks, steaks, chops, chops, chops, chops! We had a soup to-day, in which twenty kinds of vegetables were represented, and manifested each its own aroma; a fillet of stewed beef, and a fowl, in some sort of delicate fricassee. We had a bottle of Chablis, and renewed ourselves, {{at the close of the}} banquet, with a plate of Chateaubriand ice. It was all very good, and we respected ourselves far more than if we had eaten a quantity of red roast beef; but I am not quite sure that we were right. [...] .|$|E
60|$|But if {{we carry}} that spirit into religion, and our spiritual and heavenly duties; if {{we forget that}} that is the spirit of the world; if we forget that we renounced the world at our baptism, and that we {{therefore}} promised not to shape our lives by ITS rules and maxims; if our thought is, not of whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, of good report, whatsoever brings us true honour and deserved praise from God and from man; if we think only that intensely selfish and worldly thought, How much will God take for saving my soul?--which is the secret thought (alas that it should be so!) of too many of all denominations,--then we shall be in a fair way of killing our souls; so that if they be saved, they will not at all events be saved alive. For we shall kill in our souls just those instincts of purity, justice, generosity, mercy, love, in one word, of unselfishness and unworldliness, which make the very life of the soul, because they are inspired by the Spirit of God, even the Holy Ghost. And we shall be but too likely not to sit in heavenly places with Christ Jesus--as St. Paul tells us we may do even in this life: but <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> own place--wherever that may be--with selfish Judas, who when he found that his Saviour was not about to restore the kingdom to Israel, and make a great prince of him there and then, made the best investment he could, under the danger which he saw at hand, by selling his Lord for thirty pieces of silver: to remain to all time a warning to those who are religious for self-interest's sake.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true," [...] Westover assented. [...] "We're terribly inflexible. Nothing but {{something}} like a change of heart, {{as they used to}} call it, can make us different, and even then we're apt <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> <b>our</b> old shape. When you look at it in that light, marriage seems impossible. Yet it takes place every day!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} term of the George W. Bush administration, the head of WINPAC was Alan Foley.

60|$|With {{hardly an}} exception, nearly all my young friends are there still, {{and all are}} like myself, single. Indeed, it cannot well be otherwise, for there is {{literally}} no one for them to marry. The boys, as they have grown up, have left the town, and are seen no more; and of them all--of all those rude, unruly boys who used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> parties, and blow out the lights and kiss us, hardly one remains. Many are dead. Rivers was killed at the Cape; Jameson died of fever in India; Smithers, Lacy, and Marsden, all sleep far away from their English homes, under the rich soil of the Crimea; Thompson was drowned at sea. Many {{of them are in}} the army and navy, and scattered all over the world. Two or three have emigrated to Australia. Hampton is a rising young barrister on the Northern circuit. Travers is a struggling curate in London; and Douglas, more fortunate, has a living in Devonshire. Two of the Hoopers are clerks in the Bank of Ireland, and one of them a medical man of good position near Reigate. Many of them have married; but they have chosen their wives in the neighbourhoods where their profession had thrown them. Anyhow, none of them had taken Canterbury girls; and these--pretty, amiable, and ladylike, as many of them are--seemed doomed to remain unmarried. One or two of them only, frightened at the hopeless look-out, have recklessly taken up with marching subalterns from the garrison; but the rest look but gravely upon such doings, for the Canterbury girls are far too properly brought up to regard a red coat with anything but a pious horror, as a creature of the most dangerous description, very wild, and generally very poor; but withal exceedingly fascinating, to be approached with great caution, and to be flirted with demurely at the race-ball, and during the cricket-week, but at other times to be avoided and shunned; and it is an agreed thing among them, supported by the general experience of the few who have tried the experiment, that even a life of celibacy at Canterbury is preferable to the lot of a sub.'s wife in a marching regiment.|$|E
60|$|The {{moral of}} Mr. Seeley's book is in {{substance}} this, {{that if we}} allow 'ourselves to be moved sensibly nearer in our thoughts and feelings to the colonies, and accustom ourselves to think of emigrants as {{not in any way}} lost to England by settling in the colonies, the result might be, first, that emigration on a vast scale might become our remedy for pauperism; and, secondly, that some organisation might gradually be arrived at which might make the whole force of the empire available in time of war' (p. 298). Regarded as a contribution, then, to that practical statesmanship which is the other side of historical study, Mr. Seeley's book contains two suggestions: emigration on a vast scale and a changed organisation. On the first not many words will be necessary. They come to this, that unless the emigration on a vast scale is voluntary, all experience shows that it will fail inevitably, absolutely, and disastrously: and next, that if it is voluntary, it will never on a vast scale, though it may in rare individual instances, set in a given direction by mere movement of our thoughts and feelings about the flag or the empire. It is not sentiment but material advantages that settle the currents of emigration. Within a certain number of years 4,500,000 of British emigrants have gone to the United States, and only 2,500,000 to the whole of the British possessions. Last year 179,000 went to the United States, and only 43,000 to Canada. The chairman of the Hudson's Bay Company the other day plainly admitted to his shareholders that 'as long as the United States possessed a prairie country and Canada did not, the former undoubtedly offered greater advantages for the poorer class of emigrants.' He would not force emigrants to go to any particular country, 'but everything else being equal, he would exercise what moral influence he could to induce emigrants <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> own possessions' (Report in Times, November 23, 1883). The first step, therefore, is to secure that everything else shall be equal. When soil, climate, facility of acquisition, proximity to English ports, are all equalised, it will be quite time enough to hope for a change in the currents of emigration, and when that time comes the change will be wrought not by emotions of patriotic sentiment, but by calculations of prudence. No true patriot can honestly wish that it should be otherwise, for patriotism is regard for the wellbeing of the people of a country as well as affection for its flag.|$|E
