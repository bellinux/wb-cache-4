She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming that she had been raped by an unknown soldier.|$|E
5|$|Several {{researchers}} {{also consider the}} connection between the Skene's gland and the G-spot to be weak. The urethral sponge, however, which is also hypothesized as the G-spot, contains sensitive nerve endings and erectile tissue. Sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons. While G-spot opponents argue <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> are very few tactile nerve endings in the vagina and that therefore the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure-sensitive nerves.|$|E

5|$|Tyler Walker, the ADR {{director}} of the English dub of the series, held auditions for six days, during which about 140 people came for the eighteen main roles. Walker states that {{this is probably the}} longest casting process Funimation has held. He comments <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> are a lot of characters {{and most of them are}} older men, a character type he does not work with often, choosing voice actors and familiarizing them with their characters was difficult. He asked many directors and actors for recommendations and mainly aimed to cast newcomers, as he felt Baccano! provided him a chance to discover newer talent. Walker wished to find actors who could provide the dialect and accents of the various time periods and locations, especially when casting for the characters with heavy European accents.|$|E
5|$|During 1942–1943, Julia {{lived with}} her son at The Dairy Cottage, 120aAllerton Road, Woolton. The cottage was owned by Mimi's husband, and Mimi wanted Julia to live there because they would be closer to her house and also out of the Stanley house. As Alf was often away at sea, Julia started going out to dance halls. In 1942, she met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was {{stationed}} in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf later blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling her <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> was a war on, she should go out and enjoy herself. After an evening out, she would often give her young son a piece of chocolate or shortcrust pastry the next morning for breakfast. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming {{that she had been}} raped by an unknown soldier. Williams refused to live with Julia— who was still married to Alf— until she gave up John, which she refused to do. When Alf eventually came home in 1944, he offered to look after his wife, their son, and the expected baby, but she rejected the idea.|$|E

25|$|After the October Revolution the Kievan {{faction of}} the Bolshevik Party instigated the {{uprising}} in Kiev on November 8, 1917 {{in order to establish}} Soviet power in the city. Kiev Military District forces attempted to stop it, but after the Tsentralna Rada threw its support behind the Bolsheviks, the Russian forces were eliminated from Kiev. After expelling the government forces, the Rada announced a wider autonomy for the Ukrainian Republic, still maintaining ties to Russia, on November 22, 1917. The territory of the republic was proclaimed by the Third Universal November 20, 1917 (November 7 by Old Style) of the Tsentralna Rada encompassing the governorates: Volyn, Kiev, Podolie, Chernigov, Poltava, Kharkov, Yekaterinoslav, Kerson, Taurida (not including Crimea). It also stated that the people of the governorates: Voronezh, Kholm, and Kursk were welcome to join the republic through a referendum. Further the Tsentralna Rada in its Universal stated <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> was no Government in the Russian Republic after the October Revolution it proclaimed itself the Supreme governing body of the territory of Ukraine until order in the Russian republic could be restored. The Central Rada called all revolutionary activities such as the October Revolution a civil war and expressed its hopes for the resolution of the chaos.|$|E

500|$|The April in Paris Ball was {{an annual}} gala event whose {{mission was to}} improve Franco–American relations, to share cultures, and to help provide {{assistance}} to US and French charities, aside from commemorating the 2000th anniversary {{of the founding of}} Paris. It was established by Claude Philippe, the hotel banquet manager, in 1952. While the hotel's management handled invitations and publicity, other details were coordinated by socialites. Elsa Maxwell was given the primary responsibility in organizing it. It was initially held annually in April, but according to Ann Vaccaro, {{former executive director of the}} ball, it was changed to October because [...] "Mr. Philippe decided <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> are so many balls in the spring he would make it in October". After being changed to October, it often marked the start of the US fall social season. It was staged in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf for eight years before moving to the Hotel Astor in 1960, the Seventh Regiment Armory in 1961, and other venues.|$|E
500|$|Part of {{the problem}} with {{creating}} [...] "mytharc" [...] for the writers was due to the fact <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> were so few mythology episodes each season, they were often forced to put as much material as they could into each episode. Originally, {{a large portion of the}} episode was supposed to reveal the history of the Syndicate via flashback. Reportedly, these scenes would have featured younger versions of Bill Mulder (played by Peter Donat), The Smoking Man, Dr. Openshaw, the Elders, and many others. However, this never panned out, and Carter and Spotnitz had to reframe the episode around narration courtesy of the Smoking Man, which was filmed and edited under extreme pressure near the end of production. While the previous episode, [...] "Two Fathers", was titled after the duality of Bill Mulder and The Smoking Man, this episode was titled [...] "One Son" [...] to reflect the fact that Mulder was the only remaining son of either of these fathers, after the shooting of Jeffrey Spender and the rejection of Alex Krycek.|$|E

500|$|Gilligan {{reasoned}} that, because Mulder and Scully {{would appear}} on a nationally syndicated television series, the episode's main monster could not be shown, only [...] "hinted at". Gilligan and the writing staff applied methods previously used in the 1999 psychological horror film The Blair Witch Project to show as little of the monster as possible while still making the episode scary. Michael Watkins, who directed the episode, had a good rapport with the Los Angeles police department. As such, he secured real Sheriff's deputies as extras. Casting director Rick Milikan later explained that the group needed [...] "actors who could pull off the believability in just normal off-the-cuff conversation of cops on the job." [...] During the crack house scene, real SWAT team members were hired {{to break down the}} doors. Actor Judson Mills later explained <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> were few cameramen and owing to {{the manner in which the}} episode was filmed, [...] "people just behaved as if we were [...] cops. I had other cops waving and giving their signals or heads-up the way they do amongst themselves. It was quite funny".|$|E
500|$|Although {{all of the}} orphanage's {{residents}} were given a dose of Epsom salts once {{a week in the}} morning, some former residents have given accounts of brutal punishments and mistreatment. One states <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> were 200 boys and only 12 toilets, some would defecate in the urinals, drains, on the grass, or in their pants. As a result, the boys would receive beltings for doing this. Another account by a boy who stayed at the orphanage states that when he arrived there, he was separated from his brother and was given a set of clothes to wear despite having his own. Anyone who did not comply would receive a belting. The boys were issued no underwear and clothes were [...] washed only once a week. Beatings were common, and not just for punishment; sometimes it may have been more for mental scarring. Other accounts claim there were beatings, and repetitive rape, not only by the staff but also by older boys and the orphanage caretaker. Despite this, some former residents say the nuns were [...] "tough but fair" [...] and they [...] were fed three meals a day. Some even stayed in contact with their caregivers once they left.|$|E
500|$|In 1951 Philippe {{founded the}} April in Paris Ball at the Waldorf.

After being changed to October, it often marked the start of the US fall social season; the balls were major events in the socialite calendar, and raised millions of dollars for American and French charities over the 28 years of its existence. It was staged in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf for eight years before moving to the Hotel Astor in 1960, the Seventh Regiment Armory in 1961, and other venues. The ball was designed to cater for [...] "very, very high-class people" [...] according to Vaccaro. Raffle tickets cost US$100 per person and offered opulent prizes such as a US$5000 bracelet and other jewels, expensive furs, perfumes and even cars. It attracted many of the most famous people of the day, including Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich. By the mid 1970s his balls were charging $185 per person; the 1974 ball netted roughly $175,000. During his career at the Waldorf Astoria it has been estimated that Philippe was responsible for his clients spending $150 million alone on banquets.|$|E

500|$|The episode [...] "What Was Missing" [...] became {{controversial}} {{because of}} an allegedly implied past relationship between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum. The controversy largely began after an accompanying [...] "Mathematical" [...] recap—a studio-endorsed behind the scenes video series implied that there were lesbian relations between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline and that the writing staff actively seeks input from fans. This incident was addressed by the show's producer, Fred Seibert, who said that [...] "in {{trying to get the}} show’s audience involved we got wrapped up by both fan conjecture and spicy fanart and went a little too far." [...] Soon after, the video recap and the entire channel was pulled off of YouTube, although [...] "What Was Missing" [...] still airs during reruns. Seibert's decision to remove the video also proved controversial; Bitch magazine later wrote an article about how the episode [...] "handled female desire—female queer desire at that—in a subtle but complex way", but that the removal of the recap and the studio's perceived treatment of the controversy was detrimental towards the acceptance of queer romance in children's television. Ward later addressed the issue and gave a more neutral view; he said <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> were [...] "so many extreme positions taken on it all over the Internet", he did not [...] "really want to comment on it [...] it was a big hullaballoo." [...] In August 2014, Olson commented on the controversy, telling a crowd of fans gathered at a Barnes & Noble book signing from The Adventure Time Encyclopedia, that, according to Ward, Marceline and Princess Bubblegum had dated in the past, but that because the series airs in some areas where homosexual relationships are illegal, the show {{has not been able to}} officially make clear the relationship in the series itself.|$|E

The Seattle Times Melanie McFarland was unsure whether the series' success in Canada would follow when it began airing in the US.

She was, however, [...] "happy [...] chose Degrassi students to navigate teen perils instead of digging up Screech and the gang for another nauseating go-round". Tony Atherton of the Ottawa Citizen had mixed feelings of the new incarnation, saying it [...] "has a cleaner, more polished look, has lost its edge [...] nothing new to viewers familiar with the groundbreaking preceding series, nor to anyone else who has watched the deluge of teen dramas since", adding <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is [...] "little ground left to break in teen drama there is a sense of déjà vu with regards to the plots and characters".
