5|$|For the {{remainder}} of her career, Connecticut sailed to various places in both the Atlantic and Pacific while training newer recruits to the Navy. However, {{the provisions of the}} 1922 Washington Naval Treaty stipulated that many of the older battleships, Connecticut among <b>them,</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to be disposed of, so she was decommissioned on 1 March 1923 and sold for scrap on 1 November 1923.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, {{three major}} {{commuter}} groups in New Jersey made expansion proposals.

5|$|The good {{understanding}} between the patroons of the Amsterdam Chamber left {{nothing to be}} desired; Burgh, Godyn, Blommaert, and Van Rensselaer, before signifying to the directors their willingness to start colonies, made an agreement to work the projected colonies on joint account, each {{under the direction of}} one of them. Three of <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a one-fifth share in each colony, while the fourth would receive the remaining two fifths, taking the responsibility for its management and exercising patroon rights.|$|E

5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom {{operator}} {{checked the}} White House Farm line—at 3:56am {{according to the}} police log and at 4:30 am according to the Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open. The operator could hear a dog barking. According to British Telecom, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would therefore {{not have been able to}} use his telephone to report the call to the police immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement he said he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. That the line would not have cleared is one of several disputed points.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Ti'ana {{takes place}} earlier than The Book of Atrus. The {{first part of}} the book focuses on life of Atrus' {{grandfather}} Aitrus with his parents Kahlis and Tasera, Aitrus' meeting with Ti'ana, and the birth of their son Gehn. The book also explains the destruction of the D'ni civilization. Two D'ni, Veovis and A'Gaeris, plot to destroy their civilization, which they believe has been corrupted. Veovis and A'Gaeris create a plague which wipes out many of the D'ni and follows them through the Ages. Veovis is murdered by A'Gaeris for refusing to write an Age where the two of <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been worshipped as gods, and Aitrus sacrifices himself in order to lure A'Gaeris to an unstable Age, killing them both.|$|E
5|$|The English army {{consisted}} {{entirely of}} infantry. It {{is possible that}} some of the higher class members of the army rode to battle, but when battle was joined they dismounted to fight on foot. The core of the army was made up of housecarls, full-time professional soldiers. Their armour consisted of a conical helmet, a mail hauberk, and a shield, which might be either kite-shaped or round. Most housecarls fought with the two-handed Danish battleaxe, but they could also carry a sword. The rest of the army was made up of levies from the fyrd, also infantry but more lightly armoured and not professionals. Most of the infantry would have formed part of the shield wall, in which all the men in the front ranks locked their shields together. Behind <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been axemen and men with javelins as well as archers.|$|E

5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} use other Batman characters in the game, but these were removed when it was decided they would not work within the story. For example, Batman's enemy Mr. Freeze did not fit because the character has different motivations to the Joker. Unlike the Riddler, who is obsessed with proving his superiority over Batman, Mr. Freeze does not hold a personal grudge against Batman, and Mr. Freeze would not care about the other villains' plans. A garden maze under Poison Ivy's control was considered as a location; she could grow it in different directions. In its center, Batman would find the Mad Hatter hosting a tea-party, but the developers decided these ideas would not match the game's tone. Batman's vehicles, the Batmobile and Batwing, were considered {{for inclusion in the}} game, but developing unique control mechanics and gameplay segments for <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> taken too much time, and compromised its quality; the vehicles appear in the game, but players cannot control them.|$|E
5|$|Such densities are {{possible}} because white dwarf material is not composed of atoms joined by chemical bonds, but rather {{consists of a}} plasma of unbound nuclei and electrons. There is therefore no obstacle to placing nuclei closer than normally allowed by electron orbitals limited by normal matter. Eddington wondered what would happen when this plasma cooled and the energy to keep the atoms ionized was no longer sufficient. This paradox was resolved by R. H. Fowler in 1926 by an application of the newly devised quantum mechanics. Since electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can occupy the same state, and they must obey Fermi–Dirac statistics, also introduced in 1926 to determine the statistical distribution of particles which satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle. At zero temperature, therefore, electrons can not all occupy the lowest-energy, or ground, state; some of <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to occupy higher-energy states, forming a band of lowest-available energy states, the Fermi sea. This state of the electrons, called degenerate, meant that a white dwarf could cool to zero temperature and still possess high energy.|$|E
25|$|The tenant farms also boasted {{distinct}} architecture, mostly vernacular styles. Most notable among <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{been the}} wooden, center-aisled New World Dutch barn, often built before the farmhouse. In the pre-industrial era, it could store {{all the animals}} and equipment necessary for growing and harvesting wheat, the region's primary cash crop, {{as well as the}} harvest itself. Several remain standing.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in the County Championship, Lancashire {{assumed the}} {{ascendancy}} of Division Two with an eight-wicket win over Essex which also secured their return to Division One after only one season on the lowest rung of the Championship ladder. National League losses for Worcestershire Royals and Hampshire Hawks then left four teams on 22 points {{in the bottom of}} Division One – three of <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to go down.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} {{physicians}} who reported having made a mistake, it was offered that disclosing to non-physician sources of support may reduce stress more than disclosing to physician colleagues. This {{may be due to}} the finding that of the physicians in the same study, when presented with a hypothetical scenario of a mistake made by another colleague, only 32% of <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> unconditionally offered support. It is possible that greater benefit occurs when spouses are physicians.|$|E

25|$|When {{the first}} forests arose on Earth, new niches for {{terrestrial}} animals were created. Spore-feeders {{and others who}} depended on plants and/or the animals living around <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to adapt too {{to make use of}} them. In a world with no flying animals, it would probably just be {{a matter of time before}} some arthropods who were living in the trees evolved paired structures with muscle attachments from their exoskeleton and used them for gliding, one pair on each segment. Further evolution in this direction would give bigger gliding structures on their thorax and gradually smaller ones on their abdomen. Their bodies would have become stiffer while thysanurans, which didn't evolve flight, kept their flexible abdomen.|$|E
25|$|British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin heard Marshall's radio {{broadcast}} speech and immediately contacted French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault to begin preparing a quick European response to (and acceptance of) the offer, {{which led to}} the creation of the Committee of European Economic Co-operation. The two agreed that it would be necessary to invite the Soviets as the other major allied power. Marshall's speech had explicitly included an invitation to the Soviets, feeling that excluding <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a sign of distrust. State Department officials, however, knew that Stalin would almost certainly not participate, and that any plan that would send large amounts of aid to the Soviets was unlikely to be approved by Congress.|$|E

They claimed Article 11 must be intrepreted as allowing governments a broad margin of appreciation, as this was required to accommodate the cultural situation of homosexuality in Russia. The Government also claimed that it had been necessary to ban the event for the protection of morals, referring prominent religious organisations' opposition to the march, and that, as there was no consensus between member states as to the legitimacy of homosexuality within society, national authorities were better placed than the European Court to determine the conditions for such events.|$|E

25|$|Tony Blair had in 1993, before {{becoming}} Leader of the Labour Party, written a pamphlet for the Fabian Society which criticised {{the wording of}} Clause IV for not clearly stating the means and ends of the party. Blair put forward a case for defining socialism {{in terms of a}} set of values which were constant, while the policies needed to achieve <b>them</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> to account for changing society. After becoming Leader, he announced at the conclusion of his 1994 conference speech that the Labour Party needed a new statement of aims and values and that he would draw one up and present it to the party. This astonished many people, as the last time such a move had been taken (by Hugh Gaitskell in the late 1950s), it had been a failure.|$|E
25|$|Under the program, the {{abatement}} {{lasts for}} three years of construction and 35 additional years. A full abatement on the tax increase will take place for the first 25 years after the construction period, with the tax benefits {{in the last ten}} years being tied to the number of affordable units created. For condominium projects, the new 421-a program is also an option. However, condominium projects only qualify for this program if the project has 35 units or less, is not located in Manhattan, and has a per unit assessed value at $65,000 or less. The abatement program excludes luxury condominiums projects after a proposal to include them was defeated in the state legislature.
