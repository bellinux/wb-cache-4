5|$|Philip {{realized}} that the sole intention of the Athenian support for Argeus was to recover Amphipolis (see below), which <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> to do by placing Argeus on the throne. Philip therefore withdrew the Macedonian garrison from Amphipolis and declared it autonomous, to undermine the purpose of Athenian support for Argeus.|$|E
5|$|A {{social control}} program was {{implemented}} whereby local unions took on responsibility for ensuring that this quota was not exceeded; in doing so, <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> {{to remove the}} need for military and police intervention, and thus stem the violence of previous decades. Measures were implemented to ensure the industrialization of coca production, with Morales inaugurating the first coca industrialization plant in Chulumani, which produced and packaged coca and trimate tea; the project was primarily funded through a $125,000 donation from Venezuela under the PTA scheme.|$|E

5|$|However, even {{following}} Romanum decet pontificem, {{only three}} of the eight Popes of the 18th century failed to make a nephew or brother cardinal. The College of Cardinals apparently preferred rule by nephews than by favorites, which they perceived as the alternative; for example, the College urged Pope Benedict XIII (1724–1730) to appoint a cardinal-nephew, who <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> would replace Benedict XIII's notorious lieutenant Niccolò Coscia. Pope Gregory XIII (1572–1585) also had to be urged by key figures in the College to appoint his cardinal-nephew: Filippo Boncompagni.|$|E

The gardens were well-received by locals and led to a city-wide project called Meadow Bristol, to grow similar meadows elsewhere.|$|E

During its first day of operation, the game registered 200,000 users, making it the best-selling mobile game up until that time, and was accessed 1.6 million times. According to Ito, by 2006, the game was still highly popular in Japan.|$|E

He went hitless in five games, with seven strikeouts, and when the minor league season ended on September 2 he was moved to Camelback Ranch to continue his rehab rather than being activated.|$|E
