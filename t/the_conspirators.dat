5|$|<b>The</b> <b>conspirators</b> {{first told}} Justin, Germanus's eldest son, of their intentions. He, in turn, {{informed}} his father, who then held counsel with the comes excubitorum, Marcellus. In {{order to find}} out more of their intentions, Germanus met <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> in person, while a trusted aide of Marcellus, named Leontius, was concealed nearby and listened in. Marcellus then informed Emperor Justinian, and <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> were arrested, but treated with remarkable leniency. At first, Germanus and his sons too were suspected, until the testimony of Marcellus and the commanders Constantianus and Bouzes cleared them.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>conspirators</b> practiced {{different}} ways of murdering Turner. According to informant statements to law enforcement, one of <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> was to pretend there was car trouble, and the others would then approach Turner with their guns. Informants later told law enforcement officials that <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> intended to hide out at an international network of Rajneesh communes if the plan was successful. According to The Oregonian the assassinations were not carried out because Ma Anand Sheela became distracted by political power plays within the Rajneesh commune {{and other members of}} the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group. And according to witness information, Ma Anand Sheela was persuaded not to carry out this action through conversations with Carol Matthews, who stated to her that this was not a solution in any way and would be a horrendous action.|$|E
5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} on March 15, 44 BC. The {{assassination}} {{was led by}} Gaius Cassius and Marcus Brutus. Most of <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> were senators, who had a variety of economic, political, or personal motivations for carrying out the assassination. Many were afraid that Caesar would soon resurrect the monarchy and declare himself king. Others feared loss of property or prestige as Caesar carried out his land reforms {{in favor of the}} landless classes. Virtually all <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> fled the city after Caesar's death in fear of retaliation. The civil war that followed destroyed {{what was left of the}} Republic.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>conspirators</b> included: Ma Anand Sheela, Sally-Anne Croft, Chief Financial Officer of Rajneeshpuram; Susan Hagan, head of {{security}} at Rajneeshpuram, Catherine Jane Stork, who bought weapons and silencers and volunteered {{to be the}} actual murderer; Ann Phyllis McCarthy, fourth-in-command of Rajneeshpuram; and co-conspirators Alma Potter, Carol Matthews, Phyllis Caldwell and Richard Kevin Langford. Two of <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> obtained false identification to purchase handguns out-of-state, stalked Turner, and planned to murder him near his workplace in Portland, Oregon. The assassination plot was never carried out and was only discovered later, {{as a result of}} the investigation by federal law enforcement into the bioterror attack in The Dalles and other illegal acts by the Rajneeshpuram leadership.|$|E
5|$|According to Cassius Dio, <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> {{approached}} Nerva as {{a potential}} successor prior to the assassination, which indicates {{that he was at}} least aware of the plot. Suetonius by contrast does not mention Nerva, but he may have omitted his role out of tactfulness. Considering the works of Suetonius were published under Nerva's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian, it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder. On the other hand, Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to <b>the</b> <b>conspirators.</b> The precise facts have been obscured by history, but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news of the assassination broke.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{contemporary}} historian Yahya of Antioch, <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> of 1022 were released by Constantine VIII after Basil's death in 1025, but Xiphias remained in exile until 1028, when the new emperor, Romanos III, released him. Xiphias, however, was by now too old and weary, and soon retired to the Stoudios Monastery. Nothing further is known of him.|$|E

5|$|Caesar {{was assassinated}} in March 44 BC. The motives of <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> were both personal, as well as political. Many of Caesar's {{ultimate}} assassins were envious of him, and dissatisfied with the recognition that they had received from him. Most of <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> were senators, {{and many of them}} were angry {{about the fact that he}} had deprived the senate of much of its power and prestige. They were also angry that, while they had received few honors, Caesar had been given many honors. There were also rumors that he was going to make himself king, and transfer the seat of government to Alexandria. The grievances that they held against him were vague, and as such, their plan against him was vague. The fact that their motives were vague, and that they had no idea of what to do after his assassination, both were plainly obvious by the subsequent course of events.|$|E
5|$|Despite these events, Pisander and {{the other}} envoys of <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> arrived at Athens and made a speech before the people. Pisander won the argument, putting Alcibiades and his {{promises}} at the center. The Ecclesia deposed Phrynichus and elected Pisander and ten other envoys to negotiate with Tissaphernes and Alcibiades.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the failure of the negotiations, <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> succeeded in overthrowing the {{democracy}} and imposing the oligarchic government of the Four Hundred, among the leaders of which were Phrynichus and Pisander. At Samos, however, a similar coup instigated by <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> did not go forward so smoothly. Samian democrats learned of the conspiracy and notified four prominent Athenians: the generals Leon and Diomedon, the trierarch Thrasybulus, and Thrasyllus, at that time a hoplite in the ranks. With the support of these men and the Athenian soldiers in general, the Samian democrats were able to defeat the 300 Samian oligarchs who attempted to seize power there. Further, the Athenian troops at Samos formed themselves into a political assembly, deposed their generals, and elected new ones, including Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus. The army, stating that they had not revolted from the city but that the city had revolted from them, resolved to stand by the democracy while continuing to prosecute the war against Sparta.|$|E

5|$|John's coup was {{launched}} on 31 July 1201, when <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> {{broke into the}} Hagia Sophia, where they swore to restore the Empire to its ancient bounds against the Vlach-Bulgarians, Seljuk Turks and the Latin Crusaders. While John was being proclaimed emperor and crowned by a monk— since Patriarch John X Kamateros hid himself inside a cupboard— the capital's populace rioted outside and set fire {{to a number of}} churches. <b>The</b> <b>conspirators</b> then marched towards the Great Palace. Avoiding the Chalke Gate, which was held by the feared Varangian Guard, they made for the imperial box in the Hippodrome, the kathisma, which was connected to the palace precinct. John's supporters indeed managed to drive off the Macedonian guard placed there and entered the palace through the Kareia Gate.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{there were}} some who were {{concerned}} by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this {{came to a head}} with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio. Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio. Murena was named among <b>the</b> <b>conspirators,</b> the outspoken Consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus Affair. <b>The</b> <b>conspirators</b> were tried in absentia with Tiberius acting as prosecutor; the jury found them guilty, {{but it was not a}} unanimous verdict. All the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed as soon as they were captured—without ever giving testimony in their defence. Augustus ensured that the facade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events.|$|E

5|$|The novel's {{narrative}} {{is divided into}} three distinct strands.

The novel alternates between these storylines, and also jumps back and forth from 1961 to 1996, with frequent flashbacks to periods earlier in Trujillo's regime.|$|E
5|$|A plot by {{some members}} of the {{imperial}} government to restore him was discovered in December 947 and <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> mutilated and publicly humiliated. Stephen died at Methymna on Easter Sunday, 963. John Skylitzes claims that Stephen was poisoned by order of the Empress Theophano as part of her efforts to protect the rights to the throne of her sons Basil II and Constantine VIII, by eliminating other possible claimants to the throne. It should, however, be noted that several deaths of the extended imperial family at the time are attributed to Theophano by hostile sources, usually by poison.|$|E

5|$|As the President of the United States {{refuses to}} loan dataDyne the Pelagic II, <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> plot {{to kill him}} and replace him with a dataDyne-grown clone. To {{accomplish}} their plans, an NSA strike team led by Trent Easton invades the air base from which Air Force One will depart. When Joanna foils this strike, the NSA along with some Scandinavians take over the plane itself, which crashes after an attempt to detach a craft attached to it. Having survived the crash, Joanna eliminates the President's clone and rescues the real President. Meanwhile, Easton is killed by one particular Scandinavian known as Mr. Blonde, who is revealed to be a Skedar in disguise. Without permission from the President, dataDyne decides to hijack the Pelagic II and reach the ancient spacecraft. However, unbeknownst to dataDyne, the Carrington Institute learns that the spacecraft contains a powerful weapon capable of destroying a planet and that <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> are actually Skedar aliens disguised as Scandinavian humans who intend to test the weapon on Earth before using it against the Maian homeworld.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, many of {{the grand}} mansions on the Strand were {{demolished}} as the aristocracy moved to the West End.

In {{the time of the}} Civil War, the Nag's Head tavern was the venue of a meeting between Henry Ireton and some of the Levellers which resulted in the production of Remonstrance of the Army, demanding the abolition of the monarchy and the trial of King Charles I.|$|E

After relocating to Panay island and consolidating a coalition of native Visayan allies, Hispanic soldiers and Latin-American recruits, the Spaniards then invaded Islamic Manila, therein they put down the Tondo Conspiracy and exiled <b>the</b> <b>conspirators</b> to Guam and Guerrero. Under Spanish rule, they established Manila as {{the capital of the}} Spanish East Indies (1571).|$|E
