5|$|Soaring {{related to}} wind shear, also called dynamic soaring, is a {{technique}} used by soaring birds like albatrosses, who can maintain flight without wing flapping. If <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> shear is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can climb into <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> gradient, trading ground speed for height, while maintaining airspeed. By then turning downwind, and diving through <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> gradient, they can also gain energy. It has also been used by glider pilots on rare occasions.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field {{of a star}} interacts with the stellar wind. As <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> {{moves away from the}} star its rate of angular velocity slows.

As a result, angular momentum is transferred from the star to <b>the</b> <b>wind,</b> and over time this gradually slows the star's rate of rotation.|$|E

5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> direction and gradually move across the surface as <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper, {{which deals}} with <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> {{modeling}} of ac multi-phase machines with a regular distribution of the stator slots, details an original matrix modeling of <b>the</b> stator <b>winding.</b> First, <b>the</b> properties of the balanced multi-phase windings (with integral-slot and fractional-slot patterns) are analysed. <b>The</b> <b>winding</b> function approach, {{one of the most}} common way to model <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> distribution effects on the stator rotating field, is then introduced. For multi-phase machines, it will be shown that the pole number generated by <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> distribution depends on a new parameter: the circularity index. The discrete nature of <b>the</b> <b>winding,</b> imposed by <b>the</b> stator slots, leads to the development of a discrete modeling of <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> obtained from sampling <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> function: two matrices, <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> function matrix and the distribution function matrix, are introduced to characterize <b>the</b> multi-phase <b>winding.</b> This matrix approach is thus a concise way to calculate <b>the</b> <b>winding</b> factors and to estimate the set of self and mutual stator inductances for smooth air gap multi-phase machines. A particularly original method of obtaining an analytical expression for the leakage mutual inductance is described. The results are validated with two experimental 5 -phase PM machines by using experimental measurements and numerical simulations...|$|R

This barrier jet can increase the low level wind by 45%. Wind direction also changes because of the contour of the land.|$|E
