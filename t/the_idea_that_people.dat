5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E
25|$|In August 1938, Rockwell {{enrolled}} at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island as a philosophy major. In his sociology courses, he rejected equality, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{were made by}} their environment, {{and the idea that}} all human beings had the same potential in life. He debated with fellow students over topics such as social themes in popular novels.|$|E
25|$|The story also {{speaks of}} mob {{psychology}} and <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> can abandon reason and act cruelly {{if they are}} part of a large group of people behaving in the same manner. The idyllic setting of the story also demonstrates that violence and evil can take place anywhere and in any context. This also shows how people can turn on each other so easily.|$|E
50|$|The {{notion of}} {{consumer}} networks expresses <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people’s</b> embeddedness in social networks affects their behavior as consumers. Interactions within consumer networks such as information exchange and imitation can affect demand and market outcomes in ways not {{considered in the}} neoclassical theory of consumer choice.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked about}} his piece for {{exhibition}} [...] "Prospect '69," [...] his response was [...] "The piece consists of <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> will have from reading this interview... The piece in its entirety is unknowable because it exists {{in the mind of}} so many people. Each person can really know that part which is in his own mind." ...|$|R

25|$|In the study, {{researchers}} created {{two versions}} of the same news story – one with compelling negative images and one without. Participants were asked to watch a 20 minute news video (half of the participants saw the negative images and the other half did not) and an additional ten-minute video. They were instructed to pay attention because they would be tested afterwards. A follow up survey was sent 6 to 7 weeks later to measure memory and recall from the news video. The results support <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> better remember information that comes after a negative event. Respondents who viewed the negative images better remembered {{the second half of the}} newscast than the part preceding the negative images. The findings of this study further support the media equation assumption that mediated experiences are the same as natural experiences.|$|E
25|$|Our {{ideas about}} God are {{important}} indicators {{of how we}} view the world. According to Adler, these ideas have changed over time, as our {{vision of the world}} – and our place in it – has changed. Consider this example that Adler offers: the traditional belief that people were placed deliberately on earth as God's ultimate creation is being replaced with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> have evolved by natural selection. This coincides with a view of God not as a real being, but as an abstract representation of nature's forces. In this way our view of God has changed from one that was concrete and specific to one that is more general. From Adler's vantage point, this is a relatively ineffective perception of God because it is so general that it fails to convey a strong sense of direction and purpose.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{relationship}} between smoking and schizophrenia is well established, a factor {{to be considered in}} this relationship {{is the role of the}} tobacco industry. Research based on internal industry documents shows a concerted effort by the industry to promote belief that people with schizophrenia need to smoke and that it is dangerous for them to quit. Such promotion includes monitoring or supporting research that endorsed <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> with schizophrenia are uniquely immune to the health consequences of smoking (since proved false) and that tobacco is needed for people with schizophrenia to self-medicate. The industry also provided cigarettes to hospital wards and supported efforts to block hospital-based smoking bans. Although this does not discredit the effects of nicotine in schizophrenia, it is argued that the efforts of the tobacco industry slowed the decline in smoking prevalence in people with schizophrenia as well as the development of clinical policies to promote smoking cessation.|$|E
30|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects in this stream of research relates {{to the fact that there}} is scarce scientific support for <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people’s</b> level of happiness can change for the better (Lyubomirsky et al. 2005). These authors advance that very few interventions on happiness studies have been carried out to understand the “possibility of becoming happier”. In addition, the conception of happiness that underlies the existing studies is not always explicit.|$|R

30|$|It {{amazes me}} sometimes, when I sit in our {{collaboration}} meetings at <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> come up with. And {{how they can}} gear their subject towards how other subjects are doing something. Like the migration project. You know how the science teacher was able to tie in the migration of things with the humanities part, and the social studies. And even Spanish. <b>The</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> come to <b>the</b> table. And so I think as the year has progressed {{and we got to}} know each other better, the planning has gotten better also.|$|R
25|$|Some current genetic {{research}} supports <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{living in the}} British Isles are likely mainly descended from the indigenous European Paleolithic (Old Stone Age hunter gatherers) population (about 80%), with a smaller Neolithic (New Stone Age farmers) input (about 20%). Paleolithic Europeans {{seem to have been}} a homogeneous population, possibly due to a population bottleneck (or near-extinction event) on the Iberian peninsula, where a small human population is thought to have survived the glaciation, and expanded into Europe during the Mesolithic. The assumed genetic imprint of Neolithic incomers is seen as a cline, with stronger Neolithic representation in the east of Europe and stronger Paleolithic representation in the west of Europe. Most in Wales today regard themselves as modern Celts, claiming a heritage back to the Iron Age tribes, which themselves, based on modern genetic analysis, would appear to have had a predominantly Paleolithic and Neolithic indigenous ancestry. When the Roman legions departed Britain around 400, a Romano-British culture remained in the areas the Romans had settled, and the pre-Roman cultures in others.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{are drawn}} to professions that fit their name was {{suggested}} by psychologist Carl Jung, citing as an example Sigmund Freud who studied pleasure and whose surname means [...] "joy". A few recent empirical {{studies have indicated that}} certain professions are disproportionately represented by people with appropriate surnames (and sometimes given names), though the methods of these studies have been challenged. One explanation for nominative determinism is implicit egotism, which states that humans have an unconscious preference for things they associate with themselves. An alternative explanation is genetic: a person might be named Smith or Taylor because that was originally their occupation, and they would pass on their genes to their descendants, including an aptitude for activities involving strength in the case of Smith, or dexterity in the case of Taylor.|$|E
500|$|Gossard said [...] "No Way" [...] expresses <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{just need}} to live [...] "and quit trying to prove something."

[...] Ament said that [...] "Pilate" [...] concerned a question he was asking himself, dealing with a recurring dream Ament had with being old sitting with his dog on the porch, while [...] "Low Light" [...] was the answer, and that it deals with [...] "a kind of gratefulness at finding that place of calm and peace at my center and getting a glimpse of the person I could choose to be." ...|$|E
5000|$|The APPD {{propagated}} <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a [...] "youth pension", {{to replace}} the existing old-age pension. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> was <b>that</b> <b>people</b> should enjoy life first, and work later.|$|R

500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. I think of all the things that I still want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> assume that he is either gay or straight. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Hayes admitted that people believe he is Jack [...] "24 hours a day".|$|E
500|$|In December 2014, Jed Whedon {{explained}} {{the benefits of}} introducing a society of superhuman characters in the Inhumans, saying [...] "One of the things that, early on {{was very important to}} us last season was, there were so few people in the Cinematic Universe who had powers. Really, only two humans had powers, Captain America and the Hulk. We had to be very responsible—we didn't want to dive into this show and have a new one every week, and have it feel like we disregarded everything that they spent so much money and time building in the films. Along those same lines, the origin of a power is always a complex thing—Marvel cares about it feeling grounded, it feeling scientific at some level. Even on Thor, he says, [...] "In our world, magic and science are the same thing." [...] So this is a way for us to sort of open up our world. It's a way to introduce, into the MCU, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> can be born with a power. They don't have to be engineered in a lab, they don't need to have some freak accident with a vat of acid. They can be born with this. That's sort of a gamechanger, not just on our show, but in the cinematic universe".|$|E
500|$|Liptak said it portrays {{people as}} victims of technology, while Joyner commented it denotes that [...] "the {{way in which we}} are spoon-fed an almost {{constant}} stream of information through technology has turned us into passive consumers". Joyner believes that Brooker implicates the viewer with the story's credits scene, noting [...] "we're the ones with the smartphones, passively absorbing abuses to human rights and decency, and yet revelling in the image from the safety of the screen". Jeffery and Parker affirmed it contains <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> are preferring to document life rather than living it, as exemplified by [...] "people who see violence break out ... and decide to film it rather than intervene." [...] Leigh Alexander of Boing Boing said the episode reflects how violence is easily accessed on the Internet and quickly arouses people's attention. She noted, [...] "you can view the episode as a critique of all kinds of themes: Mob mentality, reality television, even the complicated treatment of women in the justice system ... Primarily, though, this episode is a critique of our deep, often-unexamined mass desensitization, or at least a dread portent of its potential to grow. It aims to ask: To what extent can you stand by and watch horror before you are complicit, punishable?" ...|$|E
50|$|Christian Universalists point {{towards the}} mistranslations of the Greek word αιών (Lit. aion), as {{giving rise to}} <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Eternal Hell, and <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> some <b>people</b> will not be saved.|$|R
40|$|Hypotheses which concern human 2 ̆ 2 {{migration}} 2 ̆ 2 {{within and}} without the Central Subarea of the Great Plains during the Late Prehistoric period are examined.

500|$|According to Neil Finn, [...] "It (Time on Earth) doesn't {{sound like}} any one {{particular}} Crowded House album, {{but it has}} elements of Crowded House... {{in as much as}} Nick and I make a sound together when we play and always did. I think there's a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward. And as such, it seemed the most obvious and {{best way to do that}} was to be playing music again with each other, Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be." [...] Crowded House's leader, Neil Finn has indicated that, as the album began life as a solo project, its sound is generally different from Crowded House, though similar in parts, indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one. As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death, much of the album has a mournful tone, however this has been received well by critics, with some indicating that [...] "fortunately, Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity, (both) lyrically and musically". Finn has said of the song [...] "People Are Like Suns", that [...] "Part of it is <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> burn brightly and then they fade out. Also, when I wrote it, I was reading Ian McEwan's novel Saturday, which begins with a man on his balcony watching his plane go down, so the first lines borrow something from that image." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{theme of}} absence was {{reflected}} in the ideas produced by his long hours spent brainstorming with the band. [...] Thorgerson had noted that Roxy Music's Country Life was sold in an opaque green cellophane sleeve – censoring the cover image – and he copied the idea, concealing the artwork for Wish You Were Here in a black-coloured shrink-wrap (therefore making the album art [...] "absent"). [...] The concept behind [...] "Welcome to the Machine" [...] and [...] "Have a Cigar" [...] suggested the use of a handshake (an often empty gesture), and George Hardie designed a sticker containing the album's logo of two mechanical hands engaged in a handshake, to be placed on the opaque sleeve (the mechanical handshake logo would also appear on the labels of the vinyl album this time in a black and blue background). [...] The album's cover images were photographed by Aubrey 'Po' Powell, Storm's partner at the Pink Floyd design studio Hipgnosis and was inspired by <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> tend to conceal their true feelings, for fear of [...] "getting burned", and thus two businessmen were pictured shaking hands, one man on fire. [...] "Getting burned" [...] was also a common phrase in the music industry, used often by artists denied royalty payments. [...] Two stuntmen were used (Ronnie Rondell and Danny Rogers), one dressed in a fire-retardant suit covered by a business suit. [...] His head was protected by a hood, underneath a wig. [...] The photograph was taken at the Warner Bros. studios in Los Angeles. [...] Initially the wind was blowing in the wrong direction, and the flames were forced into Rondell's face, burning his moustache. [...] The two stuntmen changed positions, and the image was later reversed.|$|E
2500|$|Another topic many entries {{were based}} on is human behavior. [...] J. Craig Venter {{discussed}} the genetic base of how humans act; Jerry Coyne also wrote on <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> are predisposed to act in certain ways because of genetics.|$|E

25|$|But {{when it came}} to {{expansion}} {{in other parts of the}} world, namely Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, then totally new cultural dynamics had entered into the equation, so to speak, and one sees here of what was to take the Americas, South East Asia, and the Pacific by storm a few hundred years later. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>peoples</b> who possessed cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power is no new idea borne out of the Medieval period or the Enlightenment.|$|R
50|$|Another {{main concern}} is that the data {{collected}} does not have an expiration date. People who buy something on the internet will have that information saved for an indefinite amount of time, whether it will be recorded for one year or ten. This problem has led people to question to where their information is being distributed and for how long third parties will have access to their information. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people’s</b> personal information can be distributed to other people for an indeterminate amount of time makes people very uncomfortable.|$|R
2500|$|Rush {{advocated}} for more humane mental institutions and perpetuated <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> {{with mental illness}} {{are people who have}} an illness, rather than inhuman animals.

2500|$|In reflection, Francesa said, [...] "We had 20 {{years of}} {{something}} that was great. We're linked forever. That's just life. So <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> want to paint Mike vs. Mad Dog, who's the good guy, who's the bad guy? You know what? There is no bad guy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea that}} religiosity {{arises from the}} human need for {{security}} has also been furthered by studies examining religious beliefs as a compensatory mechanism of control. These studies are motivated by <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> are invested in maintaining beliefs in order and structure to prevent beliefs in chaos and randomness ...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{abundance}} of evidence that human perception is penetrated by beliefs and expectations, scientific research so far has entirely neglected the possible impact of religious background on attention. Here we show that Dutch Calvinists and atheists, {{brought up in the}} same country and culture and controlled for race, intelligence, sex, and age, differ with respect to the way they attend to and process the global and local features of complex visual stimuli: Calvinists attend less to global aspects of perceived events, which fits with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>people’s</b> attentional processing style reflects possible biases rewarded by their religious belief system...|$|R
5000|$|His {{research}} often {{deals with}} how native {{peoples of the}} Americas changed their landscape. This {{is in contrast to}} what he calls [...] "the pristine myth," [...] <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> these <b>people</b> had minimal impact on the environment.|$|R
5000|$|German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s {{spokesman}} Steffen Seibert {{said that}} the Nobel Peace Prize is “the deserved reward for working on democracy, for sticking to <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> a <b>people</b> <b>that</b> has shaken off dictatorship deserves something better than a new dictatorship”.|$|R
