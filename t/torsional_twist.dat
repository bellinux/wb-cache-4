The model can switch between using a full FEM model for bending and torsion, or a FEM model for torsion and simple blade teeter, depending on the complexity that the user requires. The AMRA model was verified against experimental data obtained during a CAA sponsored flight test programme of the G-UNIV autogyro. Published results of modal analysis of helicopter rotor blades and other data published in open literature were used to validate the FEM model of the rotor blade. The first torsional natural frequency of the ’McCutcheon’ rotor blades was measured with the aid of high-speed camera and used for validation of the FEM model of blade <b>torsional</b> <b>twist.</b> As a further verification of the modelling method, Aérospatiale Puma helicopter rotor blade data were compared on a Southwell plot showing comparison between experimental results and AMRA estimation. The aeromechanical behaviour of the rotor during both axial flight and forward flight in autorotation was investigated. A significant part of the research was focused on investigation of the effect of different values of torsional and flexural stiffness, and the relative positions of blade shear centre/elastic axis and centre of mass of the blade on stability during the autorotation. The results obtained with the aid of the model demonstrate the interesting, and unique, characteristics of the autorotative regime - with instabilities possible in bending and torsion, but also in rotorspeed. Coupled rotor speed/flap/twist oscillations (flutter and divergence) occur if the torsional stiffness of the blade is lower than a critical value, or if the blade centre of mass is significantly aft of the blade twisting axis, {{as is the case in}} helicopter pitch-flap flutter. The instability shown here, however, is specific to the autogyro, or autorotating rotor, as it is coupled with rotorspeed, and so differs from both helicopter rotor flutter and fixed-wing flutter. The coupling with rotorspeed allows a combined flutter and divergence instability, where the rotor begins to flutter in rotorspeed, teeter angle and <b>torsional</b> <b>twist</b> and, once the rotorspeed had dropped below a critical value, then moves into divergence in flap and rotorspeed. It was found that the aeroelastic behaviour of a rotor in autorotation is significantly affected by the strong coupling of blade bending stiffness and teeter angle with rotorspeed, and the strong coupling between blade aeroelastic twist and rotor torque. </p...|$|E

Helical proteins, particularly the coiled-coils of tropomyosin, myosin and α-actinin, shorten their H-bonds cooperatively and produce torque and filament rotations when the Coulombic net-charge repulsion of their highly charged side-chains is diminished by interaction with ions. The classical “two-component model ” of active muscle differentiated a “contractile component ” which stretches the “series elastic component ” during force production. The contractile components are the helically shaped thin filaments of muscle that shorten the sarcomeres by clockwise drilling into the myosin cross-bridges with torque decrease (= force-deficit). Muscle stretch means drawing out the thin filament helices off the cross-bridges under passive counterclockwise rotation with torque increase (= stretch activation).

Since SWCNTs {{can be viewed as}} rolled up graphene sheets, our aim is to explain their torsion constants via shear mod- ulus of graphene in pristine, and single- and double vacancy cases. In addition, fundamental energy gap response to torsion is investigated. Calculations of defected structures is computationally expensive as it requires larger simula- tion cell with large number of atoms. To reduce the cost of computations we take the advantage of chiral symmetry of nanotubes instead of translational one, and faster performance of density-functional tight-binding method compared to other computational methods. Shear modulus calculations show that its value approaches that of graphene for large diameter tubes and is most sensitive to size in case of armchair tubes. Vacancies diminish shear modulus for most of the nanotubes and concentration-induced decrease has linear character regardless of chirality. Studies on direction-dependent shearing of graphene reveals that in the presence of double vacancy shear modulus has the biggest fluctuations from its average value compared to pristine and single vacancy instances. Torsion significantly modifies electronic structure as well - metallic tubes undergo tran- sition to semiconducting state, during which band gap change is linear, peaking and decreasing to zero again for most of the tubes.

40|$|Comunicación presentada en el 2 nd Early Stage Researchers Workshop in Nanoscience, celebrado en Madrid el 28 y 29 de junio de 2012. Torsional Resonance mode Atomic Force Microscopy (TR-AFM) {{has emerged}} {{during the last decade}} as a {{promising}} dynamic AFM method for imaging lateral forces. Traditional dynamic AFM modes of operation, e. g. Tapping Mode AFM (TM-AFM), employ flexural (>diving board>) cantilever oscillations. On the contrary, TR-AFM takes advantage of <b>torsional</b> (<b>twisting)</b> cantilever oscillations. In this work, TR mode Magnetic Force Microscopy (TR-MFM) measurements are presented. A double-pass method is used for performing MFM: a TM-AFM main scan yields the surface topography, while the long range magnetic forces are detected using a lifted TR-MFM scan (or a TM- MFM scan, for comparison). The main advantage of TR-MFM originates {{from the fact that the}} flexural cantilever oscillation is only excited thermally. As a consequence, the corresponding oscillation amplitude is around 1 nm, up to one order of magnitude lower than in the case of TM-MFM. This provides the ability of performing dynamic MFM measurements with significantly reduced tip-sample distance (the tip can even be lowered during the “lifted” scan). As a result, improved spatial resolution can be achieved (see figure), while preserving a high signal-to-noise ratio. Taking into account the above-mentioned advantages, it is argued that TR-MFM provides a significant improvement to a prolific magnetic imaging method. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
