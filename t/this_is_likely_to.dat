5|$|Australia also {{competed in}} the most recent tournament in 2006. There they {{finished}} in 5th position, compiling a 3–4 record. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be the last edition of the tournament for the foreseeable future.|$|E

5|$|Most of the F-FDTL's {{weapons and}} other {{equipment}} have been provided by foreign donors, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> remain {{the case in the}} future. The East Timor government has used some of the revenue it earns from the country's oil and gas sector to purchase military equipment, however. No military production currently takes place in East Timor.|$|E
5|$|Captain Blackadder's trench {{receives}} {{a phone call}} from HQ: a full-scale attack has been ordered for the next day at dawn. Realising that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> mean his death, Blackadder plans to escape by pretending to be mad: he puts underpants on his head and sticks pencils in his nostrils. His plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and remarks that he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method; Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment by pretending he is relating the story to Baldrick.|$|E
5|$|Killer whales {{have also}} been {{observed}} preying on terrestrial mammals, such as deer swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. Killer whale cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{be the result of}} scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason.|$|E

5|$|A second war in Bernicia, {{probably}} in 1018, was more successful. The Battle of Carham, by the River Tweed, {{was a victory}} for the Scots led by Malcolm II and the men of Strathclyde led by their king, Owen the Bald. By this time Earl Uchtred may have been dead, and Eiríkr Hákonarson was appointed Earl of Northumbria by his brother-in-law Cnut the Great, although his authority seems to have been limited to the south, the former kingdom of Deira, and he took no action against the Scots so far as is known. The work De obsessione Dunelmi (The siege of Durham, associated with Symeon of Durham) claims that Uchtred's brother Eadwulf Cudel surrendered Lothian to Malcolm II, presumably {{in the aftermath of the}} defeat at Carham. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been the lands between Dunbar and the Tweed as other parts of Lothian had been under Scots control before this time. It has been suggested that Cnut received tribute from the Scots for Lothian, but as he had likely received none from the Bernician Earls this is not very probable.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue fever may {{be confirmed by}} microbiological laboratory testing. This {{can be done by}} virus isolation in cell cultures, nucleic acid detection by PCR, viral antigen detection (such as for NS1) or specific antibodies (serology). Virus isolation and nucleic acid detection are more accurate than antigen detection, but these tests are not widely available due to their greater cost. Detection of NS1 during the febrile phase of a primary infection may be greater than 90% sensitive however is only 60–80% in subsequent infections. All tests may be negative {{in the early stages of}} the disease. PCR and viral antigen detection are more accurate in the first seven days. In 2012 a PCR test was introduced that can run on equipment used to diagnose influenza; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> improve access to PCR-based diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} of Youth and Pleasure was painted between 1830 and 1832, but Etty had been contemplating a {{painting}} on the theme since 1818–19. In 1822 he had exhibited an early version at the British Institution titled A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow); in this version the group of figures on the prow is reversed, and the swimmers around the boat are absent. Another rough version of the painting also survives, similar to the 1832 version but again with the figures on the prow reversed. This version was exhibited at a retrospective of Etty's work at the Society of Arts in 1849; it is dated 1848 but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be a misprint of 1828, making it a preliminary study for the 1832 painting.|$|E

50|$|The {{statistics}} in film's epilogue convey its {{importance to the}} present. The U.S. prison population had risen 300 percent since the uprising, surpassing South Africa as the biggest per capita in the world, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> worsen with the three strikes law. Forty states were currently cited by the courts for overcrowding or other inhumane conditions.|$|R

5|$|The royal {{antelope}} {{has been}} categorised as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated {{the total population}} to be about 62,000, however <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be an underestimate. The populations are feared to be declining due to habitat deterioration and expanding human settlement. A significant threat {{to the survival of}} this antelope is hunting for bushmeat; it is seldom hunted in Sierra Leone and Liberia, whereas it is a major source of bushmeat in Côte d'Ivoire. Protected areas where the royal antelope occurs include the Tai National Park, Haut Bandama Fauna and Flora Reserve and Mabi-Yaya Classified Forest (Côte d'Ivoire); Kakum National Park and Assin-Attandanso Game Production Reserve (Ghana); Ziama and Diecke Forest Reserves (Guinea); Tiwai Island and Gola Rainforest National Park (Sierra Leone).|$|E
5|$|The royal {{couple had}} at least two {{children}} together. In 1449, the King notified Ragusa {{of the birth of}} a son: <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have been Sigismund. A daughter named Catherine was born in 1453. Queen Catherine may have also been the mother of a third son of King Thomas, who was buried on Meleda. Mavro Orbini, a 16th-century Ragusan chronicler, believed that the boy was born to Vojača. If Catherine hoped that her stepson's marriage to Maria of Serbia and his subsequent accession to the Serbian throne in 1459 would pave way for her own son's accession in Bosnia, the hopes were dashed very quickly: within three months Stephen Tomašević lost the Despotate of Serbia to the Ottomans and returned to the Bosnian royal court with his wife.|$|E

50|$|BMC raced the Tour Down Under as {{the first}} non-Pro Tour team (aside from the Australian {{national}} team) to receive an invite. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> allow Evans to ride with the rainbow jersey in his home nation.
