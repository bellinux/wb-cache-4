6000|$|A {{question}} of immense importance meets us in ethical inquiries, as [...] follows: is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> {{in which it}} is needful, right, and [...] praiseworthy, that man should be much habituated to look back upon [...] himself and keep his eye upon himself; a self-regard, and even a [...] self-respect, which are compatible with the self-renunciation and [...] self-distrust which belong to Christianity? In the observance of a [...] single distinction we shall find, perhaps, a secure and sufficient [...] answer. We are to respect our responsibilities, not ourselves. We [...] are to respect the duties of which we are capable, but not our [...] capabilities simply considered. There is to be no complacent [...] self-contemplation, beruminating upon self. When self is viewed, it [...] must always be in the most intimate connection with its purposes. [...] How well were it if persons would be more careful, or rather, more [...] conscientious, in paying compliments. How often do we delude [...] another, in subject matter small or great, into the belief that he [...] has done well what we know he has done ill, either by silence, or [...] by so giving him praise on a particular point as to imply [...] approbation of the whole. Now it is undoubtedly difficult to [...] observe politeness in all cases compatibly with truth; and [...] politeness though a minor duty is a duty still. (1838.) ...|$|E
6000|$|According to this {{threefold}} division, {{it appears}} {{that there are certain}} features common to North and South Germany in which they differ from Central Germany, and the nature of this difference Riehl indicates by distinguishing the former as Centralized Land and the latter as Individualized Land; a distinction which is well symbolized by the fact that North and South Germany possess the great lines of railway which are the medium for the traffic of the world, while Middle Germany is far richer in lines for local communication, and possesses the greatest length of railway within the smallest space. Disregarding superficialities, the East Frieslanders, the Schleswig-Holsteiners, the Mecklenburghers, and the Pomeranians are much more nearly allied to the old Bavarians, the Tyrolese, and the Styrians than any of these are allied to the Saxons, the Thuringians, or the Rhinelanders. Both in North and South Germany original races are still found in large masses, and popular dialects are spoken; you still find there thoroughly peasant districts, thorough villages, and also, at great intervals, thorough cities; you still find <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of rank. In Middle Germany, on the contrary, the original races are fused together or sprinkled hither and thither; the peculiarities of the popular dialects are worn down or confused; there is no very strict line of demarkation between the country and the town population, hundreds of small towns and large villages being hardly distinguishable in their characteristics; and the sense of rank, as part of the organic structure of society, is almost extinguished. Again, both in the north and south there is still a strong ecclesiastical spirit in the people, and the Pomeranian sees Antichrist in the Pope as clearly as the Tyrolese sees him in Doctor Luther; while in Middle Germany the confessions are mingled, they exist peaceably side by side in very narrow space, and tolerance or indifference has spread itself widely even in the popular mind. And the analogy, or rather the causal relation between the physical geography of the three regions and the development of the population goes still further: ...|$|E

40|$|To be a 'commonsense realist' is to {{hold that}} perceptual {{experience}} is (in general) an immediate awareness of mind-independent objects, {{and a source of}} direct knowledge of what such objects are like. Over the past few centuries this view has faced formidable challenges from epistemology, metaphysics, and, more recently, cognitive science. However, in recent years there has been renewed interest in it, due to new work on perceptual consciousness, objectivity, and causal understanding. This volume collects nineteen original essays by leading philosophers and psychologists on these topics. Questions addressed include: What are the commitments of commonsense realism? Does it entail any particular view of the nature of perceptual experience, or any particular view of the epistemology of perceptual knowledge? Should we think of commonsense realism as a view held by some philosophers, or is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> in which we are pre-theoretically committed to commonsense realism in virtue of the experience we enjoy or the concepts we use or the explanations we give? Is commonsense realism defensible, and if so how, {{in the face of the}} formidable criticism it faces? Specific issues addressed in the philosophical essays include the status of causal requirements on perception, the causal role of perceptual experience, and the relation between objective perception and causal thinking. The scientific essays present a range of perspectives on the development, phylogenetic and ontogenetic, of the human adult conception of perception...|$|E
40|$|A gambler {{walks into}} a {{hypothetical}} fair casino with a very real dollar bill, {{but by the time}} he leaves he's exchanged the dollar for a random amount of money. What is lost in the process? It may be that the gambler walks out at the end of the day, after a roller-coaster ride of winning and losing, with his dollar still intact, or maybe even with two dollars. But what the gambler loses the moment he places his first bet is position. He exchanges one distribution of money for a distribution of lesser quality, from which he cannot return. Our first discussion in this work connects known results of economic inequality and majorization to the probability theory of gambling and Martingales. We provide a simple proof that fair gambles cannot increase the Lorenz curve, and we also constructively demonstrate that any sequence of non-increasing Lorenz curves corresponds to at least one Martingale. We next consider the efficiency of gambles. If all fair gambles are available then one can move down the lattice of distributions defined by the Lorenz ordering. However, the step from one distribution to the next is not unique. Is <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of efficiency with which one can move down the Lorenz stream? One approach would be to minimize the average total volume of money placed on the table. In this case, it turns out that implementing part of the strategy using private randomness can help reduce the need for the casino's randomness, resulting in less money on the table that the casino cannot get its hands on.

40|$|Abstract. Despite the {{importance}} of distance learning {{for its ability to}} reach a wide audience, easiness to access materials, and its lower cost compared to traditional learning, architecture education has not been well served by distance education. This is because it has a higher level of learning objectives, it is taught by coaching methodologies, and involves nonverbal forms of communication. One of the most common learning methods used in the design studio is the Criticism/Critique, which is a graphic and oral type of communication between the tutor and the students. In this investigation, Second Life, a massive multi-user online virtual environment that offers three-dimensional spatial capabilities via Avatars impersonation, is used as a computer-mediated tool for text and graphic-based communication in a distance learning situation. The study describes a demonstration experiment where students had to communicate with their tutor, display and describe their projects at a distance, in a purposely designed criticism space in SecondLife. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} observe and document the effects and the use of SecondLife virtual environment as an online 3 D graphical-based tool of computer-mediated communication in distance learning in architecture education. The study also answers some questions: How well did the students use the tools of the medium provide? Was <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of personal communication and realism gained through using Avatars in the virtual environment? Did SecondLife provide a successful means of communication for a graphic-based context? And what are the students ’ opinions about the learning environment? Using multiple methods of data collection, mainly based on an electronic observation of the experiment, questioning the participants before and after the experiment, and the analysis of the chat transcripts, the study presents descriptive results of the experiment, and discusses its main features. Proposals for modifications are made for future replications. 18 R. ABDELLATIF AND C. CALDERON...|$|E
