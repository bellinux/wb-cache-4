500|$|McConnell's work {{mainly focused}} on poison and blood analysis, and she testified in many {{criminal}} cases {{as an expert}} witness. Her work often involved determining {{the cause of death}} when poisoning was suspected. In 1930, she investigated the death of a ten-year-old Denver girl; the case was referred to at the time as the city's [...] "most famous and controversial murder case". Although she initially suspected the girl had been poisoned, McConnell discovered crushed glass in the girl's stomach and blood stains in the family car; her testimony led to the sentencing of the girl's stepmother for murder. In 1936, McConnell testified against suspected rapist and murderer Joe Arridy after finding fibers from <b>the</b> <b>bedspread</b> at the murder scene under the suspect's fingernails. (Although Arridy was convicted of murder and executed in 1939, he was granted a posthumous pardon in 2011.) McConnell also discovered that murder victim Georg Obendoerfer had been killed with a lethal dose of arsenic, which led to further investigations confirming that Anna Marie Hahn had killed Obendoerfer, as well as other men in the same way. McConnell testified at Hahn's trial in Cincinnati and Hahn was subsequently convicted and executed. After she was called to Raton, New Mexico as a key witness in a murder trial in 1935, a court reporter for the Raton Range wrote that McConnell [...] "has gained a national reputation ... in her blood analysis work". Additionally, she is thought to be the United States' first female forensic pathologist. Despite working on numerous high-profile, widely publicized cases, McConnell kept her life as private as possible and only ever gave one interview during her career.|$|E

5000|$|Yuyi Morales {{was born}} in the city of Xalapa in the Mexican State of Veracruz in 1968. She is the oldest of four children. As a child she loved drawing, and often paired her {{pictures}} with stories. Her mother was a homemaker, “She made all our clothes, coats, hats, underwear. She made <b>the</b> <b>bedspreads,</b> <b>the</b> curtains, the lamps, everything,” Morales recalls. “She taught me to use the sewing machine when I was very little. I crocheted a vest for myself when I was five years old." [...] Despite those nights by the sewing machine, becoming an artist was not a childhood dream for Morales. “That would have been thought of as crazy,” she says. Because she had been a top competitive swimmer in high school, she studied physical education at the Universidad de Xalapa, hoping to teach gym. After graduation, she {{took a job as a}} swim coach.|$|R

6000|$|He {{had brought}} her at Hythe one day a popular Victorian device, a {{confession}} album, {{in which she had}} had to write down on a neat rose-tinted page, her favourite author, her favourite flower, her favourite colour, her favourite hero in real life, her [...] "pet aversion," [...] and quite a number of such particulars of her subjective existence. She had filled this page in a haphazard manner late one night, and she was disconcerted to find how thoroughly her careless replies had come home to roost. She had put down [...] "pink" [...] as her favourite colour because the page she was writing upon suggested it, and the paper of the room was pale pink, the curtains strong pink with a pattern of paler pink and tied with large pink bows, and the lamp shades, <b>the</b> <b>bedspread,</b> the pillow-cases, the carpet, the chairs, the very crockery--everything but the omnipresent perennial sunflowers--was pink. Confronted with this realization, she understood that pink was the least agreeable of all possible hues for a bedroom. She perceived she had to live now in a chromatic range between rather underdone mutton and salmon. She had said that her favourite musical composers were Bach and Beethoven; she really meant it, and a bust of Beethoven materialized that statement, but she had made Doctor Barnardo her favourite hero in real life because his name also began with a B and she had heard someone say somewhere that he was a very good man. The predominance of George Eliot's pensive rather than delightful countenance in her bedroom and the array of all that lady's works in a lusciously tooled pink leather, was due to her equally reckless choice of a favourite author. She had said too that Nelson was her favourite historical character, but Sir Isaac with a delicate jealousy had preferred to have this heroic but regrettably immoral personality represented in his home only by an engraving of the Battle of Copenhagen....|$|E

The thought of what her own best bedroom would be like delighted her fancy. It was a lovely room, for Béla's house was larger by far than his sister's, the rooms were wider and more lofty, and the windows had large, clear panes of glass in them. She would have two beautiful bedsteads in the room, and <b>the</b> <b>bedspreads</b> would be piled up to the ceiling with down pillows and duvets covered in scarlet twill; she would have two beautiful spreads of crochet-work, a washstand with marble top, and white crockery, and there would be a stencilling of rose garlands on the colour-washed walls.|$|R

60|$|It {{was rough}} and simple, and not unlike what baby bears {{would have made}} of an {{underground}} house in the same circumstances. But there was one recess in the wall, {{no larger than a}} bird-cage, which was the private apartment of Tinker Bell. It could be shut {{off from the rest of}} the home by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious, always kept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman, however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir and bedchamber combined. The couch, as she always called it, was a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and she varied <b>the</b> <b>bedspreads</b> according to what fruit-blossom was in season. Her mirror was a Puss-in-boots, of which there are now only three, unchipped, known to the fairy dealers; the wash-stand was Pie-crust and reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and the carpet and rugs of the best (the early) period of Margery and Robin. There was a chandelier from Tiddly winks for the look of the thing, but of course she lit the residence herself. Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps inevitable; and her chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up.|$|R

5000|$|Called the [...] "novelist of the newsroom," [...] Jha's {{fiction is}} known for its stark {{simplicity}} and ability to evoke emotion through attention to detail. [...] "Not everyone’s kind of tales, they are dense and surreal, contain dark, brooding, even repugnant elements," [...] said OPEN (magazine). John Fowles described <b>The</b> Blue <b>Bedspread</b> as <b>the</b> [...] "Coming of age of the Indian novel." [...] His fiction is strongly grounded in contemporary themes around change, often taking off from newspaper pages. From domestic violence to the urban-rural divide, from inequality and intolerance to vulnerability of the marginalised, Jha's books engage with disturbing subjects unusual in Indian contemporary fiction in English. His writing, simple as it appears, calls for a lot of reader participation which evokes sharp, divided reaction.|$|R

Cotton is spun and woven mostly to create clothing and linens—including dresses, shirts, blouses, jackets, tablecloths, table runners, napkins, and <b>bedspreads.</b> <b>The</b> most representative work in cotton comes from Patzcuaro and Uruapan, as well as Zacán and Tócuaro.
