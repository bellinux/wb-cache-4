5|$|On 31 October 1728, a {{few weeks}} after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford as a fellow-commoner. The {{inheritance}} did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit. Corbet left Pembroke soon after Johnson arrived, so this source of aid disappeared. To meet the expenses, Michael Johnson allowed his son <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> hundred books from his bookshop, at a great cost to himself, and these books were not fully returned to Michael until many years later.|$|E
5|$|Margaret's {{mother is}} falling ill. Mrs. Hale desires {{to see her}} son, Frederick (Rupert Evans), before she dies. Frederick, a naval officer, was {{involved}} in a mutiny and he cannot return to England without risking his life. However, without telling her father, Margaret writes to her brother in Cádiz, Spain, to tell him that their mother is dying. Margaret calls on the Thorntons <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> water mattress for her mother and is trapped while mill workers riot during a strike. When the angry mob threatens John's safety as he confronts them after Margaret's goading, Margaret defends him from the rioters and is injured by a thrown stone.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Reid orchestrated a quick {{transfer}} of power. The Social Credit victory had provoked a bank run, {{and he wanted}} to re-establish stability as quickly as possible. Moreover, the province needed <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> large sum of money to meet even its short-term obligations, and the UFA, as a lame duck government, was unable to make promises to would-be creditors. Once in office, confronted with a dire financial situation, Aberhart accused the UFA government of mismanagement. Reid responded in January 1936 that there had been no such mismanagement, that the province's financial problems were due to Social Credit's policies, both real and promised, and that had the UFA won re-election in 1935 it could have continued governing without serious difficulty. He also resisted insinuations that it had been too restrained in helping impoverished farmers: as late as 1969 he was offering the view that shrinking sources of provincial revenue made further assistance impossible.|$|E

25|$|In later years, she {{was seen}} {{outside in the}} garden alone, and Přiklopil's {{business}} partner has said that Kampusch seemed relaxed and happy when she and Přiklopil called at his home <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> trailer. After her eighteenth birthday, she was allowed {{to leave the house}} with Přiklopil, but her kidnapper threatened to kill her if she made any noise. He later took her on a skiing trip to a resort near Vienna for a few hours. She initially denied that they had made the trip, but eventually admitted that it was true, although she said she had no chance to escape during that time.|$|E
25|$|On 3 October 1968, {{at the age}} of 15, Dupas, still {{attending}} school in Waverley High in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Mount Waverley, visited his next-door neighbour, requesting <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> knife for the purpose of peeling vegetables. Dupas was apprehended after he stabbed the woman in the face, neck, and hand as she attempted to fight off his attack. He later told police he could not help himself and did not know why he began to attack the woman. He was placed on 18 months probation and admitted to the Larundel Psychiatric Hospital for evaluation; he was released after two weeks and treated as an outpatient.|$|E

25|$|In {{his next}} fight, Aerts faced fellow K-1 legend Ernesto Hoost (the fifth and final {{meeting between the}} pair) at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2006 in Amsterdam on May 13, 2006. The {{circumstances}} surrounding the match were rather bizarre as Hoost was scheduled to face Bob Sapp that night and Aerts was only there to commentate for television. However, Sapp ran from the Amsterdam ArenA and Aerts stepped in to replace him, and had <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> pair of fighting shorts from Semmy Schilt (which had Schilt's name written on them and displayed the Golden Glory gym's logo). Despite having not trained for the fight, Aerts {{was still able to}} last all three rounds with Hoost and lost a majority decision (30-29, 30-28, 30-30).|$|E
25|$|In autumn 1903 Childers {{travelled}} to the United States {{as part of}} {{a reciprocal}} visit between the Honourable Artillery Company of London and the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts of Boston. At the end of the official visit he elected to remain and explore New England on a hired motor cycle. One day by chance the machine broke down outside the Beacon Hill home of Dr Hamilton Osgood, a prominent physician in the city. Childers diffidently knocked <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> spanner and was invited in for dinner and introduced to Dr Osgood's younger daughter, Mary ("Molly") Alden Osgood. The well-read republican heiress and Childers found each other congenial company. Dr Osgood organised the rest of Childers's stay, with much time shared with Molly, and the pair were married at Boston's Trinity Church on 5 January 1904.|$|E
25|$|Columbo's {{wardrobe}} {{was personally}} provided by Peter Falk; {{they were his}} own clothes, including the high-topped shoes and the shabby raincoat, which made its first appearance in Prescription: Murder. Falk would often ad lib his character's idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his pockets {{for a piece of}} evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the room at a dramatic point in a conversation with a suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused and impatient reactions to Columbo's antics more genuine. Some of the episodes established that Columbo carried a Colt snub-nosed revolver in his raincoat, which he pulled in rare episodes, and would occasionally remark that his wife, 'the Mrs.', would not allow him to buy a new car because it 'wasn't necessary', portraying the detective throughout the series as permanently driving an aged and battered 1959 Peugeot 403 Cabriolet.|$|E

25|$|On 4 July 1945 the {{regiment}} loaded its tanks onto transporters {{and set off}} for Berlin {{to take part in}} the victory parade. The regiment was based at the Olympic Stadium in the newly designated British Sector. At the first opportunity and before orders were issued prohibiting such activities he and some fellow officers were able <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> jeep and explore the administrative heart of the capital. They visited the burnt out shell of the Reichstag first and then went on to the Reich Chancellery which was looted and severely damaged in the fighting but largely intact. In Adolf Hitler's study only his desk remained. They tried to gain access to the gardens at the rear but the Russians had placed a guard on it and forbade them exploring it. They were however, able to grab some souvenirs from the detritus in the building in the form of several small etchings and cards which contained Christmas greetings from the Führer.|$|E
25|$|The {{loans from}} Chiang {{were to be}} repaid with the {{proceeds}} {{from the sale of}} the flat. Following this, Mislia asked for two more loans from Chiang, which Shankar helped to arrange. In total, she signed three agreements <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> sum of $88,500, consisting of $45,000, $30,000 and $13,500 on three separate occasions. However, Mislia claimed she only received $40,000, consisting of $25,000, $10,000 and $5,000 on each of the occasions. Four years later, the complainants lodged a complaint against Shankar with the Law Society of Singapore. Following an investigation, Shankar was tried by the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society and convicted of three counts of grossly improper conduct contrary to section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act. The charges were based on allegations that Shankar had acted for both the complainants and Chiang without advising the complainants of the consequences of this conflict of interest, that he had not taken full instructions from the complainants, that he had asked the complainants to sign documents without properly explaining their effect, and that he had not ascertained whether the sums of money that Chiang paid to Mislia were in line with the loan agreements.|$|E
25|$|In Santafé de Bogotá, {{capital of}} the Viceroyalty, word arrived of the events in Cartagena, and of {{the arrival of the}} Regency Commissioner Villavicencio in that city. The people of Santafé had been waiting anxiously for his arrival, as they hoped it would further their drive for independence. On the morning of July 20, 1810, Joaquín Camacho visited the Viceroy Antonio José Amar y Borbón to see if his request to open a cabildo had been granted, but the viceroy {{dismissed}} the idea with arrogance. This caused the revolutionaries to begin devising a plot to launch their revolution. Using the arrival of Villavicencio as an excuse, they went to the house of José Gonzales Llorente <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> flower vase; he refused, and insulted them as well. Francisco José de Caldas seized on this incident to incite the crowds {{to stand up to the}} Peninsulars, forcing José Miguel Pey, the mayor of Bogotá, to step in and save Llorente. By that night the situation had heated up so much that a special Cabildo was called in session. This led to its issuing the declaration of independence of New Granada from Spain.|$|E

[...] Madgwick had assumed that it would take at least two years to get the new department up and running. [...] McClymont, however, pointed out to Madgwick that the program could begin accepting enrollments in 1956 because the existing faculty of science could already offer first-year courses in several basic science topics needed for the degree program.|$|E
500|$|Leng {{has named}} Living in the Material World as his {{personal}} favourite {{of all of}} Harrison's solo albums. According to Leng, with its combination of a defiant [...] "protest" [...] song in [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round", the anti-stardom [...] "The Lord Loves the One", and [...] "perfect pop confections" [...] in [...] "Give Me Love" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long", Living in the Material World was the last album to capture the same clear-sighted, utopian spirit that characterised the 1960s. Eder likewise welcomes Material Worlds bold idealism, saying: [...] "Even {{in the summer of}} 1973, after years of war and strife and disillusionment, some of us were still sort of looking – <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>a</b> phrase from a Lennon–McCartney song – or hoping to get from them something like 'the word' that would make us free.
