5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site, {{the south}} façade, which overlooks {{the main part}} of the grounds, stands on a raised and terraced {{platform}} with the ground floor raised to first floor level and the basement becoming the ground floor. Above the terrace, the façade has the same general arrangement as the north façade, but the wings project slightly past the central section, which has a two-storey pedimented portico. Each wing previously had a single-storey bay at its centre but these have been removed.|$|E

5|$|The breed {{standards}} of the Australian, American and Canadian kennel clubs specify that the Australian Cattle Dog should have a natural, long, un-docked tail. There will often be a solid colour spot {{at the base of}} the tail and a white tip. The tail should be set moderately low, following <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back. It should hang in a slight curve at rest, though an excited dog may carry its tail higher. The tail should feature a reasonable level of brush.|$|E
5|$|The gardens {{behind the}} house may {{originally}} have resembled the gardens at Bodysgallen Hall, which were {{laid out in the}} Renaissance style popular across Europe. <b>The</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land results in Plas Mawr's gardens forming the upper and lower terraces, and these have been replanted and restored in an attempt to show them as they might have appeared in 1665.

5|$|The joint {{production}} possibilities {{set at the}} extreme right shows {{the total amount of}} both commodities that can be produced by Crusoe and Friday together. It combines the best of both workers. If both of them work to gather coconuts only, the economy will have 144 coconuts in all, 96 from Crusoe and 48 from Friday. (This can be obtained by setting F=0 in their respective PPF equations and summing them up). Here <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> joint PPF is -1/2.|$|E

5|$|Clearances around Albion Hill {{began in}} the 1950s. From 1959, the narrow, densely {{populated}} terraces between Albion Hill and Morley Street were cleared and replaced with landscaped open space and seven tower blocks—Brighton's first such buildings. The first, Highleigh, opened on 11 May 1961. Like its later neighbours, it has 11 storeys. The steep Richmond Street was severed {{as part of this}} redevelopment; its lower section was replaced by a zig-zag path down the hillside and a short road called Richmond Parade, and new roads (Grove Hill and Ashton Rise) were built between the tower blocks and across <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill. Similarly, the lowest section of Carlton Hill was renamed Kingswood Street when it was redeveloped in the 1960s: Brighton Art College (now part of the University of Brighton) was extended in 1967 by Brighton borough architect Percy Billington, taking up a large corner plot.|$|E
5|$|From the Sea of Marmara, {{the wall}} turns sharply to the northeast, {{until it reaches}} the Golden Gate, at about 14m above sea level. From there and until the Gate of Rhegion the wall follows {{a more or less}} {{straight}} line to the north, climbing the city's Seventh Hill. From there the wall turns sharply to the northeast, climbing up to the Gate of St. Romanus, located near the peak of the Seventh Hill at some 68m above sea level. From there the wall descends into the valley of the river Lycus, where it reaches its lowest point at 35m above sea level. Climbing <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sixth Hill, the wall then rises up to the Gate of Charisius or Gate of Adrianople, at some 76m height. From the Gate of Adrianople to the Blachernae, the walls fall to a level of some 60 m. From there the later walls of Blachernae project sharply to the west, reaching the coastal plain at the Golden Horn near the so-called Prisons of Anemas.|$|E
5|$|If we {{want more}} fish, we should shift that person who has a {{comparative}} advantage in fish hunting (i.e. Friday) out of coconut gathering and into fish hunting. When Friday is producing 96 pounds of fish, he is fully occupied. If fish production is to be increased beyond this point, Crusoe will have to start hunting fish. Here onward, <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> joint PPF is -2. If we want to produce only fish, then the economy will have 144 pounds of fish, 48 from Crusoe and 96 from Friday. Thus the joint PPF is kinked because Crusoe and Friday have comparative advantages in different commodities. As the economy gets more and more ways of producing output and different comparative advantages, the PPF becomes concave.|$|E

Stevenson's brigade advanced well in two columns against the redoubt, but their attack also failed when they found their ladders were too short to scale the fortification. Brig. Gen. Isaac F. Quinby's division advanced a few hundred yards, but halted for hours while its generals engaged in confused discussions.|$|E
5|$|The building's western façade has {{a central}} {{entryway}} with double doors, {{topped by a}} six-light transom and flanked by engaged pilasters.

5|$|The {{name of the}} bastion {{refers to}} {{the faces of the}} {{fortification}} and not to <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground on which it was built; Flat Bastion was constructed on sloping ground. A 1908 map of the Flat Bastion confirms that its south faces join at an obtuse angle which is relatively flat, and nearly parallel to the Charles V Wall. Flat Bastion includes Flat Bastion Magazine within its eastern portion, now a geological research and exhibition facility. The bastion is a listed building with the Gibraltar Heritage Trust. While St. Jago's Bastion has been said to be an early name for Flat Bastion, it has a separate listing with the Gibraltar Heritage Trust, next to those for Flat Bastion and Flat Bastion Magazine.|$|E

Along <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mayon Volcano, 2,600people had to be evacuated due to a landslide. On the remote island of Palawan, 74people were killed. Elsewhere, most towns in the Capiz province on Panay Island were flooded. Two people were killed and more than 700people were evacuated from the Aklan province. In the Iloilo province, on the eastern portion of Panay Island, almost 40villages were under water and nearby roads were impassable. Seventeen homes were demolished, and two people were confirmed to have been killed because of a landslide in Pasacao in the province of Camarines Sur. Throughout the city, ten people perished. Throughout the province, up to 27people died and at least 20others were hurt. In the suburbs of Manila, thirteen people drowned, all in three suburbs, but city proper itself avoided the worst impact from Skip. Overall, 237people were killed {{as a result of the}} typhoon while 35other people were injured. Throughout the country, damaged totaled $131.8million (1988USD).|$|E
5|$|While the 1976 renovations {{prolonged}} {{the life}} of the 1930s market, by the 1990s the market was once more becoming decrepit. The covers erected in 1976 over the walkways blocked sunlight, leaving much of the market dingy and poorly lit. The walkways themselves, already narrow, were becoming even more restricted as stalls erected external displays and additional weatherproofing. Removable shutters used to secure the stalls overnight were stacked against the sides of the stalls during trading hours, causing further obstruction, while on those stalls fitted with doors the doors opened outwards to maximise the limited space inside the units. In addition, the floors of stalls followed <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill, a gradient of about 1:12, causing health problems for those market workers who had to stand at this angle for prolonged periods during the day. Norwich City Council decided that these problems needed to be addressed, and in December 2003 invited the public to choose between three proposals for a rebuilt market.|$|E
5|$|Based on a {{courtyard}} house layout, externally the harled whinstone rubble mansion {{is a combination}} of Elizabethan and Jacobean (or Gothic) design, similar to Smith's work at Slains. A spacious central courtyard is surrounded by buildings three storeys high. Within the back of the courtyard, circular towers enclose the service stairways. A large Elizabethan-style tower housing the main stairway is also set within the courtyard but sited to the front behind the reception rooms. Other external features include: canted and box bays; a variety of lofty towers that are round, square or octagonal; many different gables; and numerous diagonally set stone flues. The southeast facing front elevation lacks symmetry with the main Tudor style entranceway set off centre and extending out. A plaque commemorating the building dates of 1839–1842 and a central armorial are above the round arched entrance. There is also an eight-sided tower positioned at the front corner. A separate driveway accesses the outside kitchen yard {{at the back of the}} north west elevation. This side of the mansion is plainer, more restrained and built into <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hillside. A lengthy one storey lean-to houses fuel supplies and servants toilets and provides additional ground support. The northeast elevation is also more architecturally reserved than the front.|$|E

5|$|His {{observations}} on the part played by organisms {{in the formation of}} the various features of reefs anticipated modern studies. To establish the thickness of coral barrier reefs, he relied on the old nautical rule of thumb to project <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land to that below sea level, and then applied his idea that the coral reef would slope much more steeply than the underlying land. He was fortunate to guess that the maximum depth of coral would be around 5,000ft (1,500m), as the first test bores conducted by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on Enewetak Atoll in 1952 drilled down through 4610ft (1,405m) of coral before reaching the volcanic foundations. In Darwin's time no comparable thickness of fossil coral had been found on the continents, and when this was raised as a criticism of his theory neither he nor Lyell could find a satisfactory explanation. It is now thought that fossil reefs are usually broken up by tectonic movements, but at least two continental fossil reef complexes have been discovered to be about 3,000ft (1,000m) thick. While these findings have confirmed his argument that the islands were subsiding, his other attempts to show evidence of subsidence have been superseded by the discovery that glacial effects can cause changes in sea level.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensions}} from Rickmansworth to Aylesbury and Chesham {{were designed}} by Charles Liddell and built by contractor James Firbank. Rather than follow {{the valley of the}} River Chess, which would have been the most convenient route to Chesham, the route out of Rickmansworth was intentionally built on higher ground to reduce the steep climb over the Chilterns towards Aylesbury, and thus rose steadily from Rickmansworth to a hilltop station at Amersham. At Chalfont Road station (renamed Chalfont& Latimer in 1915) the line to Chesham split from the line to Aylesbury. With a total length of 3miles 56chains (3mi 1,232yd; 5,955m), the single-track Chesham branch ran alongside the Aylesbury line for a short distance, before curving down <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chess Valley at a gradient of around 1 in 66. Chalk from the railway's cutting along the Chess Valley was used to build an embankment to bring the railway into the town centre. Bridging the watercress beds of the Chess Valley proved problematic, and the cost of the line exceeded its estimate. Additional costs were incurred by the laying of temporary track in early 1889 to allow the directors of the MR a trial trip along the route.|$|E
