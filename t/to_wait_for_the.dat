5|$|Gunnery {{developments}} in the late 1890s and the early 1900s, led in the United Kingdom by Percy Scott and in the United States by William Sims, were already pushing expected battle ranges out to an unprecedented , a distance great enough to force gunners <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> shells to arrive before applying corrections for the next salvo. A related {{problem was that the}} shell splashes from the more numerous smaller weapons tended to obscure the splashes from the bigger guns. Either the smaller-calibre guns would have to hold their fire <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> slower-firing heavies, losing the advantage of their faster rate of fire, or it would be uncertain whether a splash was due to a heavy or a light gun, making ranging and aiming unreliable. Another problem was that longer-range torpedoes were expected to soon be in service and these would discourage ships from closing to ranges where the smaller guns' faster rate of fire would become preeminent. Keeping the range open generally negated the threat from torpedoes and further reinforced the need for heavy guns of a uniform calibre.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) {{prepares to}} take the Academy {{entrance}} exam himself. He succeeds in passing several parts of the exam, and helps Mordock (John Putch), a highly talented Benzite and fellow competitor, to solve a difficult test problem {{so that they may}} both advance. Wesley is worried about the psychological part of the exam, and he is directed to a room <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> test to start.|$|E

50|$|On 1 September 2002, the Fourth transitioned {{into its}} final on-call air expeditionary wing. Though the 4th Fighter Wing will {{continue}} as a lead wing when deployed, it will now assimilate into the more predictable 90-day 10 AEF schedule, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> call from higher headquarters.|$|R
50|$|Joseph Nasi is {{best known}} to history for his attempt to resettle the towns of Tiberias and Safed in 1561. He {{was the first person}} to attempt to settle Jews in the cities of what was then Southern Syria by {{practical}} means, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Messiah.|$|R
5|$|The British {{commander-in-chief}} in North America, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, had forbidden any offensive {{action on}} the Niagara Frontier. This left the local British forces with no alternative but <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Americans {{to make the first}} move and try to counter any attempt at invasion. The regular troops were distributed among the defensive outposts and supplemented with militia and Native American forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{transport}} convoy reached Guadalcanal {{and successfully}} unloaded its cargo on 30–31 January. The rest of Halsey's warships took {{station in the}} Coral Sea south of the Solomons <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> approach of any Japanese warship forces supporting what the Allies believed to be an imminent offensive. The departure of TF18 from the Guadalcanal area removed a significant potential threat to the Ke operation.|$|E
5|$|After the disappointing {{end to the}} season, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that front-office changes were coming. In the end, GM Marshall Johnston retired, but Martin and Mlakar were re-signed. John Muckler was hired on June 12, 2002, the Senators' sixth GM, and the first with previous experience as a general manager (with Buffalo). He had been interested in the Ottawa job in 1991, but he chose not <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Senators to make him an offer, and he joined the Sabres organization.|$|E
2500|$|Blade Runner was {{advertised as}} a [...] "real-time 3D {{adventure}} game," [...] {{since it was}} one of the first adventure games to use both 3D character rendering and a game world which progressed in real-time (as opposed <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> player's actions). Unlike many games of its time, which used polygon-based renderers exploiting 3D accelerators, Westwood opted for their own software-based renderer using voxel technology.|$|R

5|$|By the {{following}} year Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio have mostly recovered, having moved far away and turned to religion. Bian Koen, however, remains suicidal, and intends {{to go to war}} in China to find death; the only thing restraining him is his promise <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> anniversary of Lily's death. One day, as he is passing through the village of Cikembang, he finds a well-kept grave. As he examines the area, he sees a woman who he thinks is Lily. She rejects his embrace and runs away. When Bian Koen chases her, he falls and passes out.|$|E
5|$|In Book Two, Jake {{is joined}} by Bill Gorton, {{recently}} arrived from New York, and Brett's fiancé Mike Campbell, who arrives from Scotland. Jake and Bill travel south and meet Robert Cohn at Bayonne for a fishing trip in the hills northeast of Pamplona. Instead of fishing, Cohn stays in Pamplona <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> overdue Brett and Mike. Cohn {{had an affair with}} Brett a few weeks earlier and still feels possessive of her despite her engagement to Mike. After Jake and Bill enjoy five days of fishing the streams near Burguete, they rejoin the group in Pamplona.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{benefit of}} the TRIM command depends upon the free user space on the SSD. If the user {{capacity}} on the SSD was 100GB and the user actually saved 95GB of data to the drive, any TRIM operation would not add more than 5GB of free space for garbage collection and wear leveling. In those situations, {{increasing the amount of}} over-provisioning by 5GB would allow the SSD to have more consistent performance because it would always have the additional 5GB of additional free space without having <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> TRIM command to come from the OS.|$|E

5|$|The embassy party {{left behind}} in Canton in 1518 {{proceeded}} north in January 1520 {{with the rest of}} the Portuguese under Tomé Pires and Fernão Pires de Andrade. The embassy reached Nanjing, where the Zhengde Emperor was touring in May 1520, granting the Portuguese embassy a quick audience. However, further diplomatic negotiations were to be resumed once the emperor returned to Beijing; hence, the Portuguese embassy was sent there <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> emperor's return.|$|E
5|$|Around {{ten days}} later, the Persian army arrived at Thermopylae, and the Allies at Chalcis were {{informed}} by a ship, captained by Abronichus, {{which had been}} appointed to liaise between {{the army and the}} fleet. However, there was still no sign of the Persian fleet, and the first day the Persians spent at Thermopylae passed without them launching an attack. The next day, the Persian fleet finally drew near to Artemisium, heading for the Gap of Skiathos (between the coast of Magnesia and Skiathos), when a summer gale (a 'Hellesponter' - probably a north-easterly storm) broke, driving the Persian fleet onto the mountainous coast. The storm lasted two days, wrecking approximately one third of the Persian ships. Meanwhile, at Thermopylae, the Persians had continued <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Greeks to disperse, also choosing not to attack during the storm.|$|E
5|$|Emus drink infrequently, but ingest {{large amounts}} when the {{opportunity}} arises. They typically drink once a day, first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink. They prefer being on firm ground while drinking, rather than on rocks or mud, but if they sense danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the scarcity of water sources, emus are sometimes forced to go without water for several days. In the wild, they often share water holes with kangaroos, other birds and animals; they are wary and tend <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other animals to leave before they quench their thirst.|$|E

5|$|For the Australians, {{the attack}} had been successful, {{as they had}} gained {{possession}} of the main Ottoman line, and after being halted at The Cup they began preparing to defend their gains. Hastily erecting sandbag barriers along the parapet, they settled down <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first counterattack. As they did so, the brigade reserve—the 1st Battalion—was brought up. Due to crowding in the tunnels {{that had been used}} for the attack, the reinforcements were sent via the open ground that had been in front of the old Ottoman positions; despite being behind the recently captured position, the ground was still subjected to heavy Ottoman artillery and machine-gun fire, which was being poured down from positions in overwatch on the flanks. Nevertheless, in company lots, the 1st Battalion moved up and began filling in the gaps between the assault battalions, while engineers from the 2nd Field Company began the task of extending the tunnels from The Pimple towards the new Australian line.|$|E
5|$|In Asia Minor, Conrad {{decided not}} <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> French, and marched towards Iconium, {{capital of the}} Seljuq Sultanate of Rûm. Conrad split his army into two divisions. Much of the {{authority}} of the Byzantine Empire in the western provinces of Asia Minor was more nominal than real, with much of the provinces being a no-man's land controlled by Turkish nomads. Conrad underestimated the length of the march against Anatolia, and anyhow assumed that the authority of Emperor Manuel was greater in Anatolia than was in fact the case. Conrad took the knights and the best troops with himself to march overland while sending the camp followers with Otto of Freising to follow the coastal road. The king led one of these, which was almost totally destroyed by the Seljuqs on 25 October 1147 at the second battle of Dorylaeum.|$|E
5|$|On hearing Donnelly's report, Duncan {{immediately}} despatched a small squadron to {{the mouth}} of the Texel <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the Batavian squadron. Command of this squadron was given to Captain Lawrence Halstead in the 36gun frigate HMS Phoenix, accompanied by Pegasus, Sylph and the 50gun fourth rate HMS Leopard. The squadron detached at 05:00 and almost immediately the Batavian squadron was sighted to the southeast, heading for the entrance to the Texel, tacking against the northwest wind. Halstead's force was not unified, with Pegasus and Sylph far ahead of Phoenix and Leopard, and the British commander decided to deliberately detach his forces, the faster Pegasus and Sylph pursuing the brigs under Donnelly's command and Halstead's rear force attacking the frigate Argo. Duncan's main fleet, some distance behind Halstead, also sighted the Batavian squadron and joined the chase.|$|E
50|$|Many {{software}} {{systems are}} event-driven, {{which means that}} they continuously <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> occurrence of some external or internal event such as a mouse click, a button press, a time tick, or an arrival of a data packet. After recognizing the event, such systems react by performing the appropriate computation that may include manipulating the hardware or generating “soft” events that trigger other internal software components. (That’s why event-driven systems are alternatively called reactive systems.) Once the event handling is complete, the system goes back <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next event.|$|R

5|$|On taking office, Reagan {{was faced}} with the same {{decision}} as Carter before: whether {{to continue with the}} B-1 for the short term, or <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of the ATB, a much more advanced aircraft. Studies suggested that the existing B-52 fleet with ALCM would remain a credible threat until 1985. It was predicted that 75% of the B-52 force would survive to attack its targets. After this, the introduction of the SA-10 missile, the MiG-31 interceptor and the first Soviet Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) systems would make the B-52 increasingly vulnerable. During 1981, funds were allocated to a new study for a bomber for the 1990s time-frame which led to developing the Long-Range Combat Aircraft (LRCA) project. The LRCA evaluated the B-1, F-111, and ATB as possible solutions; an emphasis was placed on multi-role capabilities, as opposed to purely strategic operations.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} topics of debate after 's rampage became the way police dealt with him, {{especially}} whether the first two responding officers were, under the circumstances, supposed to immediately engage and neutralize the perpetrator, and whether the decision <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> arrival of the tactical unit was sound. The debate became more vocal after a cook, who managed to escape the rampage, claimed that she heard a slow series of single shots coming from the restaurant after the police had retreated. Another witness, who escaped unharmed, refuted this version of events, saying that shots were fired only during the initial ten minutes {{leading up to the}} point of police entry, with no shots heard thereafter.|$|E
5|$|That night, Castelli and Saavedra {{informed}} Cisneros {{of their}} resignation from {{the newly formed}} Junta. They explained that the population {{was on the verge}} of violent revolution and would remove Cisneros by force if he did not resign as well. They warned that they did not have the power to stop that: neither Castelli to stop his friends, nor Saavedra to prevent the Regiment of Patricians from mutiny. Cisneros wanted <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> following day, but they said that there was no time for further delays, so he finally agreed to resign. He sent a resignation letter to the Cabildo for consideration on the following day. Chiclana felt encouraged when Saavedra resigned, and started to request signatures for a manifesto about the will of the people. Moreno refused any further involvement, but Castelli and Peña trusted that he would eventually join them if events unfolded as they expected.|$|E
