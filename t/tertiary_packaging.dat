The MCS profiles shed light on the subsurface of the region in particular on the Quaternary and Tertiary features. In the foreland basin province, the MCS profiles imaged an almost undeformed structural and stratigraphic frame with very thick Cretaceous to <b>Tertiary</b> <b>package.</b> Seismic evidence of deformation of the foreland units occurs in the fold-and-thrust belt province. Along the Cordillera province, the Magallanes-Fagnano transform fault exerts an important morpho-tectonic control that strongly conditions its bathymetric profile. The seismic profiles also highlighted a number of depositional features linked to the up to 150 m thick sedimentary record of the glacial cycles. Whereas the eastern segment (outer foreland province) is devoid of significant glacial-related deposits, the central segment (inner foreland and fold-and thrust belt provinces) shows evidence of repeated advances and retreats of the Magellan glacier. An important moraine ridge complex, probably corresponding to the glacial advance “D”of Clapperton et al., has been seismically imaged in the central segment, as well as an older, large bank of ice distal sediments that have been interpreted as proglacial lake deposits, which show evident signs of repeated glacial erosions. Ice-contact features in the form of frontal moraine complexes made up of dipping foreset strata are present in the fjord-like, western segment of the Strait (Cordillera province), along with their related ice-proximal and ice-distal facies. Eventually, the occurrence of preglacial sediments tectonized by the Magallanes-Fagnano transform fault has been reported in the same segment.

40|$|E 2016 : 096 Volvo Cars is a {{manufacturer}} of cars and currently there are approximately six million Volvo cars on the roads. To manage the distribution of spare parts for the cars, Volvo have implemented Local Distribution Centers (LDC’s) that handle the spare part distribution to dealers within a twohour radius driving distance. This distribution process requires packaging for the spare parts. The processes and procedures connected to packaging are not standardized and Volvo want to improve {{the control of the}} packaging flow. To get {{a better understanding of the}} packaging connected to the spare parts distribution, an investigation has been conducted that consists of mapping of the current state, examination of the packaging products that are used and a study of the costs and ordering connected to the packaging flow. The investigation has been made on a selected LDC in Maastricht. The mapping of the packaging flow showed that improvements regarding the information flow as well as the return flow can be made. If the information flow is improved regarding better and more standardized routines connected to updating the inventory, the control of the flow can be improved as well. If the return flow is improved and further utilized, more packaging products can be reused and the costs may decrease. The investigation of packaging types showed which secondary packaging was preferred by the operators and which types that were easiest to handle. This investigation showed that the blue boxes were seen as preferable, with comparison to the other secondary packaging types. Furthermore, the same process was made for the <b>tertiary</b> <b>packaging</b> as the secondary packaging. It was shown that the HD boxes are beneficial, with comparison to the One Way boxes.

40|$|Since {{very few}} {{products}} are truly lifecycle adapted, most products need supportive functions during part(s) of their lifecycle — ranging from extensive systems of primary, secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>packages</b> {{to a simple}} wrapping or chemical surface protection. When a package is needed, consideration is seldom given to it during the actual development of the product. See Bramklev (2004). An illustrative example {{of the consequences of}} not addressing the development of the product and its package in an integrated manner was provided by a company developing and manufacturing gasoline pumps and emanates from the late 1990 s when they started sell gasoline pumps to Eastern Europe. Since the company did not have any previous experiences of delivering pumps to these countries, they were unaware of the magnitude of loads and other environmental conditions facing the pumps during handling and transportation to the sites where they were to be installed. The result in terms of gasoline pumps that were severely damaged during the distribution phase demanded immediate actions from the company. The first reaction was to improve the “strength” of the pumps by redesigning those parts that were damaged. The redesigns solved the problem, but significantly increased the costs for the pumps. The lesson learned was that an improved, more effective and efficient bad carrying package provided a cheaper and easier way of solving the problem, thus also avoiding the problem of providing different pump solutions or, alternatively, over-dimensioned pumps to the majority of the customers. The action taken by the company was to enrol one of its engineering designers in a packaging design course, thereby creating the possibility to more efficiently and effectively handle this kind of problem in the future. The actual reduction in costs and lead time are not known, but the company claims that they were “significant”. This instance {{is just one of many}} similar cases emanating from the globalisation of the economy, and is an important concern for a successful development of global enterprises, as they are based on networks composed of divisions and supplier companies dispersed all over the world. In global enterprises the handling, transportation and storage of parts, sub-assemblies and final products creates an inner and an outer market, demanding in-time and error-free deliveries at lowest possible costs and with a minimal impact on the environment. In order to successfully fulfil these demands it is necessary to make sure that the Product-Package-System, the PPS for short, is developed as efficiently and effectively as possible. In a proposal aiming at facilitating the fulfilment of the demands for an efficient and effective development of the PPS, Bjärnemo et. al. (2000) suggested a development process for the integration of packaging logistics into the product development process. By adopting the proposed integration concept, it is possible for a multidisciplinary product and packaging development team to allocate essential functions between product and package, thus making it possible to fulfil the demands set out for a given PPS in a most effective and efficient way — something unattainable in the traditional, sequential, development of product and package. In three surveys performed within the mechanical, food and pharmaceutical industries, Bramklev (2004) verified the interest and expectations in industry for the proposed integration concept. In a second stage of this research project, the overall objective is to develop an industrially implementable process model for the integration of product and package development. The first obstacle to be confronted in striving to obtain this objective has been the lack of a suitable package development process model. Based on extensive studies in industry as well as on the literature on current package development processes, Bramklev (2007) has developed a package development process model adapted to facilitate the proposed integration concept. The objective set out for this article is to report the development of a first version of an integrated product and package development process model. Before undertaking this task it is important to establish the point of departure for the development efforts reported...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD (Soil Science)) [...] Univ ersity of Stellenbosch, 2008. The (semi-) arid Namaqualand {{region on}} the west coast of South Africa is wellknown for its spring flower displays. Due to the aridity of the region, soils {{research}} has lagged behind that of the more agriculturally productive parts of South Africa. However, rehabilitation efforts after the hundred or so years of mining, coupled with the increasing ecology and biodiversity research, have prompted a recent interest in Namaqualand soils as a substrate for plant growth. The area is also notable for the abundance of heuweltjies. Much of the previous heuweltjie-work focussed on biogenic aspects such as their spacing, origin and age, but although heuweltjies are in fact a soil feature, there have been few published studies on the soil forming processes within heuweltjies. However, the depositional history of the sediments on the Namaqualand coastal plain is well constrained, which is {{in stark contrast to the}} paucity of data on their subsequent pedogenesis. Given that the regolith has been subaerially exposed in some parts for much of the Neogene, the soil formation forms an important part of the sediments’ history. The primary aim of this thesis, therefore, was to examine the soil features of the Namaqualand coastal plain to further the understanding of pedogenesis in the region. The regolith of the northern Namaqualand coastal plain, often ten or more metres deep, comprises successive late <b>Tertiary</b> marine <b>packages,</b> each deposited during sea-level regression. The surface soil horizons formed from an aeolian parent material. The relatively low CaCO 3 in the aeolian sands dictated the pedogenic pathway in these deposits. The non-calcareous pathway lead to clay-rich, redder apedal horizons that show a stronger structure with depth, and generally rest directly on marine sands via a subtle discontinuity that suggests pedogenesis continues into the underlying marine facies. The calcareous pathway lead to similar clay-rich, redder apedal B horizons, but which differ in that they are calcareous, and rest on a calcrete horizon often via a stoneline of rounded pebbles. Deeper in the profile, there is generally a regular alteration of sedimentary units, with the upper shoreface facies showing reddening, and the lower shoreface sands remaining pale. This seems to be a function of the grain size, since the upper shoreface materials are coarser, and the redder parts of the lower shoreface are also associated with slightly coarser sands. In some strata the oxidation of glauconite-rich sediments resulted in an orange colour. In an area with abundant heuweltjies, a strongly-cemented calcretized nest was present about 2 m deep within a silica cemented, locally calcareous dorbank profile. Vertical termite burrows are present up to 12 m deep, and appear to have been conduits for preferential vertical flow. Soil formation and termite activity is at least as old as the Last Interglacial. E horizons may have formed in a wetter Last Interglacial paleoclimate, but they are still active in the present day. The Namaqualand coastal plain, with its extensive areas of calcrete development, is almost a textbook setting for calcrete development by inorganic processes. However, these calcretes also show microscale biogenic features. These include M rods, MA rods, and fungal filaments. Abiotic alpha-fabric seems dominant in mature calcrete horizons, and beta-fabric in calcareous nodules in a calcic B horizon above calcrete. The apparent absence of Mg-calcite and dolomite, and abundance of sepiolite in the calcretes of coastal Namaqualand suggests that these Mg-rich clay minerals are the main Mg-bearing phase. Deformation (pseudo-anticlines) in the calcrete appear to result primarily from the displacive effect of calcite crystallization. Although evidence of shrink/swell behaviour is present in the form of accommodating planes, it does not appear to be as volumetrically significant as displacive calcite. Indurated light-coloured horizons that resembled calcrete but are non- to mildly calcareous, break with a conchoidal fracture, resist slaking in both acid and alkali, turn methyl-orange purple, and show a bulk-soil sepiolite XRD peak are similar to palygorskite-cemented material (‘palycrete’) from Spain and Portugal, and so were tentatively named ‘sepiocrete’. Sepiolite and palygorskite are often reported from arid region soils but there has been no recorded cementation of soils by sepiolite. The degree of induration in some of these horizons suggest that amorphous silica could play a role in cementation, and so this thesis compares the two silica-cemented horizons encountered in Namaqualand (silcrete and dorbank (petroduric)) to these ‘sepiocrete’ horizons. Both silica and sepiolite are present in the matrix, although the degree to which silica and sepiolite dominate seems to vary even within same horizon. It seems most probable that both contribute to the structural properties of the horizon. Sepiolitic horizons do not form a diagnostic horizon in the World Reference Base, Soil Taxonomy, or the South African system. To fit the existing soil classification schemes, the terms ‘sepiolitic’ and ‘petrosepiolitic’ (in the same sense as ‘calcic’ and ‘petrocalcic’) would be appropriate. The term ‘sepiolitic’ should be used for horizons which: contain sepiolite in amounts great enough for it to be detected by XRD in the bulk soil, peds (a fractured surface and not just the cutan) cling strongly to the wetted tongue, and methyl orange turns from orange to purple-pink over most of a fragmented surface. The term can be easily be applied as a adjective to other hardpans where sepiolite is significant but not necessarily cementing, such as ‘sepiolitic’ petrocalcic/petroduric. If the horizon is in addition to the above criteria cemented to such a degree that it will slake neither in acid (so cannot be classified as petrocalcic) nor in alkali (and so cannot be classified as petroduric) then the term ‘petrosepiolitic’ would be appropriate. The ‘sepiolitic’ criteria distinguish the ‘petrosepiolitic’ horizon from a ‘silcrete’, a silica-cemented horizon which does not fit the definition of petroduric. Sepiolite is more prominent than palygorskite in the XRD traces. The HCO− 3 initially, which results in an increasing Mg trend with evaporation during the precipitation of sepiolite according to the Hardie-Eugster scheme. The result is that after sepiolite precipitation is initiated by a geochemical pH-barrier, Mg levels will rise causing the increasing (Mg+Si) /Al ratio to continue to favour sepiolite precipitation. This suggests that once sepiolite has begun to precipitate, the subsequent salinity with its accompanying Mg increase makes substantial palygorskite formation unlikely to follow. The hardpan horizons in heuweltjies commonly grade from a ‘sepiolitic’ petrocalcic in the centre through ‘sepiolitic’/‘petrosepiolitic’ to the petroduric horizon on the edges. Noteworthy sepiolite-related pedofeatures in the calcrete include ‘ooids’ with successive sepiolite (hydrophilic and therefore a precipitational substrate) and micrite/acicular calcite layers in the coatings; and limpid yellow nodules with pseudo-negative uniaxial interference figures. They superficially resemble the spherulites in the fresh termite frass. Their fibrous nature and low birefringence, together with the low Ca, high Mg, Si composition, and molar Mg/Si ratios consistent with sepiolite. The pedogenesis of the hardpans in the heuweltjie is proposed to be as follows: enrichment of cations such as Ca and Mg in the heuweltjie centre caused by termite foraging results in calcite and clay authigenesis in the centre of the heuweltjie, leaving the precipitation of pure silica to occur on the periphery. The decaying organic matter concentrated in the centre of the mound by the termites is sufficient to supply the components for calcite precipitation in the centre of the heuweltjie. Following calcite precipitation, the pH is suitable for sepiolite precipitation. The movement of the Mg-Si enriched water downslope, coupled with the decrease in HCO− 3 and increase in Mg 2 + due to sepiolite precipitation, allows for the precipitation of the ‘sepiolitic’ zone on the outer side of the calcrete, and extend beyond the calcrete in some heuweltjies. The Namaqualand coastal plain is well positioned for further work on its regolith, particularly because of the mining excavations which provide excellent exposures of well-defined layers of the regolith down to bedrock. Soil formation and termite activity is at least as old as the Last Interglacial, and so more detailed work would further the understanding of the subaerial alteration history in southern Africa, as well as providing better-constrained information on the Namaqualand soils that can be used by land-use management and biosphere studies...|$|R
40|$|This report {{focuses on}} {{packaging}} opportunities {{that may help}} to reduce or recover food waste, proposes opportunities for industry to address food waste through innovative and sustainable primary, secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>packaging.</b> Food security is an emerging challenge for policy makers and companies in the food supply chain. The global population {{is expected to grow}} to 9 billion and demand for food by 77 % by 2050. Over the same period food production will be under threat from climate change, competing land uses, erosion and diminishing supplies of clean water. One of the solutions to this dilemma is increased efficiency and waste reduction in the food supply chain. This report focuses on packaging opportunities that may help to reduce or recover food waste. Packaging has a vital role to play in containing and protecting food as it moves through the supply chain to the consumer. It already reduces food waste in transport and storage, and innovations in packaging materials, design and labelling provide new opportunities to improve efficiencies. Product protection needs to be the primary goal for packaging sustainability, and sometimes this requires trade-offs between packaging and food waste. The report draws on an international literature review and interviews with representatives from 15 organisations in the Australian food and packaging supply chain. It considers food waste along the entire food supply chain, but with a particular emphasis on food waste that occurs prior to consumption, i. e. during agriculture production, post-harvest handling and storage of raw materials, and in the commercial and industrial (C&I) sector consisting of food manufacturing, wholesale trade, food retail and distribution and food services. Food rescue through charities is also a focus of the report. Over 4. 2 million tonnes of food waste is disposed to landfill in Australia each year. Around 1. 5 million tonnes of this is from the commercial and industrial sector (the focus of this report), costing around $ 10. 5 billion in waste disposal charges and lost product. The largest single contributor in the commercial and industrial sector is food service activities (e. g., cafes, restaurants, fast food outlets), which generate 661, 000 tonnes of food waste per year, followed by food manufacturing (312, 000 tonnes) and food retail (179, 000 tonnes). Most waste in food manufacturing is unavoidable, and almost 90 % is already recovered as animal feed, compost or energy...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Chemistry in the Faculty of Applied Sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyPaperboard made from recycled fibres is being used more frequently in direct food packaging applications, {{in addition to its}} use as secondary and <b>tertiary</b> <b>packaging.</b> However, recent research has shown that there is a risk that harmful chemicals may migrate from the paperboard into the food. The simplest approach to reducing the migration of these contaminants is the use of barrier films. The barrier efficiencies of these various films can be examined by means of a migration test into a food simulant, followed by extraction in a suitable solvent. The extract can then be analysed by chromatographic techniques such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine the concentration of the specific contaminants. However on a production level, the availability of this type of highly specialised equipment is limited. A simple, cost effective method is needed to evaluate the barrier properties to specific chemical contaminants. The Heptane Vapour Transmission Rate (HVTR) test is a permeation test method for use at quality control level to determine barrier properties to the migration of organic vapours. The first part of the study focussed on establishing a universal correlation between HVTR and specific migration of diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) that would be applicable to any type of functional barrier. However, experimental data demonstrated this was not possible as the correlation factor linking HVTR to specific migration was largely dependent on the type and morphology of the coating considered. The initial objective of the study was reconsidered in favour of building individual models specific {{to the nature of the}} coating and substrate considered. A correlation between HVTR and specific migration of DiBP, DBP and DEHP for a polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) barrier polymer was constructed by varying the applied coating weight. The vapour transport mechanism for the HVTR test and the specific migration test were found to differ, showing that a direct correlation between HVTR and the specific migration was again not possible. However, an indirect correlation could be made. The HVTR method gives an indication of film integrity, whereas the coating weight could be used as an indicator of the specific migration. The correlation between the coating weight and the specific migration yielded an equation that can be used to calculate the specific migration through the PVDC barrier polymer, provided the quantity of the chemical contaminant originally present in the paperboard was known. This equation was specific to the type of barrier polymer, the specific chemical contaminant as well as the intended shelf-life of the food product to be packaged in the paperboard...|$|E
