5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel <b>tank</b> <b>filler.</b> A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second odometer, also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E
25|$|In Europe and Australia, the {{customer}} selects {{one of several}} color-coded nozzles {{depending on the type}} of fuel required. The filler pipe of unleaded fuel is smaller than the one for fuels for engines designed to take leaded fuel. The <b>tank</b> <b>filler</b> opening has a corresponding diameter; this prevents inadvertently using leaded fuel in an engine not designed for it, which can damage a catalytic converter. In European Union countries leaded fuel is no longer available, with LRP (lead replacement petrol) being the only fuel available for engines which need it.|$|E

Jenkinson's {{spectacles}} were blown off by the slipstream when he vomited {{over the side of}} the Mercedes; he carried a replacement pair. Arriving in Rome, he and Moss were told they were leading from Taruffi, Herrmann, Kling and Fangio, but from then on they had no way of knowing whether any of their rivals had gone ahead on elapsed time. Soon after Rome, Kling's race ended when he went off the road avoiding spectators and crashed into a tree.|$|E

500|$|Though Ford {{could have}} {{proceeded}} with the formal recall hearing, fearing additional {{damage to the}} company's public reputation the company agreed to a [...] "voluntary recall" [...] program. On June 9, 1978, days before the NHTSA was to issue Ford a formal recall order, Ford recalled 1.5 million Ford Pintos and Mercury Bobcats, the largest recall in automotive history at the time. Ford disagreed with the NHTSA finding of defect, and said the recall was to [...] "end public concern that has resulted from criticism of the fuel systems in these vehicles." [...] The Ford recall place polyethylene shield between the tank and likely causes of puncture, lengthened the filler tube, and improved <b>tank</b> <b>filler</b> seal {{in the event of}} collision ...|$|E

[...] Air at 90 psi powered the pneumatic servo-motors for the elevators and rudder.|$|E
50|$|In {{installations}} {{where more}} than one tank is fitted, T-fittings {{may be used to}} connect the <b>tanks</b> to one <b>filler</b> so that the tanks are filled simultaneously. In some applications, more than one filler may be fitted, such as {{on opposite sides of the}} vehicle. These may be connected to separate tanks, or may be connected to the same tanks using T-fittings in the same manner as for connecting multiple <b>tanks</b> to one <b>filler.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a {{prosecution}} {{brought by the}} Environment Agency in 2002, Total Fina Elf UK Ltd was fined a total of £54,000 for causing petrol to enter groundwater and {{a tributary of the}} Foudry Brook, from its service station in Tadley, Hampshire. Between January 1999 and March 2001 the petrol station lost between 2,000 and 10,000 litres of fuel into the ground following leaks in an underground petrol <b>tank,</b> and <b>filler</b> and suction lines.|$|R
5000|$|The later Mk IIs and {{approximately}} the first 4,000 Mk IIIs had a later type of [...] "beetle back" [...] {{with an additional}} small window on the left front side and windows in both doors.

50|$|The Rear Drive B-body was {{the last}} {{platform}} design to have the gasoline <b>tank</b> <b>filler</b> port behind the license plate. Exceptions included all station wagons, {{as well as all}} 1961-64 cars - which had the <b>tank</b> <b>filler</b> in the rear fender on the driver's side and 1965 Buicks which had their fuel filler door above the license plate. Also, the Pontiac B-Body vehicles from 1941 till 1948 had the fuel filler door in the rear fender on the driver's side. Very likely this would also have been the case with the B-Body Oldsmobile and Buick.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{interest}} of both engine longevity as well as creating some extra space under the hood, a [...] "dry sump" [...] engine lubrication system was used. Originally developed for use in race cars {{as a way to}} prevent foaming of the engine oil by the crankshaft which in turn would create a serious drop in oil pressure, the system circulated twelve litres of oil between the storage tank mounted inside the right front fender and the engine as opposed to the usual four or five litres found in V8s with a standard oil pan and oil pump. As a result, the engine itself had no dipstick for checking the oil level. Rather, the dipstick was attached {{to the inside of the}} <b>tank's</b> <b>filler</b> cap (accessible from the engine compartment) and the oil level was checked with the engine running and at operating temperature. The dry sump system also had the benefit of extending the oil change interval to 12,500 miles (20,000 km). This, along with hydraulic valve lifters which required no adjusting and special cylinder head gaskets which eliminated the need for periodic retorquing of the head bolts, made the 6.9 nearly maintenance-free for its first 50,000 miles (80,500 km). The 6.9 required little basic service other than coolant, minor tune-ups, oil changes and replacement of the air, fuel, oil and power-steering-fluid filters.|$|R
5000|$|Four-wheel {{disc brakes}} and four-wheel {{independent}} suspension were standard on these top-of-the-line models. The M100 engine is a cast iron V8 with single overhead camshafts {{which was a}} bigger version of the engine also used in the Mercedes-Benz 600 and the Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3. Notable is the Bosch K-Jetronic electromechanical fuel injection, forged crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons, and a [...] "dry sump" [...] engine lubrication system. As a result, the engine itself had no dipstick for checking the oil level. Rather, the dipstick {{was attached to the}} inside of the <b>tank's</b> <b>filler</b> cap (accessible from the engine compartment) and the oil level was checked with the engine running and at operating temperature. The non-American market trim version of the 6.9 l (6,834 cc or 417 in³) power plant was rated at [...] and 405 lb·ft (549 N·m) of torque, helping to compensate for the 2.65 to 1 final drive ratio necessary for sustained high-speed cruising. The dry sump system also had the benefit of extending the oil change interval to 12,500 miles (20,000 km). This, along with hydraulic valve lifters which required no adjusting and special cylinder head gaskets which eliminated the need for periodic retorquing of the head bolts, made the 6.9 relatively easy to maintain and service for its first 50,000 miles (80,500 km). The 6.9 required little basic service other than coolant, minor tune-ups, oil changes, and replacement of the air, fuel, oil and power steering filters.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a cast iron V8 with single {{overhead}} camshafts operating sodium-filled valves against hardened valve seats on each aluminium alloy cylinder head. Each hand-built unit was bench-tested for 265 minutes, 40 {{of which were}} under full load. Bosch K-Jetronic electromechanical fuel injection was standard {{at a time when}} fuel-injected cars were uncommon. As in all Mercedes-Benz automobile engines, the crankshaft, connecting rods and pistons were forged instead of cast. The 6.9 l (6834 cc or 417 in³) power plant was factory-rated at 286 hp (213 kW) with 405 lb·ft (549 N·m) of torque helping to compensate for the 2.65 to 1 final drive ratio necessary for sustained high-speed cruising. A special version for Australia, based on the North American version, however without catalyst, was rated at 269 hp (198 kW) with 51 kpm (510 N·m) of torque. In the interest of both engine longevity as well as creating some extra space under the hood, a [...] "dry sump" [...] engine lubrication system was used. The system circulated twelve quarts of oil between the storage tank and the engine, as opposed to the usual four or five quarts found in V8s with a standard oil pan and oil pump.

40|$|A {{combined}} {{engineering and}} geochemistry approach {{is recommended for}} the stabilization of waste in decommissioned tanks and contaminated soils at the AX Tank Farm, Hanford, WA. A two-part strategy of desiccation and gettering is proposed for treatment of the in-tank residual wastes. Dry portland cement and/or fly ash are suggested as an effective and low-cost desiccant for wicking excess moisture from the upper waste layer. Getters work by either ion exchange or phase precipitation to reduce radionuclide concentrations in solution. The authors recommend the use of specific natural and man-made compounds, appropriately proportioned to the unique inventory of each <b>tank.</b> A <b>filler</b> design consisting of multilayered cementitous grout with interlayered sealant horizons should serve to maintain tank integrity and minimize fluid transport to the residual waste form. External tank soil contamination is best mitigated by placement of grouted skirts under and around each tank, together with installation of a cone-shaped permeable reactive barrier beneath the entire tank farm. Actinide release rates are calculated from four tank closure scenarios ranging from no action to a comprehensive stabilization treatment plan (desiccant/getters/grouting/RCRA cap). Although preliminary, these calculations indicate significant reductions in the potential for actinide transport {{as compared to the}} no-treatment option...|$|R
5000|$|In mid-1972, the E38 {{option was}} {{superseded}} {{by the more}} powerful and greatly refined four-speed transmission E49 option.

It would take a Ferrari Daytona with racing driver Jackie Ickx at the wheel to stay with one". All E49s came with a Track Pack, 21 of which featured the huge fuel <b>tank</b> with dual <b>fillers.</b> The E49 six pack engine came with a baffled sump, tuned length headers, special shot-peened crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, rings, cam, valve springs, a twin plate clutch {{and of course the}} triple 45 mm dual throat Weber carburetors.

5000|$|For 1936, at the 29th Paris Motor Show, in October 1935, various {{modifications}} were on show. [...] At {{the front}} painted front grilles replaced chrome ones and the headlight covers were restyled.

40|$|The cyclic {{operation}} of molten-salt {{thermal energy storage}} thermoclines for solar thermal power plants is systematically investigated. A comprehensive, two-temperature model is first developed for the cyclic {{operation of}} a thermocline operating with a commercially available molten salt as the heat transfer fluid and quartzite rock as the filler. Volume-averaged mass and momentum equations are employed, with the Brinkman–Forchheimer extension to the Darcy law used to model the porous-medium resistance.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study, a quantitative microbial exposure assessment (QMEA) model applied to an aseptic-UHT food process was developed [Pujol, L., Albert, I., Magras, C., Johnson, N. B., Membré, J. M. Probabilistic exposure assessment model to estimate aseptic UHT product failure rate. 2015 International Journal of Food Microbiology. 192, 124 – 141]. It quantified Sterility Failure Rate (SFR) associated with Bacillus cereus and Geobacillus stearothermophilus per process module (nine modules in total from raw material reception to end-product storage). Previously, the probabilistic model inputs were set by experts (using knowledge and in-house data). However, only the variability dimension {{was taken into}} account. The model was then improved using expert elicitation knowledge in two ways. First, the model was refined by adding the uncertainty dimension to the probabilistic inputs, enabling to set a second order Monte Carlo analysis. The eight following inputs, {{and their impact on}} SFR, are presented in detail in this present study: D-value for each bacteria of interest (B. cereus and G. stearothermophilus) associated with the inactivation model for the UHT treatment step, i. e., two inputs; log reduction (decimal reduction) number associated with the inactivation model for the packaging sterilization step for each bacterium and each part of the packaging (product container and sealing component), i. e., four inputs; and bacterial spore air load of the aseptic <b>tank</b> and the <b>filler</b> cabinet rooms, i. e., two inputs. Second, the model was improved by leveraging expert knowledge to develop further the existing model. The proportion of bacteria in the product which settled on surface of pipes (between the UHT treatment and the aseptic tank on one hand, and between the aseptic <b>tank</b> and the <b>filler</b> cabinet on the other hand) leading to a possible biofilm formation for each bacterium, was better characterized. It was modeled {{as a function of the}} hygienic design level of the aseptic-UHT line: the experts provided the model structure and most of the model parameters values. Mean of SFR was estimated to 10 × 10 − 8 (95 % Confidence Interval = [0 × 10 − 8; 350 × 10 − 8]) and 570 × 10 − 8 (95 % CI = [380 × 10 − 8; 820 × 10 − 8]) for B. cereus and G. stearothermophilus, respectively. These estimations were more accurate (since the confidence interval was provided) than those given by the model with only variability (for which the estimates were 15 × 10 − 8 and 580 × 10 − 8 for B. cereus and G. stearothermophilus, respectively). The updated model outputs were also compared with those obtained when inputs were described by a generic distribution, without specific information related to the case-study. Results showed that using a generic distribution can lead to unrealistic estimations (e. g., 3, 181, 000 product units contaminated by G. stearothermophilus among 108 product units produced) and emphasized the added value of eliciting information from experts from the relevant specialist field knowledge...|$|R
