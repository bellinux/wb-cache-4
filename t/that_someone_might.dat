5|$|To date, the {{excavation}} project at Fort Tanjong Katong has ended {{and only the}} south-eastern bastion, which was nearly fully excavated, has been cordoned off indefinitely (the south-western bastion was left untouched). Except for the cordoned off bastion, other exposed fort remains were reburied again in December 2005 by the National Parks Board, which runs the park, to protect them against the elements for future archaeologists to discover. It was also done because the dug-out pits could well breed mosquitoes; there were also fears <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>might</b> {{fall into one of}} the 2 m-deep holes. The remaining funds, about S$150,000, were ploughed back into bursaries and scholarships for the constituency's students.|$|E

He cannot reach her hand but her long hair tumbles down {{from the window and}} he kisses and caresses it instead. Pelléas playfully ties Mélisande's hair to a willow tree in spite of her protests <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>might</b> see them. A flock of doves takes flight. Mélisande panics when she hears Golaud's {{footsteps}} approaching. Golaud dismisses Pelléas and Mélisande as nothing but a pair of children and leads Pelléas away.|$|E

25|$|May {{asserted}} that in Paris, London and other capitals, {{there was an}} inability to believe <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>might</b> want another world war. He wrote that, given public reluctance to contemplate another war and a need to reach consensus about Germany, the rulers of France and Britain were reticent (to take a stand against German aggression), which limited dissent {{at the cost of}} enabling assumptions that suited their convenience. In France, Édouard Daladier withheld information until the last moment, and then presented the Munich Agreement to the French cabinet as a fait accompli in September 1938, thus avoiding discussions over whether Britain would follow France into war or if the military balance was really in Germany's favour or how significant it was. The decision for war in September 1939 and the plan devised in the winter of 1939–1940 by Daladier for war with the USSR followed the same pattern.|$|E
25|$|Episodes 9–12: A human cost. Happy has {{a sudden}} angina attack, and while in an outer {{suburban}} hospital befriends intern Dr Liz Gibson (Lisa McCune). The next day, Gibson becomes {{the subject of}} a medical negligence writ. Concerned that her boss, Meg Morrison (Louise Siversen), and her nemesis, nurse Chloe Davis (Jacinta Stapleton) are teaming up against her, Liz seeks Happy's assistance. Even though both Amanda and Liz herself have doubts about her competence, Happy stands by her. However, when Jamie and Layla discover just how understaffed and incompetently run Prospect Valley Hospital is, they realise <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>might</b> be making Liz a scapegoat to cover up greater crimes. Elsewhere, Amanda goes up against a Health Review Board manager, David Simpson (Erik Thomson) in court, only to find herself in a passionate relationship with him outside of work. But when she learns that he may be behind the plot to convict Liz, Amanda is put into a devastating conflict of interest. Things come to a head when Liz and her boyfriend - fellow intern Dr Tim Whitney (Paul Bishop) - must both be protected against the schemes at the hospital, and as Happy fights with Amanda over the case, his health takes a serious turn for the worse.|$|E

Hindley admitted that her attitude towards the child was [...] "brusque and cruel", but claimed that was only because she was afraid <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>might</b> hear Downey screaming. Hindley claimed that when Downey was being undressed she herself was [...] "downstairs"; when the pornographic photographs were taken she was [...] "looking out the window"; and that when the child was being strangled she [...] "was running a bath".|$|E

50|$|The {{idea about}} {{immediate}} notice (or {{the lack of}} it) was not originally Muggleton's. It was first written about by Laurence Clarkson.

500|$|The wind, tide and sea made it {{impossible}} for the Liverpool lifeboat to link up with the waiting tug for another tow, so the men were forced to start rowing home. [...] About twenty minutes later, as the boat reached the safer waters of the channel, the master elected to raise the foresail to help steady the vessel. [...] People in the lifeboat were still congratulating themselves on their lucky escape, when Captain Martin noticed a huge wave [...] "like a high wall" [...] approaching. He instructed everyone to hold on, fearing <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>might</b> be washed overboard. [...] However rather than breaking over the boat, the wave lifted it and flipped it over. The boat was not self-righting, so the remaining survivors were left clinging desperately to the upturned boat. Rattlers master witnessed the incident, signaled to the New Brighton lifeboat, Willie and Arthur, which promptly turned around to come to the rescue. The men who were on the capsized boat directed the New Brighton lifeboat to first assist three others who were in more danger clinging to bits of wood in the sea. After picking up the survivors and one casualty, the New Brighton lifeboat was taken in tow by Rattler, which brought her back to New Brighton. [...] Six of Ellen Southards crew, the captain and his wife, as well as the pilot and three lifeboat men from Mersey Docks drowned or died of exposure (12 fatalities in total).|$|E

25|$|By contrast, {{other major}} currencies, {{such as the}} pound {{sterling}} and euro, feature notes of differing sizes: {{the size of the}} note increases with the denomination and different denominations are printed in different, contrasting colors.

After {{viewing the}} Patterson–Gimlin film with John Green, costume {{designer}} and ape-suit mime Janos Prohaska (noted {{for his work}} in the late-1960s television programs Star Trek and Lost in Space) concluded the film's subject looked real to him. When asked if he thought the film was faked, Prohaska replied, [...] "I don't think so ... to me it looks very, very real." [...] If the film was hoaxed, Prohaska thought, it was remarkably realistic and sophisticated, and the best costume he had ever seen, and the only plausible explanation was <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>might</b> have glued false hair [...] "directly to the actor's skin".|$|E
2500|$|Indulgences were {{intended}} to offer remission of the temporal punishment due to sin equivalent to <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>might</b> obtain by performing a canonical penance for a specific period of time. As Purgatory became more prominent in Christian thinking, the idea developed that the term of indulgences related to remission of time in Purgatory. Indeed, many Late Medieval indulgences were for terms well over a human lifetime, reflecting this belief. [...] For several centuries it was debated by theologians whether penance or purgatory was the currency of the indulgences granted, and the church did not settle the matter definitively, for example avoiding doing so at the Council of Trent. [...] The modern view {{of the church is}} that the term is penance.|$|E
2500|$|As {{to those}} who refuse to be oedipalized {{in one form or}} another, at one end or the other in the treatment, the {{psychoanalyst}} is there to call the asylum or the police for help. The police on our side!—never did psychoanalysis better display its taste for supporting the movement of social repression, and for participating in it with enthusiasm. [...] notice of the dominant tone in the most respected associations: [...] consider Dr. Mendel and the Drs Stéphane, the state of fury that is theirs, and their literally police-like appeal at the thought <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>might</b> try to escape the Oedipal dragnet. Oedipus {{is one of those things}} that becomes all the more dangerous the less people believe in it; then the cops are there to replace the high priests.|$|E

2500|$|On 20 September 2016, BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight aired a {{programme}} {{in which}} a British spy (known only as [...] "Martin") who had infiltrated the IRA claimed that Murphy and other leading South Armagh Republicans had demanded the killing of Donaldson {{and that it would}} have been sanctioned by Gerry Adams. The agent claimed [...] "I know from my experience in the IRA that murders have to be approved by the leadership," [...] When he was asked specifically who he was referring to, he went on: [...] "Gerry Adams, he gives the final say." [...] 'Martin' also dismissed claims the Real IRA was responsible for Donaldson's killing, he said they made the claim [...] "for the kudos, a forlorn hope <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>might</b> take them more seriously these days".|$|E
2500|$|Paul {{does not}} believe the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks were a {{government}} conspiracy and has explicitly denied being a 9/11 [...] "truther", arguing {{that the issue is}} not a conspiracy but a failure of bureaucracy.

But, it wasn't something that was deliberately done." [...] He does not think the government would have staged such an attack. When asked whether [...] "9/11 was orchestrated by the government", Paul responded, [...] "Absolutely not." [...] Paul has stated that he is concerned <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>might</b> create a [...] "contrived Gulf of Tonkin-type incident" [...] to justify the invasion of Iran or suspend the democratic process, adding, [...] "Let's hope I'm wrong about this one." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Second World War, {{it became}} clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet {{literature}} was not something which most major publishing houses would touch—including his regular publisher Gollancz. He also submitted the manuscript to Faber and Faber, where the poet T. S. Eliot (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book's [...] "good writing" [...] and [...] "fundamental integrity", but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint [...] "which I take to be generally Trotskyite". Eliot said he found the view [...] "not convincing", and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>might</b> argue [...] "what was needed... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs". Orwell let André Deutsch, who was working for Nicholson & Watson in 1944, read the typescript, and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson & Watson would want to publish it; however, they did not, and [...] "lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in Animal Farm." [...] In his London Letter on 17 April 1944 for Partisan Review, Orwell wrote that it was [...] "now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-Russian printed. Anti-Russian books do appear, but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle." ...|$|E

25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that an intelligent species beyond a certain point of technological capability will destroy other intelligent species as they appear. The idea <b>that</b> something, or <b>someone,</b> <b>might</b> be destroying intelligent life in the universe has been explored in the scientific literature. A species might undertake such extermination out of expansionist motives, paranoia, or aggression. In 1981, cosmologist Edward Harrison argued that such behavior would {{be an act of}} prudence: an intelligent species that has overcome its own self-destructive tendencies might view any other species bent on galactic expansion as a threat. It has also been suggested that a successful alien species would be a superpredator, as are humans.|$|R
60|$|Vincent {{heard no}} more, {{but it was}} enough to show him that a sharp hunt was being kept up for him; and {{although}} he had no fear of being caught in the woods, he was well pleased at the thought that he would soon be across the water and beyond the reach of his enemy. He went back again {{to the edge of the}} clearing and resumed his watch. It was just getting dusk, and he was about to join Dan when he saw a party of twelve men ride out from the other side of the wood and make toward the house. Filled with a vague alarm <b>that</b> possibly <b>someone</b> <b>might</b> have caught sight of him and his follower on the previous day, and might, on being questioned by the searchers, have given them a clew as to the direction in which they were going, Vincent hurried to the spot where he left Dan.

2500|$|The trial resumed on Monday, October 16 {{with the}} playing of the {{recorded}} {{negotiations between the}} FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit and Saldívar. The tape began with Saldívar stating how badly she wanted to die. During the conversation, the jury heard Larry Young try to persuade her to lower her gun; Saldívar said {{that she could not}} do so. Young told her that by committing suicide she would only harm her parents. Saldívar then asked to contact her mother to say goodbye and ask for forgiveness. She continued to whine [...] "I just wanna die" [...] as Young began talking about religion to determine if she believed in a faith that might cause her to reconsider suicide. Young told Saldívar that if she would give herself up, he would place a jacket over her so that the media would not have a picture of her face during her surrender. Isaac Valencia told Saldívar that if she were to surrender they promised to turn off all of the lights that were pointing towards her truck; she agreed. As she left her truck, she was scared by the dozens of armed police and FBI agents who were pointing rifles and pistols at her. She ran back to her truck, pointed the gun at her head, and screamed at Young: [...] "They're carrying guns! They're carrying guns! They're going to kill me! They're going to kill me!" [...] Anchor newswoman, María Celeste Arrarás, wrote in her 1997 investigative book, that she found it [...] "curious" [...] for a person who cried for hours that she wanted to die: [...] "would be afraid <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>might</b> make her wish come true."

50|$|Robert Roberts, {{as early}} as 1858, {{attempted}} to start a manuscript magazine - just a single copy sent from friend to friend through the post. It did not get beyond the 4th or 5th number. In 1862 John Thomas, having suspended publication of the Herald of the Kingdom, advised Roberts to start a magazine. It {{is at this point}} that Robert's re-baptism (mentioned above) occurred, midway between the first edition of 12 lectures (1861), and preceding in July 1864 commencement of the publication of The Ambassador of the Coming Age. Thomas, out of concern <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> else <b>might</b> start a publication and call it The Christadelphian, urged Robert Roberts to change the name of his magazine to The Christadelphian, which he did in 1869. His editorship of the magazine continued with some assistance until his death in 1898. Roberts collected for the Rosh Pinna settlement in Israel in 1886 and later, but lost significant funds in the failure of the American Electric Sugar Refining Company in 1888.|$|R
5000|$|Romero {{said that}} the remake came about {{in part because of}} issues over profits of the {{original}} film. A lengthy court battle over the rights to the film, plus an oversight that caused the copyright notice not to be included, caused Romero to see {{little in the way of}} profit. Romero's production company, Image 10, eventually won the lawsuit, but the distributor went out of business before they could collect any money. Another issue was the fact that the filmmakers were worried <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> else <b>might</b> make an unauthorized remake. Romero contacted Menahem Golan when he heard that 21st Century Film Corporation was interested in a remake, and Romero, Russo, and Steiner collaborated for the first time in twenty years. [...] Savini was initially hired to perform the special effects but was persuaded to direct by Romero. Savini was drawn to the remake because he was unavailable to do special effects on the original.|$|R
