25|$|The 2016-17 Colts roster {{would look}} much {{different}} from the one the previous year. One hundred point scorers Kevin Labanc and Andrew Magiapane had moved on to their respective AHL and NHL clubs. Mackenzie Blackwood would not return in goal. Also not returning was defensemen Michael Webster, Rasmus Andersson and Greg DiTomasso, and forwards Justin Scott, Keigan Goetz, Dylan Sadoway, and Julius Nattinen. The youth movement was on, as signaled by the blockbuster trade made preseason where the Colts sent a package including 10 draft picks to the Mississauga Steelheads in exchange for 16-year old Russian Kirill Niznikov. The Colts season would be a <b>tough</b> <b>one,</b> having them spend the majority {{of the year in the}} basement of the league. Come trade deadline the Colts were active, trading captain Cordell James to the Owen Sound Attack, Cameron Lizotte to the Erie Otters, and Barrie native Matt Brassard to the Oshawa Generals while acquiring Robert Proner and Jason Smith from the Saginaw Spirit and Mississauga Steelheads. The Colts would finish off the year with the youngest roster in the OHL and finishing last place overall in the league. A number one overall draft pick was in their future.|$|E

And sometimes it's … I mean, I can understand where he's coming from, but I don't always agree with it. I haven't endorsed anybody. I haven't talked to Trump. I haven't talked to anybody. You know, he's a racist now because he's talked about this judge. And yeah, it's a dumb thing to say.

When asked which candidate he would prefer between Trump and Hillary Clinton, Eastwood replied, [...] "That's a <b>tough</b> <b>one,</b> isn't it? I'd have to go for Trump … you know, 'cause she's declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle.
