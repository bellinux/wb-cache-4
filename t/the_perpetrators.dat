Oregon Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer was also involved in investigations of the group, working alongside Turner.|$|E

5|$|On 17 March 1924 Bormann {{was sentenced}} {{to a year in}} Elisabethstrasse Prison as an {{accomplice}} to his friend Rudolf Höss in the murder of Walther Kadow. <b>The</b> <b>perpetrators</b> believed Kadow had tipped off the French occupation authorities in the Ruhr District that fellow Freikorps member Albert Leo Schlageter was carrying out sabotage operations against French industries. Schlageter was arrested and was executed on 23 May 1923. On the night of 31 May, Höss, Bormann and several others took Kadow into a meadow out of town, where he was beaten and his throat cut. After one of <b>the</b> <b>perpetrators</b> confessed, police dug up the body and laid charges in July. Bormann was released from prison in February 1925.

40|$|Social-cognitive {{research}} has shown that people often make biased judgments about various behaviours. This study examined biases in situations of moral transgression. One hundred and twenty participants recalled one of four types of transgression: transgressions they committed against others, transgressions others committed against them, transgressions they observed others committing against others, and transgressions they committed against themselves. Participants made a variety of judgments about <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> 2 ̆ 7 s causal and moral responsibility for these transgressions. Participants then responded to Kohlberg 2 ̆ 7 s test of moral development. As expected, perpetrators consistently minimized their culpability for the transgressions they committed. Contrary to prediction, however, those describing their victimizations (by self and other) did not consistently maximize the culpability of <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> forthe transgressions committed against them. Observers who identified with the victim tended to respond as victims by maximizing the culpability of <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator.</b> Victims who identified with <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> tended to make moderate judgments of <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> 2 ̆ 7 s culpability. After identification was considered, both perpetrators and victims made self-exculpating judgments. Overall, participants who scored relatively high on Kohlberg 2 ̆ 7 s test tended to judge <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> to be more causally and morally responsible than participants who scored relatively low on Kohlberg 2 ̆ 7 s test. Higher scoring participants who responded from <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> 2 ̆ 7 s perspective tended to hold <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> (themselves or those whom they identified with) more culpable than lower scoring participants who responded from <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> 2 ̆ 7 s perspective.

40|$|AbstractBoth real-life {{events and}} {{research}} show that rape victims are sometimes blamed for their victimization. <b>The</b> effect of <b>perpetrator</b> characteristics on victim blaming {{has rarely been}} studied. In an experiment using a community sample (N = 161), we investigated the effect of <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator's</b> previous conviction and age, as well as participants’ gender and belief in a just world (BJW) on blame attributions using a vignette methodology. It was predicted that less victim blame and more perpetrator blame would be attributed when <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> had a previous conviction. Results showed that level of BJW was associated with victim blame (positively) and perpetrator blame (negatively). Men blamed the victim more and women blamed the victim less when <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> had a previous conviction. Women blamed <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> more and men less when <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> had a previous conviction. Hence, gender {{is an important factor}} in explaining variation in blame attributions...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{tests the}} rationalist and intuitionist sequences for forming moral judgments {{about people in}} media, proposed by Lee and Shapiro (2014), and applies those sequences to explaining processes whereby news stories about alcoholrelated crimes influence readers' support for two types of policies: punitive policies aiming to punish perpetrators and preventive policies aiming to prevent alcoholrelated crimes. Following the rationalist sequence, Study 1 tested the role of intentionality. In an experiment, participants were randomly assigned either to the intentional condition (an owner of a liquor shop sold an alcohol beverage to an underage minor intentionally) or to the unintentional condition (the owner sold the beverage unintentionally). Participants blamed and disliked the owner in the intentional condition {{more than in the}} unintentional condition and the increased blame judgment was associated with disliking of the owner and with participants' increased support for both punitive and preventive policies. Study 2, following the intuitionist sequence, tested the role of affective dispositions (i. e., liking or disliking) toward a perpetrator and a victim of a car accident caused by drunk driving. The results supported hypotheses driven by the intuitionist sequence in several ways. First, when <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> was a liked administrator, participants blamed <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> less than when <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> was a disliked administrator. Second, when <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> was a liked administrator, a liked coach victim led participants to blame <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> more than a disliked coach victim; however, no effect of victim was found when <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> was a disliked administrator. Third, when participants were asked about their alcohol use {{at the beginning of the}} study, they supported preventive policies more when <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> was a liked administrator than when <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> was a disliked one. On the other hand, when participants were asked about their alcohol use at the end of the study, participants supported punitive policies less when <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> was a liked administrator than when <b>the</b> <b>perpetrator</b> was a disliked one. Theoretical and practical implications and future study directions are discussed. 2021 - 02 - 0...|$|R
