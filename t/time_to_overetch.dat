40|$|ABSTRACT: This letter reports an {{efficient}} and compatible silicon membrane combining the physical properties of nanospikes and microchannel arrays for mechanical cell lysis. This hierarchical silicon nanospikes membrane {{was created to}} mechanically disrupt cells for a rapid process with high throughput, {{and it can be}} assembled with commercial syringe filter holders. The membrane was fabricated by photoelectrochemical <b>overetching</b> <b>to</b> form ultrasharp nanospikes in situ along the edges of the microchannel arrays. The intracellular protein and nucleic acid concentrations obtained using the proposed membrane within {{a short period of time}} were quantitatively higher than those obtained by routine, conventional acoustic and chemical lysis methods...|$|R
40|$|Endpoint {{detection}} (EPD) is {{a critical}} control functionality for many etch processes, especially for deep silicon etches [1] that terminate on an underlayer. Where this device structure is employed, {{it is vital that}} {{the point at which the}} etch process reaches the underlayer is detected as promptly as possible. This allows for proper management of the <b>overetch</b> <b>to</b> clear all features to the underlayer without running for longer than necessary and introducing lateral notching to the base of the feature [2]. As device requirements have become more stringent, lower open areas and higher aspect ratios have necessitated development of more sensitive techniques to achieve successful endpoint detection and overetch control...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Managers of {{open source}} {{projects}} need <b>to</b> understand <b>time</b> <b>to</b> resolve bugs, which are reported into a bug tracking system {{on a daily}} basis, to make a release plan. Hewett et al. proposed an empirical approach <b>to</b> predicting <b>time</b> required <b>to</b> repair bugs. However, the predictive model did not distinguish between <b>time</b> <b>to</b> modify a firstly-reported bug and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> re-modify a bug. In this paper, toward predicting <b>time</b> <b>to</b> resolve bugs with accuracy, we identify such the differences of time between bug modifications and re-modifications. We have conducted a case study using Firefox project data. As {{a result of this}} case study, we have confirmed that <b>time</b> <b>to</b> resolve a firstly reported bug was shorter than <b>time</b> <b>to</b> re-modify a bug.

40|$|Abstract. Activity {{networks}} {{model the}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> project completion {{based on the}} <b>times</b> <b>to</b> complete various subtasks, some of which can proceed concurrently and others of which are prerequisite to others. Uncertainty in the <b>times</b> <b>to</b> complete subtasks implies uncertainty in the overall <b>time</b> <b>to</b> complete the project. When {{the information about the}} <b>times</b> <b>to</b> complete subtasks is insufficient to fully specify a probability distribution but sufficient to bound the distribution, the problem of making conclusions about <b>time</b> <b>to</b> complete the entire project requires use of second-order probabilistic techniques. An interval-based technique for this is described, and applied to the problem of evaluating activity networks. 1...|$|R

40|$|System {{characteristics}} of a repairable system are studied from a Bayesian viewpoint with different types of priors assumed for unknown parameters, in which the system consists of one active component and one standby component. The detection of standby, the coverage factor and reboot delay of failed components are possibly considered. <b>Time</b> <b>to</b> failure of the components is assumed to follow exponential distribution. <b>Time</b> <b>to</b> repair and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reboot of the failed components also follow exponential distributions. When <b>time</b> <b>to</b> failure, <b>time</b> <b>to</b> repair and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> reboot have uncertain parameters, a Bayesian approach is adopted to evaluate system characteristics. Monte Carlo Simulation is used to derive the posterior distribution for the mean <b>time</b> <b>to</b> system failure and the steady-state availability. Some numerical experiments are performed to illustrate the results derived in this paper. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
