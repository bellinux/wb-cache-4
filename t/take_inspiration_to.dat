40|$|Abstract — We {{introduce}} a wait-and-chase scheme that models the contact times between moving agents within a connectionist construct. The idea that elementary processors move within a network {{to get a}} proper position is borne out both by biological neurons in the brain morphogenesis and by agents within social networks. From the former, we <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> <b>to</b> devise a medium-term project for new artificial neural network training procedures where mobile neurons exchange data only when they are close {{to one another in}} a proper space (are in contact). From the latter, we accumulate mobility tracks experience. We focus on the preliminary step of characterizing the elapsed time between neuron contacts, which results from a spatial process fitting in the family of random processes with memory, where chasing neurons are stochastically driven by the goal of hitting target neurons. Thus, we add an unprecedented mobility model to the literature in the field, introducing a distribution law of the intercontact times that merges features of both negative exponential and Pareto distribution laws. We give a constructive description and implementation of our model, as well as a short analytical form whose parameters are suitably estimated in terms of confidence intervals from experimental data. Numerical experiments show the model and related inference tools to be sufficiently robust to cope with two main requisites for its exploitation in a neural network: the nonindependence of the observed intercontact times and the feasibility of the model inversion problem to infer suitable mobility parameters.

40|$|Abstract—The correct {{management}} of resources that can become unavailable over time and the efficient (in terms of both cost and time) re-allocation of the services they provided before becoming unavailable, is an open problem that arises {{in a wide range}} of application domains. Despite to some differences, many scenarios spanning very different domains, from logistics to industrial automation, from telecommunication to water systems, may be considered as instances of a more general situation, and the actions to take in order to solve the unavailability problem follow similar patterns. In this paper we discuss the implementation of a multiagent system for solving unavailability problems in an artificial-although realistic- scenario which <b>takes</b> <b>inspiration</b> from <b>to</b> the electricity power network domain.

50|$|During early {{development}} a prototype level {{was created to}} ensure the game felt as it should for a traditional Ratchet & Clank game. One of the game's key themes is gravity with various puzzles and gadgets based around the use of gravity. While developing the game inspiration {{for many of the}} gameplay features were taken from previous games in the series. The developers played through many of the previous games and <b>took</b> <b>inspiration</b> <b>to</b> bring back many favorite features and also to tweak the game engine. The 2D sections using Clank were inspired by a concept of turning Clank into a shadow. Insomniac Games' creative director Brian Allgeier used a projector to demonstrate Clank changing gravity. This eventually developed into the 2D Netherverses with gravity changing mechanics. The plot maintains the Ratchet & Clank series' expected humor but also has a scarier direction while exploring the darkness of space. It continues Ratchet's personal story-arc and acts as an epilogue to the Ratchet & Clank Future saga. Into the Nexus was written by TJ Fixman. The villain's connection in finding their species is {{a key part of the}} plot in Into the Nexus and it follows previous Ratchet & Clank games in connecting Ratchet with the villains. The plot is also about Ratchet coming to terms with his decisions in A Crack in Time.|$|R

Although we use a robot born in the engineer field, we have chosen <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> from neurobiology <b>to</b> design its control system for 2 main reasons: ffl first, it could give us interesting, robust, and ready-made solutions to design control architecture. ffl second, biologists are unfortunately often constrained to study only subparts of the brain due to its complexity.

40|$|Patterned thin-films of {{magnetic}} nanoparticles (MNPs) {{can be used}} to make: surfaces for manipulating and sorting cells, sensors, 2 D spin-ices and high-density data storage devices. Conventional manufacture of patterned magnetic thin-films is not environmentally friendly because it uses high temperatures (hundreds of degrees Celsius) and high vacuum, which requires expensive specialised equipment. To tackle these issues, we have <b>taken</b> <b>inspiration</b> from nature <b>to</b> create environmentally friendly patterns of ferromagnetic CoPt using a biotemplating peptide under mild conditions and simple apparatus. Nano-patterning via interference lithography (IL) and micro-patterning using micro-contact printing (μCP) were used to create a peptide resistant mask onto a gold surface under ambient conditions. We redesigned a biotemplating peptide (CGSGKTHEIHSPLLHK) to self-assemble onto gold surfaces, and mineralised the patterns with CoPt at 18 °C in water. Ferromagnetic CoPt is biotemplated by the immobilised peptides, and the patterned MNPs maintain stable magnetic domains. This bioinspired study offers an ecological route towards developing biotemplated magnetic thin-films for use in applications such as sensing, cell manipulation and data storage...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} recent books on ethics (Hirst and Patching 2005, Tanner et al, 2005, Ward, 2006) have {{indicated}} that traditional understandings of journalism "objectivity" {{are in need of}} renovation if they are to sustain the claim as a guide to ethical action. Ward argues for the recasting of the notions of traditional objectivity to offer a "pragmatic objectivity" as an alternative and plausible underpinning to ethical journalism practice. He argues that a recast or "pragmatic objectivity" should respond to the changing rhetorical relationship between journalists and their audiences; and, in so doing, should <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> from attempts <b>to</b> be objective in other domains [...] -professions such as law and public relations in seeking models. This paper seeks to take a step in that direction through illustrating how journalism interviews do "objectivity" through an adaptation of the principles of the "Fourth Estate" to political interviews. It turns such analysis to the ends of establishing the particular "pragmatic ethic" underpinning such practices and how journalism interviewing techniques has allowed for proactive journalists to strike a workable balance between pursuing the public interest and observing the restraining protocols of modern journalistic practice. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a new car is guided {{by a set of}} {{directives}} indicating the target market and specific engineering and aesthetic constraints, which may include also the preservation of the company brand identity or the restyling of products already on the market. When creating a new product designers are used to evaluating other existing products <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>inspiration</b> or <b>to</b> possibly reuse successful solutions. In the perspective of an optimised styling workflow a great benefit could come from the opportunity of easily retrieving the related documentation and existing digital models both from internal and external repositories. In fact, the rapid growth of the web contents and the widely spread adoption of computerassisted design tools have made a huge amount of digital data available, whose exploitation could be improved by more selective retrieval methods. In particular, the retrieval of aesthetic elements may help designers to more efficiently create digital models conforming to specific styling properties. The aim of the research described in this document is the definition of a framework able to support a (semi-) automatic extraction of semantic data from 3 D models and other multimedia data to allow car designers to reuse knowledge and design solutions within the styling department. The first objective is then capturing and structuring both the explicit and implicit elements that contribute to the car aesthetics and can be realistically tackled through computational models and methods. The second step is the definition of a system architecture able to transfer such semantics through an automatic annotation of car models...|$|R

40|$|Basic {{phenomenology}} {{of human}} color vision {{has been widely}} <b>taken</b> as an <b>inspiration</b> <b>to</b> devise explicit color correction algorithms. The behavior of these models in terms of significative image features (such as, e. g., contrast and dispersion) {{can be difficult to}} characterize. To cope with this, we propose to use a variational formulation of color contrast enhancement that is inspired by the basic phenomenology of color perception. In particular, we devise a set of basic requirements to be fulfilled by an energy to be considered as ‘perceptually inspired’, showing that there is an explicit class of functionals satisfying all of them. We single out three explicit functionals that we consider of basic interest, showing similarities and differences with existing models. The minima of such functionals is computed using a gradient descent approach. We also present a general methodology to reduce the computational cost of the algorithms under analysis from O(N 2) to O(N log N), being N the number of input pixels.
