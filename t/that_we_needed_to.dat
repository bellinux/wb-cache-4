The album {{was released}} with fewer tracks in North America as [...]hack//Game Music Best Collection. Patrick Gann of RPGFan wrote that the second disc, which contains music for cutscenes and special events, was stronger than the first disc's generic town and battle themes. He called the soundtrack [...] "techno meets opera", singled out the volume intro tracks for particular praise. Gann noted that the North American release functions as a [...] "Best of" [...] album, but felt that [...] "a lot of solid music [...] missing" [...] in this release. Other reviewers were less enthusiastic; Paul Koehler of RPGamer called the music [...] "particularly bland" [...] and IGN's Dunham lamented that the second installment did not introduce many new pieces.

According to Hutchins, [...] "Conny had an understanding of what hip hop was, and if we had an understanding of how to explain it to these musicians who were far ahead of us, we would've produced some special records. On the next album, we decided <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> get somebody from [...] that understood where we were coming from." [...] Although Jive Records initially hired Russell Simmons and Larry Smith to produce Escape, commitments in New York kept Simmons from recording sessions. Hutchins had met Smith at Disco Fever in New York City; although they were friends and often discussed music, he said that they did not originally consider working together. Jive Records could not find a producer, and Hutchins asked Smith to come to Europe and produce the album. The producer initially refused for financial reasons, but called Hutchins the following day saying that he needed money to pay a hospital bill for a friend who had his finger tips ripped off. Smith and Hutchins then quickly met to develop music to show to the label, recording the bass for [...] "Five Minutes of Funk".|$|E
500|$|Development on Mega Man 3 {{began at}} Capcom {{over a year}} after the release of Mega Man 2. Akira Kitamura, the lead {{supervisor}} for the first two games quit his job at the company during that gap of time. Artist Keiji Inafune, credited as [...] "Inafking", considered Mega Man 3 as one of his least favorite entries in the series due to [...] " [...] what went into the game and what was behind the release of the game." [...] He had [...] "preset notions" [...] about successful development because of the team's good experience with Mega Man 2 and found that his new superior [...] "didn't really understand Mega Man the way his predecessor did". During the game's production, the developers lost the main planner, so Inafune had to take over that job for its completion. Inafune recalled the final two months of development as particularly turbulent, when he had to take responsibility for assessing and dividing up tasks among the team members who were not meeting deadlines. The team was forced to put Mega Man 3 on the market before they thought it was ready. Inafune concluded, [...] "I knew that if we had more time to polish it, we could {{do a lot of things}} better, make it a better game, but the company said <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> release it. The whole environment behind what went into the production of the game is what I least favored. Numbers one and two – I really wanted to make the games; I was so excited about them. Number three – it just turned very different." ...|$|E
500|$|Joel Keller of AOL TV {{wrote that}} [...] "the {{linchpin}} {{of the hour}} was Brittany's belief in Santa Claus." [...] The New York Post Jarett Wieselman called it [...] "adorably realized by actress Heather Morris", and Canning said she [...] "perfectly played up Brittany's innocence and joy surrounding everything Santa". Brown was less enthusiastic, and wrote that she was tiring of the [...] "look how dumb yet kind-hearted Brittany is" [...] plots. Keller approved of the Artie and Brittany coupling, {{and said it was}} [...] "way more fun to watch than Rachel and Finn and all their angst", and Canning felt that the episode's heart was Artie working to keep Brittany from becoming disillusioned about Santa. He also wrote, [...] "shining in this storyline was Dot Jones as Coach Bieste. Her scene as Santa, and then her knowing expression as she watched Artie walk, were the best moments of the episode." [...] Burns agreed: [...] "Coach Bieste's performance as the Santa Claus bearer of harsh reality was quite moving. It's nice to see her get to show her acting chops and refreshing to see her character's vulnerability." [...] Poniewozik also agreed, and said Jones [...] "has been remarkable", [...] "taking every ridiculous moment Glee has thrown at her and finding the true emotion {{at the core of the}} absurdity, which is what Glee at its best does." [...] However, he was disappointed by how the storyline played out: [...] "it didn't feel right that after the story the episode built around Brittany, it then felt <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> see Artie on his feet for it to be a truly happy ending." ...|$|E

500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. It was sort of a purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess you could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E
