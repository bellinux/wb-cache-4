5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the war, McClellan and his family went to Europe (not returning until 1868), during which he did not participate in politics. When he returned, the Democratic Party expressed some interest in nominating him for president again, but {{when it became clear that}} Ulysses S.

McClellan worked on engineering projects in New York City and was offered the position of president of the newly formed University of California.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Morrow {{was chosen}} as <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> for the Senate seat of Thomas Paynter. Paynter {{had decided not to}} seek re-election, and the Democrats {{nominated}} Ollie M. James of Crittenden County. The General Assembly was heavily Democratic and united behind James. On a joint ballot, James defeated Morrow by a vote of 105â€“28. Due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment the next year, this was the last time the Kentucky legislature would elect a senator.|$|E

5|$|The {{political}} career of John C. Breckinridge included {{service in the}} state government of Kentucky, the United States federal government, {{and the government of}} the Confederate States of America. In 1857, at 36 years old, he was inaugurated as James Buchanan's vice president, and remains the youngest person to ever hold the office. Four years later, he ran as the presidential candidate of a dissident group of Southern Democrats, but lost the election to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate,</b> Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
5|$|All {{the while}} Hancock was posted in New York, {{he did his}} best to keep his {{political}} ambitions alive. He received some votes at the Democrats' 1876 convention, but was never a serious contender as New York governor Samuel J. Tilden swept the field on the second ballot. <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate,</b> Rutherford B. Hayes, won the election, and Hancock refocused his ambition on 1880. The electoral crisis of 1876 and the subsequent end to Reconstruction in 1877 convinced many observers that the election of 1880 would give the Democrats their best chance at victory in a generation.|$|E

5|$|By 1877, {{differences}} with the Republican party leadership on the money question led him to consider other options. After initially supporting <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> for governor that year, Weaver joined the Greenback Party in August. In 1878, Weaver accepted the Greenback nomination for Iowa's 6th congressional district. Although Weaver's political career up to then had been as a staunch Republican, Democrats in the 6th district considered that endorsing him was likely {{the only way to}} defeat Ezekiel S. Sampson, the incumbent Republican. Despite objections from some hard-money Democrats, the Greenback-Democrat ticket prevailed, and Weaver was elected with 16,366 votes to Sampson's 14,307.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, Harrison {{entered into}} a law {{partnership}} with William Wallace to form the law office of Wallace and Harrison. Two years later, in 1860, Harrison successfully ran as <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> for reporter of the Indiana Supreme Court. Harrison was an active supporter of the Republican Party's platform and served as Republican State Committee's secretary. After Wallace, his law partner, was elected as county clerk in 1860, Harrison established a new firm with William Fishback that was named Fishback and Harrison. The new partners worked together until Harrison entered the Union Army {{after the start of}} the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Willson {{was chosen}} by acclamation as <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> for governor. Willson's {{opponent}} had been chosen at a nominating convention two years earlier. Governor Beckham had convinced the Democrats to hold their primary early so he could secure the party's nomination for the 1908 senatorial election {{while he was still}} serving as governor. Further, he wanted to influence the selection of his would-be successor. Using his clout as governor, he assured the selection of Samuel Wilbur Hager as the party's gubernatorial nominee.|$|E

Despite the reelection of incumbent Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, the inexperienced Mikan lost by a close margin of 52% to 48%. Wier received 127,356 votes to Mikan's 117,716. Returning {{to the legal}} profession, Mikan was frustrated, after hoping for an influx of work.

5|$|In 1974, Gingrich {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office as <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>candidate</b> in , which stretched from the southern Atlanta suburbs to the Alabama state line. He lost to 20-year incumbent Democrat Jack Flynt by 2,770 votes. Gingrich ran up huge margins in the suburban areas of the district, {{but was unable to}} overcome Flynt's lead in the more rural areas. Gingrich's relative success surprised political analysts. Flynt had never faced a serious challenger; Gingrich was the second Republican to ever run against him. He did well against Flynt although 1974 was a disastrous year for Republican candidates nationally due to fallout from the Watergate scandal of the Nixon administration.|$|E

5|$|A second county {{bill was}} passed by the 1903 {{legislature}} and approved by Governor Dole, forming Maui County and four other counties on the main Hawaiian Islands.
