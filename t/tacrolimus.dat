5|$|Diuretics {{have been}} {{associated}} with attacks of gout. However, a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase risk. Other medications that increase the risk include niacin, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (except losartan), beta blockers, ritonavir, and pyrazinamide. The immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and <b>tacrolimus</b> are also associated with gout, the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide.|$|E
25|$|The Edmonton {{protocol}} uses {{a combination}} of immunosuppressive drugs, including daclizumab (Zenapax), sirolimus (Rapamune) and <b>tacrolimus</b> (Prograf). Daclizumab is given intravenously right after the transplant and then discontinued. Sirolimus and <b>tacrolimus,</b> the two main drugs that keep the immune system from destroying the transplanted islets, must be taken for life.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{similarly}} named <b>tacrolimus,</b> sirolimus {{is not a}} calcineurin inhibitor, but it has {{a similar}} suppressive effect on the immune system. Sirolimus inhibits IL-2 and other cytokines receptor-dependent signal transduction mechanisms, via action on mTOR, and thereby blocks activation of T and B cells. Ciclosporin and <b>tacrolimus</b> inhibit the secretion of IL-2, by inhibiting calcineurin.|$|E
25|$|Topical immunosuppressants like pimecrolimus and <b>tacrolimus</b> may {{be better}} {{in the short term}} and appear equal to steroids after a year of use. Their use is {{reasonable}} in those who do not respond to or are not tolerant of steroids. Treatments are typically recommended for short or fixed periods of time rather than indefinitely. <b>Tacrolimus</b> 0.1% has generally proved more effective than pimecrolimus, and equal in effect to mid-potency topical steroids. There is no link to increased risk of cancer from topical use of 1% pimecrolimus cream.|$|E
25|$|Other {{side effects}} of {{medications}} including gastrointestinal inflammation and ulceration of the stomach and esophagus, hirsutism (excessive hair growth in a male-pattern distribution) with ciclosporin, hair loss with <b>tacrolimus,</b> obesity, acne, diabetes mellitus type 2, hypercholesterolemia, and osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|Kidney {{transplant}} {{recipients are}} discouraged from consuming grapefruit, pomegranate and green tea products. These food products {{are known to}} interact with the transplant medications, specifically <b>tacrolimus,</b> cyclosporin and sirolimus; the blood levels of these drugs may be increased, potentially leading to an overdose.|$|E
25|$|The mode {{of action}} of {{sirolimus}} is to bind the cytosolic protein FK-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) {{in a manner similar}} to <b>tacrolimus.</b> Unlike the tacrolimus-FKBP12 complex, which inhibits calcineurin (PP2B), the sirolimus-FKBP12 complex inhibits the mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin, rapamycin being another name for sirolimus) pathway by directly binding to mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1).|$|E
25|$|The acute uveitis {{phase of}} VKH is usually {{responsive}} to high-dose oral corticosteroids; parenteral administration {{is usually not}} required. However, ocular complications may require an subtenon or intravitreous injection of corticosteroids or bevacizumab. In refractory situations, other immunosuppressives such as cyclosporine, or <b>tacrolimus,</b> antimetabolites (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate), or biological agents such as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or infliximab may be needed.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the variety}} of {{symptoms}} and organ system involvement with SLE, its severity in an individual must be assessed in order to successfully treat SLE. Mild or remittent disease may, sometimes, be safely left untreated. If required, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antimalarials may be used. Medications such as prednisone, mycophenolic acid and <b>tacrolimus</b> {{have been used in}} the past.|$|E
25|$|Reassurance {{that the}} {{condition}} is benign, elimination of precipitating factors and improving oral hygiene are considered initial management for symptomatic OLP, and these measures are reported to be useful. Treatment usually involves topical corticosteroids (such as betamethasone, clobetasol, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone) and analgesics, or if these are ineffective and {{the condition is}} severe, the systemic corticosteroids may be used. Calcineurin inhibitors (such as pimecrolimus, <b>tacrolimus</b> or cyclosporin) are sometimes used.|$|E
25|$|If {{complications}} {{cannot be}} controlled {{or when the}} liver ceases functioning, liver transplantation is necessary. Survival from liver transplantation has been improving over the 1990s, and the five-year survival rate is now around 80%. The survival rate depends largely on the severity of disease and other medical risk factors in the recipient. In the United States, the MELD score is used to prioritize patients for transplantation. Transplantation necessitates the use of immune suppressants (ciclosporin or <b>tacrolimus).</b>|$|E
25|$|Sirolimus {{can also}} be used alone, or in {{conjunction}} with a calcineurin inhibitor (such as <b>tacrolimus),</b> and/or mycophenolate mofetil, to provide steroid-free immunosuppression regimens. Impaired wound healing and thrombocytopenia are a possible side effects of sirolimus; therefore, some transplant centers prefer not to use it immediately after the transplant operation, but instead administer it only after a period of weeks or months. Its optimal role in immunosuppression has not yet been determined, and it remains the subject of a number of ongoing clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|Intrinsic AKI {{refers to}} disease {{processes}} which directly damage the kidney itself. Intrinsic AKI can {{be due to}} {{one or more of the}} kidney's structures including the glomeruli, kidney tubules, or the interstitium. Common causes of each are glomerulonephritis, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), respectively. Other causes of intrinsic AKI are rhabdomyolysis and tumor lysis syndrome. Certain medication classes such as calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., <b>tacrolimus)</b> can also directly damage the tubular cells of the kidney and result in a form of intrinsic AKI.|$|E
25|$|Transplant {{recipients}} {{must take}} immunosuppressive anti-rejection drugs {{for as long}} as the transplanted kidney functions. The routine immunosuppressives are <b>tacrolimus</b> (Prograf), mycophenolate (Cellcept), and prednisolone; these drugs cost US$1,500 per month. In 1999 the United States Congress passed a law that restricts Medicare from paying for more than three years for these drugs, unless the patient is otherwise Medicare-eligible. Transplant programs may not transplant a patient unless the patient has a reasonable plan to pay for medication after the Medicare expires; however, patients are almost never turned down for financial reasons alone. Half of end-stage renal disease patients only have Medicare coverage.|$|E
25|$|Azathioprine {{can cause}} birth defects. A 2003 {{population-based}} study in Denmark {{showed that the}} use of azathioprine and related mercaptopurine resulted in a seven-fold incidence of fetal abnormalities as well as a 20-fold increase in miscarriage. Birth defects in a child whose father was taking azathioprine have also been reported. Although no adequate and well-controlled studies have taken place in humans, when given to animals in doses equivalent to human dosages, teratogenesis was observed. Transplant patients already on this drug should not discontinue on becoming pregnant. This contrasts with the later-developed drugs <b>tacrolimus</b> and mycophenolate, which are contraindicated during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{transplant}} rejection and subsequent damage to the new lung or lungs, patients must take a regimen of immunosuppressive drugs. Patients will normally {{have to take a}} combination of these medicines in order to combat the risk of rejection. This is a lifelong commitment, and must be strictly adhered to. The immunosuppressive regimen is begun just before or after surgery. Usually the regimen includes ciclosporin, azathioprine and corticosteroids, but as episodes of rejection may reoccur throughout a patient's life, the exact choices and dosages of immunosuppressants may have to be modified over time. Sometimes <b>tacrolimus</b> is given instead of ciclosporin and mycophenolate mofetil instead of azathioprine.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{causes of}} {{hyperkalemia}} are discussed as follows. Acute digitalis overdose such as digoxin toxicity may cause hyperkalemia through the inhibition of sodium-potassium-ATPase pump. Massive blood transfusion can cause hyperkalemia in infants due to leakage of potassium {{out of the}} red blood cells during storage. Giving succinylcholine tn patients with conditions such as burns, trauma, infection, prolonged immobilisation can cause hyperkalemia due to widespread activation of acetylcholine receptors rather than a specific group of muscles. Arginine hydrochloride is used to treat refractory metabolic alkalosis. The arginine ions can enter cells and displace potassium out of the cells, causing hyperkalemia. Calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine, <b>tacrolimus,</b> diazoxide, and minoxidil can cause hyperkalemia. Box jellyfish venom can also cause hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|ADRs {{can include}} {{enlargement}} of the gums, convulsions, peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, hypercholesterolemia, dyspnea, numbness and tingling particularly of the lips, pruritus, high blood pressure, potassium retention possibly leading to hyperkalemia, kidney and liver dysfunction (nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity), burning sensations at finger tips, and an increased vulnerability to opportunistic fungal and viral infections. In short, it is nephrotoxic, neurotoxic, {{increases the risk of}} squamous cell carcinoma and infections, and often causes hypertension (due to renal vasoconstriction and increased sodium reabsorption). The latter may result in serious adverse cardiovascular events; thus it is recommended that prescribers find the lowest effective dose for people requiring long term treatment. Ciclosporin also causes {{enlargement of the}} gums and increased hair growth which is not seen with <b>tacrolimus</b> (another calcineurin inhibitor).|$|E
25|$|The {{absorption}} of sirolimus {{into the blood}} stream from the intestine varies widely between patients, with some patients having up to eight times more exposure than others for the same dose. Drug levels are, therefore, taken to make sure patients get the right dose for their condition. This is determined by taking a blood sample before the next dose, which gives the trough level. However, good correlation is noted between trough concentration levels and drug exposure, known as area under the concentration-time curve, for both sirolimus (SRL) and <b>tacrolimus</b> (TAC) (SRL: r2 = 0.83; TAC: r2 = 0.82), so only one level need be taken to know its pharmacokinetic (PK) profile. PK profiles of SRL and of TAC are unaltered by simultaneous administration. Dose-corrected drug exposure of TAC correlates with SRL (r2 = 0.8), so patients have similar bioavailability of both.|$|E
25|$|While {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made in the islet transplantation field, many obstacles remain that currently preclude its widespread application. Two of the most important limitations are the currently inadequate means for preventing islet rejection, and the limited supply of islets for transplantation. Current immunosuppressive regimens are capable of preventing islet failure for months to years, but the agents used in these treatments are expensive and may increase the risk for specific malignancies and opportunistic infections. In addition, and somewhat ironically, the most commonly used agents (like calcineurin inhibitors and rapamycin) are also known to impair normal islet function and/or insulin action. Further, like all medications, the agents have other associated toxicities, with side effects such as oral ulcers, peripheral edema, anemia, weight loss, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diarrhea and fatigue. Perhaps of greatest concern to the patient and physician is the harmful effect of certain widely employed immunosuppressive agents on renal function. For the patient with diabetes, renal function is a crucial factor in determining long-term outcome, and calcineurin inhibitors (<b>tacrolimus</b> and ciclosporin) are significantly nephrotoxic. Thus, while some patients with a pancreas transplant tolerate the immunosuppressive agents well, and for such patients diabetic nephropathy can gradually improve, in other patients the net effect (decreased risk due to the improved blood glucose control, increased risk from the immunosuppressive agents) may worsen kidney function. Indeed, Ojo et al. have published an analysis indicating that among patients receiving other-than-kidney allografts, 7%–21% end up with renal failure as a result of the transplant and/or subsequent immunosuppression.|$|E
500|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} hepatorenal syndrome is liver transplantation, {{and all other}} therapies {{can best be described}} as bridges to transplantation. [...] While liver transplantation is by far the best available management option for HRS, the mortality of individuals with HRS {{has been shown to be}} as high as 25% within the first month after transplantation. [...] Individuals with HRS and evidence of greater hepatic dysfunction (quantified as MELD scores above 36) have been found to be at greatest risk of early mortality after liver transplantation. [...] A further deterioration of kidney function even after liver transplantation in individuals with HRS has been demonstrated in several studies; however, this is transient and thought to be due to the use of medications with toxicity to the kidneys, and specifically the introduction of immunosuppressants such as <b>tacrolimus</b> and cyclosporine that are known to worsen kidney function. [...] Over the long-term, however, individuals with HRS who are the recipients of liver transplants almost universally recover kidney function, and studies show that their survival rates at three years are similar to those who have received liver transplants for reasons other than HRS.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{cyclosporine}} trough levels {{reported to}} be reduced to 100–150ng/ml and <b>tacrolimus</b> levels reduced to 3–5ng/ml ...|$|E
2500|$|Immuno{{suppress}}ant {{drugs are}} used to suppress the immune system from rejecting the donor kidney. These medicines must be taken {{for the rest of}} the recipient's life. The most common medication regimen today is a mixture of <b>tacrolimus,</b> mycophenolate, and prednisolone. Some recipients may instead take ciclosporin, sirolimus, or azathioprine. The risk of early rejection of the transplanted kidney is increased if corticosteroids are avoided or withdrawn after the transplantation. Ciclosporin, considered a breakthrough immunosuppressive when first discovered in the 1980s, ironically causes nephrotoxicity and can result in iatrogenic damage to the newly transplanted kidney. <b>Tacrolimus,</b> which is a similar drug, also causes nephrotoxicity. Blood levels of both must be monitored closely and if the recipient seems to have declining renal function or proteinuria, a biopsy may be necessary to determine whether this is due to rejection [...] or ciclosporin or <b>tacrolimus</b> intoxication [...]|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Stähelin Screen" [...] {{was rapidly}} and very {{successfully}} {{adopted by the}} Japanese pharmaceutical company Fujisawa (now Astellas), which subsequently discovered <b>tacrolimus</b> (FK-506, Prograf), the second clinically used calcineurin inhibitor.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{most other}} allografts, a liver {{transplant}} will be rejected by the recipient unless immunosuppressive drugs are used. [...] The immunosuppressive regimens for all solid organ transplants are fairly similar, {{and a variety of}} agents are now available. [...] Most liver transplant recipients receive corticosteroids plus a calcineurin inhibitor such as <b>tacrolimus</b> or ciclosporin, (also spelled cyclosporine and cyclosporin) plus a purine antagonist such as mycophenolate mofetil. Clinical outcome is better with <b>tacrolimus</b> than with ciclosporin {{during the first year of}} liver transplantation. If the patient has a co-morbidity such as active hepatitis B, high doses of hepatitis B immunoglubins are administrated in liver transplant patients.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cornerstone}} of therapy is reduction in immunosuppression. [...] A recent surge in BKVAN correlates {{with use of}} potent immunosuppressant drugs, such as <b>tacrolimus</b> and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). [...] Studies have not shown any correlation between BKVAN and a single immunosuppressive agent but rather the overall immunosuppressive load.|$|E
2500|$|Auto-immune and {{inflammatory}} kidney disease, such as vasculitis or transplant rejection, may {{be treated}} with immunosuppression. Commonly used agents are prednisone, mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, <b>tacrolimus,</b> everolimus, thymoglobulin and sirolimus. Newer, so-called [...] "biologic drugs" [...] or monoclonal antibodies, are also used in these conditions and include rituximab, basiliximab and eculizumab. Blood products including intravenous immunoglobulin and {{a process known as}} plasma exchange can also be employed.|$|E
2500|$|In DIGO, {{improved}} {{oral hygiene}} and plaque control is still important {{to help reduce}} any inflammatory component that may be contributing to the overgrowth. Reversing and preventing gingival enlargement caused by drugs {{is as easy as}} ceasing drug therapy or substituting to another drug. [...] However, this is not always an option; in such a situation, alternative drug therapy may be employed, if possible, to avoid this deleterious side effect. [...] In the case of immunosuppression, <b>tacrolimus</b> is an available alternative which results in much less severe gingival overgrowth than cyclosporin, but is similarly as nephrotoxic. [...] The dihydropyridine derivative isradipidine can replace nifedipine for some uses of calcium channel blocking and does not induce gingival overgrowth.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rationale}} behind using leflunomide in BKVAN comes from its combined immunosuppressive and antiviral properties. [...] Two studies consisting of 26 and 17 patients who developed BKVAN on a three-drug regimen of <b>tacrolimus,</b> MMF, and steroids had their MMF replaced with leflunomide 20–60mg daily. [...] 84 and 88% of patients, respectively had clearance or a progressive reduction in viral load and a stabilization or improvement of graft function (7). [...] In {{a study conducted}} by Teschner et al. in 2009, 12/13 patients who had their MMF exchanged with leflunomide cleared the virus by 109 days. [...] In a case series, there was improvement or stabilization in 23/26 patients with BKVAN after switching MMF to leflunomide.|$|E
2500|$|... aHUS is not {{the only}} {{condition}} that causes systemic TMA, a fact that makes differential diagnosis essential. Historically, the clinical diagnosis of TMA-causing diseases was grouped into a broad category that (in addition to aHUS) included thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS). However, it is now understood that although aHUS, STEC-HUS, and TTP have similar clinical presentations, they have distinct causes and specific tests can be conducted to differentiate these diseases. In addition, there are other conditions that can cause TMA as a secondary manifestation; these entities include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), malignant hypertension, progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS, also known as scleroderma), the pregnancy-associated HELLP (hemolysis, liver dysfunction, and low platelets) syndrome, and toxic drug reaction (e.g., to cocaine, cyclosporine, or <b>tacrolimus).</b> [...] Nevertheless, aHUS should be suspected in patients presenting with systemic TMA, and appropriate diagnostic work-up should be undertaken.|$|E
2500|$|Ulcerative colitis can {{be treated}} {{with a number of}} medications, {{including}} 5-ASA drugs such as sulfasalazine and mesalazine. Corticosteroids such as prednisone can also be used due to their immunosuppressive and short-term healing properties, but because their risks outweigh their benefits, they are not used long-term in treatment. Immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine and biological agents such as infliximab and adalimumab are given only if people cannot achieve remission with 5-ASA and corticosteroids. Such treatments are used less commonly [...] due to their possible risk factors, including but not limited to increased risk of cancers in teenagers and adults, tuberculosis, and new or worsening heart failure (these side effects are rare). A formulation of budesonide was approved by the FDA for treatment of active ulcerative colitis in January 2013. The evidence on methotrexate does not show a benefit in producing remission in people with ulcerative colitis. Off-label use of drugs such as ciclosporin and <b>tacrolimus</b> has shown some benefits. Fexofenadine, an antihistamine drug used in treatment of allergies, has shown promise in a combination therapy in some studies. Opportunely, low gastrointestinal absorption (or high absorbed drug gastrointestinal secretion) of fexofenadine results in higher concentration at the site of inflammation. Thus, the drug may locally decrease histamine secretion by involved gastrointestinal mast cells and alleviate the inflammation.|$|E
5000|$|LCP-Tacro (<b>tacrolimus)</b> is a once-daily dosage {{version of}} <b>tacrolimus</b> for {{prevention}} of rejection in organ transplant patients in two Phase 3 clinical trials in kidney transplant patients. The first study in stable transplant patients showed that LCP-Tacro was non-inferior in efficacy and safety compared to twice-daily <b>tacrolimus</b> (Prograf®) REF.

50|$|A {{study is}} going on to assess the {{efficacy}} of <b>tacrolimus</b> on Kimura's disease. One case {{has so far been}} described. A patient with refractory Kimura's disease after surgery and treatment with prednisone was treated with <b>tacrolimus.</b> <b>Tacrolimus</b> (FK-506) was administered at an initial dosage of 1 mg every 12 hours, and FK-506 concentration in the blood was monitored monthly. FK-506 blood concentration was controlled within 5 to 15 μg/l. After 6 months, the dosage of <b>tacrolimus</b> was reduced to 0.5 mg daily for another 2 months and then treatment was stopped. Swelling of the bilateral salivary glands disappeared within the first week. No serious side effects were noted and the disease has not recurred in the 2 years of follow-up. <b>Tacrolimus</b> may be an effective treatment for patients with Kimura's disease, but {{more research is needed to}} determine its long-term efficacy and safety, as well as its mechanism of action.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, <b>tacrolimus</b> {{has been}} used to {{suppress}} the inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis (UC), a form of inflammatory bowel disease.
