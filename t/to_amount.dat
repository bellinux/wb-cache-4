5|$|Repairs {{were made}} to the castle between 1610 and 1611 by the captain, Sir George Bampfield, at a cost of £211. A survey in 1623 carried out by Sir Richard Morryson showed the castle to be {{equipped}} with ten iron guns – one culverin, five demi-culverins, two sakers, a minion and a falcon – and garrisoned by its captain, five gunners and three soldiers. It was in a poor condition, and one corner of the gun platform had been undermined by the sea; Morryson's team estimated the likely costs of repairs <b>to</b> <b>amount</b> to £459.|$|E
5|$|Of the film's net profit, {{estimated}} <b>to</b> <b>amount</b> to $30–40million (£20–25million) {{from the}} cinema release alone, roughly 20% will be split between Geoffrey Rush (as executive producer), Tom Hooper and Colin Firth, who receive their bonuses {{before the other}} stakeholders. The remaining profit is to be split equally between the producers and the equity investors. The UK Film Council invested £1million of public funds from the United Kingdom lottery into the film. In March 2011 Variety estimated that the return could be between fifteen and twenty times that. The Council's merger into the British Film Institute means that the profits are {{to be returned to}} that body.|$|E
5|$|Farther inland, as Janet {{dissipated}} {{over the}} mountainous central Mexico, the storm dropped torrential rainfall over the Tamisi and Panuco River basins. The water {{levels in the}} Panuco River remained above flood stage for four weeks. In Tampico, the river flooded neighborhoods, forcing cables to be stretched along roads to prevent people from being swept away. Small boats were also sent to monitor streets. According to some sources, 800people died from the floods, with thousands more being stranded in the city. Tamazunchale was inundated by an overflowing Moctezuma River. The rains caused a landslide in Colonia San Rafael, killing 12people. Heavy rains also impacted Guadalajara, which had previously not been affected by any tropical cyclones earlier in the year. In Maltarana, Jalisco, the Lerma and Duero Rivers overflowed, forcing 800people in the town to evacuate. Farther north, in Sonora, cotton crops damaged by Janet were estimated <b>to</b> <b>amount</b> to $12million in damages. Combined property damage in Mexico from Hurricanes Gladys, Hilda, and Janet was estimated to total $200million, {{nearly half of the}} government's 1955national budget. Although there were no official damage or fatality estimates, at least 1,000people were injured and another 100,000people were made homeless on the Mexican mainland due to Janet.|$|E

This growing demand is manifested in both the increased cargo volumes and the size of vessels that will use the Panama route.

25|$|Revenues vary {{according}} to tax rate, transactions covered, and tax effects on transactions. The Swedish experience with transaction taxes in 1984–91 demonstrates that the net effect on tax revenues {{can be difficult to}} estimate and can even be negative due to reduced trading volumes. Revenues from the transaction tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected <b>to</b> <b>amount</b> to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year but actually amounted to no more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year. Reduced trading volumes also caused a reduction in capital gains tax revenue which entirely offset the transaction tax revenues.|$|E

On 1 October 1975 the Statutory Company created a further 24,000 new shares, bringing its issued capital up to £75,000 in £1 shares. The PLC subscribed for 23,950 of these new shares and the remaining 50 were acquired by {{a director of the}} Statutory Company in order to bring their holding up to the minimum for directors of 250 shares specified in the 1926 Light Railway Order. Directors' shareholdings in the Statutory Company are subject to rights of pre-emption by the PLC and are therefore treated for most purposes as being owned by that company.|$|E
25|$|Category (c): {{substantive}} {{legitimate expectation}} – promise having {{the character of}} a contract. The third form manifests itself when a public authority's promise or practice has resulted in a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit or a particular outcome of a situation. This type of case is likely to arise when the promise is confined to a few individuals, and thus has {{the character of a}} contract. For situations in this third category, such as the present case, the court must determine whether frustration of the expectation would be so unfair as <b>to</b> <b>amount</b> to an abuse of power by the authority. Unless sufficient justification is present, the authority is obliged to act in accordance with what is legitimately expected of it.|$|E
