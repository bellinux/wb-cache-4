40|$|Software {{maintenance}} {{is known to}} be a costly and time consuming activity. Software engineers need to spend a considerable amount of time in understanding the system before maintaining it. This is due to many reasons including the lack of good documentation and the shift of the original developers of the system to other projects or companies. Dynamic analysis techniques, more particularly trace analysis, are used to alleviate the program comprehension problem by offering software engineers a set of techniques that can help them understand the behavioural aspects of software systems. Execution traces however can be extremely large, which makes them cumbersome for effective analysis. There is a need to develop techniques to help software engineers understand the content of large traces despite their massive size. In this thesis, we present, SumTrace, <b>a</b> novel <b>trace</b> analysis technique. SumTrace <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> as input and automatically segments it into smaller and more manageable groups that reflect the execution phases of the traced scenario. The execution phases are summarized to help software engineers understand quickly different parts of the trace without having to analyze its entire content. SumTrace relies on a combination of probabilistic and Gaussian mixture models. We applied SumTrace to the segmentation of large traces, generated from two software systems. The results are very promising. SumTrace is also fast since it only requires only one pass through <b>a</b> <b>trace...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} <b>an</b> algorithm that <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> (i. e., <b>a</b> {{sequence of}} numbers or vectors of numbers) as input, and from that produces a sequence of loop nests that, when run, produces exactly the original sequence. The input format is suitable {{for any kind of}} program execution trace, and the output conforms to standard models of loop nests. The first, most obvious, use of such an algorithm is for program behavior modeling for any measured quantity (memory accesses, number of cache misses, etc.). Finding loops amounts to detecting periodic behavior and provides an explanatory model. The second application is trace compression, i. e., storing the loop nests instead of the original trace. Decompression consists of running the loops, which is easy and fast. A third application is value prediction. Since the algorithm forms loops while reading input, it is able to extrapolate the loop under construction to predict further incoming values. Throughout the paper, we provide examples that explain our algorithms. Moreover, we evaluate trace compression and value prediction on a subset of the SPEC 2000 benchmarks...|$|R

50|$|The stalagmite and stalactite are the {{two main}} {{subsurface}} features in a Carboniferous Limestone area. These are formed when rainwater - a weak carbonic acid capable of dissolving limestone - percolates through it via the grykes and joints underground. This means the limestone is pervious. As this happens the limestone is dissolved and removed in solution. Caverns are often found below the surface in the limestone and as the lime-rich water finds its way underground it begins to drip {{from the roof of}} the cavern. It is cold underground so there is little evaporation but some does <b>take</b> place leaving <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> of limestone on the roof.

40|$|Although it is {{difficult}} in fully clarifying its mechanisms and effects, Deqi still {{can be considered as}} an instant “sign” of acupuncture response of the patient and acupuncturist, which has a significant value in clinic and research. This paper aims to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> history <b>trace</b> to the development of Deqi theory, understand the connotation of Deqi based on Chinese medicine theory, and establish an evaluation methodology accordingly. We believe that Deqi is not only the needling sensation, but also the perception of changes of qi' flowing of the patient elicited by needling on acupoints. The signs of Deqi include the patient’s subjective perception (needling sensation), the objective physiological changes (common referred to the skin redness around the acupoints and the response of brain), and the acupuncturists' perception. Although Deqi is essential for attaining the effect, {{it may not be the}} necessary sign of the ideal efficacy. It is found that the characteristics of Deqi sensations, Deqi’s intensity, time duration, and the propagation will all affect the efficacy. Thus, acupuncturists should pay attention to elicit and control Deqi state, which is also the key point in modern research on the therapeutic implications of Deqi...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} of the phonograph in the late 19 th century started an obsession with the recorded sound as a document of history.

With the growing accessibility of historical audio documents, we need to look critically at these sources and at the possibility to <b>take</b> them as <b>a</b> <b>trace</b> leading to the beginning of a particular part of music history. The present paper shows in which ways we can see the phenomenon of sound recording truly as the beginning of something new and in which cases such an impression can be misleading.
