5|$|Dark, dumpy, aquatic {{birds that}} {{are able to}} forage for food on <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> of rivers. There are five species worldwide, with one {{recorded}} in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|His earlier works {{included}} publications {{on social}} criticism and reform of universities, including The University Game, co-edited with Dennis Lee (1968), <b>The</b> <b>Beds</b> of Academe (1970), and The Holiversity (1973).|$|E
50|$|A {{young couple}} {{trespass}} {{into the building}} and discover <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> They make love on <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> devours them. <b>The</b> artist mocks <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> for its stupidity. Enraged, <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> telekinetically destroys most of the house except for the room it is in.|$|R
5000|$|The brother {{tries to}} {{distract}} <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> {{in order for}} the remaining woman to escape, but instead, it kills him too. At that moment, the demon that created <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> briefly falls asleep, which renders <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> powerless and allows the artist to communicate with the woman. The artist describes a ritual that will destroy <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>The</b> woman carries out the ritual, which teleports <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> out of <b>the</b> room and revives <b>the</b> <b>bed's</b> real [...] "mother," [...] but at the cost of killing the surviving woman. <b>The</b> <b>bed's</b> mother and <b>the</b> demon complete the ritual by having sex, causing <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> to burst into flames and allowing the artist to finally die.|$|R
5000|$|The {{receiver}} stands or crouches at {{the edge}} of <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> facing <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>The</b> active partner lies on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> with their head hanging over the edge of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> backward. <b>The</b> receiver inserts their penis into the partner's mouth, usually to achieve deep throat penetration.|$|R
5|$|Tephrosia apollinea is {{also found}} in the United Arab Emirates and in Oman, where it inhabits the Jiddat al-Harasis desert and dominates <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> of wadis in {{mountains}} such as Jebel Shams.|$|E
5|$|For {{four years}} the workmen, {{some of whom}} brought their families, lived in 300 {{temporary}} wooden bothies either in a field alongside the offices and workshops, opposite the cemetery, or elsewhere {{along the line of}} the tunnel. Day– and night–shift workers lived up to 17 per hut taking turns to use <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> in unsanitary conditions.|$|E
5|$|Paleomagnetic orientations from beds of tephra (volcanic ash) {{that lie}} between {{the layers of}} the Touchet Formation show secular variation, which {{indicates}} that <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> must have been formed by many floods. The purity of the tephra suggests subaerial deposition (the tephra could be mixed with the surrounding sediment if it was deposited in moving water), which indicates a dry period during the ash falls (and hence a hiatus between floods).|$|E
6000|$|Chorus--The bonie lass made <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> to me, [...] The braw lass made <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> to me, [...] I'll ne'er forget {{till the}} day I die, [...] The lass that made <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> to me.|$|R
50|$|Long ago, a demon fell in {{love with}} a woman and conjured up a bed on which to make love to her. The woman died during the act, and, in his grief, the demon wept tears of blood which fell on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and caused it to come to life. While the demon rests, <b>the</b> <b>bed's</b> evil is contained, but once every ten years, the demon wakes, giving <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>the</b> power to {{physically}} eat human beings. Only one man, an artist identified as Aubrey Beardsley, was spared, as <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> condemned him to immortality behind a painting, where he must forever witness <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> taking victims. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> passed from owner to owner until the present day.|$|R
40|$|A rodent immobilizing {{apparatus}} for {{use during}} experimental procedures, dissection, and sample procurement. The apparatus has two (2) points of {{adherence to the}} dissection board, one at the head/jaw region and one at the tail region. Generally, the rodent immobilizing apparatus includes a base, a <b>bed</b> positioned atop <b>the</b> base, a bank disposed along one side of <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> another bank disposed along {{the opposite side of}} <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> a string/wire hook affixed to each bank with string/wire therebetween, and a tail clip/clamp positioned at an inferior portion of <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> is slidable along the banks to accommodate different sized rodents. In operation, an anesthetized/euthanized rodent is positioned supine on <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> slides along <b>the</b> banks, so that the string/wire is hooked within the rodent 2 ̆ 7 s jaw. The tail is clamped to <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> is pulled back to stretch out the rodent, thus immobilizing the rodent completely and rapidly...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Beds</b> of Nogon-Tsav are {{considered}} to be the same age as the Nemegt Formation. This geologic formation has never been dated radiometrically, but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the Maastrichtian stage, {{at the end of the}} Late Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes in}} which Cole {{appeared}} on the ship were done by using a harness {{as if she was}} flying. Because the actress wore green dress and makeup, the normal greenscreen was replaced by bluescreens in the studio. Cole felt it was fun to fly on the harness, but found it painful after a few hours. Gillan was allowed to perform several of her own stunts in the episode. She was excited to learn that her character would fight pirates with swords, and was taught how to handle one with basic moves. Gillan was also allowed to swing across the ship. However, a stunt double was required to film the sequence where Amy is thrown across the deck by the Siren. The sickbay set was also built in a studio. Because <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> were attached to strings, they were prone to swaying. The cast members who were asked to lie on <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> were instructed to stay still and not breathe heavily to limit movement.|$|E
5|$|The walled garden, coach house, and {{dovecote}} {{were retained}} at the public's request {{when the house}} was demolished. On 6September 1974, the garden walls and remaining buildings were awarded Grade II listed status. The herb garden was planted across the four centre beds in 1977 to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. These included Artemisia, catmint, Santolina and curry plants. To keep the plants within <b>the</b> <b>beds,</b> each was lined by box in 1983.|$|E
5000|$|Furthermore, {{an object}} {{with a higher}} density than <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> will sink, whereas an object with a lower density than <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> will float, thus <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> can be {{considered}} to exhibit the fluid behavior expected of Archimedes' principle. As the [...] "density", (actually the solid volume fraction of the suspension), of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> can be altered by changing the fluid fraction, objects with different densities comparative to <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> can, by altering either the fluid or solid fraction, be caused to sink or float.|$|R
30|$|In {{the field}} of combustion, the air flow rate plays a number of {{important}} roles; primarily providing a cushion of air which <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> will sit upon as well as mixing <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> material. This high mixing is the key factor in achieving a uniform combustion temperature {{as well as in the}} oxidation of combustion materials. In practice, the expansion of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> materials in <b>the</b> combustor is almost controlled and limited by the pressure drop across <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> hydrodynamic properties such as <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> pressure drop and minimum fluidization velocity are the most important parameters studied in the numerical modelling of fluidized beds. To achieve and maintain a stable fluidization, knowledge about the pressure drop across <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and minimum fluidization velocity of the gas flow introduced from the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> are required. Therefore the minimum fluidization air velocity to fluidize the sand particles and pressure drop are crucial hydrodynamic parameters for analysing the operation and design of fluidized <b>bed</b> combustors. <b>The</b> minimum fluidization velocity was determined experimentally by measuring the pressure drop through <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of particles. <b>The</b> pressure drop is defined as the difference of absolute pressure under <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> to that of the area above <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> which is called the freeboard [16, 17].|$|R
40|$|Different {{aspects that}} {{influence}} <b>the</b> fluidized <b>bed</b> particulate coating process have been investigated. An {{easy to use}} procedure for creating temperature and humidity profiles for the gas inside <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> was developed. <b>The</b> procedure involves measuring {{a limited number of}} points inside <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and using these points generate more data points used for the creation of the profiles. The profiles revealed that different parts of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> have a different involvement in the coating process. Apart from showing the hydrodynamic conditions inside <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>the</b> profiles can be used to optimize the size of <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> to map <b>the</b> net migration of particles and to set the spraying rate limits...|$|R
5|$|Troop sleeper #7437 is {{on display}} at the B Railroad Museum in Baltimore, MD. It was {{purchased}} as surplus by the Western Maryland Railroad and used on work trains as crew quarters. The museum has restored it to its original outside appearance. The inside has half <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> put back and the other half has displays about the B RR during the war.|$|E
5|$|Variety in texture, {{height and}} timing of floral display were equally {{important}} horticultural considerations. <b>The</b> <b>beds</b> around each headstone are planted {{with a mixture of}} floribunda roses and herbaceous perennials. Low-growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones, ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during rain. In cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers, dwarf varieties of plants are used instead.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{appear in}} the Radstock district, and surrounding Somerset Coalfield (largely concealed by Triassic and newer rocks). There are two series of coal-bearing sandstones and shales separated by Pennant Sandstone. Locally <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> are folded and faulted. There were mines in the Radstock and Nailsea areas but these have closed. This {{was one of the}} first areas in the world to undergo systematic geological study and mapping by John Strachey and William Smith in the 18th century. They observed the rock layers, or strata, which led Smith to the creation of a testable hypothesis, which he termed the Principle of Faunal Succession.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 Presentation date: 1973 - 05 - 03 Sediment {{transport}} in a gravel-bottomed stream {{located in}} the Oregon Coast Range was studied {{to determine the effects}} of a single layer of large particles (the armour layer) located at the surface of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> material. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> load transport system was studied jointly with suspended sediment transport to understand the total transport system. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> load was sampled using a vortex trough in <b>the</b> stream <b>bed</b> which transported <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> load material into a sampling pit adjacent to the stream. It was found that the armour layer controls <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> load transport system by preventing sand and finer material from <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> from being entrained in the flow unless the armouring particles are first moved. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> load of an armoured stream can be calculated using <b>the</b> simplified Einstein <b>bed</b> load function with a representative diameter for the stability parameter equal to the particle size of armouring material at which 35...|$|R

5000|$|In the {{hospitality}} industry, turndown service {{refers to the}} practice of staff entering a guest's room and [...] "turning down" [...] <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> linen of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> in <b>the</b> room, preparing <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> for use. In the United States, an item of confectionery such as a chocolate or a mint is typically left on top of a pillow in <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> that has been turned down.|$|R
5|$|Most bogs {{exist in}} glaciated areas, but Black Moshannon State Park {{is on the}} Allegheny Plateau. This area was not covered by glaciers during the last ice age. The bogs formed here because of <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> of {{sandstone}} that lie flat, a short distance {{below the surface of}} the earth. The sandstone formations in the park do not absorb water very well, so any depression in them will collect water, as has happened here. The bogs extend the shores of the lake. Migratory shorebirds that visit here include greater and lesser yellowlegs, least sandpiper, solitary sandpiper, and the spotted sandpiper, which has been confirmed as using the IBA as a breeding grounds.|$|E
5|$|Remains {{similar to}} the American white ibis {{have been found in}} Middle Pliocene {{deposits}} of the Bone Valley formation in central Florida, and Lower Pliocene deposits of the Yorktown Formation at Lee Creek in North Carolina. Two species, one living and one extinct, have been recovered from the Talara Tar Seeps in northern coastal Peru. Eudocimus peruvianus was described from a tarsometatarsus that differed slightly from E.albus, whose remains were also found there. Remains of neither species are common in <b>the</b> <b>beds.</b> The tar seeps have been dated at 13,900 years old. The American white ibis is still found in Peru.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding the {{southern}} part of Lake Okeechobee is the Fort Thompson Formation, made of dense, hard limestone, shells, and sand. Rain water is less likely to erode the limestone to form solution holes—smaller versions of sinkholes that do not intersect with the water table. In this formation <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> are generally impermeable. Underneath the metropolitan areas of Palm Beach County is the Anastasia Formation, composed of shelly limestone, coquina, and sand representing a former mangrove or salt marsh. The Anastasia Formation is much more permeable and filled with pocks and solution holes. The Fort Thompson and Anastasia Formations, and Miami Limestone and (x), were formed during the Sangamon interglacial period.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>bed</b> {{assigned}} to Wesley Williams was later to be <b>the</b> same <b>bed</b> {{assigned to}} any black fireman in any firehouse {{where he was}} assigned to perform duty. In Engine 55 it was <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> next to <b>the</b> toilet. No white fireman used <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> even though <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> linen was changed after each man finished a night tour. This [...] "black bed" [...] became a source of bitter contention for many years in many firehouses.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3 a, most of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> {{materials}} are accumulated {{at the front}} of the lower part of the flume, and three maximum thickness conditions of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> materials are used here, which include 13, 16 and 19. Furthermore, the accumulated shape of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> materials in <b>the</b> flume is an irregular triangle, and the accumulation thickness is decreased with decreasing height. Once the debris avalanche is initiated, <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> materials will be entrained by the sliding masses, and the final accumulation shape of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> materials will be changed. As shown in Fig.  3 b, the entrainment profile refers to <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> materials accumulated in the flume, and the entrainment depth is the difference between the original profile and the entrainment profile of <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> materials (where <b>the</b> maximum entrainment depth is the corresponding maximum value).|$|R
50|$|One {{of the two}} {{remaining}} women sleeps on <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> She wakes before it can eat her, but {{as she tries to}} escape, <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> snares her in its sheets and drags her back to be eaten. The last woman unsuccessfully tries to save her. The brother locates the surviving woman, only to have <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> trap them both to eat later. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> tortures them both with nightmares.|$|R
5|$|The gastrotrichs (phylum Gastrotricha), {{commonly}} referred to as hairybacks, are a group of microscopic (0.06-3.0mm), worm-like, pseudocoelomate animals, and are widely distributed and abundant in freshwater and marine environments. They are mostly benthic and live within the periphyton, the layer of tiny organisms and detritus that is found on the seabed and <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> of other water bodies. The majority live on and between particles of sediment or on other submerged surfaces, but a few species are terrestrial and live on land in the film of water surrounding grains of soil. Gastrotrichs are divided into two orders, the Macrodasyida which are marine (except for two species), and the Chaetonotida, some of which are marine and some freshwater. Nearly eight hundred species of gastrotrich have been described.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} part of the commune is hilly but relatively favorable to agriculture, while the southern part is flat and characterized by sand dunes. Sixteen caves are found within the area. The earth is mainly composed of stony rocks, sandy loam soils, and clay loam soils in <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> of wadis in the area. The soils in the hills have pockets of alluvium and sandy loam suitable for crop development, particularly on the hillsides and {{at the foot of the}} hills. Clay loam soils are found in the bowls and beds of wadis, which although suitable for farming are susceptible to gully and water erosion during the rainy season.|$|E
5|$|But geology also {{provided}} an alternate route, albeit across foreign territory. The valleys of the Red and Minnesota Rivers lay in <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> of Glacial Lake Agassiz and its prehistoric outlet Glacial River Warren; the lands exposed when these {{bodies of water}} receded were flat plains between low uplands covered by prairie grasslands. At the Traverse Gap, only a mile (1.6 km) of land separated the Bois des Sioux River, a source stream of the Red (which flowed north to Hudson Bay) and the Little Minnesota River, a source stream of the Minnesota River (tributary to the Mississippi, which flowed south to the Gulf of Mexico). The valley floors and uplands of the watercourses along this gently graded route provided a natural thoroughfare to the south. The eyes of the colonists therefore turned to the new United States, both {{as a source of}} supplies and an (illegal) outlet for their furs.|$|E
50|$|Air {{volume in}} the {{chambers}} may be regulated {{so as to}} make <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> firmer when <b>the</b> patient is first being placed on <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and then air is released to allow for a more conformal shape once lying flat across <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> surface.|$|R
25|$|Bed load {{moves by}} rolling, sliding, and hopping (or saltating) over <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and moves {{at a small}} {{fraction}} of the fluid flow velocity. Bed load is generally thought to constitute 5-10% of the total sediment load in a stream, making it less important in terms of mass balance. However, <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> material load (<b>the</b> <b>bed</b> load plus <b>the</b> portion of the suspended load which comprises material derived from <b>the</b> <b>bed)</b> is often dominated by bed load, especially in gravel-bed rivers. This bed material load is the only part of the sediment load that actively interacts with <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> load is an important component of that, it plays a major role in controlling the morphology of the channel.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is very {{important}} for reservoir management to estimate the sedimentation amount deposited in a reservoir. Firstly, the formula for estimating <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> load transport rate in <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of sand waves of prototype by model experiment was derived based on the similarity of grain Froude number; Secondly, several model experiments that <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> forms is similar with the prototype were carried, and the formula was verified. As a result, when the ratio of grain diameter in the prototype and model is great enough, and <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> forms in <b>the</b> model is similar with that in the prototype, a satisfactory result can be obtained by using the estimation formula for estimating <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> load transport rate of the prototype that sand waves occur in <b>the</b> <b>bed...</b>|$|R
