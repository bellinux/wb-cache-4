40|$|There is an {{increased}} use of thin-walled (t< 4 mm) hollow sections {{in the manufacture of}} lighting poles, traffic sign supports,swing-ploughs, linkage graders, trailers and haymakers. These structures are subjected to fatigue loading. A review of current fatigue design guidelines showed that {{there is a lack of}} design rules for nodal joints made up of thin-walled (t< 4 mm) hollow sections. This paper describes the tests carried out on welded thin-walled (t< 4 mm) tube-to-tube <b>T-connections</b> made up of square hollow sections under cyclic in-plane bending. Different failure modes were obtained during fatigue testing. The experimental stress concentration factors determined in this investigation were found to be significantly lower than the stress concentration factors from the existing parametric equations from the International Institute of Welding. The design Sr. hs-N curves have been determined for the hot spot stress method from Sr. hs-N data based on both experimental and parametric equation stress concentration factors. Design Sr. hs-N curves have been derived from the fatigue data using least-squares method.

The pump was activated 5 - 10 min before PET measurements. <b>T-connections</b> in the shunt allowed monitoring of blood pressure via a pressure transducer, intravenous infusion and the insertion of a probe tip into the blood. The arterial catheter was shortened such that the distance between artery and probe was 10 - 15 cm. Distal to the probe the shunt was 37 cm in length (including the peristaltic pump tubing) and the venous catheter was also shortened to a length of 10 - 15 cm. For the collection of blood samples for manual counting, a second arterial catheter was implanted in the second femoral artery.|$|R
40|$|Modern {{district}} heating systems, a carbon lean technology, involves dual {{usage of the}} energy due to the possibility to redistribute heat derived from numerous sources, such as industrial processes, refuse incineration, geothermal sources and {{combined heat and power}} plants. Such heat source flexibility facilitates the optimal usage of energy resources by varying the amount of purchased heat depending on demand, price and availability. As a result, the operating conditions are never stable and involve pronounced thermal and hydraulic transient regimes, in particular, temperature waves combined with temperature fluctuations. The prediction tools used for these phenomena have been applied for the optimization of the operational regimes. There is however, a need to identify the limitations of the prediction tools and to also improve the methods for more accurate simulations, to enable extended usage of the benefits of these tools in the understanding of transient heat transfer mechanics and to develop effective operational strategies. This work has been concerned with the modelling of turbulent flow and heat transfer phenomena in pipes in {{district heating}} systems, especially focusing on transient temperature propagation. Both simplified models and turbulence models have been used and their performances have been assessed against experimental data. In the simplified model, the fluid flow conditions were simplified by assuming a non-viscous fluid flow, contrary to the turbulence models, where the complex flow patterns occurring in pipe bends and <b>T-connections</b> were simulated in details. In both cases, the pipe flow was treated as a conjugated heat transfer problem, i. e., it included the effect of pipe wall heat conduction. The limitations of simplified approaches have been examined for the following cases: district heating pipelines, and the Neastved and Madumvej district heating networks located in Denmark. Simplified approaches provided a good approximation, particularly for representing the time delay in a system, {{as long as it is}} not used to predict the temperature value at a specific time during the emergence of the temperature changes. These values deviated from the measured values markedly for i) relatively large and sudden temperature changes at the network inlet and ii) low velocities combined with low turbulent Reynolds numbers. Other factors that can affect the temperature wave propagation throughout the network were also discussed in this work. The performance of turbulence models, including different versions of high Reynolds number two-equation models, (mostly k-epsilon type), have been investigated for a pipe-network fragment of a district heating system. Available experimental data has been used for validation. A methodology for analysing the transient temperature propagation was proposed, where transient values are in principle not linked with the average thermal level of the system. The strength and weakness of the above-mentioned models are discussed in this thesis. Moreover, heat transfer was modelled in a counter-flow double pipe arrangement (i. e., two adjacent pipes placed in a common insulation), which is practically applied in domestic hot water systems. The heat transfer coefficient and temperature distributions were predicted for typical operating regimes in such systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{methods to}} determine additional loads bolts susceptible to fatigue-T connections. The {{reason for this}} exercise is the desire to increase the level of knowledge in this area. There is very little in literature and standards on this subject. The target {{of the study was}} to gain overview of existing formulas to calculate prying forces in <b>T-connections</b> subjected to dynamic loads. The results should be compared against analysis in Ansys Workbench. If possible, it would also be prepared separate formulas that would be verified against Ansys Workbench. It should also draw up a supervisor who showed step by step how an analysis of additional forces could be estimated in Ansys Workbench. It has been carried out literature studies of screw charts, calculations of prying forces and fatigue standards to get an overview of the effects that affected screw. To test out theories it have been set up models in Ansys. These have been tried up against theory of both prying forces and screw chart. The studies of the screw charts has led to two main theories. One calculating the compressed parts using pressure cone, Shigly [2] and the other uses a cylinder, Waløen [1]. It turns out that the theory that uses pressure cone coincides best with Ansys results. This is also much more complicated to use. Evidence indicates that Ansys analysis is very conservative, yet both methods fall conservatively into practice. Evidence indicates that, since the method of cylinder is mostly used in Norway. The studies of prying forces has headed to two equations which predict prying forces and the smallest flange thickness these formulas apply. The formulas are very similar in their structure, but one is more conservative than the other. It's just the most conservative formula that provides opportunities for fatigue analysis. These fatigue analysis is also little nuanced and provides only the result that says less than 20, 000 cycles, between 20, 000 and 500, 000 and over 500, 000 cycles, screw guide [3]. From these data, it constructed a fatigue curve to compare with Ansys analyzes. These comparisons do not coincide very well. More factors than prying forces play a role when we look at fatigue. By prying forces we also get a bending effect in the screw. This often generate bending stresses which give almost equally large changes inn stress range in many cases, as prying forces alone. Of fatigue standards it has been looked in to DNV-RP-C 203 [6] and EN 1993 - 1 - 9 [5]. The literature does not say anything about witch fatigue curve that is suitable if you have prying forces. DNV-RP-C 203; W 2 and EN 1993 - 1 - 9; 40 is used in this report. These curves are also almost identical. The formulas for prying forces don’t say anything about stress range. It is actually stress range who is used in the fatigue standards. It's also bean created formulas to calculate the lifetime of bolts by susceptible to fatigue T-pieces based on the formulas that have been examined in the report. This formula publishes stress range, so it can be used with fatigue standards. The result of the comparison with Ansys, gives a curve on the conservative side. This formulas is very extensive and complicated, so it is relatively easy to get a calculation error along the way. Finally, it has bean produced a guide to determine stress range in Ansys. The model in this guide is design so all dimensions can be changed easily inside Ansys. This makes it possible to calculate models with other dimensions than the model initially...|$|R

50|$|The {{steaming}} area {{is covered}} with a special steaming sheet and weighted all around as with sheet steaming. The steam is injected underneath the sheet through an injector and protection tunnel. While with short areas up to 30 m length steam is frontally injected, with longer areas steam is induced {{in the middle of the}} beet using a <b>T-connection</b> branching out to both sides. As soon as the sheet is inflated to approximately 1 m by the steam pressure, the suction turbine is switched on. First, the air in the soil is removed via the suction hoses. A partial vacuum is formed and the steam is pulled downward. During the final phase, when the required steaming depth has been reached, the ventilator runs non-stop and surplus steam is blown out. To ensure that this surplus steam is not lost, it is fed back under the sheet. As with all other steaming systems, a post-steaming period of approximately 20-30 minutes is required. Steaming time is approximately 1 hour per 10 cm steaming depth. The steam requirement is approximately 7-8 kg/m². The most important requirement, as with all steaming systems, is that the soil is well loosened before steaming, to ensure optimal penetration.|$|E

Methods using blood sampling to determine IF may have sufficient volume to measure metabolites directly.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{hypothesis}} that welded hollow section connections, which have circular hollow section (CHS) branch (or bracing or web) members welded to a rectangular hollow section (RHS) chord member, may be converted into “equivalent” connections whereby the circular branch member {{is replaced by a}} square branch member. Although this notion has existed for the static design of such connections, its implementation into design recommendations or specifications has never been checked against existing test data. This is performed herein, using a database of gapped and overlapped CHS-to-RHS N-connection tests undertaken by others, and the suitability of this procedure is examined for both existing and proposed new static design recommendations for RHS welded connections. For fatigue design, no design guidance exists for CHS-to-RHS welded connections. Thus, a database of welded CHS-to-RHS <b>T-connection</b> fatigue tests, undertaken by both the authors and others, under branch axial loading or branch in-plane bending, is used to evaluate the replacement of the circular branch with an equivalent square branch, in the context of contemporary fatigue design procedures. It is shown that, for the connection types examined, this substitution of a circular branch member by an equivalent square branch member is a valid operation, with an adequate level of safety, for both the static and fatigue design of such connections. This indicates that existing design rules for planar RHS-to-RHS welded connections can likely suffice for the unusual case of CHS-to-RHS welded connections...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} the influence of loading history and the processes of materialdegradation on the initiation of cracking and on durability under creep and fatigue conditions. Design/methodology/approach: The aim of the research was to identify the properties of the material of thefittings cut out of a start-up pipeline connecting two OP- 140 boilers with turbines, as well as to identify thereasons of failure of these parts after 100000 hours of operation. Results of the investigations were the basisof predicting the lifetime of machine parts and components of devices subjected to complex mechanical andthermal influence. Numerical simulation of work conditions was also performed. Problem of life assessment ofthe pipelines is currently the object of interest of many research centers. Findings: Due to extreme conditions of the start-up pipeline operation, its T-connections are subject to quickwear, and their properties determine the operational reliability and safety of the whole pipeline.

40|$|Hollow section {{members are}} widely used in {{industrial}} applications {{for the design of}} many machine and structural components. These components are often fabricated at lower cost by welding rather than by casting or forging. For instance, in agricultural machinery, the hollow tubes are typically connected together through welding to form T-joints. Such T-joint connections are also employed in other engineering applications such as construction machinery, offshore structures, bridges, and vehicle frames. In this dissertation, the behaviour of tubular T-joint connections, in particular square hollow section (SHS) -to-SHS T-joints, subjected to static and cyclic loads is studied both experimentally and numerically. The techniques used for the fabrication of the T-joint connections can affect their strengths to different degrees. With modern advances in manufacturing technologies, there are many alternatives for the fabrication of the T-joint connections. For instance, in recent years, the use of the laser beam has become increasingly common in industrial applications. From a manufacturing point of view, the T-joint connections can be fabricated by using traditional mechanical cutting or laser cutting techniques. Currently, for the fabrication of the T-joint connections, the straight edge of one tube is cut using mechanical tools (e. g., flame cutting) and then welded to the body of the other tube. A major contribution of this research work is investigating the feasibility of using laser cutting to produce welded square hollow-section T-joints with similar or higher fatigue strengths than their conventional mechanical cut counterparts. For this purpose, a total of 21 full-scale T-joint samples, typical of those found in the agricultural machinery, are included for the study. Finite Element (FE) models of the T-joints manufactured with the different cutting techniques are also developed and the FE results are verified with the experiments. The results of the numerical and experimental study on the full-scale T-joint samples show that the fatigue strength of the samples that are manufactured with laser cutting is higher than those fabricated with conventional mechanical cutting. From a structural analysis view point, despite of the wide use of tubular T-joint connections as efficient load carrying members, a practical but yet simple and accurate approach for their design and analysis is not available. For this purpose, engineers must often prepare relatively complicated and time consuming FE models made up of shell or solid elements. This is because unlike solid-section members, when hollow section members are subjected to general loadings, they may experience severe deformations of their cross-sections that results in stress concentrations in the connection’s vicinity. One of the objectives/contributions of this research work is the better understanding of the behaviour of SHS-to-SHS T-joint connections under in-plane bending (IPB) and out-of-plane bending (OPB) loading conditions. Through a detailed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) using shell and solid elements, the stiffness and stress distribution at the connection of the tubular T-joints are obtained for different loading conditions. It is observed that at a short distance away from the connection of the T-joints, the structure behaves similar to beams when subjected to loadings. The beam like stresses cease to be valid only {{in the vicinity of the}} connection. Therefore, several parameters are defined to recognize the joint’s stress concentrations and the bending stiffness reduction. These parameters permit the accurate modelling of the tubes and the <b>T-connection</b> by simple beam elements with certain modifications. The models consisting of beam elements are significantly easier to prepare and analyze. Through several numerical examples, it is shown that the modified beam models provide accurately all important information of the structural analysis (i. e. the stresses, displacements, reaction forces, and the natural frequencies) at substantially reduced computational effort in comparison with the complicated Finite Element (FE) models built of shell or solid elements. Another contribution of this research work is the FE modelling of the weld geometry and its effect on the stresses at the vicinity of the connection. The results of the FE modelling are verified through a detailed experimental study. For the experimental study, two test fixtures with hydraulic actuators capable of applying both static and cyclic loadings are designed and used. Strain gauges are installed at several locations on full-scale T-joint samples to validate the developed FE models. It is shown that the membrane stresses which occur at the mid-surface of the tubes remain similar regardless of the weld geometry. The weld geometry only affects the bending stresses. It is also shown that this effect on bending stresses is highly localized and disappears at a distance of about half of the weld thickness away from the weld-toe. To reduce the stress concentrations at the T-joint, plate reinforcements are used in a number of different arrangements and dimensions to increase the load carrying capacity of the connection...|$|E
40|$|Objective and {{subjective}} road {{safety of the}} Rhenen-Achterberg intersection on the N 233 provincial road : Inventory of concerns among residents, survey among (parents of) students and assessment of the current and future traffic situation. The province of Utrecht asked SWOV to investigate the objective {{and subjective}} traffic safety {{at the intersection of}} the Bergweg/Achterbergsestraatweg and provincial road N 233. It is an intersection between a 80 km/h rural distributor road under the authority of the province of Utrecht and a 50 km/h urban distributor respectively 60 km/h semi-urban access road under the authority of the municipality of Rhenen. Along the N 233 there are separate (one-way) cycle paths. The intersection is signal controlled and has separate at-grade bicycle and pedestrian crossing facilities. Parallel to the N 233 is a railway line. The railway crossing is at grade but fully guarded. The intersection is relatively busy. In the near future the province of Utrecht wants to redesign and upgrade the N 233. In the new situation extra through lanes on the N 233 will be provided to increase capacity at the intersection and extra lanes will be constructed on the Achterbergsestraatweg-East. The N 233 will also be provided with a physical median {{in the form of a}} centre island. On the west side a bicycle link will also be constructed between Achterbergsestraatweg-West and the cycle path along the southern part of the N 233. The bicycle and pedestrian crossings remain at-grade crossings. New traffic signals and adapted signal plans will be implemented. The new timing plans provide for a dedicated (conflict-free) signal phase for cyclists (green light for all cyclists while all other traffic has a red signal). In this way conflicts cannot occur if all road users abide by the rules. The residents action group WWVO (abbreviation of ‘We Want to Cross Safely’ in Dutch) considers the intersection dangerous and does not agree that the proposed new design of the Province will resolve the problems. The residents action group is concerned about cyclists (mainly students) who need to cross the intersection. WWVO has prepared an alternative design for the intersection which incorporates a grade separated crossing for traffic crossing from East to West and vice versa. The study addresses the following research questions: 1. What are the concerns of WWVO regarding the N 233 intersection Rhenen-Achterberg and can these concerns be objectified 2. How can the concerns of WWVO be objectively measured and what is the outcome? 3. Do the reconstruction proposals take into account the observed road (safety) problems and do these proposals meet the road safety requirements? Does the design of the new situation take into account possible red light violations, near misses, bicycle-bicycle conflicts, presence and violations of freight traffic, cycling speed from the Bergweg and driving speeds? What are the advantages and disadvantages of a grade-separated junction for a safe crossing? The study was carried out by conducting an extensive interview with members of WWVO and with the municipality of Rhenen to make an inventory of their concerns. In addition, traffic counts were carried out and camera footage was taken of the intersection to assess the concerns. A crash analysis was completed and a attitudinal survey was held among secondary school students and parents of children who have to cross the intersection. Finally, the design proposals of the province of Utrecht and WWVO were assessed. Concerns WWVO In an extensive interview with WWVO the project group revealed seven primary concerns about the current and future traffic situation at the intersection. These were (in no particular order) : - Segregation effect resulting in changed travel patterns (called changed travel demand, resulting from fewer trips by bicycle, detours, trips accompanied by parents etc.) - red light violations - near-misses - bicycle-bicycle conflicts - freight transport - downhill cycling speed - driving speeds at the intersection. Crash analysis It should be noted that crash analyses use data from the police crash registration. Since 2010, the registration rate of the (injury) crashes has declined considerably in comparison with previous years. In addition, the registration rate of non-fatal crashes (and especially of crashes with material damage only) has always been low. Therefore it is very likely that the registered crash data for this location in the period after 2010 are even less complete than the registered data in the period before 2010. Consequently the number of (injury) crashes according to the registration is an underestimation of the actual number of crashes at the intersection. An analysis of the registered crashes in the period 2000 - 2013 shows that 33 crashes occurred during this period, 12 of which were injury crashes. The 18 casualties in these crashes sustained injuries ranging from minor injury to injury that required hospitalization. No fatal crashes occurred on the intersection during this period. Most crashes were side impacts or rear-end collisions. Passenger cars were the predominant mode involved in crashes (42 vehicles) and in a small number of cases they were slow traffic (one cyclist, one slow moped rider, and five moped riders). No crashes were recorded involving pedestrians. In a previous quick-scan, SWOV conducted an analysis on the crash data for the period 2001 - 2009. In this period 16 crashes were registered, 11 of which were injury crashes and none were fatal. The crashes in the period 2001 - 2009 present a slightly alarming picture. The intersection could be labelled a ' black spot ', depending on which years are considered and which definition of a black spot is applied (generally more than six injury crashes in three years). Due to the declining registration rate since 2010, it is unknown whether this location still could be regarded as a black spot. Changed travel demand The survey among (parents of) school-age children who have to cross the intersection shows that in the current situation few children make a detour because parents or children find the intersection unsafe (segregation effect). This is the case both for children in primary school as well as in secondary school. On the basis of the survey we estimate approximately 10 % of trips are affected by the segregation effect of the intersection. Furthermore, the survey reveals that relatively more primary school children in the ages from 8 to 12 years old are accompanied (by parents or older children) when travelling to school than was found for Dutch children nationally. Also the age at which children travel to school independently is higher in Achterberg and environment than was found in the earlier Dutch study (10 years old in Achterberg vs 8 years old nationally). It is also noticeable that relatively many primary school children are brought to school by car. The number of children who walk to school is low and this is possibly due to the distance between home and primary school. The question of how children would be allowed to go to school if the intersection was to be provided with a grade-separated crossing facility (e. g. an overpass), shows a remarkable shift. In the age group of children of 4 - 7 years old, 23 % would be allowed to cycle to school independently, compared to 2 % in the current situation. Considering the big shift, this outcome is difficult to interpret. The data for children nationally reveal that children in this age group are generally escorted to school and do not travel independently. The same picture emerges for the 8 - 12 -year-old primary school students. The shift is even bigger for this age group: the number of children that would be allowed to cycle independently would increase to as much as 88 %, compared to 43 % in the current situation. Once again this result does not match the national trend where the proportion travelling independently is much lower. Therefore the interpretation of this data must be done with some care: it is not certain that a grade-separated junction would actually result in such a big shift in travel patterns. However, it is clear that many parents would consider an alternative transport mode for their school-going children. Present traffic situation The traffic volumes on the main approaches of the intersection (in the direction of the crossing) are high: in the peak hours an average of about 650 motor vehicles per hour per approach. The volumes in the peak hours are close to the maximum capacity of the intersection. The traffic volumes on the minor approaches are considerably lower with a daytime average of about 160 motor vehicles per hour per approach. The ratio between traffic on the minor and major approaches is around 0. 25. This is more favourable for road safety than a more equal distribution. Generally, the bicycle volumes are below 100 bicycles per hour (also during the peak hours) with the exception of the southern branch of the N 233 in the morning peak (about 150 bicycles per hour). According to CROW standards bicycle volumes are considered relatively low, also during rush hours. Camera footage shows that in the current situation both cyclists and motor vehicles often ignore the red signal: on average one vehicle (cyclist or motor vehicle) per 34 minutes. Other offences were not as frequently observed at the current intersection. Illegal or incorrect overtaking, merging by motor vehicles and transverse crossing by cyclists sporadically occur. No bicycle-bicycle conflicts were observed, and neither were dangerous situations between buses and other traffic. The proportion of freight traffic on the N 233 is between 5 % and 10 % and is low to normal in comparison with general volumes on similar provincial distributor roads. The average speed of motorized traffic on the N 233 varies between 48 km/h and 74 km/h. The speed driven by 85 % of the traffic, the so-called V 85, varies between 65 km/h and 87 km/h. The average speed of the freight traffic is lower and the V 85 of freight traffic does not exceed 80 km/h. The speed of cyclists on the Bergweg-West (downhill towards the junction with the N 233) is about 23 km/h, which is higher than what CROW considers to be 'normal' (15 - 20 km/h). Assessment design proposals In general the design of a signalized intersection as proposed by the province meets the current design requirements for an intersection between a distributor road and an access road in rural areas. However, the proposed design can be improved. Due to the large speed differences (mainly between motorized traffic and cyclists/pedestrians) at the intersection, speed-reducing measures (such as a raised junction or speed humps on the approaches) are recommended. The speeds on the intersection should be limited to a maximum of 50 km/h. Enforcement using recognizable red light and speed cameras (set to a limit of 50 km/h) remains important. It is recommended that these camera’s cover both approaches of the N 233; currently there is only one camera. The Bergweg-West is a 50 km/h distributor road and should have separate cycle paths. The detailed design should take into account a higher design speed for cyclists than the speed that is normally common for solitary moped/bicycle paths. This is especially the case for the downhill stretch towards the intersection with the N 233. The bicycle facilities at the intersection should have an immediate connection with the bicycle facilities of the adjacent road section Bergweg-West. The proximity of the T-junction with Bergweg-East can lead to confusing traffic situations, especially for cyclists that use the Bergweg. The construction of a threshold treatment, a raised cycle path or even a raised junction should be considered. The sketch design of WWVO offers a grade-separated solution with a 3 -arm roundabout. This proposal provides no insight into the layout of the intersections, the alignment and cross-sectional profile, and therefore this proposal was assessed at a sketch plan level. In the WWVO-design the traffic to and from Achterbergsestraatweg and Bergweg-East is redirected to a grade-separated intersection to the south of the current intersection. Bicycle traffic from the part of Rhenen situated at the southeast of the intersection, gets a new bicycle connection between the Boslandweg and Bergweg-West. For these cyclists this connection is shorter, more direct and, because of the grade-separated junction with the N 233, safer than the current connection. The current intersection is converted to a 3 -arm roundabout. This alternative offers a solution for a number of potential road safety problems on the intersection (especially lateral conflicts with intersecting traffic) but at the same time introduces new problems. For traffic from Achterberg this solution causes detours, whereby both cyclists and motorized traffic need to use a longer, indirect connection (a detour of about 400 metres). By diverting the traffic, the traffic volume on the Achterbergsestraatweg-West increases. This longer travel distance on an unsafer road type has negative road safety consequences. In this design, the road sections and intersections of the connections should be constructed in accordance with Sustainable Safety requirements. It must be investigated whether this solution is acceptable for the current road users. At locations where large volumes of slow traffic (for example, a main cycle route) cross a busy distributor road, it is advisable to construct a grade-separated bicycle or pedestrian bridge or tunnel. However, these are not evident at the intersection between the N 233 and the Bergweg/ Achterbergsestraatweg. The road crash details (based on old data from 2001 to 2009) are slightly alarming, but not due to crashes involving vulnerable road users. Conflict-observations in the current situation do not present an alarming picture either. Therefore, a grade-separated solution does not seem warranted. Even with an increase in bicycle traffic, a grade-separated solution does not seem to be appropriate. Given the outcome of the survey, an increase in bicycle traffic is not likely and the number of cyclists will remain about the same, even with a new grade-separated bridge. Finally Due to high traffic volumes and large differences in speed, direction and mass, intersections and interchanges on through roads (always) have a grade-separated construction. Also within Sustainable Safety a grade-separated intersection is a unique predictability characteristic of a through road. Intersections on distributor roads (such as the N 233) are generally at grade. At locations where large numbers of slow traffic (e. g. a main cycle route) cross a busy distributor road, it is recommended to construct a grade-separated bicycle or pedestrian bridge or tunnel. In the situation that was investigated here, large numbers of cyclists and pedestrians were not observed. Even taking into account an unlikely modal shift from the current supervised trip to school (mainly by car) to a future independent journey to school by bicycle, (such as the results of the survey suggest), volumes would still not warrant grade separation. A very common solution for this type of situation is an at-grade intersection, supported with median islands, speed reducing measures and, if necessary, a signalized intersection. A starting point of Sustainable Safety and the CROW Road Design Manual is that roundabouts are preferable at 4 -arm intersections between 80 km/h distributor roads and 60 km/h access roads. However, this is subject to local conditions (capacity, space, integration and so on). If a roundabout is not feasible and traffic volumes allow it, a priority controlled intersection is the correct solution. If a roundabout is not feasible and traffic volumes are high, a signal controlled intersection is preferred, preferably in combination with speed reducing measures. The findings of the present study provide no reason to deviate from the CROW and SWOV-recommendations for intersections on rural distributor roads. The study takes into account the current and future traffic volumes on the intersection between the N 233 and the Bergweg/Achterbergsestraatweg (including the relatively limited number of cyclists), the current level of road safety and the road safety level experienced by residents. To a large extent concurring with the plans of the Province, we recommend signal control with improved capacity and speed control measures for this intersection. This does justice to local environmental factors and to traffic and road safety elements. It is however recommended to monitor road safety and traffic behaviour on and near the intersection after the reconstruction. Furthermore, the main branches of the intersection must be equipped with speed-reducing facilities, supported by red light/speed camera's that are set to a limit of 50 km/h. The design should pay special attention to crossing cyclists, so that these are protected against conflicts with fast traffic both in time and in space. The Bergweg-West is a 50 km/h distributor road and should have separate cycle paths. For this approach (especially the downhill section in the direction of the N 233) the higher speeds of cyclists should be taken into account in the detailed design. The bicycle facilities at the intersection must have a direct connection to the bicycle facilities of the adjoining road sections; this connection is now absent on the western branch. The proximity of the <b>T-connection</b> with the Bergweg-East can lead to confusing traffic situations, especially for cyclists that use the Bergweg. A solution in the form of a threshold construction, a raised bicycle path, or even a raised junction should be considered. The current number and type of crashes, the traffic situation (including conflicts) and the future traffic situation (especially the numbers of cyclists) at the intersection do not give rise to considering the construction of a grade-separated (bicycle or pedestrian) bridge or tunnel. This is subject to the condition that the above design improvements for the at-grade solution are applied...|$|E
