Other industry consultants have disagreed with the assessment, believing that <b>the</b> <b>move</b> is timely because the company is growing with its aging customer base.|$|E

5|$|Exceptions {{to these}} naming {{patterns}} {{are found in}} languages that designate <b>the</b> <b>move</b> by making reference to a location, such as the Norwegian brassespark (Brazilian kick).

5|$|However, the {{rebellion}} of Justo José de Urquiza against Rosas in 1851, Rosas' defeat {{at the battle}} of Caseros and the resulting chaos delayed <b>the</b> <b>move</b> of San Martín's remains to Buenos Aires.

For example, if this limit were three minutes, <b>the</b> <b>moves</b> of <b>the</b> Automaton might be made at any given intervals longer than three minutes.

5|$|Male masked shrikes sing from perches {{in their}} territories from early April, {{sometimes}} chasing or competing vocally with neighbouring males. The male's courtship display, usually accompanied by singing, {{starts with the}} bird perching erect and shivering its wings on an exposed perch, and {{is followed by the}} shrike stepping down its branch and bowing, either on <b>the</b> <b>move</b> or while temporarily halted. The male may also give a fluttering, zigzagging flight display. The female is sometimes fed by her mate while she crouches with spread wings and gives begging calls. Elements of the display are shared with other shrikes, but stepping-down and bowing on <b>the</b> <b>move</b> appear to be confined to this species.|$|E

2500|$|Using {{personal}} finances, John Devitt founded Vietnam Combat Veterans, Ltd. With {{the help}} of friends, the half-size replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, named <b>The</b> <b>Moving</b> Wall, was built and first put on display {{to the public in}} Tyler, Texas, in 1984. <b>The</b> <b>Moving</b> Wall visits hundreds of small towns and cities throughout the U.S., staying five or six days at each site. Local arrangements for each visit are made months in advance by veterans' organizations and other civic groups. Desire for a hometown visit of <b>The</b> <b>Moving</b> Wall was so high that the waiting list became very long. Vietnam Combat Veterans built a second structure of <b>The</b> <b>Moving</b> Wall. A third structure was added in 1989. In 2001, one of the structures was retired due to wear. By 2006, there had been more than 1,000 hometown visits of <b>The</b> <b>Moving</b> Wall. <b>The</b> count of people who visited <b>The</b> <b>Moving</b> Wall at each display ranges from 5,000 to more than 50,000; the total estimate of visitors is in the tens of millions. As <b>the</b> wall <b>moves</b> from town to town on interstates, it is often escorted by state troopers and up to thousands of local citizens on motorcycles. Many of these are Patriot Guard Riders, who consider escorting <b>The</b> <b>Moving</b> Wall to be a [...] "special mission", which is coordinated on their website. As it passes towns, even when it is not planning a stop in those towns, local veterans organizations sometimes plan for local citizens to gather by the highway and across overpasses to wave flags and salute the Wall.|$|R
