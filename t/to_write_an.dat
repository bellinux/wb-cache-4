While musical ideas for such a work predated 1877, now they came with greater persistence. By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in earnest, and he finished the opera by early November.|$|E

5|$|Angelou was {{challenged}} by her friend, author James Baldwin, and her editor, Robert Loomis, <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>an</b> autobiography {{that was also}} a piece of literature.

The book covers topics common to autobiographies written by Black American women {{in the years following}} the Civil Rights Movement: a celebration of Black motherhood; a critique of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition.|$|E

His decision <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>an</b> accessible book on animal coloration falls into this pattern. Beddard wrote Animal Coloration {{at a time}} when scientists' confidence in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was at a low ebb. Beddard's book was part of an ongoing debate among zoologists about how far natural selection affected animals, and how far other forces – such as the direct action of light – might be the causes of observed features such as the colours of animals. Edward Bagnall Poulton's far more strongly pro-Darwinian book The Colours of Animals had appeared just two years earlier in 1890.|$|E
