5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of September 2 Schmitt radioed 1st Battalion for an airdrop of supplies. A US plane attempted the drop, but the perimeter was so small and the slopes so steep <b>that</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>all</b> the supplies went into North Korean hands. The men in the perimeter did, however, recover from a drop made later at 19:00 some supplies and ammunition. Private First Class Joseph R. Ouellette, of H Company, left the perimeter to gather weapons, ammunition, and grenades from the North Korean dead. On several occasions he was attacked, and on one such occasion a North Korean soldier suddenly attacked Ouellette, who killed the North Korean in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} {{which had}} plagued Honiara and the islands {{since the late}} 1990s had a devastating impact on the economy {{due to the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>all</b> tourist organisations around the world specifically warned tourists wishing to visit the islands to stay away, especially in 2002 and 2003 {{at the peak of the}} troubles. In 1998, the country earned around $13million from tourism and just $629,000 in 1999, equating to an average spend per visit of only US$254 (about US$35/day). In 1999, tourism in the city and nation accounted for just 4.38% of the total GDP.|$|E

5|$|His view (part of a {{tradition}} {{that goes back to}} J. J. Müller, who advanced Marius' claims as early as 1870, and supported by modern scholars such as André Chastagnol) was vigorously contested by Ronald Syme, who theorized <b>that</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>all</b> the identifiable citations from Marius Maximus are essentially frivolous interpolations into the main narrative source, which he postulated was a different Latin author whom he styled 'Ignotus ("the unknown one"), the good biographer'. His theory argued, firstly, that as Marius wrote a sequel to the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, his work covered the reigns from Nerva to Elagabalus; consequently, this would not have included a biography of Lucius Verus, even though the biography of that Princeps in the History is mainly of good quality. Secondly, that 'Ignotus' only went up to Caracalla, as is revealed by the inferior and mostly fictitious biography of Macrinus. Finally, that the composer of the Historia Augusta wrote the lives of the emperors through to the Life of Caracalla (including Lucius Verus) using Ignotus as his main source, and supplementing with Marius Maximus on occasion. It was only when the source failed that he turned to other less reliable sources (such as Herodian and Maximus), as well as his own fertile imagination, and it was at this juncture that he composed the first five minor lives, through to the Life of Geta.|$|E

25|$|The {{third was}} {{the murder of}} William Donn de Burgh, 3rd Earl of Ulster in June 1333. This {{resulted}} in his lands being split in three among his relations, with the ones in Connacht starting the Burke Civil War, rebelling against the Crown and becoming new Irish clans. This meant <b>that</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>all</b> of Ireland west of the Shannon was lost to the Dublin administration. It would be well over two hundred years before the McWilliam Burkes, as they were now called, were again allied with the Dublin administration. In Ulster the O'Neill dynasty took over and renamed Clandeboye in the earldom's lands in County Down, and in 1364 they assumed the title King of Ulster.|$|E

25|$|To this day, WHSV is {{the only}} full-power {{commercial}} station in the Shenandoah Valley.

25|$|In the 19th {{century the}} Scottish {{physicist}} James Clerk Maxwell {{found a new}} way of explaining colours, by the wavelength of their light.

His idea, called additive colour or the RGB colour model, is used today to create colours on televisions and computer screens. The screen is covered by tiny pixels, each with three fluorescent elements for creating red, green and blue light. If the red, blue and green elements all glow at once, the pixel looks white. As the screen is scanned from behind with electrons, each pixel creates its own designated colour, composing a complete picture on the screen.|$|E

25|$|Adding to his {{reputation}} {{was the fact}} that Liszt gave away much of his proceeds to charity and humanitarian causes. In fact, Liszt had made so much money by his mid-forties <b>that</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>all</b> his performing fees after 1857 went to charity. While his work for the Beethoven monument and the Hungarian National School of Music are well known, he also gave generously to the building fund of Cologne Cathedral, the establishment of a Gymnasium at Dortmund, and the construction of the Leopold Church in Pest. There were also private donations to hospitals, schools and charitable organizations such as the Leipzig Musicians Pension Fund. When he found out about the Great Fire of Hamburg, which raged for three days during May 1842 and destroyed much of the city, he gave concerts in aid of the thousands of homeless there.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, by 823, Niu Sengru {{was serving}} as the deputy {{minister}} of census (戶部侍郎, Hubu Shilang), and was much respected by Emperor Muzong. After {{the death of the}} military governor-turned-chancellor Han Hong, Emperor Muzong discovered <b>that</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>all</b> the officials in the imperial administration had received bribes from Han, who wanted to ingratiate them, but that Niu had refused the bribe.

At that time, Li Deyu, who had become the governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) of Zhexi Circuit (浙西, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), was considered a potential chancellor candidate as well, and as he was passed over in this selection and would eventually not be promoted for a stretch of eight years. He came to believe that it was the chancellor Li Fengji (who was later considered a Niu-party leader as well) who recommended Niu for chancellorship in order to reject him. He thus resented Niu and Li Fengji even more.|$|E
25|$|In Egypt, Mamluk {{centralization}} over {{agricultural production}} was more thorough than in Syria and Palestine {{for a number}} of reasons. Among them was <b>that</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>all</b> agriculture in Egypt depended on an irrigation single source, the Nile, and the measures and rights to irrigation were determined by the river's flooding, whereas in Syria and Palestine, there were multiple sources of mostly rain-fed irrigation, and measures and rights were thus determined at the local level. Centralization over Syria and Palestine was also more complicated than in Egypt due to the diversity of those regions' geography and the frequent invasions of the Syro-Palestinian territories. The state's role in Syro-Palestinian agriculture was restricted to the fiscal administration and to the irrigation networks and other aspects of rural infrastructure. Although the level of centralization not as high as in Egypt, the Mamluks did impose enough control over the Syrian economy to derive revenues from Syria that benefited the sultanate and contributed to the defense of its realm. Furthermore, the maintenance of the Mamluk army in Syria relied on the state's control over Syrian agricultural revenues.|$|E
