5|$|Initially it {{was planned}} to use the Sd.Kfz. 10 as a <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> for various light guns and trailers, but it was {{authorized}} {{as a substitute for}} the Sd.Kfz. 250 light armored personnel carrier in 1939. The Ausf. B model saw its use broadened to tow heavier weapons like the 5 cm PaK 38 as well as their ammunition trailers. They also served in the maintenance and supply companies of motorized and tank units. Nine were delivered to Romania in 1942 as tractors for anti-tank guns.|$|E
5|$|Campervans, caravans and trailer tents are {{not allowed}} into the main festival site. However, the {{purchase}} of a campervan ticket in addition to the main ticket allows access to fields just outside the boundary fence; and the cost includes access for the campervan or <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> and the caravan; the car, or other vehicle used to tow the caravan, may be parked alongside it but sleeping is only authorised in the campervan/caravan and connected awning, not in the accompanying vehicle. One additional tent may accompany the caravan/campervan if space within the plot allows. Some people choose to bring or hire a motorhome, though drivers of larger vehicles or motorhomes may have to purchase a second campervan ticket if they cannot fit within the defined plot. The 2009 festival saw changes to the campervan fields; commercial vehicles were no longer classed as 'campervans', all campervans had to have a fitted sleeping area and either washing or cooking facilities, and caravans and trailer tents were allowed back at the festival. Prior to this only campervans were allowed on site, caravans and trailers being banned in the early 1990s after a number were stuck in the mud and abandoned.|$|E

5000|$|A weight-distributing hitch is a [...] "load leveling" [...] hitch. It is a hitch setup {{mounted on}} the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle</b> that uses spring bars and chains under tension to {{distribute}} part of the trailer's hitch weight from the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle's</b> rear axle to the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle's</b> front axle and to the trailer's axle(s). It can help reduce trailer sway and hop. Trailer hop can jerk the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Trailer sway is sometimes called [...] "fish tailing". At high speeds, trailer sway can become dangerous. Most vehicle manufacturers will only allow a maximum trailer capacity of 5000 lb and 500 lb of tongue weight without using a weight-distributing hitch. <b>Tow</b> <b>vehicles</b> often have square receiver sockets to accept weight distributing hitches.|$|R

25|$|The {{fifth wheel}} {{coupling}} provides a pivoting link between a semi-trailer and the towing truck, tractor unit, leading trailer or dolly. Some recreational vehicles have a fifth wheel configuration, requiring the coupling to be installed {{in the bed of}} a pickup truck as a <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The coupling consists of a coupling pin (or kingpin) {{on the front of the}} semi-trailer, and a horseshoe-shaped coupling device called a fifth wheel on the rear of the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle.</b> In 1911, Charles Martin invented the fifth wheel coupler consisting of a round plate with a hole in it, attached to a frame mounted on his tractor.|$|E
25|$|Like {{sailplanes}} {{and hang}} gliders, paragliders use rising air (thermals) or ridge lift to gain height. This {{process is the}} basis for most recreational flights and competitions, though aerobatics and 'spot landing competitions' also occur. Launching is often done by jogging down a slope, but winch launches behind a <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> are also used. A Paramotor is a paraglider wing powered by a motor attached {{to the back of the}} pilot, and is also known as a powered paragliders. A variation of this is the paraplane, which has a motor mounted on a wheeled frame rather than the pilot's back.|$|E
25|$|Nemkov {{fought in}} combat from September 1941. In 1943, he {{graduated}} from the commanders' courses. He became a company commander in the 118th Guards Rifle Regiment of the 37th Guards Rifle Division. During Operation Bagration, Nemkov's company reportedly advanced 300 kilometers. On 25 August, his company was reportedly first to break into German trenches during the battle for the village of Zalye. The company reportedly killed 20 German soldiers. While pursuing retreating German troops, Nemkov's company reportedly recaptured one <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> and two mortars. They also captured the village of Lysaya-Gura and cut the Moscow-Warsaw highway. During the fighting for Brok on 27 August, Nemkov's company was again first to enter and cut the German retreat route. In this action, they reportedly killed 25 German soldiers. While in battle on 30 August near Poręba, Nemkov's company reportedly killed up to 18 German soldiers. He was lightly wounded in the leg but reportedly did not leave the front and continued to command. During a later action on the western bank of the Narew, Nemkov's company {{was among the first to}} attack and capture three German trehcnes in the village of Lubeneu. They also reportedly killed up to 15 German soldiers and captured 5 mortars, as well as one <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle.</b> By September 1944, he had reportedly killed ten German soldiers during the offensive. He had also been wounded twice. On 23 October 1944, he was awarded the Order of the Red Star for his actions during the offensive. Nemkov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on the next day for his leadership during the fighting at Zalye, Brok, Poreba and the western bank of the Narew.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} factor in towing safety is tongue weight, the weight with which the trailer presses down on the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle's</b> hitch. Insufficient tongue weight can cause the trailer to sway back and forth when towed. Too much tongue weight can cause problems with the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{rules on}} what a driver can tow are {{different}} depending on when they passed their driving test. If they passed their car driving test on or after 1 January 1997, they may drive a car or van up to 3,500kg maximum authorised mass (MAM) towing a trailer of up to 750kg MAM, and they may tow a trailer over 750kg MAM {{as long as the}} combined MAM of the trailer and <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> is no more than 3,500kg MAM when loaded. They must pass the car and trailer driving test to tow anything heavier. If a driver passed their car test before 1 January 1997, they are usually allowed to drive a vehicle and trailer combination up to 8,250kg MAM. They are also allowed to drive a minibus with a trailer over 750kg MAM.|$|E
500|$|Preliminary {{design of}} all the German half-tracks of {{the early part of}} the war was done by Dipl.Ing. Ernst Kniepkamp of the Military Automotive Department (Wa Prüf 6) before the Nazis took power in 1933. His designs were then turned over to {{commercial}} firms for development and testing. Demag was assigned to develop the [...] "Liliput" [...] Kleinster geländegängiger Kettenschlepper (smallest cross-country tracked <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle)</b> with the first D ll 1 prototype produced in 1934.

It weighed [...]|$|E
500|$|While {{the first}} two {{vehicles}} were only automotive prototypes, the [...] D ll 3 had a [...] BMW Type 316 engine mounted in the front, 5 roadwheels and a troop compartment that could fit six. The D 4 prototype never left the drawing board. There was no D 5. It was succeeded by eight trial series (Versuchs-Serie) D 6 prototypes in 1937. This weighed , had a [...] Maybach NL 38 TRK engine and a different transmission, but otherwise differed only in detail from the D ll 3. Several D 6s and the D ll 3 were used as prototypes for the models intended for service with the Chemical Troops (Nebeltruppen) and the Air Defense Troops (Luftschutztruppen). A series of 60 pre-production (0-serie) D 6s were ordered in 1937 from Demag, Adler and Mechanische Werke Cottbus (MWC) which differed only in details from the trial series. They were all delivered by November 1938. On 17 March 1937 the vehicle was renamed as the leichter Zugkraftwagen 1 to (Sd.Kfz. 10) (light 1 ton semi-tracked <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle).</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Haubitze M1 {{was best}} {{described}} as an enlarged 24 cm Kanone 3. It used {{many of the same}} design principles as the smaller weapon including the dual-recoil system and a two-part carriage capable of all-around traverse when mounted on its firing platform. It also disassembled into six loads for transport. The loads were cradle, barrel, top carriage, bottom carriage, front platform and turntable and the rear platform. Each piece on its trailer was towed by a [...] Sd.Kfz. 9 half-track. A seventh half-track towed the gantry crane required to assemble the weapon. The gantry crane (powered by a generator on its <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle)</b> would be erected at the new firing position and would take about two hours to assemble the entire weapon.|$|E
