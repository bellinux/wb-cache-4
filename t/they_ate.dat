5|$|The ancient Peruvian Moche people worshipped {{the sea and}} its animals. Their art often depicts manta rays. Historically, mantas were {{feared for}} their size and power. Sailors {{believed}} that <b>they</b> <b>ate</b> fish and could sink boats by pulling on the anchors. This attitude changed around 1978 when divers around the Gulf of California {{found them to be}} placid and that they could interact with the animals. Several divers photographed themselves with mantas, including Jaws author Peter Benchley.|$|E
5|$|They {{have created}} some dishes and desserts based on {{perfumes}} such as Calvin Klein's Eternity, Carolina Herrera, Lancôme and Bulgari. This {{has resulted in}} a perfume being released by the restaurant itself, called Nuvol de Ilimona. It was based on a dessert served at the restaurant called Lemon Distillation, and was developed to spray as a mist over the diners as <b>they</b> <b>ate</b> the dish. The wine list is split into separate lists for red and white, and is delivered on a trolley to each table.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops {{teeth were}} {{arranged}} in groups called batteries, of 36 to 40 tooth columns, in {{each side of}} each jaw with 3 to 5 stacked teeth per column, {{depending on the size}} of the animal. This gives a range of 432 to 800 teeth, of which only a fraction were in use at any given time (tooth replacement was continuous and occurred throughout the life of the animal). They functioned by shearing in a vertical to near-vertical orientation. The great size and numerous teeth of Triceratops suggests that <b>they</b> <b>ate</b> large volumes of fibrous plant material, with some suggesting palms and cycads, and others suggesting ferns, which then grew in prairies.|$|E

5|$|Not {{much had}} {{changed by the}} 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45am. After a {{prisoner}} count, they moved into the yard until 7:30, when they collected breakfast {{and headed back to}} their cells. The 8:00 bell signaled a parade, and then the start of work, which lasted until 11:15. <b>They</b> <b>ate</b> a meal, locked in their cells until 12:20pm, followed by some time in the yards. At 1:00 there was another parade, and another session of work which lasted to 4:15. Another meal was collected, and prisoners were locked away in their cells overnight. The lights stayed on until 9:30pm. On the weekends the routine featured no work, and included a film played for the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Péron's {{interview}} describes {{some aspects}} of the behaviour of the King Island emu. He writes that the bird was generally solitary but gathered in flocks of ten to twenty at breeding time, then wandered off in pairs. <b>They</b> <b>ate</b> berries, grass and seaweed, and foraged mainly during morning and evening. They were swift runners, but were apparently slower than the mainland birds, due to being fat. They swam well, but only did so when necessary. They reportedly liked the shade of lagoons and the shoreline, rather than open areas. They used a claw on each wing for scratching themselves. If unable to flee from the hunting dogs of the sealers, they would defend themselves by kicking, which could inflict a great deal of harm.|$|E
5|$|Sheila Mae Damude {{and her son}} Darin Jon Damude {{came from}} Saanich, British Columbia, Canada. She was an {{administrator}} at the Pacific Christian School in Victoria, while Darin was a college student. They had come to Thailand on holiday, with Darin flying to Asia first before Sheila met him in Bangkok during spring break. They flew to Phuket on 15 March with Martin (still using his assumed name) who {{was sitting in the}} same row as them. He befriended the two and they checked into Nilly's Marina Inn facing Patong Beach. Martin was given Room 48 and the Damudes were given the adjacent Room 43. The Damudes were not seen again after <b>they</b> <b>ate</b> breakfast the next morning; at about 11a.m. THA (5a.m. UTC), Martin asked the inn's receptionist to switch his room to Room 43, saying that the Damudes had left and that he would pay their bill.|$|E
50|$|Monitos {{del monte}} are {{primarily}} insectivores. <b>They</b> <b>eat</b> insects and other invertebrates they {{find on the}} branches of trees and cracks in bark, but during the summer <b>they</b> <b>eat</b> large quantities of fruit, especially mistletoe fruit.|$|R

5|$|After three days, {{unable to}} persuade {{his men to}} back down, Alexander gave Persians command posts {{in the army and}} conferred Macedonian {{military}} titles upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness, which Alexander accepted, and held a great banquet for several thousand of his men at which he and <b>they</b> <b>ate</b> together. In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, Alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year. Meanwhile, upon his return to Persia, Alexander learned that guards of the tomb of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae had desecrated it, and swiftly executed them. Alexander admired Cyrus the Great, from an early age reading Xenophon's Cyropaedia, which described Cyrus's heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator. During his visit to Pasargadae Alexander ordered his architect Aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of Cyrus' tomb.|$|E
5|$|Lt. Blue and Parrish {{returned}} to Sugar Hollow where Parsons was awaiting them, and Parsons set about locating pine {{from which to}} make torches to light {{their way out of}} the hollow. Parsons carried with him a small hatchet, and began splitting pine in the darkness to fashion a torch. He accidentally struck himself in the knee with his hatchet, and Blue applied a handkerchief to his wound to stop its bleeding. The three men traveled through the dark and rain to the nearby home of Frank Carter, where <b>they</b> <b>ate</b> and dried their clothes by the fire. The following morning, they mounted their horses and traveled to Rev. Harris' home, where Parsons and Blue parted with Parrish. Parsons and Blue continued east over Town Hill and reached George Thompson's residence on the Little Cacapon River, which had risen due to the previous night's rainfall. They remained with Thompson for two days until the river subsided, then traveled to Blue's Gap, where they set up camp. There, Lt. Blue received orders from Col. Angus William McDonald to carry out an expedition for General Stonewall Jackson to ascertain the number of Union Army infantry, cavalry, and artillery present in and around Romney; he was accompanied on this expedition by Col. Parsons' son, Isaac Parsons, Jr., and by W. V. Parsons.|$|E

25|$|The feeding {{habits of}} ornithomimosaurs and oviraptorosaurs are a mystery: {{although}} they {{evolved from a}} predatory theropod lineage, they have small jaws and lack the blade-like teeth of typical predators, {{but there is no}} evidence of their diet or how <b>they</b> <b>ate</b> and digested it.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} Native groups, the Pomo Indian of Northern California relied upon fishing, hunting, and {{gathering}} for their daily food supply. <b>They</b> <b>ate</b> salmon, wild greens, gnats, mushrooms, berries, grasshoppers, rabbits, rats, and squirrels. Acorns {{were the most}} important part of their diet.|$|E

50|$|The diet of the vole varies {{depending}} on its environment.

Small hunting parties of men and teenage boys {{would be sent to}} hunt for small game such as rabbit, gopher, and squirrel. They also hunted large game such as deer, antelope, and mountain lions. When the spring season came, special groups would go close to the Great Plains to hunt for bison.|$|E
25|$|The concheiro {{found in}} the Cividade showed that <b>they</b> <b>ate</b> raw or coocked limpets, mussels and Sea urchins. These species are still broadly common. Fishing must {{not have been a}} regular activity, given the lack of archaeological evidence, but the {{discovery}} of hooks and net weights showed that the Castro people were able to catch fish of considerable size such as grouper and snook.|$|E
25|$|Although bongos {{are quite}} easy {{for humans to}} catch using snares, many people native to the bongos' habitat {{believed}} that if <b>they</b> <b>ate</b> or touched bongo, they would have spasms similar to epileptic seizures. Because of this superstition, bongos were less harmed in their native ranges than expected. However, these taboos are said no longer to exist, which may account for increased hunting by humans in recent times.|$|E

25|$|A Roman villa on the site, {{built around}} the year 200, {{contains}} an elaborate mosaic tile floor in what {{is believed to have}} been a triclinium.

The mosaic features images of Dionysus, god of wine and of socializing, along with Pan and Hercules in several of the 15 panels.|$|E
25|$|The {{religions}} of Chinese Buddhism and Taoism {{require that}} monks and nuns eat an egg free, onion free vegetarian diet. Since abbeys were usually self-sufficient, in practice this meant <b>they</b> <b>ate</b> a vegan diet. Many religious orders also avoid hurting plant life by avoiding root vegetables. This {{is not just}} seen as an ascetic practice, but Chinese spirituality generally believes that animals have immortal souls, and that a diet of mostly grain is the healthiest for humans.|$|E
