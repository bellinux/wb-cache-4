5|$|Patricius {{was praised}} {{in the third}} preface of the Justinian Digest (Tanta-Dedoken) as a {{distinguished}} professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut {{at the turn of}} the 20th century revealed a funerary monument believed to have belonged to Patricius.

Leontius was also involved as a commissioner in the preparation of the first codex of Justinian. His contemporary, Amblichus, wrote a commentary on Ulpian's Libri ad Edictum.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{idea for}} the game was {{inspired}} by , a 2007 video game which members of both companies were playing at the time. The game was proposed to Square Enix half-jokingly by PopCap's chief creative officer Jason Kapalka during a meeting between the two companies in 2007, and was released on the Xbox Live Arcade and on the Steam platform for Windows PCs by Square Enix on November 18, 2009. Gyromancer received a generally positive reception from reviewers. Critics took issue with perceived limited graphics, {{some aspects of the}} music, and a weak and confusing plot. Despite these flaws, in general they found the game to be fun and addictive, and <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> deal of replay value.|$|E

25|$|Lankes {{received}} his first opportunity as an illustrator in the woodcut medium from Max Eastman, who edited The Liberator.

His detention camp was filled with other intellectuals such as Mikel Dufrenne, who organized readings and classes sufficiently rigorous that the camp was accredited as a degree-granting institution by the Vichy government. During that time he read Karl Jaspers, who was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> influence on him. He also began a translation of Edmund Husserl's Ideas I.|$|E

25|$|Crude oil {{and refined}} fuel spills from tanker ship {{accidents}} have damaged vulnerable ecosystems in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico, the Galapagos Islands, France, the Sundarbans, Ogoniland, {{and many other}} places. The quantity of oil spilled during accidents has ranged from a few hundred tons to several hundred thousand tons (e.g., Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, Atlantic Empress, Amoco Cadiz), but volume is a limited barometer of damage or impact. Smaller spills have already proven <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> impact on ecosystems, such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill because of the remoteness of the site or the difficulty of an emergency environmental response.|$|E
25|$|Sponsors and sponsees {{participate}} {{in activities that}} lead to spiritual growth. Experiences in the program are often shared by outgoing members with incoming members. This rotation of experience is often considered <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> spiritual reward. These may include practices such as literature discussion and study, meditation, and writing. Completing the program usually implies competency to guide newcomers which is often encouraged. Sponsees typically do their Fifth Step, review their moral inventory written {{as part of the}} Fourth Step, with their sponsor. The Fifth Step, as well as the Ninth Step, have been compared to confession and penitence. Michel Foucault, a French philosopher, noted such practices produce intrinsic modifications in the person—exonerating, redeeming and purifying them; relieves them of their burden of wrong, liberating them and promising salvation.|$|E
25|$|Red Bull Racing {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> {{season in}} 2010, {{thanks to their}} hiring of designer Adrian Newey in 2007. They won the Constructors' Championship in the penultimate round in Brazil, and Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel won the championship {{in the final round}} of the 2010 season at Abu Dhabi. Mercedes GP (formerly Brawn GP) had a much less successful and winless season than 2009 with their two new drivers – seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher who returned to Formula One, but was regularly beaten by fellow German, Nico Rosberg. McLaren and Ferrari had better seasons in 2010, finishing second and third in the constructors, respectively. The Drivers' Championship was very closely fought, with six men leading the championship at one point, in the joint longest ever (nineteen-race) season. For most of the season, the title looked like it could have gone to either Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel or Mark Webber, or either McLaren's Lewis Hamilton or reigning World Champion Jenson Button (also at McLaren). But, the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso clawed back 47-points after the British Grand Prix, to be leading the Drivers' Championship with two races left. A record four drivers were still in contention for the title going into the final round in Abu Dhabi. They were Alonso, Webber, Vettel and Hamilton (placing in that order in number of points before the race). They did not finish that way though, with Vettel winning the race and the title when the others finished too far down the field. Vettel became the youngest ever World Champion {{in the history of the}} sport.|$|E

500|$|The 1950s saw {{a number}} of brief fads that went on <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> impact on future styles of music. [...] Performers like Pete Seeger and The Weavers popularized a form of old-time revival of Anglo-American music. [...] This field {{eventually}} became associated with the political left-wing and Communism, leading {{to a decline in}} acceptability as artists were increasingly blacklisted and criticized. [...] Nevertheless, this form of pop-folk exerted a profound influence in the form of 1950s folk-rock and related styles. [...] Alongside the rather sporadic success of popularized Anglo folk music came a series of Latin dance fads, including mambo, rumba, chachachá and boogaloo. [...] Though their success was again sporadic and brief, Latin music continued to exert a continuous influence on rock, soul and other styles, as well as eventually evolving into salsa music in the 1970s.|$|E
