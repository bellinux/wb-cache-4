5|$|At the FBI, Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) {{discloses}} {{to a room}} {{of agents}} that Dana Scully’s (Gillian Anderson) son William has been abducted. Follmer notes that The Lone Gunmen are identifying the woman who took the child and ran over John Doggett (Robert Patrick). However, Follmer leaves out any potential motive for these crimes, which causes a frustrated Scully to leave the room. Byers (Bruce Harwood) reveals <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> a cell phone in the baby’s belongings so they can track the Overcoat Woman; Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Scully head out to find William. The two eventually find William's car seat along with the cell phone in an abandoned SUV. Meanwhile, the Overcoat Woman reports to Josepho that she has William.|$|E

As they leave, T-Rick discovers his gnome stolen and chases after them but they escape in Thomas' mini-van. As night falls, the party's start time passes but no one turns up and Thomas worries that the party will fail. Suddenly, party-goers arrive en-masse. Thomas intends to limit the party to the backyard and poolhouse with the house guarded by two young security guards, Everett and Tyler. However, more and more people begin to arrive and the party moves beyond their control and into the house. Thomas questions Costa on how he advertised the party, forcing him to confess <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> ads on Craigslist and on a local radio station, worried that no one would attend.|$|E

5|$|Costello {{picks up}} the trenchcoat and shoots more {{subordinates}} who get in his way. Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> the coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and sees that they align with the bullets stuck in the bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head killing him. Costello is last seen eating and laughing with the woman and children.|$|E
5|$|Fearful of Hereford's power, Richard {{unjustly}} {{orders that}} his cousin be {{banished from the}} realm for six years, {{to the dismay of}} the House of Commons and many others. Slowly dying of old age, Gaunt's final advice to Richard, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> aside his favourites and become a just king, falls on deaf ears. Gaunt dies soon after; Richard becomes increasingly dictatorial and prevents Gaunt's vast inheritance from being granted to Bolingbroke; his banishment is converted to life, though his sons remain in the country. In the wake of these troublesome events, Richard leaves England for Ireland, a decision widely considered folly considering the turmoil England is in. Bolingbroke returns to England and many nobleman flock to his banner; Richard is overthrown.|$|E

5|$|Spanish teacher Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) {{learns that}} Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky), {{the head of}} William McKinley High School's glee club has been fired for {{inappropriate}} sexual behavior toward student Hank Saunders (Ben Bledsoe). The school principal, Figgins (Iqbal Theba), gives Will permission {{to take over the}} club, and he plans to revitalize it, naming the group New Directions. The club consists of fame-hungry Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), diva Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), flamboyant countertenor Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), paraplegic electric guitar player Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) and stuttering goth Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz). Will's efforts are derided by Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), head of the school's successful cheerleading team, the Cheerios, who soon plans to abolish the Glee club to restore her money funded towards the spoiled Cheerios. His wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) is also unsupportive, suggesting that Will become an accountant to increase their income and give up teaching. Rachel threatens to leave the club if Will cannot find a male vocalist with talent comparable to hers. When the school's football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) allows Will to try to recruit football team members, in return <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> a good word for Emma for him (because Ken likes her), he discovers that quarterback Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) is secretly a talented singer. He plants marijuana in Finn's locker, and blackmails him into joining New Directions. Finn, determined not to disappoint his widowed mother, complies.|$|E
5|$|Well {{before the}} American victory at Buena Vista, {{political}} clubs were formed which supported Taylor for President. His support {{was drawn from}} an unusually broad assortment of political bands, including Whigs and Democrats, Northerners and Southerners, allies and opponents of national leaders such as Henry Clay and James K. Polk. By late 1846 Taylor's opposition to a presidential run began to weaken, and {{it became clear that}} his principles more closely resembled Whig orthodoxy. Still, he maintained that he would only accept election as a national, independent figure, rather than a partisan loyalist. Taylor declared, as the 1848 Whig Party convention approached, that he had always been a Whig in principle, but he did consider himself a Jeffersonian-Democrat. Many southerners believed that Taylor supported slavery and its expansion into the new territory absorbed from Mexico, and some were angered when Taylor suggested that if he were elected President he would not veto the Wilmot Proviso, which proposed against such an expansion. This position did not enhance his support from activist antislavery elements in the Northern U.S., as these wanted Taylor to speak out strongly in support of the Proviso, not simply fail to veto it. Most abolitionists did not support Taylor, since he was a slave-owner. Many southerners also knew that Taylor supported states' rights and was opposed to protective tariffs and government spending for internal improvements. The Whigs hoped <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> the federal union of the United States above all else.|$|E

According to property records, the other home does not have a garage or a back patio and is on a land area about half the size of Ryun's. It was assessed in 2006 as worth $528,000, compared to $764,000 for Ryun's home. In contrast, homes across the street from Ryun's were sold for over $900,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{manner of}} Gordon's death is uncertain, {{but it was}} romanticized in a popular {{painting}} by George William Joy – General Gordon's Last Stand (1893, currently in the Leeds City Art Gallery), {{and again in the}} film Khartoum (1966) with Charlton Heston as Gordon. The most popular account of Gordon's death was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> on his ceremonial gold-braided blue uniform of the Governor-General together with the Pasha's red fez and that he went out unarmed except with his rattan cane to be cut down by the Ansar. This account was very popular with the British public as it contained much Christian imagery with Gordon as a Christ-like figure dying passively for the sins of all humanity.|$|E

Later that year, Franklin Reeve married Helen Schmidinger, a Columbia University graduate student. Barbara Pitney Lamb married Tristam B. Johnson, a stockbroker, in 1959. Johnson enrolled Christopher and his brother, Benjamin, in Princeton Country Day School, which later merged with Miss Fine's School for Girls to become the co-educational Princeton Day School. Reeve excelled academically, athletically, and onstage; {{he was on the}} honor roll and played soccer, baseball, tennis, and hockey. The sportsmanship award at Princeton Day School's invitational hockey tournament was named in Reeve's honor.

25|$|Whitehouse {{was educated}} at King Edward VI Grammar School, Nuneaton and at Bristol University and had {{completed}} his studies before turning his full-time attention to cricket, {{though he had}} played second eleven cricket for Warwickshire from 1969. His first-class cricket debut in May 1971 was a minor cricket sensation: opening the batting against the admittedly weak bowling of Oxford University, he scored 173 out of a Warwickshire total of 324, with 38 not out in the second innings. At {{the time it was}} the fourth highest score ever by an English player making his debut. Warwickshire's strong batting line-up was rejigged to accommodate him, initially as a middle-order batsman, later as the opening partner to England Test batsman John Jameson, though it was with Billy Ibadulla <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> on 223 for the first wicket against Nottinghamshire, making 122, his second century, in August 1971.

25|$|Happily for George, {{however, the}} unpopular {{coalition}} would not outlast the year. The Treaty of Paris was signed on 3 September 1783, formally ending the American Revolutionary War. Fox proposed an East India Bill {{to place the}} government of the ailing and oppressive British East India Company, at that time in control of a considerable expanse of India, on a sounder footing with a board of governors responsible to Parliament and more resistant to Crown patronage. It passed the Commons by 153 to 80, but, when the King made it clear that any peer who voted in favour of the bill would be considered a personal enemy of the Crown, the Lords divided against Fox by 95 to 76. George now felt justified in dismissing Fox and North from government and in nominating William Pitt in their place; at twenty-four years of age, the youngest British Prime Minister in history was appointed to office, apparently on the authority of the votes of 19 peers. Fox used his parliamentary majority to oppose Pitt's nomination, and every subsequent measure <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> before the House, until March 1784, when the King dissolved Parliament and, in the following general election, Pitt was returned with a substantial majority.|$|E
