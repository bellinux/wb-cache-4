2500|$|In general, in {{needing to}} run {{simulations}} rather than compute likelihoods, {{it may be}} difficult to make fine-scale inferences on epidemiological parameters, and instead, this work usually focuses on broader questions, testing whether overall genealogical patterns are consistent with one epidemiological model or another. [...] Additionally, simulation-based methods are often used to validate inference results, providing test data where the correct answer is known ahead of time. Because computing likelihoods for genealogical data under complex simulation models has proven difficult, an alternative statistical approach called Approximate Bayesian Computation (<b>ABC)</b> <b>is</b> becoming popular in fitting these simulation models to patterns of genetic variation, following successful application of this approach to bacterial diseases. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> because <b>ABC</b> makes use of easily computable summary statistics to approximate likelihoods, rather than the likelihoods themselves.|$|R
