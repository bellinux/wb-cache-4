5|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} are largely determined by {{activity in the}} area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a region known as the chemoreceptor <b>trigger</b> <b>zone.</b> This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors. Consequently, drugs that activate D2 receptors have a high potential to cause nausea. This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson's disease, {{as well as other}} dopamine agonists such as apomorphine. In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti-nausea drugs.|$|E

25|$|Vomiting {{is due to}} gastric stasis (large volume vomiting, brief nausea {{relieved}} by vomiting, oesophageal reflux, epigastric fullness, early satiation), besides direct action on the chemoreceptor <b>trigger</b> <b>zone</b> of the area postrema, the vomiting centre of the brain. Vomiting can thus be prevented by prokinetic agents (e.g. domperidone or metoclopramide). If vomiting has already started, these drugs need to be administered by a non-oral route (e.g. subcutaneous for metoclopramide, rectally for domperidone).|$|E

Method: The essence {{of this study is}} the stimulation of <b>trigger</b> <b>zones</b> used in the reflex locomotion manually and by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) at a frequency of 30 Hz and 182 Hz. Six probands participated in this experiment. During the manual and TENS stimulation was scanned electrical activity in selected muscles by surface electromyography. First, it was evaluated the order of activation of selected muscles, using "standard timing" analysis by MyoResearch XP Master program.

The pain from ATN is often continuous, and periods of remission are rare. Both TN and ATN can be bilateral, though the character of pain is usually different on the two sides at any one time.|$|R
25|$|Many {{pharmacological}} treatments {{which are}} effective for nausea and vomiting in some medical conditions {{may not be}} effective for motion sickness. For example, metoclopramide and prochlorperazine, although widely used for nausea, are ineffective for motion-sickness prevention and treatment. This {{is due to the}} physiology of the CNS vomiting centre and its inputs from the chemoreceptor <b>trigger</b> <b>zone</b> versus the inner ear. Sedating anti-histamine medications such as promethazine work quite well for motion sickness, although they can cause significant drowsiness.|$|E
25|$|Ondansetron is {{a highly}} {{specific}} and selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with low affinity for dopamine receptors. The 5-HT3 receptors are present both peripherally on vagal nerve terminals and centrally in the chemoreceptor <b>trigger</b> <b>zone</b> of the area postrema. Serotonin is released by the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine in response to chemotherapeutic agents and may stimulate vagal afferents (via 5-HT3 receptors) to initiate the vomiting reflex. It is thought that ondansetron's antiemetic action is mediated mostly via antagonism of vagal afferents with a minor contribution from antagonism of central receptors.|$|E
25|$|If {{irritants}} {{are present}} in the food, the enterochromaffin cells release more serotonin to make the gut move faster, i.e., to cause diarrhea, so the gut is emptied of the noxious substance. If serotonin is released in the blood faster than the platelets can absorb it, the level of free serotonin in the blood is increased. This activates 5-HT3 receptors in the chemoreceptor <b>trigger</b> <b>zone</b> that stimulate vomiting. The enterochromaffin cells not only react to bad food but are also very sensitive to irradiation and cancer chemotherapy. Drugs that block 5HT3 are very effective in controlling the nausea and vomiting produced by cancer treatment, and are considered the gold standard for this purpose.|$|E
40|$|Understanding the biophysical {{properties}} of single neurons {{and how they}} process information is fundamental to understanding how the brain works. However, action potential initiation and the preceding integration of the synaptic signals in neuronal processes of individual cells are complex and difficult to understand {{in the absence of}} detailed, spatially resolved measurements. Multi-site optical recording with voltage-sensitive dyes from individual neurons in situ was used to provide these kinds of measurements. We analysed in detail the pattern of initiation and propagation of spikes evoked synaptically in an identified snail (Helix aspersa) neuron in situ. Two main spike <b>trigger</b> <b>zones</b> were identified. The <b>trigger</b> <b>zones</b> were activated selectively by different sets of synaptic inputs which also produced different spike propagation patterns. Synaptically evoked action potentials did not always invade all parts of the neuron. The conduction of the axonal spike was regularly blocked at particular locations on neuronal processes. The propagating spikes in some axonal branches consistently reversed direction at certain branch points, a phenomenon known as reflection. These experimental results, when linked to a computer model, could allow a new level of analysis of the electrical structure of single neurons...|$|R

Endogenous or exogenous harmful disturbances during this developmental period may lead to the preservation of early cortical circuits, which may act as <b>trigger</b> <b>zones</b> for the initiation of pathophysiological activity...|$|R
25|$|The 5-HT3 receptors {{are present}} in several {{critical}} sites involved in emesis, including vagal afferents, the solitary tract nucleus (STN), and the area postrema itself. Serotonin is released by the enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine in response to chemotherapeutic agents and may stimulate vagal afferents (via 5-HT3 receptors) to initiate the vomiting reflex. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists suppress vomiting and nausea by inhibiting serotonin binding to the 5-HT3 receptors. The highest concentration of 5-HT3 receptors in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) are found in the STN and chemoreceptor <b>trigger</b> <b>zone</b> (CTZ), and 5-HT3 antagonists may also suppress vomiting and nausea by acting at these sites. The 5-HT3 antagonists are greatly selective and have little affinity for other receptors, such as dopamine, histamine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance to nausea occurs within 7–10 days, {{during which}} antiemetics (e.g. low dose {{haloperidol}} once at night) are very effective. Due to severe side effects such as tardive dyskinesia, haloperidol is now rarely used. A related drug, prochlorperazine {{is more often}} used, although it has similar risks. Stronger antiemetics such as ondansetron or tropisetron are sometimes used when nausea is severe or continuous and disturbing, despite their greater cost. A less expensive alternative is dopamine antagonists such as domperidone and metoclopramide. Domperidone does not cross the blood–brain barrier and produce adverse central antidopaminergic effects, but blocks opioid emetic action in the chemoreceptor <b>trigger</b> <b>zone.</b> (The drug is not available in the U.S.) Some antihistamines with anticholinergic properties (e.g. orphenadrine or diphenhydramine) may also be effective. The first-generation antihistamine hydroxyzine is very commonly used, with the added advantages of not causing movement disorders, and also possessing analgesic-sparing properties. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol relieves nausea and vomiting; it also produces analgesia that may allow lower doses of opioids with reduced nausea and vomiting.|$|E

50|$|The more {{expensive}} cymbal pads can swing freely after being hit (only {{rotation of the}} pad is prevented by a special cymbal mount), so they feel more like real cymbals, while the less expensive cymbal pads are not movable and always stay in their fixed position, thus feeling less realistic. Most of the movable pads also feature a third bell <b>zone,</b> which is <b>triggered</b> when hitting the bell area of the cymbal pad. These cymbal pads are called three-way cymbals because of their three <b>trigger</b> <b>zones</b> (bell, bow and edge).|$|R
25|$|There {{is great}} support behind {{the idea of}} the {{thalamus}} affecting mitempfindung. Because of the arrangement of sensory regions in the thalamus, there may be a spread of excitation in this brain region. Studies have shown that the thalamic region dedicated to the trunk is found between the regions supporting sensation from the arms and legs. This supports the finding that <b>trigger</b> <b>zones</b> in the chest area lead to referred sensation in the legs. And since the thalamic region for the face lies in a separate area called the arcuate nucleus, this explains why the face remains unaffected by referred itch.|$|R

40|$|Rainfall-induced shallow {{landslides}} {{are common}} phenomena {{in many parts}} of the world, affecting cultivation and infrastructure and sometimes causing human losses. Assessing the <b>triggering</b> <b>zones</b> of shallow landslides is fundamental for land planning at different scales. This work defines a reliable methodology to extend a slope stability analysis from the site-specific to local scale by using a well-established physically based model (TRIGRS-unsaturated). The model is initially applied to a sample slope and then to the surrounding 13. 4 km 2 area in Oltrepò Pavese (northern Italy). To obtain more reliable input data for the model, long-term hydro-meteorological monitoring has been carried out at the sample slope, which has been assumed to be representative of the study area. Field measurements identified the triggering mechanism of shallow failures and were used to verify the reliability of the model to obtain pore water pressure trends consistent with those measured during the monitoring activity. In this way, more reliable trends have been modelled for past landslide events, such as the April 2009 event that was assumed as a benchmark. The assessment of shallow landslide <b>triggering</b> <b>zones</b> obtained using TRIGRS-unsaturated for the benchmark event appears good for both the monitored slope and the whole study area, with better results when a pedological instead of geological zoning is considered at the regional scale. The sensitivity analyses of the influence of the soil input data show that the mean values of the soil properties give the best results in terms of the ratio between the true positive and false positive rates. The scheme followed in this work allows us to obtain better results in the assessment of shallow landslide triggering areas in terms of the reduction in the overestimation of unstable zones with respect to other distributed models applied in the past...|$|R

50|$|Emesis is {{a defense}} {{mechanism}} {{controlled by the}} area postrema of the medulla oblongata. There are various sources of input to the vomiting center. Receptors {{on the floor of}} the fourth ventricle of the brain represent the chemoreceptor <b>trigger</b> <b>zone.</b> The chemoreceptor <b>trigger</b> <b>zone</b> contains dopamine D2 receptors, serotonin 5-HT3 receptors, opioid receptors, acetylcholine receptors, and receptors for substance P. Stimulation of different receptors are involved in different pathways leading to emesis. In the final common pathway, substance P, which activates the neurokinin-1 receptor, appears to be involved. Additionally, the vagal and enteric nervous system inputs transmit information regarding the state of the gastrointestinal system. Irritation of the GI mucosa by chemotherapy, radiation, distention, or acute infectious gastroenteritis activates the 5-HT3 receptors of these inputs. It is now widely known that cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents cause a detectable increase in blood levels of serotonin (5-HT) and its major metabolite, 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). The presence of these chemicals in the blood activate 5-HT3 receptors in the chemoreceptor <b>trigger</b> <b>zone,</b> in turn releasing substance P, which activates NK1 receptors to cause an emetic response (vomiting).|$|E

25|$|There is an {{untested}} {{hypothesis that}} claims that referred itch uses the spinocervical tract pathway. The cells in this tract {{lie in the}} dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and its axons run in the ipsilateral and dorsolateral quadrant, {{which is consistent with}} observations that stimuli in the trigger points are ipsilateral to the sites of referred sensations. These axons project to the thalamus and midbrain, suggesting that the thalamus is involved in the phenomenon. The cells in this tract are also excited by mechanical stimuli, lending support that this pathway can explain the mechanism of referred itch. Central neuronal damage to this area – either direct or secondary to peripheral nerve damage – makes it an area of focal hyperexcitability or reduced inhibition. This hypothesis {{has been found to be}} unlikely because there would be an expected progression of itches (i.e., from legs to trunk, and from trunk to neck).
