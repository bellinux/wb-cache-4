While the story may not solve oedipal issues or sibling rivalry as Bettelheim believes [...] "Cinderella" [...] does, it suggests the importance of respecting property {{and the consequences of}} just 'trying out' <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not belong to you." ...|$|E

Hsing chooses to live with Yao until midway through her college career, when she moves in with 4-Hiroshi Canaval, whom she marries and by whom she has a child.

On entering college she chooses to pledge chastity rather than let her body's rhythms be controlled by the contraceptive injection. She {{is among those who}} choose to live on Hsin Ti Chiu, along with her son, whom Hiroshi names 6-Canaval Alejo.|$|E

In his anger {{he makes the}} rash oath that the wolf [...] "mot have you all at anis! [...] ". However, the wolf is lying nearby with the fox, and, overhearing it, promises to make him stay true to his word. Eventually the oxen calm down, but {{on the way back}} home the wolf jumps into their path. The wolf asks where the husbandman is driving them, since they are not his, to which he confirms that they are and asks why he is being stopped since he never offended the wolf before. The wolf reminds the husbandman of his earlier declaration, to which he replies that a man may say <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not mean anything. They argue, and the husbandman reproaches the wolf for not having a witness; in response, he produces the fox. The creature takes it upon himself to mediate the dispute, and takes each aside in turn. To the husbandman he says that he would lend his expertise to help him {{were it not for the}} [...] "grit coist and expence" [...] of doing so; the husbandman offers him half a dozen of the fattest hens he has, to which the fox acedes and goes off. To the wolf he says that the husbandman has offered an unparalleled block of cheese in exchange for him dropping the case.|$|E
500|$|In 1872, Hobart ran as a Republican for the New Jersey General Assembly from Passaic County's third {{legislative}} district. [...] He {{was easily}} elected, taking {{nearly two-thirds of}} the vote. [...] The General Assembly was then elected annually and he was successful in winning re-election the following year, although his margin of victory was cut in half. [...] In 1874, still only age30, he was voted Speaker of the Assembly. [...] At the time, it was customary to step down after two terms, and he did so, although Hobart biographer David Magie maintained that he was urged to seek re-election. [...] Instead, he campaigned for the Republican nominee for his seat, who was elected. [...] In 1876, Hobart was nominated for the New Jersey Senate seat for Passaic County. [...] He was elected to a three-year term, and was re-elected in 1879. [...] In 1881 and 1882, he served as President of the state Senate, becoming the first man to lead both houses of the legislature. [...] In 1883, he was the Republican nominee in the election for United States Senate—until 1913, senators were elected by state legislatures. [...] As the Democrats had more legislators, a Republican had no chance of election—the nomination was simply a way of honoring Hobart for his political service. [...] When he was asked his feelings about the nomination, he responded, [...] "I do not worry about <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not come my way." [...] The [...] "complimentary" [...] nomination would prove to be Hobart's only electoral defeat.|$|E

2500|$|Engineering {{is quite}} {{different}} from science. Scientists try to understand nature. Engineers try to make <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not exist in nature. Engineers stress innovation and invention. To embody an invention the engineer must put his idea in concrete terms, and design something that people can use. That something can be a complex system, device, a gadget, a material, a method, a computing program, an innovative experiment, a new solution to a problem, or an improvement on what already exists. Since a design has to be realistic and functional, it must have its geometry, dimensions, and characteristics data defined. [...] In the past engineers working on new designs found {{that they did not have}} all the required information to make design decisions. Most often, they were limited by insufficient scientific knowledge. Thus they studied mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and mechanics. Often they had to add to the sciences relevant to their profession. Thus engineering sciences were born.|$|E
2500|$|... "That faith {{which has}} been {{believed}} everywhere, always, and by all", the faith taught by Jesus to the apostles, given life by the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, and passed down to future generations without additions and without subtractions, is known as Holy Tradition. Holy Tradition does not change in the Orthodox Church because it encompasses those <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not change: {{the nature of the}} one God in Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the history of God's interactions with his peoples, the Law as given to the Israelites, all Christ's teaching as given to the disciples and Jews and recorded in scripture, including the parables, the prophecies, the miracles, and His own example to humanity in His extreme humility. It encompasses also the worship of the church, which grew out of the worship of the synagogue and temple and was extended by Christ at the last supper, and the relationship between God and His people which that worship expresses, which is also evidenced between Christ and his disciples. It includes the authority that Christ bestowed on his disciples when he made them apostles, for the preserving and teaching of the faith, and for governing the organization and conduct of the church (in its administration by bishops).|$|E
2500|$|Harris' {{criticism}} of the gameplay include the [...] "frustrating control, chuggy animation, and levels that just go on far too long." [...] He felt the levels needed more variety, stating that [...] "the missions are dreadfully too long and feature very little change in gameplay regardless of the settings and craft to control." [...] Eduardo Zacarias of GameZone also said the game had poor controls and, like Harris, criticized [...] "the fact that the levels seem to drag on forever". He felt there were [...] "a few <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> keep the game from being a simple shooter in outer space, {{such as the ability}} to zoom through the forests of Endor on a speeder bike," [...] but added that [...] "these are just minor distractions that just hide the fact that this game is just way too repetitive." [...] Zacarias enjoyed the amount of detail in background of locations such as the forests of Endor, but criticized the vehicle graphics for looking like bad imitations. Nintendo Power gave Flight of the Falcon a score of 2.3 out of 5, echoing Harris and Zacarias's {{criticism of}} the length of the levels.

2500|$|Academics such as Diamond (2005) Wirthlin (2009) take {{exception}} {{to the role of}} [...] "hot lesbian" [...] in advertisements, and what has turned lesbianism into a commodity. As Diamond (2005) states, [...] "media representations signal a new appreciation and celebration of women's sexual freedom and diversity. On the other hand this is not necessarily the case...by portraying it as a fashionable 'add on' to otherwise conventional heterosexuality" [...] (p.105). They argue that women view these advertisements and images as a true reflection of {{what it is to be}} lesbian, thus making it much harder for real lesbians to acknowledge their sexuality. Furthermore, Wirthlin (2009) points out that, [...] "In order to resist this we must first recognize the ubiquitous presence of [...] "fad" [...] lesbian images and then problematize their use in popular culture. Next, there needs to be an active resistance against these images through counterculture advertisements and the performative act of resistance, such as through the act of writing as oneself, by utilizing multiple voices and subjectivities" [...] (p.113). In both academics view, lesbian or bi-sexual women must be sure of what media means to them, and call into question <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not appear [...] "authentic". Lesbians must also be educated on the topic of the [...] "hot lesbian", and ensure they do not fall into the [...] "heteronormative appropriation" [...] of advertising's effects.|$|E
