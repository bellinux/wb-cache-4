The MPEG-4 file format specification was created {{on the basis of the}} QuickTime format specification published in 2001. The MP4 (.mp4) file format was published in 2001 as the revision of the MPEG-4 Part 1: Systems specification published in 1999 (ISO/IEC 14496-1:2001). In 2003, the first version of MP4 format was revised and replaced by MPEG-4 Part 14: MP4 file format (ISO/IEC 14496-14:2003). The MP4 file format was generalized into the ISO Base Media File Format ISO/IEC 14496-12:2004, which defines a general structure for <b>time-based</b> <b>media</b> files. It in turn is used as the basis for other multimedia file formats (for example 3GP, Motion JPEG 2000).

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{address some of}} the core issues of this conference through an {{examination}} of storage, pausing, saving and playing with the Nintendo DS. I approach the nature of play on a handheld videogame system as an illuminating case of the tension between <b>time-based</b> storage <b>media</b> and space-based transmission media. Storage and Transmission are intertwined and complicit in {{the ways in which the}} DS is used/played. I argue that we can arrive at a thicker, more adequate description of play by investigating activities that are generally considered to be external to game play, activities including pausing and saving. By engaging with these non-diegetic aspect of the video-game experience we can begin to address the materiality of handheld videogaming systems as objects with which we play with time and space. My hope is that this analysis might also be fruitful for examinations of other media assemblages and situations including texting, mobile email and personal computing, and perhaps as well for older forms of travel-based play and games, such as cards, dice, crosswords and portable board gamesi. I begin with a reading of Nintendo DS play that addresses the space-based nature of medium through a focus on the sociality of the space we create and inhabit through public play. I next focus on a key hardware feature of the DS, its stylus, a feature that resonates with Harold Innis’ “The Bias of Communication, ” and allows us to approach the experience of play through the materiality of the DS/player assemblage. I move then to questions of <b>time-based</b> aspects of <b>media</b> and how we can rethink these issues through a close reading of storage, saving and the protection of play on the DS. Finally I suggest how these perspectives might allow us to ask larger question about the nature of play and the subject who plays, particularly in regard to the nature of experience...|$|R

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} {{across a wide}} range of subfields of urban studies in understanding the role played by location-based social media and the impact of the increasing availability of urban digital data from different sources. The way people experience the city is affected by a complex, dense, and reactive information landscape: the data city presents itself with an unprecedented quantity of information in the form of geo-located comments from Twitter, reviews from Pickles, and check-ins from Foursquare. This fragmented proliferation of information generated by urban inhabitants offers potential benefits both for the research community and urban decision makers, who can use the data to generate broad and analytical visions of the uses of urban space. This book explores and presents methods and tools to collect, analyze, and represent <b>time-based</b> geo-located social <b>media</b> data at the urban scale. The aim is to investigate possible perspectives for the use of these data as a source of knowledge for urban planning, de-sign, and management. We ask whether geo-located social media data can be useful in the creation of indicators of urban life as it is perceived and communicated by city users. In fact, although traditional data collection methods such as surveys, interviews, questionnaires, and, more recently, data harvesting and analysis techniques (e. g., using geographical location data from mo-bile devices) have provided interesting insights into the social life of urban spaces, nowadays, they can be complemented using geo-located social media data. On one side, the book reviews the existing literature, projects, and approaches related to data visualization and the geo-located social mining techniques used to investigate topics of urban interests. On the other side, the book presents the design experiments we conduct-ed in collaboration with urban stakeholders at various levels and in various US and European cities. These case studies document our research activity with geo-located social mining techniques and offer some insights distilled from our experience. As a conclusion, we propose recommendations for the exploitation of geo-located social media data in order to answer hitherto un-solved urban questions and—as such—to generate knowledge for urban planning and management...|$|R
40|$|Multimedia {{has become}} a central fixture in higher {{education}} learning environments. From highly polished video produced for Massive Open Online Courses or the flipped classroom, to the extremely authentic recordings of lectures as they happen in lecture capture environments, instructional content is regularly delivered via video to learners across platforms, devices and contexts. Much different than video-based learning even a decade ago, the instructor is not the sole producer of video in {{the teaching and learning}} enterprise; user-generated content is regularly produced by learners themselves, a task that has been made easier by the prevalence of recording technologies such as cell phone cameras and low-cost video hosting platforms such as YouTube and Vimeo. At a technical level, the creation of educational video content spans both the hardware and software domains. In the past several years, we have seen sustained innovation with the development of new kinds of video sensors, codecs and playback environments. For instance, many researchers have begun to innovate on top of the 3 D mesh mapping provided through Microsoft’s Kinect to provide novel immersive environments. These environments offer increased interactivity in the video stream, allowing for objects to be detected relative to one another easily. Much of the innovation on the software side has taken place in deepening the connection between video artifacts {{and the rest of the}} learning environment. This allows video to be leveraged more holistically, with learners being able to cut, remix, comment on, annotate, reference and republish content. The IEEE International Workshops on Multimedia Technology for E-Learning (MTEL) are held in conjunction with the annually IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM). This workshop series, now entering its ninth year, brings experts together from a variety of fields to share innovations in educational media. Three of the articles in this special issue of Interactive Technology and Smart Education are the revised and significantly enhanced versions of outstanding articles presented at the MTEL 2012 and MTEL 2013 workshops held in Irvine and Anaheim, California, USA. The fourth article is an invited contribution from the Opencast[#fn 1] community, which is made up of scholars, engineers and educational technologists who collaborate to produce open source educational video systems. Of the four articles in this issue, two focus on addressing the need for affordable and robust automated camera tracking systems for lecture recording in academia and present different approaches. The first idea relies on Microsoft’s Kinect technology, while the second solution presents an open source project for the automatic control of pan–tilt–zoom cameras. Both contributions elucidate technical details and present results from field tests and user evaluations, and both provide important contributions in moving lecture capture quality closer to the high-quality video today’s learners expect. The third article in this issue addresses spaced repetition learning games on mobile devices, and provides both a theoretical background for the issue and a prototype application. Early evaluation results and a design consideration discussion help to implement the spaced repetition approach in mobile learning games with a special focus on the stress field between motivation and spaced repetitions. The last article addresses the issue of user-annotation of <b>time-based</b> educational <b>media,</b> and the authors present a requirement analysis along with different didactic use cases in this area. Parts of the use cases are implemented in a prototype that is addressed in the technical section of the article. These four articles represent well the diversity of submissions the MTEL workshop series receives on an annual basis, ranging from hardware implementations to software prototypes and design studies. We look forward to future meetings of the workshop, and know you’ll find the results presented here valuable in understanding the state of the art in research on multimedia technologies for e-learning...|$|R

50|$|Instability {{and change}} are {{inherent}} to these artworks, since artist-selected equipment and technologies fail and become obsolete.

At UCLA, there is an M.A. in Moving Image Archive Studies. The latter three programs deal primarily in archival film preservation, which requires specialized training {{in a variety of}} film stocks. A film preservationist must be knowledgeable about and trained to work with many types of film. In a museum context, the film {{is more likely to be}} consumer sizes like super 8mm and 16mm, not the 35mm that is used in commercial film making, as they are the preferred medium of artist and amateur filmmakers.
