40|$|Permafrost-affected <b>tundra</b> <b>soils</b> are {{significant}} {{sources of the}} climate-relevant trace gas methane (CH 4). The observed accelerated warming of the Arctic will cause a deeper permafrost thawing followed by increased carbon mineralization and CH 4 formation in water saturated <b>tundra</b> <b>soils</b> which might cause a positive feedback to climate change. Aerobic CH 4 oxidation {{is regarded as the}} key process reducing CH 4 emissions from wetlands, but quantification of turnover rates has remained difficult so far. The application of carbon stable isotope fractionation enables the in situ quantification of CH 4 oxidation efficiency in arctic wetland soils. The aim of the current study is to quantify CH 4 oxidation efficiency in permafrost-affected <b>tundra</b> <b>soils</b> in Russia's Lena River Delta based on stable isotope signatures of CH 4. Therefore, depth profiles of CH 4 concentrations and δ 13 CH 4 -signatures were measured and the fractionation factors for the processes of oxidation (α ox) and diffusion (α diff) were determined. Most previous studies employing stable isotope fractionation for the quantification of CH 4 oxidation in soils of other habitats (e. g. landfill cover soils) have assumed a gas transport dominated by advection (α trans = 1). In <b>tundra</b> <b>soils,</b> however, diffusion is the main gas transport mechanism, aside from ebullition. Hence, diffusive stable isotope fractionation has to be considered. For the first time, the stable isotope fractionation of CH 4 diffusion through water-saturated soils was determined with an α diff = 1. 001 ± 0. 000 (n = 3). CH 4 stable isotope fractionation during diffusion through air-filled pores of the investigated polygonal <b>tundra</b> <b>soils</b> was α diff = 1. 013 ± 0. 003 (n = 18). Furthermore, it was found that α ox differs widely between sites and horizons (mean α ox, = 1. 017 ± 0. 009) and needs to be determined individually. The impact of both fractionation factors on the quantification of CH 4 oxidation was analyzed by considering both the potential diffusion rate under saturated and unsaturated conditions and potential oxidation rates. For a submerged organic rich soil, the data indicate a CH 4 oxidation efficiency of 50 % at the anaerobic-aerobic interface in the upper horizon. The improved in situ quantification of CH 4 oxidation in wetlands enables a better assessment of current and potential CH 4 sources and sinks in permafrost affected ecosystems and their potential strengths in response to global warming...|$|R

Before leaf-out, soil respiration was depleted in  14 C relative to atmospheric CO 2, root and microbial respiration within the topsoil, demonstrating a substantial contribution of C fixed before 1950. As the growing season progressed, the contribution of older C pools decreased, but remained apparent in the soil respiration from ridges and in pore space CO 2. Soil respiration from troughs became dominated by recently fixed C. As the active layer deepens with permafrost thaw, buried C may become an increasingly larger component of soil respiration.

Changes in water chemistry and stable isotope composition from three streams in west Spitsbergen were examined to assess the sources and losses of nitrogen, sulfur and carbon in thin organic <b>tundra</b> <b>soils</b> overlying sediments. Studies were undertaken from snowmelt (mid June) {{through to the end}} of the summer (September) in both 2001 and 2002. Drainage water chemistry was dominated by the solution of Ca–Mg carbonates with δ 13 C values in the waters being uncharacteristically high (approx. − 2 ‰ at the end of the season), reflecting a largely open system in which the CO 2 is derived equally from the atmosphere and plant/soil sources. Early melt waters had δ 34 S values dominated by sea salt reflecting the close proximity to the ocean. However, as the season progressed the marine influence lessened. Extrapolation of the data suggests that the origin of non-sea salt δ 34 S was the oxidation of reduced sulfur from coal particles in the subsoil. Concentrations of inorganic N in stream waters were generally very low. However, values were found to increase as the season progressed, possibly through increased microbial activity in the soil and the early senescence of tundra plants reducing demand. Dual isotope analysis of δ 15 N and δ 18 O suggested that the vast majority of snow-pack was assimilated by the soil microbial biomass before being released, recycled and lost to drainage waters. Organic N concentrations in drainage waters were generally equal to or greater than losses of inorganic N from <b>tundra</b> <b>soils.</b> The study demonstrated the effectiveness of stable isotope data for understanding biogeochemical cycling and soil–water {{interactions in}} tundra ecosystems.

We examined mineralization of radiolabeled hydrocarbons in microcosms containing soils collected from sites across the Canadian Arctic. The soils all contained psychrotolerant microorganisms which mineralized dodecane and substantially removed total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) at 78 C. Dodecane mineralization was severely limited by both N and P. Dodecane mineralization kinetics varied greatly among dierent soils. Multiple regression analysis showed that soil N and TPH concentrations together accounted for 73 % of the variability of the lag time preceding dodecane mineralization. Soil characteristics were less eective as predictors of mineralization kinetic parameters other than lag time. High total C concentrations were associated with high mineralization rate constants, and high sand contents were associated with long times for half-maximal dodecane mineralization. Very high concentrations of TPH (100 mg gÿ 1 of dry soil) and heavy metals (e. g., 1. 4 mg Pb gÿ 1 of dry soil) did not prevent dodecane mineralization. Inoculation of soils with indigenous or non-indigenous hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms stimulated dodecane mineralization.

The aim {{of this research was}} to compare the impact of climate, vegetation cover, and soil organic matter (SOM) chemistry on N mineralization rates at the forest-tundra ecotone. We therefore estimated N mineralization in mountain birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh. ssp. czerepanovii) forest and <b>tundra</b> <b>soil</b> across a broad-scale latitudinal gradient in Fennoscandia, which incorporated 4 research sites (Dovrefjell, Vassijaure, Abisko, and Joatka). During the summer period, ammonium was the dominant form of mineralized nitrogen in forest soils, while nitrate mineralization rates were higher at tundra sites during the winter. A negative regression relationship between an index of climatic continentality and N mineralization was found. Further, summer NH 4 + mineralization rates increased with total N content in soils, while NO 3 - mineralization seemed to be associated with C availability. Our study showed markedly contrasting inorganic N release in forest and <b>tundra</b> <b>soil,</b> and that, although mineralization rates differed between the summer and winter period, the winter activity was relatively high and should not be ignored.

40|$|The consortia of {{microorganisms}} {{responsible for the}} hydrolysis of cellulose in situ are at present poorly characterized.

The metabolic capacities of these organisms is particularly alarming considering the volume of biomass that is projected to re-enter the carbon cycle in Arctic <b>tundra</b> <b>soil</b> environments {{as a result of a}} warming climate. Novel cold-adapted cellulase enzymes also present enormous opportunities for a broad range of industries. DNA stable-isotope probing (DNA-SIP) is a powerful tool for linking the phylogenetic identity and function of cellulolytic microorganisms by the incorporation of isotopically labelled substrate into nucleic acids. By providing 13 C-enriched glucose and cellulose to soil microcosms, it was possible to characterize the communities {{of microorganisms}} involved in the metabolism of these substrates in an Arctic <b>tundra</b> <b>soil</b> sample from Resolute Bay, Canada. A protocol for generating 13 C-enriched cellulose was developed as part of this thesis, and a visual DNA-SIP protocol was generated to demonstrate the experimental outline.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{emission}} of CO 2 from northeastern Siberian soil was estimated {{for the period}} December 1989 to February 1990. Concentrations of air CO 2 near the ground and 1 m above the snow cover were measured by an infrared gas analyzer. Fluxes of CO 2 across the snow cover were calculated from the differences of these two values and the predetermined CO 2 transfer coefficients at various flux rates through a layer of snow. Temperature and moisture content of the soil profiles were also observed simultaneously. The average transfer coefficient of CO 2 for packed snow measured {{in the winter of}} 1989 / 90 was about 0. 28 cm 2 *s- 1. This value was used to estimate the average CO 2 flux from soil: 0. 26 g Cm- 2. day- 1 in December 1989, 0. 13 g Cm- 2. day- 1 in January 1990 and 0. 07 g C*m- 2 *day- 1 in February 1990. Thus a minimal total of about 13. 8 g Cm- 2 had been released from the <b>tundra</b> <b>soil</b> during the 90 days from December 1989 to February 1990. Using the study by Kelley et al. (1968) and assuming that the minimal CO 2 transfer coefficient is also applicable for the entire tundra and Northern Taiga zones between September and June, the total emission from this region would amount to 0. 23 X loL 5 g of carbon. The main source of this CO 2 probably originated from microbial oxidation of soil organic matter. This assertion is supported by the existence of a relatively warm layer in the frozen soil at 40 - 120 cm depth. This warm layer was about 10 - 40 °C higher than the ambient air, or about 5 - 10 °C higher than the soil surface, and its moisture content was also higher than the surrounding layers.

40|$|The arctic is {{currently}} an important store of terrestrial carbon, but {{may become a}} net source of carbon to {{the atmosphere in the}} future in response to climate change. However, the intricacies of how the carbon cycle is likely to respond to predicted changes are unclear, as soil organic carbon (SOC) is a mixture of many different pools and compounds. Low molecular weight dissolved organic carbon (LMW-DOC) is a particularly important and dynamic C pool as it is highly available to microorganisms. This thesis explored the effects of freezing temperature and freeze-thaw cycles (FTC) on the composition, concentration and fate of this SOC pool, and on the carbon and nitrogen cycles in general, in arctic <b>tundra</b> <b>soils.</b> FTC were shown to have the potential to increase LMW-DOC in arctic <b>tundra</b> <b>soils.</b> This was only observed after 1 or 2 FTC and this also depended on tundra type. The composition of this LMW-DOC also changed with new LMW-DOC compounds, changes to aromaticity and the fluorescence spectrum being observed. Plants were a source of LMW-DOC during FTC. Salix polaris vegetation produced similar compounds and fluorescence spectra to FTC subjected soil. Initial experiments on sterilised Zea mays showed plants as well as microbes could be a source of glucose and amino acids released into soil after FTC. The fate of some rapidly utilised LMW-DOC compounds was relatively unaffected by FTC in <b>tundra</b> <b>soils</b> suggesting rapid recovery of C and N cycling and the microbial community within 12 hours of thaw. Freezing temperature decreased uptake and mineralisation of LMW-DOC in a manner that was substrate specific. Progress was made in measuring and modelling unfrozen water content. The mineralisation rate of glucose was modelled using temperature and unfrozen water content. Warmer winters seemed to increase nitrification and amino acid turnover early in the growing season and also to decrease microbial biomass carbon. Earlier thaws could promote soil CO 2 emissions and increase susceptibility to FTC. In conclusion, LMW DOC concentration, composition and dynamics can be affected by FTC with the vegetation being a notable source. Microbial use of LMW DOC is affected by freezing temperature and, whilst this recovers quickly on thaw, over winter freezing temperature can have longer term impacts on C and N cycling in the arctic tundra...|$|R

40|$|Annual {{growth of}} the polar {{evergreen}} shrub Cassiope tetragona on Svalbard was evaluated {{as a proxy for}} Arctic summer temperatures. Transfer functions were derived from temperature-growth correlations of shoots and from a temperature-growth response, obtained from experimental warming using open top chambers (OTC) in high Arctic tundra vegetation at Isdammen approximately 1. 5 km southeast of Longyearbyen, Svalbard (78 °N, 15 E) and in Longyeardalen, 3 km west of Isdammen from 2004 to 2006. Air temperatures, monitored throughout the summer months, were 1. 3 °C higher inside the OTCs than in the control plots. Annual stem growth was measured by tagging stems and leaves, and in the lab with shoots harvested from OTCs and control plots. Annual growth parameters assessed were leaf production, sum of length and weight of individual leaves, and stem length increment derived from leaf scar distances and the distances between wintermarksepta in the stem. Wintermarksepta are formed {{at the end of the}} summer growth period when the pith is narrowing and consist of dense and dark tissue (Fig. 1 b). The variation of annual growth in a 34 -year site chronology (based on Cassiope shoots from the surroundings of the OTCs and control plots) correlated strongly with the mean summer temperature on Svalbard. The number of leaf pairs, leaf length and stem length also increased in the OTC warmed plots in the second and third year of warming. Transfer functions were derived from the temperature-annual growth correlations from a single shoot from Longyeardalen, from the cross-dated Isdammen site chronology and from the growth response to experimental warming. Based on leaf scar distances and distances between wintermarksepta of well-preserved subfossil shoots in arctic <b>tundra</b> <b>soil,</b> annual stem length increase was assessed for the layers of a soil core collected at the Isdammen site. Based on the derived transfer functions summer temperature of the period relating to the 15 cm deep <b>tundra</b> <b>soil</b> core layer, radiocarbon dated at 4230 ± 40 bp, may have been 3. 0 °C lower than the present-day 6. 2 °C value.

Since samples from the two biomes did not form distinct clusters on the basis of SARST data and DGGE fingerprints, factors other than latitude likely influenced the phylogenetic compositions of these communities. The high number of ribosomal sequences analyzed enabled the identification of possible cosmopolitan and endemic bacterial distributions in particular soils...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tundra</b> <b>soil</b> {{samples from}} the Canadian Arctic community, Kuujjuaq, were {{analyzed}} {{for the presence of}} the soluble (sMMO) and particulate (pMMO) methane monooxygenase genes. Total genomic DNA extracted from these soils was used as template for PCR using sMMO- and pMMO-specific primers, mmoX 1 -mmoX 2 and A 189 -A 682, respectively. pMMO and sMMO genes were detected in the Kuujjuaq soil samples. Isolation of sMMO-possessing methanotrophic microorganisms from the three soils, as determined by the colony naphthalene oxidation assay, was carried out using direct plating (5 degreesC) and methane enrichment studies (5 degreesC and 25 degrees). Direct plating did not yield sMMO-possessing methanotrophic bacteria, whereas methane enrichments yielded isolates possessing and expressing sMMO activity. Analysis of derived amino acid sequences of pmoA genes and partial 16 S rRNA genes obtained by PCR, using DNA isolated directly from this environment and from isolates, revealed the presence of highly divergent PmoA/AmoA sequences and 16 S rRNA sequences that cluster closely with but Lire distinct from the genes from the genera Methylosinus and Methylocystis.

40|$|Alaska; pyrosequencing; tussock tundra. The subarctic {{region is}} highly {{responsive}} and vulnerable to climate change. Understanding {{the structure of}} subarctic soil microbial communities is essential for predicting {{the response of the}} subarctic soil environment to climate change. To determine the composition of the bacterial community and its relationship with soil properties, we investigated the bacterial community structure and properties of surface soil from the moist acidic tussock tundra in Council, Alaska. We collected 70 soil samples with 25 -m intervals between sampling points from 0 – 10 cm to 10 – 20 cm depths. The bacterial community was ana-lyzed by pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA genes, and the following soil properties were analyzed: soil moisture content (MC), pH, total carbon (TC), total nitro-gen (TN), and inorganic nitrogen (NHþ 4 and NO 3). The community composi-tions of the two different depths showed that Alphaproteobacteria decreased with soil depth. Among the soil properties measured, soil pH was the most sig-nificant factor correlating with bacterial community in both upper and lower-layer soils. Bacterial community similarity based on jackknifed unweighted UNI-FRAC distance showed greater similarity across horizontal layers than through the vertical depth. This study showed that soil depth and pH were the most important soil properties determining bacterial community structure of the subarctic <b>tundra</b> <b>soil</b> in Council, Alaska...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{results from}} several {{studies that have}} focused on the carbon and nutrient dynamics in soils at the forest – tundra ecotone in Fennoscandia. The main objectives of the study were: (i) to investigate the links between the physical environment, above-ground vegetation communities, soil carbon storage, nutrient status and the chemical composition of the soil organic matter (SOM), and (ii) to quantify trace gas fluxes (methane and carbon dioxide) between mesic soils and the atmosphere. Four main field areas spanning an 8 degree latitudinal gradient were established at the ecotone in 1998 and studied for four years. In addition to the natural gradients we also established a warming treatment. Decomposition rates (i. e. carbon dioxide efflux and litter decomposition) were higher at our forest sites. This was linked principally to the more favourable physical environment at the forest sites, rather than to SOM quality, despite some indications of higher SOM quality at forest sites based upon conventional chemical analysis and 13 C NMR techniques. <b>Tundra</b> <b>soils</b> stored large amounts of potentially labile carbon that could readily be accessed by microorganisms when transferred to a forest environment. The interrelation between increased soil temperature and reduced soil moisture content is likely to moderate the response of decomposition rates to increased temperatures. Generally, these mesic soils showed net methane uptake from the atmosphere, which was enhanced by the warming treatment. No differences between forest or <b>tundra</b> <b>soils</b> could be detected. The major conclusions presented here are that (1) soil carbon storage is likely to be reduced if mountain birch forest replaces tundra heath and (2), methane uptake in mesic soils in the Fennoscandian mountains represents a negative feedback to further environmental change in a warmer climate...|$|R
40|$|Turnover {{rates of}} soil carbon for 20 soil types typical for a 3. 7 million km 2 area of European Russia were {{estimated}} based on 14 C data. The rates are corrected for bomb radiocarbon which strongly affects the topsoil 14 C balance. The approach is applied for carbon {{stored in the}} organic and mineral layers of the upper 1 m of the soil profile. The turnover rates of carbon in the upper 20 cm are relatively high for forest soils (0. 16 – 0. 78 % year− 1), intermediate for <b>tundra</b> <b>soils</b> (0. 25 % year− 1), and low for grassland soils (0. 02 – 0. 08 % year− 1) {{with the exception of}} southern Chernozems (0. 32 % year− 1). In the soil layer of 20 – 100 cm depth, the turnover rates were much lower for all soil types (0. 01 – 0. 06 % year− 1) except for peat bog soils of the southern taiga (0. 14 % year− 1). Combined with a map of soil type distribution and a dataset of several hundred soil carbon profiles, the method provides annual fluxes for the slowest components of soil carbon assuming that the latter is in equilibrium with climate and vegetation cover. The estimated carbon flux from the soil is highest for forest soils (12 – 147 gC/(m 2 year)), intermediate for <b>tundra</b> <b>soils</b> (33 gC/(m 2 year)), and lowest for grassland soils (1 – 26 gC/(m 2 year)). The approach does not distinguish active and recalcitrant carbon fractions and this explains the low turnover rates in the top layer. Since changes in soil types will follow changes in climate and land cover, we suggest that pedogenesis is an important factor influencing the future dynamics of soil carbon fluxes. Up to now, both the effect of soil type changes and the clear evidence from 14 C measurements that most soil organic carbon has a millennial time scale, are basically neglected in the global carbon cycle models used for projections of atmospheric CO 2 in 21 st century and beyond...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{activity}} in Arctic tundra ecosystems continues {{through the winter}} and {{is an important component}} of the annual C budget. This activity is sensitive to climatic variation, particularly snow depth because that regulates soil temperature. The influence of winter conditions on soil N cycling is poorly understood. In this study, we used intact core incubations sampled periodically through the winter and following growing season to measure net N mineralization and nitrification in dry heath and in moist tussock tundra under ambient and experimentally increased snow depths (by use of a snowfence). In dry heath, we sampled soils under Dryas octopetela or Arctostaphylos alpine, while in tussock tundra, we sampled Eriophorum vaginatum tussocks and Sphagnum dominated areas between tussocks. Our objectives were to: (1) examine how different winter snow regimes influenced year-round N dynamics in the two tundra types, and (2) evaluate how these responses are affected by dominant species present in each system. In tussock <b>tundra,</b> <b>soils</b> with increased winter snow cover had high net N mineralization rates during the fall and winter, followed by immobilization during thaw. In contrast, N mineralization only occurred during the autumn in soils with ambient snow cover. During the growing season when N immobilization dominated in areas with ambient snow cover, soils with increased winter snow cover had positive net mineralization and nitrification rates. In dry heath <b>tundra,</b> <b>soils</b> with increased snow depth had high late winter net N mineralization rates, but these rates were: (a) comparable to early winter rates in soils under Arctostaphylos plants with ambient snow cover; (b) greater in soils under Arctostaphylos plants than in soils under Dryas plants; and (c) less than the rates found in tussock tundra. Our findings suggest under ambient snow conditions, low soil temperatures limit soil N mineralization, but that deeper snow conditions with the associated warmer winter soil temperatures dramatically increase over-winter N mineralization and thereby alter the amount and timing of plant-available N in tundra ecosystems.
