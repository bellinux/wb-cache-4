5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens <b>the</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>cabinet</b> and tossing all the pills in <b>the</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>cabinet</b> over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Nick Adams {{has been cited}} in {{articles}} and books about Hollywood's unsolved mysteries along with speculation by a few of Adams' acquaintances he was murdered (according to author David Kulczyk, Adams was apparently planning to write a tell-all book revealing many sexual secrets of Hollywood names) and claims no trace of paraldehyde (a liquid sedative often given to alcoholics {{at the time and}} one of two drugs attributed to his death) was ever found in his home. However, Adams' brother Andrew had become a medical doctor and prescribed the sedative to him. Moreover, a story in the Los Angeles Times reported stoppered bottles with prescription labels were found in <b>the</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>cabinet</b> near the upstairs bedroom where Adams' body was discovered. Through the years, Adams' children offered speculation ranging from murder to accidental death, the latter perhaps caused by Roeder while trying to calm the actor's nerves with an unintentionally lethal combination of alcohol and prescription drugs (although the autopsy found no alcohol in Adams' blood). Actor Robert Conrad, Adams' best friend, has consistently maintained the death was accidental.|$|E

Eric arguably has the best cabinet, but he fails to mount it. Brian M eventually passes, even though in his own words it took him three hours to do a 90-minute job.|$|E

40|$|In {{everyday}} life {{we are often}} faced {{with the need to}} monitor the contents of some kind of container e. g. the contents of a <b>medicine</b> <b>cabinet</b> or a tool box. In this paper we show that this entire class of scenarios has similar features and properties. To remove the annoyance associated by the user with this monitoring task we propose a smart box concept. In this concept the monitoring is facilitated by any automatic identification technology. RFID technology proved to be a suitable means to invisibly monitor the contents of the box without requiring the user to adapt the way he interacts with the smart objects. We describe the characteristics of the smart box concept and then demonstrate the usability of the smart box concept with three applications: the smart toolbox, <b>the</b> smart <b>medicine</b> <b>cabinet</b> and <b>the</b> smart surgical kit...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} self-reported health {{complaints and}} <b>the</b> use of <b>medicines</b> among adolescents in Malta. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire {{was used to}} survey self-reported health complaints, the use and <b>the</b> sources of <b>medicines</b> that had been accessed, during the preceding 3 months among adolescents attending secondary schools in Malta. A stratified random sample design generated a sample size of 514 students. The health complaints and use of medicines that were investigated included ear problems/hay fever/cold/cough, headache, skin problems, sport injuries, indigestion/diarrhoea/constipation, eye problems and menstrual pain (for girls). The use of vitamins and antibiotics was also investigated. Results: A total of 477 students participated in the final data collection. Correct information was submitted by 474 students, (aged 14 - 16 years), who formed the analytical sample, of which 53. 8 % were girls. The students reported a mean number of 2. 70 (SD = 1. 39) {{out of a total}} of 7 health complaints and 90. 3 % reported using at least 1 <b>medicine</b> during <b>the</b> preceding 3 months. The community pharmacy was cited as the most commonly accessed source for most of <b>the</b> <b>medicines</b> that were investigated. A proportion of 24. 3 % of the students had taken at least 1 medicine without adult guidance during the preceding 3 months. Almost 10 % of those who had taken antibiotics, had accessed them from <b>the</b> home <b>medicine</b> <b>cabinet.</b> Conclusion: A high proportion of adolescents in Malta reported <b>the</b> use of <b>medicines</b> to alleviate <b>the</b> symptoms of common health complaints. This result is concordant with previous research carried out in the United Kingdom, Germany, Slovakia and Kuwait. A considerable proportion of students in this study had obtained medicines without adult guidance and accessed antibiotics from <b>the</b> home <b>medicine</b> <b>cabinet.</b> This highlights <b>the</b> importance of carefully designed education programs for adolescents that will integrate information about the proper use of medicines...|$|R

Tom becomes furious after realizing that he was tricked, grabs a sword and ready to get back at Jerry. He finds the mouse sitting hunched-up with head in hands, looking very depressed somehow and he only blinks at Tom apathetically when prodded with the sword's keen point. Only when Tom snatches him up does Jerry break out in genuine measles spots, which proliferate before Tom's horrified gaze. Tom quickly dashes to the bathroom and wash his hands and then doses himself frantically with everything he can find from <b>the</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>cabinet</b> (throat sprays, pills, mouthwash, nasal drops, etc., but little does he know that there is no cure for measles), while a sped-up version of George Frideric Handel's Death March plays over.|$|E
