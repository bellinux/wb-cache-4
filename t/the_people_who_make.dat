[...] Somerset's president, Colin Atkinson spoke to representatives from Worcestershire {{the day after the}} game and offered to play the match again, but his suggestion was rejected.

However, due to the strength and volume of complaints, a special meeting of the TCCB was called for 1 June. At that meeting, Somerset were disqualified from the competition by seventeen votes to one. Only the representative from Derbyshire opposed it, with even Somerset voting for the expulsion. Due to Somerset's disqualification, Glamorgan joined Worcestershire in the quarter-finals. As it turned out, had Somerset played the game as normal, they would have qualified, as Glamorgan's match against the Minor Counties ended with no result due to rain, leaving them two points behind Somerset and Worcestershire.|$|E

2500|$|For Ryerson, an {{understanding}} of social relations was paramount if one was to garner {{an understanding}} of history; his encounter with Innis's materialism led Ryerson to the charge that equated Marxism and economic determinism.
