5|$|The mid-level African easterly jet {{occurs during}} the Northern Hemisphere summer between 10°N and 20°N above West Africa, and the nocturnal poleward {{low-level}} jet {{occurs in the}} Great Plains of east and South Africa. The low-level easterly African jet stream is considered to {{play a crucial role}} in the southwest monsoon of Africa, and helps form the tropical waves which move across the tropical Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans during the warm season. The formation of the <b>thermal</b> <b>low</b> over northern Africa leads to a low-level westerly jet stream from June into October.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Julio quickly {{weakened}} over land, {{although it}} initially maintained strong convection near its center. By early on August 26, however, the low-level and upper-level circulations separated, with the upper-circulation continuing quickly northeastward into mainland Mexico; the low-level circulation slowed as it entered the Gulf of California, {{after having been}} separated from its deep convection.

5|$|In meteorology, {{winds are}} often {{referred}} to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as , gale, storm, and hurricane. Wind occurs {{on a range of}} scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics, <b>thermal</b> <b>low</b> circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.|$|E

5|$|Over {{elevated}} surfaces, heating of {{the ground}} exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above sea level, creating an associated <b>thermal</b> <b>low</b> over the terrain and enhancing any thermal lows that would have otherwise existed, and changing the wind circulation of the region. In areas where there is rugged topography that significantly interrupts the environmental wind flow, the wind circulation between mountains and valleys {{is the most important}} contributor to the prevailing winds. Hills and valleys substantially distort the airflow by increasing friction between the atmosphere and landmass by acting as a physical block to the flow, deflecting the wind parallel to the range just upstream of the topography, which is known as a barrier jet. This barrier jet can increase the low level wind by 45%. Wind direction also changes because of the contour of the land.|$|E
25|$|The {{rainfall}} inhibition and the dissipation {{of cloud}} cover are most accentuated over the eastern {{section of the}} Sahara rather than the western. The prevailing air mass lying above the Sahara is the continental tropical (cT) air mass, which is hot and dry. Hot, dry air masses primarily form over the North-African desert from the heating of the vast continental land area, and it affects the whole desert {{during most of the}} year. Because of this extreme heating process, a <b>thermal</b> <b>low</b> is usually noticed near the surface, and is the strongest and the most developed during the summertime. The Sahara High represents the eastern continental extension of the Azores High, centered over the North Atlantic Ocean. The subsidence of the Sahara High nearly reaches the ground during the coolest part of the year while it is confined to the upper troposphere during the hottest periods.|$|E
500|$|In {{areas where}} it is hilly or mountainous near the coastline, thermally-forced sea breezes {{combined}} with wind circulations {{up the sides of}} the mountains can encourage the production of chemicals which can lead to the development of smog. [...] Pollution has been tracked into the mid-levels of the troposphere in the form of ozone, which is concentrated over the circulation of the <b>thermal</b> <b>low</b> as well as adjacent oceanic areas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>lows</b> form due to {{localized}} heating {{caused by}} greater sunshine over deserts and other land masses. Since localized areas of warm air are less dense than their surroundings, this warmer air rises, which lowers atmospheric pressure near {{that portion of}} the Earth's surface. Large-scale <b>thermal</b> <b>lows</b> over continents help drive monsoon circulations. Low-pressure areas can also form due to organized thunderstorm activity over warm water. When this occurs over the tropics in concert with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, it is known as a monsoon trough. Monsoon troughs reach their northerly extent in August and their southerly extent in February. When a convective low acquires a well-hot circulation in the tropics it is termed a tropical cyclone. Tropical cyclones can form during any month of the year globally, but can occur in either the northern or southern hemisphere during November.|$|R

500|$|If a {{circulation}} forms within the monsoon trough, it {{is able to}} compete with the neighboring <b>thermal</b> <b>low</b> over the continent, and a wind surge will occur at its periphery. [...] Such {{a circulation}} which is broad in nature within a monsoon trough is known as a monsoon depression. [...] In the Northern Hemisphere, monsoon depressions are generally asymmetric, and tend to have their strongest winds on their eastern periphery. [...] Light and variable winds cover a large area near their center, while bands of showers and thunderstorms develop within their area of circulation.|$|E
500|$|In deserts, lack {{of ground}} and plant {{moisture}} {{that would normally}} provide evaporative cooling can lead to intense, rapid solar heating of the lower layers of air. The hot air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in a low pressure area called a <b>thermal</b> <b>low.</b> [...] Over elevated surfaces, heating of the ground exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above sea level, which creates an associated heat low over the terrain and enhances any thermal lows which would have otherwise existed. [...] During the cold season, (winter), warm water bodies such as the Great Lakes can induce an instability low. [...] Thermal lows which develop near sea level can build in height during the warm season, or summer, to the elevation of the 700 hPa pressure surface, which lies near [...] above sea level. [...] Heat lows normally are stationary and have a weak cyclonic circulation. [...] As they are strongest at the surface and warm near their center, and weaker aloft where the air is more stable, the <b>thermal</b> <b>low</b> is considered warm core. [...] The strongest versions of these features globally are over Arabia, the northern portion of the Indian subcontinent, Arizona, Mexican plateau, northwest Argentina, southwestern Spain, Australia, and northern Africa.

500|$|Prevailing {{winds are}} winds that blow {{predominantly}} {{from a single}} general direction over a particular point on the Earth's surface. The dominant winds are the trends in direction of wind with the highest speed over a particular point on the Earth's surface. A region's prevailing and dominant winds acted by global patterns of movement in the Earth's atmosphere. [...] In general, easterly flow occurs at low and medium latitudes globally. In the mid-latitudes, westerly winds are the rule and their strength is largely determined by the polar cyclone.

500|$|Along the California coast, {{the cooler}} water {{sets up a}} surface marine layer that is much cooler than inland areas during the summer. [...] At the same time, the intense heating inland creates a {{pronounced}} thermal trough aligned with the Great Central Valley and typically linked to the broader <b>thermal</b> <b>low</b> across the North American deserts. [...] As a consequence, a strong pressure gradient is created which draws cool marine air landward. [...] As temperatures plummet, fog and stratus stream in and through the gaps of the Coast Ranges, and especially through the Golden Gate at San Francisco (see San Francisco fog). [...] The same thermal trough is sometimes pushed toward the coast, especially in late Fall as higher pressure develops to the east due to cooling further east. [...] This setup often brings the warmest temperatures {{of the year to}} the normally cool coastline as the seabreeze stops or is even replaced by a dangerously dry land breeze.|$|E
500|$|Over land, intense, rapid {{solar heating}} {{of the land}} surface results in heating of the lowest layers of the {{atmosphere}} via reradiated energy in the infrared spectrum.

[...] Wind direction changes due to the contour of the land. [...] If there is a pass in the mountain range, winds will rush through the pass with considerable speed due to the Bernoulli principle that describes an inverse relationship between speed and pressure.

500|$|Well {{before the}} start of the rainfall, much of Arizona had been {{affected}} by a wet winter and subsequent monsoon season leaving the grounds saturated and susceptible to flooding. [...] Moreover, the months of August and September had been very wet months for most of the Southwestern United States. In fact, it had rained almost every other day at many weather stations in Arizona. The remnants of a Pacific hurricane brought rain to much of California and part of Arizona. Then, on September 22, the North American Monsoon became active over the region. This was atypical for late September; by this time, in a normal year the climate is dry. However, in late September1983, surface weather maps exhibited a few unusual features. A <b>thermal</b> <b>low</b> lay over the mouth of the Gulf of California while the tail end of a weak cold front was located atop of the Great Basin. On September28, moisture from the storm began spreading across Mexico and the southwest United States, due to a stalled low pressure area off the coast of California drawing the thunderstorms northeastward. Tropical Storm Octave played a vital role in the disaster by supplying warm, moisture to the region, which collided with cooler air from the subtropics. By October 2, the heaviest rainfall had ended.|$|E
500|$|In deserts, lack {{of ground}} and plant {{moisture}} {{that would normally}} provide evaporative cooling can lead to intense, rapid solar heating of the lower layers of air. The hot air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in a low-pressure area called a <b>thermal</b> <b>low.</b> [...] Monsoon circulations are caused by thermal lows which form over large areas of land and their strength is driven by how land heats more quickly than the surrounding nearby ocean. [...] This generates a steady wind blowing toward the land, bringing the moist near-surface air over the oceans with it. [...] Similar rainfall {{is caused by the}} moist ocean-air being lifted upwards by mountains, surface heating, convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows at the surface. However the lifting occurs, the air cools due to expansion in lower pressure, which in turn produces condensation. [...] In winter, the land cools off quickly, but the ocean keeps the heat longer due to its higher specific heat. The hot air over the ocean rises, creating a low-pressure area and a breeze from land to ocean while a large area of drying high pressure is formed over the land, increased by wintertime cooling. [...] Monsoons resemble sea and land breezes, terms usually referring to the localized, diurnal (daily) cycle of circulation near coastlines everywhere, but they are much larger in scale - also stronger and seasonal.|$|E
500|$|The {{equatorial}} region near the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), or monsoon trough, is the wettest {{portion of the}} world's continents. Annually, the rain belt within the tropics marches northward by August, then moves back southward into the Southern Hemisphere by February and March. Within Asia, rainfall is favored across its southern portion from India east and northeast across the Philippines and southern China into Japan due to the monsoon advecting moisture primarily from the Indian Ocean into the region. The monsoon trough can reach {{as far north as}} the 40th parallel in East Asia during August before moving southward thereafter. Its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon which is characterized by the development of lower air pressure (a <b>thermal</b> <b>low)</b> over the warmest part of Asia. Similar, but weaker, monsoon circulations are present over North America and Australia. During the summer, the Southwest monsoon combined with Gulf of California and Gulf of Mexico moisture moving around the subtropical ridge in the Atlantic Ocean bring the promise of afternoon and evening thunderstorms to the southern tier of the United States as well as the Great Plains. The eastern half of the contiguous United States east of the 98th meridian, the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, and the Sierra Nevada range are the wetter portions of the nation, with average rainfall exceeding [...] per year.
