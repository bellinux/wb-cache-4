5|$|Reign in Blood was {{recorded}} and produced in Los Angeles with Rubin. The album was the label boss' first professional experience with heavy metal, and his fresh perspective {{led to a}} drastic makeover of Slayer's sound. Steve Huey of AllMusic believed Rubin drew <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> faster songs from the band, and delivered a cleanly produced sound that contrasted sharply with their previous recordings. This resulted in drastic changes to Slayer's sound, and changed audiences' perception of the band. Araya has since stated their two previous releases were not up to par production-wise.|$|E
5|$|The {{reformed}} band {{worked at}} a prolific pace, rehearsing, and touring France before recording three new albums in just 12 months, beginning with Godbluff (October 1975). Unlike the earlier work with John Anthony at Trident, the sessions were produced by the band themselves, and both the Melody Maker and Sounds thought they were a <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> more cohesive unit than previously. The album in particular saw Hammill making significant use of the Hohner clavinet keyboard. Still Life followed on 15 April 1976. Banton considers this album one of his favourites by the group.|$|E

The muscle that surrounds the vaginal opening grows <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> the uterus elevates and grows in size. The vaginal walls begin to produce a lubricating organic liquid. Meanwhile, the breasts increase slightly in size and nipples become hardened and erect.|$|E

This was {{followed}} by their own first UK tour in May and June, selling out dates in Shoreditch, London and The Plug in home-town Sheffield on the final night. A second tour followed in October 2006, showing great progression as a band. The sound was much <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> far more advanced than on their previous tour.|$|E
25|$|With professionalism {{far from}} {{foremost}} concern, The Aquabats' earliest band line-ups changed with almost every concert, occasionally featuring {{as many as}} twelve to fourteen musicians at a time onstage, with the majority typically playing brass instruments. As they gradually developed a steady following and began playing shows with more regularity, the band settled into a <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> more manageable unit consisting of around eight to nine musicians, filled out by a horn section, two guitarists and a keyboardist. It was {{with this type of}} line-up that The Aquabats began recording, independently producing the demo tapes The Revenge of the Midget Punchers in 1994 and Bat Boy in 1995.|$|E
25|$|Many asteroids {{have been}} placed in groups and {{families}} based on their orbital characteristics. Apart from the broadest divisions, it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered. Groups are relatively loose dynamical associations, whereas families are <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> result from the catastrophic break-up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past. Families are more common and easier to identify within the main asteroid belt, but several small families have been reported among the Jupiter trojans. Main belt families were first recognized by Kiyotsugu Hirayama in 1918 and are often called Hirayama families in his honor.|$|E

25|$|Thrash metal {{generally}} features fast tempos, low-register, complex guitar riffs, high-register guitar solos {{and double}} bass drumming. The genre {{evolved in the}} early 1980s from combining the drum beats of hardcore punk with the guitar style of {{the new wave of}} British heavy metal. It emerged partially as a reaction to the more conventional and widely acceptable glam metal, a less aggressive, pop-infused heavy metal subgenre which appeared simultaneously. The rhythm guitar parts are played with heavy distortion and often palm muted to create a <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> more precise sound. Vocally, thrash metal can employ anything from melodic singing to shouted vocals. Most guitar solos are played at high speed, as they are usually characterized by shredding, and use techniques such as sweep picking, legato phrasing, alternate picking, tremolo picking, string skipping, and two-hand tapping.|$|E
25|$|Montoya {{dominated}} the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard in Indianapolis on July 26 after starting from second position. It {{was the first}} time in his NASCAR career that he scored bonus points for leading the most laps in the event, however, he was penalized with a drive-through penalty after his last pit stop for speeding in the pit lane. His healthy 5-second advantage over the rest of the field was gone and he ended up finishing 11th. After a pit lane error Montoya slipped back from his top-10 spot at the Sunoco Red Cross Pennsylvania 500 at Pocono Raceway. However, a good pit call meant Montoya pitted prior to a caution which meant he started the next restart in 4th. After slipping back to 5th he made up good ground to pass Bowyer second. He went after leader Hamlin but could not catch him. The second-place finish was his first top 5 of the year and joint best on an oval. At the Carfax 400 at Michigan, Montoya posted the 3rd quickest qualifying time just 0.087 seconds off of the pole. In the race Montoya gradually slipped back and grew frustrated with crew chief Brian Pattie as the car was getting <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> tighter, Kasey Kahne and Montoya made contact when the 9 car got loose and its splitter touched the 42's right rear tire. The contact resulted in Montoya's right rear going flat and he lost a lap on pit road fixing the minor body damage. However he shortly got the lucky dog and raced up to 20th before dropping back to 23rd, Montoya gained 4 positions on the last lap as others ran out of fuel, resulting in a 19th-place finish which at least kept Juan 7th in points.|$|E

500|$|Often grouped {{with urban}} and rural {{sociology}} is that of community sociology or the sociology of community. Taking various communities—including online communities—as the unit of analysis, community sociologists study the origin and effects of different associations of people. For instance, German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies distinguished between two types of human association: Gemeinschaft (usually translated as [...] "community") and Gesellschaft ("society" [...] or [...] "association"). In his 1887 work, Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft, Tönnies argued that Gemeinschaft {{is perceived to be}} a <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a [...] "unity of will". The 'development' or 'health' of a community is also a central concern of community sociologists also engage in development sociology, exemplified by the literature surrounding the concept of social capital.|$|E
500|$|IGN, {{in giving}} the album 8.9 out of 10, said [...] "the playing overall seems <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> more cohesive" [...] {{and that the}} album is a [...] "grandiose project, one teeming with jubilant enthusiasm and reverent abundance." [...] Other {{publications}} agreed, but felt such was a negative. Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke wrote that he was surprised such a large band could [...] "sound so distant here so often," [...] saying that [...] "the result is a huge sound that only sparkles on the edges, leaving Butler alone in the middle." [...] However, Rolling Stone also named it the fourth best album of the year.

500|$|Reviewing the band's show in Auckland, Chris Schulz {{wrote that}} vocalist Taylor's {{performance}} was [...] "schizophrenic" [...] {{and that his}} [...] "unpredictable, passive-aggressive nature" [...] was {{the focal point of}} Slipknot's live show. He also declared percussionist Crahan the [...] "most menacing member of Slipknot", noting that in a [...] "particularly violent" [...] version of [...] "Duality" [...] he [...] "appeared pleased to play his part in the song by violating an empty keg with a baseball bat." [...] When reviewing the same show, Scott Kara of The New Zealand Herald compared Slipknot's performance to their appearance at the 2005 Big Day Out festival, noting that [...] "the gruesome obscenities, the vomiting, and fights" [...] were absent, which made for [...] "a far <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> more solid" [...] performance. Kara also commented upon the connection the fans had with the show, saying that in songs like [...] "The Heretic Anthem" [...] Taylor [...] "hardly needs to sing" [...] due to the involvement of the audience.|$|E

500|$|Hex Enduction Hour was {{the first}} Fall album to make the UK Albums Chart, where it spent three weeks, peaking at no. 71. By mid-1983 it had sold 20,000 copies, {{reflecting}} a surge in the band's popularity, and five years into their career {{brought them to the}} attention of record labels. Critics were highly enthusiastic; according to Simon Ford, they could [...] "have hardly been more supportive". Reviewing the album in the NME, Richard Cook described the band as <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> more disciplined than in earlier recordings, [...] "their master piece to date", while still maintaining their impact. He praised the band's use of recording-studio techniques and atmospherics without resorting to glamorisation. Melody Makers Colin Irwin said it was [...] "incredibly exciting and utterly compelling". [...] A dissenter was Neil McCormick of Irish fortnightly Hot Press, who dismissed the album as secondhand melodramatic punk and wondered if the album was [...] "meant to be minimalist or primitive then it fatally ignores the true primitivism of the strong melody and accessible lyrics found in folk music." ...|$|E
500|$|Revisions to the Tabac {{corner at}} the harbour {{section of the}} race track meant that the drivers now entered the turn {{slightly}} earlier, shortening the track by [...] compared to previous years, and making the corner slightly <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> slower. The corner had seen a race-stopping accident involving Pastor Maldonado and Max Chilton in 2013, leading to the changes being made. This resulted in the circuit being officially classified as a new layout. The barrier {{on the right of}} the swimming pool chicane was moved back, with new kerbs, to allow for a better view of the corner. Much of the track was resurfaced before the event. As in Australia and Singapore, the pit lane speed limit {{for the duration of the}} event was reduced to , instead of the standard , due to the confined nature of the circuit. The race schedule for the weekend was different in Monaco compared to the other races on the calendar. The first two free practice sessions were held on Thursday instead of Friday.|$|E
500|$|Various {{aspects of}} {{gameplay}} garnered a mixed reception from critics, though the game's control scheme {{received the most}} criticism. A reviewer from GamePro criticized the control configuration and felt that the game was a mediocre example of a pinball game, but admitted {{that it had a}} similar feel to previous Sonic the Hedgehog titles. Jeuxvideo.com's reviewer enjoyed how Sonic himself acted as a pinball, but noticed that the controls were less precise and responsive when compared to other platformers. Whitehead asserted that the game's controls were [...] "muddled by the half-and-half approach" [...] and criticized its [...] "clunky" [...] game engine, saying that the game's control scheme ruined the pinball environments. Thomas stated [...] "there are aspects of the control that could have been <b>tighter,</b> <b>and</b> its difficulty level may be a bit too extreme for new players." [...] Damien McFarren from NintendoLife said that the game comes across as both a poor platformer and a poor pinball game due to its unconvincing ball physics and frustrating platform elements. Bob Strauss of Entertainment Weekly felt the game initially boasted a [...] "terrific" [...] concept but had an ultimately flawed execution—saying that Sonic, acting as a pinball, often moved like a [...] "leaden marble". Rich Leadbetter from Mean Machines also expressed concern over the game's lack of replay value, saying that despite its addictive gameplay the game's four levels were not enough, especially given its high price.|$|E

500|$|Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly {{said the}} episode was [...] "solid all-around" [...] and {{especially}} liked Leslie's blind date with the elderly man and Chris Pratt, especially his listing {{of all his}} previous band names. Medina said, [...] "Parks and Recreation is only six episodes in, and it's already better than I anticipated. It has its own tone, a talented cast, and a plot that's advancing toward something, at least as fast as governmental red tape will allow it to." [...] Richard Lawson of Gawker said the episode {{was the best of}} the season and that he liked the wistful pacing and Poehler's performance. Lawson said, [...] "Anyone who dismissed this show after its first sorta underwhelming episode made a mistake. The show has only gotten <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> sharper, culminating in last night's funny/sad finale." [...] Time television reviewer James Poniewozik said the episode was the best yet for developing Poehler into a [...] "more multi-facted, less risible character". He also said the supporting staff played [...] "flawlessly" [...] off each other in the rock show scene, and thinks there is [...] "huge potential" [...] in the dynamic between Leslie and her undermining mother. Not all reviews of the episode were positive. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune said the Leslie Knope character was unappealing in [...] "Rock Show" [...] and throughout the first season, which she said surpassed the Friends spin-off Joey as [...] "the worst example of NBC's tendency to extend its franchises well beyond what is desirable or logical." ...|$|E
500|$|Carlo Santos of the Anime News Network {{described}} Dragon Balls setting as [...] "a {{melting pot}} of sci-fi, fantasy, and folklore". Santos praised its quick {{development of new}} characters and storylines, and claimed that the series' crowning achievement is in its dynamic fight scenes. However, he did not enjoy the cliché training and tournament segments, nor its crude humor. His colleague Allen Divers praised the manga's story and humor as being very good at conveying all the characters' personalities. Divers also called Viz's translation {{one of the best}} of all the English editions of the series due to its faithfulness to the original Japanese. Animerica felt the series had [...] "worldwide appeal," [...] using dramatic pacing and over-the-top martial arts action to [...] "maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audience's attention spans". Comic Book Bin's Leroy Douresseaux described Toriyama as a [...] "super-cartoonist," [...] a blend of Carl Barks, Jack Kirby, and Peyo. He gave Dragon Ball a perfect rating and called it one of the best manga and comic books he has ever read. Ridwan Khan of Animefringe.com commented that the manga had a [...] "chubby" [...] art style, but as the series continued the characters became more refined, leaner, and more muscular. He cited one slight problem in Viz's release; the translation uses informal language to capture Goku's country accent, but it ends up feeling [...] "forced and odd". Khan prefers the manga over the slow pacing of the anime adaptations. Ollie Barber writing for Forbes echoed Khan stating with a lot less padding, the manga's [...] "pacing is a lot <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> makes you realize how talented Dragon Ball's creator Akira Toriyama truly is when he chooses to flex his storytelling muscles".|$|E
500|$|Survivor {{contains}} themes {{interpreted by}} the public as {{a reference to the}} group's internal conflict. The title track, [...] "Survivor", which set the theme used throughout the album, features the lyrics [...] "I'm not gonna blast you on the radio... I'm not gonna lie on you or your family... I'm not gonna hate you in the magazine" [...] caused [...] Roberson and Luckett to file a lawsuit against the group; the lyrics were perceived to be a violation over their agreement following a settlement in court. In an interview, Knowles commented: [...] "The lyrics to the single 'Survivor' are Destiny's Child's story, because we've been through a lot,... We went through our drama with the members... Any complications we've had in our 10-year period of time have made us closer and <b>tighter</b> <b>and</b> better." [...] In another song called [...] "Fancy", which contains the lyrics [...] "You always tried to compete with me, girl... find your own identity", was interpreted by critic David Browne, in his review of the album for Entertainment Weekly magazine, {{as a response to the}} lawsuit. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic summarized Survivor as [...] "a determined, bullheaded record, intent on proving Destiny's Child has artistic merit largely because the group survived internal strife.... It's a record that tries to be a bold statement of purpose, but winds up feeling forced and artificial." [...] Despite the album's receiving critical praise, Knowles' close involvement has occasionally generated criticism. Knowles wrote and co-produced the bulk of Survivor. Browne suggested that her help made Survivor a [...] "premature, but inevitable, growing pains album". In the majority of the songs on their final studio album Destiny Fulfilled (2004), the verses are divided into three sections, with Knowles singing first, followed by Rowland, then Williams; the three harmonize together during the choruses.|$|E
