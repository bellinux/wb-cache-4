5|$|A watch post {{existed on}} Punta di Santa Maria (now known as Tigné Point after the fort) in 1417. The post was {{probably}} a small unfortified structure, which was manned by three persons. <b>The</b> <b>peninsula</b> {{played a significant role}} during the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, when the invading Ottomans built a battery on it in order to bombard Fort Saint Elmo. After the siege, <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> became known as Dragut Point after the Ottoman corsair Dragut.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, {{the northeastern}} portion of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> is characterised by forested swamplands. The {{northern}} portion of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> lacks rivers, {{except for the}} Champotón River – all other rivers {{are located in the}} south. The Sibun River flows from west to east from south central Quintana Roo to Lake Bacalar on the Caribbean Coast; the Río Hondo flows northwards from Belize to empty into the same lake. Bacalar Lake empties into Chetumal Bay. The Río Nuevo flows from Lamanai Lake in Belize northwards to Chetumal Bay. The Mopan River and the Macal River flow through Belize and join to form the Belize River, which empties into the Caribbean Sea. In the southwest of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula,</b> the San Pedro River, the Candelaría River and the Mamantel River, which all form a part of the Gulf of Mexico drainage.|$|E
5|$|Iyo Railway {{bus service}} runs {{up and down}} <b>the</b> <b>peninsula,</b> to and from Yawatahama, and offers express buses from Misaki to Matsuyama. However, {{commuter}} buses run infrequently and, due {{to the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> and the scattered nature of the town's neighborhoods, bus travel remains more expensive and less convenient than in denser areas. Some tour buses also come across the strait from Kyūshū by ferry.|$|E

One of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula's</b> largest bays, Gillnet Haven Bay southeast of Fayette on <b>the</b> <b>peninsula's</b> eastern shore, commemorates the gill nets used by Lake Michigan's Native American fishermen.|$|R
5|$|Some of <b>the</b> best-known <b>peninsulas</b> in Ireland are in County Kerry; <b>the</b> Dingle <b>peninsula,</b> <b>the</b> {{aforementioned}} Iveragh <b>peninsula</b> and <b>the</b> Beara <b>peninsula.</b> <b>The</b> Ards <b>peninsula</b> {{is one of}} <b>the</b> larger <b>peninsulas</b> outside Kerry. <b>The</b> Inishowen <b>peninsula</b> in County Donegal includes Ireland's most northerly point, Malin Head {{and several}} important towns including Buncrana on Lough Swilly, Carndonagh and Moville on Lough Foyle. Ireland's most northerly land feature is Inishtrahull island, off Malin Head. Rockall Island may deserve this honour but its status is disputed, being claimed by the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Denmark (for the Faroe Islands) and Iceland. The most southerly point is the Fastnet Rock.|$|R
5|$|Lighthouse Point {{contains}} 64 cottages and 40 {{cabins and}} is located {{along the west}} bank of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula.</b> The centerpiece of Lighthouse Point is the Cedar Point Light, which was built in 1862 and is the oldest existing structure on <b>the</b> <b>peninsula.</b> It has an outdoor pool and outdoor whirlpool spa, a shuffleboard court, a game room, and shuttle service.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, Rome had {{expanded}} {{along the southern}} Iberian coast until in 211 BC it captured the city of Saguntum. Following two major military expeditions to Iberia, the Romans finally crushed Carthaginian control of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> in 206 BC, at the Battle of Ilipa, and <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> became a Roman province known as Hispania. From 206 BC onwards the only opposition to Roman control of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> came from within the native Celtiberian tribes themselves, whose disunity prevented their security from Roman expansion.|$|E
5|$|Point Loma {{contains}} {{a few small}} neighborhood parks and the Cabrillo Recreation Center. There is large waterfront park at Liberty Station, which also {{contains a}} nine-hole golf course. Most of the ocean frontage of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> is a public shoreline park called Sunset Cliffs Natural Park. The Point Loma Native Plant Garden features plants and flowers native to the San Diego area. Cabrillo National Monument is a federal historic park {{at the southern end}} of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula.</b>|$|E

50|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula's</b> {{hardwoods}} {{were cut}} down {{for use in}} the charcoal-fired iron furnaces operated by the Jackson Iron Company in 1867-1891 at what is now Fayette State Park, on <b>the</b> <b>peninsula's</b> western shore. With its access to Great Lakes shipping, the remaining lumber of <b>the</b> Garden <b>Peninsula</b> was largely logged by the 1890s.|$|R

5|$|The Ottoman force {{prepared}} to repel a landing {{on either side}} of the Straits was the 5th Army. This force, which initially consisted of five divisions with another en route, was a conscript force, commanded by von Sanders. Many of the senior officers in the 5th Army were also German. Ottoman commanders and senior German officers debated the best means of defending <b>the</b> <b>peninsula.</b> All agreed that the best defence was to hold the high ground on the ridges of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula.</b> There was disagreement as to where the enemy would land and hence where to concentrate forces. Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Kemal was familiar with the Gallipoli peninsula from his operations against Bulgaria in the Balkan Wars and forecast that Cape Helles (the southern tip of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula)</b> and Gaba Tepe were the likely areas for landing.|$|E

5|$|The Yucatán Peninsula is {{bordered by}} the Caribbean Sea {{to the east}} and by the Gulf of Mexico to the north and west. It {{incorporates}} the modern Mexican states of Yucatán, Quintana Roo and Campeche, the eastern portion of the state of Tabasco, most of the Guatemalan department of Petén, and all of Belize. Most of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> is formed by a vast plain with few hills or mountains and a generally low coastline. The northwestern and northern portions of the Yucatán Peninsula experience lower rainfall {{than the rest of the}} peninsula; these regions feature highly porous limestone bedrock resulting in less surface water. In contrast, the northeastern portion of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> is characterised by forested swamplands. The northern portion of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> lacks rivers, except for the Champotón River – all other rivers are located in the south.|$|E
5|$|The cliffs on {{the ocean}} side of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> are sheer and are {{undergoing}} constant erosion due to wave action. On the east side the land slopes into San Diego Bay more gradually, so that homes and developments {{go right to the}} water's edge. At the northern end of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> the cliffs and hills become lower, disappearing entirely in Ocean Beach and the Midway area, where the San Diego River flows.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>peninsula</b> {{features}} {{thin and}} acidic soil, and hosts plants like witherod, Indian pear, Labrador tea, wintergreen, and blueberry shrubs. It is a woodland area, with birch, tamarack, maple, oak, beech, and white pine trees. Given {{the development of}} the land by the Armdale Yacht Club, plant growth is now largely limited to the hill on which the main clubhouse sits; most of <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> was paved in 1971. Fish caught from Melville Island include cod and mackerel. Local birds include grebes, loons, and alcids.|$|E

50|$|Sulawesi is the world's eleventh-largest island, {{covering}} {{an area of}} 174600 km2. The {{central part}} of the island is ruggedly mountainous, such that <b>the</b> island's <b>peninsulas</b> have traditionally been remote from each other, with better connections by sea than by road. The three bays that divide Sulawesi's peninsulas are, from north to south, the Tomini, the Tolo and the Boni.

5|$|The {{terrain of}} <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> {{has much to}} do with the geology of the Aegean Region in general. <b>The</b> <b>peninsula</b> was shaped into its current form over several {{geological}} eras with the tectonic merging of Paleozoic schist formations, Mesozoic limestone and marble deposits, and finally the accretion of large clays and other sediments during the Neogene period. This is partly because of Turkey's unstable fault block terrain, and because of the close proximity of the Anatolian-Aegean plate boundary, which generates massifs of mountains all across western Turkey. This includes <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> and the mountains surrounding the Büyük Menderes River, known collectively as the Menderes Massif.|$|E

5|$|After the Union rout at Bull Run, {{the first}} major battle of the Civil War, and the {{retirement}} of the aged Winfield Scott in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general-in-chief of all the Union armies. McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his Peninsula Campaign, longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to <b>the</b> <b>peninsula</b> and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops {{in defense of the}} capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of <b>the</b> <b>Peninsula</b> Campaign.|$|E
