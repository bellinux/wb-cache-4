40|$|Simulation-based {{image quality}} metrics are adapted and {{investigated}} for characterizing the parameter dependences of linear iterative image reconstruction for DBT. Three metrics based on 2 D DBT simulation are investigated: (1) a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) between the <b>test</b> <b>phantom</b> and reconstructed image, (2) a gradient RMSE where {{the comparison is}} made after taking a spatial gradient of both image and phantom, and (3) a region-of-interest (ROI) Hotelling observer (HO) for signal-known-exactly/background-known-exactly (SKE/BKE) and signal-known-exactly/background-known-statistically (SKE/BKS) detection tasks. Two simulation studies are performed using the aforementioned metrics, varying voxel aspect ratio and regularization strength for two types of Tikhonov regularized least-squares optimization. The RMSE metrics are applied to a 2 D <b>test</b> <b>phantom</b> and the ROI-HO metric is applied to two tasks relevant to DBT: large, low contrast lesion detection and small, high contrast microcalcification detection. The RMSE metric trends are compared with visual assessment of the reconstructed <b>test</b> <b>phantom.</b> The ROI-HO metric trends are compared with 3 D reconstructed images from ACR phantom data acquired with a Hologic Selenia Dimensions DBT system. Sensitivity of image RMSE to mean pixel value is found to limit its applicability to the assessment of DBT image reconstruction. Image gradient RMSE is insensitive to mean pixel value and appears to track better with subjective visualization of the reconstructed bar-pattern phantom. The ROI-HO metric shows an increasing trend with regularization strength for both forms of Tikhonov-regularized least-squares; however, this metric saturates at intermediate regularization strength indicating a point of diminishing returns for signal detection. Visualization with reconstructed ACR phantom images appears to show a similar dependence with regularization strength. Comment: The manuscript has been submitted to Medical Physic...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem with}} CT guided biopsies {{is the high}} dosage of {{radiation}} exposure to the patient, {{the time it takes}} to perform the procedure and the lack of spatial reference of the operator. We approach this problem by using a system comprising of two digital infrared sensitive cameras and a high intensity infrared illuminator which was used to capture the coordinates of an infrared reflective tape attached to a coaxial biopsy needle having been inserted into a <b>test</b> <b>phantom.</b> Data was sent in real-time to a computer where the infrared needle position coordinates were recorded. A CT scan of the <b>test</b> <b>phantom</b> was then taken and the DICOM CT image coordinates of the needle were also recorded. The approach is to use a linear least-squares model to map points from each camera to a single point on each DICOM CT image resulting from the CT scan. Results show a promising mapping accuracy with limited data. The contribution of this paper is to show that a passive infrared imaging system using at least two cameras may be suitable for the needle estimation task in two dimensions which would allow real-time needle placement in any plane. ...|$|E

There are, however, rare diagnostic methods for the functional gastrointestinal disorders because functional disorders show no evidence of organic and physical causes.

40|$|Described is a {{fractional}} harmonic excitation (FHE) technique {{suitable for}} imaging using ultrasound bipolar square-wave excitations. The technique differs from conventional imaging techniques as the transducer is excited using a harmonic within the excitation signal, {{as opposed to}} using the fundamental signal. As a consequence, the fundamental frequency of the FHE signal is designed at a fraction (1 / 3) of the intended output frequency. The advantages of the technique include a reduction in required output switching frequency and artificial extension of transmitter bandwidth. The technique is also capable of generating frequency modulated ‘chirp’ signals. Disadvantages of the technique include reduced output pressure due to excitation by a signal harmonic and potential for transducer heating. The work demonstrates that exciting the transducer in this fashion can produce coded and non-coded images. This is verified by imaging two non-destructive <b>test</b> <b>phantoms</b> using a custom imaging system (UARP, University of Leeds, UK) ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{correlate}} diagnostic accuracy for proximal caries with perceptibility of low contrast image details using regression analysis. The other {{purpose was}} to determine the attenuation range required for proximal caries diagnosis. Methods: The results of the two types of observer performance tests described above were retrieved from previous studies. Recording media included in those studies were the Compuray and the Dixel, direct digital radiographic systems, and Ektaspeed Plus film. The average numbers of perceptibility of image details from five observers were calculated for each step and for every combination of contiguous steps of the aluminium <b>test</b> <b>phantom</b> from the perceptibility test. The average diagnostic accuracy for proximal caries from the same five observers was correlated with the total number of perceptible details from the phantom using regression analysis. Finally, attenuation range required for proximal caries diagnosis was calculated from the attenuation range of the phantom where the maximum correlation coefficient was obtained. Results: Maximum correlation (r = 0. 68) was obtained at the combination of five contiguous steps of the aluminium <b>test</b> <b>phantom.</b> Attenuation range required for proximal caries diagnosis corresponded to the 2 mm to 6 mm thickness of aluminium with acrylic block of 12 mm thickness. Conclusions: There is a correlation between perceptibility of low contrast image details and diagnostic accuracy for proximal caries. There may be a possibility to simplify observer performance tests for proximal caries diagnosis by using the standardized phantom simulating its attenuation range. © 2005 The British Institute of Radiology. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

30|$|No current single imaging {{technique}} can identify both iron and carbon-based inks at depths within cartonnage. In order {{to detect and}} ultimately read text within cartonnage a multimodal imaging approach is required, but this will, necessarily, be limited by cost, access to imaging systems, and the portability of both the system and the cartonnage. The additional challenges of imaging writing within ancient cartonnage compared to the <b>test</b> <b>phantoms</b> include a more complex geometry, overlying structures such as plaster, adhesives and paint, {{and the presence of}} mixtures of inks. It will, therefore, be important to begin by imaging the internal structure with XMT, which will assist with the interpretation of other imaging methods. Ideally, a combination of multispectral {{imaging technique}}s would then be employed for surface inks or paints, and X-ray fluorescence imaging for deeper iron-based inks (which would not necessarily require a synchrotron). At the moment, there cannot be confidence that deeper carbon-based inks can be detected, although optimised THz systems may allow this in future.|$|R

This technique is {{better suited for}} quantitative multiparameter optical measurements than the widely used pulsed-laser photothermal radiometry (PPTR) because {{of the availability of}} two independent signal channels, amplitude and phase, and the superior signal-to-noise ratio provided by synchronous lock-in detection. A rigorous three-dimensional (3 -D) thermal-wave formulation with a 3 -D diffuse and coherent photon-density-wave source is applied to data from model phantoms.
