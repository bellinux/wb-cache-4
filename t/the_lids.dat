5|$|Objects {{connected}} with death, in particular sarcophagi and cinerary urns, {{form the basis}} of much of current knowledge of the ancient Etruscan civilization and its art, which once competed with the culture of ancient Rome, but was eventually absorbed into it. The sarcophagi and <b>the</b> <b>lids</b> of the urns often incorporate a reclining image of the deceased. The reclining figures in some Etruscan funerary art are shown using the mano cornuta to protect the grave.|$|E
25|$|CPEO is a slowly {{progressing}} disease. It {{may begin}} {{at any age}} and progresses {{over a period of}} 5–15 years. The first presenting symptom of ptosis is often unnoticed by the patient until <b>the</b> <b>lids</b> droop to the point of producing a visual field defect. Often, patients will tilt the head backwards to adjust for the slowly progressing ptosis of <b>the</b> <b>lids.</b> In addition, as the ptosis becomes complete, the patients will use the frontalis (forehead) muscle to help elevate <b>the</b> <b>lids.</b> The ptosis is typically bilateral, but may be unilateral for a period of months to years before the fellow lid becomes involved.|$|E
25|$|If left untreated, {{more serious}} {{complications}} could result, including birth defects in pregnancy, {{increased risk of}} a miscarriage, bone mineral loss, and in extreme cases, death. Graves' disease is often accompanied {{by an increase in}} heart rate, which may lead to further heart complications, including loss of the normal heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), which may lead to stroke. If the eyes are proptotic (bulging) enough that <b>the</b> <b>lids</b> do not close completely at night, dryness will occur with a risk of a secondary corneal infection which could lead to blindness. Pressure on the optic nerve behind the globe can lead to visual field defects and vision loss, as well. Prolonged untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to bone loss, which may resolve when treated.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{internally}} fitted <b>lid</b> design employs an oval lid that {{is placed}} inside and presses outward; the user inserts <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> at an angle, then turns <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> to align {{it with the}} pot opening on top because <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> {{is larger than the}} opening. A spring arrangement holds <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> in place until the pressure forms and holds <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> tightly against <b>the</b> body, preventing removal until the pressure is released.|$|R
50|$|The gimmick of {{the dove}} pan {{lies in the}} design of <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b> <b>The</b> deep {{shouldered}} rim of <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> conceals an additional pan (or liner) that fits snugly into the main pan. When <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> is placed on the pan the liner is deposited inside it, resembling the main pan when it was displayed empty. The liner, when fitted into <b>the</b> <b>lid,</b> may be loaded with birds (or anything else the magician wishes to produce) before the trick begins.

25|$|It is {{customary}} to eat rice to {{the last}} grain. Being a picky eater is frowned upon, {{and it is not}} customary to ask for special requests or substitutions at restaurants. It is considered ungrateful to make these requests especially in circumstances where one is being hosted, as in a business dinner environment. After eating, try to move all dishes back to the same position they were {{at the start of the}} meal. This includes replacing <b>the</b> <b>lids</b> on dishes and putting one's chopsticks on the chopstick holder or back into their paper slip. Good manners dictate that one respects the selections of the host. However, this can be set aside for a diner with allergies such as a peanut allergy, or a religious prohibition against certain foods like pork.|$|E
25|$|Many plastic {{items for}} medical or {{laboratory}} use {{can be made}} from polypropylene because it can withstand the heat in an autoclave. Its heat resistance also enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade kettles. Food containers made from it will not melt in the dishwasher, and do not melt during industrial hot filling processes. For this reason, most plastic tubs for dairy products are polypropylene sealed with aluminum foil (both heat-resistant materials). After the product has cooled, the tubs are often given lids made of a less heat-resistant material, such as LDPE or polystyrene. Such containers provide a good hands-on example of the difference in modulus, since the rubbery (softer, more flexible) feeling of LDPE with respect to polypropylene of the same thickness is readily apparent. Rugged, translucent, reusable plastic containers made {{in a wide variety of}} shapes and sizes for consumers from various companies such as Rubbermaid and Sterilite are commonly made of polypropylene, although <b>the</b> <b>lids</b> are often made of somewhat more flexible LDPE so they can snap on to the container to close it. Polypropylene can also be made into disposable bottles to contain liquid, powdered, or similar consumer products, although HDPE and polyethylene terephthalate are commonly also used to make bottles. Plastic pails, car batteries, wastebaskets, pharmacy prescription bottles, cooler containers, dishes and pitchers are often made of polypropylene or HDPE, both of which commonly have rather similar appearance, feel, and properties at ambient temperature.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, {{the large}} Lusatian urn fields were {{replaced}} by small, family size burial sites with several or more urns. The cist graves were now mostly flat, without mounds, forming a rectangle with up to two meter-long sides built of vertical slabs, containing the urns (sometimes as many as thirty and in separate compartments) inside and covered with another slab. Further south and east, as the Pomeranian culture expanded into central and southeastern Poland, there were also burials where the urn was placed under a globe or cloche, that is inside a large, spherical ceramic container, itself sometimes placed in a cist; areas with this arrangement are sometimes recognized as a distinct subculture (Cloche Grave culture). Two types of funerary urns are peculiar to the Pomeranians, house-urns and face-urns. House-urns stand on several legs, have a large opening in front, come from an earlier period, the 7–6th century BC and mostly from the Lębork region. Face-urns {{from the same period}} are round, bulging containers with a unique and often realistic image of a face around the neck area and a hat-like lid, while the later ones tend to be less elaborate. Sometimes on the outside they were variously decorated, with tools and toilet accessories placed inside. Face-urns from the 650–450 BC period unearthed in Borucino, Kartuzy County and elsewhere present a rich assortment of engraved narrative scenes. Those include horse-drawn chariots that apparently depict the nightly trips of the sun-god through the underworlds, which symbolically represents the cyclical renewal of life; carts pulled by oxen and representing lunar symbolism are also present. Solar images were placed on <b>the</b> <b>lids.</b> House- and face-urns are believed to represent Etruscan influence.|$|E
50|$|The {{butterfly}} keyboard {{is split}} into two roughly triangular pieces that slide as <b>the</b> laptop's <b>lid</b> is opened or closed. As <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> is opened both pieces slide out to the sides, followed by one piece sliding downward. The two halves mesh to form a keyboard 29.2 cm (11.5 in) wide which overhangs {{the sides of the}} laptop body. Conversely, as <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> is closed one piece slides back, then both slide inward until the keyboard can be covered by <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b> <b>The</b> movement of the keyboard is driven by a cam on <b>the</b> <b>lid's</b> hinge, so <b>the</b> motions of the keyboard parts are always synchronized with the movement of <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b>|$|R
30|$|Our {{analysis}} {{suggests that the}} stresses in <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> increase approximately as a square of {{the distance from the}} bottom of <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> (Equation 34 and Figure 14). This agrees with the asymptotic analysis of Fowler (1985) but is different from the stress distribution in Solomatov (2004 a). In Solomatov (2004 a), the stress distribution was more complex because the convective cell was heated from within rather than from the bottom and the internal heating affected the temperature-induced density distribution in <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b> At Rayleigh numbers higher than those reached in Solomatov (2004 a), <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> is expected to become sufficiently thin so that the heat production inside <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> would be negligible compared to the heat flux at the base of <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b> Thus, we expect that for convection with internal heating, the stress distribution in <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> should approach <b>the</b> quadratic distribution that we observe for convection with bottom heating.|$|R
30|$|In {{agreement}} with Fowler (1985), {{we have shown}} that <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> slope is {{a key factor in}} determining the stresses in <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b> However, our model has several important differences from Fowler (1985). The theoretical solution in Fowler (1985) is a similarity solution and does not take into the finite horizontal extent of <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b> Our model has vertical boundaries, and thus, the structure of <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> in our model is more complex. Also, the solution in Fowler (1985) is an asymptotic solution requiring very high values of parameters, such as Ra and θ, and a satisfaction of certain asymptotic conditions, which are not reached in our simulations and may not necessarily be reached on planets. Thus, our scaling laws are not asymptotic in this sense. Also, solutions in Fowler (1985) are obtained for two end-member cases, <b>the</b> large <b>lid</b> slope case, and <b>the</b> small <b>lid</b> slope case. We find that <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> slope behaves in a more complex way and is between these two end-member cases. We have determined a scaling law for <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> slope numerically and used it to derive the scaling law for the stresses in <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Crocodiles {{have very}} good night vision, and are mostly nocturnal hunters. They use the {{disadvantage}} of most prey animals' poor nocturnal vision to their advantage. The light receptors in crocodilians’ eyes include cones and numerous rods, so it is assumed all crocodilians can see colours. Crocodiles have vertical-slit shaped pupils, {{similar to those of}} domestic cats. One explanation for the evolution of slit pupils is that they exclude light more effectively than a circular pupil, helping to protect the eyes during daylight. On the rear wall of the eye is a tapetum lucidum, which reflects incoming light back onto the retina, thus utilizing the small amount of light available at night to best advantage. In addition to the protection of the upper and lower eyelids, crocodiles have a nictitating membrane (sometimes called a [...] "third eye-lid") that can be drawn over the eye from the inner corner while <b>the</b> <b>lids</b> are open. The eyeball surface is thus protected under the water while a certain degree of vision is still possible.|$|E
