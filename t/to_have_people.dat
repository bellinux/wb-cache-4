5|$|For the sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, {{producer}} Kitase {{thought that}} the greatest fan expectation was for the reunion of Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game. The game generated rumors about Tidus' connection with the villain, Shuyin, who was physically similar and had the same actors. Square responded that such a storyline, given Tidus' nature, would be too complicated. For the remastering of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, producer Kitase's motivation was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> {{too young to have}} played the games experience them; his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} a remaster {{originated}} from a reunion of the games' original development team and voice cast during the making of Final Fantasy Type-0. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura, associate producer Hideki Imaizumi and a voice actor thought that they should create something to celebrate the tenth anniversary of X. Producer Yoshinori Kitase's personal motivation was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> {{too young to have}} played the games experience them, as his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel. Another reason was that many did not have an opportunity to play the games since they were not compatible with the majority of PlayStation 3 models and neither available on the PlayStation Network unlike games from the original PlayStation like Final Fantasy VII and IX. Nomura entered negotiations with other old members of staff and got a remaster of X and X-2 approved, but the actual development process was delayed because much of the team was still busy with the creation of Final Fantasy XIII. The remaster was first announced at Tokyo Game Show 2011, where it was assumed that the game would release to commemorate Xs tenth anniversary.|$|E
25|$|It was {{especially}} {{during this time}} that African Americans began forming their own churches, {{in part because of}} the unequal treatment they were facing in integrated churches in both the North and the South.

50|$|Opposition to the {{movement}} came from {{organizations such as the}} Federal Electoral Institute, a government institute who seeks to expand voter participation, who claimed that the response to an unsatisfactory democracy is not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fewer <b>people</b> vote but <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more <b>people</b> involved in the electoral process.|$|R

Dede starts <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> on his side (including Tamuno, who was a dedicated police officer) after an incident in which the Army invades their village and rapes their women, {{right in front of}} them. Ebiere continues with her protests while Dede forms a militant group, showing their displeasure through violence, vandalism and kidnapping Western Oil officials. Western Oil eventually convinces Ebiere (who is now Dede's love interest) to help ask Dede and his group for dialogue with government. It {{turns out to be a}} ploy to get them arrested. A shoot-out occurs, leading to Dede and his group being killed.|$|E
500|$|This {{outcome was}} the subject of {{controversy}} in Romania, where the territorial exchange was generally considered unfair, with some voices even arguing that the country could again accept Ottoman suzerainty as a means to overturn the state of affairs. Unbeknown to them, the Budjak cession had been secretly agreed upon with Nelidov in early 1877. Even then, against his subordinates in the diplomatic corps, but in consonance with the Domnitor, Kogălniceanu privately noted that he [...] "fully agreed" [...] with it, and that he regarded the new province as a [...] "splendid acquisition". However, in April 1877, Kogălniceanu had explicitly assured Parliament that no real threat loomed over the Budjak. By that point in time, both the Germans and the Austrians had begun suspecting that Kogălniceanu was in fact a favorite and agent of influence of the Russians, and, reportedly, he even encouraged the rumor to spread. Andrássy reportedly commented: [...] "Prince Carol is really unfortunate <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> like Mr. Kogălniceanu in his service".|$|E
500|$|Matt Groening first {{conceived}} Marge and {{the rest}} of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show, and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip. When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights, Groening decided to go in another direction and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his own family. Marge was named after Groening's mother Margaret [...] "Marge" [...] Groening, who has said she bears little similarity to the character, stating, [...] "It's really weird <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> think you're a cartoon." [...] Marge's beehive hairstyle was inspired by the titular Bride in Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although her hair was never blue.|$|E

500|$|Feldmann {{felt it was}} a {{challenge}} to work with a new version of Blink-182 while both keeping its legacy and moving the group into a new territory. Feldmann's [...] "agenda was to have an album that was palatable for a generation of ADD kids." [...] The band members and Feldmann felt a breakthrough in direction with the song [...] "Cynical", which they immediately chose as the opening song on the album. According to Hoppus, the band recorded a total of nearly 50 songs. By mid-February, the album was [...] "70–80%" [...] complete, according to Barker, and work was reportedly completed in early March 2016. By the end of March, the group were still narrowing down the songs that would be present on the album. The trio posted their progress via their respective social media accounts during the recording, in the form of Snapchat and Instagram clips. All parties seemed satisfied with the record. While recording, Barker told an interviewer that [...] "It's honestly the best material we've written or put out in years. I haven't been excited about a Blink album like this in a long time." [...] Feldmann commented, [...] "I'm just so excited <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> hear it. I'd say it's one of the best records I've ever made in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Neil Pigot, who {{did some}} {{work with the}} group, {{describes}} their style as [...] "a sort of extension of the Python tradition, but very much in an Australian context." [...] He says that DAAS were [...] "crucially important" [...] {{in the development of}} Australian comedy, directly contributing to the styles of successful comedy shows such as The D-Generation, Fast Forward and Wogs Out of Work. At the time DAAS emerged, Pigot says, comedy in Australia was dominated by joke-tellers and impersonators. [...] By contrast, DAAS were belligerent and confrontational, frequently attacking topical issues, invading people's personal space and involving the audience in their act. Mark Trevorrow, who frequently collaborated with the group, described their work as [...] "true genius." [...] "Their great shows were among the greatest evenings I've witnessed in my life and their worst shows were among the worst," [...] he said. [...] "They'd whip up an audience and appeal to people's darker side. [...] It was very Dada, what they were doing. [...] And what happens with that is you're just as often likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> who want to kill you as applaud you." [...] In addition, ABC comedy producer Ted Robinson says that the group {{played an important role in}} raising the profile of Australian comedy overseas, particularly in Britain where DAAS were very popular. British comedian Al Murray said of seeing the group at the Edinburgh Festival in 1988, [...] "they came onstage with the attitude of feral invaders and left it with no taboo untouched." [...] Murray described the All Stars as [...] "an insanely hot act from Oz who sang, cursed, sweated and insulted each other and their audiences with a level of commitment and polish that seemed exotically charged and almost transgressive in the late 80s." ...|$|E

His point was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> {{look at the}} urinal {{as if it were}} a work of art, because he said it was a work of art. He referred to his work as [...] "Readymades."

Duchamp can be seen as a precursor to conceptual art. Some critics question calling Duchamp—whose obsession with paradox is well known—postmodernist on the grounds he eschews any specific medium, since paradox is not medium-specific, although it arose first in Manet's paintings.|$|E
