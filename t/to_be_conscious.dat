25|$|Awareness: {{the state}} or ability to perceive, to feel, or <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> of events, objects, or sensory patterns. In this level of consciousness, sense data can be {{confirmed}} by an observer without necessarily implying understanding. More broadly, it is {{the state or}} quality of being aware of something. In biological psychology, awareness {{is defined as a}} human's or an animal's perception and cognitive reaction to a condition or event.|$|E

Also, the accident resulted in temporary retroactive and progressive amnesia.

Such questions become a lifelong endeavor for Boring to try to answer.|$|E

25|$|Colin McGinn {{argues that}} the Chinese room {{provides}} strong evidence that the hard problem of consciousness is fundamentally insoluble.

It is simply not possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, {{during the}} campaigns of World War I, Lecca was a Captain of the Ammunition Department in the 22nd Division, which withdrew {{with the rest}} of the army into Western Moldavia. Also during that interval, a revue of his, Dandanaua ("The Mishap") was being staged by Maximilian in German-occupied Bucharest—it was {{cancelled}} after reports that it was mocking the occupiers. While recovering at Podu Iloaiei in winter 1916, Lecca showed signs of a debilitating illness (sometimes described as a war injury), confessing to Ludovic Dauș that he was slowly dying, but still hoping to find a miracle cure. Decommissioned in summer 1917, he was living in Iași, with Natalia Lecca as his nurse. Among his last works was another volume of poetry, Simpla ("The Simple One"). Almost completely paralyzed in 1918, he continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> and responsive although, as Iorgulescu recalls, he was socially dead.|$|E
25|$|A {{positive}} correlation between minorities and a socio economic status of being low income in industrialized and rural regions of the U.S. depict how low income communities tend to include more individuals that have a lower educational background, most importantly in health. Income status, diet, and education all construct a higher burden for low income minorities, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> about their health. Research conducted by medical departments at universities in San diego, Miami, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina suggested that minorities in regions where lower socioeconomic status is common, there was a direct relationship with unhealthy diets and greater distance of supermarkets. Therefore, in areas where supermarkets are less accessible (food deserts) to impoverished areas, the more likely these groups are to purchase inexpensive fast food or just follow an unhealthy diet. As a result, because food deserts are more prevalent in low income communities, minorities that reside in these areas are more prone obesity, {{which can lead to}} diseases such as chronic kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes.|$|E

25|$|Promoting {{independence}} in self-care can provide {{older adults with}} the capability to maintain independence longer and can leave them {{with a sense of}} achievement when they complete a task unaided. Older adults that require assistance with activities of daily living are at a greater risk of losing their independence with self-care tasks as dependent personal behaviours are often met with reinforcement from caregivers. It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status in an older adult that has physical limitations. Caregivers need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> of actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform self-care may allow them to see the benefit in performing self-care independently. If the older adult is able to complete self-care activities on their own, or even if they need supervision, encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence can provide them with a sense of accomplishment and the ability to maintain independence longer.|$|E
25|$|It is only by {{maintaining}} such a continual vigilance that the sociologists can spot {{themselves in the}} act of importing their own biases into their work. Reflexivity is, therefore, a kind of additional stage in the scientific epistemology. It is not enough for the scientist to go through the usual stages (research, hypothesis, falsification, experiment, repetition, peer review, etc.); Bourdieu recommends also that the scientist purge their work of the prejudices likely to derive from their social position. In a good illustration of the process, Bourdieu chastises academics (including himself) for judging their students' work against a rigidly scholastic linguistic register, favouring students whose writing appears 'polished', marking down those guilty of 'vulgarity'. Without a reflexive analysis of the snobbery being deployed under the cover of those subjective terms, the academic will unconsciously reproduce a degree of class prejudice, promoting the student with high linguistic capital and holding back the student who lacks it — not because of the objective quality of the work but simply because of the register in which it is written. Reflexivity should enable the academic <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> of their prejudices, e.g. for apparently sophisticated writing, and impel them to take steps to correct for this bias.|$|E

500|$|In {{what has}} been {{described}} by Jenneke Arens as a deliberate attempt to destroy an ethnic group, many of those assaulted were raped, murdered and then bayoneted in the genitalia. Adam Jones, a political scientist, has said {{that one of the reasons}} for the mass rapes was to undermine Bengali society through the [...] "dishonoring" [...] of Bengali women and that some women were raped until they died or were killed following repeated attacks. The Pakistani army also raped Bengali males. The men, when passing through a checkpoint, would be ordered to prove they were circumcised, and this is where the rapes usually happened. The International Commission of Jurists concluded that the atrocities carried out by the Pakistan armed forces [...] "were part of a deliberate policy by a disciplined force". The writer Mulk Raj Anand said of the Pakistani army actions, [...] "The rapes were so systematic and pervasive that they had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>conscious</b> Army policy, [...] "planned by the West Pakistanis in a deliberate effort to create a new race" [...] or to dilute Bengali nationalism".

500|$|The {{earliest}} English language uses of [...] "conscious" [...] and [...] "consciousness" [...] date back, however, to the 1500s. [...] The English word [...] "conscious" [...] originally {{derived from}} the Latin conscius (con- [...] "together" [...] and [...] "to know"), but the Latin word {{did not have the}} same meaning as our word—it meant [...] "knowing with", in other words [...] "having joint or common knowledge with another". [...] There were, however, many occurrences in Latin writings of the phrase conscius sibi, which translates literally as [...] "knowing with oneself", or in other words [...] "sharing knowledge with oneself about something". [...] This phrase had the figurative meaning of [...] "knowing that one knows", as the modern English word [...] "conscious" [...] does. [...] In its earliest uses in the 1500s, the English word [...] "conscious" [...] retained the meaning of the Latin conscius. [...] For example, Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan wrote: [...] "Where two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>Conscious</b> of it one to another." [...] The Latin phrase conscius sibi, whose meaning was more closely related to the current concept of consciousness, was rendered in English as [...] "conscious to oneself" [...] or [...] "conscious unto oneself". [...] For example, Archbishop Ussher wrote in 1613 of [...] "being so conscious unto myself of my great weakness". [...] Locke's definition from 1690 illustrates that a gradual shift in meaning had taken place.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} contributions to this question was an essay written in 1950 by pioneering computer scientist Alan Turing, titled Computing Machinery and Intelligence. [...] Turing disavowed any interest in terminology, saying that even [...] "Can machines think?" [...] is too loaded with spurious connotations to be meaningful; but he proposed to replace all such questions with a specific operational test, which has become known as the Turing test. [...] To pass the test, a computer must be able to imitate a human well enough to fool interrogators. In his essay Turing discussed a variety of possible objections, and presented a counterargument to each of them. [...] The Turing test is commonly cited in discussions of artificial intelligence as a proposed criterion for machine consciousness; it has provoked a great deal of philosophical debate. For example, Daniel Dennett and Douglas Hofstadter argue that anything capable of passing the Turing test is necessarily conscious, while David Chalmers argues that a philosophical zombie could pass the test, yet fail <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>conscious.</b> A third group of scholars have argued that with technological growth once machines begin to display any substantial signs of human-like behavior then the dichotomy (of human consciousness compared to human-like consciousness) becomes passé and issues of machine autonomy begin to prevail even as observed in its nascent form within contemporary industry and technology. Jürgen Schmidhuber argues that consciousness is simply the result of compression. As an agent sees representation of itself recurring in the environment, the compression of this representation can be called consciousness.|$|E

40|$|The article {{attempts}} to analyze sustainable product strategy in apparel industry specifically addressing {{a firm that}} is considering launching a sustainable product partly made from recycled materials. There {{are two types of}} consumers under consideration, environmentally conscious and regular consumers, as they have different perceived values for the sustainable products. The article provides an analytical model aimed to identify conditions under which a firm could benefit from adopting sustainable product strategy. The level of sustainability is determined by the trade-off between profitability and costs occurred and if more consumers value sustainable products, the firm will increase its sustainable level and get a higher profit. This is because of a combination effect of an increasing marginal profit and demand expansion. Moreover, the model has <b>been</b> further extended <b>to</b> address a situation where the firm could manage consumer segmentation. Depending on parameter settings, the firm may target different consumer segments and there is always a threshold of cost for managing consumer segments. When converting regular consumers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> environmentally <b>conscious</b> <b>is</b> not costly, the firm will convert all consumers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> environmentally <b>conscious</b> with great efforts; otherwise, the firm will convert part of consumers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> environmentally <b>conscious...</b>|$|R
