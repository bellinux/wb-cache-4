40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present and analyse the {{regulatory}} issues emerging from the newly launched programme of rural electricity access in India. We focus on two broad areas, namely regulatory issues related to the organisation/structuring of the activities and issues related to subsidy and tariffs. The paper looks into the alternative organisational arrangements being used by the programme and identifies problem areas through a responsibility mapping. The <b>tariff</b> <b>principle</b> being followed by the programme is then analysed considering the alternative organisational forms and issues related to such pricing policies are identified. Possible alternative pricing options are then suggested. The paper finds that while the franchisee model is an innovative idea, it raises issues that the regulators should be concerned with. The programme has so far relied on the simplest franchisee model because of its ease of implementation but a transition to more complex alternatives would require careful considerations.

40|$|At {{the recent}} Financial Times Conference on Telecommunications and the European Business Market: the Perspectives for Change, {{two of the}} {{contributors}} examined {{the question of whether}} companies should "make" their own private telecommunications network, or "buy" a publicly-offered service. The topic is not only interesting as a case study of "make or buy", but is especially timely in the specific field of telecommunications in Europe. In June 1987, the European Commission issued its Green Paper on telecommunications liberalisation and rationalisation of Europe's equipment manufacturers. Current difficulties include national regulatory powers, cross subsidies, lack of common standards, and lack of agreement on standards, frequencies and <b>tariff</b> <b>principles.</b> Not least, rapid changes in the technology itself has turned telecommunications into a Strategic competitive asset for companies. The two authors of these articles argue from slightly different perspectives; White as a major user developing into a provider, and Wilson as an adviser and provider. Both are convinced that the make or buy decision is an over-simplification; there are other, intermediate, options. Both agree that which ever decision is taken, {{it is likely to be}} the most important one in information technology that companies make in the next few years. ...|$|R
40|$|Artículos en revistasElectricity {{production}} from centralised and decentralised renewable energy resources in Europe is gaining significance, resulting in operational {{challenges in the}} electricity system. Although these challenges add to the locational and time dependency of the underlying cost of operating the system, this variability in time and location is not reflected in residential tariff schemes. Consequently, residential users are not incentivised to react to varying system conditions and to help the integration of renewable energy resources. Therefore, this paper provides a theoretical framework for designing a locational dynamic pricing scheme. This {{can be used to}} assess existing tariff structures for consumption and injection, and can serve as a theoretical background for developing new tariff schemes. Starting from the underlying costs, this paper shows that the potential for locational dynamic pricing depends on the locational and time dependency of its cost drivers. When converting costs into tariffs, the tariff design should be determined. This includes the advance notice of sending tariffs to users, and the length of price blocks and price patterns. This tariff design should find a balance between <b>tariff</b> <b>principles</b> related to costs, practicality and social acceptability on the one hand, and the resulting demand response incentive on the other. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|This survey paper {{analyses}} some of {{the fundamental}} economic and management science issues concerning the communications and information economy,with special emphasis on mobile communications. Are first highlighted major trends such as the balkanisation of the communications networks, {{and the advent of}} competitive tariffs. This leads to a move away from time and distance based charges to tariffs covering bandwidth, service, and contents use. It is noted that very few resources have gone into the analysis of that sector and its inter-relations with others. The paper advocates for more visibility and research into the unique aspects of the communications and information sector. It does so by making an inventory of key economics,management, and computational economics research issues in need of contributions, selected from the following areas: public communications infrastructure and <b>tariffing</b> <b>principles,</b> sales of communications services, public access and equal access policies, competitive access pricing, communications industry finance, engineering-economic studies, information contents and macroeconomic issues. Finally, the specific aspects of models of the communications and media sector are addressed in view of modelling work. This includes variables, pricing and production models for both communications and information contents. The most unique contribution is here a formal model for quantifying and pricing knowledge, both for consumption and for assets building. telecommunications;mobile communications;tariffs;knowledge bases;public access;content...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} {{flexibility}} within power system operation is growing as more intermittent renewables with limited controllability are integrated. While traditionally this need is met by supply side resources, the demand side also has intrinsic flexibility available {{which could be}} tapped, {{often referred to as}} demand response. Although policy makers and industry recognize the value of demand response, its use and understanding remains limited. This is especially the case on the residential level. This thesis aims at enhancing the understanding of demand response by addressing three knowledge gaps, ranging from designing dynamic tariff schemes to incentivize demand response, over quantifying the residential load modifications these cause, until determining the final benefits this brings for households and society as a whole. First of all, the demand response incentive following from the current residential tariff designs is limited especially in view of more renewable energy resources. Moreover, these tariffs dont reflect the time-dependency of the underlying cost of electricity. In order to allow demand response and to reflect actual costs to the users, this thesis argues a balance has to be found between <b>tariff</b> <b>principles</b> related to costs and social acceptability {{on the one hand and}} its resulting demand response incentive on the other. This balance can be accomplished by proper tariff design. It is shown that the choice of the tariff design not only affects the demand response incentive, but also the resulting benefits. Second, the magnitude to which residential users react to those tariff schemes remains largely unknown. This thesis shows that flexibility obtained from both wet appliances and battery electric vehicles is considerable. Moreover, automation adds to the level and predictability of demand response. Hereby, predictability can be reached by means of price elasticities. Finally, the benefits residential demand response brings to power system operation are not properly identified. This thesis shows that demand response leads to operational benefits as costs of plant operation decrease, while enhancing system reliability. Moreover, demand response proves to be an efficient means to integrate intermittent renewable energy resources. On the investment side, demand response leads to a postponement and reduction of the need for additional generation capacity. status: publishe...|$|R

The basic tariff is calculated on the basis of economic costs according to a methodology defined at the national level by CRA (Law 287 of 2004). Therefore, in <b>principle,</b> <b>tariffs</b> in different municipalities do not differ due to local government’s decisions to raise tariffs or not, but only because of the different costs of the services.|$|R
40|$|A 2014 {{decision}} by the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) obliges electricity distributors in the National Electricity Market (NEM) to develop new electricity tariffs. These tariffs must be cost reflective – that is, the prices distributors charge must reflect “the efficient costs of providing network services to each consumer. ” Cost reflective pricing is a complex topic, but network tariff reform will significantly change the way distributors charge for energy. This will affect retail electricity plans. The effects on consumers’ bills are still uncertain, but the time to put views forward in the process is now. CUAC’s report {{is designed to help}} consumers, consumer advocates, and community groups engage with electricity distribution businesses and policy makers in their development and implementation of cost reflective tariffs. Cost Reflective Pricing: Engaging with Network Tariff Reform in Victoria explains the regulatory background to network tariff reform, the economic concepts underpinning cost reflective pricing, and the different components that might be combined to form a cost reflective tariff. The report summarises current Victorian distributor tariff proposals and research into the effects of different tariffs on different consumers, and well as proposing an implementation model for cost reflective <b>tariffs.</b> The <b>principles</b> of the report are relevant to all states in the NEM (Queensland, NSW, ACT, Victoria, SA, Tasmania) ...|$|R

The WTO is assumed as an arbitrator for the exchange in an oligopolistic industry and sets tariff rules according to the SDT principles; a firm's cost is private information both for the WTO and the foreign rivalries. Subsequent to our analysis of several cases we find that a firm may misreport to the WTO for more production revenue and the government may collude with a firm for higher welfare. It is shown that the misreporting and collusion incentives {{are related to the}} WTO tariff rule, the misreported cost and market size. Furthermore, a strategy proof tariff rule has been designed in which firms can never make his revenue better off by misreporting production cost.

40|$|In this paper, {{the author}} studies water supply tariffs setting schemes, the {{structure}} of the tariffs, and other issues related to this process. The target was set to study water supply <b>tariffs</b> regulation <b>principles</b> both in Latvia and in the European Union aiming to set forward solutions for optimisation of tariff-setting processes. The following tasks were set forward for reaching the target: 1. studying theoretical aspects of public utilities regulation and the setting of tariffs, 2. evaluation of tariffs structure in Latvia and Lithuania, 3. finding out and analysing the principal factors of tariffs increase, 4. ellaboration of a new solution for the optimisation of the tariffs setting process. Scientific research methods and materials: 1) scientific deduction method when analysing theory on the issue studied; 2) scientific induction method when summarising study research results, evaluations, conclusions, suggestions; 3) dynamic time series analyses aiming at finding out development progress and rate of processes, facts and costs; 4) graphical method when visualising data surveyed and executed; 5) data grouping and dynamic analyses method has been applied for the analyses of the statistical data; 6) evaluation of computer programmes to select the most appropriate for reaching the target set. This research paper consists of an introduction, four interrelated chapters, conclusions and proposals. The first part of the paper describes the specificity of monopoly market and the necessity of regulation of public services. In {{the second part of the}} paper the Author analysis the regulation of public utilities in water management in Latvia and Lithuania, {{the structure of}} water supply tariffs is being compared and analysed. In the third chapter the process of determining water management tariffs is being researched, in the fourth chapter – problems related to the regulation of water management tariffs have been identified. The Author mentions implementing the ESF projects as one of the reasons for tariff increase. Their impact on tariffs the Author will evaluate in her future research. Another problem that has been identified is the complicated revision and analysis process of tariff, which is rather long and demands both human and time resources. To solve the problem the Author proposes to introduce a new innovative method – the visualisation of geo-information that would allow to compare similar enterprises – public utilities providers (on similar criteria) making the process of tariff evaluation faster. Scientific research and publications by Latvian and foreign scholars, data by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Developmentof the Republic of Latvia, information by tariffs regulatory institutions in Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, theoretical and analytical literature as well as other information sources listed under the List of Literature have been used for the research. As a result of the study the Author suggests to use the software of geographic information system for the optimization of water tariffs comparison, evaluation and setting processes that would enable for visualisation option...|$|R
40|$|Ahead of the Uruguay Round accord of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in December of 1993, {{numerous}} developing countries, {{especially in}} Latin America, {{embarked on a}} process of unilateral trade liberalization. During the late 1980 s and early 1990 s, bound tariffs were instituted, export taxes removed, and quantitative restrictions replaced with <b>tariffs.</b> Although the <b>principle</b> of tariffication is now widely accepted, many policymakers in these countries are exploring temporary import restrictions in agriculture with the argument that this sector is a special case because of the major distortions in world food prices. Protection is considered {{in the form of}} additional tariff protection on importables, such as cereals in the case of Colombia and Chile. In some cases, pressure exists to revert to levels of protection in effect prior to trade policy reforms. The demand for protection has arisen {{as a result of a}} decline in internal real farm prices over the last few years. This decline can be traced mainly to two circumstances: an appreciation of the real exchange rate following a surge in net capital inflows and a global decline in world prices (Valdés 1993). Only the exchange rate appreciation can be related to a country's ongoing policy reforms. The decline in world food prices, by contrast, is part of a persistent secular trend toward lower real prices. Advocates of agricultural protection in Latin American countries, however, argue that the current decline in world food prices is mainly the result of protectionist policies of industrialized countries. Local farmers cannot be left alone to compete against the treasuries of rich industrial nations; they must be protected from artificially low world prices. This argument for protection receives its economic logic from the widespread belief among policymakers that world prices will turn sharply upware once the Uruguay Round accord (December 1993) of the GATT is fully implemented. The GATT accord will compel industrial countries to lower their rates of protection to farmers and to eliminate export subsidies over time. Protection is therefore only temporarily needed until food prices rise. Are the advocates of protection right? Are prices in world food markets only temporarily depressed? To find out, this paper assembles and evaluates the available evidence on trends in world food prices and on policy-induced price distortions. In addition, recent work on the likely effects of the Uruguay Round is surveyed. From this evidence, it appears that world food prices cannot reasonably be expected to change significantly in the future. To the extent that prices do change, they are likely to continue downward in real terms. Positive price changes will be limited to a few highly protected commodities, such as beef, dairy products, and to some extent sugar. If world food prices do not trend upward in the near future, however, then there is little economic logic behind schemes for protecting domestic farmers from low price imports. In effect, such protection would only postpone adjustment and unambiguously lower economic welfare of urban consumers, an outcome to be seriously debated before policies of protection are put in place. To avoid the pressure for protection, policymakers may instead want to emphasize measures to enhance productitivity and reduce costs. It may also be useful to develop risk-diffusing instruments to manage price risks and to improve the administrative capacity to apply safeguards and countervailing duties. ...|$|R
