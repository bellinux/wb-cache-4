5|$|During the 1920s the British {{steadily}} expanded {{control over}} the South Sudan. The Deputy governor of Mongalla, Major R.G.C. Brock, estimated that he had added 50,000 Toposa and related people to <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> of his province, a somewhat inflated figure.|$|E
5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather in the first few weeks of winter, <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> of the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E

In the 21st century, English Heritage manage the inner bailey, <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> remaining in use for farming, and the site as a whole is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|Kona lows, most extra{{tropical}} cyclones, {{and tropical}} upper tropospheric cyclones are cold core lows. In <b>the</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> {{of the north}} Pacific ocean and north Indian ocean, {{the formation of a}} weak circulation underneath a mid to upper-tropospheric low which has cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the cold season (winter) is called a subtropical cyclone. In the case of the north Indian ocean, the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season.|$|E
