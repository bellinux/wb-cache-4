50|$|The {{most basic}} {{breakdown}} of stock types is into one-piece and <b>two</b> <b>piece</b> stocks. A one piece stock {{is a single}} unit from butt to fore-end, such as that commonly found on bolt action rifles. <b>Two</b> <b>piece</b> stocks use a separate piece for the butt and fore-end, such as that commonly found on break open shotguns, and lever-action rifles and shotguns. Traditionally, <b>two</b> <b>piece</b> stocks were easier to make, since finding a wood blank suitable for a long one piece stock is harder than finding short blanks for a <b>two</b> <b>piece</b> stock.|$|R

50|$|There {{is further}} {{uncertainty}} regarding {{the author of}} the <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> in New German Tablature. Hermann Rauschning suggested that all pieces should be considered the work of Schmiedtlein, but in his own content listing of the Gdańsk Tablature considers the <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> to be just one. Franz Kessler on the hand considers these <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> to be a later addition into the manuscript and suggests these should be treated separately from the other compositions based on the different hand writing and notation system. Klaus Beckmann only considers the first forty pieces when writing about the Gdańsk Tablature or about Cajus Schmiedtlein. Jerzy Erdman appears to imply in his 1993 edition that the final <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> be considered one and publishes only one of the <b>two</b> <b>pieces,</b> but subsequently recorded both works in New German Tablature on his 1997 CD recording.|$|R

50|$|Older Weaver systems used <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> {{mounted a}} {{distance}} apart {{from one another}} typically on the receiver of a rifle over the bolt opening where the cartridge would be inserted and/or ejected. However, alignment problems of the <b>two</b> <b>piece</b> system can put undue stress on a rifle scope and cause problems between the scope and rifle barrel parallels and bullet Point Of Impact (POI). Also the <b>two</b> <b>piece</b> system must be mounted to exacting tolerances to one another to ensure perfect alignment using a scope alignment device called Alignment Sleeves. The <b>two</b> <b>piece</b> type can also be problematic when some rifles will not allow for the <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> to be mounted due to metal thickness of the receiver or other issues of receiver length that will not allow for proper distance to hold the scope. With the later one piece approach, the rail system remains consistent in alignment.|$|R

50|$|Heat fusion (sometimes called heat welding, {{butt welding}} or simply fusion) is a welding process used to join <b>two</b> {{different}} <b>pieces</b> of a thermoplastic. This process involves heating both pieces simultaneously and pressing them together. The <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> then cool together {{and form a}} permanent bond. When done properly, the <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> become indistinguishable from each other. Dissimilar plastics can result in improper bonding.|$|R

In any row or column there are five spaces since the board is a 5 x 5 square grid.|$|R

50|$|Shot welding is a {{specific}} type of spot welding used to join <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> of metal together. This is accomplished by clamping the <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> together and then passing a large electric current through them {{for a short period of}} time. Assuming the right amount of current for the right time, this will weld the <b>two</b> <b>pieces</b> of metal together. Shot welding was invented by Earl J. Ragsdale, a mechanical engineer at the Budd Company, in 1932 for the purposes of welding stainless steel. This welding method was used to construct the Pioneer Zephyr.|$|R
