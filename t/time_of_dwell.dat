40|$|Ribosome is a {{molecular}} machine that polymerizes a protein where {{the sequence of}} the amino acid residues, the monomers of the protein, is dictated by the sequence of codons (triplets of nucleotides) on a messenger RNA (mRNA) {{that serves as the}} template. The ribosome is {{a molecular}} motor that utilizes the template mRNA strand also as the track. Thus, in each step the ribosome moves forward by one codon and, simultaneously, elongates the protein by one amino acid. We present a theoretical model that captures most of the main steps in the mechano-chemical cycle of a ribosome. The stochastic movement of the ribosome consists of an alternating sequence of pause and translocation; the sum of the durations of a pause and the following translocation is the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwell</b> of the ribosome at the corresponding codon. We derive the analytical expression for the distribution of the dwell times of a ribosome in our model. Whereever experimental data are available, our theoretical predictions are consistent with those results. We suggest appropriate experiments to test the new predictions of our model, particularly, the effects of the quality control mechanism of the ribosome and that of their crowding on the mRNA track.

40|$|The {{progress}} of the successive rounds of catalytic conversion of substrates into product(s) by a single enzyme {{is characterized by the}} distribution <b>of</b> turnover <b>times.</b> Establishing the most general form of dependence of this distribution on the substrate concentration [S] is one of the fundamental challenges in single molecule enzymology. The distribution <b>of</b> the <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>of</b> a molecular motor at the successive positions on its track is an analogous quantity. We derive approximate series expansions for the [ATP]-dependence of the first two moments <b>of</b> the <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> distributions <b>of</b> motors that catalyze hydrolysis of ATP to draw input energy. Comparison between our results for motors with branched pathways and the corresponding expressions reported earlier for linear enzymatic pathways provides deep insight into the effects of the branches.

40|$|KIF 1 A, a processive single headed kinesin {{superfamily}} motor, hydrolyzes Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to {{move along}} a filamentous track called microtubule. The stochastic movement of KIF 1 A {{on the track}} is characterized by an alternating sequence of pause and translocation. The sum of the durations of pause and the following translocation defines the dwell time. Using the NOSC model (Nishinari et. al.

40|$|International audienceSensorimotor {{synchronization}} is {{a fundamental}} skill involved {{in the performance of}} many individual and ensemble artistic tasks (e. g., music, dance). Separate theories may explain how time intervals are estimated, and how bodily displacements toward spatial goals are controlled. However, {{the manner in which the}} nervous system produces movements toward concomitant temporal and spatial goals remains poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that typical rhythmic movements involve a motion and motionless phase (dwell). The dwell phase represents a sizeable fraction of the rhythm period, and scales with this period. The rationale for this specific organization remains unexplained, and is the object of this study. Two groups of participants (drummers, non-drummers) performed tapping movements paced at 0. 5 - 2. 5 Hz. The participants consistently organized their behavior between acoustic cues into dwell and movement phases, and movement kinematics varied with the period of the rhythm, yielding velocity profiles becoming increasingly asymmetric as the period expanded. The main new results were that the temporal variability <b>of</b> both the <b>dwell</b> and movement phases were consistent with Weber's law, and the longest phase exhibited always the smallest variability. We developed an optimal statistical model that formalized the distribution <b>of</b> <b>time</b> into <b>dwell</b> and movement intervals as a function of their temporal variability. The model accurately predicted the participants' dwell and movement durations irrespective of musical skill, strongly suggesting that the distribution <b>of</b> <b>dwell</b> and movement intervals results from an optimization process, dependent on each participant's skill to predict time during rest and movement...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{observer}} {{design for a}} class of single-output nonlinear systems with Markov jumps. The Markov jump process interferes with a deterministic nonlinear dynamics at random times and retains its state for a certain amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> (<b>dwell</b> time). The estimation process is reset at these random times, depending on the reset values of the state process, and then evolves as a deterministic estimate of the state process itself. The novelty is given by the reset mechanism adopted for the estimation process itself, depending on the reset values of the slate process. We prove that, {{as long as the}} mathematical expectation <b>of</b> the <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> has a positive lower bound and the transition rate of the jump process at the first exit <b>time</b> out <b>of</b> any point is bounded, the state estimation error of the switching dynamics asymptotically converges to zero with probability one. The state estimate over each dwell time is designed using the novel technique of 'output immersion': each single-output nonlinear dynamics is 'immersed' into a system with as many outputs as its states. The immersed dynamics can be split into one-dimensional dynamics each one with its state and output. By estimating the state of each one-dimensional dynamics we determine a state estimator for the dynamics before immersion. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Patronage to bus public {{transport}} is growing quickly in Brisbane {{due to the}} development of its busway network. The busway corridors are at different stages of completion. However, with the increased public support travel demand, busway stations are becoming more crowded during the peak hours. Heavy boarding of passengers at some busway station platforms reduces comfort levels for passengers and makes the walking and manoeuvring to the bus door difficult. This in turn increases passenger boarding service times and hence <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> buses. Increased <b>dwell</b> <b>times</b> decrease the capacity of the loading areas on the platform and increase the bus delay through the station. Variation in delays through stations in turn affects the running <b>time</b> <b>of</b> buses along the corridor, which reduces the reliability <b>of</b> arrival <b>times,</b> with the associated flow-on impacts to later buses and formation of bus bunching. This paper looks into the operational efficiency of a busway station during the weekday afternoon school peak period in terms <b>of</b> passenger service <b>times</b> and station platform capacity. Mater Hill Busway Station on the South East Busway corridor of Brisbane was used as a case study. This station {{is one of the major}} stations on the corridor serving a large number of institutional employees, students and patrons with a nearby hospital, high schools, academic institutions, businesses and high density residential development. Passenger and bus flow data on the outbound peak direction platform was collected by using video recording technique and attributes including arrival <b>time</b> <b>of</b> bus, <b>dwell</b> <b>time,</b> departure <b>time,</b> number <b>of</b> passengers boarding and alighting was collected by viewing the video footage on a desktop computer. The extracted data was analysed. The passenger service <b>times,</b> and efficiency <b>of</b> each loading area considering the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> the loading area was empty as well as blocked for the bus entry, were calculated. In turn, the capacity of the bus station platform was calculated based on the methodology of the US Transportation Board’s Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TRB, 2003) calibrated using the site data. Field passenger boarding service times were significantly higher than the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TRB 2003) default value. Excessive passenger service times for loading area 3 arise due to “spent” dwell time as passengers walk from their waiting position to the end of the platform. The lead loading area and second loading area were found to reduce in efficiency respectively over the 100 percent efficiency of loading area 3. This study found that blocking of a loading area, particularly for the lead loading area, has significant impact on the station capacity. However, loading area efficiencies were found to be very similar to TCQSM default values for a busway station. The analysis shows that the station platform was operating at a degree of saturation of 56 percent which accorded with field observations. Higher field passenger boarding service times resulted in a substantial capacity over-estimate using the TCQSM...|$|R

Material and methods: 33 patients who underwent MR image-based HDR intracavitary-brachytherapy for cervixcancer based on GYN-ESTRO recommendations were selected for evaluation. Tandem/ovoid (T/O) and Vienna applicatorswere used. HS of diameter of 5 mm were drawn around the tandem/needles/ovoid and ring. Three plans weregenerated: manual optimized plan (MOPT), IPSA without help structures (IPSA_woHS) and IPSA with help structures(IPSA_wHS). Dose-volume parameters and the loading pattern were evaluated. Results: For T/O, the use of HS did not make significant impact in the dose-volume parameters and in the loadingof tandem and ovoids, however steep variation was found in the individual <b>dwell</b> <b>time.</b> In case <b>of</b> Vienna applicator,inclusion of HS in the optimization made a significant impact in loading of needles. The percentage ratio oftotal <b>time</b> <b>of</b> needles to the tandem (TN/T%) was found to be 14 ± 2. 5, 53 ± 9, 22 ± 6 for MOPT, IPSA_woHS andIPSA_wHS, respectively, which implies that in IPSA_woHS the dwell time in needles were half <b>of</b> the <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> inthe tandem, while in MOPT the needles were loaded only in 14 %, and in IPSA_wHS it was 22 % <b>of</b> the <b>dwell</b> timeof tandem.

40|$|A propagator {{for the one}} {{dimensional}} time-dependent Schrödinger equation with an asymmetric rectangular potential is obtained using the multiple-scattering theory approach. It allows for the consideration of the reflection and transmission processes as the particle scattering at the potential jump (in contrast to the conventional wave-like picture) and for accounting for the nonclassical counterintuitive contribution of the backward-moving component of the wave packet attributed to the particle. This propagator completely resolves the corresponding time-dependent Schrödinger equation (defines the wave function ψ(x,t)) and allows for considering the quantum mechanical effects of a particle reflection from the potential downward step/well and a particle tunneling through the potential barrier as a function <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> These results are related to fundamental issues such as measuring time in quantum mechanics (tunneling <b>time,</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> arrival, <b>dwell</b> <b>time).</b> For imaginary time, which represents an inverse temperature (t→-iħ/k_BT), the obtained propagator {{is equivalent to the}} density matrix for a particle that is in a heat bath and is subject to a rectangular potential. If one shifts to imaginary time (t→-it), the matrix element of the calculated propagator in the spatial basis provides a solution to the diffusion-like equation with a rectangular potential. The obtained exact results are presented as the integrals from elementary functions and thus allow for a numerical visualization of the probability density |ψ(x,t) |^ 2, the density matrix and the solution of the diffusion-like equation.

In order to maintain successful treatment for patients, an independent Quality Assurance (QA) verification is crucial to measure the High Dose Rate (HDR) source positioning and dwell time periodically to ensure the prescribed dose is correct and safe for brachytherapy treatment. The current QA practice used to validate the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>dwell</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the source is by using a stopwatch and measure the dwell position on the source position check ruler. Nevertheless, reaction <b>time</b> <b>of</b> human poses a major concern regarding the accuracy in these manual operating procedures. In this thesis, a new QA tool is proposed to acquire accurate information about time structure and source positioning in HDR brachytherapy. The tool consists of a consumer-grade webcam, a source position check ruler, a laptop computer and a custom-made combined camera-ruler mounting tool. The camera is used to capture {{the motion of the}} moving source in real time. Each frame contains positional and temporal information that are important to determine the difference between the measured and the actual HDR source position and time structure. Finally, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application program is developed to receive the input from the camera for image processing.
