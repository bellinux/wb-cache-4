TIMSS studies {{over the past decade}} have confirmed that South African learners‟ results (Grades 8 and 9 in 2011) remained at a low ebb, denying them the opportunity to compete and excel globally in the field of Mathematics. It is against this backdrop that the researcher investigated the meaningful understanding of the important yet challenging algebraic concept of Proportion. The theoretical as well as the empirical underpinnings of the fundamental idea of Proportion are highlighted. The meaningful learning of Algebra was explored and physical, effective and cognitive factors affecting meaningful learning of Algebra, views on Mathematics and learning theories were examined. The research narrowed down to the meaningful understanding of Proportion, misconceptions, and facilitation in developing Proportional reasoning. This study was embedded in an interpretive paradigm and the research design was qualitative in nature. The qualitative data was collected via <b>task</b> <b>sheets</b> and interviews. The sample informing the central phenomenon in the study consisted of a heterogeneous group of learners and comprised a kaleidoscope of nationalities, both genders, a variety of home languages, differing socio-economic statuses and varying cognitive abilities. The findings cannot be generalised.

40|$|Cell {{division}} {{is a topic}} widely recognized by biology teachers for its importance in the curriculum. However, it is also regarded by teachers and students as a very difficult topic. Students at different school levels often hold many misconceptions in cell divisions. While diagrams have been so commonly employed in biology textbooks to enhance the textual representation of cell divisions, the researcher of this study questioned about the cognitive role of the diagrams in helping students construct new concepts of cell divisions, as well as students’ competence in learning from the diagrams. This exploratory {{study was conducted to}} investigate how secondary school students made use of textbook diagrams to gain new information about cell divisions, if and how the diagrams induced misconceptions in students, the problems students encountered when interpreting the diagrams and captions, and their perceptions of the usefulness of diagrams in learning cell divisions specifically and biology in general. Twenty-two secondary four students took part in this study. They were provided with a textbook illustration of mitotic and meiotic cell divisions, consisting of schematic diagrams and captions, for self-study. Data was collected from the students’ performance on a <b>task</b> <b>sheet</b> and their responses in individual interview. The <b>task</b> <b>sheet</b> assessed the new concepts (and/or misconceptions) constructed by the students through their (mis-) interpretation of the diagrams and captions in the illustration. The individual interview probed deeper into the students’ cognitive processing of the information in the illustration. Results showed that the students were able to employ different strategies to interpret the diagrams and captions to construct new knowledge to solve problems in the <b>task</b> <b>sheet.</b> However, they also showed weaknesses and problems in interpreting the diagrams. The problems included superficial processing of diagrams, lack of awareness and skills of interpreting diagram conventions, misinterpretation of temporal relationship among different diagrams or different diagram components. As a result, a number of misconceptions on cell divisions were detected among the students. These included misconceptions related to: (1) changes in chromosome number in cell divisions, (2) crossing over occurring at metaphase I of meiosis, and chromosome arrangement at metaphase I. The study also found that students generally perceived diagrams useful for learning cell divisions, but not for learning biology in general. They seemed to have underestimated the functions of textbook diagrams in representing biology concepts and undervalued the roles that diagrams may play in assessment of their understanding of biological concepts. The research findings contribute to the literature on misconceptions of cell divisions by uncovering students’ misinterpretation of specific kinds of diagrams as the origin of their learning difficulties. The findings also contribute to the growing literature on students’ visual perception and the power of diagrams for learning from science textbooks. Recommendations were made for textbook authors to improve design of diagrams illustrating scientific concepts, for teachers to equip students with visual literacy skills to learn from diagrams, and for teacher trainers to provide relevant training to pre-service and in-service teachers. Some suggestions for further research were also discussed. published_or_final_versionEducationMasterMaster of Educatio...|$|E

The study stemmed from an observation that JLEs were unwilling to express disagreements in exchanges with high-power (+P) interlocutors, possibly due {{to the threat of}} face-loss and the consequences of offending a +P interlocutor. Two questions were considered: (1) How did the JLEs perceive power distance between themselves and native speakers (NSs), and how did this affect their selection of disagreement strate-gies with NS interlocutors? (2) How might their perception of power distance affect how they learned dis-agreement strategies? Data was collected from 12 JLEs using a discourse completion task, a series of role-plays and a weekly <b>task</b> <b>sheet.</b> The data revealed that, though the participants were capable of disagreeing with power-equals, they were reluctant to disagree with +P interlocutors.

The focus of this qualitative research {{study was to explore}} the alternative conceptions of science teachers and their origins about basic concepts of current electricity. The concepts were taken from the science curricula of classes VI and VII and mainly include the concepts about the nature and flow of electric current, conductors and insulators, electric current in a simple circuit and electric current in a series and a parallel circuit. The sample included six middle school science teachers from three private schools in Karachi. Three different tools were used to explore teachers 2 ̆ 7 conceptions and their origins about the selected concepts. The tools were (a) observation of classroom teaching while current electricity was being taught, (b) two questionnaires namely Learning Experience Sheet 2 ̆ 7 and <b>Task</b> <b>Sheet</b> 2 ̆ 7, (c) an in-depth interview session. Learning Experience Sheet helped me to investigate how teachers had learnt about current electricity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to find out}} the {{importance}} of errors in students’ foreign language learning. In order to find out what kind of errors {{play a crucial role in}} the process of acquiring a foreign language, a study was carried out, in which fifty-eight students took part. A composition task, a multiple choice <b>task</b> <b>sheet</b> and a questionnaire was given to the students for completion so as to observe their different error categories, and to make comparisons between the groups at different levels. After data collection and analysis, the results of the study have shown that the influence of the mother tongue was greater in the case of the multiple choice test, however, in the composition task, developmental errors were dominant. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that students have to work on their language proficiency, and as far as their writings are concerned, they are very poor at grammar, so a new grammar teaching method should be introduced in order to be more successful in foreign language learning.

40|$|Task {{sheets are}} written texts {{generated}} specifically for assessment purposes {{in high schools}} in Queensland, Australia. They attempt to make assessment transparent by explaining the criteria used to assess performance. The criteria and statements of standards describe how a grade is awarded and provide evidence of teacher accountability for assessment. In this paper, task sheets from two Year 8 English classes in two such schools are described and analysed to investigate three questions: (1) What do task sheets reveal about practices and relationships operating in classroom-based literacy assessment?(2) How do task sheets document what counts as literacy and performance in literacy at this level of schooling? (3) Can any <b>task</b> <b>sheet</b> be ‘transparent’ and how much interpretation is required {{to make sense of}} it? The analysis was guided by a framework of methods drawn from Fairclough (1992), Gee (1990),and critical linguistic approaches. It found that task sheets are complex texts which communicate dimensions of assessment relating to teachers’ and students’ roles, the purposes of assessment, and criteria for what counts as performance.

40|$|This {{research}} project had three aims. The first {{was to investigate}} the culture of literacy assessment in English classrooms {{during the first year of}} high school. The second aim was to examine the interplay of elements of classroom-based literacy assessment including: the use of alternative assessment methods, tasks, and practices; the influence of principles of literacy assessment, discourses related to literacy assessment, and teacher-student interactions in classrooms. A third aim was to develop an understanding of the perceptions of the participants related to literacy assessment during one school year. Two studies were undertaken to achieve these aims. The preliminary study surveyed Year 8 English teachers in Queensland, Australia about their perceptions and practices of literacy assessment. The survey composed of open and closed questions was sent to 100 state high schools. Data from the 120 returned surveys were analysed using quantitative and qualitative techniques. The main findings from the survey were that Year 8 teachers knew little about their students 2 ̆ 7 previous experiences of literacy assessment. Teachers perceived that students needed to understand the assessment program in high school. However, teachers recognised that students faced difficulties in dealing with new regimes of assessment. While teachers were positive about their assessment programs, they were also concerned about their lack of expertise in assessment and their recording procedures. Tensions between teachers 2 ̆ 7 expectations of their students and their values and practices suggested that a further exploration of literacy assessment was required in classroom settings. This exploration was undertaken in the main study. The main study comprised a detailed investigation of literacy assessment in two Year 8 English classrooms using a longitudinal, qualitative research design. Data were collected systematically from multiple sources, numerous times throughout one school year. Data gathering methods included observations, interviews, document collection, videotaping, ranking activities, and collecting participants 2 ̆ 7 accounts of literacy assessment events. A range of qualitative analysis techniques was applied to each form of data. The main study found that while teachers had some autonomy in assessment, they were also constrained by the requirements of assessment programs outlined in syllabus documents. In these programs, teachers are responsible for the development, implementation and marking of up to ten assessment tasks during the year. An analysis of teachers 2 ̆ 7 programs and practices identified <b>task</b> <b>sheets</b> as key assessment texts. They were used in multiple ways by the teachers and their students. Students 2 ̆ 7 understandings about <b>task</b> <b>sheets</b> varied, their comprehension of <b>task</b> <b>sheets</b> was limited, and they understood less than their teachers expected. The pedagogy of literacy assessment was dominated by implicit teaching and centred on completing assessment tasks. The teachers adopted authoritative positions in assessment talk and there were limited opportunities for students to participate in the assessment process. In talk around assessment, students were introduced to institutionalised ways of valuing and doing assessment. Teachers 2 ̆ 7 detailed explanations of tasks had limited effects on students 2 ̆ 7 learning, and during the year there was increasing student resistance to these explanations. The teachers 2 ̆ 7 and their students 2 ̆ 7 understandings of tasks and assessment were incongruent. However, the teachers and students did share a focus on assessment as a goal in itself. Purposes for completing tasks such as developing new literacy skills were not evident in participants 2 ̆ 7 accounts. Although the first aim of the study {{was to investigate the}} culture of assessment, multiple cultures of assessment were identified. The study also concluded that in these classrooms there were multiple discourses related to assessment which were co-constructed by teachers and students during assessment related activities. These discourses were not always shared and were understood in different ways by the teachers and students. Implications were drawn from these findings about directions for future research including: broadening the research to other contexts, continuing investigations of classroom-based assessment theory and practice, and further longitudinal studies of students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions. Implications for practice focused on re-examining the purposes and focus of assessment in the first year of high school, increasing teachers 2 ̆ 7 and students 2 ̆ 7 awareness of the complexity of the assessment process, and improving the development and construction of <b>task</b> <b>sheets.</b> The study is an example of how a longitudinal approach using a range of research strategies, drawn from both quantitative and qualitative paradigms, can be effectively applied to investigate classroom-based literacy assessment. The study also provided a framework for the investigation of classroom-based literacy assessment practices which might be applied to other research contexts. The findings reveal that the implementation and use of alternative approaches to assessing literacy in the high school context provided no easy answers to issues related to principles, practices and student participation in assessment. Finally, the findings from the study have revealed the importance of developing an understanding of the perspectives of all classroom participants if the effectiveness of assessment as a teaching and learning tool is to be optimised for all learners...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown the value of peer feedback in writing class. By evaluating their peer’s works, students can figure out {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of their friends’ drafts. After doing this, it is expected that they could compare their peer’s work to their own work, which will certainly be beneficial for the revision process. The biggest challenge I faced when implementing peer feedback is how to scaffold the students to be able to provide valuable input to their friends’ works.
