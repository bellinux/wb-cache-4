5|$|As a philologist, Tolkien's {{interest}} in languages led him <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> several languages {{of his own}} as a pastime. In considering the nature of who might speak these languages, and what stories they might tell, Tolkien again turned {{to the concept of}} elves.|$|E
5|$|However, {{it is by}} {{no means}} an {{arbitrary}} convention, because not adopting it forces one either <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> strange new objects or to abandon some of the familiar rules of arithmetic.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Bain, a Scottish {{clock and}} {{instrument}} maker, {{was the first}} <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> and patent the electric clock in 1840. On January 11, 1841, Alexander Bain along with John Barwise, a chronometer maker, took out another important patent describing a clock in which an electromagnetic pendulum and an electric current is employed to keep the clock going instead of springs or weights. Later patents expanded on his original ideas.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{settlement}} Brezalauspurc (literally: Braslav's castle) {{is sometimes}} attributed to Bratislava, {{but the actual}} location of Brezalauspurc is under scholarly debate. The city's modern name is credited to Pavel Jozef Šafárik's misinterpretation of Braslav as Bratislav in his analysis if mediaeval sources, which led him <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> the term Břetislaw, which later became later Bratislav.|$|E
5|$|The summit, {{which is}} the {{collapsed}} dome of an ancient volcano, features the ruins of an observatory which was continuously staffed between 1883 and 1904. The meteorological data collected during this period are still important for understanding Scottish mountain weather. C. T. R. Wilson was inspired <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> the cloud chamber after a period spent working at the observatory.|$|E

5|$|In his {{cross-examination}} {{of the two}} doctors, Duchesne {{cited the}} psychological reports filed on Lamb at Penetanguishene in 1966, which had determined Lamb to have an IQ of 125, far above most of his 18-year-old peers. The prosecutor proposed {{that it was not}} beyond Lamb, with his psychopathic personality and high level of intelligence, <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> a story of amnesia and confusion to avoid responsibility for satisfying his dangerous impulses by consciously killing people. Both Yaworsky and Dolan said that although this was possible, they were each sticking to their original conclusions made in the days following the incident.|$|E
5|$|A feature {{already present}} in the {{treatments}} of the love story by Chaucer, Henryson, Shakespeare and Dryden is the repeated reinvention of its conclusion. Boitani sees this as a continuing struggle by authors to find a satisfying resolution to the love triangle. The major difficulty is the emotional dissatisfaction resulting from how the tale, as originally invented by Benoît, is embedded into the pre-existing narrative of the Trojan War with its demands for the characters to meet their traditional fates. This narrative has Troilus, the sympathetic protagonist of the love story, killed by Achilles, a character totally disconnected from the love triangle, Diomedes survive to return to Greece victorious, and Cressida disappear from consideration {{as soon as it}} is known that she has fallen for the Greek. Modern authors continue <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> their own resolutions.|$|E
5|$|Armillary sphere, hydraulic-powered: Hipparchus (c. 190– c. 120 BC) {{credited}} the Ancient Greek mathematician, geographer, astronomer, {{and poet}} Eratosthenes (276–194 BC) {{as the first}} <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> the armillary sphere representing the celestial sphere. However, the Chinese astronomer Geng Shouchang of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) invented it separately in China in 52 BC, while the Han dynasty polymath Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) {{was the first to}} apply motive power to the rotating armillary sphere by a set of complex gears rotated by a waterwheel which in turn was powered by the constant pressure head of an inflow clepsydra clock, the latter of which he improved with an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel.|$|E

5|$|Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 {{revealed}} that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit {{is proportional to the}} rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.|$|E
5|$|Li Shizhen (1518–93) – one of {{the most}} renowned pharmacologists and {{physicians}} in Chinese history – belonged to the late Ming period. His Bencao Gangmu is a medical text with 1,892 entries, each entry with its own name called a gang. The mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name. Inoculation, although it can be traced to earlier Chinese folk medicine, was detailed in Chinese texts by the sixteenth century. Throughout the Ming dynasty, around fifty texts were published on the treatment of smallpox. In regards to oral hygiene, the ancient Egyptians had a primitive toothbrush of a twig frayed at the end, but the Chinese were the first <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> the modern bristle toothbrush in 1498, although it used stiff pig hair.|$|E
5|$|Peel {{worked with}} one of his weavers, James Hargreaves, to {{investigate}} new technologies. In 1762, Peel and Hargreaves set up a carding machine, but decided against using it. When Hargreaves went on <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> the spinning jenny in 1764, Peel was keen to use the technology. He set them up in his factory at Stanhill where Hargreaves worked. In the spring of 1768, the spinning jennies at Peel's factory were blamed for job losses. The factories and Hargreaves' nearby house were the targets of a riot, destroying the spinning jennies within– along with some of Peel's own inventions. In reaction, Peel moved his manufacturing away from Lancashire. He decided on Burton-upon-Trent where he built three mills, including cutting a canal for one.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>inventing</b> {{the first}} street lights in Copenhagen, Rømer also invented the meridian circle, the altazimuth, and the passage instrument (also {{known as the}} transit instrument, a type of meridian circle whose horizontal axis is not fixed in the east-west direction).|$|R

5000|$|The New Left Review, in an {{obituary}} following Hall’s {{death in}} February 2014, wrote [...] "His exemplary investigations came close <b>to</b> <b>inventing</b> {{a new field}} of study, 'cultural studies'; in his vision, the new discipline was profoundly political in inspiration and radically interdisciplinary in character." ...|$|R
5|$|Several {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} rongorongo {{may have been an}} invention inspired by this visit and the signing of the treaty of annexation. As circumstantial evidence, they note that no explorer reported the script prior to Eugène Eyraud in 1864, and are of the opinion that the marks with which the chiefs signed the Spanish treaty do not resemble rongorongo. The hypothesis of these researchers is not that rongorongo was itself a copy of the Latin alphabet, or of any other form of writing, but that the concept of writing had been conveyed in a process anthropologists term trans-cultural diffusion, which then inspired the islanders <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> their own system of writing. If this is the case, then rongorongo emerged, flourished, fell into oblivion, and was all but forgotten within a span of less than a hundred years.|$|E
5|$|The {{judge said}} there were three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E
5|$|According to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, {{the themes}} of {{alienation}} and persecution, although present in Kafka's work, have been over-emphasised by critics. They argue Kafka's work is more deliberate and subversive—and more joyful—than may first appear. They point out that reading the Kafka work while focusing on the futility of his characters' struggles reveals Kafka's play of humour; he is not necessarily commenting on his own problems, but rather pointing out how people tend <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> problems. In his work, Kafka often created malevolent, absurd worlds. Kafka read drafts of his works to his friends, typically concentrating on his humorous prose. The writer Milan Kundera suggests that Kafka's surrealist humour {{may have been an}} inversion of Dostoyevsky's presentation of characters who are punished for a crime. In Kafka's work a character is punished although a crime has not been committed. Kundera believes that Kafka's inspirations for his characteristic situations came both from growing up in a patriarchal family and living in a totalitarian state.|$|E

5|$|After {{seeing how}} well the first film was made, {{the cast and crew}} signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back, a {{practical}} decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> totally different situations and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy. They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace {{at the end of the}} first film, and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device. They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the first film. They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in the first film), which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.|$|E
5|$|The {{craft of}} making reborn dolls {{began in the}} United States in the late 1990s. Reborning follows a long {{tradition}} of collectors, artists, and manufacturers restoring and enhancing dolls in order to portray more realism. The internet has allowed doll artists and collectors to create an online society focused on reborn dolls. In 2002, the first reborn was offered on eBay. This has expanded the reborn market allowing artists to open online stores which function figuratively as nurseries. The niche market for the dolls began with doll collectors who admired the superior lifelike accuracy of the doll. The market quickly reached those who wanted to use the doll as an emotional outlet, either to mother or for therapeutic purposes. Mass media coverage has helped to develop the phenomenon in other countries. Reborning enjoys popularity in the United Kingdom and Australia, but has also reached Canada, the rest of Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Doll manufacturers have also taken advantage of the trend and sell supplies, tools, and accessories catering to reborn followers. This has allowed reborners <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> new techniques causing the dolls to become increasingly realistic over time. Magazines, books, organizations, and conventions dedicated to reborn dolls have been started {{as a result of this}} popularity.|$|E
5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel <b>to</b> <b>invent</b> many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that frequency modulation (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of noise {{that it was possible to}} remove by filtering to that part of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E
5000|$|During World War II a {{different}} type of crankcase ventilation had <b>to</b> be <b>invented</b> <b>to</b> allow tank engines to operate during deep fording operations, where the normal draft tube ventilator would have allowed water to enter the crankcase and destroy the engine. [...] The PCV system and its control valve were <b>invented</b> <b>to</b> meet this need, but no need for it on automobiles was recognized.|$|R
