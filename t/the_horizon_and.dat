The film reveals his legal name to be Robin John Blake, a homage to Batman's sidekick in the comics, Robin.|$|E
5|$|The {{engine and}} {{propeller}} had automatic controls, and an auto-trimmer made the aircraft tail-heavy as the pilot rolled over into his dive, lining up red lines at 60°, 75° or 80° on the cockpit side window with <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>and</b> aiming {{at the target}} with {{the sight of the}} fixed gun. The heavy bomb was swung down clear of the propeller on crutches prior to release.|$|E

5|$|Although above <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>and</b> hence {{visible to}} the Ancient Greeks, Antlia's stars were too faint to have been {{included}} in any ancient constellations. The stars that now comprise Antlia lay within an area of the sky covered by the ancient constellation Argo Navis, the Ship of the Argonauts, which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by Lacaille in 1763. Ridpath reports that due to their faintness, the stars of Antlia did not make up part of the classical depiction of Argo Navis.|$|E
5|$|Five minutes later, the Allied ships spotted {{clouds of}} smoke on <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>and</b> Acton ordered the Italian ships to attack shortly {{afterwards}} {{while the two}} British cruisers turned {{to cut off the}} two Austrian destroyers. Aquila opened fire at 08:15 at long range, but inflicted no damage before she was immobilised by a hit at 08:32 that detonated inside her central boiler room and severed her main steam pipe. The Austrian ships managed to disengage before the cruisers could close the distance.|$|E
5|$|However, on {{the morning}} of 16 October Newman spotted Loire on <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>and</b> {{immediately}} ordered his ships in pursuit. Loire was faster than Mermaid in the high winds but was unable to outrun Kangaroo, which directly engaged the far larger frigate in a distant artillery duel. The difference in weight of shot between the combatants was greatly unbalanced, and Kangaroo eventually fell behind after suffering damage to her rigging. Loire too had been damaged, and by 06:45 the following morning Captain Segond realised he could not escape his pursuers and instead shortened sail, intending to engage Mermaid—by then the only pursuer still within reach.|$|E

5|$|Malone {{had been}} {{convinced}} {{for some time}} that war was on <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>and</b> prepared himself accordingly.

This reputedly included his sleeping on a military camp bed. Upon the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered for service either in New Zealand or overseas. Well regarded by his superiors in the Territorial Force, he was made commander of the Wellington Infantry Battalion of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF).|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} some glyphs are {{modified}} with the “guiding star” dependent glyph, while others are not, supports the idea that rongorongo was used for calendrical purposes in addition to astronomy and navigation. This is further evidenced by a tentative reading {{which is consistent with}} known astronomy. In the month of March, Rigel, Arcturus, and Sirius can be seen together, and the Milky Way appears in the north to the right of Arcturus. If one were sailing north, they would first see Arcturus on <b>the</b> <b>horizon,</b> <b>and</b> then Polaris. The arrangement of glyphs in this example, and the presence of 'guide modifiers' on Arcturus and Polaris, are consistent with these facts.|$|E

5|$|Around the planisphere {{moves the}} rete, a {{web-like}} metal cutout representing the zodiac, which {{also features a}} Julian calendar dial. Above the rete, a display indicates {{the day of the}} week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar dial. The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>and</b> dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E
5|$|Financially the Militia was {{neglected}} also. Despite the upturn in {{the economic}} situation in the early 1930s there was little financial respite for the Militia in this time. As the situation continued to improve, however, the defence vote was increased steadily after 1935. Indeed, in 1938 the government decided to double {{the strength of the}} Militia as war clouds began to loom on <b>the</b> <b>horizon,</b> <b>and</b> late in the year a recruiting campaign was launched that saw the size of the Militia increase from 35,000 to 43,000 men over the space of three months. This trend continued into 1939 and by midway through the year there were over 80,000 men serving on a part-time voluntary basis. Nevertheless, there was a serious shortage of equipment and as a result, when World War II broke out in September 1939 the Militia was by no means an effective fighting force and {{the nation as a whole}} was not as well prepared for war as it had been in 1914.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue {{and the sight of}} Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> <b>and</b> the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>horizon</b> area <b>and</b> {{curvature}} of three-charge BPS black strings are {{studied in the}} D-brane ensemble for the stationary black string. The charge distributions along the string are used to translate the classical expressions for <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> area <b>and</b> {{curvature of}} BPS black strings with waves into operators on the D-brane Hilbert space. Despite the fact that any `wavy' black string has smaller <b>horizon</b> area <b>and</b> divergent curvature, the typical values of <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> area <b>and</b> effects of <b>the</b> <b>horizon</b> curvature in <b>the</b> D-brane ensemble deviate negligibly {{from those of the}} original stationary black string in the limit of large integer charges. Whether this holds in general will depend on certain properties of the quantum bound states.

25|$|This is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used house system in modern Western astrology. The paths drawn for each degree of the ecliptic to move from the Imum coeli to <b>the</b> <b>horizon,</b> <b>and</b> from the horizon to the midheaven, are trisected to determine the cusps of houses 2, 3, 11, and 12. The cusps of houses 8, 9, 5 and 6 are opposite these. The Placidus system is sometimes not defined beyond polar circles (latitudes greater than 66°N or 66°S), because certain degrees are circumpolar (never touch <b>the</b> <b>horizon),</b> <b>and</b> planets falling in them cannot be assigned to houses without extending the system. This is the result of his weaknesses of the Placidean system according to its critics, which often cite the exceptional house proportions in the higher latitudes.|$|E
