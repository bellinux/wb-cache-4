25|$|My uncle Claude was my {{favorite}} uncle, he was also my godfather. He and I were really, really close. He used <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see cowboy movies {{all the time when}} I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it to me because I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
500|$|Affleck acted professionally {{throughout}} his childhood but, {{in his own}} words, [...] "not {{in the sense that}} I had a mom that wanted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Hollywood or a family that wanted to make money from me ... I kind of chanced into something." [...] He first appeared, at the age of seven, in a local independent film called Dark Side of the Street (1981), directed by a family friend. His biggest success as a child actor was as the star of the PBS children's series The Voyage of the Mimi (1984) and The Second Voyage of the Mimi (1988), produced for sixth-grade science classes. Affleck worked [...] "sporadically" [...] on Mimi from the age of eight to fifteen in both Massachusetts and Mexico. As a teenager, he appeared in the ABC after school special Wanted: A Perfect Man (1986), the television film Hands of a Stranger (1987), and a 1989 Burger King commercial.|$|E
2500|$|Born November 18, 1959 in Yellow Springs, Ohio, Blackman {{comes from}} a musical family, both her mother and {{grandmother}} were classical musicians and her uncle a vibist. [...] "My mom, when she was younger, played violin in classical orchestras, and her mom, incidentally, was a classical musician. My mom used <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see classical concerts", says Blackman. [...] "My dad was into jazz â€“ Miles Davis, Ahmad Jamal, people like that." [...] Blackman's first introduction to the drums happened when she {{was seven years old}} in her hometown of Yellow Springs, Ohio and attending a pool party at a friend's house, she went to use the bathroom and saw a drum set and just hopped onto the set. [...] "It was incredible", says Blackman. [...] "Just looking at them struck something in my core, and it was completely right from the second I saw them", says Blackman. [...] "And then, when I hit them, it was like, wow, that's me. That's completely natural for me. It's like breathing for me. It didn't feel awkward at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|His voice shook; {{but there}} was {{something}} in it that struck all the hearers. At that moment there sprung from the arbour in his boat a little creature, clapping her hands and stretching out her arms, and crying, [...] "Dear papa! Dear mamma! I am not killed. I am saved. I am coming <b>to</b> kiss you. <b>Take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> them, <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> them, good, kind sailors!" ...|$|R

2500|$|On one occasion, as Stephen was mopping {{the kitchen}} floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using to perform this task. In response, Rose smashed the boy {{over the head with}} the bowl, then {{repeatedly}} kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: [...] "You did that on purpose, you little swine!" [...] On another occasion, Rose became hysterical at a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae had screamed, [...] "No, Mum! No, Mum!" [...] as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing. Even Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in the late 1970s, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand, although Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose plunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in a towel and said: [...] "Look what you done, fella. You've got <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the hospital now." ...|$|E
