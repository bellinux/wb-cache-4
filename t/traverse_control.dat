40|$|A 3 -D laser {{fluorescence}} anemometer (LFA) was designed, built, {{and demonstrated}} {{for use in}} the Langley 16 x 24 inch Water Tunnel. Innovative optical design flexibility combined with compact and portable data acquisition and control systems were incorporated into the instrument. This will allow its use by NASA in other test facilities. A versatile fiber optic system facilities normal and off-axis laser beam alignment, removes mirror losses and improves laser safety. This added optical flexibility will also enable simple adaptation {{for use in the}} adjacent jet facility. New proprietary concepts in transmitting color separation, light collection, and novel prism separation of the scattered light was also designed and built into the system. Off-axis beam traverse and alignment complexity led to the requirement for a specialized, programmable transverse controller, and the inclusion of an additional traverse for the off-axis arm. To meet this challenge, an 'in-house' prototype unit was designed and built and <b>traverse</b> <b>control</b> software developed specifically for the water tunnel traverse applications. A specialized data acquisition interface was also required. This was designed and built for the LFA system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{are useful for}} monitoring physical parameters and detecting objects or substances in an area. Most ongoing research consider the use of either fixedly deployed stationary sensors or sensors on mobile platforms <b>traversing</b> <b>controlled</b> paths, which incur substantial costs in either equipments or coordination efforts. In this paper, we consider a different sensing model using uncoordinated mobile nodes whose mobility is not directed for any specific sensing activity. Instead, a node independently observes {{a cross section of}} the field along its own path. The limited observation of a node can be greatly extended via information exchange among collaborating nodes coming across each other. In this model, the inherently noisy nature of mobile measurements, incomplete scope of individual node observations, different sensing objectives, and collaboration policies must be addressed. The paper proposes a design framework for uncoordinated mobile sensing and a sensing approach based on profile estimation that is useful for target detection, field estimation, and edge detection. With simulations, relative performance measures are compared with typical solutions utilizing stationary sensors and controlled mobile sensors to illustrate their relative strengths and tradeoffs.

40|$|Many {{applications}} for unmanned vehicles involve autonomous interaction between {{two or more}} craft, and therefore, relative navigation is a key issue to explore. Several high fidelity hardware simulations exist to produce accurate dynamics. However, these simulations are restricted by size, weight, and power needed to operate them. The use of a small Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for the relative navigation problem is investigated. The UGV {{has the ability to}} traverse large ranges over uneven terrain and into varying lighting conditions which has interesting applications to relative navigation. The basic problem of a vehicle following another is researched and a possible solution explored. Statistical pressure snakes are used to gather relative position data at a specified frequency. A cubic spline is then fit to the relative position data using a least squares algorithm. The spline represents the path on which the lead vehicle has already <b>traversed.</b> <b>Controlling</b> the UGV onto this relative path using a sliding mode control, allows the follow vehicle to avoid the same stationary obstacles the lead vehicle avoided without any other sensor information. The algorithm is run on the UGV hardware with good results. It was able to follow the lead vehicle around a curved course with only centimeter-level positio...|$|R

50|$|The 6.5mm bullet {{was found}} to be too light for {{long-range}} fire support and anti-aircraft use, so in 1932 the heavier 8×63mm patron m/32 cartridge was developed. As this resulted in a heavier recoil, a spring-loaded cradle replaced the backplate with a heavily spring-loaded buffer that acted {{as an extension of the}} standard Browning recoil buffer. This also replaced the regular spade-grips with the ones integrated in the cradle. The cradle, now part of the weapon, would then be hooked onto a tripod m/36. This tripod featured, beside a 5×25 power optical sight, advanced elevation- and <b>traverse</b> <b>controls.</b> The unprecedented recoil control and steadiness of the tripod made Dolf Goldsmith remark that this arrangement “was undoubtedly the most accurate long-range rifle-caliber machine gun ever made”. For anti-air purposes, a double cradle was made to hold a matching pair of m/36. The right gun, lacking sights altogether, was fed from the right, while the left gun, with iron sights complemented with an AA sight ring, was fed from left. The cocking handles were located between the guns, while safety and triggers were individual for left and right. The special AA tripod had elongated legs and chains to either secure the tripod or hang weights on it for extra stability. These double cradles were also used as standard defense, mounted on a ring on the cab roof, on terrain vehicles and armored troop carriers like Terrängbil m/42 KP. The latter was used with good effect in the Congo crisis in the early 1960s. Until 1966, the m/14-29 and m/36 machine guns could use both the 6.5mm and the 8mm ammunition. Converting between the two was a matter of exchanging barrel, cartridge stop and bolt.|$|R
