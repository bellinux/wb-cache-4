5|$|If {{dropping}} {{the requirement for}} {{the uniqueness of the}} solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, but they can be completed <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> solution grid. Removal of any clue increases the number of the completions and from this perspective none of the 41 clues is redundant. With slightly more than half the grid filled with givens (41 of 81 cells), the uniqueness of the solution constraint still dominates over the minimality constraint.|$|E

5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A case in point is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E
5|$|Busoni gave many (but not all) of {{his works}} opus numbers; some numbers apply <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> work (after the {{composer}} dropped some of his earlier works from his acknowledged corpus). Nor are the composer's numbers all in temporal order. The musicologist Jürgen Kindermann has prepared a thematic catalogue {{of his works}} and transcriptions which is also used, {{in the form of}} the letters BV (for Busoni Verzeichnis, German:Busoni Index: sometimes the letters KiV for Kindermann Verzeichnis are used) followed by an identifier, to identify his compositions and transcriptions. The identifier B (for Bearbeitung, German: arrangement) is used for Busoni's transcriptions and cadenzas– e.g. BV B 1 refers to Busoni's cadenzas for Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4.|$|E

5|$|For locally {{advanced}} and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which together represent over 80% of cases, numerous recent trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, but not <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> year.

5|$|The {{gestation}} period varies within lemurs, ranging from 9 weeks in mouse lemurs and 9–10weeks in dwarf lemurs to 18–24weeks in other lemurs. The smaller, nocturnal lemurs, such as mouse lemurs, giant mouse lemurs, and dwarf lemurs, usually give birth <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> infant, whereas the larger, nocturnal lemurs, such as fork-marked lemurs, sportive lemurs, and the aye-aye usually have one offspring. Dwarf and mouse lemurs {{have up to}} four offspring, but both average only two. Ruffed lemurs are the only large, diurnal lemurs to consistently give birth {{to two or three}} offspring. All other lemurs have single births. Multiple births in lemurs are normally fraternal, and are known to occur in every five to six births in species such as the ring-tailed lemur and some Eulemur.|$|E
5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or fixed denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be fixed because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E
5|$|Various {{antibodies}} {{directed at}} nerve cells {{have been reported}} in Guillain–Barré syndrome. In the axonal subtype, these antibodies have been shown to bind to gangliosides, a group of substances found in peripheral nerves. A ganglioside is a molecule consisting of ceramide bound to a small group of hexose-type sugars and containing various numbers of N-acetylneuraminic acid groups. The key four gangliosides against which antibodies have been described are GM1, GD1a, GT1a, and GQ1b, with different anti-ganglioside antibodies being associated with particular features; for instance, GQ1b antibodies have been linked with Miller Fisher variant GBS and related forms including Bickerstaff encephalitis. The production of these antibodies after an infection is probably the result of molecular mimicry, where the immune system is reacting to microbial substances but the resultant antibodies also react with substances occurring naturally in the body. After a Campylobacter infection, the body produces antibodies of the IgA class; only a small proportion of people also produce IgG antibodies against bacterial substance cell wall substances (e.g. lipooligosaccharides) that crossreact with human nerve cell gangliosides. It is not currently known how this process escapes central tolerance to gangliosides, which is meant to suppress the production of antibodies against the body's own substances. Not all antiganglioside antibodies cause disease, and it has recently been suggested that some antibodies bind <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> type of epitope simultaneously (heterodimeric binding) and that this determines the response. Furthermore, the development of pathogenic antibodies may depend on the presence of other strains of bacteria in the bowel.|$|E

25|$|In the LDS Church today, {{both men}} and women may enter a {{celestial}} marriage with only one living partner at a time. A man may be sealed <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> woman. If his wife dies, he may enter another celestial marriage, and be sealed to both his living wife and deceased wife or wives. Many Mormons believe that all these marriages will be valid in the eternities and the husband will live together in the celestial kingdom as a family with all to whom he was sealed. In 1998, the LDS Church changed the policy and now also allows women to be sealed <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> man. A woman, however, may not be sealed <b>to</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>one</b> man at a time while she is alive. She may only be sealed to subsequent partners after she has died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely offered to the person in the afterlife. According to church teachings, the celestial marriage covenant, as with other covenants, requires the continued righteousness of the couple to remain in effect after this life. If only one remains righteous that person is promised a righteous eternal companion in eternity.|$|E
