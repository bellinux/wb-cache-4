25|$|From {{very early}} times, the Mesopotamian lunisolar {{calendar}} was in wide {{use by the}} countries of the western Asia region. The structure, which was also used by the Israelites, was based on lunar months with the intercalation of an additional month to bring the cycle closer to the solar cycle, although {{there is no evidence of}} a <b>thirteenth</b> <b>month</b> mentioned anywhere in the Hebrew Bible.|$|E
25|$|Many Zoroastrians {{migrated}} from the Middle East to India during the 10th century, becoming known in India as Parsis. They had {{knowledge of the}} Denkard's proposal: at some point between 1125 and 1129, the Parsi-Zoroastrians of the Indian subcontinent inserted such an embolismic month, named Aspandarmad vahizak (the month of Aspandarmad but with the suffix vahizak). That month would also be the last month intercalated: subsequent generations of Parsis neglected to insert a <b>thirteenth</b> <b>month.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ethiopia {{has several}} local {{calendar}}s. The most widely known is the Ethiopian calendar, {{also known as}} the Ge'ez calendar. It is based on the older Alexandrian or Coptic calendar, which in turn derives from the Egyptian calendar. Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six epagomenal days, which comprise a <b>thirteenth</b> <b>month.</b> The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez.|$|E

It is entitled Notice Historique, ‘Historical Record’, and heads the work named Pensées, ‘Thoughts’, of C.J.B. Bonnin. This document was promoted by Bonnin and, maybe, was reviewed by him also. Inside of the French administration files some {{references to}} him can be found, like his possible membership to franc-masonry.

50|$|In 1751, {{against his}} father's wishes Emin left for London. His {{first four years}} there were filled with misery and hard labour, and he was {{deprived}} of any financial assistance from his father. However, in 1755 Emin experienced {{a turning point in}} his life. He met and befriended Edmund Burke, the future British statesman and political writer, with whose support he gained access to the circles of British intellectuals and nobility. He received sponsorship from Hugh Percy the Duke of Northumberland and was admitted to the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich, where he remained for <b>thirteenth</b> <b>months</b> after which he enlisted as a volunteer in the British and Prussian armies during their war against France in order to gain practical experience.|$|R
50|$|Two {{days later}} an {{agreement}} was finally achieved. Under {{the leadership of}} Bleicher and Schleyer the negotiating teams met in Stuttgart's Hotel Graf Zeppelin and {{took part in a}} 30 hour marathon session, this time without the involvement of mediators. Agreement was reached for a 7.5% wage increase to be implemented in January 1972 and run for twelve months, supplement by a flat sum payment of DM 160 for the months of October and November and a wage-linked payment equivalent to 40% of a <b>thirteenth</b> <b>month's</b> salary payment. A vote was taken and 71,2% of the membership backed the deal. Bleicher, by now reaching the end of his career, could look back on the 1971 negotiations with some satisfaction. Although the increase achieved was not greatly in excess of the increase in the cost of living, he had succeeded, just as he had in 1963, in forcibly seeing off a determined attempt by the employers permanently to weaken the union's position.|$|R
25|$|According to the Recueil des Inscriptions Gauloises, {{more than}} 760 Gaulish {{inscriptions}} {{have been found}} throughout present-day France, with the notable exception of Aquitaine, and in northern Italy. Inscriptions include short dedications, funerary monuments, proprietary statements, and expressions of human sentiments, but the Gauls also left some longer documents of a legal or magical-religious nature, the three longest being the Larzac tablet, the Chamalières tablet and the Lezoux dish. The most famous Gaulish record is the Coligny calendar, a fragmented bronze tablet dating from the 2nd century AD and providing the names of Celtic months over a five-year span; it is a lunisolar calendar attempting to synchronize the solar year and the lunar month by inserting a <b>thirteenth</b> <b>month</b> every {{two and a half}} years.|$|E

40|$|The main {{sources of}} {{uncertainty}} in spacecraft orbital lifetime prediction are estimated future solar radio flux and geomagnetic activity, modeled atmospheric density, and the ballistic factor. The major source of uncertainty in models estimating future atmospheric density at orbital altitude is the solar extreme ultraviolet heat input values. The observed 10. 7 -cm solar radio flux (not adjusted to 1 AU) {{is used as a}} proxy for this most significant input, which is not otherwise available. Because no generally accepted physical solar model is available to accurately predict future solar activity, the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) developed a 13 -month Zurich smoothed solar radio flux (F 10. 7) and geomagnetic (A p) index intermediate (months) and long-range (years) statistical estimation technique [Niehuss et al., 1996]. The technique is also applicable to the 13 -month smoothed sunspot number (R).

60|$|My {{great-grandfather}} by the mother's side, Hermanus Van Clattercop, when {{employed to}} build the large stone church at Rotterdam, which stands about three hundred yards to your left after you turn off from the Boomkeys, and which is so conveniently constructed that all the zealous Christians of Rotterdam prefer sleeping through a sermon there to any other church in the city--my great-grandfather, I say, when employed to build that famous church, did {{in the first place}} send to Delft for a box of long pipes; then having purchased a new spitting-box and a hundredweight of the best Virginia, he sat himself down, and did nothing for the space of three months but smoke most laboriously. Then did he spend full three months more in trudging on foot, and voyaging in the trekschuit, from Rotterdam to Amsterdam--to Delft--to Haerlem--to Leyden--to the Hague, knocking his head and breaking his pipe against every church in his road. Then did he advance gradually nearer and nearer to Rotterdam, until he came in full sight of the identical spot whereon the church was to be built. Then did he spend three months longer in walking round it and round it; contemplating it, first from one point of view and then from another--now he would be paddled by it on the canal--now would he peep at it through a telescope, {{from the other side of}} the Meuse--and now would he take a bird's-eye glance at it, from the top of one of those gigantic windmills which protect the gates of the city. The good folks of the place were on the tiptoe of expectation and impatience--notwithstanding all the turmoil of my great-grandfather, not a symptom of the church was yet to be seen; they even began to fear it would never be brought into the world, but that its great projector would lie down and die in labor of the mighty plan he had conceived. At length, having occupied twelve good months in puffing and paddling, and talking and walking--having traveled over all Holland, and even taken a peep into France and Germany--having smoked five hundred and ninety-nine pipes and three hundredweight of the best Virginia tobacco--my great-grandfather gathered together all that knowing and industrious class of citizens who prefer attending to anybody's business sooner than their own, and having pulled off his coat and five pair of breeches, he advanced sturdily up, and laid the corner-stone of the church, in the presence of the whole multitude--just at the commencement of the <b>thirteenth</b> <b>month.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The circumclusion {{method for}} {{surgical}} closure of atrial septal defects (ASDs) of the secundum type makes it possible, during surgery, to close and reopen the defect as desired. In each of 23 patients the following statistically significant pressure and flow changes were found when the ASD was closed: increasing mean pressures in the ascending aorta (from 74 to 87 mm Hg), left atrium (from 10 to 18 mm Hg), and {{right pulmonary artery}} (from 20 to 24 mm Hg); increasing mean flows in the ascending aorta (from 84 to 1 11 ml/min/kg); decreasing mean pressures in the right atrium (from 9. 0 to 7. 7 mm Hg); and decreasing mean flows in the right pulmonary artery (from 78 to 46 ml/min/kg). Surprisingly, no correlation between shunt size determined before and during surgery was found. However, in the calculation of the intraoperative shunt, several factors might have contributed to an erroneous result. In 17 patients a right heart catheterization was performed in the third to <b>thirteenth</b> postoperative <b>month</b> and the following statistically significant changes from the intraoperative results with closed ASD were found: The intraoperative mean pressure in the left atrium (18 mm Hg) decreased to 7. 3 mm Hg after surgery (pulmonary wedge pressure), the pulmonary arterial pressure decreased from 23 to 13 mm Hg, and the right atrial pressure from 8. 2 to 1. 6 mm Hg...|$|R
50|$|In 1987, a {{disagreement}} with Dark Horse, over {{the direction of}} the title, convinced Smith to take Boris back from Dark Horse after the twelfth issue, and begin self-publishing the book under his own Nicotat Comics banner.

The original Boris continued to parody other comic books, although in a less vicious way, while also maturing into more of a somewhat serious adventure title. As the title changed and the book began shipping more and more infrequently, readership dropped and sales decreased. Eventually, despite Smith having the title plotted through the fortieth issue, Nicotat ended its run with the thirty-fourth issue in November, 1991.|$|R

At the centre of this wine-drinking festival was the celebration of the maturing of the wine stored at the previous vintage, whose pithoi were now ceremoniously opened, and the beginning of spring. Athenians of the Classical age were aware that the festival was of great antiquity; Walter Burkert points out that the mythic reflection of this is the Attic founder-king Theseus' release of Ariadne to Dionysus, but this is no longer considered a dependable sign that the festival had been celebrated in the Minoan period.

2500|$|Ahasuerus {{appoints}} Haman as his viceroy. Mordecai, {{who sits}} at the palace gates, falls into Haman's disfavor as he refuses to bow down to him. Having found out that Mordecai is Jewish, Haman plans to kill not just Mordecai but the entire Jewish minority in the empire. Obtaining Ahasuerus' permission and funds to execute this plan, he casts lots ("purim") to choose the date on which to do this – the <b>thirteenth</b> of the <b>month</b> of Adar. When Mordecai finds out about the plans, he puts on sackcloth and ashes, a sign of mourning, publicly weeping and lamenting, and many other Jews in Shushan {{and other parts of}} Ahasuerus' empire do likewise, with widespread penitence and fasting. [...] Esther discovers what has transpired; there follows an exchange of messages between her and Mordecai, with Hatach, one of the palace servants, as the intermediary. Mordecai requests that she intercede with the king on behalf of the embattled Jews; she replies that nobody is allowed to approach the king, under penalty of death. Mordecai warns her that she will not be any safer in the palace than any other Jew, says that if she keeps silent, salvation for the Jews will arrive from some other quarter but [...] "you and your father's house will perish," [...] and suggests that she was elevated to the position of queen to be of help in just such an emergency. Esther has a change of heart, says she will fast and pray for three days and will then approach the king to seek his help, despite the law against doing so, and [...] "if I perish, I perish." [...] She also requests that Mordecai tell all Jews of Shushan to fast and pray for three days together with her. On the third day, she seeks an audience with Ahasuerus, during which she invites him to a feast in the company of Haman. During the feast, she asks them to attend a further feast the next evening. Meanwhile, Haman is again offended by Mordecai's refusal to bow to him; egged on by his wife Zeresh and unidentified friends, he builds a gallows for Mordecai, with the intention to hang him there the very next day.|$|R
