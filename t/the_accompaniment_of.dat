5|$|Portable organs (the portative and the {{positive}} organ) were invented in the Middle Ages. Towards {{the middle of}} the 13th century, the portatives represented in the miniatures of illuminated manuscripts appear to have real keyboards with balanced keys, as in the Cantigas de Santa Maria. Its portability made the portative useful for <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> both sacred and secular music in a variety of settings.|$|E

The nightly menu on board included oyster fritters, diamondback terrapin, duck, and turkey.|$|E
40|$|Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale preludes are {{varied and}} artistic {{not only in}} the {{treatment}} of chorale melodies, but also in <b>the</b> <b>accompaniments</b> <b>of</b> those chorale melodies. This study examines <b>the</b> <b>accompaniments</b> <b>of</b> Bach's long chorale preludes, focusing on identifying the various types and the characteristics that make them unique. This study investigates the two broad categories <b>of</b> <b>accompaniments</b> depending on whether the motives are chorale-derived or independent of the chorale. While <b>the</b> chorale prelude <b>accompaniments</b> in <b>the</b> first large group are closely related, <b>the</b> <b>accompaniments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chorale preludes in the second group stand independently and illustrate the vast range of Bach's compositional skill. Both groups demonstrate Bach's interest in expanding his predecessors' models, a trait that can be traced throughout all of Bach's compositional history...|$|R

5|$|Writing Kannada {{literature}} in native metres was first popularised {{by the court}} poets. These metres were the sangatya, compositions sung to <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> a musical instrument; shatpadi, six-line verses; ragale, lyrical compositions in blank verse; and tripadi, three-line verses. However, Jain writers continued to use the traditional champu, composed of prose and verse. Important literary contributions in Kannada were made not only by court poets but also by noblemen, commanders, ministers, ascetics and saints associated with monasteries.|$|E
5|$|Kannada {{literature}} {{during this}} period consisted of writings relating to the socio-religious developments of the Veerashaiva and Vaishnava faiths, {{and to a lesser}} extent to that of Jainism. Writing on secular topics was popular throughout this period. Authorship of these writings was not limited to poets and scholars alone. Significant literary contributions were made by members of the royal family, their ministers, army commanders of rank, nobility and the various subordinate rulers. In addition, a vast body of devotional folk literature was written by musical bards, mystics and saint-poets, influencing society in the empire. Writers of this period popularised use of the native metres: shatpadi (six-line verse), sangatya (compositions meant to be sung to <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> a musical instrument), and tripadi (three-line verse).|$|E
5|$|Zino's petrel nests in burrows {{which are}} visited only at night, to <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> their {{haunting}} calls. The single white egg is incubated by both adults, one sitting {{during the day}} while the other feeds on fish and squid at sea. Eggs, chicks and adults {{have been subject to}} predation by introduced cats and rats, and in the past have been taken for food by local shepherds. Predator control, and other measures such as the removal of grazing animals which trample the burrows, has enabled the population to recover to 6580 breeding pairs; it remains endangered on the IUCN Red List. However, conservation efforts had a major setback in August 2010 when fires killed three adults and 65% of the chicks.|$|E

5|$|Govinda Vaidya, {{a native}} of Srirangapatna, wrote Kanthirava Narasaraja Vijaya, a eulogy of his patron King Narasaraja I. Written in sangatya metre (a {{composition}} meant to be rendered to <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> a musical instrument), the book describes the king's court, popular music {{and the types of}} musical compositions of the age in twenty-six chapters. King Chikka Devaraja was the earliest composer of the dynasty. To him is ascribed the famous treatise on music called Geetha Gopala. Though inspired by Jayadeva's Sanskrit writing Geetha Govinda, it had an originality of its own and was written in saptapadi metre. Contemporary poets who left their mark on the entire Kannada-speaking region include the brahmin poet Lakshmisa and the itinerant Veerashaiva poet Sarvajna. Female poets also played a role in literary developments, with Cheluvambe (the queen of Krishnaraja Wodeyar I), Helavanakatte Giriyamma, Sri Rangamma (1685) and Sanchi Honnamma (Hadibadeya Dharma, late 17th century) writing notable works.|$|E
5|$|Superman Returns {{was shot}} using Panavision's Genesis digital camera. Production {{designer}} Guy Hendrix Dyas {{was influenced by}} Frank Lloyd Wright's Johnson Wax Headquarters {{for the design of}} the Daily Planet. ESC Entertainment was originally set to design the visual effects sequences, but Warner Bros. replaced them with the hiring of Mark Stetson from Sony Pictures Imageworks as the visual effects supervisor. A total of 1,400 visual effects shots were created. The script required a scene of Superman safely delivering a Boeing 777 in a baseball park where computer-generated imagery was used as it would have been impossible to assemble the number of extras for the shots. A second unit crew traveled to Dodger Stadium to photograph elements that were composited into the final images. The scenes of Metropolis was actually {{a modified version of the}} skyline of Manhattan. Using footage from the original Superman (1978) film as a reference point, Marlon Brando was re-created by Rhythm & Hues using CGI. The opening credits for Superman Returns are presented in an intended recreation of the style used for Superman, again to <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> John Williams's theme music.|$|E
5|$|The Nifo oti, or Samoan fire knife dance, {{is also a}} kind {{of weapon}} dance. The kailao is a {{standing}} male war dance of Tonga. The kailao is performed by men (less commonly women also perform it with the men as a mixed dance), who carry clubs or fighting sticks. The performers dance in a fierce manner to emulate combat, all to <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> a slit drum or a tin box. Additional idiophonic percussion is provided by strung rattles worn on the anklets of the dancers, and the clashing together of the wooden implements of war, which today are either sticks or mock weapons. The dance is unusual for Tonga in that it lacks recited poetry as accompaniment, which fact is taken to mean that it was imported to Tonga from elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|First a new lyrical form called imayō (今様, modern style, {{a form of}} ryūkōka) emerged. Imayō {{consists}} of four lines in 8-5 (or 7-5) syllables. Usually it was sung to <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> instrumental music and dancing. Female dancers (shirabyōshi) danced to <b>the</b> <b>accompaniment</b> <b>of</b> imayō.

25|$|The Greeks practiced {{an early}} form of pigeage when grapes {{were ready for}} crushing.

They neither sung, jested, heard music, nor drank healths; and yet they seemed not the less, in their own phrase, to enjoy the creature-comforts, which the frailty of humanity rendered grateful to their outward man. Old Whitaker even protested, that, though much the smaller party in point of numbers, they discussed nearly as much sack and claret as his own more jovial associates.
