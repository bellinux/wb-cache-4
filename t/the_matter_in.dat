5|$|A senator {{could make}} a brief statement, discuss <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if they could keep the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E

5|$|Because {{they are}} members of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the {{question}} of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long-running discussions in UEFA. Swansea took one of England's three available places in the Europa League in 2013–14 by winning the League Cup in 2012–13. The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> March 2012, allowing them to participate.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  3, the MW {{distribution}} of organic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> municipal wastewater features a U shape, mostly above 100  k and below 1  k. Through A 2 /O treatment, <b>the</b> organic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> most MW distribution ranges can be effectively degraded, {{and the use}} rates of <b>the</b> organic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MW distribution ranges > 0.45  µm, 100  k– 0.45  µm, 30 – 100, 10 – 30, 5 – 10, 3 – 5, 1 – 3, and < 1  k, are 57.76, 8.64, 5.26, 71.64, 52.87, 46.83, 7.95, and 58.17 %, respectively. The use rates of <b>the</b> organic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MW distribution ranges > 0.45  µm, 10 – 30, 5 – 10, and < 1  k are high, all above 50 %. Therefore, one can see that <b>the</b> organic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> these ranges can easily be degraded by the A 2 /O system. While the use rates of <b>the</b> organic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MW distribution ranges of 100  k– 0.45  µm, 30 – 100, and 1 – 3  k remain low, being, respectively, lower than 10 %. This reflects that <b>the</b> organic <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> these ranges is hard to degrade by the A 2 /O process.|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1951-1952 season, the TSO {{refused to}} renew the {{contracts}} of these musicians, stating that they had not fulfilled their contractual agreements. The six musicians appealed this decision to its union, the Toronto Musicians' Association; the Mayor of Toronto; the Canadian Civil Liberties Association; and many other bodies, without success. They received support from the Federation of Canadian Artists and the Canada Council for the Arts, but not from the Canadian Congress of Labour. The incident garnered extensive media coverage in both Canada and the United States, and sparked a protest against the TSO's decision. The orchestra's director, Ernest MacMillan, did not speak about <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> public, which also prompted criticism, and two members of the TSO board resigned. The six musicians were viewed with suspicion by their colleagues and people avoided them to protect themselves from guilt by association. Budd and Staryk later returned to the TSO, while the four other musicians continued their careers elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Oregon Territory in 1848, the Oregon Country provisional government, through legislation on June 27, 1844 and December 19, 1845, selected Oregon City as the capital. Thus Oregon's first capitol was in Oregon City. One of the private buildings used by this government was constructed by John L. Morrison in 1850; it served as a capitol until the government moved to Salem. The designation of Oregon City as the seat of power was by proclamation of Governor Joseph Lane. In 1850, the legislature passed an act designating Salem the capital. However, Governor John P. Gaines refused to relocate and remained in Oregon City along with the Oregon Supreme Court (except justice Orville C. Pratt) until an act of Congress on May 14, 1852 settled <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> Salem's favor.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.|$|E

Other brief investigations were conducted by state firefighters and police and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, but these were ended quickly after confirming {{there was no evidence}} of the explosion and fire having been deliberately started.

5|$|On April 4, King—a {{prominent}} African-American {{civil rights}} leader—was assassinated. Race riots subsequently broke {{out across the}} United States. After delivering an improvised speech on <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> Indianapolis, Kennedy withdrew to the hotel he was staying in and suspended his presidential campaign. Community leaders convinced him to keep a single engagement before the City Club of Cleveland. Doing away with his prepared remarks, Kennedy's speechwriters worked early into the morning of April 5 creating a full response to the assassination. Kennedy reviewed and revised the draft during his flight to Cleveland. Speaking in a tragic mode for only ten minutes before 2,200 people, Kennedy outlined his view on violence in American society. He criticized both the rioters and the white establishment who, from his perspective, {{were responsible for the}} deterioration of social conditions in the United States. He proposed no specific solutions to the internal division and conflict, but admonished the audience to seek common ground and try to cooperate with other Americans.|$|E
5|$|On May 30, {{the accusations}} were restated, in an {{official}} communique, published by TASS, the official Soviet news agency. The same day, Stasys Lozoraitis—the Lithuanian envoy in Rome—was authorized to form a government in exile in case of the Soviet occupation. The Lithuanian police tightened security around Soviet bases and arrested 272 suspicious individuals, but that only drew additional criticism of harassment. Foreign Minister Juozas Urbšys offered to settle <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> direct negotiations in Moscow. Molotov agreed to talk but only with Prime Minister Antanas Merkys. On June 7, Merkys arrived in Moscow. The Soviets repeated the accusations of kidnapping. Other charges were leveled, including the allegation that Minister of the Interior Kazys Skučas and Director of State Security Department Augustinas Povilaitis had provoked Russian soldiers. During the second meeting on June 9, Molotov also accused the Lithuanian government of conspiring with Latvia and Estonia to establish a secret military union (in reference to the Baltic Entente), thereby violating the mutual assistance pact.|$|E

5|$|On {{the largest}} scale, the Universe is {{continually}} expanding, {{resulting in an}} average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see Hubble's law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early in the Universe, as clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This on-going merger process (as well as an influx of infalling gas) heats the inter-galactic gas within a cluster to very high temperatures, reaching 30–100 megakelvins. About 70–80% of the mass in a cluster {{is in the form}} of dark matter, with 10–30% consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent of <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> the form of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised {{on the witness stand}} with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>in</b> terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime.|$|E
5|$|Phocas's rule lacked {{legitimacy}} and quickly {{came to be}} resented by the populace and the elites of the Byzantine Empire. What prestige he had further eroded when the Persian shah Khosrau II (r. 590–628) declared war, and when the Byzantine forces began to suffer their first defeats. According to a later tradition, Priscus {{sent a letter to}} the Exarch of Africa, Heraclius the Elder, urging him to revolt. This is probably a later invention, but if true, it would indicate the level of dissent even within Constantinople. Whatever the truth of <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>in</b> 608 Africa rose in revolt, and the Exarch's son, Heraclius the Younger, was dispatched against Constantinople at the head of a fleet. Unopposed by Phocas's forces, he landed at the suburb of Hebdomon on October 3 and marched to the capital, where pro-Heraclian riots had broken out. At this juncture, Priscus pretended to be ill, and withdrew to his mansion at the Boraïdou quarter, where he assembled the excubitores and his own retainers (bucellarii), thus depriving Phocas of his main source of armed support. He is also recorded by John of Nikiu to have safeguarded the women of Heraclius's family from retribution by Phocas.|$|E
