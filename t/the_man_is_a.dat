25|$|Holmes is {{visited by}} Irene Adler, a former adversary who asks {{him to find}} a missing man named Luke Reordan. After her departure, Holmes follows her as she meets with her secret employer, and only learns that <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{professor}} and that he intimidates Adler. Meanwhile, sightings of a living Blackwood and the discovery of his destroyed tomb lead to belief that Blackwood has risen from the grave; Reordan is found dead inside Blackwood's coffin. Following a series of clues from the body, Holmes and Watson find Reordan's home and discover experiments attempting to merge science with magic. After they survive a battle with Blackwood's men who attempt to destroy the lab, Holmes is taken to the Temple of the Four Orders, a secret magical fraternity with considerable political influence. The leaders – Lord Chief Justice Sir Thomas Rotheram, U.S. Ambassador Standish, and Home Secretary Lord Coward– ask Holmes to stop Blackwood, {{a former member of}} the society and Sir Thomas's son.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson {{met with}} Victor Huguet (7 August), a French liaison officer summoned to London at Kitchener’s request, {{and sent him}} back to France to obtain more {{information}} from Joffre, having told him of British plans to start movement of troops on 9 August. Kitchener, angry that Wilson had acted without consulting him, summoned him to his office for a rebuke. Wilson was angry that Kitchener was confusing the mobilisation plans by deploying troops from Aldershot to Grimsby in case of German invasion, and recorded in his diary that [...] "I answered back as I {{have no intention of}} being bullied by him especially when he talks such nonsense … <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fool … He is a d---- fool". On Huguet's return (12 August) he met with French, Murray and Wilson. They agreed to deploy the BEF to Maubeuge, but Kitchener, in a three-hour meeting which was, according to Wilson, [...] "memorable in showing K’s colossal ignorance and conceit", tried to insist on a deployment to Amiens where the BEF would be in less danger of being overrun by the Germans coming north of the Meuse. Wilson wrote not just of the difficulties and delays which Kitchener was making but also of “the cowardice of it”, but {{there is little doubt that}} Kitchener was correct. The clash of personalities between Wilson and Kitchener worsened relations between Kitchener and Sir John French, who often took Wilson's advice.|$|E
2500|$|Figure #13 is {{probably}} Diana, {{identified with the}} moon, although some commentators believe {{her to be a}} mere auxiliary troop with #14. [...] Diana holds spears in her left hand and her right hand seems to rest on the head of the man in figure #12, but not gripping his hair as supposed by many. [...] Another identifying feature of Diana is her bountiful hair, bound up for the hunt, and her hunting clothes. [...] Figure #14 might be an auxiliary, but more likely he personifies Mercurius (Mercury/Hermes), identified by his rimmed hat. [...] Mercurius seems to be dragging the female in figure #12 by her hair towards the tropaion. [...] The scene is clearly complex. [...] Many interpretations insist that the ‘auxiliaries’ are dragging the barbarian prisoners to join their kindred in being bound to the trophy. [...] However, there are indications that this might not be the case at all. [...] First, the man on his knees is begging for mercy from Diana, who does look down on him. [...] That same man wears around his neck a torque, suggesting him to be a Celt or German. [...] It may be significant that Diana has her back turned to the observer and possibly the scene itself. [...] She is the only one as such, and perhaps to contrast the celebration of victory in battle, she shows instead mercy to one pleading for his life. [...] In addition, since <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> leader, it makes for better propaganda that he should beg for mercy before a Roman goddess. [...] Mercurius might not be dragging the woman to be bound to the trophy, but might be bringing her to kneel before Diana to beg for mercy as well. [...] She shows the sign of a truce by placing her hand upon her chest. [...] Perhaps Diana and Mercurius are sheltering them, perhaps offering them salvation in the final moments of victory. [...] Whatever the case, the couple in #12 are not comparable to the despairing couple in #11, with whom they appear both to balance and contrast; [...] balance by having barbarians on the right and left, literally balancing the composition, and contrast as one couple being doomed to be bound at the trophy, and the other begging for what looks like a chance of mercy.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{discussing}} the record with Rolling Stone she discussed her selection of producers for the record, {{with a goal}} to create [...] "a unique record" [...] becoming the basis of her selection. After being asked whether there was anyone she wished to work with on the record, Roberts declared that she wanted Kate Bush. However, contacting Bush was difficult; after asking and hinting to her record label during the year she was producing the album, she found that nobody could establish communications. Electropop band Dragonette worked on the album, producing the second single from the album, [...] "Lucky Day". The band {{were among the first}} to work on the record. Roberts co-wrote the lyrics, saying: [...] "When I wrote 'Lucky Day' I had short hair and was really into '40s fashion. All of the 'woah woah woah woah' and the 'ah ha' really is a reflection of that." [...] She also stated when it came to the production of the track, early in 2011, that she wanted to produce a [...] "more downbeat dance record" [...] noting it was what she was into at that point". Roberts worked with producer Diplo, who co-produced the track [...] "Beat of My Drum", she explained whilst talking to The Guardian, [...] "I had to ring him [...] and… you know when you ring a boy for the first time? I knew I only had one chance, so I just fired at him. 'I want this, I want that, don't send it back like that. I'm going to send you the session again just so you've got it.' He reassured me a bit, and I put the phone down, thinking, it's not in my hands now". When Roberts received the track back from Diplo, she was too nervous to listen to it, as it meant so much to her. Whilst back in her hometown of Liverpool she put her younger brother and sister in the car with her, and after burning the track to a CD, drove to a deserted field and played it loudly. After positive responses from the pair, Roberts declared [...] "I'm so proud of it. I can't believe it's mine. <b>The</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> genius". Roberts worked with producer Joseph Mount on the album, recording two songs. For years before the pair started work together, Mount had mentioned several times that he wished to work with Girls Aloud (Roberts' former group), and had sent [...] "short beats" [...] to her, including music which he thought the record label would approve of, as well as a wild-card style compilation. When the two started work in the studio, both of the tracks produced by Mount were chosen from the wild-card category, with lyrics written by Roberts, and the melodies in the tracks produced jointly.|$|E
