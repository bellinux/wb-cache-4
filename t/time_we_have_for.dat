40|$|The {{expression}} and incorporation of retroviral enzymes into virions {{in the form}} of Gag/Pol precursor polyproteins is believed to be important for the assembly of infectious viral particles. HIV- 1 encodes a 160 kDa Gag/Pol precursor that includes Gag, protease (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT) and integrase (IN). <b>We</b> <b>have</b> developed the use of HIV accessory proteins (Vpr and Vpx) as vehicles to incorporate protein of both viral and non-viral origin into virions by expression in trans as heterologous fusion proteins (Wu et al., 1995, 1996 a). To analyze the role of Gag/Pol in the formation of infectious virions, we incorporated RT and IN into HIV- 1 particles in trans, as fusion partners of viral protein R (Vpr). Virions derived from an RT and IN minus proviral clone were infectious and replicated through a complete cycle of infection when RT and IN proteins were provided in trans.

We introduce a new matching heuristic, global greedy heavy edge matching and perform a large number of experiments comparing it to other matching heuristics.

The time scale at which this compression takes place, or in other words the <b>time</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to wait <b>for</b> any input state to become almost indistinguishable from the fixed point, is called the mixing time of the process. Rapid mixing is a condition on the scaling of this mixing time with the system size: if it is logarithmic, then <b>we</b> <b>have</b> rapid mixing.

30|$|Our {{results should}} be {{interpreted}} in light of several limitations. First, {{this study was conducted}} in a single hospital, potentially limiting the generalizability of findings. This is a limitation common to all single-site studies, qualitative and quantitative. The goal of qualitative research is to advance social theory by designing research rigorously that accounts for the unique perspectives of subjects and researchers through robust data analysis, not to posit cause-effect relationships as in statistically-based quantitative research (Mays and Pope 2000). We situate our work within this tradition by presenting the range of stakeholder opinions on cultural competence at one community hospital. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> striven <b>for</b> representativeness by enrolling all relevant stakeholders. Intervention studies that are intended to change human behavior often narrowly select participants and apply narrowly specified strategies that can limit the representativeness of results (Glasgow et al. 2004). Our study aimed for representativeness by broadly enrolling patients, clinicians, and administrators with minimal exclusion criteria and encouraging them to brainstorm strategies for changing human behavior rather than asking them to apply strategies determined by the researchers beforehand. Future qualitative research could explore whether our findings on cultural competence converge or diverge from findings in other clinics. Second, existing relationships among clinicians and administrators could have influenced interactions. Although no single participant dominated any group, perceptions of influence may have encouraged some to participate more than others. Third, we followed methodologists in using theoretical sampling to achieve data saturation. There is no consensus among focus group methodologists on the numbers of participants needed to achieve data saturation among methodologists (Carlsen and Glenton 2011). We believe that our findings exhibit candor and exhaust the range of responses, including contradictions among participants, indicating that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> achieved data saturation.|$|R

Path effects are those differences between traveltimes calculated from tables and the true times that result in epicentre error. The main conclusions of the study are: (1) the estimated variance of the measurement error for P times reported in the REB at large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 0. 04 s 2, {{the bulk of the}} readings being analyst-adjusted automatic-detections, whereas for our times the variance is 0. 01 s 2 and (2) the standard deviation of the path effects for both sets of observations is about 0. 6 s. The study shows that measurement error is about twice (∼ 0. 2 s rather than ∼ 0. 1 s) and path effects about half the values assumed for the REB times. However, uncertainties in the estimated epicentres are poorly described by treating path effects as a random variable with a normal distribution. Only by estimating path effects and using these to correct onset times can reliable estimates of epicentre uncertainty be obtained. There is currently an international programme to do just this. The results imply that with P times from explosions at three or four stations with good SNR (so that the measurement error is around 0. 1 s) and well distributed in azimuth, then with correction for path effects the area of the 90 per cent coverage ellipse should be much less than 1000 km 2 —the area allowed for an on-site inspection under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty—and should cover the true epicentre with the given probability...|$|R
