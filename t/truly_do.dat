5|$|A {{number of}} philosophers, {{including}} Elizabeth Anscombe , Jean Bethke Elshtain , Servais Pinckaers, Iris Murdoch, and the Catholic Encyclopedia, have all {{suggested that the}} Kantian conception of ethics rooted in autonomy is contradictory in its dual contention that humans are co-legislators of morality and that morality is a priori. They argue that if something is universally a priori (i.e., existing unchangingly prior to experience), then it cannot also be in part dependent upon humans, who have not always existed. On the other hand, if humans <b>truly</b> <b>do</b> legislate morality, then they are not bound by it objectively, because they are always free to change it.|$|E
2500|$|OA {{contends that}} the context of powerlessness within the program isn't {{referring}} to an individual's flaws, but simply with the acceptance {{that they have a}} problem with food that they cannot seem to defeat with their unaided will. The slogan [...] "We are powerless, not helpless," [...] is an example of this distinction. By accepting that they are powerless over certain things and thereby surrender the illusion of control, they are then able to make an honest appraisal and make clearer decisions about what they <b>truly</b> <b>do</b> control.|$|E
2500|$|The next day, juror number three—Jennifer Ford, a 32-year-old nursing student—told ABC News, [...] "I {{did not say}} she was innocent" [...] and [...] "I {{just said}} {{there was not enough}} evidence. If you cannot prove what the crime was, you cannot {{determine}} what the punishment should be." [...] She added, [...] "I'm not saying that I believe the defense," [...] but that [...] "it's easier for me logically to get from point A to point B" [...] via the defense argument, as opposed to the prosecution argument. Ford believed George Anthony was [...] "dishonest." [...] She said the jury [...] "was sick to [...] stomachs to get [...] verdict" [...] and that the decision process overwhelmed them {{to the point where they}} did not want to talk to reporters afterwards. Juror number two, a 46-year-old male who requested to stay unidentified, told the St. Petersburg Times that [...] "everybody agreed if we were going fully on feelings and emotions, [...] was done". He stated that a lack of evidence was the reason for the not-guilty verdict: [...] "I just swear to God... I wish we had more evidence to put her away. I <b>truly</b> <b>do...</b> But it wasn't there." [...] He also said that Anthony was [...] "not a good person in my opinion". Juror number six, identified by WTSP as Brian Berling, told gossip website TMZ.com that he was willing to be interviewed [...] "so long as the opportunities are paid".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have spoken}} <b>truly.</b> <b>Do</b> you speak as truly. You {{should be as}} much above false girlish petty scruples, as you will be and are above {{falsehood}} of another kind. You will never tell a man that you love him if you do not." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "An' that I will <b>truly</b> <b>do,</b> Peter of Colfax," [...] spoke Bertrade, [...] "if {{you do not}} {{immediately}} send for my friends to conduct me from thy castle, for I will not step my foot from this room until I know that mine own people stand without." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bib. Did you mark that, Frances? There was wit now; he call'd me cuckold to my face, and yet for {{my heart}} I cannot {{be angry with}} him.

2500|$|This sort of [...] "inflation of resistance" [...] is {{dangerous}} because {{it suggests that}} the Jews <b>truly</b> <b>did</b> present the Nazis {{with some sort of}} [...] "opposition" [...] that was not just a horrible figment of their antisemitic imaginations.|$|R

6000|$|I. The {{first of}} these ways, the saints, though they <b>truly</b> <b>do</b> depart from iniquity, yet depart not from it as they should. (1.) Their {{understanding}} sees not the utmost baseness that is in it. (2.) Their judgment is not informed about the vileness of it to perfection. (3.) The conscience {{has not yet been}} convinced of all the evil that is in it. Then, (a.) How should the soul abhor it as it should? (b.) How should the desires depart from it with that fervency as they should? (c.) And the will and affections so turn away from it as they should? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God," [...] said Rebecca, [...] "is the {{disposer}} of all. He {{can turn}} back the captivity of Judah, even by the weakest instrument. To execute his message the snail is as sure a messenger as the falcon. Seek out Isaac of York--here is that will pay for horse and man--let him have this scroll.--I know not if it be of Heaven the spirit which inspires me, but most <b>truly</b> <b>do</b> I judge that I am not to die this death, and that a champion will be raised up for me.

"Rupert Sent Leger, {{before we}} {{go a step further}} I must say {{something}} to you, ask you something, and I charge you, on your most sacred honour and belief, to answer me <b>truly.</b> <b>Do</b> you believe me {{to be one of those}} unhappy beings who may not die, but have to live in shameful existence between earth and the nether world, and whose hellish mission is to destroy, body and soul, those who love them till they fall to their level?

I am heartily sorry now, boy, that I {{had a hand in}} {{carrying}} you off, though maybe it is best for you that it has been so. If I hadn't taken you someone else would, and more than likely you would not have fared so well as you have done, for some of them would have saved themselves all further trouble and risk, by chucking you overboard {{as soon as they were}} well out of the Pool." ...|$|E
50|$|On {{the topic}} of his {{daughter}} and men, he tells her to love only one man and to love him well. This does not match his own actions in that he has loved so many women, but he <b>truly</b> <b>does</b> want his daughter {{to have a good}} man that cares for her.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Ascension - Dream State Armageddon" [...] deal with {{waking up and}} {{realising}} that everything is a hologram, {{but there is a}} danger that if you <b>truly</b> <b>did</b> find the key to unlock the mystery of the universe, everything would implode.

60|$|<b>Truly</b> <b>do</b> {{we carry}} in us, each human of us alive {{on the planet}} to-day, the incorruptible history of life from life's beginning. This history is written in our tissues and our bones, in our {{functions}} and our organs, in our brain cells and in our spirits, and {{in all sorts of}} physical and psychic atavistic urgencies and compulsions. Once we were fish-like, you and I, my reader, and crawled up out of the sea to pioneer in the great, dry-land adventure in the thick of which we are now. The marks of the sea are still on us, as the marks of the serpent are still on us, ere the serpent became serpent and we became we, when pre-serpent and pre-we were one. Once we flew in the air, and once we dwelt arboreally and were afraid of the dark. The vestiges remain, graven on you and me, and graven on our seed to come after us to the end of our time on earth.|$|E
6000|$|Let {{it not be}} {{supposed}} that I am proposing to narrow medical education, or, as the cry is, to lower the standard of the profession.

Moreover, I venture to say, that any man who has seriously studied all the essential branches of medical knowledge; who has the needful acquaintance with the elements of physical science; who has been brought by medical jurisprudence into contact with law; whose study of insanity has taken him into the fields of psychology; has ipso facto received a liberal education.|$|E
