40|$|Abstract. The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} XML Web services motivates us to examine {{if it is}} feasible to substitute one vendor service for another when using a Web-based application, assuming that these services are “derived from ” a common base. If such substitution were possible, end users could use the same application {{with a variety of}} back-end vendor services, and the vendors themselves could compete on price, quality, availability, etc. Interoperability <b>with</b> <b>substituted</b> services is non-trivial, however, and four types of incompatibilities may arise during such interoperation – structural, value, encoding and semantic. We address these incompatibilities three-fold: (1) static and dynamic analysis tools to infer whether an application is compatible <b>with</b> a <b>substituted</b> service, (2) semiautomatically generated middleware components called cross-stubs that actually resolve incompatibilities and enable interoperation <b>with</b> <b>substituted</b> services, and (3) a lightweight mechanism called multi-option types to enable applications to be written from the ground up in an interoperation-friendly manner. Using real applications and services as examples, we both demonstrate and evaluate our tools and techniques for enabling interoperation <b>with</b> <b>substituted</b> services. ...|$|R
