5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> was changing significantly. At times <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> could be changed on the pad. <b>The</b> <b>engines,</b> drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>engines</b> {{would not}} be reusable, as they would be {{permanently}} attached to the discarded stages.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> thrust acts along <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> centreline. <b>The</b> {{aircraft}} [...] "holds" [...] <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> on <b>the</b> {{outer casing}} of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> at {{some distance from}} <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> centreline (at <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> mounts). This arrangement causes <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> casing to bend (known as backbone bending) and the round rotor casings to distort (ovalization). Distortion of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> structure has to be controlled with suitable mount locations to maintain acceptable rotor and seal clearances and prevent rubbing. A well-publicized example of excessive structural deformation occurred with the original Pratt & Whitney JT9D <b>engine</b> installation in <b>the</b> Boeing 747 aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> mounting arrangement had to be revised {{with the addition of}} an extra thrust frame to reduce the casing deflections to an acceptable amount.|$|R
50|$|The YF120's {{variable}} cycle {{system worked}} by varying the bypass ratio of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> for different flight regimes, allowing <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{to act like}} either a low bypass turbofan or nearly a turbojet. As a low bypass turbofan (like competitor F119), <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> performed similarly to comparable engines. When needed, however, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> could direct more airflow through the hot core of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> (like a turbojet), increasing the specific thrust of <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> This made <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> more efficient at high altitude, high thrust levels than a traditional low bypass turbofan.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> crane is {{commonly}} used in combination with <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> stand so that <b>the</b> removed <b>engine</b> can be rotated in midair {{to provide access to}} underside surfaces of <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
5|$|The race's honorary grand marshal was skateboarder Tony Hawk, {{who gave}} the command to start <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both Tigers {{suffered}} early mechanical failures, {{and neither}} finished the race. <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> {{had been prepared}} by Shelby but had not been properly developed, {{and as a result}} overheated; Shelby eventually refunded the development cost to Rootes. All three of the Le Mans Tigers have survived.|$|E
5|$|Early {{versions}} of the Su-25 were equipped with two R95Sh non-afterburning turbojets, in compartments {{on either side of}} the rear fuselage. <b>The</b> <b>engines,</b> sub-assemblies and surrounding fuselage are cooled by air provided by the cold air intakes on top of the engine nacelles. A drainage system collects oil, hydraulic fluid residues and fuel from <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> after flight or after an unsuccessful start. The engine control systems allows independent operation of each engine. The latest versions (Su-25T and TM) are equipped with improved R-195 engines.|$|E
40|$|Various {{types of}} faults of <b>the</b> {{gasoline}} <b>engine</b> {{may result in}} similar symptoms. Sound analysis of engine has been conducted to diagnose <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> faults. This study presents a study of sound analysis of <b>the</b> normal <b>engine</b> and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> with three different fault conditions. <b>The</b> gasoline <b>engine</b> was our target of this study. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> sound has been recorded by using a microphone at <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> room for three directions. Three conditions of <b>engine</b> faults including <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> that is not smooth while idling, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> that goes missing while idling and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> that has no power are simulated. In the signal processing of the sound, we use five signal features including fundamental frequency, long term spectrum, energy, long term cestrum and zero crossing rate. Thereafter, the important differences between normal <b>engine</b> and <b>the</b> fault <b>engines</b> are concluded. These proposed signal features {{can be used to}} discriminate all three conditions and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> with normal condition effectively...|$|R
50|$|In {{some cases}} in jet <b>engines</b> <b>the</b> {{conditions}} in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> due to airflow entering <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> or other variations {{can cause the}} compressor blades to stall. When this occurs the pressure in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> blows out past the blades, and the stall is maintained until the pressure has decreased, and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> has lost all thrust. The compressor blades will then usually come out of stall, and re-pressurize <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> If conditions are not corrected, the cycle will usually repeat. This is called surge. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> this can be highly damaging to <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> and creates worrying vibrations for the crew.|$|R

5|$|For a {{study for}} the U.S. Air Force in the mid-1970s, Boeing {{investigated}} replacing <b>the</b> <b>engines,</b> changing to a new wing, and other improvements to upgrade B-52G/H aircraft {{as an alternative to}} the B-1A, then in development.|$|E
5|$|Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} {{racing is}} the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, {{which has been}} divided into three classes since 1990: 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 50cc/80cc and sidecar. The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship. The 350cc class existed from 1949 until 1982. The 350cc referred {{to the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> of the motorcycles that participated in the class. <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> had four cylinders, similar to the types of engines used in MotoGP today.|$|E
5|$|Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} {{racing is}} the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, {{which has been}} divided into three classes since 1990: 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Former classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 50cc/80cc and Sidecar. 250cc is the intermediate category; the 250cc refers {{to the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> of the motorcycles that race in that class. <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> have twin cylinders, as opposed to the four cylinders used in MotoGP. The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship. The 250cc class was replaced in 2010 by a new class called Moto2. The 250cc engines were replaced by 600cc engines, which were supplied by Honda to all teams.|$|E
50|$|If a {{cylinder}} fills with liquid while <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is turned off, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> will refuse to turn when a starting cycle is attempted. Since the starter mechanism's torque is normally {{much lower than}} <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> operating torque and momentum this will usually not damage <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> but may burn out <b>the</b> starter. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> can be drained as above and restarted. If a corrosive substance such as water has been in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> long enough to cause rusting, more extensive repairs will be required.|$|R
50|$|The path of ions and {{electrons}} through <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> approximates lines {{parallel to}} <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> walls; however, <b>the</b> particles actually orbit those lines while traveling linearly through <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> <b>The</b> final, diverging, section of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> contains an expanding magnetic field {{that drives the}} ions and electrons in steadily expanding spirals and ejects them from <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> parallel and opposite to the direction of motion at velocities as great as 50,000 m/s.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, {{there was}} <b>the</b> Cadillac Northstar <b>engine</b> series, which {{featured}} a [...] "limp home" [...] fail-safe mode. If <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> lost coolant, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> controller could cause <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{to run on}} half of the cylinders, alternating between banks. This would air-cool <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> allowing it to drive up to 100 miles without coolant.|$|R
5|$|In March 2012 a team {{of specialists}} financed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos located the F-1 engines that {{launched}} Apollo 11 into space. <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> were found below the Atlantic Ocean's surface {{through the use of}} advanced sonar scanning. His team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface. In July 2013, a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one of <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> raised from the Atlantic, which NASA confirmed was from the Apollo 11 launch.|$|E
5|$|On 7 October 1964, Vulcan B.2 XM601 crashed during {{overshoot}} from an asymmetric power practice approach at Coningsby. The copilot had executed the asymmetric {{power approach}} with two engines producing thrust and two at idle. He was being checked by the Squadron Commander, who was {{unfamiliar with the}} aircraft. When he commenced the overshoot the copilot moved all the throttles to full power. <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> that had been producing power reached full power more quickly than <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> at idle and the resultant asymmetric thrust exceeded the available rudder authority, causing the aircraft to spin and crash. All the crew perished.|$|E
5|$|On this occasion, {{an unknown}} number of fire engines were either wheeled or dragged through the streets, some from across the City. The piped water had already failed which they were {{designed}} to use, but parts of the river bank could still be reached. Gangs of men tried desperately to manoeuvre <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> right up to the river to fill their reservoirs, and several of <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> toppled into the Thames. The heat from the flames by then was too great for the remaining engines to get within a useful distance; they could not even get into Pudding Lane.|$|E
50|$|In a turbofan, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{is started}} when {{compressed}} air is blown through its high-pressure stages. In a turboprop, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is {{started by the}} starter-generator, which is <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> own electric generator - during the start, an electric current runs through it, making it spin, and then making <b>the</b> whole <b>engine</b> turn. In both cases, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> must be already spinning before igniting the fuel, so as to have the compressors attain enough speed to draw air and make it flow though <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> When there is a sufficient amount of air flowing, the fuel is injected, and then <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{will be able to}} run by itself.|$|R
5000|$|A valve is briefly opened {{relieving}} {{the pressure}} inside <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> This prepares <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> for <b>the</b> next stroke. The flywheel provides energy to push <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> into <b>the</b> next stroke.|$|R
5000|$|The racing {{version of}} <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> {{produced}} approximately [...] with its power {{limited by the}} intake restrictors required by racing regulations. For the road-version of <b>the</b> <b>engine,</b> <b>the</b> restrictors were not needed so <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> was developed without them.|$|R
5|$|Placing <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> {{within the}} wings had the {{advantage}} of a reduction in the risk of foreign object damage, which could seriously damage jet engines. The low-mounted engines and good placement of service panels also made aircraft maintenance easier to perform. However, the Comet's buried engine configuration increased its structural weight and complexity. Armour had to be placed around the engine cells to contain debris from any serious engine failures; also, placing <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> inside the wing required a more complicated wing structure.|$|E
5|$|Prost {{became the}} {{president}} of Prost Grand Prix {{at the start of}} 1998. With Peugeot supplying <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> for Prost GP, Mugen-Honda decided to supply the Jordan team. Prost GP scored a single point during the season, Jarno Trulli finishing sixth in Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 was envisioned to {{fly from}} forward air bases and semi-prepared runways with {{high risk of}} foreign object damage to <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b> The unusual {{location}} of the General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines decreases ingestion risk, and allows <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> to run while the aircraft is serviced and rearmed by ground crews, reducing turn-around time. The wings are also mounted closer to the ground, simplifying servicing and rearming operations. The heavy engines require strong supports: four bolts connect the engine pylons to the airframe. The engines' high 6:1 bypass ratio contributes to a relatively small infrared signature, and their position directs exhaust over the tailplanes further shielding it from detection by infrared homing surface-to-air missiles. <b>The</b> <b>engines</b> and exhausts are angled upward by nine degrees to cancel out the nose-down pitching moment that would otherwise generate from being mounted above the aircraft's center of gravity and avoids the need to trim the control surfaces to prevent pitching.|$|E
50|$|In 1997, Coltrane {{appeared}} {{in a series of}} six programmes under the title Coltrane's Planes and Automobiles, in which he extolled the virtues of <b>the</b> steam <b>engine,</b> <b>the</b> diesel <b>engine,</b> <b>the</b> supercharger, <b>the</b> V8 <b>engine,</b> <b>the</b> two-stroke <b>engine,</b> and <b>the</b> jet <b>engine.</b> In these programmes he dismantled and rebuilt several engines. He also single-handedly removed <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> from a Trabant car in 23 minutes.|$|R
5000|$|The 6-71 is a {{two stroke}} diesel <b>engine.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> will not {{naturally}} aspirate, air is provided to <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> via a roots-type supercharger. However, on the 6-71T models, both a turbocharger and a supercharger are utilized. Fuel {{is provided by}} Unit Injectors, one per cylinder. The amount of fuel injected into <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is controlled by <b>the</b> <b>engine's</b> governor. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> cooling is via liquid in a water jacket. In a boat, external cool water is pumped through the boat and passed through a heat exchanger mounted on or nearby <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> in a [...] "double loop" [...] configuration.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the fuel}} energy loss in cars occurs in the {{thermodynamic}} losses of <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b> <b>The</b> next biggest loss is from idling, or when <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> is in standby, which explains the large gains available from shutting off <b>the</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|R
5|$|The AH-64A is the {{original}} production attack helicopter. The crew sit in tandem in an armored compartment. It is powered by two GE T700 turboshaft engines.

5|$|The Il-40 first flew on 7 March 1953, {{and flight}} tests {{revealed}} no serious shortcomings in the air. The operational CG {{was too far}} aft, but this was only a minor problem when landing, taking off and taxiing, especially when coupled with the rather short wheelbase. The biggest problem {{proved to be the}} guns and their effect on <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b> During the first aerial test of the cannons at the end of March 1953 the muzzle flash temporarily blinded the pilot and both engines flamed out. The pilot was able to restart <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> and returned safely, but Sergey Ilyushin immediately started an investigation into the cause of the engine problems. Ground tests with high-speed cameras revealed that none of the muzzle brakes or blast suppressors tested made any difference; <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> would hiccup even if only a single gun fired just five to ten rounds.|$|E
5|$|The JV6 engines {{used in the}} Jaguar racing {{cars were}} {{produced}} by Swiss engineer Max Heidegger, but delivering the number of engines required for the XJ220 program was considered beyond his capacity. TWR formed a division, TWR Road Engines, to manage the design, development, construction and testing of <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> for the production cars. The JV6 engine used in the XJ220 featured little commonality with <b>the</b> <b>engines</b> Heidegger built {{for use in the}} XJR racing cars, being specifically engineered to meet performance and in particular, the European emissions requirements, which the race engines didn't have to meet.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> is a {{modified}} version of <b>the</b> road cars <b>engine.</b> Including lightened and balanced internals, re-profiled cylinder heads and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> management system tuned for race use. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> would now produce , [...] more than the standard road car.|$|R
50|$|On 20 June 1873 a {{mechanical}} failure befell <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> hauling <b>the</b> Adelaide-Kapunda train near Smithfield. A tyre on <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> broke. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> was derailed and goods and passenger wagons were smashed.|$|R
40|$|Vibration {{analysis}} of engine faults is {{an approach to}} diagnose <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> condition. This study presents a study of vibration {{analysis of}} <b>the</b> normal <b>engine</b> and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> with three different fault conditions. <b>The</b> gasoline <b>engine</b> was selected in this study. The accelerometer has been used at the surface of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> to measure <b>the</b> vibration {{in the form of}} acceleration for all possible directions. Three conditions of <b>engine</b> faults including <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> that is not smooth while idling, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> that goes missing while idling and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> that has no power are selected. Five vibration signal parameters including fundamental frequency, long term spectrum, energy, long term cepstrum and zero crossing rate, are computed from all databases. The significant differences between normal <b>engine</b> and <b>the</b> fault <b>engines</b> are concluded.
