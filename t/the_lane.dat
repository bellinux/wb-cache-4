5|$|Only {{a few of}} {{the other}} {{buildings}} have names. Building 200 is officially <b>the</b> <b>Lane</b> History Corner, named for Bill and Jean Lane in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The {{increase}} in maximum bandwidth {{is achieved by}} raising <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> speed from 6 Gbit/s to 12 Gbit/s and {{increasing the number of}} AV data lanes from 3 to 4 (i.e. using all 4 lanes to carry data). The data lanes runs in inverted clock mode and embeds the clock signal in itself. This allows the clock lane to be used for data (in addition to the existing three data lanes). <b>The</b> <b>lane</b> data structure has been changed to a packet-based format. <b>The</b> <b>lane</b> encoding is changed from 8b/10b to 16b/18b (reducing the overhead from 20% to 11%).|$|E
50|$|To reduce {{confusion}} regarding <b>the</b> left-turn <b>lane,</b> <b>the</b> left-turn <b>lane</b> and <b>the</b> straight-through <b>lanes</b> {{are usually}} {{separated by a}} concrete barrier or traffic island. This diagram shows <b>the</b> straight-through <b>lanes</b> offset by one <b>lane</b> through <b>the</b> intersection and are guided by lines painted through the intersection. But {{this is just a}} sample configuration; <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> may be offset by more lanes or none at all.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> left <b>lane</b> is {{commonly}} referred to as the [...] "fast lane", but that is not an accurate description of <b>the</b> <b>lane's</b> purpose. <b>The</b> left <b>lane</b> is <b>the</b> designated passing <b>lane,</b> however, vehicles in <b>the</b> left <b>lane</b> must obey <b>the</b> posted speed limits. A common problem arising from misuse of <b>the</b> left <b>lane</b> is speeding and tailgating. These actions create road rage and increase overall danger.|$|R
3000|$|... {{is set to}} be 3. <b>The</b> <b>lanes</b> in <b>the</b> network {{are divided}} into cells with length of 7.5 [*]m. The {{capacity}} of <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> equals to <b>the</b> number of the cells.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lane</b> is a {{restricted}} {{area in which}} players can stay for only {{a limited amount of}} time. On all levels, a team on the offensive (in possession of the ball) is prohibited to stay inside <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> for more than three seconds; after three seconds the player will be called with a three-second violation which will result in a turnover.|$|E
5|$|No player along <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> {{may enter}} the key until the shot is released; the player {{shooting}} the free throw, and anyone {{on top of}} the key, should not pass the free throw line until the ball hits the rim. If any of the offensive players violate the rule, no points are awarded for the shot and, if there are no more shots remaining, the ball is given to the defending team. If a defending player is in <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> too soon, an extra shot will be awarded regardless of whether the shot was made or missed.|$|E
5|$|On June 8, 2008 the {{congregation}} dedicated its new building at 1175 East 29th Avenue. At approximately , the facility included a sanctuary, commercial kitchen, banquet facilities, and classrooms, and housed the synagogue, <b>the</b> <b>Lane</b> County Jewish Federation, {{and the local}} Jewish Family Service. The project ended up costing $6 million, of which $4 million had been raised.|$|E
2500|$|Interstate5 has [...] of {{reversible}} express <b>lanes</b> within Seattle. <b>The</b> express <b>lanes</b> begin after <b>the</b> Yesler Way {{bridge and}} tunnel under <b>the</b> northbound <b>lanes</b> of I-5 and intersect Cherry Street/Columbia Street. From the interchange, <b>the</b> express <b>lanes</b> intersect Mercer Street and then cross the Ship Canal Bridge. [...] <b>The</b> express <b>lanes</b> are on <b>the</b> lower deck below <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> of I-5. [...] Near {{the end of}} the bridge is a reversible ramp that accesses Northeast 42nd Street. [...] After the bridge ends, <b>the</b> express <b>lanes</b> continue northbound and intersect with Ravenna Boulevard, Lake City Way, and Northeast 103rd Street/1st Avenue Northeast. [...] Finally, <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> merge with I-5 in Northgate just north of the Northgate Mall.|$|R
50|$|The {{speed limit}} on <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> was {{increased}} from 55 mph to 65 mph on June 24, 2013, after a VDOT study concluded an increase would {{not pose a}} safety risk. Transportation officials said they always expected the speed limit to be increased, but they needed to open <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> with a 55 mph speed limit to observe how <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> operated and to assess whether the limit could be increased.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> current <b>lane</b> {{state was}} {{indicated}} by indicator lights on <b>the</b> <b>lane's</b> controller. Up to 10 packages in 30-second intervals {{could be sent}} on <b>the</b> same <b>lane</b> at once, although this was rarely used in practice.|$|R
5|$|Twombly {{was born}} to Samuel Twombly and Dorothy Twombly (nee Wilder) on February 21, 1842, near Farmington, Van Buren County, Iowa Territory. His father died in September 1842, leaving Twombly's mother {{responsible}} for raising him. While growing up, Twombly was educated at several common schools and at <b>the</b> <b>Lane</b> Academy of Keosauqua.|$|E
5|$|What is now Park Lane was {{originally}} a track running along farm boundaries. When Hyde Park was {{opened in the}} 16th century, <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> ran north-south along eastern boundary from Piccadilly to Marble Arch.|$|E
5|$|Dedicated bus lanes {{have existed}} on the Kwinana Freeway {{since the late}} 1980s, when a project {{was set up to}} {{decrease}} bus commuters' travel times into Perth from suburbs south of the Swan River. In 1987, Main Roads Western Australia and Transperth trialled a contraflow bus lane along the Kwinana Freeway, from the Canning Interchange to the Narrows Interchange. <b>The</b> <b>lane</b> operated between 7:00 am and 9:30 am, the period with the most traffic congestion on the freeway. After two months, the results were examined, and the agencies decided to build an additional bus lane on the northbound carriageway. The construction included bus-only ramps {{at the beginning and end}} of <b>the</b> <b>lane.</b> The works were mainly funded by Transperth, which contributed $8.22 million out of the $10.23 million total cost. The remaining $2.01 million was provided by Main Roads Western Australia. The bus lane opened on 20 November 1989, and received an Institute of Engineers award for engineering excellence.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> HOT <b>lanes</b> were {{complete}} in December 2014, but <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> stretch from {{just north of}} Edsall Road to Garrisonville ...|$|R
30|$|Optimize {{compliance}} zone: On {{the straight}} motorway, in the beginning, an artificial bottleneck {{was created by}} letting the scenario start with an unequal distribution of vehicles over <b>the</b> <b>lanes.</b> <b>The</b> distribution in that scenario was skewed towards <b>the</b> left <b>lane</b> as described in [17]. Upon entry of the optimize compliance zone, equipped vehicles received a lane change advice in order to equalize the distribution of vehicles over <b>the</b> <b>lanes.</b> <b>The</b> number of vehicles that received a lane change advice was computed {{in such a way}} that as a result of compliance an equal distribution over <b>the</b> three <b>lanes</b> would be achieved.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> four <b>lane</b> road splits into {{a divided}} highway and descends below Evans Avenue. The highway weaves through a {{complicated}} interchange, providing northbound access to Evans Avenue and the Gardiner Expressway, and southbound access to The Queensway, QEW / Gardiner Expressway, and Evans Avenue. North of <b>the</b> interchange, <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> from Brown's Line diverge and form <b>the</b> collector <b>lanes</b> of a collector-express system. Flyover ramps {{to and from}} the QEW / Gardiner pass over <b>the</b> southbound <b>lanes</b> and converge to form <b>the</b> express <b>lanes.</b> This collector-express system serves to divide local traffic from freeway-to-freeway traffic; <b>the</b> express <b>lanes</b> provide access between the QEW / Gardiner Expressway and Highway401, while <b>the</b> collector <b>lanes</b> provide local access between those interchanges.|$|R
5|$|Fairfax {{wrote that}} his second-in-command, Major-General Lambert, {{could not get}} up to him, and so charged in another place. A lane, the present-day Atterwith Lane, crossed the ditch on this flank, and some {{accounts}} suggest that several units were easy targets for the Royalist musketeers as they advanced along <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> only four abreast. When a small embankment alongside the ditch at this point was removed in the 1960s, several hundred musket balls were recovered.|$|E
5|$|Farewell Great Macedon (also {{known as}} Alexander the Great in the script's early stages) was a six-part story pitched for Season 1 and {{was written by}} Moris Farhi. In the story, the Doctor and his companions are framed for murder {{as part of a}} {{conspiracy}} to kill Alexander the Great and must pass a number of trials, including walking on hot coals, to gain the trust of his bodyguard Ptolemy. The script was published by Nothing at the End of <b>the</b> <b>Lane</b> in October 2009. It was later adapted by Nigel Robinson for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in November 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{construction}} was started to widen I-94/I-69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge {{and to allow}} for dedicated local traffic and bridge traffic lanes. <b>The</b> <b>lane</b> configuration changes confused drivers in the area, especially motorists with outdated GPS devices; because of this, MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to help prevent drivers from heading to Canada by mistake.|$|E
50|$|In early 2014, the City of Pittsburgh {{announced}} {{the installation of}} the first set of protected bike <b>lanes</b> in <b>the</b> area. After deliberation, it was decided that Penn Avenue would be the candidate for <b>the</b> <b>lanes.</b> <b>The</b> eastbound <b>lane</b> of Penn Avenue was removed from the David McCullough Bridge to 6th Street in Downtown to provide protected bike <b>lanes.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lanes</b> have provided bikers with a safe and effective way of leaving Downtown.|$|R
2500|$|Each of <b>the</b> travel <b>lanes</b> in <b>the</b> Lincoln Tunnel's center tube is reversible. In general, both of <b>the</b> <b>lanes,</b> {{including}} one [...] "XBL" [...] (Exclusive Bus Lane), serve Manhattan-bound traffic during the weekday morning rush hour, both of <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> serve New Jersey-bound traffic during the weekday evening rush hour, and one lane {{is provided in}} each direction during other time periods.|$|R
2500|$|Interstate 90 had a [...] long {{reversible}} express lane {{that went}} across Lake Washington from Seattle to Bellevue. <b>The</b> express <b>lane</b> started at two different locations, {{one at the}} southern terminus of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel and the other at a signalled intersection at 5th Avenue S., S. Dearborn Street, and Seattle Blvd. <b>The</b> <b>lanes</b> turned east and travel in a separated right-of-way before traveling towards the middle of I-90 east of the interchange with I-5. This section was bi-directional, containing two lanes separated by a barrier, and allows buses to use <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> in both directions at all times. [...] From there, <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> traveled through <b>the</b> Mount Baker Tunnel and onto the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge, sharing the bridge with <b>the</b> westbound <b>lanes.</b> From there, <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> traveled through Mercer Island and ends at its terminus with the I-90 interchange with Bellevue Way, with ramps connecting to mainline I-90 and I-405.|$|R
5|$|Mikan {{became so}} {{dominant}} that the NBA {{had to change}} its rules of play {{in order to reduce}} his influence, such as widening <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> from six to twelve feet ("The Mikan Rule"). He also {{played a role in the}} introduction of the shot clock; and in the NCAA, his dominating play around the basket led to the outlawing of defensive goaltending. Mikan was a harbinger of the NBA's future, which would be dominated by tall, powerful players.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{property}} {{on the road}} becoming more desirable, traffic began to increase on Park Lane during the 19th century. A short section of <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> was widened in 1851 {{as part of the}} redevelopment work on Marble Arch. In July 1866, following the destruction of the boundary railings after a demonstration supporting the Second Reform Bill, the road was widened as far as Stanhope Gate. In 1871, Hamilton Place was widened to allow an alternative traffic flow to Piccadilly.|$|E
5|$|Salta {{can only}} be {{accessed}} from <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> from Mawbray, which goes on to join the B5300 coast road, although two public bridleways provide access over the fields from Hailforth and Mawbray. The hamlet consists of mainly bungalows, and a farm is still in operation in the vicinity. A caravan park, Manor House Park, is situated across the Moss to the southeast, to the southwest of the hamlet of Edderside.|$|E
5000|$|Construction of the [...] "dual freeway" [...] {{began in}} early 2002, {{at a cost}} of $182 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ). <b>The</b> {{northbound}} <b>lanes</b> were scheduled to open in February 2006. <b>The</b> southbound <b>lanes</b> were completed in early 2007. That year, a three-year project began to allow robot controlled vehicles, including buses and trucks, to use a special <b>lane.</b> <b>The</b> intention is to allow the vehicles to travel at shorter following distances and thereby allow more vehicles to use <b>the</b> <b>lanes.</b> <b>The</b> vehicles will still have drivers since they need to enter and exit <b>the</b> special <b>lanes.</b> <b>The</b> system was designed by Swoop Technology, based in San Diego County.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lanes</b> in both {{directions}} are listed below.|$|R

5|$|Southcote {{is within}} Thames Valley Police's catchment, and is grouped as a {{neighbourhood}} with Norcot. Residents identified nuisance and illegal parking and excessive speed as {{of concern in}} the area, {{as well as the}} antisocial use of mini motos, quad bikes and motorcycles on the Kennet towpath. Measures to alleviate nuisance parking were introduced in early 2015 with a ban on parking on the road verge. In June 2015, signs were installed on <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> to Southcote Mill to warn motorcycle users of their prohibition on that right of way.|$|E
5|$|The section {{immediately}} {{south of}} Highway401 is often congested at all hours. Traffic studies have attributed congestion in the southbound lanes {{to the number}} of lanes merging from Highways401 and404 into the parkway and <b>the</b> <b>lane</b> changing that results from merging traffic from Highway401 clashing with exiting traffic to the nearby York Mills exit. Congestion in the northbound lanes is attributed to truck traffic coping with the steep grade of the valley, lane changing, and insufficient advanced signage for Highway401. Most traffic in this section travels north on Highway404, but only two of the five lanes lead to it.|$|E
5|$|They {{were usually}} joined by other local children, {{two of whom}} became elite sportsmen: Allan Ruthven (an Australian rules footballer) and Harold Shillinglaw (both an Australian rules footballer and {{first-class}} cricketer)the group also played Australian rules football, kicking around rolled up cardboard and newspaper. Much of the batting skill displayed by the Harvey brothers {{has been attributed to}} these games played on the unpredictable bounce of the bumpy laneway. The surface also had a V-shaped slope inwards towards the centre of <b>the</b> <b>lane,</b> causing balls to deviate sideways after bouncing.|$|E
30|$|Lateral {{movements}} are mainly considered in lane changing movements in PTV VISSIM. There {{are two main}} lane change types considered - which lane is changing from <b>the</b> fast <b>lane</b> to <b>the</b> slow <b>lane</b> and from <b>the</b> slow <b>lane</b> to <b>the</b> fast <b>lane</b> - which are highly considered in [22].|$|R
50|$|In 2000, I-95 was {{completely}} rebuilt between US 202 and the Pennsylvania border. The reconstruction completely tore apart the concrete pavement {{and replaced it}} with asphalt and also improved drainage and rebuilt bridges. In April 2000, <b>the</b> southbound <b>lanes</b> were closed, with <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> between DE 3 and US 202 reopening in May and the remainder reopening in mid-summer. In July, <b>the</b> northbound <b>lanes</b> were closed, with <b>the</b> <b>lanes</b> reopening between US 202 and DE 3 in September and the remainder reopening in October. During the closure, through traffic was detoured to I-495.|$|R
50|$|On November 17, 2012, {{following}} {{removal of}} <b>the</b> bicycle <b>lanes,</b> <b>the</b> reversible centre <b>lane</b> reopened.|$|R
