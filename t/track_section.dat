5|$|The town {{is close}} {{to the site of the}} Radstock rail accident, a rail crash that took place on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, on 7 August 1876. Two trains {{collided}} on a single <b>track</b> <b>section,</b> resulting in the deaths of 15passengers.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, a {{team from}} the University of Cambridge began {{conducting}} a study in a short, double <b>track</b> <b>section</b> of unused tunnel near the platforms where a newly built tunnel for Crossrail is situated almost two metres beneath. The study is to establish how the original cast-iron lining sections, which {{are similar to those}} used for many miles of railway under London, resist possible deformation and soil movement caused by the developments.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} suggests, Green Lantern is themed for the DC Comics {{character}} of the same name. The theme was chosen {{to coincide with the}} Green Lantern film scheduled for release in 2011. The track is painted green, {{with the exception of the}} yellow vertical loop. The second corkscrew was originally the <b>track</b> <b>section</b> which was going to be yellow, but it was decided to switch the scheme to the first loop. The loop is yellow because Green Lantern's enemy is the yellow Parallax. In June 2011, a Parallax cutout with clutching arms through which the train passes was placed at the bottom of the first drop. The ride's queue area features a series of comic-book-style boards relating the story of Hal Jordan (the Green Lantern) and the Green Lantern Corps.|$|E

5|$|Each of Hollywood Dream's 5 trains carry 36 {{riders in}} nine coaches, each having {{a row of}} four seats. All trains have an {{on-board}} audio and lighting system, with each seat having a headrest stereo sound system capable of playing one of five songs selected by the rider with a control panel inserted into the seat's restraining lap bar. The on-board audio and lighting system animates LED lights that are built into the trains' sides and front riderless pilot coach. The lighting program varies as the train moves, with different animations for different track sections and the station. The lighting pattern used for the park entrance <b>track</b> <b>section</b> gives {{the effect of a}} Comet with a sparkling head and glittering trail of light.|$|E
5|$|From Illawarra Junction, four tracks {{head south}} through Erskineville and St Peters to Sydenham station. The 'main' pair of tracks {{are used by}} Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line and South Coast Line trains and the 'local' pair by Bankstown Line and peak hour Airport, Inner West & South Line trains. At Sydenham, the Bankstown railway line {{branches}} off, but trains from the Airport, Inner West & South Line continue along the Illawarra line until Wolli Creek, where a junction to the East Hills line exists. South of Wolli Creek station, a crossover allows trains from the 'main' pair of tracks to switch to the 'local' pair. This is used by peak hour all-stations Eastern Suburbs & Illawarra Line trains. The four <b>track</b> <b>section</b> ends at Hurstville. The line then continues as two tracks south towards Sutherland, crossing the Georges River via the Como railway bridge between Oatley and Como. At Sutherland the Cronulla line branches in an easterly direction.|$|E

25|$|Both trains were on {{the same}} section of single track that runs between the Chatsworth station (which is double tracked) through the Santa Susana Pass. The line returns to double track again as it enters the Simi Valley. Three tunnels under the pass are only wide enough to support a single track, and it would be very costly to widen them. This single <b>track</b> <b>section</b> carries 24 {{passenger}} trains and 12 freight trains each day.|$|E
25|$|Between Bewdley North and Bewdley South {{the double}} <b>track</b> <b>section</b> through {{platforms}} 1 & 2 is signalled with absolute block. The single track through platform 3 is signalled with direction lever. The line furthest {{from the main}} station buildings, known as the Rock siding, is a double-ended siding. Whilst {{this means that the}} signalmen need not communicate with one another before arranging movements into or out of this siding from either end, in practise they would liaise before conducting any unusual movement.|$|E
25|$|The section from Plimmerton to South Junction (a little {{north of}} Muri Station {{at the top}} of the Paekakariki Hill) and from North Junction (at the {{northern}} portal of northern Paekakariki tunnel) to Paekakariki was completed in 1940. The difficult single <b>track</b> <b>section</b> between South and North Junctions that passed through five short single track tunnels was left as single track. A proposal that the tunnels on the section between South and North Junctions be replaced with a single double track tunnel has been considered but has not so far been approved.|$|E

25|$|The single <b>track</b> <b>section</b> from Epping to Ongar was not {{electrified}} until 1957, {{prior to}} which the service was operated by an autotrain, carriages attached to a steam locomotive capable of being driven from either end, hired from British Railways, and an experimental AEC three-car lightweight diesel multiple unit operated part of the shuttle service Monday-Friday in June 1952. Upon electrification, 1935 Stock was used, until replaced by four-car sets of 1962 Stock specially modified {{to cope with the}} limited current. The section closed in 1994, and is now the heritage Epping Ongar Railway.|$|E
25|$|Also, the {{polarity}} of {{the power}} rails differs. On the Kleinprofil lines the power rail is positively charged and the track is negative, on the Großprofil lines it is the other way around. In East Berlin the polarity of the <b>track</b> <b>section</b> Thälmannplatz/Otto-Grotewohl-Straße - Pankow, {{was the same as}} on the Großprofil lines. After reunification, this exception to the normal Kleinprofil polarity was reversed by the BVG, even though there are benefits to this arrangement (there is less corrosion of metal parts in the tunnel with the Großprofil polarity).|$|E
25|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred after}} the Metrolink passenger train engineer, 46-year-old Robert M. Sanchez, failed to obey a red stop signal that indicated {{it was not}} safe to proceed into the single <b>track</b> <b>section.</b> The train dispatcher's computer at a remote control center in Pomona did not display a warning prior to the accident according to the NTSB. Metrolink initially reported that the dispatcher {{tried in vain to}} contact the train crew to warn them; but the NTSB contradicted this report, saying the dispatcher noticed a problem only after the accident, and was notified by the passenger train's conductor first.|$|E

25|$|The line's railway {{signaling}} {{system is designed}} to ensure that trains wait on the double <b>track</b> <b>section</b> while a train is proceeding {{in the other direction}} on the single track. The signal system was upgraded in the 1990s to support Metrolink commuter rail services, and Richard Stanger, the executive director of Metrolink in its early years of 1991 to 1998, said the system had functioned without trouble in the past. The Metrolink train would normally wait in the Chatsworth station for the daily Union Pacific freight train to pass before proceeding, unless the freight train was already waiting for it at Chatsworth. The location was not protected by catch points.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, the Adelaide Express {{was renamed}} The Overland in 1926, despite some {{reluctance}} from the South Australian authorities who jointly ran the inter-capital service. Clapp oversaw {{the reduction in}} running time for the service from sixteen {{and a half hours}} in 1928 to around fourteen hours in 1938 (with the departure time changed from 4:30pm to a much more convenient 7:00pm), achieved at very moderate cost simply through the introduction of Automatic Staff Exchange equipment between Ballarat and Serviceton to allow unimpeded progress from one <b>track</b> <b>section</b> to the next, and design improvements to the existing A2 class locomotive fleet to increase power and efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Route: Services {{operated}} from Circular Quay initially via Elizabeth, Chalmers and Redfern Streets (from 1902), then in 1933 via Pitt and Castlereagh Streets, and Eddy Avenue, Lee and Regent Streets, to Botany Street in Waterloo. A single-track connection along Bourke and O'Dea Streets {{joined at}} the present day Green Square, allowing access to the Dowling Street Tram Depot. The line then passed down {{the entire length of}} Botany Road to Botany. In Mascot, a branch led to the former Ascot Racecourse at the site of Sydney Airport. Points were provided at Bay Street on Botany Road in Botany for short working. The line was double track throughout. From Botany, a single-track line crossed the Botany Goods railway at Beauchamp Road, then passed along Perry Street and Bunnerong Road, past the former Bunnerong Power Station to join the La Perouse line at Yarra Junction. Generally a shuttle service operated on this single <b>track</b> <b>section</b> between Botany and La Perouse. This single-track line was cut back to Military Road in 1935. The line opened in 1882 as a steam tramway to Botany, and electric services commenced in 1903. The line from the junctions at Cleveland Street to Botany closed in approximately 1956/57. Sydney Buses' route 309 generally follows the route.|$|E

All but [...] of track is ballastless, combining slab track of Japanese manufacture on open line sections with switches from a German supplier. Track laying began in July 2003. The line was electrified with the 25 kV/60 Hz AC system. The signalling and train control system was laid out for bi-directional operation according to European specifications. Each <b>track</b> <b>section</b> has a checkpoint, and an automatic control system ensures that trains are spaced at least [...] apart to prevent collisions.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{departing from}} the station, the train made a slight right turn {{leading into the}} {{transfer}} <b>track</b> <b>section</b> before beginning to climb the [...] lift hill. Once {{at the top and}} after going through a pre-drop, the train made a sharp [...] right-hand drop back to the ground. Then, the train goes through a 270 degree right overbanked turn before entering a Zero-gravity roll which was the first of three former near-miss points with the Chinese Fireball train. Then, the train made a slight right turn heading straight into a wall before entering a Cobra roll. After a straight section of track, the train enters the second former near-miss point with the other train, a vertical loop. The train then made a right turn into the final former near-miss point, a corkscrew. Next, the train made a right turn followed by a left turn leading into the final brake run. Following a right turn, the train returns to the station where the riders unload and the next riders load.|$|E

Once {{at the top and}} after going through a pre-drop, the train made a sharp [...] left-hand drop back to the ground. Then, the train goes back up, through an Immelmann followed by a slight downward right turn before entering an air-time hill (this was the first of three near-miss points with the Hungarian Horntail train when the roller coasters duelled). Next, the train dropped back down turning left slightly leading into a second Immelmann. After a downward right helix and a short section of straight track, the train goes through the second former near-miss point with the other train, a vertical loop. After the loop and another section of straight track, the train made a right turn leading into the third and final former near-miss element which was a corkscrew. Then, the train made a left turn followed by a small drop leading into another section of straight track before entering the final element in the coaster layout, another corkscrew. The train then made a left turn into the final brake run. Following a left turn, the train returned to the station where riders unloaded and the next riders load.|$|E
50|$|Around {{this time}} (mid-80's) Arrow partnered with Vekoma, a Dutch {{manufacturer}} of farming and mining equipment, {{in an effort}} to have a dealer in the European market. Initially, Arrow built ride vehicles and the more complex <b>track</b> <b>sections</b> in Utah and shipped them to Holland. Over a period of several months Arrow taught Vekoma to build all types of <b>track</b> <b>sections</b> for their European customers. Vekoma then began competing directly with Arrow in the United States with the installation of Flashback at Six Flags New England in 1985.|$|R
5000|$|As {{on route}} 1, the single <b>track</b> <b>sections</b> can play havoc with reliability. Beckenham Road and Birkbeck stops are {{actually}} on the single <b>track</b> <b>sections,</b> thus unusually having only one platform (Birkbeck being opposite the single platform on the heavy rail line). An anomaly is that trams on the 2 are timed to leave Beckenham Road stop at the same times in opposite directions — which is clearly not possible. In practice trams are rarely exactly on time anyway though, {{so this is not}} too much of a problem.|$|R
50|$|For trams, {{emergency}} brakes {{are also}} necessary. In tunnels and <b>track</b> <b>sections</b> without safety area, using them outside a station may stop the tram {{at the next}} platform instead of immediately.|$|R
