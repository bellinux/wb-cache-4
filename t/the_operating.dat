40|$|The {{effect of}} tubal surgery upon early {{embryonic}} {{development in the}} rabbit oviduct was studied. Resection-reanastomosis was performed applying microsurgical techniques. Embryonic cleavage stages were recorded in the surgically altered oviduct, in the contralateral nonoperated tube, and in the tubes of nonoperated control animals. Higher cleavage rates were found in <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> animals compared with nonoperated controls. Early embryonic development was enhanced in both <b>the</b> <b>operated</b> tube and <b>the</b> contralateral nonoperated tube.
