5|$|Admission to {{the post}} {{graduate}} programs and fellowship program is done through the Common Admission Test (CAT), which is jointly conducted by the IIMs {{in the month of}} November every year. Applications are shortlisted based on CAT scores, scholastic achievement and work experience. The weightage given for each of these components varies each year. <b>The</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>are</b> called for group discussions and personal interviews, conducted in cities in India in the months of February and March. The final selection is based upon the performance in CAT, scholastic achievement, work experience, performance in group discussion, and personal interview. Admissions to the IPMX program are done based on GMAT score, work profile and personal interview. Admission to the PGPM-WE(WMP) program are done based on GMAT score or a competitive written examination conducted by IIM Lucknow. The short listed candidates based on GMAT or the written examination go through Writing Ability Test and Personal Interview (WAT & PI) to get final selection.|$|E
5|$|The {{task of the}} order's {{advisory}} council is to evaluate the nominations of potential inductees, decide if <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>are</b> worthy enough to be accepted into the order, and make recommendations to the governor general, who appoints the new members. The council is chaired by the Chief Justice of Canada, and includes the Clerk of the Queen's Privy Council, the Deputy Minister of Canadian Heritage, the Chair of the Canada Council for the Arts, the President of the Royal Society of Canada, the Chair of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, and {{five members of the}} order who sit on the council for a three-year period. If a nomination involves a non-Canadian citizen, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs is invited by the Advisory Council to offer evaluation. Decisions of the council and new appointments to and dismissals from the Order of Canada are announced through the Canada Gazette.|$|E
5|$|While the Commission is the {{executive}} branch, <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>are</b> chosen individually by the 28 national governments, which means {{it is not possible}} for a Commission Member or its President to be removed by a direct election. Rather, the legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body, which, in turn, raises the concern of the relatively low turnout (less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, {{the fact that there are}} no elections for the position of Commission President calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some. The fact that the Commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed 'comitology committees') on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.|$|E

25|$|The Constitutional Council {{published}} the official candidate list on 20 March 2007. <b>The</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>are</b> listed in a randomised order. This order {{will be used}} for the official campaign: thus, posters for Olivier Besancenot will always be on the #1 board, those for Marie-George Buffet on the #2 board, etc., regardless of where in France the boards are located.|$|E
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> not {{successful}} {{in meeting the}} first twelve requirements {{by the time the}} unit leaves camp on Saturday morning, the candidacy <b>is</b> terminated and <b>the</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>is</b> not invited to the Firecrafter Ritual.

25|$|All these councilors {{are elected}} by their schools. The {{elections}} to the Young Essex Assembly {{occur in the}} respective schools in which <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>are</b> standing, likewise for the youth councils at a district and unitary level. These young people will {{then go on to}} represent their school and their parish/ward or (in the case of the Young Essex Assembly) their entire district.|$|E
25|$|If all <b>the</b> <b>{{candidates}}</b> <b>are</b> {{from the}} same group of candidates nominated in a GRC, the Returning Officer overseeing the election in the relevant electoral division will inform the group of the number of candidates in the group to be declared elected as NCMPs. The members of the group must determine among themselves who shall be elected and inform the Returning Officer within seven days.|$|E
25|$|The trial {{features}} {{both physical}} fitness and psychological tests. Its physical fitness test includes arm flexions on a bar, vertical jump, an obstacle course, running three kilometers in eleven minutes and a half, fifty meters of freestyle swimming, a strength test, a speed race and a last challenge which tests the candidates' decision-taking capacity. On the psychological and intelligence test the mental capabilities of <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>are</b> checked.|$|E
5000|$|The DPP primary {{is carried}} out in the form of opinion polls. Opinion polls are of the [...] "comparative" [...] form, where polled persons would be asked who would they support if <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>were</b> Ma and Tsai; if <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>were</b> Ma and Su; or if <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>were</b> Ma and Hsu. The polling was {{performed}} by five companies each calling 3000 people. The population consists of 4.27 million telephone numbers that are at least one year old. The chance of getting polled is around one in three hundred.|$|R

25|$|The IITs {{also offer}} the Doctor of Philosophy degree (PhD) {{as part of}} their {{doctoral}} education programme. In it, <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>are</b> given a topic of academic interest by the professor or have to work on a consultancy project given by the industries. The duration of the program is usually unspecified and depends on the specific discipline. PhD candidates have to submit a dissertation as well as provide an oral defence for their thesis. Teaching Assistantships (TA) and Research Assistantships (RA) are often provided.|$|E
25|$|Filming {{for many}} of the tasks involve {{locations}} within London and across the UK in various cities and towns, and {{on a number of occasions}} when tasks take the teams abroad, across Europe, Northern Africa, the Middle East, and the United States. As each series sees the candidates provided with accommodation within an upmarket area of London, every episode's opening and ending scene is filmed at this location and involves a mixture of exterior and interior shots of scenes; filming is also done on site if <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>are</b> conducting work on a task within the building.|$|E
25|$|SOA administers exam MLC, {{which covers}} life {{contingencies}} topics. Starting in May 2014, MLC includes both multiple choice and open-response questions. SOA made this change because, in their view, strict multiple-choice questions {{are not sufficient}} or adequate to test whether <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>are</b> familiar and fluent in the material. The test is four-hours long, allows calculators, and is administered via a paper-and-pencil format. Multiple choice questions account for 40% of the exam, and open-response questions account for 60% of the exam. Candidates may freely move between the two sections. The two sections are graded separately. However, since the multiple-choice questions are easier, only candidates who have answered {{a certain percentage of}} the multiple-choice questions correctly have their written answers graded.|$|E

25|$|The {{examination}} is of 3 hours duration, {{and contains}} {{a total of}} 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. From 2014 onward, the examination for all the papers is carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>are</b> shown the questions in a random sequence on a computer screen. The questions consist of both multiple choice questions (four answer options out of which the correct {{one has to be}} chosen) and numerical answer type questions (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and computer mouse). Candidates are provided with scribble pads for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer automatically closes the screen from further actions.|$|E
25|$|The debates {{lasted about}} 90 minutes each, {{did not include}} commercials, and had a preset time for each answer and each reply, and the {{obligation}} to film only the speaking person at any given time. The candidates were also forbidden to bring any kind of notes with them, even though they could write some down during the debate, and no audience was allowed to participate. This set of rules was very unusual in Italian political talk shows, where politicians usually interrupt each other, talk simultaneously and {{for as long as}} they can hold the word. Questions to candidates are posted by two journalists from the Italian press: the moderator himself was not allowed to ask any questions, but only to present the debate and guarantee respect of the rules. At the end of the debates, <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>are</b> allowed to make a final statement of 3 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the process, <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>are</b> given around 10 business-themed tasks (11 for {{the seventh}} and eighth series), which are {{designed}} to test their skills in notable areas - salesmanship, negotiation, requisitioning, leadership, teamwork, and organisation - with each episode covering a single task. Both teams are briefed by Lord Sugar over what the task involves, which also includes the rules they must adhere to (i.e. what they are restricted from doing or using in the task), and the condition for winning the task, with the most common being making the most profit, achieving high sales figures, or {{coming up with a}} concept that Lord Sugar feels is the best (such as branding). Both teams often appoint someone in their team as the project manager (PM), who acts as the team's leader and deals with important key decisions, with the choice usually derived from either a candidate's background, or the amount of confidence the team has in their choice, although Sugar himself can either suggest who the team should pick as their PM, or nominate a candidate into the role, based upon his opinion of their performance in the process, their background, or, since the seventh series, from what he has seen of their business plan. As candidate numbers are whittled down during the process, the team are periodically rearranged, primarily in the task's briefing, either to balance out the number, ensure a fair distribution of skills for a specific task, or to give less vocal candidates a chance to demonstrate their abilities.|$|E

500|$|After {{being elected}} or nominated, {{candidates}} may {{participate in a}} call-out ceremony to recognize those Scouts and Scouters that were selected before they attend their Ordeal. The call-out ceremony may be performed at summer camp, a camporee, a call-out weekend or at a unit meeting. Candidates subsequently participate in an Ordeal, intended to emphasize service and selflessness. During the induction, [...] "candidates maintain complete silence, receive small amounts of food, work on camp improvement projects, and are required to sleep alone, apart from other campers, which teaches significant values." [...] If they succeed in their ordeal <b>the</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>are</b> then welcomed as Ordeal members in a formal Ordeal Ceremony.|$|E
