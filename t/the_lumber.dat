We also examined the moisture content distribution in <b>the</b> <b>lumbers.</b> <b>The</b> results were as follows: (1) Three months 2 ̆ 7 natural drying of lumbers with red heart satisfied the JAS standard of D 20, and the moisture distribution in <b>the</b> <b>lumbers</b> was relatively small.

Homer and Isabel married the following year, and Homer built a home in Hailey. Isabel was unhappy in Hailey and took Ezra with her to New York in 1887, when he was 18 months old. Homer followed them, and in 1889 he found {{a job as an}} assayer at the Philadelphia Mint. The family moved to Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, and in 1893 bought a six-bedroom house in Wyncote.|$|E

Today, the city remains an important distribution hub for companies such as Nestlé Purina PetCare, and is home to Lowell Observatory, The U.S. Naval Observatory, the United States Geological Survey Flagstaff Station, and Northern Arizona University. Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to Grand Canyon National Park, Oak Creek Canyon, the Arizona Snowbowl, Meteor Crater, and historic Route 66. The city is also a center for medical device manufacturing, since Flagstaff is home to W. L. Gore and Associates.|$|E
5|$|Like all creeks in Lycoming County, Larrys Creek {{served as}} an area for {{settlers}} to establish homesteads and farms. As logging became a major industry in the mid-19th century, the creek {{was a source of}} power for sawmills and other mills. The first sawmill on the creek, in what is now Mifflin Township, was built in 1799. The relatively low flow of water in the creek did not allow rafts of logs to be floated downstream to the river and <b>the</b> <b>lumber</b> boom at Williamsport (as they were on Pine Creek to the west).|$|E
5|$|Logging resumed in 1912 in {{the north}} part of the canyon, where The Boone's Ferry Wood and Tie Company had a site near what became Alfred Street. A sawmill and steam donkey engine {{operated}} near the future sites of Beaver Bridge and Obie's Bridge. <b>The</b> <b>lumber</b> was used chiefly for railroad ties, cordwood and flagpoles, and left huge cedar stumps that remain in the park. Intermittent logging continued through 1961, and a 1962 windstorm known as the Columbus Day Storm blew down many remaining trees.|$|E

5|$|Several mills {{powered by}} Kettle Creek {{had been built}} by 1852. Logging, {{including}} cutting down hemlock trees, was historically done in the upper Kettle Creek watershed.

With the arrival of railroads in the area in the late 1800s, the industry became more prevalent. <b>The</b> Lackawanna <b>Lumber</b> Company began working in the area in 1893. By 1900, there were two railroads along the creek used for hauling logs to a sawmill near Cross Fork. However, <b>the</b> <b>lumbering</b> industry collapsed after 1910. The population had peaked around 1900 and numerous residents of the watershed left shortly after the collapse of <b>the</b> area's <b>lumbering</b> industry. Timber production was done to a limited extent {{in the northern part of}} the watershed, as of 2001. The population has remained relatively stable since the 1930s.|$|R

During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Marysville was not adversely impacted unlike other cities in the county and country because of its diverse industries, including sawmills, grain mills, a tannery, a fertilizer plant, and a berry packing plant. The city's largest employer in the early 1950s, the Weiser Lumber Company, was destroyed in a fire on May 6, 1955, causing $300,000 in damage. <b>The</b> <b>lumber</b> mill at the site was later acquired by Welco Lumber, who closed the plant in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Ownership of {{the timber}} land {{around the tree}} was {{eventually}} acquired by the Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust, which leased the timbering rights to the North East Lumber Company.

The company found the Mingo Oak too large to cut down, and assessed that its removal was too costly to undertake.
