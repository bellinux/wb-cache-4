5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Modern</b> <b>Age</b> and Renaissance, European herbals diversified and innovated, {{and came}} to rely more on direct {{observation}} than being mere adaptations of traditional models. Typical examples from the period are the fully illustrated De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes by Leonhart Fuchs (1542, with over 400 plants), the astrologically themed Complete Herbal by Nicholas Culpeper (1653), and the Curious Herbal by Elizabeth Blackwell (1737).|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church was the {{dominant}} influence on Western civilisation from Late Antiquity to {{the dawn of}} <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>age.</b> It was the primary sponsor of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Mannerist and Baroque styles in art, architecture and music. Renaissance figures such as Raphael, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli, Fra Angelico, Tintoretto, Titian, Bernini and Caravaggio are examples of the numerous visual artists sponsored by the Church.|$|E
5|$|There is {{debate about}} the extent to which the Renaissance {{improved}} on the culture of the Middle Ages. Both Michelet and Burckhardt were keen to describe the progress made in the Renaissance towards <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>age.</b> Burckhardt likened the change to a veil being removed from man's eyes, allowing him to see clearly.|$|E

5|$|Early monasteries {{throughout}} Europe helped preserve Greek and Roman classical civilisation. The Church {{eventually became}} the dominant influence in Western civilisation into <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>age.</b> Many Renaissance figures were {{sponsored by the}} church. The 16th century, however, began to see challenges to the Church, in particular to its religious authority, by figures in the Protestant Reformation, {{as well as in}} the 17th century by secular intellectuals in the Enlightenment. Concurrently, Spanish and Portuguese explorers and missionaries spread the Church's influence through Africa, Asia, and the New World.|$|E
5|$|For the album, the Strokes strived {{to capture}} a simple rock sound that was not {{significantly}} enhanced in the studio. Building {{on the work of}} their 2001 extended play, <b>The</b> <b>Modern</b> <b>Age,</b> the band members molded compositions largely through live takes during the recording sessions, while songwriter Julian Casablancas continued to detail the lives and relationships of urban youth. Following the completion of Is This It, the Strokes embarked on a promotional world tour before its release. The album's cover photograph courted controversy for being too sexually explicit and was replaced for the US market. The American track listing was also amended in light of the September 11 terrorist attacks.|$|E
5|$|Guerrero Maya Jr. is {{the only}} wrestler to have two {{documented}} title reigns during the CMLL-era, as he previously held the titles with Delta. No team has held the championship more than once after it was brought back in 2000, but records indicate that team of Kung Fu and Kato Kung Lee held the championship {{on at least two}} separate occasions, possibly more. The current champions are also the shortest reigning champions of <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>age,</b> , second to only to Namajague and Okumura's reign of 245 days, but will surpass that if they remain champions until August 28, 2017. Los Bombardieros reign is the longest of <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>age,</b> 1,708 days although there were extended periods of time where the championship went undefended. Black Terry, who was 64 {{years old at the time}} of his title victory, is the oldest person to win the Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship. The Panther was seventeen or eighteen years old at the time he won the championship, making him the youngest champion of at least the CMLL-era and possibly in the history of the championship. In 2005, after both Stone brothers left CMLL to work for AAA, the championship was finally declared vacant.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} the {{invention}} of the electric telegraph in 1835 that <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>age</b> of weather forecasting began. Before that, the fastest that distant weather reports could travel was around 100 miles per day (160km/d), but was more typically 40–75 miles per day (60–120km/day) (whether by land or by sea). By the late 1840s, the telegraph allowed reports of weather conditions from a wide area to be received almost instantaneously, allowing forecasts to be made from knowledge of weather conditions further upwind.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} of this period {{that would have a}} profound impact on Kannada literature even into <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>age</b> was the birth of the Haridasa ("servants of Hari or Vishnu") movement. This devotional movement, although reminiscent in some ways of the Veerashaiva movement of the 12thcentury (which produced Vachana poetry and taught devotion to the god Shiva), was in contrast intimately devoted to the Hindu god Vishnu as the supreme God. The inspiration behind this movement was the philosophy of Madhvacharya of Udupi. Naraharitirtha (1281) is considered the first well-known haridasa and composer of Vaishnava devotional songs in Kannada. Before his induction into the Madhva order, he had served as a minister in the court of Kalinga (modern Orissa). The Vaishnava poetry however disappeared for about two centuries after Naraharitirtha's death before resurfacing as a popular form of folk literature during the rule of the Vijayanagara Empire. Only three of Naraharitirtha's compositions are available today.|$|E
5|$|Eorzea's history {{revolves}} around {{a series of}} Umbral and Astral Eras. Umbral Eras are periods of great calamity—the First Umbral Era {{marked the end of}} the age of gods. The guardian deities of Eorzea, known as the Twelve, retreated from direct involvement with mortals during this time. Umbral Eras are followed by periods of enlightenment and cultural growth called Astral Eras. The Third Astral Era was particularly noted for presiding over the Allagan Empire, an ancient civilization whose technology far exceeds the level of <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>age.</b> Each Umbral and Astral Era pair corresponds to one of the six basic elements—wind, lightning, fire, earth, ice, and water. The Sixth Umbral Era was believed to be the last and the civilized races hoped the Sixth Astral Era would last forever. However, five years {{prior to the start of}} the game, the Garlean Empire catalyzed a series of events that would lead to the Seventh Umbral Era.|$|E

5|$|The Empire Arts Center, in {{downtown}} Grand Forks, {{is home to}} several cultural events throughout the year. The Empire, a 1919 movie theater, was restored after the Flood of 1997 and now includes performance space, a large movie screen, a gallery, and space for artists. The Fire Hall Theatre, also downtown, is used by community members to put on several theater productions each year. The Summer Performing Arts Company (SPA) is a popular summer arts program for area K-12 students. SPA stages three major musicals mid-July. The Myra Museum, on Belmont Road near the Greater Grand Forks Greenway, is a small history museum with exhibits that trace local history from the Ice Age, through settlement, and into <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>age.</b> Other buildings on the Myra Museum grounds include the original 1868 Grand Forks Post Office, a 1917 one room school, and the historic Campbell House.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{was a popular}} comic book figure during the Silver Age of Comic Books, due to her appearances in the Batman television series and continued media exposure. She has achieved similar popularity in <b>the</b> <b>Modern</b> <b>Age</b> of Comic Books under the Birds of Prey publication and as a disabled icon. The character {{has been the subject}} of academic analysis concerning the roles of women, librarians and disabled people in mainstream media. The events of The Killing Joke, which led to the character's paralysis, as well as the restoration of her mobility, has also been a subject of debate among comic book writers, artists, editors and readership. Viewpoints range from sexism in comic books, to the limited visibility of disabled characters and the practicality of disabilities existing in a fictional universe where magic, technology, and medical science exceed the limitations of the real world.|$|E
5|$|Hellblazer {{was first}} {{published}} during {{the early days of}} <b>the</b> <b>Modern</b> <b>Age</b> of Comics, and so its themes were as dark, edgy, politically and morally complex as its contemporaries. The comic mixed supernatural and real life horror, akin to contemporary gothic, with noire, surrealism and occult detective fiction elements. Unlike other comic books, it is also unique as it follows real time in its span of 20 years, with its protagonist John Constantine aging in every publication. Because of this, writers of the series often places their era's culture and social commentary in their run. When Jamie Delano first wrote the series in the late 1980s and early 1990s, his issues were heavily inspired by the era such as punk rock and the British economy. Delano {{would be the first to}} put his political views in the series, an element never before seen in mainstream comics, such as his negative views of Thatcher's regime and by 2005 includes the War on Terror. This made John Constantine different from other comic book characters at that time, in that he fights the political and social injustice of Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|Love, sex {{and desire}} become {{important}} elements of the plot in Sant Singh Sekhon's Punjabi play Kalakar (1945), which places the epic drama in <b>the</b> <b>modern</b> <b>age.</b> It depicts Ahalya as a free-spirited woman, who dares to be painted nude by Inder (Indra), a pupil of the art professor, Gautama, and defends her decision against her husband's criticisms. N. S. Madhavan's Malayalam story (April 2006) also retells Ahalya's tale in a modern setting, wherein Ahalya, accused of adultery, is beaten by her husband, leaving her in a coma from which the neurologist, Rama, revives her. The 2015 film Ahalya gives a feminist twist to the tale where the policeman Indra turns into a stone doll, after visiting Ahalya. The tale was also parodied in the Telugu film Attarintiki Daredi. However, the practice of retelling the classical Ahalya–Indra tale in a contemporary setting is not new. The Yoga Vasistha (1001–1400) narrates {{a tale of two}} adulterous lovers, Queen Ahalya and the Brahmin Indra. Here, Ahalya and Indra fall in love and continue their affair, despite being punished by Ahalya's jealous husband. After death, they reunite in their next birth.|$|E
