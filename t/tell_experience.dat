40|$|The present {{research}} {{aimed to explore}} {{the ways in which}} people narrate and understand instances of deviating from master narratives [...] cultural scripts, social norms, or majority identity categories. A sample of 78 undergraduate students completed a survey, which included a narrative of a master narrative deviation, a narrative of an <b>experience</b> <b>telling</b> that deviation, a number of questions related to those narratives and several other measures including ego development and well-being. Narratives were coded for a variety of characteristics. As hypothesized, feeling silenced and the positivity of a <b>telling</b> <b>experience</b> were associated with several qualities of the narratives. Ego development moderated the relationships between feeling silenced and both presence of master narrative and positive meaning making. The relationships between positivity of the <b>telling</b> <b>experience</b> and both development of counter narrative and presence of vulnerability were also moderated by ego development. Future research can continue to investigate the ways in which silencing and <b>telling</b> <b>experiences</b> effect the construction of narratives and meaning made from experiences. The importance of master narrative deviation experiences to narrative identity can also be expanded upon in future research...|$|R

40|$|Building on {{research}} examining {{the role of}} cultural and social forces in shaping narrative, {{this study examined the}} content of master narrative deviations, as well as the interrelationship between such deviations, <b>experiences</b> of <b>telling</b> others about them, and personality characteristics. Seventy-eight participants provided narratives of master narrative deviations and of telling such deviations. They also completed Loevinger’s ego development task and several measures of well-being. The results suggest that feelings of deviating from master narratives occur in a wider variety of domains than previous studies have suggested. They also suggest that feeling silenced may spur processes of ego development. Further, ego level may be important in determining the effects of <b>telling</b> <b>experiences</b> on narrative identity. For example, a positive <b>telling</b> <b>experience</b> seems to promote counter narrative development in individuals with low ego levels; the same effect is not present in individuals with higher ego levels. Findings are discussed in light of the need for more research on how individual differences affect identity processes...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{individual}} differences in processing and narrating master narrative deviations (MNDs), or having diverged in some way from that which is considered normal, expected, or accepted by society. Participants provided a written narrative of an MND experience, as well as answering questions about their feelings surrounding their MND and their <b>experiences</b> <b>telling</b> their story of MND to others. Participants also completed measures of ego development and well-being. Results demonstrated various associations of feelings of being silenced and <b>telling</b> <b>experience</b> positivity with MND narrative qualities, and between these variables and well-being as an outcome. Ego development moderated some of those relationships. Exploratory analyses also revealed differences in experiences and expressions of MND across varying types of MND. This study provides insight into personality-related and social factors that influence how people process and narrate MND experiences, which {{are considered to be}} universal to some extent, as well as how interactions among these variables relate to well-being as an outcome...|$|R
