The multiaxial response of metal matrix composites, depicted in terms of macro flow/damage surfaces, is predicted at room and elevated temperatures using an analytical micromechanical model that includes viscoplastic matrix response as well as fiber-matrix debonding. Macro flow/damage surfaces (i. e., debonding envelopes, matrix threshold surfaces, macro 'yield' surfaces, surfaces of constant inelastic strain rate, and surfaces of constant dissipation rate) are determined for silicon carbide/titanium in three stress spaces. Residual stresses are shown <b>to</b> <b>offset</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> of <b>the</b> flow/damage surfaces from the origin and their shape is significantly altered by debonding. The results indicate which type of flow/damage surfaces should be characterized and what loadings applied to provide the most meaningful experimental data for guiding theoretical model development and verification...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a solar sail {{attitude}} controller which uses ballast masses moving inside the sail booms as actuators and to demonstrate its ability of performing time efficient reorientation maneuvers. The proposed controller consists of a combination of a feedforward and a feedback controller, which takes advantage of the feedforward system’s fast response and the feedback’s ability of responding to unpredicted disturbances. The feedforward controller considers the attitude dynamics of the sailcraft and the disturbance torque due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of pressure <b>offset</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of mass. Additional disturbance torques, like those from the environment or from asymmetry of the spacecraft structure, are then handled by the feedback controller.

40|$|A paper {{discusses}} {{a concept}} for controlling the attitude and thrust vector of a three-axis stabilized Solar Sail spacecraft using only four single degree-of-freedom articulated spar-tip vanes. The vanes, {{at the corners}} of the sail, would be turned to commanded angles about the diagonals of the square sail. Commands would be generated by an adaptive controller that would track a given trajectory while rejecting effects of such disturbance torques as those attributable <b>to</b> <b>offsets</b> between <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of pressure on the sail and <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of mass. <b>The</b> controller would include a standard proportional + derivative part, a feedforward part, and a dynamic component that would act like a generalized integrator. The controller would globally track reference signals, and in the presence of such control-actuator constraints as saturation and delay, the controller would utilize strategies to cancel or reduce their effects. The control scheme would be embodied in a robust, nonlinear algorithm that would allocate torques among the vanes, always finding a stable solution arbitrarily close to the global optimum solution of the control effort allocation problem. The solution would include an acceptably small angle, slow limit-cycle oscillation of the vanes, while providing overall thrust vector pointing stability and performance...|$|R
5000|$|Any pair of circles has two {{centers of}} similarity, therefore, three circles would have six centers of similarity, two for each {{distinct}} pair of given circles. Remarkably, these six points lie on four lines, three points on each line. Here {{is one way}} to show this.Consider the plane of the three circles (Figure 9). Offset each center point perpendicularly to the plane by a distance equal to the corresponding radius. <b>The</b> <b>centers</b> can be <b>offset</b> <b>to</b> either side of the plane. <b>The</b> three <b>offset</b> points define a single plane. In that plane we build three lines through each pair of points. The lines pierce the plane of circles in the points HAB, HBC and HAC. Since the locus of points which are common to two distinct and non-parallel planes is a line then necessarily these three points lie on such line. From the similarity of triangles HABAA&prime; and HABBB&prime; we see that [...] (rA,B being the radii of the circles) and thus HAB is in fact <b>the</b> homothetic <b>center</b> of <b>the</b> corresponding two circles. We can do the same for HBC and HAC.Repeating the above procedure for different combinations of homothetic centers (in our method this is determined by the side <b>to</b> which we <b>offset</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> of <b>the</b> circles) would yield a total of four lines — three homothetic centers on each line (Figure 10).|$|R
40|$|In structure-from-motion with {{a single}} camera {{it is well known}} that the scene can be only {{recovered}} up to a scale. In order to compute the absolute scale, one needs to know the baseline of the camera motion or the dimension of at least one element in the scene. In this paper, we show that there exists a class of structure-from-motion problems where it is possible to compute the absolute scale completely automati-cally without using this knowledge, that is, when the camera is mounted on wheeled vehicles (e. g. cars, bikes, or mobile robots). The construction of these vehicles puts interest-ing constraints on the camera motion, which are known as “nonholonomic constraints ” The interesting case is when the camera has an <b>offset</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vehicle’s <b>center</b> of motion. We show that by just knowing this <b>offset,</b> <b>the</b> absolute scale can be computed with a good accuracy when the vehicle moves. We give a mathematical derivation and provide ex-perimental results on both simulated and real data. To our knowledge this is the first time nonholonomic constraints of wheeled vehicles are used to estimate the absolute scale. We believe that the proposed method can be useful in those research areas involving visual odometry and mapping with vehicle mounted cameras. 1...|$|R
40|$|In principle, {{the most}} {{straightforward}} {{method of estimating}} the Hubble constant relies on time delays between mirage images of strongly-lensed sources. It is a puzzle, then, that the values of H 0 obtained with this method span a range from 50 - 100 km/s/Mpc. Quasars monitored to measure these time delays, are multi-component objects. The variability may arise from different components of the quasar or may even originate from a jet. Misidentifying a variable emitting region in a jet with emission from the core region may introduce an error in the Hubble constant derived from a time delay. Here, we investigate the complex structure of sources as the underlying physical explanation of the widespread in values of the Hubble constant based on gravitational lensing. Our Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the derived value of the Hubble constant is very sensitive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>offset</b> between <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of <b>the</b> emission and <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of <b>the</b> variable emitting region. Thus, we propose using the value of H 0 known from other techniques to spatially resolve {{the origin of the}} variable emission once the time delay is measured. We advocate this method particularly for gamma-ray astronomy, where the angular resolution of detectors reaches approximately 0. 1 degree; lensed blazars offer the only route for identify the origin of gamma-ray flares. Large future samples of gravitationally lensed sources identified with Euclid, SKA, and LSST will enable a statistical determination of H 0. Comment: Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
40|$|Spitzer {{images of}} Tycho's {{supernova}} remnant in the mid-infrared reveal limb-brightened emission {{from the entire}} periphery of the shell and faint filamentary structures in the interior. As with other young remnants, this emission is produced by dust grains, warmed to ∼ 100 K in the post-shock environment by collisions with energetic electrons and ions. The ratio of the 70 to 24 μm fluxes is a diagnostic of the dust temperature, {{which in turn is}} a sensitive function of the plasma density. We find significant variations in the 70 / 24 flux ratio around the periphery of Tycho's forward shock, implying order-of-magnitude variations in density. While some of these are likely localized interactions with dense clumps of the interstellar medium, we find an overall gradient in the ambient density surrounding Tycho, with densities 3 - 10 times higher in the NE than in the SW. This large density gradient is qualitatively consistent with the variations in the proper motion of the shock observed in radio and X-ray studies. Overall, the mean ISM density around Tycho is quite low (∼ 0. 1 - 0. 2 cm^- 3), consistent with the lack of thermal X-ray emission observed at the forward shock. We perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a Type Ia SN expanding into a density gradient in the ISM, and find that the overall round shape of the remnant is still easily acheivable, even for explosions into significant gradients. However, this leads <b>to</b> an <b>offset</b> of <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of <b>the</b> explosion from <b>the</b> geometric <b>center</b> of <b>the</b> remnant of up to 20...|$|R
40|$|I {{summarize}} {{the theory of}} acceleration of non-neutral particle beams by starvation electric fields along the polar magnetic field lines of rotation powered pulsars, including the effect of dragging of inertial frames which dominates the acceleration of a space charge limited beam. I apply these acceleration results to a new calculation of the radio pulsar death line, under the hypotheses that pulsar "death" corresponds to cessation of pair creation over the magnetic poles and that the magnetic field has a locally dipolar topology. While the frame dragging effect in star centered dipole geometry does improve comparison of the theory with observation, an unacceptably large fraction of the observed stars outside the bounds of pair creation theory still persists. <b>Offsetting</b> <b>the</b> dipole improves the correspondence between theory and observation. The result is a "death valley" for pulsars; acceptable comparison of observation and theory occurs if the boundary of death valley corresponds <b>to</b> <b>offsets</b> of <b>the</b> dipole <b>center</b> from <b>the</b> stellar <b>center</b> ∼ (0. 7 - 0. 8) R_*. I {{also point out that}} pulsars are absent for magnetic moments corresponding to star centered polar fields in excess of ∼ 4 × 10 ^ 13 Gauss, and I suggest that this absence is due to pairs forming as bound positronium atoms in such strong fields, creating a neutral, relativistically outflowing gas which cannot participate in low altitude collective radio emission processes in such strongly magnetized objects.
