5|$|In {{response}} to {{the bombing of the}} Syrian government's Shayrat Airbase in 2017, The Daily Stormer was one of several alt-right outlets that criticized Trump. While Anglin alleged <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>could</b> be under control of a purportedly Jewish deep state, weev said in a video on the website that he retained faith in Trump from his past actions.|$|E
5|$|The administration's {{response}} to racial violence was minimal, {{causing him to}} lose black support. When black postmasters at Hogansville, Georgia in 1897, and at Lake City, South Carolina the following year, were assaulted, McKinley issued no statement of condemnation. Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction, supporters responded by saying there was little <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>could</b> do to intervene. Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events, as Harrison had done.|$|E
5|$|The {{term for}} the {{president}} is five years, but due to a 1996 referendum, the election {{that was supposed to}} occur in 1999 was pushed back to 2001. Under the 1994 constitution, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>could</b> only serve for two terms as president, but due to a change in the constitution, term limits were eliminated. During the course of the office, elections were held in 1994, 2001, 2006, 2010 and on 11 October 2015. Alexander Lukashenko has been the only person who has served as president since the elections in 1994.|$|E

25|$|When President Dwight D.

5|$|In the Senate, Stevenson was a {{conservative}} stalwart, steadfastly opposing spending on internal improvements {{and maintaining a}} strict constructionist view of the constitution. He urged his fellow senators to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1871, claiming that its provision that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>could</b> suspend the right of habeas corpus in cases where he believed violence was imminent amounted to giving the chief executive the powers of a dictator. He also opposed the appropriation of federal money to fund the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{because he did not}} believe Congress was given the authority to make such an allocation under the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|After Lukashenko {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} in 1994, he stated his intention to amend the recently passed Constitution. The amendments, according to Lukashenko, would expand {{the power of his}} office, marking a turning point in post-Soviet era politics in Belarus. A May 1995 national referendum was {{the first step in the}} amendment process. Out of the four questions, one asked if <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>could</b> disband parliament if the members violate national law. The vote, which several Supreme Soviet deputies protested, resulted in 77% in favor of the provision regarding the dismissal of the legislature by the president. Other questions on the ballot, such as the national flag and national emblem, didn't affect the Constitution as a whole, but their status has been decided by the Constitution. Two years later, Lukashenko scheduled the first referendum that would potentially alter the Constitution. The last referendum on the Constitution occurred in 2004, also scheduled by Lukashenko.|$|E

25|$|The President of the United States {{appointed}} territorial governors to four-year terms. Despite a set term, {{the governor}} {{served at the}} pleasure of the U.S. president, meaning that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>could</b> replace him before his term was up.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, when a {{committee}} of military law experts at the Palm Center, an anti-DADT research institute, concluded that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>could</b> issue an Executive Order to suspend homosexual conduct discharges, Obama rejected that option and said he wanted Congress to change the law.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the powers}} of <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of Latvia are limited and the office is rather symbolic, 6th {{president}} Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga, who held office from 1999 to 2007, managed to gain political authority and high popular approval. By Latvian law one cannot be president for more than eight years. Therefore, <b>the</b> previous <b>president</b> <b>could</b> not be re-elected and the election drew significant public attention.|$|R
50|$|The {{position}} of collector {{was appointed by}} <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> subject to confirmation by the Senate.

25|$|Soon {{after the}} crash, Artur Górski, a Polish MP from the Law and Justice party, {{claimed that the}} Smolensk air traffic {{controllers}} were ordered to prevent the plane from landing, so that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>could</b> not attend the Katyń ceremony, resulting in the crash.

25|$|As Herrera {{lay in the}} Army {{hospital}} {{recovering from}} his wounds, President Truman was not sure the young man would be well enough for a formal presentation of the Medal of Honor.

25|$|In 1979, when President Carter {{normalized}} {{relations with}} Communist China, Goldwater {{and some other}} senators sued him in the Supreme Court, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>could</b> not terminate the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with Republic of China (Taiwan) without the approval of Congress. The case, Goldwater v. Carter 444 U.S. 996, was dismissed by the court as a political question.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> primary working <b>Presidents</b> {{residence}} is <b>the</b> Senate building (also {{known as}} 1st building) in the Moscow Kremlin complex.

25|$|In the past, {{elections}} {{were held in}} November and <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> inauguration was held on December 30 (Rizal Day). This ensured that when the inauguration was usually held at Quirino Grandstand, <b>the</b> new <b>President</b> <b>could</b> see <b>the</b> Rizal Monument {{on the anniversary of}} his death. Ferdinand Marcos transferred the dates of both the elections and the inauguration to May and June, respectively, and it remains so to this day.|$|R
25|$|After Lincoln {{issued the}} Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, the federal {{administration}} adopted {{a policy of}} organizing United States Colored Troops.

25|$|In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006), the US Supreme Court {{ruled that}} Common Article Three of the Geneva Conventions {{applied to all}} detainees in the War on Terror.

It said that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>could</b> not unilaterally establish such tribunals, and that Congress needed to authorize {{a means by which}} detainees could confront their accusers and challenge their detention.|$|E
25|$|On June 2, 1952, in a 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court {{declared}} in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer {{that the president}} lacked the authority to seize the steel mills. Writing for a heavily divided majority, Justice Hugo Black held {{that the president had}} no authority under the Constitution to seize private property on the grounds of national security. Since the Congress had not otherwise authorized the president to seize the steel mills, <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>could</b> not do so.|$|E
500|$|In 1906, a {{group of}} New Jersey Democrats {{promoted}} Cleveland as a possible candidate for the United States Senate. [...] The incumbent, John F.

25|$|In June 1903, Pershing {{was ordered}} {{to return to the}} United States. President Theodore Roosevelt, taken by Pershing's ability, petitioned the Army General Staff to promote Pershing to colonel. At the time, Army officer {{promotions}} were based primarily on seniority rather than merit, and although there was widespread acknowledgment that Pershing should serve as a colonel, the Army General Staff declined to change their seniority-based promotion tradition just to accommodate Pershing. They would not consider a promotion to lieutenant colonel or even major. This angered Roosevelt, but since <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>could</b> only name and promote army officers in the General ranks, his options for recognizing Pershing through promotion were limited.|$|E
25|$|In October 1935, Manuel L. Quezon {{was elected}} the first President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, {{which had been}} established, still under United States sovereignty, under a {{constitution}} ratified on 14 May of that year. During its first five years, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>could</b> serve for an unrenewable six-year term. It was later amended in 1940 to limit a President to serving {{no more than two}} four-year terms. When President Quezon exiled himself to the United States after the Philippines fell to the Empire of Japan in World War II, he appointed Chief Justice José Abad Santos as Acting President and as Acting Commander-in Chief of the Armed Forces. Abad Santos was subsequently executed by the Imperial Japanese Army on May 2, 1942.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of September 21, the Butts County Superior Court denied Davis's request to halt his execution. The Georgia Supreme Court also denied his appeal. Davis was due to be {{executed}} at 7pm EDT. The same night, Jay Carney, the White House Press Secretary, announced that President Obama would not intervene in the case (while <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>could</b> not have pardoned Davis, he did {{have the authority to}} order a federal investigation that might have led to a delay in the execution). Davis filed a request with the U.S. Supreme Court to stay his execution. Almost an hour after Davis's scheduled execution time, the Supreme Court announced they would review his petition, thereby postponing the execution. The Supreme Court, however, denied Davis's petition, after deliberating for several hours.|$|E
5000|$|The Act was {{intended}} to prevent {{the business of the}} Court of Session and High Court of Justiciary being disrupted by the absence of Scotland's two most senior judges (<b>the</b> Lord <b>President</b> and <b>the</b> Lord Justice Clerk).

50|$|In <b>the</b> past, <b>presidents</b> <b>could</b> appoint {{members of}} the United States civil service. This use of the spoils system allowed presidents to reward {{political}} supporters with jobs. Following <b>the</b> assassination of <b>President</b> James Garfield by Charles J.

The Office of Personnel Management now oversees the staffing of 2.8 million federal jobs in the federal bureaucracy.|$|R
