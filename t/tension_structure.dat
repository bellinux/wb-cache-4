The large wood-and-rope climber area was replaced with the large [...] "Soak City" [...] waterpark, the first water park in Ontario. Several small fair-ground rides were later added. The large <b>tension</b> <b>structure</b> tent that covered most of the children's park was removed in 2009/10, leaving a large open area with a new stage. Many of the concrete bollards used to secure the various tents and structures can still be seen.|$|E
5000|$|The {{preliminary}} design of <b>tension</b> <b>structures</b> involves {{the determination of}} an initial configuration referred to as form finding. In addition to satisfying the equilibrium conditions, the initial configuration must accommodate both architectural (aesthetics) and structural (strength and stability) requirements. Further, the requirements of space and clearance should be met, the membrane principal stresses must be tensile to avoid wrinkling, and the radii of the double-curved surface should be small enough to resist out-of-plane loads and to insure structural stability (work [...] ). Several variations on form finding approaches based on FEM {{have been developed to}} assist engineers in the design of <b>tension</b> fabric <b>structures.</b> All of them are based on the same assumption as that used for analysing the behaviour of <b>tension</b> <b>structures</b> under various loads. However, as it is noted by some researchers it might sometimes be preferable to use the so-called ‘minimal surfaces’ in the design of <b>tension</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Tension</b> <b>structures,</b> in {{the form}} of {{pre-stressed}} cable nets and fabric roofs, are becoming a permanent feature of modern architecture. Their popularity can be attributed to their aesthetic appeal, improved durability and the development of computational analysis techniques that facilitate the design process. Despite progress and growing interest in <b>tension</b> <b>structures,</b> their behaviour and complexities of design are not fully understood, except by a few specialists working in the field. This paper introduces the topic, outlines practical difficulties and discusses misconceptions related to the design of <b>tension</b> <b>structures.</b> The main focus of the paper is placed on a process known as form-finding-an issue that affects practically every aspect of design and construction. A way forward, suggested in the closing part of the paper, aims to provoke discussion on the role of engineering education and the division of labour between architect and engineer...|$|R
40|$|Form-finding has to {{be carried}} out for <b>tensioned</b> fabric <b>structure</b> in order to {{determine}} the initial equilibrium shape under prescribed support condition and prestress pattern. <b>Tensioned</b> fabric <b>structures</b> are normally designed to be in the form of equal tensioned surface. <b>Tensioned</b> fabric <b>structure</b> is highly suited to be used for realizing surfaces of complex or new forms. However, research study on a new form as a <b>tensioned</b> fabric <b>structure</b> has not attracted much attention. Another source of inspiration minimal surface which could be adopted as form for <b>tensioned</b> fabric <b>structure</b> is very crucial. The aim of this study is to propose initial equilibrium shape of <b>tensioned</b> fabric <b>structures</b> in the form of Chen-Gackstatter. Computational form-finding using nonlinear analysis method is used to determine the Chen-Gackstatter form of uniformly stressed surfaces. A <b>tensioned</b> fabric <b>structure</b> must curve equally in opposite directions to give the resulting surface a three dimensional stability. In an anticlastic doubly curved surface, the sum of all positive and all negative curvatures is zero. This study provides an alternative choice for structural designer to consider the Chen-Gackstatter applied in <b>tensioned</b> fabric <b>structures.</b> The results on factors affecting initial equilibrium shape can serve as a reference for proper selection of surface parameter for achieving a structurally viable surface...|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} is to develop the shapes described by these data, {{as close as possible}} to the ideal doubly curved strips. In general, cutting pattern generation involves two steps. First, the global surface of a <b>tension</b> <b>structure</b> is divided into individual cloths. The corresponding cutting pattern at the second step can be found by simply taking each cloth strip and unfolding it on a planar area. In the case of the ideal doubly curved membrane surface the subsurface cannot be simply unfolded and they must be flattened. For example, in, SGM has been used for the flattening problem solution.|$|E
5000|$|For {{structural}} analysis, {{the configuration}} of the structure is generally known à priori. This is not the case for tensile structures such as tension fabric structures. Since the membrane in a <b>tension</b> <b>structure</b> possesses no flexural stiffness, its form or configuration depends upon initial prestressing and the loads to which it is subjected. Thus, the load-bearing behaviour and the shape of the membrane cannot be separated and cannot be generally described by simple geometric models only. The membrane shape, the loads on the structure and the internal stresses interact in a non-linear manner to satisfy the equilibrium equations.|$|E
50|$|Stationary {{land based}} {{platforms}} would have simpler and less costly logistical {{access to the}} base. They also would have an advantage {{of being able to}} be at high altitude, such as on top of mountains. In an alternate concept, the base station could be a tower, forming a space elevator which comprises both a compression tower close to the surface, and a tether structure at higher altitudes. Combining a compression structure with a <b>tension</b> <b>structure</b> would reduce loads from the atmosphere at the Earth end of the tether, and reduce the distance into the Earth's gravity field the cable needs to extend, and thus reduce the critical strength-to-density requirements for the cable material, all other design factors being equal.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Tensioned</b> {{membrane}} <b>structures</b> are pre-stressed membrane {{structures that}} are appropriate {{to be used for}} long span application. <b>Tensioned</b> membrane <b>structures</b> must depend on their shape and internal pre-stress alone to achieve stability and to carry the loads. Some of the largest stadiums, airports, convention halls and commercial places are <b>tensioned</b> membrane <b>structures.</b> It is essential to perform shape-finding analysis while dealing with <b>tensioned</b> membrane <b>structures.</b> In this study, shape-finding analysis is carried out using computer program for stress analysis which is based on theory of nonlinear displacement method.

50|$|A {{stressed}} {{ribbon bridge}} (also stress-ribbon bridge or catenary bridge) is a <b>tension</b> <b>structure</b> (similar {{in many ways}} to a simple suspension bridge). The suspension cables are embedded in the deck which follows a catenary arc between supports. Unlike the simple span, the ribbon is stressed in traction, which adds to the stiffness of the structure (simple suspension spans tend to sway and bounce). The supports in turn support upward thrusting arcs that allow the grade to be changed between spans (where multiple spans are used). Such bridges are typically made from concrete reinforced by steel tensioning cables. Where such bridges carry vehicle traffic {{a certain degree of}} stiffness is required to prevent excessive flexure of the structure, obtained by stressing the concrete in compression.|$|E
5000|$|Eric Drexler {{developed}} a concept for a sail {{in which the}} polymer was removed. He proposed very high thrust-to-mass solar sails, and made prototypes of the sail material. His sail would use panels of thin aluminium film (30 to 100 nanometres thick) supported by a tensile structure. The sail would rotate {{and would have to}} be continually under thrust. He made and handled samples of the film in the laboratory, but the material was too delicate to survive folding, launch, and deployment. The design planned to rely on space-based production of the film panels, joining them to a deploy-able <b>tension</b> <b>structure.</b> Sails in this class would offer high area per unit mass and hence accelerations up to [...] "fifty times higher" [...] than designs based on deploy-able plastic films.The material developed for the Drexler solar sail was a thin aluminium film with a baseline thickness of 0.1 µm, to be fabricated by vapor deposition in a space-based system. Drexler used a similar process to prepare films on the ground. As anticipated, these films demonstrated adequate strength and robustness for handling in the laboratory and for use in space, but not for folding, launch, and deployment.|$|E

40|$|A shell-supported {{footbridge}} {{was designed}} by shaping an anticlastic membrane in compression between deck and foundations. Since it {{would be subject to}} biaxial compression, it was appropriate to be made of concrete because concrete strength could be exploited and crack propagation prevented. With reference to Musmeci's work, a form-finding algorithm shaped the shell as a <b>tension</b> <b>structure</b> with same loads, restraint reactions and internal normal forces, but with the opposite sign. Using a finite element (FE) model of the shell, unwished bending moments (and therefore tensile stresses) were, however, found, because of second order displacements and (contrary to a <b>tension</b> <b>structure)</b> because of the bending stiffness of the reinforced concrete (RC) shell. Tensile stresses were progressively eliminated by removing material from the shell regions where unwished bending moments occurred. For this purpose, topology optimization with the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method was used, and different shell structures with cavities for different values of given volume reduction were obtained. Appropriate indexes for structural response were defined, and an optimization index was finally used to identify the most suitable pattern of cavities along the shell...|$|E

40|$|When using Topological Mapping (TM) {{together}} with the Force Density Method (FDM) {{in order to find}} a first form of equilibrium for a <b>tension</b> <b>structure</b> whose fixed nodes coincide in plan view with the vertices of a regular polygon, it has been observed that the symmetry may be lost.

With a symmetric mesh, the later cutting pattern generation process becomes simpler, easier, and cheaper.

40|$|Architectural fabrics are an {{integral}} part of fabric architecture, a term used to describe tensile fabric membranes – also known as fabric structures or textile buildings. This chapter discusses architectural fabrics in the context of their physical properties, durability, aesthetics and suitability for a given application.

Images of samples of different types of architectural fabrics, their descriptions and examples of application in real projects are used to clarify the subject. There are numerous factors affecting the choice of architectural fabric and these include a manufacturing design stage, known as patterning – the creation of a tensile surface in three-dimensional space out of a series of two-dimensional, unstrained pieces of fabric.
