50|$|The {{buoyancy}} {{effects of}} water {{have a large}} impact on certain soil properties, such as the effective stress present {{at any point in}} a soil medium. Consider an arbitrary point five meters below the ground surface. In dry soil, particles at this point experience a total overhead stress equal to the depth underground (5 meters), multiplied by the specific weight of the soil. However, when the local water <b>table</b> <b>height</b> is within said five meters, the total stress felt five meters below surface is decreased by the product of the height of the water table in to the five meter area, and the specific weight of water, 9.81 kN/m^3. This parameter is called the effective stress of the soil, basically equal to the difference in a soil's total stress and pore water pressure. The pore water pressure is essential in differentiating a soil's total stress from its effective stress. A correct representation of stress in soil is necessary for accurate field calculations in a variety of engineering trades.|$|E
50|$|It can {{be argued}} that the {{depiction}} of groundwater is an even more complex task than that of surface water. The two resources are by no means disjoint, as knowing where surface water recharges groundwater and where groundwater flows supply surface water is an important aspect of the hydrologic cycle. Hydrogeology is especially well suited to GIS. Groundwater moves much more slowly than surface water, on the order of less than a meter per day up to perhaps a hundred meters per day, and is 3-dimensional in flow. In contrast, surface water flows much faster and is more two-dimensional. Groundwater flow is a function of geology and “head,” the total potential energy at a location. Groundwater flows from higher head to lower head at a travel rate and flow path dictated by geology. Head values, geology, groundwater flow direction, even water <b>table</b> <b>height</b> and location of aquifers are among the quantities which may be presented spatially in GIS and used for analysis, management of water availability and water quality, and land use practices.|$|E

50|$|The {{selection}} of the OR table depends on the primary use of the system. Interventional tables with floating table tops and tilt and cradle compete with fully integrated flexible OR tables. Identification of the right table is a compromise between interventional and surgical requirements. Surgical and interventional requirements may be mutually exclusive. Surgeons, especially orthopedic, general and neurosurgeons usually expect {{a table with a}} segmented tabletop for flexible patient positioning. For imaging purposes, a radiolucent tabletop, allowing full body coverage, is required. Therefore, non-breakable carbon fibre tabletops are used. Interventionalists require a floating tabletop to allow fast and precise movements during angiography. Cardiac and vascular surgeons, in general, have less complex positioning needs, but based on their interventional experience in angiography may be used to having fully motorized movements of the table and the tabletop. For positioning patients on non breakable tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. inflatable cushions. Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable angiography tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended. To further accommodate typical surgical needs, side rails for mounting surgical equipment like retractors or limb holders should be available for the table. The position of the table in the room also impacts surgical workflow. A diagonal position in the OR may be considered in order to gain space and flexibility in the room, as well as access to the patient from all sides. Alternatively, a conventional surgery table can be combined with an imaging system if the vendor offers a corresponding integration. The operating room can then be used either with a radiotranslucent but not breakable tabletop that supports 3D imaging, or with a universal breakable tabletop that provides enhanced patient positioning, but restricts 3D imaging. The latter are particularly suited for neuro- or orthopedic surgery, and these integrated solutions recently also became commercially available. If it is planned to share the room for hybrid and open conventional procedures, these are sometimes preferred. They provide greater workflow flexibility because the tabletops are dockable and can be easily exchanged, but require some compromises with interventional imaging. In summary, important aspects to be included considered are the position in the room, radiolucency (carbon fiber tabletop), compatibility, and integration of imaging devices with the operating table. Further aspects include table load, adjustable <b>table</b> <b>height,</b> and horizontal mobility (floating) including vertical and lateral tilt. It is important to also have proper accessories available, such as rails for mounting special surgical equipment retractors, camera holder).

40|$|Abstract: The {{advent of}} laparoscopic surgery {{has changed the}} concept of surgery from {{prolonged}} painful to painless, cosmetically satisfying and short stay. In {{the past few years}} many instruments have been developed and introduced into the operating room (OR), but there has been ongoing debate about the optical ergonomic posture of the operating surgeon. One of the main ergonomic problem in our currently available operating room table is that they are designed for the open surgery and are not ideal (suitable) for the laparoscopic surgery. Since laparoscopic surgery requires the use of longer instruments than open surgery, thus changing the relation between the height of the surgeon and the desirable height of the operating room table. This study aims to understand an ergonomically optimal operating <b>table</b> <b>height</b> required for the particular height of the surgeon from the floor so that they can perform their surgery comfortably. The operating <b>table</b> <b>height</b> was defined as the upper level of the table from the floor.

40|$|International audienceThe {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{to assess the}} local groundwater flow, the extent of seawater invasion and the controls on recharge in the aquifer {{and to try to}} understand whether the aquifer is broken into discrete compartments. The study area is located in the northwest of England and encompasses the urban area of Liverpool and surrounding countryside and extends east-west from Liverpool to Widnes and as far north as Formby. The Irish Sea marks the western margin of the area while the Mersey estuary defines the southern margin. The Triassic sandstone in this area has been, and remains, an important aquifer although industrialisation and groundwater exploitation have led to significant water quality problems. Maps of water table for the years 1993, 1997, 2000 and 2002 and schematic cross-sections of the water <b>table</b> <b>height</b> along the faults were prepared to trace any effect of these faults on water <b>table</b> <b>height</b> across. Studying the water table maps and cross sections revealed that: 1) there are substantial differences in water <b>table</b> <b>height</b> across some of the NNW-SSE trending faults implying that groundwater flow is strongly limited by fault, 2) an anticline in the east of the area acts as a groundwater divide and 3) the water table seems to follow the topography in some places, although steep changes in water table occur across faults showings that they locally control the water table elevation. The aquifer was thus provisionally subdivided into several hydrogeological sub-basins based on water <b>table</b> <b>height</b> patterns and the occurrence of major structural features (faults and a fold). Using groundwater geochemistry data, contour maps of chloride and sulphate concentration largely support the structural sub-division of the area into hydrogeological sub-basins. Scrutiny of groundwater geochemical data, averaged for each sub-basin, confirmed the degree of compartmentalisation and the occurrence of sealed faults. The variation of the geochemical composition of the groundwater not only relates to the different, localised geochemical processes and seawater intrusion but also relate to compartmentalisation due to faulting. Faults have limited the degree of mixing between the groundwater types thus retaining the specific characteristics of each sub-basin. Highly localised seawater intrusion is mainly controlled by low permeability fault close to the Irish Sea and Mersey estuary. There is no effectively no invasion of seawater beyond the faults that lie closest to the coastline. Freshwater recharge to the aquifer must be highly localised and will mainly occur by vertical percolation of rain and surface water rather than whole aquifer-scale groundwater flow...|$|E
