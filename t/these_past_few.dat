Poniewozik stated that Santana confronting her sexuality {{was one of}} the highlights of [...] "Mash Off". Wightman commented that despite Santana's callous personality, [...] "watching her burst into tears and sob that she hasn't even told her parents about her sexuality yet [...] heartbreaking". Robert Canning of IGN wrote, [...] "The biggest development was the unexpected way Santana's sexuality became public. It was a nice way to end things, building tension towards hopefully more resonating episodes to come." [...] VanDerWerff said that [...] "the last five minutes of this episode are phenomenal, one of those times that the show gets the mix of tones just right and something that's vaguely comedic gets more and more horrifying and dramatic, and then we plunge down the rabbit hole and everything goes nuts."

People can easily communicate or exchange information with friends online without any physical boundaries, and because of the convenience of the Internet, more and more Internet SNS are being launched to attract young people, and these have {{become one of the most}} popular pastimes of the current generation. Internet SNS provide instant communication and information sharing to users, and they are not only prevalent in western countries (Facebook and MySpace), but also in eastern countries (Wretch and Xiaonei). However, some potential problems are hidden behind the usage, and Internet SNS users have already found some of <b>these</b> during the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> years. In terms of cultural differences, users may have different perceptions of the online risks they perceive, such as financial and time risks. Besides, the other important factor influencing the SNS usage is the privacy issue, which has an impact on people’s subsequent trust in Internet SNS. The literature review in this research offers theories claimed by different authors, and shares their findings about this subject, and the data is collected by means of interviewing 15 participants from the UK and Taiwan. The results indicate that the usage of users is truly influenced by their level of perception of online risks, and cultural values also have a slight influence on users’ different perceptions. It is hoped that the exploration in this study will be helpful for the future design of Internet SNS...|$|R

2500|$|As one Bernini scholar has summarized, [...] "Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} result {{of all of the}} [...] studies and research of <b>these</b> <b>past</b> <b>few</b> decades has been to restore to Bernini his status as the great, principal protagonist of Baroque art, the one who was able to create undisputed masterpieces, to interpret in an original and genial fashion the new spiritual sensibilities of the age, to give the city of Rome an entirely new face, and to unify the [...] language of the times." [...] Although by the end of Bernini's life there was in motion a decided reaction against his brand of flamboyant Baroque, the fact is that sculptors and architects continued to study his works and be influenced by them for several more decades (Nicola Salvi's later Trevi Fountain [...] {{is a prime example of}} the enduring post-mortem influence of Bernini on the city's landscape). The reaction against Bernini and the too-sensual, too emotionally charged Baroque in the larger culture (especially in non-Catholic countries of Europe, and particularly in Victorian England) remained in effect until well into the twentieth century (most notable are the public disparagement of Bernini by Francesco Milizia, Joshua Reynolds, and Jacob Burkhardt. Most of the popular eighteenth- and nineteenth-century tourist's guides to Rome all but ignore ignore Bernini and his work, or treat it with disdain, as in the case of the best-selling Walks in Rome (22 editions between 1871 and 1925) by Augustus J.C.

40|$|Ischemic {{heart disease}} {{represents}} 1 in 4 of total global deaths worldwide. Myocardial intercellular cross-talk regulate simultaneously the tissue homeostasis between neighboring cardiac cells {{in response to}} acute or chronic ischemic insult. Different {{studies have suggested that}} the heterocellular communication of adult myocardium is mainly based on the release of several free soluble biofactors into the extracellular milieu and on the spreading of different ions through selective channels. In light of <b>these</b> findings, the <b>past</b> <b>few</b> decades have witnessed incessant research aimed at protecting the adult myocardium against ischemic injury, but the development of effective cardioprotection is still a desirable achievement. Nowadays, the rapidly evolving nanoscience is offering the opportunity to tailor new reliable therapeutic targets at ultrastructural level in order to prevent or attenuate the progressive myocardial trimodal response (cell death, matrix degradation and reactive cell hypertrophy) against ischemic injury occurring in infarcted heart. All cardiac cell types release nanovesicles termed “exosomes” (size 40 - 100 nm), which contain different cargo under normoxic and hypoxic microenvironment. In particular, we and other investigators have demostrated that cardiac fibroblasts and cardiac progenitor cells/stem cells interact with ischemic cardiomyocytes through the release of exosomes. Our review provides current insights into the role of nanovesicles in the modulation of injury and repair responses under ischemic microenvironment...|$|R
