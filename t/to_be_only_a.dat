5|$|German ornithologist Gustav Hartlaub {{separated}} the Madagascan {{population of the}} Mascarene martin as a full species, P.madagascariensis, but more recent authorities have considered it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> subspecies, P.b.madagascariensis.|$|E
5|$|Some Scotch bonnets have a {{completely}} smooth and glossy shell. This {{was thought to}} be a different species which was given the name cicatricosa by Gmelin in 1791. This taxon was recognized for a while, including up until 2010 as a separate species, Semicassis cicatricosa. However, in 2015 this is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> form, therefore S. cicatricosa has become another synonym of S. granulata.|$|E
5|$|The age of {{the tree}} was {{determined}} by carbon dating of genetically matched plant material collected from under the tree, as dendrochronology would cause damage. The trunk itself is estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few hundred years old, but the plant has survived for much longer due to {{a process known as}} layering (when a branch comes in contact with the ground, it sprouts a new root), or vegetative cloning (when the trunk dies but the root system is still alive, it may sprout a new trunk).|$|E

5|$|Units of the 857th Grenadier Regiment, {{part of the}} 346th Infantry Division, {{attacked}} the battalion's position at midday. It appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> probing attack, easily fought off by 'A' Company. Later {{the same day the}} Germans attacked 'A' and 'C' Companies. This time they were repelled by Vickers machine gun fire and a counter-attack by the battalion's anti-tank platoon, with a Bren machine gun group under command of the Regimental Sergeant Major.|$|E
5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that just like {{everyone}} else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears to suddenly wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E
5|$|At this point, relief {{arrived from}} an {{unexpected}} quarter—Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe. The Depression had already forced three teams to either shut down outright or suspend operations never to return. Additionally, the New York Americans had been wards {{of the league}} since 1936, and it was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> {{matter of time before}} they folded (they eventually did, in 1942). Smythe {{did not want to see}} the Canadiens fold, and suggested that the Arena Company hire the Maple Leafs' former coach, Dick Irvin. Irvin was a proven winner, having led the Maple Leafs to seven finals and one Cup in nine years. The Arena Company readily accepted Smythe's suggestion, and turned to Irvin to lead the once-proud team's revitalization.|$|E

5|$|Between 1987 and 1998, the {{development}} corporation attracted 1,000companies, generating 28,299new jobs and £1.759billion of private sector investment. The setting {{up of the}} corporation was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> temporary measure, terminating on 31March 1997, but it was extended for a further year until March 1998 when responsibility for Trafford Park's development passed to Trafford Council. The park is once again a major centre of employment in Trafford, and its regeneration {{has led to a}} high start-up rate for businesses and low rates of unemployment in the area. As of 2008, there were 1,400 companies within the park employing an estimated 35,000 people.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} week of August, US troops on these hills could see minor North Korean {{activity}} across the river, which they thought were North Koreans organizing the high ground {{on the west side of}} the Naktong against a possible American attack. There were occasional attacks on the 9th Infantry's forward positions, but to the men in the front lines this appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> standard patrol action. On August 31, the UN forces were alerted to a pending attack when much of the Korean civilian labor force fled the front lines. Intelligence officers reported an attack was coming.|$|E
5|$|The Kuiper belt {{is a great}} ring {{of debris}} similar to the {{asteroid}} belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice. It extends between 30 and 50AU from the Sun. Though it is estimated to contain anything from dozens to thousands of dwarf planets, it is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies. Many of the larger Kuiper belt objects, such as Quaoar, Varuna, and Orcus, {{may prove to be}} dwarf planets with further data. There are estimated to be over 100,000 Kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than 50km, but the total mass of the Kuiper belt is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth. Many Kuiper belt objects have multiple satellites, and most have orbits that take them outside the plane of the ecliptic.|$|E

50|$|Former player Gary Brabin was {{initially}} given the job {{until the end}} of the season and guided the team into the play-offs only to go out on penalties away at Stalybridge Celtic, however only three days later the club announced their ambitions early by appointing him full-time and thus keeping their full-time playing status for another season at least. However, this appointment turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> agreement <b>to</b> sign a future contract, and after an approach from Cambridge United, Brabin left Southport to sign as Cambridge manager on 23 June 2008.|$|R

5|$|The {{automobile}} unions {{played a}} leading role in advancing the cause of women's rights. In 1955, the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) organized the UAW Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies. In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the U.S. Division of Transport Personnel had in 1943 instructed Teamsters Union officials that women should be allowed full employment as truck drivers. That proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> temporary wartime measure, but a change of heart among Teamsters leadership by the mid-1950s led to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Women in the auto industry were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} {{spent the}} next several months in training at locations about the central North Island before embarking for New Caledonia in December. Arriving at Nouméa on 31 December 1942, the battalion was earmarked to be the basis for a new brigade, the 15th. However this proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> short-term measure and by March 1943, it was back with 14th Brigade. While on New Caledonia, the battalion underwent jungle training and performed security duties before departing for Guadalcanal in mid-August 1943. After stopping briefly at the New Hebrides, it arrived at Guadalcanal on 27 August and spent a month here, establishing camps and conducting patrols to monitor for any surprise landings by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Saturn {{are made up}} of objects ranging in size from {{microscopic}} to moonlets hundreds of meters across, each in its own orbit around Saturn. Thus a precise number of Saturnian moons cannot be given, because there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form Saturn's ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons. Over 150 moonlets embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material, though this is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small sample of the total population of such objects.|$|E

5|$|Walker scored what proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> {{consolation}} after scoring in the 84th minute against Tamworth, with York losing 2–1 {{away after}} conceding two penalties, {{both of which}} were awarded from fouls committed by Chris Smith. York's first victory in four matches came after Jamie Reed scored an 88th-minute winner to give the team a 1–0 win at home to Bath City. This was followed by a 3–0 win away to league leaders Wrexham, with first half goals from McLaughlin, Chambers and Reed handing York victory. York then drew 2–2 at home to Darlington; Reed opened the scoring in the second minute with a shot into the top corner {{from the edge of the}} penalty area, and in the 79th minute Walker scored with a curling shot into the top corner to equalise for York. Chambers and Walker scored first half goals as York defeated Luton 3–0 at home. After a four-match unbeaten run York were defeated 3–2 away to Gateshead, with former York loanee Jon Shaw scoring their three goals, and Walker and a Curtis own goal making up York's tally.|$|E
