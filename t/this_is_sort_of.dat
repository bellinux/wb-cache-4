Crowe incorporates how his own fatherhood informed his reading of the script to portray Jor-El, stating that [...] "...it {{was one of those}} things where that's how it was connecting me. That's the question that Jor-El faces, that's the situation that he's in." [...] Crowe also comments on his preparation for the film stating that: [...] "When I signed on... well, one, I didn't realize that I would be wearing Spandex—'cause you know that's Superman's costume—I didn't realize that I'd have to fit into it as well," [...] Crowe said. [...] "But, I also didn't realize the type of organizer that Zack Snyder is, 'cause this was really old school prep. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> David Lean-level preparation, and I really appreciated him.

The video featured the band's fans who played a crowd on a concert by Evanescence. During an interview, Lee revealed that the music video for the song {{was one of the}} band's [...] "realest" [...] videos adding, [...] " [...] this is more a personal video. We've done a lot in the past that [...] very 'fantasy,' and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> the real us. I just wanted to do something that really felt personal for a change. Obviously, I'm wearing crazy makeup, and that's not my everyday, but, you know, I want ... to connect with the fans again. We all do. We miss them. A lot of this record is about them, and that's why they're going to be here and be in it, too." [...] In an interview with MTV News, she described the concept of the video: ...|$|E

500|$|When {{the games}} are {{broadcast}} on Fox, Joe Buck and Tim McCarver call the game and, thus the duo has called many significant moments in the rivalry. In 2004, {{the first game of}} the season between the two teams, on April 16, a Friday night, was nationally broadcast on Fox, because it marked the first time the two teams were facing each other since the memorable 2003 ALCS. Fox Sports President Ed Goren said of decision to have the game broadcast on Fox: [...] "If were up to me, we'd take the whole series and come back a week later and carry all their games at Yankee Stadium...We started thinking about this at some point after the Yankees closed the deal with A-Rod. ... <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a relaunch of the season in the middle of April. This is going to be an event." [...] MLB Commissioner Bud Selig called the broadcast [...] "an extension of the postseason brought into April." [...] This was the first broadcast of a regular season game in prime-time since Mark McGwire hit his 62nd home run to break Roger Maris' record in 1998. In October, when the two teams met in the ALCS, Selig moved Game 5 of the series to primetime due to the rematch.|$|E
500|$|Michael O'Connell of The Hollywood Reporter {{noted that}} the video {{contains}} Beyoncé's [...] "trademark moves". Likewise, Ben Kaye of the website Consequence of Sound wrote, [...] ", we witness the always mesmerizing songstress seducing a private detective with a sultry version of the twisting and twerking she's famous for. Essentially, it's just what you'd expect from the track's lyrics, and that's in no way a bad thing." [...] Contessa Gayles of The Boombox wrote that [...] "Beyoncé rocks the racy shoot in satin hot pants, garters and a slinky wrap dress", further describing her look and the set as [...] "sexy". Matt Donnelly of Los Angeles Times described the video as [...] "sultry" [...] and further found [...] "a Jessica Rabbit vibe". Donnelly also wrote, [...] "The video carries the standard Bey DNA—wind machines, plunging necklines and lots of hair. Not that we're complaining." [...] Derek Johnson of Long Island Press commented that the video is [...] "heating up the Internet and we're pretty sure we know why", referring to Beyoncé's figure. He further commended Beyoncé for taking viewers {{back to the days}} of black and white television and [...] "into the office of a lonely detective on a rainy day. We've all seen that show before, but not like this." [...] Natalie Finn of E! Online compared the video with the one for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] (2008), adding that it [...] "sticks with the power of black and white", and describing the set as [...] "naughty". Katie Hasty of the website HitFix praised Beyoncé's look in the video but commented, [...] "If you're a hetero sexual lady detective, however, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> boring." ...|$|E
2500|$|Loaded was a {{commercial}} effort aimed at radio play, another {{step away from}} the Warhol-influenced experimental days of their earlier albums. The album's title refers to Atlantic's request that the band produce an album [...] "loaded with hits". Singer/bassist Doug Yule said, [...] "On Loaded there was a big push to produce a hit single, there was that mentality, which one of these is a single, how does it sound when we cut it down to 3.5 minutes, so that was a major topic for the group at that point. And I think that the third album to a great extent shows a lot of that in that a lot of those songs were designed as singles and if you listen to them you can hear the derivation, like <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a Phil Spector-ish kind of song, or this is that type of person song." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Bruce Eder awarded the album 3 stars and stated [...] "The {{material}} {{is done in}} a smooth, swinging style, more laid-back than what the Count Basie orchestra of the same period would have done with this same stuff but with enough fire and boundless elegance {{to make it more}} than worthwhile... <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a concept album, and a rather good one at that".|$|E

The Symphony was eventually offered in four cabinet styles.|$|R
5000|$|The band rehearsed for {{the tour}} in Pensacola, Florida, the same city where the tour kicked off.

The holdings of all investors combined must, by equation, be in the cap-weighted proportions. So many investors following this strategy implies some other investors must follow a buy-high, sell-low (trend following) strategy.

On Page 246 of [...] "Against All Enemies," [...] Mr. Clarke bemoans the way the invasion of Iraq, in his view, played right {{into the hands of}} Al Qaeda: 'Bush handed that enemy precisely what it wanted and needed.[...]. It was as if Usama bin Laden, hidden in some high mountain redoubt, were engaging in long-range mind control of George Bush.' That's not '"X-Files" [...] stuff': it's a literary device, meant to emphasize just how ill conceived our policy is. Mr. Blitzer should be telling Mr. Wilkinson to apologize." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1989, {{prior to}} the film's {{broadcast}} on PBS, Irv Letovsky of the Los Angeles Times was blasé, calling the film, [...] "a lot of cute," [...] but [...] "though cute, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a compendium of how things used to be." [...] He noted that [...] "some of the older generation might enjoy the diversion." [...] New Jersey Star-Ledger reviewer Jerry Krupnick found the film [...] "hilarious" [...] and [...] "super fun", but declared that the role Shepherd took on for himself in the first 30 minutes of the film only stretched a [...] "nifty 90-minute comedy" [...] to two hours, and made it [...] "cluttered."

So when they're not listening to her, it's just a snapping point. For me personally, it's the same relationship I have with going to the hospital for the first time for a family member or someone close. It's terrifying and awful, and you're in there and you want to desperately grab the doctor or nurses and be like, 'Tell me what is going on!'" ...|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} holiday (which is however not {{an official}} public holiday) takes place {{each year on}} December 6. This is Sinterklaas in Dutch or la Saint-Nicolas in French (English: Saint Nicholas). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> an early Christmas. On December 5 evening before going to bed, children put their shoes by the hearth with water or wine and a carrot for Saint Nicholas's horse or donkey. According to tradition, St. Nicholas comes at night and travels down the chimney. He then takes the food and water or wine, leaves presents, goes back up, feeds his horse or donkey, and continues on his course. He also knows whether children have been good or bad. This holiday is especially loved by children in Belgium and the Netherlands. Dutch immigrants imported the tradition into the United States, where Saint Nicholas {{is now known as}} Santa Claus.|$|E
