5|$|Cyclone Forrest, also {{referred}} to as Typhoon Forrest, was a powerful tropical cyclone <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> <b>the</b> evacuation of 600,000people in Bangladesh in late November1992. Originating from an area of disturbed weather near the Caroline Islands on November9, Forrest was classified as a tropical depression three days later over the South China Sea. Tracking generally west, the system steadily organized into a tropical storm, passing Vietnam to the south, before striking Thailand along the Malay Peninsula on November15. Once over the Bay of Bengal, Forrest turned northward on November17 and significantly intensified. It reached its peak intensity on November20 as a Category4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 230km/h (145mph). Hostile environmental conditions soon affected the cyclone as it turned abruptly east-northeastward. Forrest made landfall in northwestern Myanmar as a weakening system on November21 before dissipating early the next day.|$|E

Following another population boom after World War II, {{and the creation of}} the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project, the Everglades was divided into sections separated by canals and water control devices that delivered water to agricultural and newly developed urban areas. However, in the late 1960s, following a proposal to construct a massive airport next to Everglades National Park, national attention turned from developing the land to restoring the Everglades.|$|E
