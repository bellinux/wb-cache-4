5|$|A {{pulmonary}} contusion {{is usually}} caused directly by blunt trauma {{but can also}} result from explosion injuries or a shock wave associated with penetrating trauma. With the use of explosives during World Wars I and II, pulmonary contusion resulting from blasts gained recognition. In the 1960s its occurrence in civilians began to receive wider recognition, in which cases it is usually caused by traffic accidents. The use of seat belts and airbags reduces <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> vehicle occupants.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the timber}} was reburied {{as the best}} way of {{preserving}} it, and a survey in 2005 found this to have been quite successful, despite reports warning of the area drying out and the peat coverage being reduced. The site is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage because of <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> the buried timbers if the site dries out further.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} {{eventually}} canceled by the Air Force in January 1959, seemingly {{out of fear}} of a negative public reaction and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> the population should anything have gone wrong with the launch.

Nihilistic's management was committed to the entire team working in a one-room environment with no walls, doors, or offices, believing this would force the individual groups to communicate and allow each department to respond to queries immediately, saving hours or days of development time. Redemptions story was developed with input from Wolf; it was co-written by Daniel Greenberg, {{a writer for the}} source pen-and-paper RPG.|$|E

5|$|After launch, {{the missile}} was guided towards the target {{location}} {{as determined by}} the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 guidance section. The ATA was less accurate than a full-fledged inertial system, but good enough for Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. The missile flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar seeker in the nose was activated to acquire and lock on the target. The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely-known target location but reducing <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> be defeated by enemy Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).|$|E
5|$|After this {{successful}} {{series of}} patrols, Davis {{was ordered to}} conduct only one patrol a day {{in order to minimize}} <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> him. The order had previously been sent on December 1, but Davis had apparently ignored it. Both the Air Force and Davis' family had growing concerns that Chinese and Soviet pilots would be gunning for Davis, given his success and fame. By this point, Davis had 12 victories, and the second-highest scoring aces each had 6 victories. Davis was averaging one victory for three missions.|$|E
5|$|During the North Sea {{flood of}} 1953, Jaywick was flooded, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 35 people. Since then, sea defences have been put in place and many precautions have been made to avoid flooding. Coastal Jaywick has benefited from 30,000 cubic metres of dredged sand as part of a £9.4million upgrade. The residential areas are categorised as having the highest risk of flooding in the country, and a council report anticipated that global warming would increase <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> human life in Jaywick from flooding over the next 50 to 75 years. The area {{would be the first to}} be hit by floods in the event of a tidal surge over the marshes surrounding St Osyth.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, formal futures markets {{appeared}} in the Dutch Republic during the 17th century. Among the most notable centered on the tulip market, {{at the height of}} Tulipmania. At the peak of tulip mania, in February 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsworker. Research is difficult because of the limited economic data from the 1630s—much of which come from biased and very speculative sources. Some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania, for the rise and fall in prices. For example, other flowers, such as the hyacinth, also had high initial prices {{at the time of their}} introduction, which immediately fell. The high asset prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a small cost—thus lowering <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> buyers.|$|E
5|$|In tsunami prone regions, strong {{earthquakes}} {{serve as}} familiar warnings, {{and this is}} especially true for earthquakes in Indonesia. Previous estimates of the tsunami hazard for the Java coastline may have minimized <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> the area, and to the northwest along the Sumatran coast, the risk is substantially higher for tsunami, especially near Padang. Previous events along the coast of Java in 1921 and again in 1994 illustrate the need for an accurate assessment of the threat. The July 2006 earthquake had an unusually slow rupture velocity which resulted in minor shaking on land for around three minutes, but the intensity was very light relative to the size of the tsunami that followed.|$|E
5|$|Poland, {{home of the}} world's largest Jewish {{community}} {{before the}} war, lost 3,300,000 (90percent) of its Jewish population. Although the Germans rigorously imposed {{the death penalty for}} hiding Jews, some Poles hid Jews (saving their lives) despite <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> themselves and their families. Although reports of the Holocaust had reached Western leaders, public awareness in the United States and other democracies of the mass murder of Jews in Poland was low at the time; the first references in The New York Times, in 1942, were unconfirmed reports rather than front-page news.|$|E

5|$|Rain {{affected}} the third Test; {{on the second}} day, Australia declared having scored 200 for nine in their first innings. In reply, England lost regular wickets as the effects of rain made the pitch almost impossible to bat on. Several critics, including {{members of his own}} team, suggested Allen should have declared to force Australia to bat when the pitch remained very difficult. Allen considered <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> be too great and did not declare until the score had reached 76 for nine. Bradman then reversed his batting order to protect his main batsmen until the conditions eased; the tactic worked, as he and Jack Fingleton shared a partnership of 346 for the sixth wicket. Bradman scored 270 and England were defeated by 365 runs. In the fourth Test, Australia were bowled out for 288 in their first innings, when several of Allen's tactical moves worked well. England replied with 330, and Australia scored 433 in the second innings. Needing to score 392 to win, England were bowled out for 243, and the series was level at 2–2.|$|E
5|$|The English {{plan for}} 1673 centred on first {{achieving}} naval dominance, followed by landing an army in Zeeland. The King appointed the Duke as supreme commander, with Rupert as his deputy, combining {{the rank of}} General and Vice Admiral of England. During the winter of 1672, however, Charles—still (legitimately) childless—decided that <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> the Duke, his heir, was too great and made Rupert supreme Allied commander in his place. Rupert began the 1673 campaign against the Dutch knowing the logistical support for his fleet remained uncertain, with many ships undermanned. The result was the Battle of Schooneveld in June and the Battle of Texel in August, a controversial sequence of engagements in which, at a minimum, poor communications between the French and English commanders assisted the marginal Dutch victory. Many English commentators were harsher, blaming the French for failing to fully engage in the battles and Rupert—having cautioned against the alliance in the first place—was popularly hailed as a hero. Rupert finally retired from active seagoing command later that year.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{final report}} {{determined}} that along {{the whole of}} the rocky coast between Land's End and Hartland Point, Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the coasting trade when the most dangerous north-westerly onshore gales were blowing. It noted that Padstow's safety was compromised by the Doom Bar and by the eddy-forming effect of Stepper Point. The report recommended initial expenditure of £20,000 to cut down the outer part of Stepper Point, which, in conjunction with the capstans, bollards and mooring rings, would significantly reduce <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> shipping.|$|E

5|$|The {{large number}} of {{visitors}} at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as ringed plovers and little terns, and also for wintering geese. During the breeding season, the main breeding areas for terns and seals are fenced off and signposted. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle. A boardwalk made from recycled plastic crosses the large sand dunes {{near the end of}} the Point, which helps to reduce erosion. It was installed in 2009 at a cost of £35,000 to replace its much less durable wooden predecessor.
