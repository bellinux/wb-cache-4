The value of <b>pulse</b> <b>time</b> indicates the quantity of reactant per cycle. The longer <b>pulse</b> <b>time</b> lasts, the more precursors enter reactor chamber. The long <b>pulse</b> <b>time</b> wastes precursors and more precursors stick to the surface, which influences the reaction of precursor in the next cycle. On the other hand, the short <b>pulse</b> <b>time</b> causes incomplete reaction between precursor and groups on surface of substrate, which result in the poor quality and uniform of films.|$|R

50|$|The {{tunnel diode}} showed great promise as an {{oscillator}} and high-frequency threshold (trigger) device since it operated at frequencies {{far greater than}} the tetrode could, well into the microwave bands. Applications for tunnel diodes included local oscillators for UHF television tuners, trigger circuits in oscilloscopes, high-speed counter circuits, and very fast-rise <b>time</b> <b>pulse</b> generator circuits. The tunnel diode {{can also be used}} as a low-noise microwave amplifier. However, since its discovery, more conventional semiconductor devices have surpassed its performance using conventional oscillator techniques. For many purposes, a three-terminal device, such as a field-effect transistor, is more flexible than a device with only two terminals. Practical tunnel diodes operate at a few milliamperes and a few tenths of a volt, making them low-power devices. The Gunn diode has similar high frequency capability and can handle more power.|$|E
50|$|The {{vertical}} input is digitized by {{an analog}} to digital converter {{to create a}} data set that is stored in the memory of a microprocessor. The data set is processed and then sent to the display, which in early DSOs was a cathode ray tube, but is now more likely to be an LCD flat panel. DSOs with color LCD displays are common. The data set can be sent over a LAN or a WAN for processing or archiving. The screen image can be directly recorded on paper by means of an attached printer or plotter, without the need for an oscilloscope camera. The oscilloscope's own signal analysis software can extract many useful time-domain features (e.g., rise <b>time,</b> <b>pulse</b> width, amplitude), frequency spectra, histograms and statistics, persistence maps, and a large number of parameters meaningful to engineers in specialized fields such as telecommunications, disk drive analysis and power electronics.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two general}} types of PWM. Each PWM defines a value {{that is used}} by the servo to {{determine}} its expected position. The first type is [...] "absolute" [...] and defines the value by the width of the active-high <b>time</b> <b>pulse</b> with an arbitrarily long period of low time. The second type is [...] "relative" [...] and defines the value by the percentage of time the control is active-high versus low-time. The [...] "absolute" [...] type allows multiple servos to share one communication channel (multiplexing) using relatively simple electronics and is the basis of modern RC servos. The [...] "relative" [...] type is the more traditional usage of PWM whereby a simple low-pass filter converts a [...] "relative" [...] PWM signal into an analog voltage. The two types are both PWM because the servo responds to the width of the pulse. However, in the first case a servo may also be sensitive to pulse order.|$|E
