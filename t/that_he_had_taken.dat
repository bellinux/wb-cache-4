On December 9, 2013, Reso announced on WWE.com <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> time off due to recurring post-concussive symptoms and during the time off his wife gave birth to their first child, a daughter called Isla.|$|E
5|$|Frazier, however, {{searches}} the bank's records and finds that {{safe deposit box}} #392 has never appeared on any records since the bank's founding in 1948. He obtains a search warrant to open it. He is then confronted by White, who informs him of Case's Nazi dealings. She attempts to persuade Frazier to drop his investigation, but he refuses, playing a recording of an incriminating conversation that she had with him. White confronts Case who admits that the box contained diamonds and a ring <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> from a Jewish friend whom he had betrayed to the Nazis.|$|E
5|$|In Tondon Tiku began {{preparations}} for his mother's funeral, preparations which, in Torajan culture, took several months. While {{taking care of}} the preparations, he had an advisor collect weapons secretly while another went to his fortresses in Alla' and Ambeso. Tiku then made preparations to escape Dutch custody; he also returned all property <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> as a lord, as he knew he would no longer use it. While in Tondon, Dutch forces may have harassed the Torajan leader. The night before his mother's funeral, in January 1907, Tiku and 300 of his followers escaped Tondon, heading south.|$|E

5|$|Simpson {{fell ill}} with {{diarrhoea}} during the Tour's tenth stage. He was {{under pressure from}} his personal manager {{to continue in the}} race, though members of his team encouraged him to quit. Near the summit of Mont Ventoux, Simpson fell off of his bike but was able to get back on it. After riding a short distance further, he collapsed. He was pronounced dead after being airlifted to a hospital. The post-mortem examination found <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> amphetamine and alcohol, a diuretic combination which proved fatal when combined with the heat, the hard climb of the Ventoux and the stomach complaint.|$|E
5|$|The {{little that}} is known of Mac Scelling {{suggests}} {{that he was an}} early archetype of what latter became known as gallowglasses, heavily-armed mercenaries, recruited from the West Highlands and Islands of Scotland by Irish rulers in later centuries. Although first specifically recorded in {{the last decade of the}} thirteenth century, gallowglasses were almost certainly utilised at least a generation before. The aforesaid apparent reference to Mac Scelling by La Geste des Engleis en Yrlande could be evidence <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> up residence in Ireland like later gallowglasses.|$|E
5|$|China has had {{an organ}} {{transplantation}} programme since the 1960s. It {{is one of the}} largest organ transplant programmes in the world, peaking at over 13,000 transplants a year in 2004. Involuntary organ harvesting is illegal under Chinese law, although under a 1984 regulation it became legal to remove organs from executed criminals with the prior consent of the criminal or permission of relatives. By the 1990s, growing concerns about possible ethical abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups and human rights organizations to start condemning the practice. These concerns resurfaced in 2001, when The Washington Post reported claims by a Chinese asylum-seeking doctor <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> part in organ extraction operations.|$|E

Corral, Wyatt {{testified that he}} offered the US$3,600 in Wells Fargo reward money ($1,200 per robber) to Ike Clanton and Frank McLaury in return for {{information}} about the identities of the three robbers. Wyatt testified that he had other motives for his plan, as well; he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for election as Cochise County sheriff. Wyatt told the court <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Ike from Wells Fargo assuring that the reward for capturing the killers applied either dead or alive.|$|E
5|$|Epstein {{died of an}} {{overdose}} of Carbitral, a form of barbiturate or sleeping pill, in his locked bedroom, on 27 August 1967. He was discovered after his butler had knocked on the door, and then hearing no response, asked the housekeeper to call the police. Epstein was found on a single bed, dressed in pyjamas, with various correspondence spread over a second single bed. At the statutory inquest his death was officially ruled an accident; caused by a gradual buildup of Carbitral in his system, combined with alcohol. It was revealed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> six Carbitral pills in order to sleep, which was probably normal for him, but in combination with alcohol they reduced his tolerance to lethal levels.|$|E
5|$|Following Jefferson's {{return to}} Grimsby, Marstrand's were puzzled by Orsborne's actions, but {{initially}} thought <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> on another engineer in Dover {{and had gone}} fishing, perhaps in new grounds. There were unconfirmed sightings of Girl Pat in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. As weeks passed with no definite news, the Marstrand directors assumed that the vessel was lost, either through foundering or barratry, and claimed insurance. They had already received sums totalling £2,400 from the underwriters, when they were surprised {{by the arrival of}} bills from Corcubión, together with the news that Girl Pat had sailed from the port on 24 April, her destination unknown.|$|E

5|$|After further investigation, it was {{revealed}} on 22 October 2003 that Chambers had {{tested positive for the}} banned steroid THG. Analysis of his backup sample also tested positive and the outcome was confirmed on 7 November 2003, making Chambers the first person to test positive for the new drug. Chambers was suspended the same day with an independent UK Athletics tribunal pending. The disciplinary hearing on 24 February 2004 resulted in a two-year ban from athletics, backdated to begin on 7 November 2003. He was also banned for life from the Olympics and stripped of the medals he had won since mid-2002, after admitting <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> THG from that date. Chambers' 2002 relay gold medal performance was erased, costing teammates Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Christian Malcolm their medals in the process. Chambers was also ordered by the IAAF to pay back his earnings from the period of his athletics career that was affected by his drug abuse.|$|E
5|$|As Democrats {{took control}} of the House in 1875, Randall was {{considered}} among the candidates for Speaker of the House. Many in the caucus hesitated, however, believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money question. His leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him, as well. Randall was also occupied by an intra-party battle with William A. Wallace for control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Wallace, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874, was weakened by rumors <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> bribes from the railroads while a member of the State Senate. Randall wanted control of the Democratic machine statewide, and the Wallace faction's vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity. In January 1875, he had friends in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace's clique, which ultimately turned state Democratic leaders against the senator. At the state Democratic convention in September 1875, Randall (with the help of his old ally, Squire McMullen) triumphed, putting his men in control of the state party.|$|E
5|$|Pickett's first combat command {{was during}} the Peninsula Campaign, leading a brigade that was nicknamed the Gamecocks (the brigade would {{eventually}} be led by Richard B. Garnett in Pickett's Charge). Pickett led his brigade ably in the battles of Williamsburg and Seven Pines, earning commendations from his superiors. At Gaines's Mill on June 27 he was shot off his horse while leading his brigade in its first assault. Pickett continued {{to move forward with}} his men for a while, leading his horse on foot. A second assault by Pickett's brigade, led by Colonel Eppa Hunton, along with the brigade led by Cadmus M. Wilcox, broke the Union line. Pickett feared <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> a mortal blow to his shoulder, but the wound was initially assessed by others as minor. The shoulder wound turned out to be severe enough that, while not fatal, Pickett was out of action for the next three months, and his arm would remain stiff for at least a year.|$|E

5|$|Reich {{responded with}} a 25-page letter in which he tried to change Einstein's mind. To rule out the {{influence}} of convection he told Einstein <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> certain measures, including introducing a horizontal plate above the accumulator, wrapping it in a blanket, hanging it from the ceiling, burying it underground and placing it outside. He wrote that in all these circumstances the temperature difference remained, and was in fact more marked in the open air. Einstein {{did not respond to}} this or to Reich's future correspondence– Reich would write regularly reporting the results of his experiments– until Reich threatened three years later to publish their previous exchange. Einstein replied that he could not devote any further time to the matter and asked that his name not be misused for advertising purposes. Reich believed that Einstein's change of heart was part of a conspiracy of some kind, perhaps related to the communists or prompted by the rumours that Reich was ill. Reich published the correspondence in 1953 as The Einstein Affair.|$|E

25|$|In July 2008, Haaretz {{reported}} that in 1992, Olmert took a loan from U.S. businessman Joe Almaliah, but never repaid it, and concealed the true size of the loan from the State Comptroller. In March 2003, State Comptroller Eliezer Goldberg asked Olmert to submit the wealth-declaration statement required of all cabinet ministers. Olmert disclosed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> a loan from Almaliah, but did not say when it was due. In 2004, Olmert conceded <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> $75,000, and stressed that Almaliah had not asked for repayment of the loan. At Goldberg's insistence, Olmert {{signed a contract with}} Almaliah undertaking to repay the loan in January 2009. According to an indictment, Olmert had actually taken another $100,000 from Almaliah, which was deposited into his personal bank account. The State Prosecutor's office said that it was not aware of Olmert's repayment of either loan.|$|E
25|$|In March 2015, Olmert {{was convicted}} in Jerusalem District Court of fraud, breach of trust, and tax evasion in his retrial on {{corruption}} charges over the Talansky case.
