5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} found {{that after a}} June 17 replacement of a <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> component at what became {{the site of the}} June 22 collision, the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> had been suffering from parasitic oscillations which left it unable to reliably report when that stretch of track was occupied by a train. The struck train came to a stop because of traffic ahead. Because the entire train was within the faulty circuit, it became invisible to the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system. The train behind it was therefore commanded to proceed at 55mph. The operator of the striking train applied the emergency brake after the stopped train came into full view but there was not enough time to prevent the collision, which occurred at approximately 44mph.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{majority}} of all subway delays are caused by signal problems. Whenever a <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> stops working, all of the signals which are affected by it turn red, as it is uncertain {{whether there is a}} train in that section, and the system properly reverts to a safe state.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2007, the Staten Island Railway used Baltimore & Ohio Railroad style color {{position}} light signals that dated {{back to when}} it was a B line. In 2007, a $72 million project to replace the old signal system was completed. The system was replaced with an FRA-compliant 100Hz, <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> based, Automatic Train Control (ATC) signal system. As part of the project, forty R44 subway cars and four locomotives were modified with on board cab signaling equipment for ATC bi-directional movement. A new rail control center and back-up control center was constructed as part of this contract.|$|E

50|$|Partial double {{switching}} might {{double switch}} the lever controls, and the <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> between one signal and the next, while single switching the <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> {{in the less}} critical overlap beyond the next signal.|$|R
25|$|Since that time, {{training}} {{and procedures for}} signal electricians have been strengthened and it is clearly stated in railway rules that {{in the event of}} a <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> failure, no attempt shall be made to clear any of the signals controlled by the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> by manipulation of the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> relay...|$|E
25|$|The line is {{monitored}} from the Operations Control Center (OCC). Responsibility for controlling service {{is shared by}} the control room and field personnel along the right of way. <b>Track</b> <b>circuit</b> and signal indications are not transmitted to the operational personnel sites. In lieu of <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> indications, the AVI system is displayed {{in the control room}} to provide a periodic update to train position wherever AVI detectors exist. The AVI system user interface was solely text based until the current control room was opened, in which a new schematic display based on AVI data was instituted. <b>Track</b> <b>circuit</b> indications are available digitally in signal houses at the Park Street interlocking, at the new North Station interlocking, and at the new Kenmore interlocking, but are not transmitted to OCC. In January 2013, the MBTA announced plans to add full vehicle location tracking on the Green Line for countdown signs and smartphone applications, including using AVI data in the tunnels and GPS receivers on the surface lines. The first real-time data—location data on the surface lines—became available in October 2014. Full tracking is expected by early 2015.|$|E
25|$|When {{insulated}} {{to prevent}} conduction through the ties, steel ties {{may be used}} with <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> based train detection and track integrity systems. Without insulation, steel ties may only be used on lines without block signaling and level crossings or on lines that use other forms of train detection such as axle counters.|$|E
50|$|The {{accident}} {{would have}} been prevented if the line had been fitted with <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> which would have prevented the block instruments and the signals from being cleared. However, at the time <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> were relatively new.|$|R
50|$|The system {{consists}} of coded <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> and on-board equipment. The coded <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> transmit {{information about the}} signal aspect to the on-board equipment via two pick-up coils mounted {{on the front of}} the train, one over each rail.|$|R
50|$|Where DC {{traction}} {{is used on}} {{the running}} line or on tracks in close proximity then DC <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> cannot be used, similarly if 50 Hz AC electrification is used then 50 Hz AC <b>track</b> <b>circuits</b> cannot be used.|$|R
25|$|Nicole {{failed to}} make the {{national}} finals in 2013 but made her international debut at the Summer Universiade and made the 1500m final, placing eighth. In her first appearance on the major international <b>track</b> <b>circuit,</b> she set a 3000m best of 8:55.48 minutes to place tenth at the adidas Grand Prix in New York.|$|E
25|$|The Automatic Train Protection {{sub-system}} uses coded <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> technology originally {{supplied by}} Rochester, New York-based General Railway Signal when {{the line was}} constructed in the 1970s. It is a life-critical system that provides a continuous stream of information to the train regarding the maximum safe speed via the running rails. Speed commands are designed to ensure trains maintain a safe stopping distance from any obstruction and do not exceed the speed limit for any segment of track. The system stops trains in advance of any other train traffic, and before stop signals at interlockings. The cab signalling system relies on track circuits to detect track occupancy, and thus send the appropriate speed code. Although the ATP system {{was designed to be}} fail-safe, the <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> control equipment on which it relies has been prone to parasitic oscillations which can cause the system intermittently to fail to detect the presence of a train. This resulted in the 2009 collision, after which Metro began to operate all trains manually. In September 2014, Metro began reintroducing its computerized control system after taking a number of measures to avoid accidents similar to the 2009 accident.|$|E

Second place to Margaret Muriuki at the Kenya Cross Country Championships brough her selection for the senior national team, and finished tenth at the 2013 IAAF World Cross Country Championships (although only fifth best among the winning Kenyan team). She competed on the IAAF Diamond League <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> {{for the first time that}} year and managed personal bests of 8:56.20 minutes and 14:50.99 minutes for the 3000m and 5000m.|$|E
25|$|About 30 {{seconds before}} {{arriving}} at the crossing, the train trips a <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> near the crossing, triggering the crossing signals. The lights begin to flash alternately, and a bell (or bells) mounted at the crossing begins ringing. After several seconds of flashing lights and ringing bells, the crossing gates (if equipped) begin to lower, which usually takes 5–10 seconds. Some AWDs silence the bell once the gates are fully lowered (typically seen on most Norfolk Southern and CSX crossings); most continue ringing the bells throughout (Union Pacific, BNSF Railway). Some crossings will not sound the bell at all after dark in the case that it is installed near a residential area. The lights continue to flash throughout regardless.|$|E

25|$|At {{switches}} {{entering into}} pocket tracks {{in a direction}} reverse to the normal operating direction, there is a “P Signal”. The P Signal is a single lunar signal that displays the letter “P” and is found {{at the entrance to}} some but not all pocket tracks and other selected main line interlockings in the reverse direction of the normal flow of traffic. Below the P signal on the same post is a punch box to allow the train operator to manually set the switch to the diverting direction (reverse) when the P Signal is lit. The P signal is only lit when a train occupies the two <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> approaching the P Signal and all possible routes into the interlocking are not occupied.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 1993 season, he won the Almond Blossom Cross Country. He ran on the European <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> and greatly {{improved}} his 5000m best, running a time of 13:25.79 minutes at the Bislett Games in Oslo. He also ran bests over 3000 metres (7:43.20 min) and for 10,000 metres (27:24.24 min). As one of the fastest runners that year, he was given entry into the 5000m at the 1993 IAAF Grand Prix Final and came sixth. He ended the year with a win at the Cross Internacional de la Constitución and a third title at the San Silvestre Vallecana. His 1994 was highlighted by a consecutive win at the Almond Blossom meet and a career best over the 5000m of 13:16.39 minutes in London.|$|E
25|$|Some level {{crossings}} that are located close to intersections with traffic lights program the signals with a preemption sequence {{so when the}} approaching train trips the <b>track</b> <b>circuit,</b> it not only activates the crossing signals, but also changes the traffic lights facing the crossing to green, to clear any traffic that may be queued on the crossing. If the intersection's stop line is right before the tracks (typically sharing the crossing's stop line), the track circuits would change the traffic lights to red (often without a yellow phase). Some track circuits place the signals into flash mode the entire time the AWDs are active. In cases where railroads share {{the right of way}} with vehicular traffic, simple railroad preemption may cause an all-red flash in traffic lights.|$|E

25|$|The accusations {{brought about}} the end of Robinson's career at the age of 25 as he was largely blacklisted by {{promoters}} on the European <b>track</b> <b>circuit.</b> In spite of this, he stood by the statements he had made in his interviews. His personal life grew increasingly difficult after his retirement. One of his children was beaten to death by the mother and when his daughter, by another woman, moved to Canada he was blocked from seeing her. An attempt to take his daughter back to the United States resulted in charges for assault and abduction, and he served five months in jail. He began seeing a psychiatrist in Tacoma, but twice attempted suicide in 1996. He married former US skier Lisl Hager in the late 1990s and retreated from public life, refusing to take calls from the press and asking to be left alone.|$|E
25|$|Building {{upon his}} success in {{regional}} competition, {{he ran for the}} first time indoors at the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships, reaching the semi-finals and setting an indoor best of 46.83 seconds. He made a strong start on major <b>track</b> <b>circuit,</b> finishing second at the Doha Diamond League meeting with a time of 44.88 seconds. He was second at the Golden Spike Ostrava, then had a winning run of 44.45 seconds at the FBK Games, which ranked him third on the all-time junior lists. He also ran a national junior record of 20.73 seconds for the 200 metres that month. His first Diamond League win followed at the Adidas Grand Prix, where he beat former World and Olympic champion Jeremy Wariner. A day later he ran at the 2012 Ibero-American Championships in Athletics in Barquisimeto with the Dominican relay team, taking a bronze medal and securing their place at the Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Her {{place on}} the Kenyan world cross country team looked {{uncertain}} in 2009 as head coach Julius Kirwa dismissed her chances, saying she had run too many races that season. Cherono replied by taking the lead immediately at the Kenyan Trials and winning the junior race {{by a margin of}} thirteen seconds. At the 2009 World Cross Country Championships in Amman, Cherono engaged in a race-long duel with Genzebe Dibaba in the junior race. Cherono took the lead in the final stages but a difficult stretch with a 40-metre climb enabled Dibaba to overtake her and Cherono ended up with the silver medal. At the 2009 African Junior Athletics Championships, Cherono eased to the 3000m title by some 13 seconds but found herself beaten again by Genzebe Dibaba in 5000m race, finishing with the silver medal. She competed on the senior <b>track</b> <b>circuit</b> that year and was third at the Rieti IAAF Grand Prix, recording a personal best of 8:44.67 for the 3000m. She took third for a second time at the Memorial van Damme in September, recording personal bests in the 1500 metres and 2000 metres and beaten only by reigning world champions Gelete Burka and Vivian Cheruiyot.|$|E
