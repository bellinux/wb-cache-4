5|$|Thus, in the {{presence}} of the inhibitor, the enzyme's effective Km and Vmax become (α/α')Km and (1/α')Vmax, respectively.

In these cases, it is usually more practical to <b>treat</b> <b>the</b> tight-binding inhibitor as an irreversible inhibitor (see below); however, it can still be possible to estimate Ki' kinetically if Ki is measured independently.|$|E
