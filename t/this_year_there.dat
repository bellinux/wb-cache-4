25|$|The Brynmor Jones Library, {{which houses}} {{more than a}} million volumes, was {{constructed}} in two phases: the first phase was fully completed in 1959, with a tower block extension officially opened in 1970. During the 1950s and 1960s a considerable number of academic buildings were built, including the Larkin and Wilberforce Buildings (originally given other names). The 'Martin Plan' of 1967, Sir Leslie Martin was the university architect, envisaged a campus with its tallest buildings in the centre surrounded by buildings diminishing in height towards the perimeter. In the course of the 1960s most of the departments housed in temporary structures were moved into new purpose-built premises.

However, student numbers doubled in this period, with the university becoming highly efficient in using its existing building stock.|$|E
