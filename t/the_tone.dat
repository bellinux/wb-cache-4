5|$|Southern Min dialects undergo {{considerable}} tone sandhi, i.e. {{changes to}} <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> {{depending on the}} position of the syllable in any given sentence or utterance. However, like pinyin for Mandarin Chinese, POJ always marks the citation tone (i.e. the original, pre-sandhi tone) rather than <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> which is actually spoken. This means that when reading aloud the reader must adjust <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> markings on the page to account for sandhi. Some textbooks for learners of Southern Min mark both the citation tone and the sandhi tone to assist the learner.|$|E

That is to say, the timbre is associated in experience with the receipt of gratification, has acquired a pleasure-giving quality, and consequently <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> which in music have an allied timbre become pleasure-giving and are called beautiful. Not that this is the sole cause of their pleasure-giving quality.... Still, in recalling <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> of instruments which approach <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> of <b>the</b> human voice, and observing that they seem beautiful in proportion to their approach, we see that this secondary æsthetic element is important." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{early years}} of the new canal were marred by legal {{disputes}} with the Conservators of the River Tone. The connection to <b>the</b> <b>Tone</b> at Taunton had been made forcibly, by the Canal Company breaching the bank of the river. In August 1827 they announced that they were taking over <b>the</b> <b>Tone,</b> and evicted William Goodland, the river superintendent, from his cottage. Despite a ruling by the Court of King's Bench that their action was illegal, the Canal Company held on to the river until a High Court judgement in February 1830. The Conservators promptly built a dam, to prevent boats reaching the river and water entering the canal, which they removed after further legal action and an Order of the Chancery Court. Reconciliation finally came in late 1831, when the two parties proposed a new Act of Parliament to authorise the sale of <b>the</b> <b>Tone</b> Navigation to the Canal Company. This was obtained in July 1832, and required the Canal Company to erect a new iron bridge to replace the existing North Town Bridge, which hampered access to the wharfs in Taunton. They also had powers to construct a lock and a short length of canal at French Weir, to connect with the Grand Western Canal, while the Conservators were allowed to conduct an annual inspection of the canal, and to resume their ownership of the river if the canal was not maintained in good order.|$|E
5|$|The {{early years}} of the twentieth century saw tone {{clusters}} elevated to central roles in pioneering works by ragtime artists Jelly Roll Morton and Scott Joplin. In the 1910s, two classical avant-gardists, composer-pianists Leo Ornstein and Henry Cowell, were recognized as making the first extensive explorations of <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> cluster. During the same period, Charles Ives employed them in several compositions that were not publicly performed until the late 1920s or 1930s. Composers such as Béla Bartók and, later, Lou Harrison and Karlheinz Stockhausen became proponents of <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> cluster, which feature in the work of many 20th- and 21st-century classical composers. Tone clusters play a significant role, as well, in the work of free jazz musicians such as Cecil Taylor and Matthew Shipp.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The present {{experiments}} {{evaluated the}} effect of relative frequency as a determinant of the figure-ground organization of sequences of auditory tones. Observers counted sequences of 20 ms tones that were presented at the same frequency or that alternated between two different frequencies. <b>The</b> alternating <b>tones</b> differed in frequency by one whole tone, seven tones, or nineteen tones. Counting accuracy increased with increases in the silent interval between <b>the</b> <b>tones.</b> When <b>the</b> alternating <b>tones</b> differed by seven or nineteen tones, counting was disrupted at rates of presentation of eight tones per second or slower. In contrast to this decrement in <b>the</b> counting of <b>tones</b> that alternated by over an octave, very little decrement was observed when <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> alternated by just one whole <b>tone.</b> <b>The</b> best subjects counted these alternating tones more accurately than <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> presented at <b>the</b> same frequency. The poorest subjects showed a small decrement even when <b>the</b> <b>tones</b> alternated by just one whole <b>tone.</b> <b>The</b> results were {{discussed in terms of}} determinants of figure-ground organization in auditory information processing. ...|$|R
5|$|The lip {{position}} and pressure, shaping of the vocal tract, choice of reed and mouthpiece, amount of air pressure created, and evenness of the airflow account {{for most of}} the clarinetist's ability to control <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> of a clarinet. A highly skilled clarinetist will provide the ideal lip and air pressure for each frequency (note) being produced. They will have an embouchure which places an even pressure across the reed by carefully controlling their lip muscles. The airflow will also be carefully controlled by using the strong stomach muscles (as opposed to the weaker and erratic chest muscles) and they will use the diaphragm to oppose the stomach muscles to achieve a tone softer than a forte rather than weakening the stomach muscle tension to lower air pressure. Their vocal tract will be shaped to resonate at frequencies associated with <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> being produced.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper aims to {{investigate}} the features of surface electromyography (sEMG) which can classify the Thai tonal sound for the EMG speech recognition and synthesis system. Signals were captured at seven positions on the strap muscles as a subject was uttering nine monosyllabic words which each of the words includes five tones. Eight features, i. e.

Moreover, RMS, VAR and WL can classify <b>the</b> high <b>tone</b> better than other features. All of the Spectral Moments yield similarly the results of classification, especially they can classify well <b>the</b> rising <b>tone.</b> For <b>the</b> remainder of <b>the</b> <b>tones,</b> while <b>the</b> scatter graphs are considered without <b>the</b> rising <b>tone</b> and <b>the</b> high <b>tone,</b> <b>the</b> low <b>tone</b> can be separated from their group when WL or WAMP is used for classification only...|$|R
