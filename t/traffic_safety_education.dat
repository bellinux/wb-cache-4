40|$|AbstractThis paper studies {{modes of}} <b>safety</b> <b>{{education}},</b> that is, education {{required for the}} development of a safe and secure society (i. e., a resilient and sustainable society), particularly in the context of Japan. In addition, this paper aims to verify what kind of <b>safety</b> <b>education</b> should be provided through the new educational concept of “Education for Sustainable Development” (ESD). In recent years, Japan has suffered a number of serious incidents in school zones, cases of children being kidnapped or killed, as well as the damage caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake & Tsunami of March 11, 2011, and other natural disasters. Consequently, the safety and security of children has become the responsibility of society as a whole, not just of educators. Based on this awareness, this paper will discuss a new mode of <b>safety</b> <b>education</b> that can contribute to the design of mobility for the coming age. There are two main findings from this study. First, the paper identifies the need to provide multiple software support for existing <b>safety</b> <b>education.</b> Few <b>safety</b> <b>education</b> programs have sufficiently incorporated the perspective of understanding safety in a comprehensive manner, instead focusing on a particular area of traffic, disasters, or daily life. In light of this issue, this paper recognizes the importance of incorporating the perspective of problem-solving and participation-oriented ESD into a holistic understanding of <b>safety</b> <b>education.</b> Second, awareness surveys conducted by the author on parents and teachers revealed that the respondents demonstrated a high interest <b>traffic</b> <b>safety</b> relative to other <b>safety</b> <b>education</b> areas. It would thus appear to be possible to make “traffic” the starting point for <b>safety</b> <b>education</b> and then broaden the scope to daily life and disasters. The survey also clarified that related parties considered raising children's awareness to be the most important aspect in <b>safety</b> <b>education.</b> This paper concludes that it is imperative to make continued research efforts to present a new mode of <b>safety</b> <b>education,</b> an initiative that represents one of the important efforts in designing mobility for the future...|$|R

The results show that migrant workers have {{a low level of}} <b>traffic</b> <b>safety</b> <b>education</b> and a lack of traffic safety knowledge (correct rate 56. 57 %). Local migrant workers and non-local migrant workers have a significant difference (p-value 0. 002) in traffic safety knowledge.

It was important to find out what can be done by parents and school to teach <b>traffic</b> <b>safety</b> <b>education</b> to learners. Key concepts like values, attitudes, traffic, safety and. education are discussed in details in this study. A group of learners was selected from fifteen primary schools in Potchefstroom to conduct this study. The main aim was to determine their values and attitudes towards traffic safety and <b>traffic</b> <b>safety</b> <b>education.</b> A questionnaire was developed whereby learners, their parents and their teachers had to fill it out in order to reach the objectives of this study. From. the response of learners, it was evident that learners really value their safety and that it is important for them to be safe road users. They even showed interest in including road safety education in their school curriculum. The school and parents also showed interest in <b>traffic</b> <b>safety</b> <b>education</b> being included in their children's school curriculum. They even opted to help teaching their children. The response of the learners, teachers and parents was positive and this indicated how possible it can be to implement/teach <b>traffic</b> <b>safety</b> <b>education</b> in schools.

A seven-year data base of car accidents has been compiled from police reports, including the results of traffic counts at intersections and other collision locations. In addition, topographic and filmed reports of such places and their surroundings bring about parameters such as stop lines, visibility triangles, road size, traffic light performance, etc., which allow to carrying out of a traffic flow analysis for proposing measures aiming to minimize accidents.
