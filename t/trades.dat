40|$|<b>Trade</b> {{theories}} covering Preferential <b>Trade</b> Agreements (PTAs) are {{as diverse}} as the literature in search of their empirical support. To account for the model uncertainty that surrounds the validity of the competing PTA theories, we introduce Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to the PTA literature. BMA minimizes the sum of Type I and Type II error, the mean squared error, and generates predictive distributions with optimal predictive performance. Once model uncertainty is addressed as part of the empirical strategy, we report clear evidence of <b>Trade</b> Creation, <b>Trade</b> Diversion, and Open Bloc effects. After controlling for natural <b>trading</b> partner effects, <b>Trade</b> Creation is weaker - except for the EU. To calculate the actual effects of PTAs on <b>trade</b> flows we show that the analysis must be comprehensive: it must control for <b>Trade</b> Creation and Diversion as well as all possible PTAs.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{measuring the}} impact of Preferential <b>Trade</b> Agreements (PTA) and WTO membership on <b>trade</b> flows has produced remarkably diverse results. Rose''s (2004) seminal paper reports a range of specifications that show no WTO effects, but Subramanian and Wei (2007) contend {{that he does not}} fully control for multilateral resistance (which could bias WTO estimates). Subramanian and Wei (2007) address multilateral resistance comprehensively to report strong WTO <b>trade</b> effects for industrialized countries but do not account for unobserved bilateral heterogeneity (which could inflate WTO estimates). We unify these two approaches by accounting for both multilateral resistance and unobserved bilateral heterogeneity, while also allowing for individual <b>trade</b> effects of PTAs. WTO effects vanish and remain insignificant throughout once multilateral resistance, unobserved bilateral heterogeneity, and individual PTA effects are introduced. The result is robust to the use of alternative definitions and coding conventions for WTO membership that have been employed by Rose (2004), Tomz et al. (2007), or by Subramanian and Wei''s (2007).

An augmented gravity model is used to compare actual with expected levels of <b>trade.</b> <b>Trade</b> barriers, political uncertainty, and over-appreciation of domestic currencies seem to explain low levels of international <b>trade.</b> At the intra-regional level, specific <b>trade</b> barriers between Israel and other Mashreq countries reduce further levels of <b>trade.</b> Quite surprisingly, removing Israel from the sample leads to higher actual intra-regional <b>trade</b> than predicted. The analysis suggests that <b>trade</b> liberalization, correction of currency misalignments, reduction of political uncertainty, and improved <b>trade</b> relations with Israel would boost <b>trade</b> in the region.

40|$|South-South <b>trade</b> {{agreements}} are proliferating: Developing countries signed 70 new agreements between 1990 and 2003. Yet {{the impact of}} these agreements is largely unknown. This paper focuses on the static effects of South-South preferential <b>trade</b> agreements stemming from changes in <b>trade</b> patterns. Specifically, it estimates the impact of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) on Uganda''s imports between 1994 and 2003. Detailed import and tariff data at the 6 -digit harmonized system level are used for more than 1, 000 commodities. Based on a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, the paper finds that-in contrast to evidence from aggregate statistics-COMESA''s preferential tariff liberalization has not considerably increased Uganda''s <b>trade</b> with member countries, on average across sectors. The effect, however, is heterogeneous across sectors. Finally, the paper finds no evidence of trade-diversion effects.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the euro generated substantial interest in measuring the impact of currency unions (CUs) on <b>trade</b> flows. Rose''s (2000) initial estimates suggested a tripling of <b>trade</b> and created a literature in search of "more reasonable" CU effects. A recent meta-analysis of this literature shows that subsequent papers quantify CU <b>trade</b> impacts at 30 - 90 percent. However, most recent studies use shorter time series and fewer countries than Rose in his original work. We revisit Rose''s original benchmark, extend the dataset, and address Baldwin''s (2006) critiques regarding the proper specification of gravity models in large panels by simultaneously accounting for multilateral resistance and unobserved bilateral heterogeneity. This produces a robust average CU <b>trade</b> effect of 45 percent. Yet, the <b>trade</b> impacts of individual CUs vary substantially and are generally lower than those of preferential <b>trade</b> agreements (PTAs). Our revised benchmark {{can be used as a}} yardstick for future studies to delineate how estimates differ due to new data or differences in econometric specifications.

Our empirical findings suggest that, in principle, membership in a currency union should benefit Africa as much as it does the rest of the world. In addition, we find evidence from both samples that the effect of currency unions on <b>trade</b> is large, almost a doubling; currency unions are associated with <b>trade</b> creation, increase price co-movements among members, and make <b>trade</b> more stable; and longer duration of currency union membership brings about more benefits, although with some diminishing returns.

40|$|With China''s {{accession}} to the WTO in 2001, Russia {{is by far}} that organization''s most prominent nonmember. This paper applies the gravity model to gauge whether this "outsider" status has been affecting Russia''s export structure. On the basis of cross-section and panel regressions for 1995 - 2002, we find that Russian exports to WTO members have fallen short of the model''s predictions. The paper discusses possible explanations of this result, including Russia''s exclusion from various WTO procedures, although own-export restrictions could have a similar effect. The model points to Russia''s further <b>trade</b> reorientation toward WTO members after a putative accession.
