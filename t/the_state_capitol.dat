5|$|A {{little over}} {{an hour after the}} committee's meeting, Governor Taylor {{declared}} a state of insurrection and called out the state militia. He called the legislature into special session, not in Frankfort, but in heavily Republican London, which he insisted was a safer location. Defiant Democratic legislators refused to heed the call to London, but when they attempted to convene first in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>capitol</b> and later in other public locations in Frankfort, they found the doors barred by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in, and immediately ordered the state militia to stand down. He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort. The Republican militia refused to disband, and a rival Democratic militia formed across the lawn of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>capitol.</b> Civil war seemed possible.|$|E

5|$|Although the Texas Legislature {{typically}} meets {{once every}} two years, a fire destroyed <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>capitol</b> building in November 1881, and Ross was called to serve in a special session in April 1882.

He declined to run again.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Armed men from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky filled the capital. On the morning of January 30, 1900, as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building, shots were fired, and Goebel fell wounded. After being denied entrance to <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>capitol</b> by armed men, the contest committee met in Frankfort's city hall and, by a strict party-line vote, adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices. When Democratic legislators attempted to convene to approve the committee's report, they found the doors to <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>capitol</b> and other public locations in Frankfort blocked by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify {{the findings of the}} contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Still lying on his sick bed, Goebel took the oath of office.|$|E

Two mine explosions in Letcher County killed 26 people, and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire claimed 165 lives. Many of these disasters led to stricter enforcement of safety laws. Carroll formed the Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction and strengthened the state fire marshal's office.|$|E

5|$|The West Florida Seminary, {{also known}} as the Florida State Seminary, opened for classes in Tallahassee in 1857, {{absorbing}} the Florida Institute, which had been established as an inducement for the state to place the seminary in the city.

The area, slightly west of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>Capitol,</b> was formerly and ominously known as Gallows Hill, a place for public executions in early Tallahassee.

As Goebel lay in a nearby hotel being treated for his wounds, the committee issued its report recommending that the General Assembly invalidate enough votes to give the election to Goebel.
