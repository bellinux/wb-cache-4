5|$|In the sonnet, <b>the</b> <b>poet</b> {{writes of}} why he has stopped {{showering}} his muse with flowery praise and adoration. In his analysis of Shakespeare's Sonnets, David West suggests that the sequence of sonnets 100-103 and the silence described are {{a response to the}} infidelity of the Fair Youth in the Rival Poet sequence of sonnets (78-86), which has caused a rift between <b>the</b> <b>poet</b> and his Muse. He writes of how immediately following the Rival Poet sonnets, <b>the</b> <b>Poet</b> begins to speak of his lover being false and having forsaken him. West claims that this ultimately culminates in sonnets 100-103, where <b>the</b> <b>Poet</b> expresses his regret over what has transpired.|$|E

5|$|Some 20th-century {{literary}} theorists, relying less on {{the opposition}} of prose and poetry, focused on <b>the</b> <b>poet</b> as simply one who creates using language, and poetry as what <b>the</b> <b>poet</b> creates. The underlying concept of <b>the</b> <b>poet</b> as creator is not uncommon, and some modernist poets essentially do not distinguish between {{the creation of a}} poem with words, and creative acts in other media. Yet other modernists challenge the very attempt to define poetry as misguided.|$|E
