50|$|Plotz {{does not}} stop <b>the</b> <b>Warners</b> from {{reaching}} <b>the</b> star {{at the same time}} as all the other townsfolk. However, the King's army has already built a military base around the star, and a small ice palace to the side of it, and the townspeople (including Plotz) are all captured and locked up so that the King may have his wish. <b>The</b> <b>Warners</b> hint that <b>the</b> wishing process is not as simple as the king thinks in a desperate bluff. The King captures <b>the</b> <b>Warners</b> and tortures them in outlandish ways (from a terrible singer, a filthy gas station restroom, and a parody of Barney <b>the</b> Dinosaur). <b>The</b> <b>Warners</b> tell <b>the</b> King any wish he makes could have an ironic twist and demonstrate this to his annoyance. He orders <b>the</b> <b>Warners</b> executed, but Dot uses her charms to save them. <b>The</b> <b>Warners</b> escape.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Warners</b> {{starred in}} <b>the</b> feature-length, direct-to-video movie Wakko's Wish. The movie {{takes place in}} the fictional town of Acme Falls, in which <b>the</b> <b>Warners</b> and <b>the</b> rest of the Animaniacs cast are under the rule of a greedy king who conquered their home country from a {{neighboring}} country. When <b>the</b> <b>Warners</b> find out about a star that will grant a wish to the first person that touches it, <b>the</b> <b>Warners,</b> <b>the</b> villagers (the Animaniacs cast), and the king race to get to it first. Although children and adults rated Wakko's Wish highly in test-screenings, Warner Bros. decided to release it direct-to-video, rather than spend money on advertising. <b>Warner</b> Bros. released <b>the</b> movie on VHS on December 21, 1999; the film was then released on DVD on October 7, 2014.|$|R

5|$|Artistically, the Grand National {{experiment}} {{was a success}} for Cagney, {{who was able to}} move away from his traditional Warner Bros. tough guy roles to more sympathetic characters.

500|$|As the 1930s {{came to an}} end, both Jack and Harry Warner became {{increasingly}} alarmed over the rise of Nazism. As Bernard F. Dick observed, <b>the</b> <b>Warners,</b> [...] "as sons of Polish Jews who fled their homeland because of antisemitic pogroms... had a personal interest in exposing Nazism." [...] Moreover, the attraction to films critical of German militarism {{had a long history}} with <b>the</b> <b>Warners</b> that predated their production of My Four Years in Germany in 1918. In 1917, while it was still in distribution, <b>the</b> <b>Warners</b> had secured <b>the</b> rights for War Brides, a movie that featured Alla Nazimova as [...] "a woman who kills herself rather than breed children for an unidentified country whose army looks suspiciously Teutonic." ...|$|R
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{was scheduled}} to begin on June 14, 2010, in Los Angeles on a budget of $12 million. Filming took place over twenty-five nights between 5pm and 5am on <b>the</b> <b>Warner</b> Ranch in Burbank, California. The set contained a faux residential area featuring multiple houses. The house belonging to Thomas was situated directly opposite the house used by Danny Glover's character Roger Murtaugh in the Silver-produced 1987 action film Lethal Weapon.|$|E
5|$|The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., {{was filmed}} {{primarily}} on <b>the</b> <b>Warner</b> Bros. soundstages. Town and street scenes were staged on the Western backlot, known as Laramie Street. It {{was one of}} the last Western shows to use the backlot. Cuse said that logistics were a problem because so many of the Hollywood Western sets and towns had been torn down by the 1990s. Outdoor scenes were shot on <b>the</b> <b>Warner</b> Bros. ranch in Valencia, California; Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles; and the Valuze Ranch in Santa Clarita, California. Some of the locomotive scenes from Brisco were filmed on location at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown, California. A painting used in the show as a backdrop to create illusions of greater depth perspectives is exhibited at the park.|$|E

5|$|Although Warner {{announced}} {{before the}} 1922 season {{that he was}} leaving to take the head-coaching position at Stanford, he honored his contract and remained at Pitt through 1923. The 1922 team had an 8–2 record, and the season ended with the Panthers taking their first cross-country train trip to defeat Stanford 16–7 in Palo Alto (coached by two Pitt assistants, sent ahead by Warner). Andrew Kerr became head coach at Stanford during Warner's last two years at Pitt. Warner's final season was his worst at Pitt, as the Panthers stumbled to a 5–4 record in 1923. However, <b>the</b> <b>Warner</b> era ended on a high note with a 20–3 victory over Penn State on November 29.|$|E
500|$|Ruegger modeled the Warners' personalities heavily {{after his}} three sons. Because <b>the</b> <b>Warners</b> were portrayed as cartoon stars {{from the early}} 1930s, Ruegger and other artists for Animaniacs made the images of <b>the</b> <b>Warners</b> similar to cartoon {{characters}} of the early 1930s. Simple black and white drawings were very common in cartoons of the 1920s and 1930s, such as Buddy, Felix the Cat, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and the early versions of Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse.|$|R
50|$|The movie premiered at <b>the</b> <b>Warner's</b> Earle Theater on August 12, 1943.It grossed $9,555,586.44 (equal to $ today), {{which was}} donated to Army Emergency Relief.|$|R

5|$|Brisco was {{developed}} by Boam and Cuse {{at the request of}} Fox executive Bob Greenblatt. Impressed by the duo's work on the script for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Greenblatt suggested they develop a series that bore the tone and style of vintage movie serials. The initial ideas and proposals from the show's writers were more often suited for film than television and had to be scaled down. Brisco {{was one of the last}} television shows to be filmed on <b>the</b> <b>Warner</b> Bros. Western backlot. Randy Edelman composed the distinctive theme music, which has been reused by the National Broadcasting Company during its coverage of the Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Film producer-director Elia Kazan hires James for {{the leading}} role in East of Eden (1955), marking his Hollywood debut.

5|$|In 1866, American {{soldiers}} established Camp Warner, {{a military}} camp near present-day Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge in Lake County. They were sent from Boise, Idaho, {{to build a}} military camp in the high desert, and built it east of <b>the</b> <b>Warner</b> Lakes, because they doubted that they could cross the series of wetlands. Maj. Gen. George Crook disapproved of the soldiers' decision. He built a road across the lakes and moved the camp to {{the western side of}} them.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Sam Warner of Warner Bros., then a small Hollywood {{studio with}} big ambitions, saw a {{demonstration}} of the Western Electric sound-on-disc system and was sufficiently impressed to persuade his brothers to agree to experiment with using this system at New York's Vitagraph Studios, which they had recently purchased. The tests were convincing to <b>the</b> <b>Warner</b> Brothers, if not to the executives of some other picture companies who witnessed them. Consequently, in April 1926 the Western Electric Company entered into a contract with Warner Brothers and W. J. Rich, a financier, giving them an exclusive license for recording and reproducing sound pictures under the Western Electric system. To exploit this license the Vitaphone Corporation was organized with Samuel L. Warner as its president.|$|E
5|$|In early 1991, two of Hollywood's largest sound stages (Stage 16 at Warner Bros. and Stage 12 at Universal Studios) {{were being}} {{prepared}} for the filming of Batman Returns. Filming started in June 1991. Stage 16 held Gotham Plaza, based on Rockefeller Center. Universal's Stage 12 housed Penguin's underground lair. A half-a-million gallon tank filled with water was used. Burton {{wanted to make sure}} that the penguins felt comfortable. Eight other locations on <b>the</b> <b>Warner</b> Bros. lot were used; over 50% of their property was occupied by Gotham City sets.|$|E
5|$|In syndication, {{the series}} was replayed on several {{television}} networks after its cancellation. USA Network ran the series beginning February 19, 1989, and until November 7, 1991. The United States' Cartoon Network began broadcasting it in 1994 and its sister channel Boomerang reran Help!... It's the Hair Bear Bunch! on several occasions in the early 2000s. A physical release on VHS first occurred in September 1988 and features three episodes from the series. Years later, as part of <b>the</b> <b>Warner</b> Bros.
