40|$|In {{the present}} study, to {{investigate}} into hydrogen combustion {{in an air}} flow, we registered the radiation intensity due to electron-excited ОН radicals in the wavelength range 280 - 340 nm [1 - 3]. We examined correlation- and autocorrelation spectra for the local pulsations of glow intensity and acoustic pulsations produced by the flame. The experimental scheme is shown in Fig. 1. Gaseous hydrogen was fed into injector (1), which was positioned in a vertically installed transparent quartz tube (2). The diameter of the injector hole was d = 1 mm. The rate of the hy-drogen flow was determined from the pressure drop across a hydroresistance included into the hydrogen supply system (3). To monitor the emission intensity due to ОН radicals, we used an optical system that contained a narrow-band optical filter (4), a quartz lens (5), and a photomul-tiplier (6) FEU- 39 A. The transmission factor of the quartz tube in the UV spectral region was no less than 90 %. The flame noise was measured by a piezoceramic sensing element (7) I 4310 that was located near {{the lower end of}} the quartz tube. Between the tube and the optical system, an opaque screen (8) was installed with a horizontal slot of 3 -mm height.

To one unacquainted with {{the character of the}} schooner, the proceedings of her crew must have seemed unaccountable as well as surprising. The carpenter and his assistants were slung over the sides of the vessel, upon which they plied their screwdrivers for a considerable time with great energy, but, apparently, with very little result. In the course of a quarter of an hour, however, a long narrow plank was loosened, which, when stripped off, discovered a narrow line of bright scarlet running quite round the vessel, {{a little more than a}} foot above the water-line. This having been accomplished, they next proceeded to the figurehead, and, unscrewing the white lady who smiled there, fixed in her place a hideous griffin's head, which, like the ribbon, was also bright scarlet. While these changes were being effected, others of the crew removed the boat that lay on the deck, bottom up, between the masts, and uncovered a long brass pivot-gun of the largest calibre, which shone in the saffron light of morning like a mass of burnished gold. This gun was kept scrupulously clean and neat in all its arrangements; the rammers, sponges, screws, and other apparatus belonging to it, were neatly arranged beside it, and four or five of its enormous iron shot were piled under its muzzle. The <b>traversing</b> <b>gear</b> connected with it was well greased, and, in short, everything about the gun gave proof of the care that was bestowed on it.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{problems}} of stability on very hard or soft ground became apparent with the Mk VI, {{leading to the}} recoil system not functioning correctly. A Commission went to France to investigate, and a special level [...] "Vickers platform" [...] was adopted, to which the wheels and trail were secured for accurate shooting. A major change {{in the line of}} shooting required the platform to be relaid. Setting up and adjusting the platform was labour-intensive. The US manual describes it:"The platform consists of wooden beams which assemble to form a triangular platform. The spade must be removed and a special bracket fitted on the trail when using this platform. This bracket travels in a groove which gives a bearing for the bracket and also provides a means of traversing the piece 52° on the platform. The main objects {{in the use of the}} firing platform are: To provide a reliable support for the wheels and rear end of the trail, so as to prevent sinking or movement when firing on soft ground; to ensure the gun remaining on the target when firing; and to provide means for shifting the trail transversely through an angle of 52° (26° each side of center). By using the <b>traversing</b> <b>gear</b> on the carriage a total traverse of 30° on each side of the center is obtainable... The carriage wheels rest on steel plates on the wheel platform and are guided by curved-steel angles which prevent lateral movement of the gun off the target when in action. When the firing platform is used, the float plate, with spade attached, which is bolted to the underside of the trail, is removed and another float plate, having a thrust bracket attached, is bolted in its place".|$|R

The tube was equipped with <b>traverse</b> <b>gear</b> to allow measurement of both temperature and velocity gradients across the outlet section.

Supplementary to the reactor, equipment was provided to meter and preheat the butane and oxygen.

The composition of the product stream from the reactor was correlated with the reaction variables of time, temperature, and inlet oxygen composition by means of a multiple regression analysis. Also, by the same technique, the degree of conversion of butane was studied on the basis of assumed rate equations. The reaction rate data for the n-butane oxidation were correlated on the basis of the following rate equation: [ [...] . ]. A minimum reaction rate for the oxidation of n-butane was observed at [ [...] . ]. The thermal decomposition data were found to correlate best on the basis of the following second order rate equation: [ [...] . ]. The application of the rate equations for the partial oxidation and the thermal decomposition of n-butane is restricted to the range of the experimental investigation, namely one atmosphere, 360 °- 760 °C and 0 - 25 % inlet oxygen concentration.
