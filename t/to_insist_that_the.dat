5|$|Under hypnosis, Scully {{recalls the}} Rebels burning her fellow abductees, {{as well as}} a Colonist {{spacecraft}} killing the Rebels and abducting Cassandra. During a meeting with Walter Skinner, Mulder continues <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> events have been orchestrated by the military and not by aliens. Meanwhile, the Russian vaccine seems to have no effect on Marita. The First Elder tells the Well-Manicured Man that they have already decided to turn the Rebel over to the Colonists. Jeffrey shows Scully a video of him talking about aliens while under hypnosis while he was a child, claiming his mother had forced him to make those statements.|$|E
5|$|Cardinal de Bernis {{entered the}} {{conclave}} {{at the end}} of March and took the leadership of the anti-Jesuit faction from the hands of Cardinal Orsini, who could have blocked Zelanti’s actions only with the great difficulties. Bernis immediately established a regular correspondence with French ambassador Marquis d'Aubeterre, which was in violation of the fundamental law of the conclave. Ambassadors of France and Spain urged Bernis <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> election of the future pope be made to depend on his written engagement to suppress the Jesuits. Bernis refused, answering that demanding from the future pope a written or oral promise to destroy the Society of Jesus would be in violation of the canon law. In spite of this refusal, during the next few weeks Bernis consecutively rejected all candidates proposed by Zelanti as too devoted to the Jesuits. In this way twenty-three out of twenty-eight papabile were eliminated, among them strongly pro-Jesuit Cardinal Fantuzzi, who at some point was very close to achieving election to the papal throne, as well as Cavalchini, Colonna, Stoppani, Pozzobonelli, Sersale, and several others.|$|E
5|$|In the fourth-season premiere, Ross and Rachel briefly {{reconcile}} after Ross {{pretends to}} read a long letter that Rachel wrote for him, but continues <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two were on a break so they break up again. Joey dates Kathy (Paget Brewster), a girl that Chandler has a crush on. Kathy and Chandler later kiss, which causes drama between Chandler and Joey. Joey forgives Chandler only after he spends a day in a box as punishment. Phoebe becomes a surrogate mother for her brother and his wife Alice (Debra Jo Rupp). Monica and Rachel are forced to switch apartments with Joey and Chandler after losing a bet during a quiz game, but manage to switch back by bribing them with Knicks season tickets and a one-minute kiss (off-screen) between the girls. Ross begins dating an English woman named Emily (Helen Baxendale), and the season finale features their wedding in London. Chandler and Monica sleep together, and Rachel decides to attend Ross and Emily's wedding. While saying his vows, Ross uses the wrong name at the altar (Rachel's), to the shock of his bride and the guests.|$|E

25|$|The government, therefore, while {{continuing}} <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> court's rulings were wrong, {{announced that it}} would accept them. The elections were held on 15 April 1953 with coloured voters in the Cape voting alongside white voters. Despite this, the National Party was returned in government with a larger majority: 94 seats out of 156, as opposed to 79 seats out of 153 in 1948.|$|E
25|$|The {{progress}} of the bill through Parliament was slow, {{partly because of the}} novelty of considering tube railway schemes; there were several petitions from the authorities responsible for public works in the city. The London County Council tried <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tubes should be made large enough to carry ordinary trains, and that all trains arriving at Waterloo should continue through them to the City. This idea would have required a new subterranean terminal station at the Bank of at least equal size to Waterloo itself.|$|E
25|$|A primary {{demand of}} the {{movement}} has been for decent, public housing and much of its work {{takes the form of}} opposing evictions. The movement has often used the phrase 'The Right to the City' <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> location of housing is critically important and demands that shack settlements are upgraded where they are and that people are not relocated to out of town developments. The movement rejects technocratic approaches to the housing crisis and stresses the need for dignity to be central to the resolution of the housing crisis. It is opposed to shack dwellers being moved into 'transit camps'.|$|E
5000|$|The {{feelings}} {{of friendship and}} respect between Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke were demonstrated by the so-called [...] "Clarke-Asimov Treaty of Park Avenue", put together as they shared a cab ride in New York. This stated that Asimov was required <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> Clarke was <b>the</b> best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> Asimov was <b>the</b> best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book Report on Planet Three (1972) reads: [...] "In accordance with {{the terms of the}} Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer." ...|$|R

It was, however, {{as much as possible}} concealed from observation; but, search lights being suddenly turned upon the forts, at night, showed them to be swarming with men.|$|R
25|$|After retirement, Parks {{wrote her}} {{autobiography}} and continued <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> struggle for justice was not over {{and there was}} more work to be done. In her final years, she suffered from dementia. Parks received national recognition, including the NAACP's 1979 Spingarn Medal, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and a posthumous statue in the United States Capitol's National Statuary Hall. Upon her death in 2005, she was the first woman and third non-US government official to lie in honor at the Capitol Rotunda. Her birthday, February 4, and the day she was arrested, December 1, have both become Rosa Parks Day, commemorated in California and Missouri (February 4), and Ohio and Oregon (December 1).|$|E

For the {{original}} game, despite production being based in Japan, Kamiya was particular <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character have an English voice actor, {{and had no}} Japanese voice actor assigned due to his belief that speaking Japanese would not suit the character. Tanaka first voiced the character in the anime , an adaptation of the original Bayonetta, and subsequently assumed the role in Bayonetta 2 and the re-release of the original title on Wii U. Tanaka also voiced the character in commercials for the original game in 2009. She was chosen {{due to the fact}} that her name kept cropping up when the team asked who could best portray the character in Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Tentative {{negotiations}} between Sinn Féin and the British government {{led to more}} substantive discussions with the SDLP in the 1990s. Multi-party negotiations began in 1994 in Northern Ireland, without Sinn Féin. The Provisional IRA declared a ceasefire {{in the autumn of}} 1994. Sinn Féin then joined the talks, but the Conservative government under John Major soon came to depend on unionist votes to remain in power. It suspended Sinn Féin from the talks, and began <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> IRA decommission all of their weapons before Sinn Féin be re-admitted to the talks; this led to the IRA calling off its ceasefire. The new Labour government of Tony Blair wasn't reliant on unionist votes and re-admitted Sinn Féin, leading to another, permanent, ceasefire.|$|E

Abu Talib was a descendant of Isma‘il ibn Ibrahim, and Shi‘ites believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> [...] "divine transmigration of the spirit" [...] is applied to ancestors as well as descendants. However, according to the Qur’an, Ibrahim's father Azar was an Idolator and Disbeliever.. Shia nonetheless believe Azar was Abraham's uncle, and the term for father was also used among Arabs for uncles.|$|R

25|$|On 20 March 2017 the Mirror {{painted the}} {{traditional}} Russian pancake celebration Maslenitsa as a Hooligan training ground. One of the centuries-old tradition in this Russian festival is “wall-to-wall” (‘’, Ru) which is sparring between men dressed in traditional folk clothes. This tradition was wrongly {{represented by the}} Mirror in the pictures and text, labeled as violent acts and living in fear without giving context or any information about this Russian traditional festival at all. The Mirror article was titled “Russia's Ultra yobs infiltrated amid warnings England fans could be KILLED at World Cup.”, and received negative receptions from Russian media and was also labeled as Fake news. The organizers of the traditional Russian folk festival event are looking to sue the Daily Mirror, it is reported later. Representatives of Daily Mirror acknowledged that the original material of the publication about Russian Hooligans was incorrectly illustrated with images of the traditional festival. In the updated version of the article the newspaper continues <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> photographed people were hooligans in the pictures, but gives no evidence of {{their participation in the}} festival.|$|E

500|$|Despite delays to his plan, Napoleon had pressed {{ahead with}} {{preparations}} for the Channel campaign: an army of 200,000 men was assembling at Boulogne for the invasion, and orders continued <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fleets under Villeneuve and Ganteaume put to sea. [...] Also ordered to sail was the squadron based at the Atlantic port of Rochefort, led by Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand. Allemand's squadron consisted of the powerful 120-gun ship Majestueux, three other ships {{of the line and}} several frigates and brigs, forming a significant force in its own right and a valuable addition to any battle fleet. Allemand was ordered to cruise off the southern coast of Cornwall, awaiting the combined fleets of Villeneuve and Ganteaume and their descent into the Channel. If this force did not materialise, Allemand was subsequently ordered to the Bay of Biscay to join up with Villeneuve on his route northwards and should this too fail then he was to conduct an extended commerce raiding operation in the Atlantic {{to take advantage of the}} concentration of British forces off Europe and the consequent exposure of British trade.|$|E
500|$|Morison and Gill had {{met with}} some {{resistance}} within Monotype while developing Perpetua and while Morison was an enthusiastic backer of the project, Monotype's engineering manager and type designer F.H. Pierpont was deeply unconvinced, commenting that he could [...] "see nothing in this design to recommend it and much that is objectionable". (Pierpont was the creator of Monotype's previous mainstay sans-serif, a loose family now called Monotype Grotesque. It is a much less sculptured design inspired by German sans-serifs.) Morison also intervened <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> letters [...] "J" [...] and [...] "Q" [...] be allowed to elegantly descend below the baseline, something not normal for titling typefaces which were often made to fill up the entire area of the metal type. In {{the early days of}} its existence it was not always consistently simply called [...] "Gill Sans", with other names such as [...] "Gill Sans-serif", [...] "Monotype Sans-Serif" [...] (the latter two both used by Gill in some of his publications) or its order numbers (such as Series No. 231) sometimes used.|$|E

5000|$|The openly homoerotic {{nature of}} the poetry {{has been a source}} of {{discomfort}} to later generations. Michelangelo's grandnephew, Michelangelo Buonarroti the Younger, published the poems in 1623 with the gender of pronouns changed, and it was not until John Addington Symonds translated them into English in 1893 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> original genders were restored.

50|$|Eventually the Ptolemaic-Aristotelian {{system was}} {{challenged}} and pluralism reasserted, first tentatively by scholastics {{and then more}} seriously by followers of Copernicus. The telescope appeared to prove that a multitude of life was reasonable and an expression of God's creative omnipotence; still powerful theological opponents, meanwhile, continued <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> although <b>the</b> Earth may have been displaced {{from the center of}} the cosmos, it was still the unique focus of God's creation.

500|$|Garrow also {{influenced}} {{the rules of}} evidence, which were only just beginning to evolve when he started his career. His insistence that hearsay and copied documents could not be admitted in evidence led to the best evidence rule. He was crucial in insisting on the autonomy of lawyers when inducting evidence, in one case openly arguing with the trial judge <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> advocates have independence in submitting it. During this period, the use of partisan medical experts was particularly problematic. While medical experts were regularly called at the Old Bailey, the use of partisan experts was resisted, and at the beginning experts were given limited authority. While this increased {{towards the end of}} the 17th century, in line with the judges' increasing desire for certainty and facts, Garrow is noted as an excellent example of the attitude lawyers took when cross-examining such witnesses. When defending Robert Clark, accused of killing John Delew by kicking him in the stomach, Garrow used a mixture of aggressive cross-examination and medical knowledge to get the prosecution's medical expert to admit that he could not prove how Delew had died. Garrow and later advocates learned how to effectively [...] "interrogate" [...] such witnesses, strengthening their own arguments (when it was their expert) or demolishing those of others (when it was an expert attached to the other side).|$|E
500|$|Jay was {{instructed}} by Alexander Hamilton to seek compensation for seizure of American ships and {{to clarify the}} rules governing British seizure of neutral ships. He was also <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British relinquish their posts in the Northwest. In return, the U.S. would take responsibility for pre-Revolution debts owed to British merchants and subjects. He also asked Jay, if possible, to seek limited access for American ships to the British West Indies. Jay and the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Grenville, began negotiations on July 30, 1794. The treaty that emerged several weeks later, {{commonly known as the}} Jay Treaty, was, in Jay's words [...] "equal and fair." [...] Both sides achieved many objectives; several issues were sent to arbitration. For the British, America remained neutral and economically grew closer to Britain. The Americans also guaranteed favorable treatment to British imports. In return, the British agreed to evacuate the western forts, which they had been supposed to do by 1783. They also agreed to open their West Indies ports to smaller American ships, allow small vessels to trade with the French West Indies, and set up a commission that would adjudicate American claims against Britain for seized ships, and British claims against Americans for debts incurred before 1775. However, the treaty contained neither concessions on impressment nor statement of rights for American sailors. Another commission was later established to settle boundary issues.|$|E
500|$|On 1 October 1941, Dangić and {{two other}} east Bosnian Chetnik commanders, Pero Đukanović and Sergije Mihailović, met with the Partisan General Staff for Bosnia-Hercegovina at the village of Drinjača south of Zvornik. The Partisans were Svetozar Vukmanović (known as [...] "Tempo"), Rodoljub Čolaković and Princip-Seljo. The meeting agreed on the {{creation}} of a joint Chetnik-Partisan Staff, the [...] "Command of the Bosnian Military and Partisan Detachments", to consist of six members, three Chetniks and three Partisans. The meeting also agreed that joint Chetnik-Partisan administration would be imposed on liberated areas, using the Partisan model of people's liberation committees. The resulting declaration was a compromise, and called on the patriotism of both Serbs and Bosnians, although Dangić opposed the inclusion of any call for the unity of Muslims or Croats with the Serbs of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as he stated that all Muslims were responsible for the Ustaše crimes against Serbs. According to Hoare, the Drinjača agreement represented the pinnacle of co-operation between Partisans and Chetniks in east Bosnia, but effectively sidelined the Provincial Committee. On 6 October, a further meeting was held at Milići near Vlasenica, and the composition of the joint staff was decided. Dangić, Babić and Sergije Mihailović became the Chetnik representatives, and Vukmanović, Čolaković and Princip-Seljo represented the Partisans, with Sergije Mihailović appointed as chief of staff. After the war, the Drinjača agreement was the subject of much heated debate between Vukmanović and Čolaković, with Vukmanović blaming Čolaković for the negative medium-term consequences of the agreement for the Partisan movement in east Bosnia. According to Vukmanović, these consequences included the virtual disappearance of an independent Partisan General Staff for Bosnia-Herzegovina, the domination of the joint staff by Sergije Mihailović, including his appointment of officers hostile to the Partisans as commanders of Partisan units, the diversion of weapons from the Partisan controlled arms factory at Užice to Chetnik troops, and the alienation of the Muslim and Croat population of the region. When Vukmanović raised his concerns with Tito, the Bosnian Communists were forced <b>to</b> <b>insist</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> joint staff could have no contact with Chetnik units except during operations against Axis forces, and no joint Chetnik-Partisan operations would be permitted in Muslim areas.|$|E
