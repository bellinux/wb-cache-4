40|$|Abstract Recently in Korea, {{the policy}} is being {{proceeded}} to build a intergenerational housing on artificial ground of railroad site for utilizing rental house. Due to narrow space of rail road site, suitable method have to be developed such as micropiles which {{is known as a}} method of a fast construction. However, If micropile is used as foundations for the super structure, construction cost is increases compared with other pile. Consequently, new concept micropile proposed to improve both bearing capacity and cost efficiency of general micropile. New concept micropile consists of waveform cement grout surrounding <b>tread</b> <b>bar</b> that formed by grouting the soil layer with jet grouting method as control the grout pressure and flow. The micropile with waveform is expected to decrease the construction cost by cut down pile length of general micropile. This pape...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} between soil and tractor tires through a 2 D numerical model. The tire is schematized as a rigid ring presenting a series of rigid <b>tread</b> <b>bars</b> on the external circumference. The outer profile of the tire is divided {{into a series of}} elements, each one able to exchange a normal and a tangential contact force with the ground. A 2 D soil model was developed to compute the forces at the ground-tire interface: the normal force is determined {{on the basis of the}} compression of the soil generated by the sinking of the tire. The soil is modeled through a layer of springs characterized by two different stiffness for the loading (lower stiffness) and unloading (higher stiffness) condition. This scheme allows to introduce a memory effect on the soil which results stiffer and keeps a residual sinking after the passage of the tire. The normal contact force determines the maximum value of tangential force provided before the soil fails. Two different soil responses were considered: a perfect plastic one and a perfect fragile one. In the first case, once the maximum tangential force is reached, its value is kept constant until the soil's element is no longer in contact with the tire (i. e. the normal contact forces drops to zero); in the second case, at the maximum value of the tangential force the soil's particle fails and the tangential force decreases to zero. Data required to characterize the soil response were determined on the basis of technical literature and of outdoor experimental tests. The numerical model was used to estimate the traction force vs. slip curves, developed by two tires with different size and <b>tread</b> <b>bars</b> scheme; numerical results were compared to the output of corresponding experimental tests...|$|R
50|$|The first {{deliberate}} use bar grip tyres as off-road tyres, {{were developed}} pre-war as truck tyres particularly for army use. They used crosswise <b>tread</b> <b>bars</b> for grip. {{arranged in a}} helical pattern. A helical pattern was used to avoid the uneven rolling radius and vibration of a tread with simple crosswise bars and large gaps between. This helical pattern also {{gave rise to a}} sideways force, particularly on tarmac. As all tyres had the same 'hand', this force increased across {{the two sides of the}} vehicle. To counteract this force, the central stop-rib was added. The stop-rib was only partly successful though; snowy conditions led the Swiss Post Office to use left- and right-handed tyres to balance the force across the vehicle. Later developments would use balanced arrangements of ribs in a chevron or herringbone layout. The more common arrangement for the later low-speed military bar grip was to use straight bars, but relying on the centre rib to avoid their vibration problems on tarmac.|$|R

She was looking for something--she didn't know what; and she never could rest now until she'd found it.|$|R
5|$|Nokian Tyres {{manufactures}} {{truck and}} bus tyres sold under the Nokian Hakkapeliitta brand. Steer, traction, and trailer tyres are marketed. Nokian Heavy Tyres Ltd is {{a manufacturer of}} special tyres for forestry, industrial machinery, and agriculture. Its products are sold as original equipment as well on the replacement tyre market. Nokian Tyres produces a number of product lines, including the Tractor Industrial 2 and Country King. Nokian Tyres is a world market leader in forestry tyres, which are a key product of the Nokian Heavy Tyres subsidiary. Nokian forestry tyres include the Skidder and Cut-To-Length model lines. The Skidder tyres have a 25 degree bar angle and the Cut-To-Length tyres have a 35 degree bar angle. Bar angle is a tyre <b>tread</b> measurement. Smaller <b>bar</b> angles are associated with higher traction {{at the expense of}} increased mud accumulation.|$|R
