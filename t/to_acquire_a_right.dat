5000|$|The next {{problem of}} {{allegiance}} is who {{exactly is the}} rightful ruler? And according to Hume, such questions are often irresolvable by reason, {{and it can be}} wise to simply go with the flow in the [...] "interests of peace and liberty". Again, Hume agrees that political society begins with a social agreement promising allegiance to certain people. But once a government acquires its own authority by serving the public interest, it is (paradoxically) in our interest to renounce our interest and simply abide the powers that be, lest we fall into divisive controversies over the best possible ruler. Questions of succession are then answered with five somewhat arbitrary principles: (1) long possession: the influence of custom favors long-established forms of governments, though it takes longer <b>to</b> <b>acquire</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> to large nations; (2) present possession: few governments have any better claim to authority than successfully holding onto power; (3) conquest: we favor glorious conquerors over detestable usurpers; (4) succession: along with the clear advantages of hereditary government, Hume emphasizes our imaginative tendency to associate parents with children and pass belongings from one to the other; (5) positive laws: lawmakers may change the form of government, though any drastic departures from tradition are apt to diminish popular allegiance. And with so many distinct principles, the choice of ruler is sometimes wonderfully clear, and sometimes hopelessly unclear. In a closing discussion of the Glorious Revolution, Hume defends keeping the right of resistance unformulated and out of the legal code, and extending this right from cases of direct oppression to cases of interbranch constitutional encroachment in [...] "mix'd governments", adding two [...] "philosophical reflections": first, Parliament's authority to exclude the heirs of rulers they have deposed, but not the heirs of rulers who simply died, derives from mere imaginative inertia; second, a contested change in authority may acquire legitimacy retroactively from a stable line of successors.|$|E
40|$|Is it {{possible}} in Hong Kong <b>to</b> <b>acquire</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> of way by long, open and uninterrupted usage? One {{might have expected}} this question, fundamental and of practical importance, to have been settled authoritatively. The answer has instead divided Hong Kong's judges. Although the weight of recent opinion {{seems to be in}} favour of allowing such a right, the basis of doing so is not at all clear. It will be the gravamen of this article that the courts should no longer entertain any doubts upon the matter. Acquisition of such rights by usage is possible. The basis for recognition of such rights will be suggested and is, perhaps surprisingly, straightforward, {{but it is not the}} basis that has sometimes been suggested. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

60|$|Rob Roy MacGregor Campbell, {{which last}} name he bore in {{consequence}} of the Acts of Parliament abolishing his own, was the younger son of Donald MacGregor of Glengyle, {{said to have been}} a Lieutenant-Colonel (probably in the service of James II.), by his wife, a daughter of Campbell of Glenfalloch. Rob's own designation was of Inversnaid; but he appears <b>to</b> have <b>acquired</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> of some kind or other to the property or possession of Craig Royston, a domain of rock and forest, lying {{on the east side of}} Loch Lomond, where that beautiful lake stretches into the dusky mountains of Glenfalloch.|$|R
5000|$|The paper {{describes}} how Malewicki had built and driven a freeway-legal 154-MPG car in 1981, but realized {{it could never}} be safe on a street surrounded by far larger and heavier vehicles. Elevated tracks would allow a very light vehicle to be safe. They are also basic to the system's inexpensiveness, {{because there is no}} need <b>to</b> <b>acquire</b> <b>a</b> huge <b>right</b> of way and tear down buildings. It presents an aerodynamic analysis (Malewicki is an aerospace engineer) supporting claims of very high energy efficiency (the paper claims 407 mpg for SkyTran's current two-passenger tandem design, though the Unimodal site claims only, [...] "over 200 mpg"). [...] It also described how a very light vehicle that can squeeze both surfaces of a track simultaneously could reliably achieve a 6-G deceleration, allowing it to brake safely to a stop from 100 mph in just 55 ft.|$|R
40|$|Having a birth {{certificate}} is <b>a</b> stepping stone <b>to</b> <b>acquiring</b> <b>an</b> array of <b>rights</b> and benefits, including other documents necessary to navigate {{in and outside}} of one's home country.

This working paper examines some of the crucial causes and consequences of not acquiring this key document. It also underscores what governments can do, if political will exists, to facilitate the process of birth registration and certification among citizens...|$|R
2500|$|There {{were two}} other main {{potential}} interpretations of section 41, {{both of which}} suggested that the section was only ever {{intended to be a}} transitional provision, to preserve the status quo until the Parliament of Australia could pass its own laws about elections and voting. The first interpretation was that section 41 only applied to people who were already entitled to vote when the Constitution of Australia came into effect, an argument first advanced by William Harrison Moore. The second argument was that it could apply <b>to</b> people who <b>acquired</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> after the Constitution came into effect, but only if they acquired that right {{on the basis of a}} state law which was in force before the Constitution came into effect, an argument put forward by John Quick and Robert Garran. The four people argued that neither of these interpretations should apply, because section 41 was not a transitional provision. They argued that if it were, it would have been worded like other transitional provisions, including the usual phrase [...] "until Parliament otherwise provides".|$|R
