40|$|Objective: To measure serum {{levels of}} {{immunoglobulin}} A byimmunoenzymatic assay (ELISA) in {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus (DM- 1) patients and to verify the prevalence of immunoglobulin A deficiency(IgAD) in diabetic patients. Methods: The serum immunoglobulin Alevel was determined in 149 DM- 1 patients by three methods. IgADwas defined as serum immunoglobulin A level lower than 5 mg/dl. If serum immunoglobulin A level was undetectable by turbidimetry,radial immunodiffusion was performed in low plate concentration. For patients with undetectable serum immunoglobulin A levelby the two previous methods, quantification was performed byELISA. In patients with IgAD, the levels of immunoglobulins Gand M were measured by <b>turbidimetry</b> to exclude other humoralimmunodeficiencies. Results: Out of 149 DM- 1 patients evaluated, 141 (94. 6 %) had normal serum immunoglobulin A levels byturbidimetry. Eight patients (5. 3 %) had undetectable serumimmunoglobulin A levels by <b>turbidimetry</b> and radial immunodiffusion. In these eight patients, the determination of serum immunoglobulinA was performed by ELISA, a more sensitive method. Very lowlevels of serum immunoglobulin A were detected in these diabeticpatients.

This polymer exhibits lower critical solution temperature (LCST) owing to its PNIPAAm block. Increasing the ionic strength of the aqueous solutions leads to {{a decrease in the}} cloud point (CP) of the solutions which is an indication of enhanced aggregation due to the screening of Coulomb repulsions. The dynamic light scattering (DLS) data gives a detailed information about the interactions between intra-chain and inter-chain associations.

The effect of ionic strength induced by adding different amounts of NaCl on solutions of the applied triblock terpolymer has been examined by means of <b>turbidimetry,</b> dynamic light scattering, densitometry and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). By increasing the amount of added salt, the electrostatic interactions are screened out and increasing the temperature promotes the formation of large aggregates.
