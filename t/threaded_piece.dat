40|$|It is {{established}} {{that at the}} present moment the roller screws (RS) are the most challenging mechanical transducers of rotational motion into forward motion. For that reason their field of application is being constantly enlarged. In the West one can observe the tendency of the replacement of hydraulic drive by RS-based electromechanical drive. The main RS parts are screw, thread rollers and female screw which on the load transmission interact in the contact lands located on the pitch diameters of the special thread of these parts. To exclude the edge contacts on the male screw and female screw the thread with triangular profile waps are performed, on the rollers – with convex profile. Besides the pitch diameters of the male screw, rollers and female screw thread form the closed-loop dimension chain, and the values of these diameters affect the RS axial play and its performance capabilities significantly. Therefrom in manufacturing <b>thread</b> <b>pieces</b> it is required {{to carry out the}} high-precision control of their thread pitch diameters. For the male thread this control is carried out by means of three cylindrical wires with preferred diameter.

Anna’s daughter Crystal returns {{home from school and}} runs upstairs to listen to Little Richard. Jeanette spends two weeks studying Anna Thunder; at the same time, Crystal becomes withdrawn from her mother. Spring arrives as Anna sits on the porch singing a Dakota song when tribal officer Calvin Wind Soldier arrives with a naked Jeanette with a towel around her and clutching her shoes. Jeanette had traveled to Herod Small War’s place to sneak into a sweat with Archie Iron Necklace and Bill Good Voice Elk. They kicked her out and Herod’s assistant called Calvin to take her away. Anna and Jeanette attend the carnival, see Calvin with his wife and her sister before running into Chester Brush Horns. He asks for cigarettes so Anna purchases them and then buys two tickets to ride the Ferris wheel where their car becomes stuck at the top. Chester entertains Anna at her request through acrobatics in the car. When Anna awakes the next morning, Chester gathers his clothing and leaves the house smoke-filled with Jeanette making breakfast. Anna tells Jeanette that she has a plan to correct a past wrong and falls asleep on the floor. She dreams of telling Calvin that they are to be together when Herod appears and tells her of an enchanted belt, which will not let her pass. Frustrated, Anna returns to her body from her dream and wakes up to discover Crystal was holding her and had thought she died.

40|$|Today roller-screw {{mechanisms}} (RSM) are {{the most}} prospective motion converters from rotary to linear type. RSM manufacturers have suggested their design in the way, similar to the rolling bearings, in static and dynamic load ratings. The latter means that during long operations the main criterion of the RSM working capacity is fatigue spalling. However, this approach does not permit to consider temporal changes {{of the most critical}} performance parameters of the RSM (such as the axial play, the efficiency factor, the axial stiffness, the accuracy, the starting torque force for zero lash RSMs, etc.) through calculations. The abovementioned method was not perfect, because the choice of the main criterion of RSM working capacity was wrong. The article proves that wear-resistance is the main criterion of RSM working capacity. The proof is the RSM efficiency factor equal to 80 - 88 % on the average. The power loss occurs because of overcoming a sliding friction between multiple (from 300 to 1000) interfacing turns of thread on the screw and the rollers {{as well as on the}} rollers and the nut. That is why the RSMs are the screwtype rolling mechanisms with an essential portion of sliding friction. High-accuracy measurements taken using the device called a form-tracer for <b>threaded</b> <b>pieces</b> permitted to determine the essential changes on the profiles of turns of threads on the rollers (a straight-line portion appeared on the radial profile); these changes could emerge only from wear. Besides, the length of this portion increased with the increasing RSM operation time. The JSC “Moskvich” has examined the RSMs, which have been put out of operation after completing their service life as parts of robot welding machines. There were no traces of fatigue spalling found on the threaded surfaces of the RSM parts, while the sizes of the straight-line portions on the turns of the roller threads were much bigger than they were during the measurements after the initial period of operation. Therefore, it is relevant to conduct a research for developing the RSM wear-resistance calculation methods. The aim and objectives of such a research have been established, and the initial object – a non-nut type roller-screw mechanism of simple design and kinematics – has been chosen. By now a whole range of theoretical studies have been conducted entirely, or partially, a test rig has been designed and manufactured, and the metrological examination methods have been developed for threaded surfaces of the RSM parts...|$|R

40|$|I. Introduction The {{subject of}} {{research}} in this work {{is a process of}} thread unrolling from a bobbin. The mathematical model of this process considering motion of thread peace on a bobbin and unrolled peace is proposed. The dimension of system of differential equations for this model is constant during deploying. The relevance to simulate this process for design of Heliogyro-like solar sails (Heliogyro [1], BMSTU-Sail [2]) is proved. The paper briefly characterizes a blade for such solar sail as a simulation object. It proves the possibility for using a flexible thread model for a long blade because of very small blade thickness (less than 10 μm [3]) relative to blade width and the phenomena of Koriolis forces [4] that lead to buckling failure of blade flatness. The major features of the proposed model are: [...] simulated as a motion of the <b>thread</b> <b>piece</b> both being on a bobbin and its unrolled peace; [...] splitting a thread length into nodes does not depend on the demand to ensure a sufficient number of nodes on a single thread turn on the coil; [...] because of avoiding a problem of contact between the thread and bobbin a stable integration of motion equations is provided by the conventional Runge-Kutta method of fourth order with a constant step [5]; [...] in the course of solution the number of freedom degrees (number of motion equation) is constant, thereby simplifying a calculation algorithm. The closest mathematical model is proposed in [6]. The scientific novelty of this research is the approach to solving the problem of unrolling thread from a bobbin using a constant number of motion equations while preserving real kinematics coiling process. II. Problem formulation In this section the problem of unrolling thread with length L from a bobbin of radius r is posed while any kind of forces are acting on the unrolled peace of thread. Moreover, the law of bobbin rotation φ(t) assumed to be known with the proviso that the model can be modified if φ(t) is the result of solving of ordinary differential equation. III. Mathematical model In this section the detailed description of proposed mathematical model based on conventional spring-mass model is given. The major feature of this model is that on the every integration step all nodes divided into three groups:  nodes on the bobbin (linked) – their motion is completely determined by the bobbin rotation;  free nodes – descended from the bobbin and not neighboring nodes on the bobbin;  boundary nodes - descended from the bobbin neighboring nodes on the bobbin. For each nodes group the right parts of equations of motions are different. In these equations the additional corrections are included that result in reducing the impact of discretization on simulation results. These corrections are:  equations of motion for boundary nodes eliminate unphysical reaction components, resulting from discretization;  when a node descends from the bobbin its velocity vector turns following motion of already descended nodes, thus simulating the thread bending of very small radius at the point of thread descending. IV. Numerical experiment The developed mathematical model is tested using the simplified problem of two-blades rotary solar sail deploying from the «BMSTU-Sail» project [2]. The calculations demonstrated that the proposed mathematical model satisfies the law of conservation of angular momentum. It is also shown that calculation results are almost independent on the utility parameters of mathematical model (e. g. damping coefficient of nodes relative oscillations). V. Conclusion Major conclusions in this paper are:  proposed mathematical model satisfies the law of conservation of angular momentum that indirectly confirms its correctness;  the transverse thread motion is almost independent on the damping and stiffness coefficients, therefore they can be adjusted for calculation stability without accuracy loss;  based on proposed mathematical model of unrolling a thread from a bobbin the improved model of unrolling from a bobbin ought to be developed for more accurate calculations of solar sail deploying. </p...|$|R
