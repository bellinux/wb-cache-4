5|$|According to some sources, Lincoln's first romantic {{interest}} was Ann Rutledge, {{whom he met}} when he first moved to New Salem; these sources indicate that by 1835, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> relationship but not formally engaged. She {{died at the age}} of 22 on August 25, 1835, most likely of typhoid fever. In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Norberto Fontana {{claimed in}} an {{interview}} with the Argentinian newspaper Olé that a few hours before the Grand Prix the Ferrari team director Jean Todt visited the Sauber motorhome and told the Swiss team, which used Ferrari engines at the time, that the Saubers must block Jacques Villeneuve if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to do so in order to help Michael Schumacher win the World Championship.|$|E
5|$|During World War I {{the track}} and rolling stock {{received}} little maintenance, {{and by the end}} of the war <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> piteous state, while expenses had increased dramatically. The problem became a crisis after the serious fire at the Trianon depot on 30 November 1921, which destroyed 70 of the 155 trams of the CTR. Successive fare rises provided a stopgap, but with the new convention of 29 December 1923 the company announced a reorganisation of the network. A competitor had also arrived: the bus. Trams had always attracted criticism over their limited capacity, slowness and discomfort, and their encumbrance to motor cars in the city centre. Another accident on the Monumental line on 5 October 1925 hastened the inevitable: the trams lost their first route.|$|E

5|$|Gil González Dávila set {{out from}} the Caribbean island of Hispaniola early in 1524, with the {{intention}} of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course took him to the north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.|$|E
5|$|In early 1971, Deacon was {{introduced}} to Taylor and May by a friend at a disco who told him that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> band that had just lost its bassist. A {{couple of days later}} he auditioned in a lecture room at Imperial College London and became the last member of Queen to join. Since the band's last bassist drew attention away from Mercury, Deacon was selected for his musical talent, his quiet demeanour and his electrical skills. A persistent legend claims Deacon was the seventh bassist auditioned, but more recent sources show Queen's bassists were, in order: Mike Grose, Barry Mitchell, Doug Bogie and Deacon. Deacon played his first show with Queen at the College of Estate Management in Kensington in June.|$|E
5|$|Inexplicably, Generals Floyd and Pillow were upbeat {{about the}} day's {{performance}} and wired General Johnston at Nashville {{that they had}} won a great victory. Buckner, however, argued that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> desperate position that was getting worse {{with the arrival of}} Union reinforcements. At their final council of war in the Dover Hotel at 1:30a.m. on February 16, Buckner stated that if C.F. Smith attacked again, he could only hold for thirty minutes, and he estimated that the cost of defending the fort would be as high as a seventy-five percent casualty rate. Buckner's position finally carried the meeting. Any large-scale escape would be difficult. Most of the river transports were currently transporting wounded men to Nashville and would not return in time to evacuate the command.|$|E

5|$|Life for the blue-collar men of {{the port}} is {{increasingly}} hard and work is scarce. As union leader, Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives. Lacking the funds needed {{for this kind of}} influence, Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling ring. Around him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few other opportunities to earn money. It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> container {{that was supposed to be}} smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards The Greek, the mysterious man in charge. But Valchek, upset that their focus has moved beyond Sobotka, gets the FBI involved. The Greek has a mole inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Megaloceros or Irish Elk is {{a species}} from the Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs in Eurasia. Hawkins built a family unit of male, female and fawn; the adult male bore antlers made from actual fossil antlers, long since replaced. Moved {{from the third}} island, they had fallen into {{disrepair}} as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> place easily accessible by vandals. With their original but fragile antlers, the Irish Elks were the most accurate of the models; since they are of recent geological age (dying out 11,000 years ago), Hawkins was able to model them on living deer.|$|E
5|$|The Alexandrian texts were {{incorporated}} {{into the body of}} classical Greek literature that was preserved, catalogued and studied by scholars of the Hellenistic period. From then until the fourth centuryAD, copies of his orations multiplied and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> relatively good position to survive the tense period from the sixth until the ninth centuryAD. In the end, sixty-one orations attributed to Demosthenes survived till the present day (some however are pseudonymous). Friedrich Blass, a German classical scholar, believes that nine more speeches were recorded by the orator, but they are not extant. Modern editions of these speeches are based on four manuscripts of the tenth and eleventh centuriesAD.|$|E

5|$|The {{detachment}} in Florida, {{which had}} grown to about 400 men, was paid off and disbanded when the British post was evacuated {{at the end of}} the war. A small number of men went to Bermuda with the British as part of a refugee group, rejoining the main body of Colonial Marines. Others from the Florida unit remained in settlements around the wooden stockade, which had become a symbol of slave insurrection. Andrew Jackson opposed the presence of a group of armed fugitive slaves (although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sparsely-populated area of Spanish Florida); this led to the Battle of Negro Fort in July 1816 and the beginning of the First Seminole War. For their involvement in the conflict, two former auxiliary officers of the corps were executed in 1818 in what became known as the Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident. It is believed that former Colonial Marine refugees were among a group that escaped to the Bahamas in 1822 and founded, on the west coast of the island of Andros, a community that retains its identity to the present day.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of 'B' Company regrouped at Deniki, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bad state and when on 4 August, Major Allan Cameron, brigade major of the 30th Brigade, arrived to take command of Maroubra Force, {{most of them}} were sent back to Isurava in disgrace as he was under the mistaken belief that they had run away from the fighting. Nevertheless, on 8 August the rest of the 39th Battalion, now without the only troops who had any experience fighting the Japanese, launched a counterattack at Kokoda. They managed to secure one side of the airfield, but due to the close proximity of the Japanese on the other side, relief aircraft were unable to land and short of food and ammunition, they were forced to fall back to Deniki once again after almost two days of fighting. They eventually managed to halt the Japanese advance and on 14 August Maroubra Force fell back to Isurava.|$|E
5|$|Tromp on Christianus Quintus, Vice Admiral Jens Rodsten on Tre Løver and Niels Juel on Churprindsen took {{advantage}} of the chaos. They quickly surrounded Svärdet and three supporting ships (Hieronymus, Neptunus and Järnvågen, an armed merchantman) and began to hammer them into submission. Several other Swedish vessels attempted to assist Uggla, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lee position and could not provide effective support. After about an hour-and-a-half to two hours of hard fighting Svärdets mainmast went overboard and Uggla had to surrender to Tromp. Despite this, Svärdet was ignited by accident or misunderstanding by the Dutch fireship t Hoen. The second largest Swedish ship after Kronan sank in the blaze and took with it 600 out of a crew of 650, including Admiral Uggla himself. Only Hieronymus escaped the assault by the allied admirals, though badly damaged, and the others were captured by Juel on Churprindsen together with one of his lieutenants on Anna Sophia.|$|E

5|$|Yellow Fever and How to Cure It was {{a three-part}} story by Robert Holmes {{that would have}} taken place in Singapore and {{featured}} the Autons as the monsters, with both the Rani and the Master appearing, the Brigadier would have also returned. The first episode was commissioned on 26 October 1984, before being put on hold. The entire story was subsequently commissioned on 6 February 1985, only {{a couple of weeks before}} news of the planned hiatus broke. Nathan-Turner hoped to have Graeme Harper direct the adventure. After the news of the hiatus, Holmes was asked by the production team to continue with the story but as six 25 minute episodes, this version seeing the removal of the Master from the plot. Holmes reportedly only completed a story outline before the planned Season 23 was completely cancelled. The basic premise had the Master and the Rani operating under the guise of a travelling street theatre, the story would open with Peri seeing the Statue of Liberty on the scanner screen, and she would think she was back in America, only to find <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> massive cultural garden with many miniature landmarks on display.|$|E
