[...] Its <b>tax</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> is 87-0495235. [...] According to Silverstein, its annual budget for all of its staff and office expenditures is significantly lower than the median compensation for business chief executive officers (CEOs) alone. Board members receive no compensation and are not reimbursed for the costs of attending board meetings. [...] Unlike other environmental groups, Seacology does not offer memberships, which further reduces its expenditures. Staff answer the phone instead of using automated answering services, and Seacology respects donor privacy and is compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).|$|E
2500|$|Effective from May 2006 (May 2007 {{for small}} health plans), all covered {{entities}} using electronic communications (e.g., physicians, hospitals, health insurance companies, and so forth) must use a single new NPI. The NPI replaces all other identifiers used by health plans, Medicare, Medicaid, {{and other government}} programs. However, the NPI does not replace a provider's DEA number, state license number, or <b>tax</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number.</b> The NPI is 10 digits (may be alphanumeric), with the last digit being a checksum. The NPI cannot contain any embedded intelligence; in other words, the NPI is simply a number that does not itself have any additional meaning. The NPI is unique and national, never re-used, and except for institutions, a provider usually can have only one. An institution may obtain multiple NPIs for different [...] "sub-parts" [...] such as a free-standing cancer center or rehab facility.|$|E

At the time of order and pending determination of the FMV, Amazon estimates what the FMV will be at the time ownership transfers.

5000|$|The {{system can}} be used even if the {{property}} is not legally described by the Block and Lot system. A property legally described by a metes and bounds description may still be assigned a <b>Tax</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number</b> based on a separate Lot and Block system. In this case, a survey of all parcels in the county or municipality would be combined to create a separate Block and Lot system to identify the properties for taxation purposes. For example, a metes and bounds described parcel may be assigned the <b>Tax</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number</b> 14-55-118, which {{has nothing to do}} with the legal description of the property recorded in the deed other than its use to create the tax Block and Lot maps. In this case, the first number may be used to indicate the local municipality, the second number indicates the tax map on which the property is recorded, and the third number is the parcel identification number on the indicated map. A similar system might be <b>Tax</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Number</b> 205-K-33 where [...] "205" [...] is the map book volume number, [...] "K" [...] is the individual map, and [...] "33" [...] is a parcel number.|$|E

[...] Of the 82 NGOs implementing those projects, ten are linked to Napoles. [...] The report also elaborates on [...] "questionable" [...] transactions made using the PDAF: ₱1.054 billion went to NGOs which were either unregistered, used multiple <b>Tax</b> <b>Identification</b> <b>Numbers</b> (TIN), or issued questionable receipts; while ₱1.289 billion in PDAF disbursements spent were not compliant with the Government Procurement Reform Act of 2003. Lawmakers from across the political spectrum, both past and present, were cited in the report, some of whom (such as Edgardo Angara, Ruffy Biazon, Neptali Gonzales II and Niel Tupas, Jr.) are closely related to President Aquino.
