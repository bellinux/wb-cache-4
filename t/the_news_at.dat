The decision followed Elliott's return to the Blues, as Brodeur had been demoted to the team's number three goalie behind Elliott and Jake Allen. Brodeur announced <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>at</b> a press conference two days later. He retired having started just five games with the Blues, going 3–3–0 in seven appearances.

In the subsequent contest of 1876, Hayes was elected after a contentious compromise over disputed electoral votes. The results of the convention had further effects on Blaine’s political career, as Bristow, having lost the nomination, also resigned as Treasury Secretary {{three days after the}} convention ended. President Grant selected Senator Lot M. Morrill of Maine to fill the cabinet post, and Maine’s governor, Seldon Connor, appointed Blaine to the now-vacant Senate seat. When the Maine Legislature reconvened that autumn, they confirmed Blaine’s appointment and elected him to the full six-year term that would begin on March 4, 1877.|$|E

Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker said [...] "I think it's dreadful of the Americans to have done it.

500|$|Blur {{began working}} on their fourth album The Great Escape {{at the start of}} 1995. Building upon the band's {{previous}} two albums, Albarn's lyrics for the album consisted of several third-person narratives. James reflected, [...] "It was all more elaborate, more orchestral, more theatrical, and the lyrics were even more twisted ... It was all dysfunctional, misfit characters fucking up." [...] The release of the album's lead single [...] "Country House" [...] played a part in Blur's public rivalry with Manchester band Oasis termed the [...] "Battle of Britpop". Partly due to increasing antagonisms between the groups, Blur and Oasis ultimately decided to release their new singles on the same day, an event the NME called [...] "The British Heavyweight Championship". The debate over which band would top the British singles chart became a media phenomenon, and Albarn appeared on <b>the</b> <b>News</b> <b>at</b> Ten. At the end of the week, [...] "Country House" [...] ultimately outsold Oasis' [...] "Roll With It" [...] by 274,000 copies to 216,000, becoming Blur's first number one single.|$|E

His wife expressed concern, but he told her, [...] "On what ma'am? When I arrive there it will be over!" [...] He travelled by train, reading periodicals and scientific magazines. Not imagining the gravity of the situation, he arrived at the city palace at 3p.m. André Rebouças suggested that he go to the countryside to organize resistance. The Marquis of Tamandaré asked for his permission to lead the Armada (navy) and suppress the rebellion. He dismissed all the ideas put forward and said, [...] "This is nothing. I know my countrymen." [...] The Emperor asked the Conservative senator Manuel Francisco Correia what he thought of the situation. Correia answered that he believed that {{it was the end of}} the monarchy.

[...] The post was quickly re-tweeted by famous blogger Han Han. By the time the government deleted both posts, the information had already been shared 70,000 times in the first 24 hours. [...] The International Herald Tribune immediately picked up the story, stating, [...] "The gruesome abortion incident was cast this weekend against China’s successful launching of its first female astronaut.

Vlad Ţepeş turned back and defeated the army, and according to the Historia Turchesca of Giovanni Maria Angiolello, sometimes attributed to an Italian chronicler Donado da Lezze, only 8,000 Turks survived. Vlad Ţepeş's campaign was celebrated among the Saxon cities of Transylvania, the Italian states and the Pope. A Venetian envoy, upon hearing about <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>at</b> the court of Corvinus on March 4, expressed great joy and said that the whole of Christianity should celebrate Vlad Ţepeş's successful campaign. An English pilgrim to the Holy Land, William Wey, passing through the island of Rhodes while on his way home, wrote that [...] "the military men of Rhodes, upon hearing of Vlad Ţepeş's campaign, had Te Deum sung in praise and honour of God who had granted such victories....The lord mayor of Rhodes convened his brother soldiers and the whole citizenry feasted on fruit and wine." [...] The Genoese from Caffa thanked Vlad Ţepeş, for his campaign had saved them from an attack of some 300 ships that the sultan planned to send against them. Many Turks were now frightened of Vlad and left the European side of their empire and moved into Anatolia. Mehmed, when hearing about the events, abandoned his siege at Corinth and decided to go against Vlad Ţepeş himself.|$|E
