25|$|Homology {{includes}} a unique group of shared structures {{referred to as}} vestigial structures. Vestigial refers to anatomical parts that are of minimal, if any, value to the organism that possesses them. These apparently illogical structures are remnants of organs that {{played an important role}} in ancestral forms. Such is the case in whales, which have small vestigial bones that appear to be remnants of the leg bones of their ancestors which walked on land. Humans also have vestigial structures, including the ear muscles, the wisdom teeth, the appendix, the <b>tail</b> <b>bone,</b> body hair (including goose bumps), and the semilunar fold in the corner of the eye.|$|E
25|$|Vertebrae {{are defined}} by the regions of the {{vertebral}} column that they occur in, as in humans. Cervical vertebrae are those in the neck area. With {{the exception of the}} two sloth genera (Choloepus and Bradypus) and the manatee genus, (Trichechus), all mammals have seven cervical vertebrae. In other vertebrates, the number of cervical vertebrae can range from a single vertebra in amphibians, to as many as 25 in swans or 76 in the extinct plesiosaur Elasmosaurus. The dorsal vertebrae range {{from the bottom of the}} neck to the top of the pelvis. Dorsal vertebrae attached to the ribs are called thoracic vertebrae, while those without ribs are called lumbar vertebrae. The sacral vertebrae are those in the pelvic region, and range from one in amphibians, to two in most birds and modern reptiles, or up to three to five in mammals. When multiple sacral vertebrae are fused into a single structure, it is called the sacrum. The synsacrum is a similar fused structure found in birds that is composed of the sacral, lumbar, and some of the thoracic and caudal vertebra, as well as the pelvic girdle. Caudal vertebrae compose the tail, and the final few can be fused into the pygostyle in birds, or into the coccygeal or <b>tail</b> <b>bone</b> in chimpanzees (and humans).|$|E

25|$|It had aquatic adaptations {{including}} flattened <b>tail</b> <b>bones</b> and {{remnants of}} soft tissue between {{the toes of}} the back feet, suggesting that they were webbed. Previously the earliest known semi-aquatic mammaliaforms were from the Eocene, about 110M years later.|$|R
50|$|It is {{composed}} of fossilized bones recovered by the German paleontologist Werner Janensch from the fossil-rich Tendaguru beds of Tanzania between 1909 and 1913. The remains are primarily from one gigantic animal, {{except for a few}} <b>tail</b> <b>bones</b> (caudal vertebrae), which belong to another animal of the same size and species.|$|R
50|$|It {{also had}} {{extremely}} strong fore limbs, with retractable, cat-like claws, a trait previously unseen in marsupials. Thylacoleo also possessed enormous hooded claws set on large semiopposable thumbs, which {{were used to}} capture and disembowel prey. The long muscular tail {{was similar to that}} of a kangaroo. Specialized <b>tail</b> <b>bones</b> called chevrons allowed the animal to tripod itself, and freed the front legs for slashing and grasping.|$|R
500|$|Lions are {{the only}} members of the cat family to display obvious sexual dimorphism. Males are more robust than females, have broader heads and a {{prominent}} mane, which grows downward and backward and covers most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. The mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust, and black hairs. The most distinctive characteristic shared by both females and males is that the tail ends in a dark, hairy tuft. In some lions, the tuft conceals a hard [...] "spine" [...] or [...] "spur", approximately 5mm long, formed of the final sections of <b>tail</b> <b>bone</b> fused together. The lion is the only felid to have a tufted tail – {{the function of the}} tuft and spine are unknown. Absent at birth, the tuft develops around months of age and is readily identifiable at 7months.|$|E
2500|$|Gary Jessome {{was born}} in North Sydney, Nova Scotia on November 7, 1978. He was working in Moncton, New Brunswick when he met Kingman and was invited to train at his Kardinal Sinners Wrestling School with himself and {{co-owner}} [...] "Kowboy" [...] Mike Hughes. Having a lifelong interest in weightlifting and bodybuilding, Jessome accepted and they soon began traveling to the Johnstons River area in Prince Edward Island where he and Kingman worked out in a barn while Mike Hughes taught him ring psychology and technical ability. He suffered numerous injuries during his time at the Kardinal Sinners [...] "boot camp" [...] including a concussion, whiplash, bruised kidneys, heels and <b>tail</b> <b>bone.</b> By {{the time of his}} graduation in 2001, Jessome was considered one of their top students and was later brought back to the school as a part-time trainer. Jessome has claimed that Kingman heavily influenced his career and wrestling style.|$|E
2500|$|Having felt he {{had nothing}} more to prove at college level, Ford decided to turn {{professional}} after his second year of college to enter the 2003 NBA draft, and was heralded by NBA.com as having [...] "the prescient ability to see the play before it happens, like Magic Johnson and Larry Bird". Ford was picked eighth {{in the first round}} by the Milwaukee Bucks in a very strong draft class, which featured future NBA All-Stars LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and Carmelo Anthony. In his first season, he led the Bucks in assists with 6.5 assists per game, while tallying 7.1 points per game (ppg). Ford was also selected to the NBA All-Rookie 2nd Team. However, he played in only 55 games that season before an injury forced him to miss the final 26 games of the regular season and the 2004 NBA Playoffs. The injury occurred on February 24, 2004, during a home game versus the Minnesota Timberwolves where he fell on his <b>tail</b> <b>bone</b> after being fouled by center Mark Madsen. He suffered a contusion of the spinal cord, a career-threatening injury.|$|E
500|$|Paleontologist Charles Whitney Gilmore and {{geologist}} Dan R.

The wings are relatively large and darker in colour, with long tips {{that allow the}} bat to hover. Despite having two caudal vertebrae, Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat has no visible tail. There is a large web of skin between the hind legs (the uropatagium) which may assist in flying and catching insects, {{although there are no}} <b>tail</b> <b>bones</b> or calcars to help control it in flight.|$|R
50|$|The {{phylogeny}} of the Anurognathidae is uncertain. Some analyses, {{as those}} of Kellner, place them very basal in the pterosaur tree. However, they do have some characteristics {{in common with the}} derived Pterodactyloidea, such as the short and fused <b>tail</b> <b>bones.</b> In 2010 an analysis by Brian Andres indicated the Anurognathidae and the Pterodactyloidea were sister taxa. This conforms better to the fossil record because no early anurognathids are known and would require a ghost lineage of over sixty million years.|$|R

5000|$|St. John is an English {{restaurant}} on St John Street in Smithfield, London. It was opened in October 1994 by Fergus Henderson, Trevor Gulliver and Jon Spiteri, {{on the premises}} of a former bacon smoke-house. Under Henderson's guidance as head chef, St. John has specialised in [...] "nose to tail eating", with a devotion to offal and other cuts of meat rarely seen in restaurants, often reclaiming traditional British recipes. Typical dishes include pigs' ears, ducks' hearts, trotters, pigs' <b>tails,</b> <b>bone</b> marrow and, when in season, squirrel. As result, St. John has developed a following amongst gastronomic circles: [...] "chefs, foodies, food writers and cooks on sabbatical".|$|R

50|$|Because no <b>tail</b> <b>bones</b> are known, {{the total}} body length of Oedaleops is uncertain. The {{length of the}} dorsal {{vertebral}} column (the length of vertebrae making up the back) can be estimated at around 20 cm from the lengths of individual dorsal vertebrae in Oedaleops {{and the number of}} dorsal vertebrae present in related synapsids. Adding the length of the skull gives a snout-vent length (the length of the body from the tip of the skull to hips) of 25 cm. Like other early synapsids, Oedaleops probably had sprawling limbs and a body set low to the ground. The front of the body may have been slightly elevated above the level of the hips.|$|R
500|$|The largest known ankylosaurid, Ankylosaurus is {{estimated}} to have been between [...] long, [...] tall, and weighed about [...] It was quadrupedal, with a broad, robust body. It had a wide, low skull, with two horns pointing backwards {{from the back of}} the head, and two horns below these that pointed backwards and down. The front part of the jaws were covered in a beak, with rows of small, leaf-shaped teeth further behind it. It was covered in armor plates, or osteoderms, with bony half-rings covering the neck, and had a large club on the end of its <b>tail.</b> <b>Bones</b> in the skull and other parts of the body were fused, increasing their strength, and this feature is the source of the genus name.|$|R

The diaphyses of "hot" vertebrae were cylindrical but "cold" and "control" vertebrae were of narrower diameter in their mid-diaphyses compared to their distal ends producing a "waisted" appearance. The "cold" vertebrae in addition showed thickened cortical bone and more woven bone in the marrow cavity. These changes were interpreted as indicating a disproportionate sensitivity of external apposition of cortical bone to cold. The internal remodelling of bone as the vertebrae grew was only affected by the coldest conditions and accounted for the thickened cortex and denser woven bone in the marrow cavity...|$|R

5000|$|As for {{the meaning}} of [...] "Aqlivusta," [...] Rashi has {{explained}} as being the small bone lying on that bone which, French, is called hanche (haunch or hip), and {{is connected to the}} vertebrae of the tail the sheep. But Rabbi Yitzhak Alfasi explained as that bone which holds fast all the other bones, while the Kol Bo has written Rashi's explanation under his name. Yet, the known as Sefer Mitzvot Gedolot (Hasemag) has written under the prohibitive command # 138, Tarba de-Aqlivusta: Rashi has explained the Qaliboseth (i.e. <b>tail</b> <b>bone)</b> as being the small bone lying on that bone which is called French hanche (haunch or hip), and is connected to the vertebrae of the tail the sheep from above, upon which there is suet beneath the loin, and which is among that suet found on the flanks.Now these are the words used by Rabbi A. of Meitze: [...] "Near the tail can be found the edible fat of the sheep's tail, upon which is the suet of the Qaliboseth (i.e. <b>tail</b> <b>bone),</b> and that same suet and edible fat of the sheep's tail cling one to another, etc." [...] But in book Sheiltot of Rabbi Ahai Gaon, and in book Halachot Gedolot, they have written: [...] "The suet which is upon the flanks is the suet of the Qaliboseth (i.e. <b>tail</b> <b>bone),</b> where the hind legs attach themselves." [...] Likewise has Maimonides, of blessed memory, written: [...] "is the suet which is at the joints of the hind legs from within." [...] Yet, in book Sefer Hazikkaron, he explained Tarba de-Aqlivusta as the place where the thighs are attached, etc., while in an Arabic commentary on the laws governing Ritual Slaughter find that Qaliboseth means [...] "al-falakh." ...|$|E
50|$|Zhongyuansaurus is an extinct genus of ankylosaurid ankylosaurian dinosaur {{from the}} Lower Cretaceous of Ruyang, Henan, China. It is known from remains {{including}} skull, arm, pelvic, and <b>tail</b> <b>bones.</b> It is distinguished by {{characteristics such as}} a flat roof to the skull, a straight ischium, {{and the location of}} muscle attachments on the upper arm. The type species, Z. luoyangensis, was described by Xu and colleagues in 2007. Zhongyuansaurus was described by Xu et al. as the first Chinese nodosaurid based primarily upon the absence of a tail club and its elongate skull, but was reevaluated in 2008 by Kenneth Carpenter and colleagues as a shamosaurine ankylosaurid, a type of ankylosaurid lacking a tail club. A new cladistic analysis performed by Thompson et al., 2011 suggests that Zhongyuansaurus is the basalmost known ankylosaurine and thus it is the first species of this clade known to lack a tail club. In 2014, Victoria Megan Arbour concluded that Zhongyuansaurus was a probable junior synonym of Gobisaurus.|$|R
