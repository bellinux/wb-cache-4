25|$|Taxation in South Africa {{may involve}} {{payments}} {{to a minimum}} of two different levels of government: central government through the South African Revenue Service (SARS) or to local government. Central government revenues come primarily from income <b>tax,</b> <b>value</b> added tax (VAT), corporation tax and fuel duty. Local government revenues come primarily from grants from central government funds and municipal rates. In the 2012/2013 fiscal year SARS collected R813.8 billion (equivalent to US$ 73.1 billion) in tax revenue, a figure R71.2 billion (or 9.6%) more than that from the previous fiscal year. In 2012/13 financial year South Africa had a tax-to-GDP ratio of 25.3% reflecing a marginal increase from 25% in 2011/12.|$|E

50|$|Common {{property}} <b>taxes</b> include land <b>value,</b> {{which usually}} has a separate assessment. Thus, land value taxation already exists in many jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions {{have attempted to}} rely more heavily on it. In Pennsylvania certain cities raised the <b>tax</b> on land <b>value</b> while reducing the <b>tax</b> on improvement/building/structure <b>values.</b> For example, the city of Altoona adopted a property tax that solely <b>taxes</b> land <b>value</b> in 2002 but repealed the tax in 2016.|$|R
25|$|The {{federal income}} tax system {{provides}} tax advantages {{to state and local}} municipal bonds. Specifically, the interest paid on such securities is exempt from federal taxation. This tax discount allows state and local governments to issue debt at low yields, which reduces their interest costs. By eliminating income taxes, FairTax would remove the federal tax advantage of holding state and local bonds as all investments would become tax free. However, the Treasury department has called for the elimination of these special tax provisions under the current system in an effort to broaden the tax base and reduce corporate tax rates. State and local governments often exempt their own taxes when issuing bonds, so they could still contain some advantages. Issuers may have to offer higher interest rates to attract investors. Americans For Fair Taxation argue that, after the fair tax goes into effect, corporate bond rates would drop; that new tax free yields will roughly equal their previous after <b>tax</b> <b>value</b> under the income tax; and that state and municipal bond holders would not need to change their rates.|$|E

5000|$|Standard {{economic}} {{theory suggests that}} a land <b>value</b> <b>tax</b> would be extremely efficient - unlike other taxes, it does not reduce economic productivity. Milton Friedman described Henry George's <b>tax</b> on unimproved <b>value</b> of land as the [...] "least bad tax", since unlike other taxes, it would not impose an excess burden on economic activity (leading to zero or even negative [...] "deadweight loss"); hence, a replacement of other more distortionary taxes with a land <b>value</b> <b>tax</b> would improve economic welfare. As land <b>value</b> <b>tax</b> can improve the use of land and redirect investment toward productive, non-rentseeking activities, it could even have a negative deadweight loss that boosts productivity. Because land <b>value</b> <b>tax</b> would apply to foreign land speculators, the Australian Treasury estimated that land <b>value</b> <b>tax</b> was unique in having a negative marginal excess burden, meaning that it would increase long-run living standards.|$|R
