Chandru, who had come on that motorbike, had parked it there and murdered a prostitute who enticed him near the same location, then rode away. Reading about the murder in a newspaper, Bhaskar shows Raghunath the pictures with the murderer's motorbike in the background. Raghunath investigates and learns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> has lent it to his friend.|$|E
5|$|Jackie's friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall {{had become}} {{suspicious}} {{as to whether}} Jackie's date to the fraternity party where she was allegedly raped was a real person. Prior to the date, they attempted to locate him in a student directory and were unable to find evidence that he existed. The trio also sent text messages to a phone number Jackie said was the mobile phone of her date and were surprised <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> of the phone number responded primarily with flattering messages about Randall, whom Jackie was romantically interested in.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett Helmet is {{a copper}} alloy Roman cavalry helmet {{dating from the}} late 2nd or early 3rd century AD. It was found by an unnamed metal detectorist near Crosby Garrett in Cumbria, England, in May 2010. Later {{investigations}} found that a Romano-British farming settlement had occupied {{the site where the}} helmet was discovered, which was located a few miles away from a Roman road and a Roman army fort. It is possible <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> of the helmet was a local inhabitant who had served with the Roman cavalry.|$|E

50|$|The current {{collective}} bargaining agreement was reached in July 2005, and expired at 12:01 EST on July 1, 2011, following completion of the 2010-11 NBA season, resulting in a lockout, similar to the 2011 NFL lockout. ESPN has reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> and players failed {{to reach an agreement}} and broke off negotiations, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> began a lockout immediately after the {{collective bargaining}} agreement expired.|$|R
50|$|The Collins Zoo {{was founded}} in 1986 by Gus White. The zoo has been raided several times by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. MDWF&P have never won a single case against the Zoo. The last raid was ruled unconstitutional.

5|$|A {{number of}} scenes then follow whose exact {{sequence}} is unclear. Odd goes {{to visit his}} mother at the retirement home, which only makes him more unhappy: his mother is senile and spends her days staring emptily out the window, and the visit reminds him of his own impending old age. While Odd is at a restaurant, police come in and arrest the cook. At the shop where he normally buys his pipe tobacco, he learns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> has died. He decides to sell his boat, leading to misadventures when the buyer, who works at an airport, asks Odd to meet him there inside the secure zone. Odd goes to the local swimming pool, but his shoes were removed when the facility closed; as he is leaving, he finds a pair of red high-heeled boots and walks away in them.|$|E
5|$|Forensic entomology: The Song Dynasty (960–1279) {{forensic}} science book Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified published by court judge, physician, medical scientist and writer Song Ci in 1247 contains the oldest known case of forensic entomology. In {{a murder case}} of 1235, a villager was stabbed to death and authorities determined that his wounds were inflicted by a sickle; this was a tool used for cutting rice at harvest time, a fact which led them to suspect a fellow peasant worker was involved. The local magistrate had the villagers assemble {{in the town square}} where they would temporarily relinquish their sickles. Within minutes, a mass of blow flies gathered around one sickle and none other, attracted to the scent of traces of blood unseen by the naked eye. It became apparent to all <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> of that sickle was the culprit, the latter pleading for mercy as he was detained by authorities.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{two more}} fire mishaps {{occurred}} in the leather industries in the area, one {{in the month of}} March and the other in June: a total of nine people got injured in these two incidents. Even though fire safety licenses and insurances for the workers of the leather factories were made mandatory after the fire incident of 2006, none of the authorities—the municipal corporation, the services department of the state government, and the police—ensured that these were actually followed by the factories. The local residents claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> of the factory that was impacted in the fire incident of 2006, now operates from another address of the same area. According to fire brigade officials, the Topsia area along with nearby Tiljala and Tangra forms the most fire-prone area of the city, and that around three to four fires break out every week, though they do not get reported in the media as there is no loss of life.|$|E

5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of the fitting out offense. First, the Court held that the offense of fitting out a vessel for slave trading could be committed even if the owner of the vessel did not personally fit it out. Second, the Court held that the statute could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed to a complete fitting out) of a vessel for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, the Court held that, for the statute to be violated, the fitting out must have occurred within the United States. Finally, the Court held that the statute's mens rea required <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} and excavation of the Hoxne Hoard improved {{the relationship between}} the archaeological profession and the community of metal detectorists. Archaeologists were pleased that Lawes reported the find promptly and largely undisturbed, allowing a professional excavation. Metal detectorists noted that Lawes' efforts were appreciated by the archaeological profession. The 1996 Treasure Act is thought to have contributed to more hoards being made available to archaeologists. The act changed the law so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> of the land and the person who finds the hoard have a strong stake {{in the value of the}} discovery. The manner of the finding of the Hoxne Hoard by metal detector, and its widespread publicity, contributed to changing the previous system of common law for dealing with treasure trove into a statutory legal framework that takes into account technology such as metal detectors, provides incentives for treasure hunters to report finds, and considers the needs of museums and scholars.|$|E

25|$|Lloyd's Register listed Countess of Harcourt from 1818 to 1831. One {{concern with}} Lloyd's Register {{information}} {{is that a}} lack of change may either mean that nothing has changed from the previous year, or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> did not provide updated information.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacies are {{typically}} {{required to have}} a pharmacist on-duty at all times when open.

25|$|Although the Bronx District Attorney {{said they}} were not {{responsible}} criminally, the New York City Corporation Counsel filed misdemeanor charges during February 1991 against DiLorenzo, the building owner, and Weiss, the landlord. These charges claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> and landlord were responsible for the building code violations caused by their tenant. They both pleaded guilty during May 1992, agreeing to perform community service and paying $150,000 towards a community center for Hondurans in the Bronx.|$|E
25|$|A {{property}} tax (or millage tax) is an {{ad valorem tax}} levy {{on the value of}} property <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> of the property is required to pay to a government in which the property is situated.

25|$|It {{was also}} {{stated in the}} press release <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> of mega yacht Pelorus — Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich — was not the {{customer}} behind Sigma. Nevertheless, because Pelorus was undergoing a concurrent refit at the same shipyard, and because both projects shared the same management company, there was continued speculation that the two vessels had a common owner throughout As construction. Melnichenko was not confirmed as the true owner until after the ship was delivered in July 2008.|$|E
