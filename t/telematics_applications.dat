40|$|Abstract—Telematics {{applications}} in automobiles have attracted considerable attention for their promise of value-added services. However, new challenges {{arise from the}} integration of <b>telematics</b> <b>applications</b> that require a multitude of vehicular data. The safety-critical context of the automotive domain calls for reliable access control mechanisms, especially when applications access sensitive data. However, those mechanisms must also respect the requirement of minimal driver distraction. To cope with these issues we propose Ginger – an access control framework for <b>telematics</b> <b>applications.</b> Ginger is context aware, provides enhanced privacy protection, and realizes advanced access control paradigms. We demonstrate Ginger’s feasibility with an Androidbased implementation in a functional evaluation consisting of two representative use cases and in a comparative analysis with related approaches.

An important conclusion is that there are great societal and economical interests related to the telematics implementation. The mobility in a densely populated country like The Netherlands has to be controlled. However, transport is an important support for the economics. Road traffic hazard costs a lot of money. At the same time, telematics provides a great potential. Therefore, it is important to control the <b>telematics</b> <b>application</b> in traffic and transport, without stopping any future developments in advance. The recommendation describes how telematics can be implemented in the short term and in the medium term. The safety of traffic and transport is taken into account in particular.

40|$|In any {{course in}} {{instructional}} design, the design principles {{should not only}} be covered in the course content, but also demonstrated by {{the structure of the}} course itself. <b>Telematics</b> <b>applications</b> of various sorts can bring new dimensions into the instructional design of the course to better illustrate the subject matter.

We call such an augmented learning process a “tele-learning” situation because <b>telematics</b> <b>applications</b> are involved. We conclude that such a course-support environment can extend the teaching and learning process, if well designed, by bringing added opportunities for communication and coaching, and by increasing student self-responsibility.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the prospects for}} industrialized and developing countries in the international market of <b>telematics</b> <b>applications</b> to education. The discussion evolves around three issues. One {{is the relationship between}} telecommunication infrastructure and wider <b>telematics</b> <b>applications.</b> Telecommunication requirements of such applications to education would add to the reasons for infrastructure upgrading, which have international trade effects. The second issue is the currently narrow choice customers have in the international market where suppliers are concentrated in the USA and Canada and products are dominantly in the English language. Demands for diversification of suppliers and of offer in various languages will created opportunities for content producers in developing countries and push for stronger international trade. Finally, the third issue is the risk this new area of trade may represent for educational and training policy decisions in developing countries. Scarce resources may be diverted from cheaper and more efficient ways of addressing the educational agenda to more expensive and not necessary the most adequate solutions. A careful assessment of educational and training needs and new forms of collaboration have to be created for this new area of trade to be beneficial to industrialized and developing countries.

40|$|Telematics, the {{combination}} of communication and information technology, offers {{a wide range of}} possibilities for education. <b>Telematics</b> <b>applications</b> include e-mail, groupware, and all the possibilities of the World Wide Web (WWW). Educational insti-tutions and jurisdictions throughout the world are investing in Internet access and in creating the conditions so various kinds of <b>telematics</b> <b>applications</b> can be available to teachers and learners. But a major question is: Will the intended users, teachers and learners, actually make use of all these possibilities? What fac-tors have the most impact, both positive and negative, in terms of the individual teacher or student’s decision to make use of a telematics application? In a research project underway in The Netherlands, using data from a number of countries, these ques-tions are being addressed. In this article we describe the theoreti-cal model derived for our research. The model involves four main clusters of variables related to external context, educational ef-fectiveness, ease of use, and personal engagement and is thus called the 4 -E Model.
