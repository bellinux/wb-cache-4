However, this equivalent form applies only to a crease pattern on a flat piece of paper, whereas the alternating sum form of the condition remains valid for crease patterns on conical sheets of paper with nonzero defect at the vertex.|$|E
5|$|King Coenwulf of Mercia {{may have}} {{supported}} the unfortunate Ealhmund, and Symeon of Durham wrote that in 801:Eardwulf, king of the Northumbrians, led an army against Coenwulf, king of Mercians, because he had given asylum to his enemies. He also, collecting an army, obtained very many auxiliaries from other provinces, having made a long expedition among them.

2500|$|In {{hyperbolic}} geometry, <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of parallelism [...] , is <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> at one vertex {{of a right}} hyperbolic triangle {{that has}} two asymptotic parallel sides. <b>The</b> <b>angle</b> depends on <b>the</b> segment length a between <b>the</b> right <b>angle</b> and <b>the</b> vertex of <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of parallelism.|$|R

50|$|In geometry, symmedians {{are three}} {{particular}} geometrical lines associated with every triangle.

5|$|After {{the end of}} Roman rule in Britain, {{the region}} now known as East Anglia was settled by a North Germanic group known as <b>the</b> <b>Angles,</b> {{although}} {{there is evidence of}} early settlement of the region by a minority of other peoples, for instance the Swabians, who settled in the area around the modern town of Swaffham. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in the territories of southern Britain conquered by <b>the</b> <b>Angles,</b> Saxons, Jutes and Frisians. The ruling dynasty of East Anglia was the Wuffingas, named from Wuffa, an early king. The first king known to have ruled is Rædwald, whose reign spanned {{a quarter of a century}} from about 599.|$|E

50|$|A {{plane mirror}} is a mirror {{with a flat}} (planar) {{reflective}} surface. For light rays striking a plane mirror, <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of reflection equals <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of incidence. <b>The</b> <b>angle</b> of incidence is <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> between <b>the</b> incident ray and the surface normal (an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface).

5|$|It {{can also}} be {{expressed}} as a sum of <b>the</b> <b>angles</b> between the normal vectors at consecutive pairs of inflection points. It is 2 for convex curves and larger for non-convex curves, serving {{as a measure of}} non-convexity of a curve.|$|E
5|$|Kawasaki's theorem is a theorem in the {{mathematics}} of paper folding {{that describes the}} crease patterns with a single vertex that may be folded to form a flat figure.

50|$|To use the {{tomahawk}} to trisect an angle, it {{is placed}} with its handle line touching {{the apex of}} <b>the</b> <b>angle,</b> with <b>the</b> blade inside <b>the</b> <b>angle,</b> tangent {{to one of the}} two rays forming <b>the</b> <b>angle,</b> and with <b>the</b> spike touching the other ray of <b>the</b> <b>angle.</b> One of <b>the</b> two trisecting lines then lies on the handle segment, and the other passes through the center point of the semicircle. If <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> to be trisected is too sharp relative to the length of the tomahawk's handle, it may not be possible to fit the tomahawk into <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> in this way, but this difficulty may be worked around by repeatedly doubling <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> until it is large enough for the tomahawk to trisect it, and then repeatedly bisecting <b>the</b> trisected <b>angle</b> <b>the</b> same number of times as <b>the</b> original <b>angle</b> was doubled.|$|R

5|$|The {{earliest}} form of English {{is called}} Old English or Anglo-Saxon (c. 550–1066 CE). Old English developed from {{a set of}} North Sea Germanic dialects originally spoken along the coasts of Frisia, Lower Saxony, Jutland, and Southern Sweden by Germanic tribes known as <b>the</b> <b>Angles,</b> Saxons, and Jutes. In the fifth century, the Anglo-Saxons settled Britain as the Roman economy and administration collapsed. By the seventh century, the Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in Britain, replacing the languages of Roman Britain (43–409 CE): Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and Latin, brought to Britain by the Roman occupation. England and English (originally Ænglaland and Ænglisc) are named after <b>the</b> <b>Angles.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of view from <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of coverage, which describes <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> range that a lens can image.

If <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of coverage of the lens does not fill the sensor, the image circle will be visible, typically with strong vignetting toward the edge, and <b>the</b> effective <b>angle</b> of view will be limited to <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of coverage.|$|R

5|$|A dam {{constructed}} by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the Cumberland River in 1966, and the lake it forms, were named Barkley Dam and Lake Barkley in Barkley's honor.

5|$|English is a North Sea Germanic {{language}} that was first spoken in early medieval England {{and is now}} a global lingua franca.

It is closely related to the Frisian languages, but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as by Latin and Romance languages, especially French.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are able}} to recognize or distort the Holliday junction structure. One such class contains junction-resolving enzymes that cleave the junctions, sometimes in a sequence-specific fashion. Such proteins distort {{the structure of the}} junction in various ways, often pulling the junction into an unstacked conformation, breaking the central base pairs, and/or changing <b>the</b> <b>angles</b> between the four arms. Other classes are branch migration proteins that increase the exchange rate by orders of magnitude, and site-specific recombinases. In prokaryotes, Holliday junction resolvases fall into two families, integrases and nucleases, that are each structurally similar although their sequences are not conserved.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the wing}} is stalled and <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of attack {{is greater than}} <b>the</b> {{stalling}} <b>angle</b> any increase in angle of attack causes a decrease in lift coefficient that causes the wing to descend. As the wing descends <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of attack increases, which causes the lift coefficient to decrease and <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of attack to increase. Conversely any decrease in angle of attack causes an increase in lift coefficient that causes the wing to rise. As the wing rises <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of attack decreases and causes the lift coefficient to increase further towards the maximum lift coefficient. For this reason <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of attack is unstable when it is greater than <b>the</b> stalling <b>angle.</b> Any disturbance of <b>the</b> <b>angle</b> of attack on one wing will cause the whole wing to roll spontaneously and continuously.|$|R
