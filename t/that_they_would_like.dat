Local lords of the manor indicated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to give their rights to the wastes to the public. After preventing the enclosure of a common in 1882, negotiations were initiated with the owners of the northern hills and the first Malvern Hills Act was secured in parliament in 1884. Later Acts empowered the Malvern Hills Conservators to acquire land to prevent further encroachment on common land and by 1925 they had bought much of the manorial wastelands.|$|E

When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> {{to make the}} bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers {{that he was having}} a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E

25|$|Before any {{fighting}} resumed, {{some on the}} Chinese side {{sent out}} peace feelers {{to the court of}} Ava.

But the emperor, with Fuheng's encouragement, made it clear that no compromise with the Burmese could be made. The dignity of the state demanded a full surrender. His aim was to establish direct Qing rule over all Burmese possessions. Emissaries were sent to Siam and Laotian states informing them of the Chinese ambition and seeking an alliance.|$|E

40|$|Almost all governments {{which have}} not already {{achieved}} the goal of universal primary education state <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> to do so.

The paper does not suggest that governments should necessarily abandon the goal, but it does recommend more critical appraisal of objectives, of the mechanisms through which they can be achieved, and of overall priorities. © 1986. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
