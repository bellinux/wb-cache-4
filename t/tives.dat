40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 42 - 43) Ethylenic and acetylenic esters {{have been}} found to undergo nucleophilic addition with 2 - (lH) -pyridone and 4 - (lH) -pyridone. With acetylenic monoesters, pyridones yielded predominantly the trans compound. With acetylenic diesters, pyridones yielded predominantly fumarate deriva- <b>tives.</b> Under the experimental conditions, maleate deriva- <b>tives</b> were shown to isomerize to fumarate derivatives. Assumptions in the literature regarding the stereo?? chemistry of products obtained from the nucleophilic addition of pyridone to unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds have been clarified as have some conflicting opinions regarding the stereochemical outcome of additions to acetylenic esters. Several pmr spectra are reproduced as evidence for the structures postulated and to illustrate the spectral relationships between various compounds...|$|E

50|$|Other {{artists such}} as Rick Derringer, Barrence Whitfield & the Savages, and The Symptoms started {{recording}} his songs, and <b>Tiven</b> dedicated himself to primarily writing songs for other artists. In 1985 he renewed a friendship with his hero Don Covay, and they wrote, performed, and recorded together through 2001. A label approached him {{to make his own}} record, and so was formed The Jon <b>Tiven</b> Group who recorded two albums, Blue Guru and Yes I Ram in 1996 and 1999 respectively. The band featured Jon <b>Tiven</b> on guitar, Alan Merrill on lead vocals, Todd Snare on drums, and Tiven's wife Sally <b>Tiven</b> on bass. <b>Tiven</b> started having some Billboard Hot 100 chart success with covered songs recorded by Huey Lewis and the News and The Jeff Healey Band, and <b>Tiven</b> then submitted some songs to B.B. King to record. The sessions <b>Tiven</b> produced and wrote by B.B. King were parcelled out on several releases, including Here and There, a European release Lucille & Friends, and the Grammy-award winning box set King of the Blues. From that time on <b>Tiven</b> would distinguish himself in the soul and blues genres, writing and producing new albums by Don Covay, Syl Johnson, Donnie Fritts, Freddie Scott, and Mack Rice, among others. He coaxed Arthur Alexander out of retirement in 1990 and, in 1998, produced and co-wrote Wilson Pickett's first album in seventeen years, It's Harder Now, which won three W.C. Handy Awards and was nominated for a Grammy.|$|R
