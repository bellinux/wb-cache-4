500|$|According to AllMusic {{reviewer}} Kurt Morris, Tell All Your Friends {{is similar}} to the Movielife's This <b>Time</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Year</b> (2000); Taking Back Sunday's [...] "ability ... to sound so blatantly" [...] like the Movielife was [...] "almost their undoing". Morris wrote that the vocals strongly resembled those of the Canterbury Effect, and called Taking Back Sunday [...] "a bit more rockin than the Movielife: [...] "They have cultivated punk, hardcore, emo, and pop and hybridized it better." [...] However, Morris called the album [...] "nowhere near original or creative". Rolling Stones Gil Kaufman wrote that the album [...] "sidesteps many sad-sack emo pitfalls" [...] with [...] "pop-infused hardcore" [...] and [...] "enlightened, dramatic lyrics" [...] describing [...] "heartache that teeter between despondency and dark vengeance". Peter White of Drowned in Sound wrote that the album contained He added that the album featured [...] "Nihilistic, angry pop gems covered in monster riffs" [...] that [...] "screams to rival anything on an Obituary record".|$|E
500|$|The {{debut album}} from the unknown Blunt {{initially}} attracted little critical attention, {{and there were}} no published reviews from major UK music journals. His live performances, mainly in support of better known musicians, received somewhat mixed but generally favourable reviews. His lack of performing experience and inconsistent approach with audiences was commented upon, while his music was likened to that of Damien Rice and David Gray. In March 2004, with Blunt performing in the support role for Katie Melua in Manchester, Alex McCann of Designer Magazine wrote, [...] "Blunt's ascendance is a dead cert and this <b>time</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> it isn't that far removed from reality to suggest that a number one album, Brit Award and countless accolade's [...] will be his for the taking." [...] After release of the album, concert support slots for Elton John and Lloyd Cole and the Commotions in late 2004 and early 2005 followed, as did a band residency at London club 93 Feet East. In March 2005, his second single, [...] "Wisemen," [...] was released.|$|E

500|$|In a United States {{hardware}} sales {{estimate for}} July 2011 by Gamasutra following the DS Lite's price drop a month earlier, about 60 to 70 percent of approximately 290,000 DS units sold were DSi and DSi XL consoles. Lackluster 3DS sales forced Nintendo to drop its price {{to match the}} DSi XL in the United States on August 12. Japan and Europe had similar price reductions. Gamasutra speculated potential DS buyers in the United States opted for the 3DS as a result; DS sales for August 2011 decreased by 45 percent, while it combined with 3DS sales remained steady compared to the previous month. Nintendo made its second DSi and DSi XL price cuts in North America on May 20, 2012. Gamasutra called these price cuts the DS product line's [...] "final send-off" [...] and expects [...] "by this <b>time</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> its contributions to the market will be minuscule. After Christmas, Nintendo will effectively be a single-handheld system company, putting all of portable software efforts into the Nintendo 3DS." ...|$|E

The video begins with the band wondering about Reyes whereabouts, before shifting to Reyes dancing on an empty stage. The idea for it was proposed by the group's tour manager. Cooper said: [...] "Back before we even started touring, we’d go out to clubs on Long Island together and Eddie [...] would be tearing up the dance floor ... {{is by far the}} best dancer of the band." [...] On March 21, 2012, a music video was released for [...] "This Is All Now". Directed by Greg Hunter and Josh Romero of Dionysian Entertainment, they had shot the footage during the previous summer and created a music video with it. The group was so impressed they selected it as an official video. In April, the band toured Australia with New Found Glory and This <b>Time</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Year.</b> Between June and August, they were one of the headliners of the 2012 edition of Warped Tour.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} several plans to produce an American version.

The other, entitled This <b>Time</b> <b>Next</b> <b>Year...,</b> would have seen the Trotters renamed the Flannagans. A draft script was written for the latter, but neither show materialised. In 2010 Steve Carell, star of the US version of The Office, expressed an interest in making an American version of the series, with him to star as Del Boy. In January 2012 US network ABC commissioned a pilot of an Only Fools and Horses remake titled [...] "King of Van Nuys", written by Scrubs writers Steven Cragg and Brian Bradley. It was developed, rejected and then redeveloped – only to be rejected again later in the year.
