5|$|In the 1950s, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that the light pollution from Cleveland was beginning to make cutting-edge research impossible from the East Cleveland site. A new site was constructed 30 miles to the east in Geauga County, known today as the Nassau Station, and the Burrell Schmidt <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> moved to this location. In order to compensate for the move, a 36-inch <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> soon installed at the Taylor Road facility.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry at Jodrell Bank started {{before the}} Lovell <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> constructed, using the Transit Telescope with a 35 square meter {{broadside}} array {{to determine the}} size of radio-loud nebulae. Once construction of the Lovell <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> complete, the broadside array was put on a steerable mount and the pair were used as a tracking radio interferometer. This was then {{used to determine the}} 2D shape of quasars on the sky.Rowson (1963) In the summer of 1961, a 25-foot (8-m) diameter paraboloid <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> constructed (it was made of aluminium tubing and was mounted on the rotating structure of an old defence radar). This was then used as a steerable interferometer with the Mark I, with a resolution of 0.3 arcseconds, to determine the sizes of some high-redshift (z~0.86) quasars.|$|E
50|$|The Viper <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> mainly used to view cosmic {{background}} radiation. The <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> currently helping scientists prove or disprove the Big Crunch theory. The <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> {{also one}} of the most powerful of its kind. Previous cosmic background <b>telescopes</b> <b>were</b> smaller and did not have the ability to focus on the detailed measurement of distant clouds that Viper does.|$|R
50|$|Many space <b>telescopes</b> have <b>been</b> launched. , over 20 <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> {{known to}} be operational.|$|R
50|$|A Tower <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> a <b>telescope</b> {{with a large}} {{refraction}} length {{at which}} the tube is installed inside a tower. Tower <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> mainly used for examinations of the sun.|$|R
5|$|The Rooftop Telescope is a 9.5-inch {{refractor}} {{that was}} originally constructed in 1894 by Warner and Swasey {{for their own}} use. The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> the first instrument of the Warner and Swasey Observatory and was originally used at the Taylor Road facility, but was put into storage when the Astronomy Department of Case Western Reserve University was relocated to the A. W. Smith building on the main campus. In 1986 the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> reinstalled in a new dome {{on the roof of}} the A. W. Smith building.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy {{classes at}} the University of Illinois date to its {{earliest}} days. The first courses focused on measurement {{of the night sky}} and was taken by civil engineering students to sharpen their surveying skills. A small observatory consisting of a 4-inch refractor and a small transit <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> constructed by 1872. The astronomy courses were typically taught by the mathematics department and by the early 1890s, several mathematics instructors wanted to do more with astronomy. An expanded astronomy curriculum would require a new larger facility. The Illinois state legislature voted in 1895 to fund a new teaching observatory at the University of Illinois, providing $15,000 for construction. The site chosen was a grass knoll between Matthews Avenue and Burrill Avenue, just north of the Morrow Plots, a National Historic Landmark that is the nation's oldest experimental field. Contracts were extended to Charles A. Gunn, the architect and an instructor on campus, and Bevis and Company in Urbana as the general contractor with construction beginning in April 1896. The building was completed by August at a total cost of $6,800. The principle <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> installed in November and the final <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> in place by February 1897.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{following}} {{the resumption of}} shuttle flights in 1988, {{the launch of the}} <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> scheduled for 1990. On April 24, 1990, shuttle mission STS-31 saw Discovery launch the telescope successfully into its planned orbit.|$|E

500|$|Leuschner Observatory houses two optical telescopes, {{one with}} a [...] {{diameter}} {{and the other with}} a [...] diameter. As of 2010, the [...] <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> not usable, and the [...] <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> undergoing upgrades. The [...] <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> of Ritchey-Chretien design, and is equipped with both a charge coupled device (CCD) for observations in visible light and an infrared detector that was fabricated in 2000 in order to create an infrared laboratory course for undergraduate students at UC Berkeley. Both optical <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> also outfitted with control systems which allow them be automated, meaning observations are made with minimal human intervention.|$|R
5|$|In the {{following}} years, the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> used to track {{a variety of}} space probes. Between 11 March and 12 June 1960, it tracked the Pioneer 5 probe. The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> also used to send commands to the probe, including the one to separate the probe from its carrier rocket and the ones {{to turn on the}} more powerful transmitter when the probe was eight million miles away. It also received data from the probe, being the only telescope in the world capable of doing so at the time.Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 In February 1966, Jodrell Bank was asked by the Soviet Union to track the USSR unmanned moon lander Luna 9 and recorded on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the moon's surface. The photos were sent to the British press and published before the Soviets themselves had made the photos public.|$|E
5|$|On 9 and 10 October 1946, the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> used {{to observe}} the {{ionisation}} in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the Giacobinids meteor shower. When the antenna was turned by 90 degrees at the maximum of the shower, the number of detections dropped to the background level, proving that the transient signals detected by radar were indeed from meteors. Shortly after this, the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> {{used to determine the}} radiant points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at the radiant point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it. The telescope, as well as other receivers on the site, was also used to study auroral streamers that were visible at the site in early August 1947.|$|E
5|$|Once the 342 {{individual}} {{images were}} cleaned of cosmic-ray hits and corrected for scattered light, {{they had to}} be combined. Scientists involved in the HDF observations pioneered a technique called 'drizzling', in which the pointing of the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> varied minutely between sets of exposures. Each pixel on the WFPC2 CCD chips recorded an area of sky 0.09 arcseconds across, but by changing the direction in which the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> pointing by less than that between exposures, the resulting images were combined using sophisticated image-processing techniques to yield a final angular resolution better than this value. The HDF images produced at each wavelength had final pixel sizes of 0.03985 arcseconds.|$|E
50|$|The Submillimeter Telescope (SMT), {{formerly}} known as the Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter <b>Telescope,</b> <b>is</b> a submillimeter wavelength radio telescope located on Mount Graham, Arizona. It is a 10-meter-wide parabolic dish inside a building to protect it from bad weather. The building front doors and roof are opened when the <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> in use. The <b>telescope's</b> construction <b>was</b> finished in 1993. Along with the 12 Meter Telescope on Kitt Peak, this <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> maintained by the Arizona Radio Observatory, a division of Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{categories}} of <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> available from Tasco - Novice, Luminova, and Spacestation. Each family has several models. The Novice family features the most economical telescopes using manual focus and view finding, while {{the high end}} Spacestation utilizes fully automated sky-mapping, [...] "GoTo" [...] technology. Magnification ranges of the <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> advertised as between 25 and 675 power. Both reflecting telescopes and refracting <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> available in each category.|$|R
50|$|As well {{as using}} optical wavelengths, the {{observatory}} also has extensive radio astronomy capabilities. The largest radio <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> the 4.5m R.W. Forrest <b>telescope</b> which <b>is</b> used for receiving the 21cm Hydrogen line and continuum emission. A further three 3m radio <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> soon to operate {{together as a}} 115 metre baseline interferometer.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} completed, Lovell and Husband started contemplating {{the idea of}} upgrading the telescope so {{that it had a}} more accurate surface, and was controlled by a digital computer. Plans for this upgrade were created by Husband and Co., and were presented to Lovell in April 1964. Their plans became more urgent when fatigue cracks were discovered in the elevation drive system in September 1967. The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> only expected to have an operational lifespan of 10 years, and Husband had been warning about the decay of the telescope since 1963. The appearance of fatigue cracks was the first of these problems that threatened to stop the telescope working; if tey had not been put right, then the elevation system could have failed and perhaps jammed. The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> therefore repaired and upgraded to become the Mark IA; the £400,000 of funding to do this was announced on 8 July 1968 by the SRC. The upgrade was carried out in three phases, phase 1 lasting between September 1968 and February 1969, phase 2 between September and November 1969 and phase 3 between August 1970 and November 1971.|$|E
5|$|The Mark IA upgrade was {{formally}} completed on 16 July 1974, when the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> handed {{back to the}} University of Manchester. Due to increases {{in the cost of}} steel during the upgrade, the final amount for the upgrade was £664,793.07.|$|E
5|$|The Mark III <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> {{the same}} size as the Mark II, but was {{constructed}} to be transportable. However, it was never moved, and remained at its original site in Wardle, near Nantwich, where it was used as part of MERLIN. It was built in 1966, and was decommissioned in 1996.|$|E
50|$|Leuschner Observatory houses two optical telescopes, {{one with}} a 30 in {{diameter}} {{and the other with}} a 20 in diameter. As of 2010, the 20 in <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> not usable, and the 30 in <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> undergoing upgrades. The 30 in <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> of Ritchey-Chretien design, and is equipped with both a charge coupled device (CCD) for observations in visible light and an infrared detector that was fabricated in 2000 in order to create an infrared laboratory course for undergraduate students at UC Berkeley.

50|$|The Magellan <b>Telescopes</b> <b>are</b> {{a pair of}} 6.5 m (21.3 ft) {{diameter}} optical telescopes {{located at}} Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. The two <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> named after the astronomer Walter Baade and the philanthropist Landon T. Clay.|$|R
50|$|Because solar telescopes operate {{during the}} day, seeing is {{generally}} worse than for night-time telescopes, because {{the ground around}} the <b>telescope</b> <b>is</b> heated which causes turbulence and degrades the resolution. To alleviate this, solar <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> usually built on towers and the structures are painted white. The Dutch Open <b>Telescope</b> <b>is</b> built on an open framework to allow the wind {{to pass through the}} complete structure and provide cooling around the telescope's main mirror.|$|R
5|$|The WIYN Observatory's 3.5m <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> {{used for}} speckle imaging on June 18, 2010; in addition, the PHARO {{camera on the}} Palomar Observatory's 5m <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> used for its {{adaptive}} optics capabilities. These observations, combined with observations of Kepler-10's spectrum taken from the W.M. Keck Observatory, ruled {{out the possibility that}} a nearby star's light was corrupting the observed spectrum of Kepler-10 and creating the results that had led astronomers to believe that a second planet existed in Kepler-10's orbit. All of these possibilities, with the exception of if such a star existed exactly behind or in front of Kepler-10, were effectively ruled out; even with this, the Kepler team found that if a star was indeed aligned with Kepler-10 as seen from Earth, such a star would probably not be a giant star.|$|E
5|$|The <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> {{used as a}} {{follow-up}} instrument for possible SETI detections made at Arecibo between 1998 {{and the end of}} 2003. No signals were detected. In February 2005, astronomers using the Lovell Telescope discovered the galaxy VIRGOHI21 that appears to be made almost entirely of dark matter.|$|E
5|$|There {{were large}} cost overruns with the telescope's construction, mainly {{due to the}} steeply rising cost of steel {{at the time the}} <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> constructed. The {{original}} grant for the telescope's construction came jointly from the Nuffield Foundation and the government; this amounted to £335,000. The government increased its share of the funding several times as the cost of the telescope rose; other money came from private donations. The final part of the debt from the construction of the telescope, £50,000, was paid off by Lord Nuffield and the Nuffield Foundation on 25 May 1960 (partly due to the telescope's early, very public role in space probe tracking; see below), and Jodrell Bank observatory was renamed to the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories. The final total cost for the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> £700,000.|$|E
50|$|The first {{relatively}} large Schmidt <b>telescopes</b> <b>were</b> built at Hamburg Observatory and Palomar Observatory {{shortly before the}} Second World War. Between 1945 and 1980, about 8 more large (1 meter or larger) Schmidt <b>telescopes</b> <b>were</b> built around the world.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The MAGIC <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) {{located on}} the Canary island of La Palma. The <b>telescopes</b> <b>are</b> {{designed}} to measure Cherenkov light from air showers initiated by gamma rays in the energy regime from around 50 GeV to more than 50 TeV. The two <b>telescopes</b> <b>were</b> built in 2004 and 2009, respectively, with different cameras, triggers and readout systems. In the years 2011 - 2012 the MAGIC collaboration undertook a major upgrade to make the stereoscopic system uniform, improving its overall performance and easing its maintenance. In particular, the camera, the receivers and the trigger of the first <b>telescope</b> <b>were</b> replaced and the readout of the two <b>telescopes</b> <b>was</b> upgraded. This paper (Part I) describes {{the details of the}} upgrade as well as the basic performance parameters of MAGIC such as raw data treatment, linearity in the electronic chain and sources of noise. In Part II, we describe the physics performance of the upgraded system...|$|R
5|$|AMiBA was {{originally}} configured as a 7-element interferometer atop a hexapod mount. Observations at a wavelength of 3mm (86–102GHz) started in October 2006, and the detections of six clusters by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect were announced in 2008. In 2009 the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> upgraded to 13 elements, {{and it is}} capable of further expansion to 19 elements.

5|$|By the 1990s, the {{telescope}} surface was becoming badly corroded. In 2001–2003, the <b>telescope</b> <b>was</b> resurfaced, increasing its sensitivity at 5GHz {{by a factor}} of five. A holographic profiling technique was used on the surface, meaning that the surface works optimally at wavelengths of 5cm (compared to 18cm on the old surface). A new drive system was installed, which provides a much higher pointing accuracy. The outer track was relaid, and the focal tower was strengthened so that it could support heavier receivers.|$|E
