5|$|Though {{they did}} not need to deploy the amber, Walter realizes how close he was to making the same {{decisions}} that Walternate (Noble), Walter's doppelganger in the parallel universe, had to make to save his universe; Nina (Blair Brown) helps to counsel him. Meanwhile, Olivia and Peter attempt to reconcile and rekindle their relationship. Though still cautious about moving forward, Olivia and Peter kiss and head <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> upstairs at the Bishops' home.|$|E
5|$|Bamber's lawyers {{argued that}} images of Sheila {{taken by a}} police {{photographer}} at around 9am on 7 August 1985 showed her blood was still wet. According to the defence team, had she been killed before 3:30am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9am. They argue that she was alive when Bamber was standing outside {{the house with the}} police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> where she shot herself again, this time fatally.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> door, {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E
40|$|Field {{testing was}} {{performed}} in a retrofit unoccupied test house in Fresno, California. Three air-based heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) distribution systems - a typical airflow ducted system <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> a low airflow ducted system <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> and a system with no ductwork <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> - were evaluated during heating, cooling, and midseason conditions. The relative ability {{of each of the}} three systems was assessed with respect to relevant Air Conditioning Contractors of America (ACCA) and ASHRAE standards for house temperature uniformity and stability, respectively. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling also was performed and refined based on comparison to field test results <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> air flow rate into <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> of over-door and bottom-of-door air transfer grilles...|$|R

50|$|A broad {{flight of}} stairs led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{entrance}} of the mansion. There was a large and very lofty hall, which was similar to Leinster House in Dublin. The hall contained plaques and oil portraits. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> right on entering was the library. The drawing room had a southern aspect, and contained several portraits of the Rowley family. The state dining room was detached from the main block and had beautifully covered ceilings. The grand stairs led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms.</b> <b>The</b> handsome mantle in one of <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> was formally in a Dublin mansion.|$|R
5|$|While {{her mother}} attends the reunion, Emma visits Jordan at his hotel where she meets his teacher, Mr. Nystrom (Jeff Gruich). He takes {{her up to}} Jordan's hotel room but as they enter, Emma sees that it is {{completely}} empty except for a video camera which has been set up. She immediately becomes suspicious and tries to escape but Nystrom blocks her access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> door. She locks herself in the bathroom, and comes to the startling realization that Nystrom is Jordan. Nystrom apologizes and tells Emma he will let her go, but when she {{comes out of the}} bathroom he grabs and restrains her.|$|E

25|$|The {{northwest}} side {{can be broken}} down into three sections, each corresponding to the interior room it encloses. All the sections are plank construction with slab exterior. Each of the three sections contains a window. The first window looks into the bedroom and a double hung two-over-two sash measuring ten inches high by eight inches wide. The second window looks into the bathroom, and is identical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> window. The third window, looking into the kitchen, is a two-over-two casement measuring ten inches high by fourteen inches wide.|$|E
50|$|The Lincoln Sitting Room {{is a small}} {{sitting room}} located next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lincoln <b>Bedroom</b> on <b>the</b> {{second floor of the}} White House. It was used as the White House {{telegraph}} room from 1865 <b>to</b> 1902 (until <b>the</b> West Wing was built). It is furnished in Victorian-style <b>to</b> match <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> <b>The</b> overstuffed sofa and matching chair were formerly furnishings in the Green Room. The Kennedy restoration in 1963 restored it to Victorian-style, and it has been maintained in the same style since.|$|R

25|$|On Sonny and Brenda's wedding day, Sam {{got caught}} in an {{explosion}} meant for Brenda. Jason stayed by Sam's side when she was dealing with temporary hearing loss, even communicating in sign language to express his love. Jason decides to propose to Sam soon afterwards during a romantic dinner on the roof, and Sam accepts. Overwhelmed by the wedding planning, {{the two of them}} decide to drive off on Jason's motorcycle. They end up at a Chinese restaurant, where the owner happens to be an ordained minister. Jason and Sam get married in the restaurant's garden. They leave for their honeymoon to Hawaii, where Franco drugs them both, locks Jason in a room, and makes him watch while he takes Sam <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> and places her in bed, before turning off the camera. When Jason comes back to Sam, both of them come to believe Franco raped Sam.|$|E
25|$|When Corinna (wife) {{arrives with}} Mervyn {{it is clear}} that when we saw Nan in act 1, Jerome had {{modelled}} her on Corinna. In fact the actress who played Nan (the robot) in act 1 now plays Corinna (the wife) in act 2. Geain doesn't arrive at this point as she has gone to visit a shop first. We first see her on the video screen at the door to the flat. Because of her masculine hair and clothing Jerome initially mistakes her for a local hooligan, and she enters looking surly, unwashed and very unfeminine – in complete contrast to the delightful 9-year-old girl shown on screen in Act 1. This makes Jerome very upset. Nan/Zoe's child-minding programming kicks in and she takes Geain to the kitchen for a drink. When they return shortly afterwards Nan/Zoe has transformed Geain, who is now clean, feminine and wearing a night-dress. She is still uncooperative, but has already developed a degree of respect for Nan/Zoe who takes her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> to put her to bed.|$|E
25|$|While imprisoned, Hamilton Rowan met the Reverend William Jackson, an Irish-born Anglican clergyman who {{was working}} as a spy for the French Committee of Public Safety. Jackson's mission was to assess Ireland's {{readiness}} for revolution and French invasion. Jackson, Tone, and others met in Hamilton Rowan's Newgate cell to discuss the state of Ireland and the population's willingness to overthrow British rule. But Jackson was betrayed by a friend acting as a spy for the British Government, {{was arrested and charged with}} high treason. Immediately following Jackson's arrest, Hamilton Rowan fled to escape being tried for high treason. He convinced his jailer to allow him to visit his wife on the pretense of signing legal documents. While the jailer sat in the dining room of their home in Dublin, Hamilton Rowan excused himself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> where he climbed down a rope made of knotted bed sheets to a waiting horse. Unwilling to be taken alive, he kept a razor blade in his sleeve and fled south to the coast. There he hired a boat to sail to France, and upon his arrival he was immediately arrested as a British spy. While in prison he was interrogated by Robespierre, who found him innocent of the charges raised against him and had Hamilton Rowan freed.|$|E
50|$|Casa Jájome {{has been}} {{refurbished}} {{and become a}} comfortable residence with modern furnishings, expanded to include a dining room and den, in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> bathrooms, kitchen and living room located in the original structure, and a multi-level terraced garden has been developed. Damaged by Hurricane Georges in 1998, it was remodeled under the Sila Calderón administration between 2001-2004. Across Jájome Road, a two-story structure houses a security detail, <b>the</b> entranceway <b>to</b> a large gazebo and other facilities.|$|R
50|$|Behind {{one of the}} {{galleries}} is a passage that leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> in <b>the</b> State Apartments. This {{was used by the}} Lord Lieutenant and his entourage when they were staying at the Castle during inclement weather. His pew (or throne) was in the centre of the right-hand gallery. Directly facing him was the place for the bishop. It might seem as no co-incidence that Lord Whitworth's arms appear directly at the Lord-Lieutenant's position, a most prominent spot.|$|R
50|$|Floors are {{timber and}} {{appear to have been}} sanded and sealed with a {{polyurethane}} finish. Bedroom floors have been carpeted. The kitchen and bathrooms have recent vinyl sheet coverings. Walls are generally plastered and painted. Ceilings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> appear <b>to</b> be original plaster board with rounded cover strips and moulded cornices. The living/dining area appears to have a recent plasterboard ceiling. The passage and entrance area has a recent lowered ceiling to accommodate air conditioning ducting.|$|R
25|$|Another {{factor is}} the level of privacy to which a person can be assured - for example, some parts of a home may be seen from the outside or there may be a {{possibility}} of others walking in. The expectation of privacy may be confined to the home and sometimes the backyard. Inside the home, it may be restricted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> or just the bathroom. If a person is not alone, their comfort in removing clothing in front of another person will generally depend on the nature of a relationship of those who jointly occupy the same private space, as well as the attitudes of others to nudity. Besides the nature of a relationship, attitudes and incidences of nudity will also depend on the level of inhibition that each person has, as well as the level of privacy to which that they can be assured. Sometimes a person may unintentionally intrude on a person who is in the nude, which may lead to embarrassment of {{one or both of the}} people. The nude person may seek to quickly cover their private parts, while the clothed person may turn away, but this also depends on cultural differences and the relationship of the people.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, the Skinkers found {{a man in}} London {{willing to}} marry Tannakin. On {{the day of the}} wedding, and despite all efforts to improve her appearance, her face was as pig-like as ever. With the wedding service concluded, the newly-wed couple retired <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> When they lay in bed {{together}} for the first time, Tannakin reached for her husband's arm, saying that she would release him from his vows provided that he would look at her in the face. He turned to look at her, and saw [...] "a sweet young Lady of incomparable beauty and feature, the like to whom to his imagination he never had in his whole life time beheld". He reached to kiss her, but she refused, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|Hughes then {{phoned the}} police {{and told them that}} Evans was confused, had a rifle, and was on valium. Four policemen arrived and three of them, David D. Krempa, Robert E. Brannon and Lieutenant Higbie, went up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> They later {{reported}} that as soon as Evans saw the three policemen he pointed a rifle at them. The officers repeatedly told Evans to put down the rifle (which they did not know at the time was an air rifle) but Evans constantly refused. The police fired six shots, four hitting Evans and killing him. Evans had previously been awarded the badge of [...] "Honorary Sheriff of Los Angeles County", but in the Los Angeles Times, he was referred to as a “jobless former road manager for the Beatles”.|$|E

50|$|A zone damper (also {{known as}} a Volume Control Damper or VCD) is a {{specific}} type of damper used <b>to</b> control <b>the</b> flow of air in an HVAC heating or cooling system. In order to improve efficiency and occupant comfort, HVAC systems are commonly divided up into multiple zones. For example, in a house, the main floor may be served by one heating zone while <b>the</b> upstairs <b>bedrooms</b> are served by another. In this way, the heat can be directed principally <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main floor during the day and principally <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> at night, allowing <b>the</b> unoccupied areas <b>to</b> cool down.|$|R
5|$|A similar {{situation}} arose outside the apartment. A crowd {{gathered by the}} front door of 5A, including next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> children's <b>bedroom</b> window—through which an abductor may have entered or left—trampling on evidence. An officer dusted <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> window's exterior shutter for fingerprints without wearing gloves or other protective clothing.|$|R
500|$|As {{the song}} begins, Brown watches a woman, who {{appears as a}} hologram, lying in a bed. This scene is intercut with scenes of Brown singing {{in front of a}} flowing backdrop. He then {{approaches}} the woman, and together they appear under white bedsheets. Brown is then seen walking down a street, while women are shown levitating out of their beds as he passes by them. He then enters a limo and starts caressing various ghostlike female figures. Brown then returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom</b> where he [...] "strips shirtless and makes passionate love" [...] to the woman [...] "as they are showered in water". He later enters a dance studio, where he performs a dance routine with other shirtless male dancers, while several women watch them from across the room. Towards the end of the video, more scenes are shown of Brown and the woman in the bedroom.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} notorious and widely {{condemned}} scenes in Gone with the Wind depicts what is now legally defined as [...] "marital rape". The scene begins with Scarlett and Rhett {{at the bottom of the}} staircase, where he begins to kiss her, refusing to be told 'no' by the struggling and frightened Scarlett; Rhett overcomes her resistance and carries her up the stairs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom,</b> where the audience is left in no doubt that she will [...] "get what's coming to her". The next scene, the following morning, shows Scarlett glowing with barely suppressed sexual satisfaction; Rhett apologizes for his behavior, blaming it on his drinking. The scene has been accused of combining romance and rape by making them indistinguishable from each other, and of reinforcing a notion about forced sex: that women secretly enjoy it, and it is an acceptable way for a man to treat his wife.|$|E
500|$|As {{they are}} {{watching}} TV in Jerry's apartment, Jerry and Elaine flip through the channels, stumbling upon the soft-core pornography channel. Upon {{the realization that}} neither of them has had sexual relations in a while, they start toying {{with the idea of}} sleeping together. They refer to their friendship as [...] "this" [...] and sexual intercourse as [...] "that". However, as they do not wish to ruin their friendship, they establish a set of ground rules. Happy with their agreement, they make their way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedroom.</b> The next day Jerry has lunch with his friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), and makes him aware of his situation with Elaine. George remains skeptical, even after Jerry explains the rules system to him. He is proven right when Jerry and Elaine get into an argument over the second rule: [...] "Spending the night is optional". Jerry eventually does not spend the night, leaving their agreement on shaky terms.|$|E

50|$|Entering {{the front}} of the castle through a large porch (above which is the Home of Wedderburn coat of arms), there is a double {{staircase}} with an iron balustrade leading up to a balcony, behind which is a long gallery connecting the drawing room and the dining room. Across the hall and above the front door is a long minstrel gallery, again connecting the drawing room and the dining room. On the right of the staircase are the drawing room, and the morning room (previously the smoking room), beyond which is the ballroom. There are several fine chimneypieces, the best being by Piranesi. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> left are the dining room, and a further staircase leading up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms.</b> <b>The</b> ground floor has a large kitchen and further bedrooms, originally for servants.|$|R
5|$|Mrs Smith's Cottage is a {{mid-19th century}} Grade II listed {{building}} made from early Victorian red bricks. The range, {{the heart of}} the house, was in daily use for cooking and heating until the mid-1990s. <b>The</b> only access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bedrooms</b> is by a ladder. Electricity was installed in the 1930s, and the only other visible modern innovations are the coldwater tap – installed <b>to</b> prevent <b>the</b> local council condemning the cottage in the late 1970s – and an inside toilet. The original outside privy and washhouse can still be viewed.|$|R
