5|$|Despite many {{media and}} {{government}} {{claims to the}} contrary, Caroline Island {{was not the first}} point of land to see sunrise on January 1, 2000 (local time); that distinction belongs <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> land between Dibble Glacier and Victor Bay on the coast of East Antarctica, at , where the sun rose 35 minutes earlier. As this point is close to the Antarctic Circle, and the area beyond the Antarctic Circle is affected by the continuous sunlight in December, the definition of the exact point becomes a question of distinguishing between a sunset and an immediate sunrise in view of atmospheric refraction effects.|$|E
5|$|In November 1941, Schnaufer {{was posted}} to the II. Gruppe of Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (II./NJG1—2nd {{group of the}} 1st Night Fighter Wing) at the time based at Stade near Hamburg. Here, Schnaufer was {{assigned}} to the 5. Staffel (5./NJG1—5th squadron of 1st Night Fighter Wing). The Bf 110's of II./NJG1 at the time were not equipped with airborne radar such as the Lichtenstein radar. Night fighter intercept tactics had matured since their early beginnings in July 1940, and II. Gruppe had already been credited with 397 victories. Missions against enemy bombers at the time were usually flown by means of ground-controlled interception, although the Luftwaffe was already experimenting with airborne radar. This air defence system, consisting of a series of radar stations with overlapping coverage, layered three deep, was conceived by Generalleutnant (lit. Lieutenant General; equivalent to Major General) Josef Kammhuber and was organised in the so-called Kammhuber Line. Conceptually, the system was based on a combination of ground-based radar stations, search lights and a Jägerleitoffizier (fighter pilot control officer). The Jägerleitoffizier had to vector the airborne night fighter by means of radio communication <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> visual interception of the illuminated bomber. These interception tactics were referred to as the Himmelbett (canopy bed) procedure.|$|E

25|$|The same is true, up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>point,</b> <b>of</b> the {{chemical}} reactions of living things. They are usually catalyzed by enzymes which change reaction rates, {{but with no}} variation in catalytic action, {{the rule of thumb}} is still mostly applicable. In the case of bacteria and fungi, the reactions needed to feed and reproduce speed up at higher temperatures, up {{to the point that the}} proteins and other compounds in their cells themselves begin to break down, or denature, so quickly that they cannot be replaced. This is why high temperatures kill bacteria and other micro-organisms: 'tissue' breakdown reactions reach such rates that they cannot be compensated for and the cell dies. On the other hand, 'elevated' temperatures short of these result in increased growth and reproduction; if the organism is harmful, perhaps to dangerous levels.|$|E

The title is taken from a poem by Harlem Renaissance poet Georgia Douglas Johnson, which connects Angelou with other female African-American writers. African-American literature critic Lyman B. Hagen states, [...] "Faithful to the ongoing themes of survival, sense of self, and continuing education, The Heart of a Woman moves its central figures <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> full personhood".

500|$|Critics gave {{positive}} reviews {{towards the}} overall gameplay mechanics, although they often presented some reservations. Several reviews praised {{the simplicity of}} the game interface. Andre Thomas of GamePlasma described the game's learning curve as [...] "incredibly simple" [...] and the gameplay mechanics as logical extension of those from the adventure games of the 1990s, while GamingTrend reviewer Ron Burke praised Telltale's [...] "intuitive" [...] point-and-click system. Mark Smith of Game Chronicles, however, stated that the streamlined mechanics eliminated [...] "a lot of the exploration and discovery we normally associate with these types of games". Some reviews directed criticism towards puzzle design; according to Smith, the game is [...] "certainly accessible to kids and younger teens", but the adult audience [...] "will find these games way too easy". Reviewing for Adventure Gamers, Evan Dickens felt that the puzzles took [...] "a bit of thought and consideration, but never <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> consternation", believing that the low difficulty was intended by Telltale to allow players to [...] "proceed through the story with minimum frustration". Hypers Tim Henderson commends the game for being [...] "highly accessible [...] almost as funny as the original". However, he criticises it for its episodic content being a [...] "tease".|$|E
500|$|During the 1850s, Emily's {{strongest and}} most affectionate {{relationship}} {{was with her}} sister-in-law, Susan Gilbert. Emily eventually sent her over three hundred letters, more than to any other correspondent, {{over the course of}} their friendship. Susan was supportive of the poet, playing the role of [...] "most beloved friend, influence, muse, and adviser" [...] whose editorial suggestions Dickinson sometimes followed, Sue played a primary role in Emily's creative processes." [...] Sue married Austin in 1856 after a four-year courtship, though their marriage was not a happy one. Edward Dickinson built a house for Austin and Sue naming it the Evergreens, a stand of which was located {{on the west side of}} the Homestead. There is controversy over how to view Emily's friendship with Susan; according <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view first promoted by Mabel Loomis Todd, Austin's longtime mistress, Emily's missives typically dealt with demands for Sue's affection and the fear of unrequited admiration. Todd believed that because Sue was often aloof and disagreeable, Emily was continually hurt by what was mostly a tempestuous friendship. However, the notion of a [...] "cruel" [...] Susan—as promoted by her romantic rival—has been questioned, most especially by Sue and Austin's surviving children, with whom Emily was close.|$|E

One of the more [...] "authentic" [...] ones was the production by the Boston Ideal Opera Company, which was first formed to produce Pinafore. It engaged well-regarded concert singers and opened on 14 April 1879 at the 3,000-seat Boston Theatre. The critics agreed that the company fulfilled its goals of presenting an [...] "ideal" [...] production. The Boston Journal reported that the audience was [...] "wrought up by the entertainment <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> absolute approval". The paper observed that {{it is a mistake to}} consider Pinafore a burlesque, [...] "for while irresistibly comical it is not bouffe and requires to be handled with great care lest its delicate proportions be marred and its subtle quality of humor be lost". The Journal described the opera as [...] "classical" [...] in method and wrote that its [...] "most exquisite satire" [...] lay in its [...] "imitation of the absurdities" [...] of grand opera. The company went on to become one of the most successful touring companies in America. The first children's version in Boston became a sensation with both children and adult audiences, extending its run through the summer of 1879. The Boston Herald wrote that [...] "the large audience of children and their elders went fairly wild with delight... shrieks of laughter were repeatedly heard".|$|E
