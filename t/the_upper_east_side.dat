5|$|Early {{on in the}} project, it was {{announced}} that the new stations would feature platform screen doors. The stations (along with the new South Ferry station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and the three Phase 1 Second Avenue Subway stations in <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side)</b> would include special air-cooling systems to reduce the temperature along platforms. Due to its depth, the extension has ventilation towers, rather than the ventilation grates ubiquitous {{in the rest of the}} subway system.|$|E

5|$|The film's premise was {{inspired}} by a French couple in an open marriage whom Levin met in the 1980s. Though he completed the film's first draft in 2007, the project remained in development for seven further years due to casting issues. Diane Kruger was initially cast as Arielle but was replaced by Marlohe. Filming began in May 2013 in New York City and mainly took place on <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> of Manhattan. The film's score was composed by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans.|$|E
5000|$|Blair takes {{matters into}} her own hands to help Serena deal with the {{manipulative}} and evil Georgina Sparks who threatens to expose Serena's secret. Lily, while keeping Rufus in her mind, prepares for her wedding with Bart Bass {{that is designed to}} be <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side's</b> social event of the year. Serena finally tells Dan the whole truth about her past and about Georgina and they try to work things out. But Dan is guilt-ridden after having cheated on Serena with Georgina and wonders if it is already too late. An unexpected guest shows up at Lily and Bart's wedding. Also Blair manipulates matters so that Georgina goes [...] "somewhere where she can do no harm". As {{the end of the school}} year approaches, Blair plans to go somewhere with Chuck.|$|R
50|$|Development of <b>the</b> future <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> {{began in}} <b>the</b> early 1860s with the {{construction}} of rowhouses for middle and working class buyers on the cross streets several blocks east of Central Park.

5|$|In April 1960, Roosevelt was {{diagnosed}} with aplastic anemia soon after being struck by a car in New York City. In 1962, she was given steroids, which activated a dormant case of tuberculosis in her bone marrow, and she died of resulting cardiac failure at her Manhattan home at 55 East 74th Street on <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> on November 7, 1962, {{at the age of}} 78. Her daughter Anna took care of Roosevelt when she was terminally ill in 1962. President John F.

5|$|Many private preparatory {{schools are}} also {{situated}} in Manhattan, including the Upper East Side's Brearley School, Dalton School, Browning School, Spence School, Chapin School, Nightingale-Bamford School, Convent of the Sacred Heart, Hewitt School, Saint David's School, and Loyola School, {{along with the}} Upper West Side's Collegiate School and Trinity School. Regis High School, on <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side,</b> is the only all-scholarship Catholic high school for boys in the country. The borough {{is also home to}} two private schools that are known as the most diverse in the nation, Manhattan Country School and United Nations International School. Manhattan has the only official Italian American school in the U.S., La Scuola d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{unification}} of the three subway companies that comprised the New York City Subway in 1940, elevated lines were being shut down {{all over the city}} and replaced by subways. The northern half of the Second Avenue Elevated, serving <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> and East Harlem, closed on June 11, 1940; the southern half, running through Lower Manhattan, East Midtown and across the Queensborough Bridge to Queens, closed on June 13, 1942. The demolition of the Second Avenue elevated caused overcrowding on the Astoria and Flushing Lines in Queens, which no longer had direct service to Manhattan's far East Side. Because of the elevated line's closure, as well as a corresponding increase in the East Side's population, the need for a Second Avenue subway increased.|$|E
50|$|Garvin {{was born}} in New York City to Jacques and Margarita Garvin. In 1962, he {{received}} a Bachelor of Arts degree in Architecture from Yale College and later both a Masters in Architecture and a Masters in Urban Studies from the Yale School of Architecture in 1967. He resides in New York on <b>the</b> city's <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side,</b> where he has lived {{for most of his}} life.|$|R
5000|$|Construction of the Third Avenue El, opened from 1878 in sections, {{followed}} by the Second Avenue El, opened in 1879, linked <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side's</b> middle class and skilled artisans closely {{to the heart of}} the city, and confirmed the modest nature of the area to their east. The ghostly [...] "Hamilton Square", which had appeared as one of the few genteel interruptions of the grid plan on city maps since the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, was intended to straddle what had now become the Harlem Railroad right-of-way between 66th and 69th Streets; it never materialized, though during the Panic of 1857 its unleveled ground was the scene of an open-air mass meeting called in July to agitate for the secession of the city and its neighboring counties from New York State, and the city divided its acreage into house lots and sold them. From the 1880s the neighborhood of Yorkville became a suburb of middle-class Germans.|$|R
5000|$|In Providence, Rhode Island, Robert Blake, a young {{writer with}} an {{interest}} in the occult, becomes fascinated by a large disused church on Federal Hill which he can see from his lodgings on <b>the</b> city's <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>side.</b> His researches reveal that the church has a sinister history involving a cult called the Church of Starry Wisdom and is dreaded by the local migrant inhabitants as being haunted by a primeval evil.|$|R
5|$|Business {{declined}} {{during the}} construction and blasting of the station, with many storefronts losing business and some even being forced to close. However, starting in 2013, construction of the station has caused the value of real estate {{in the area to}} start to rise. Although the surrounding area's real estate prices had been declining since the 1990s, there had been increases in the purchases and leases of residential units around the area, causing real estate prices to rise again. On <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side,</b> prices of real estate west of Third Avenue had historically been higher than prices east of there, but due to the subway's construction, prices of real estate east of the avenue had risen dramatically since the station's construction started. With the opening of the new station, business owners hoped to see an increase in patronage.|$|E
5|$|After {{discovering}} that Charlie {{has not been}} taking her medication, Serena and Vanessa reluctantly team up to find her. Chuck, Nate, Vanessa, and Serena soon encircle Dan, exclaiming that they need something from him. Chuck asks him where Blair is while Serena and Vanessa ask for Charlie's whereabouts. One of Blair's old friends reveals that Blair left the party. While accompanying Chuck to their apartment to look for Blair, Nate confesses that he told Raina (Tika Sumpter) everything behind her mother's death. Chuck reprimands Nate until Raina interrupts them to apologize. Blair is held hostage by Russell in Chuck's hotel. Pretending to escape, she calls Chuck on her phone, revealing her location. Russell explains his reason for kidnapping Blair: to burn down the hotel with her in it. A drunk Charlie is seen dancing wildly until Dan confronts her, but she escapes. Serena greets Headmistress Queller (Jan Maxwell), who expresses her concern with Serena's choice of staying in New York City, having hoped that Serena would find her place outside of <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side.</b> Georgina offers her aid in their scheme but Dan, Vanessa, and Serena reject her help, going their separate ways to find Charlie.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to connecting the BMT Nassau Street and IND Sixth Avenue Lines, {{as well as}} the Sixth Avenue Line to the Manhattan Bridge, the Chrystie Street Connection {{is one of the few}} completed sections of the SAS. The Grand Street station was built to serve as a transfer point between the Sixth Avenue and Second Avenue lines. The connection was built this way because the original 1960s plans for the SAS had Second Avenue and Sixth Avenue Line trains sharing two island platforms in a four-track layout, with connections from the Second Avenue Line to the Sixth Avenue Line and the Manhattan Bridge. Because Second Avenue Subway construction was halted in 1975, this station has only served Sixth Avenue Line trains since its opening. As part of the contemporary Second Avenue Subway construction, a new station is planned for construction below the current station during the fourth and final phase of the project; Phase 1 of the project on <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> opened on January 1, 2017, with Phase 2 in planning and two other phases with no funding commitments.|$|E
5000|$|On October 13, 2009, The Hollywood Reporter {{stated that}} Sherman-Palladino had been signed {{to write and}} {{executive}} produce an as yet untitled drama series for HBO. The series would [...] "chronicle the complicated relationship among three adult sisters, all writers sharing <b>the</b> same <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> apartment building, and their mother, a domineering literary lioness who reserves most of her affections for their ne'er-do-well brother." [...] No news on the project has emerged since then.|$|R
50|$|After {{attending}} the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, {{where she was}} a contemporary of Aaron Copland among others, Berckman spent the 1930s in New York City, living in East 60th Street on <b>the</b> city's <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side.</b> She worked as a piano teacher, and as a pianist and composer, before this career was curtailed by paralysis brought on by arduous sessions of piano practice. Her compositions were performed, amongst others by the Pro Arte Quartet and the Philadelphia Orchestra.|$|R

It premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. Kravitz starred as Evie Wallace, a high school sex columnist, in the teen comedy Beware the Gonzo. The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2010.|$|R
5|$|On December 19, 2001, the Federal Transit Administration {{approved}} {{the start of}} preliminary engineering on a full-length Second Avenue Subway. The MTA's final environmental impact statement (FEIS) was approved in April 2004; this latest proposal is for a two-track line from 125th Street and Lexington Avenue in Harlem, down Second Avenue to Hanover Square in the Financial District. The final plan called for the full-length Second Avenue line to carry two services: the T, with a route emblem colored , {{as well as a}} rerouted Q train. Phase 1 rerouted the Q, the Broadway Express via the BMT 63rd Street Line and north along Second Avenue, to <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> at 96th Street. Phase 2 will extend the rerouted Q train to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue. In Phase Three, the new T train will run from 125th Street to Houston Street. The final phase will extend T train service from Houston Street to Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|With the city's {{economic}} and budgetary {{recovery in the}} 1990s, there was a revival of efforts to complete construction of the SAS. Rising ridership on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, the only subway trunk line east of Central Park, demonstrated {{the need for the}} Second Avenue Line, as capacity and safety concerns rose. The four-track IRT Lexington Avenue Line, the lone rapid transit option in <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> and East Harlem since the 1955 closure of the Third Avenue elevated, is the most crowded subway line in the country. The line saw an average of 1.3 million daily riders in 2015; this is more than the daily ridership of the second-busiest subway system in the U.S., the Washington Metro, as well as more than the combined daily riderships of San Francisco's and Boston's transit systems. Local bus routes are just as crowded during various times of the day, with the paralle M15 local and M15 Select Bus Service routes seeing 46,000 passengers per weekday in 2016, translating to 14.5 million passengers yhat year.|$|E
5|$|After the IND Sixth Avenue Line was {{completed}} in 1940, the city went into great debt, and only 33 new stations {{have been added to}} the system since, nineteen of which were part of defunct railways that already existed. Five stations were on the abandoned New York, Westchester and Boston Railway, which was incorporated into the system in 1941 as the IRT Dyre Avenue Line. Fourteen more stations were on the abandoned LIRR Rockaway Beach Branch (now the IND Rockaway Line), which opened in 1955. Two stations (57th Street and Grand Street) were part of the Chrystie Street Connection, and opened in 1968; the Harlem–148th Street terminal opened that same year in an unrelated project. Six were built as part of a 1968 plan: three on the Archer Avenue Lines, opened in 1988, and three on the 63rd Street Lines, built in 1989. The new South Ferry station was built and connected to the existing Whitehall Street–South Ferry station in 2009. The one-stop 7 Subway Extension to the west side of Manhattan, comprising the 34th Street–Hudson Yards station, was opened in 2015, and three stations on the Second Avenue Subway in <b>the</b> <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> were opened in the beginning of 2017.|$|E
5000|$|Four years later, {{after she}} and Viazzi split up, Elaine bought a {{restaurant}} in <b>the</b> Manhattan's <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side,</b> and Elaine's was born. Despite the location - not popular at the time - many customers from Portofino followed her to the new spot. Her original intent was that the restaurant would be a writer's dive, incubating authors. [...] Over the years, Kaufman bought the entire building that housed the restaurant, {{as well as the}} building next door. The rental income subsidized the restaurant in lean years. Kaufman was designated a living landmark by the New York Landmarks Conservancy in 2003.|$|R
50|$|The bar {{scene in}} the opening was filmed at Julius in Greenwich Village. Studio shots were at the Chelsea Studios in New York City. According to {{commentary}} by Friedkin on the 2008 DVD release, Michael's apartment was inspired by <b>the</b> real-life <b>Upper</b> <b>East</b> <b>Side</b> apartment of actress Tammy Grimes. (Grimes was a personal friend of Mart Crowley.) Most of the patio scenes were filmed at Grimes' home. The actual apartment interior would not allow for filming, given its size and other technical factors, so a replica of Grimes' apartment {{was built on the}} Chelsea Studios sound stage, and that is where the interior scenes were filmed.|$|R
