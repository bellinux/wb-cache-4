5|$|Japanese voice {{recording}} {{for the game}} began two years before its release in 2008. Several voice actors had worked on other tri-Ace titles in the past. Beyond merely being given directions for their performances, the actors were able {{to contribute to the}} characters' personalities. Many characters were revised based on suggestions given by their voice actors during recording. The cast enjoyed their experience, as the game gave them <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> large range of performances, from comedic to dramatic scenes. Overall, the production process for both actors and development staff was a positive one. The English {{voice recording}} began in August 2009 under the supervision of Sega. Recording took place at studios in Los Angeles, and was overseen by Shimano and Suguro. Speaking about his view of the three main actors, Shimano was impressed, praising DiCocco's range and expression for Leanne and noting Menville's performances as Zephyr required fewer retakes than other actors.|$|E
5|$|Low {{challenged}} the Prime Minister over the Suez issue, {{accusing him of}} sending a threatening telegram that caused British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to back off the invasion and so gave the Soviets <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> military buildup in Egypt. St. Laurent angrily denied the charge and offered to open his correspondence {{to any of the}} fifty privy councillors who could then announce whether St. Laurent was telling the truth. Low took St. Laurent up on his challenge, and selected the only living former Prime Minister, Tory Arthur Meighen, but the matter was not resolved before the election, and Meighen was not called upon to examine the correspondence in the election's aftermath.|$|E

5|$|One Foot used Bournemouth to film some {{exterior}} sequences {{because of}} its favourable climate, easy access to London, and economical benefits relative to filming in the capital. After the first series was filmed, the housenear Pokesdown, Bournemouthwhich had been used for the Meldrews' house in location sequences, changed hands and the new owners demanded nearly treble the usage fees that the previous owners had asked for. Rather than agree to this, the production team decided {{to find a new}} house, and the first episode of the second series was rewritten to have the Meldrews' house destroyed in a fire (Filmed on waste ground in Northcote Road, Springbourne). This also gave <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new interior set to be designed, as Belbin had been unhappy with the original set designed for the series, which she felt was too restrictive to shoot in.|$|E
5|$|The Ottomans first landed 15 {{miles west}} of Canea (Chania), where the local militia fled before them. They then {{attacked}} the small island fortress of St. Todero, the commander of which, the Istrian Blasio Zulian, blew himself, the fortress and its garrison up rather than let it fall to the Ottomans. The Ottoman army next advanced {{to the city of}} Canea itself, which fell on 22 August, after a siege that lasted for 56 days. At the same time, however, the Venetians were strengthened, as the promised help started to arrive in the form of galleys from the Papal States, Tuscany, Malta and Naples. In September, the Ottoman fleet was in disarray, but the allied Christian fleet, under the cautious command of Niccolò Ludovisi, the Pope's nephew, failed to exploit <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> decisive strike. When the Christian forces finally moved to retake Canea on 1 October, with a fleet of about 90 ships, the stout Ottoman defense and the Allies' lack of cooperation doomed the attack. Soon thereafter, the Venetian allies returned to their bases.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, as {{the allied}} Christian fleet resumed operations, it faced a renewed Ottoman navy of 200 vessels under Kılıç Ali Pasha. The Spanish contingent under Don John {{did not reach}} the Ionian Sea until September, meaning that the Ottomans enjoyed numerical superiority for a time, but the Ottoman commander {{was well aware of}} the inferiority of his fleet, constructed in haste of green wood and manned by inexperienced crews. He therefore actively avoided to engage the allied fleet in August, and eventually headed {{for the safety of the}} fortress of Modon. The arrival of the Spanish squadron of 55 ships evened the numbers on both sides and opened <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> decisive blow, but friction among the Christian leaders and the reluctance of Don John squandered the opportunity.|$|E

5|$|When Michael II died in c. 1268, however, his realm was divided, with Nikephoros {{receiving}} the metropolitan territories of Epirus proper and John {{taking over the}} Epirote domains in Thessaly and Central Greece. According to Gregoras, his realm extended from Mount Olympus in the north to Parnassus in the south, with the Achelous River serving as his border with Epirus proper; his capital was at Neopatras. Michael VIII seized <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rapprochement with the two brothers.

25|$|The plot of {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of Hitchhiker's Guide differs widely {{from that of the}} radio show, book and television series. The romantic triangle between Arthur, Zaphod, and Trillian is more prominent in the film; and visits to Vogsphere, the homeworld of the Vogons (which, in the books, was already abandoned), and Viltvodle VI are inserted. The film covers roughly events in the first four radio episodes, and ends with the characters en route to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, leaving <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sequel open.

Ultimately, Chinese reluctance may have been beneficial to Nepalese interests, allowing the government to showcase improved local hospitals and <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new hybrid aviation/mountaneering stylewhich sparked conversations about helicopter use in the mountaineering world.

25|$|Now, however, with {{legitimacy}} being {{extended to}} non-state actors, {{as well as}} <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minority to secede from a given state and form a new country {{there has been a}} dramatic shift in the international status quo. Moreover, the international community's model for conflict resolution is heavily influenced by academic thought developed in western countries. This model encourages intervening in civil wars in order to stop political violence and come to a negotiated settlement which often involves democratising efforts. Critics such as Christopher Clapham and David Shearer, argue that this intervention can provide mechanisms for continued conflict {{to the detriment of the}} civilian population. Clapham's argument is principally in relation to the situation in Rwanda leading up to the genocide, whereas Shearer focuses on the negative aspects of intervention, primarily regarding Sierra Leone, which prevents total victory by one side and results in the creation of asymmetries between belligerents which opens the door for continued bloodshed.|$|E
25|$|The British side also {{suffered}} from poor communications, with ships failing to report {{engagement with the}} enemy to each other. The initial failure to include Jellicoe in planning the raid could have led to disaster had he not sent reinforcements, although the subsequent communications failures which meant British ships were unaware of the new arrivals could then have led to British ships attacking each other. There {{was no way to}} warn off British submarines which might have targeted their own ships. It had been the decision of Admiral Sturdee—Admiralty Chief of Staff—not to inform Jellicoe and also not to send additional larger ships which had originally been requested by Keyes. Jellicoe in effect countermanded this decision once he knew of the raid by sending ships which were part of his command. Keyes was disappointed that <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> greater success had been lost by not including the additional cruisers properly into the plan as he had originally intended. Jellicoe was disturbed by the Admiralty failure to discuss the raid with their {{commander in chief of the}} fleet at sea.|$|E
