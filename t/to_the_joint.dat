40|$|Compression {{parallel}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bed <b>joint</b> occurs due to flexure in masonry beam elements. Currently, it {{is believed}} that there is a reduction in the compressive strength of masonry when it is loaded parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bed <b>joint.</b> It is also believed that this reduction is larger when the webs of the blocks are present in the compression zone, causing an interruption in the grout. This study was undertaken <b>to</b> investigate <b>the</b> effect of loading parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bed <b>joint,</b> as well as web interruption, on the concrete masonry compressive strength. A detailed experimental study using 29 prism and 12 beam specimens was completed. It was found that the compressive strength parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bed <b>joint</b> reduces as web interruption increases. However, the compressive strength parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bed <b>joint</b> is higher than the compressive strength normal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bed <b>joint</b> which contradicts current belief...|$|R

Halsey was summoned to MacArthur's headquarters in Brisbane on 3March 1944, and the two agreed to a compromise.

40|$|Muscles are {{significant}} contributors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> high <b>joint</b> forces {{developed in the}} knee during human walking. Not only do muscles contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> knee <b>joint</b> forces by acting <b>to</b> compress <b>the</b> <b>joint,</b> but they also develop joint forces indirectly through their contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground reaction forces via dynamic coupling. Thus, muscles can have significant contributions to forces at joints they do not span. However, few studies have investigated how the major lower-limb muscles contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> knee <b>joint</b> contact forces during walking. The goal {{of this study was}} to use a muscle-actuated forward dynamics simulation of walking to identify how individual muscles contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> axial tibio-femoral <b>joint</b> force. <b>The</b> simulation results showed that the vastii muscles are <b>the</b> primary contributors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> axial <b>joint</b> force in early stance while the gastrocnemius is the primary contributor in late stance. <b>The</b> tibio-femoral <b>joint</b> force generated by these muscles was at times greater than the muscle forces themselves. Muscles that do not cross <b>the</b> knee <b>joint</b> (e. g., <b>the</b> gluteus maximus and soleus) also have significant contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tibio-femoral <b>joint</b> force through their contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground reaction forces. Further, small changes in walking kinematics (e. g., knee flexion angle) can have a significant effect on the magnitude of <b>the</b> knee <b>joint</b> forces. Thus, altering walking mechanics and muscle coordination patterns to utilize muscle groups that perform the same biomechanical function, yet contribute less <b>to</b> <b>the</b> knee <b>joint</b> forces may be an effective way to reduce knee joint loading during walking...|$|R
