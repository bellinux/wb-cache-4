The absorption wing profiles are often fitted using the Voigt function {{due to the fact}} that the scattering <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> near resonant line center is approximately described by the Lorentzian function.

40|$|The strong {{variability}} of blazars {{can be characterized}} by power spectral densities (PSDs) and Fourier frequency-dependent time lags. In previous work, we created a new theoretical formalism for describing the PSDs and time lags produced via a combination of stochastic particle injection and emission via the synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton, and external Compton (EC) processes. This formalism used the <b>Thomson</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> and simple δ-function approximations to model the synchrotron and Compton emissivities. Here we expand upon this work, using the full Compton cross section and detailed and accurate emissivities. Our results indicate good agreement between the PSDs computed using the δ-function approximations and those computed using the accurate expressions, provided the observed photons are produced primarily by electrons with energies exceeding the lower limit of the injected particle population.

40|$|The {{influence}} of finite relaxation times on Thomson scattering from warm-dense plasmas is examined {{within the framework}} of the average-atom approximation. Presently most calculations use the collision-free Lindhard dielectric function to evaluate the free-electron contribution to the <b>Thomson</b> <b>cross</b> <b>section.</b> In this work, we use the Mermin dielectric function, which includes relaxation time explicitly. The relaxation time is evaluated by treating the average atom as an impurity in a uniform electron gas and depends critically on the transport cross section. The calculated relaxation rates agree well with values inferred from the Ziman formula for the static conductivity and also with rates inferred from a fit to the frequency-dependent conductivity. Transport cross sections determined by the phase-shift analysis in the average-atom potential are compared with those evaluated in the commonly used Born approximation. The Born approximation converges to the exact cross sections at high energies; however, differences that occur at low energies lead to corresponding differences in relaxation rates. The relative importance of including relaxation time when modeling X-ray Thomson scattering spectra is examined by comparing calculations of the free-electron dynamic structure function for Thomson scattering using Lindhard and Mermin dielectric functions.

The asymmetric deviation of the scattering <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> from the Lorentzian near the line center is computed by expanding the Kramers-Heisenberg formula in terms of ∆ω/ωLyα, where ωLyα is the angular frequency of the Lyα transition and ∆ω is the deviation of incident radiation from ωLyα. To the first order of ∆ω/ωLyα, we obtain σ(ω) = σT(0. 5 f 12 ωLyα/∆ω) 2 (1 − 1. 79 ∆ω/ωLyα), where σT is the <b>Thomson</b> scattering <b>cross</b> <b>section</b> and f 12 = 0. 4162 is the oscillator strength for the Lyα transition. With this deviation, the line center of the damped wing profile apparently shifts blueward of the true Lyα line center. In the case of a damped Lyα system with a H I column density 5 × 10 21 cm − 2, the apparent line center shift relative to the true center amounts to 0. 2 ˚A resulting in an underestimation of redshift by ∆z ∼ 10 − 4.

There could be a multitude of reasons for this: a stellar metallicity bias for GRB production, a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) and/or missing a significant fraction of star-formation in field galaxy surveys due to incompleteness, surface brightness limitations and cosmic variance.
