40|$|Most intra- and interorganizational {{decision}} making entails negotia-tions, and even naturally talented negotiators can improve with <b>training.</b> <b>Executive</b> trainings for managers and leadership programs for publicly elected officials, public managers, {{and nongovernmental organizations}} frequently include negotiation modules. These efforts, however, have yet to reach community leaders who also need to develop their negotiation skills. We propose thatmembers of disadvantaged low-income communities who lack educational and economic opportunities, and are less able to advocate for their own interest, need to build and strengthen their civic capacity, including their negotiation skills, to become more effective parties to decisions affecting them. While many professionals and executives have access to training, such opportunities are less accessible to the leaders of these disadvantaged communities. Although such leaders draw from their own heuristic knowledge, skills, and abilities, they could also benefit from sharpening their negotiation skills.

40|$|As {{mnemonic}} utilization {{deficit in}} older adults associates with age-related decline in executive function, {{we hypothesized that}} memory strategy training combined with executive function training might induce larger training effect in memory and broader training effects in non-memory outcomes than pure memory training. The present study compared the effects of combined cognitive <b>training</b> (<b>executive</b> function training plus memory strategy training) to pure memory strategy training. Forty healthy older adults {{were randomly assigned to}} a combined cognitive training group or a memory strategy training group. A control group receiving no training was also included. Combined cognitive training group received 16 sessions of training (eight sessions of executive function training followed by eight sessions of memory strategy training). Memory training group received 16 sessions of memory strategy training. The results partly supported our hypothesis in that indeed improved performance on executive function was only found in combined training group, whereas memory performance increased less in combined training compared to memory strategy group. Results suggest that combined cognitive training may be less efficient than pure memory training in memory outcomes, though the influences from insufficient training time and less closeness between trained executive function and working memory could not be excluded; however it has broader training effects in non-memory outcomes.

40|$|Executive {{function}} and intelligence are {{negatively associated with}} aggression, yet the role of executive function has rarely been examined {{in the context of}} school bullying. We studied whether different domains of executive {{function and}} non-verbal intelligence are associated with bullying involvement in early elementary school. The association was examined in a population-based sample of 1, 377 children. At age 4 years we assessed problems in inhibition, shifting, emotional control, working memory and planning/organization, using a validated parental questionnaire (the BRIEF-P). Additionally, we determined child non-verbal IQ at age 6 years. Bullying involvement as a bully, victim or a bully-victim in grades 1 - 2 of elementary school (mean age 7. 7 years) was measured using a peer-nomination procedure. Individual bullying scores were based on the ratings by multiple peers (on average 20 classmates). Analyses were adjusted for various child and maternal socio-demographic and psychosocial covariates. Child score for inhibition problems was associated with the risk of being a bully (OR per SD = 1. 35, 95 %CI: 1. 09 - 1. 66), victim (OR per SD = 1. 21, 95 %CI: 1. 00 - 1. 45) and a bully-victim (OR per SD = 1. 55, 95 %CI: 1. 10 - 2. 17). Children with higher non-verbal IQ {{were less likely to be}} victims (OR = 0. 99, 95 %CI: 0. 98 - 1. 00) and bully-victims (OR = 95 %CI: 0. 93 - 0. 98, respectively). In conclusion, our study showed that peer interactions may be to some extent influenced by children's executive function and non-verbal intelligence. Future studies should examine whether <b>training</b> <b>executive</b> function skills can reduce bullying involvement and improve the quality of peer relationships...|$|E

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} globalization of the hospitality industry and {{movement of people}} across international borders heightens the need for intercultural education and training. However, few intercultural training materials have a hospitality focus, and customized instruction is costly. The tool presented here helps reduce cultural barriers by providing a low-cost, hospitality-specific intercultural simulation that hospitality practitioners and educators can use {{with a wide variety}} of audiences. In the simulation, participants play the roles of members of three companies, each from a different fictional culture. At the simulated cocktail party that opens a series of important business meetings concerning a joint venture in the hospitality industry, participants establish business relationships and strive to overcome cultural differences that may impede those relationships. A debriefing discussion after the event reinforces the following key themes: Cultural values are relative, not absolute; Intercultural communication involves emotional as well as rational responses; Invisible cultural differences, such as values, attitudes, and beliefs, are more difficult to handle than visible differences, such as manners, customs, and rituals; Deciding who adapts to whom-and how-is the greatest challenge in intercultural interactions; and Cultural identity is multidimensional, involving far more than nationality alone. During the debriefing, participants apply these themes to their own work lives and past experiences interacting with culturally diverse colleagues, clients, guests, and business associates. Several follow-up options are possible to help participants use the knowledge they have gained. This report provides full instructions so that hospitality practitioners and educators can use the Cocktail Party Simulation in corporate-level management development programs, property-level <b>training,</b> <b>executive</b> education seminars, and college courses.

40|$|When workers {{observe a}} {{colleague}} behaving unsafely, they {{are confronted with}} a dilemma: Provide appropriate feedback and risk an argument, or say nothing. •Interpersonal feedback is risky because, in addition to criticizing the problematic behavior, feedback givers may, purposely or otherwise, criticize {{the person who is}} performing the behavior. •This article presents five steps to effective safety feedback that enable a peer to “do the right thing ” without jeopardizing his/ her relationships. Who sees more unsafe behavior on the job, the line manager, the SH&E manager or workers? As one occupational physician says (on condition of anonymity), “The guys on the floor see more violations than all the managers combined. But, they don’t always report them. ” With due respect to managers everywhere, {{it would be hard to}} argue otherwise. Whenever risky behavior occurs on the job, a coworker often is in the best position to see it. Whether it is a power plant engineer without ear protection or a crane operator who is talking on his cell phone or an accountant walking down stairs with his arms full, his/her behavior is most likely to be observed by a colleague. Yet, these observations often fail to result in constructive peer-to-peer feedback and, consequently, in safer behavior. Is this true because employees do not care about safety? Is it because workers do not care about other workers? Is it because they just do not value their own observations? In most cases, the answers are no, no and no. Instead, the most typical answer is that they do not want to start an argument. Unfortunately, for many people, feedback is just as likely to result in unwanted conflict as improved behavior. This lack of communication is unfortunate because without feedback, risky behavior is likely to continue. David Frances, Ph.

40|$|Executive {{functions}} (EFs) training interventions {{aimed at}} ADHD-symptom reduction have yielded mixed results. Generally, these interventions focus on training a single cognitive domain (e. g., working memory [WM], inhibition, or cognitive-flexibility). However, {{evidence suggests that}} most children with ADHD show deficits on multiple EFs, and that these EFs are largely related to different brain regions. Therefore, training multiple EFs might be a potentially more effective strategy to reduce EF-related ADHD symptoms. Eighty-nine children with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (aged 8 - 12) were randomized to either a full-active-condition where visuospatial WM, inhibition and cognitive-flexibility were trained, a partially-active-condition where inhibition and cognitive-flexibility were trained and the WM-training task was presented in placebo-mode, or to a full placebo-condition. Short-term and long-term (3 -months) effects of this gamified, 25 -session, home-based computer-training were evaluated on multiple outcome domains. During training compliance was high (only 3 % failed to meet compliance criteria). After training, only children in the full-active condition showed improvement on measures of visuospatial short-term-memory (STM) and WM. Inhibitory performance and interference control only improved in the full-active- and the partially-active condition. No Treatment-condition x Time interactions were found for cognitive-flexibility, verbal WM, complex-reasoning, nor for any parent-, teacher-, or child-rated ADHD behaviors, EF-behaviors, motivational behaviors, or general problem behaviors. Nonetheless, almost all measures showed main Time-effects, including the teacher-ratings. Improvements on inhibition and visuospatial STM and WM were specifically related {{to the type of}} treatment received. However, transfer to untrained EFs and behaviors was mostly nonspecific (i. e., only interference control improved exclusively in the two EF training conditions). As such, in this multiple EF-training, mainly nonspecific treatment factors - as opposed to the specific effects of training EFs-seem related to far transfer effects found on EF and behavior. trialregister. nl NTR 2728.
