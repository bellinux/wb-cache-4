40|$|We discuss {{our recent}} {{approaches}} {{to enable the}} specication of a conceptual reconciled schema by directly manipulating source conceptual schemas. In particular, we use reverse engineering tools to reconstruct conceptual schemas when these are not available, and use iconic operators to specify how to map source schemas <b>to</b> the <b>reconciled</b> one. Moreover, we describe the mapping of the conceptual <b>reconciled</b> schema <b>to</b> a logical data model, including mechanisms to extract data from sources and loading them <b>to</b> <b>reconciled</b> database...|$|R

Connecticut and Georgia would also later ratify Article Two, on May 13, 1987 and February 2, 1988 respectively.|$|E
