5|$|The game is {{presented}} in black-and-white tones, using lighting, film grain effects and minimal ambient sounds to create an eerie atmosphere often associated with the horror genre. Journalists praised the dark presentation, describing the work as comparable to film noir and German Expressionism. Based on its aesthetics, reviewers classified Limbo {{as an example of}} video games as an art form. Limbo received positive reviews, but its minimal story polarised critics; some critics found <b>the</b> <b>open-ended</b> work to have deeper meaning that tied well with the game's mechanics, while others believed the lack of significant plot and abrupt ending detracted from the game. A common point of criticism from reviewers was that the high cost of the game relative to its short length might deter players from purchasing the title, but some reviews proposed that Limbo had an ideal length. The title was the third-highest selling game on the Xbox Live Arcade service in 2010, generating around $7.5 million in revenue. The title won several awards from industry groups after its release, and was named {{as one of the top}} games for 2010 by several publications. Playdead's next title, Inside, was released in 2016, and revisited many of the same themes presented in Limbo.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>open-ended</b> {{nature of}} the lyrics has led to many interpretations.

With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song, he said, [...] "I'm not sure, really, about that. I used {{to think it was}} Belfast..." [...] Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono's and his wife Ali's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid-workers. Bono has expressed mixed opinions about <b>the</b> <b>open-ended</b> lyrics: [...] "I can look at it now and recognize that [...] {{has one of the most}} banal couplets in the history of pop music. But it also contains some of the biggest ideas. In a curious way, that seems to work. If you get any way heavy about these things, you don't communicate. But if you're flip or throwaway about it, then you do. That's one of the paradoxes I've come to terms with." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{relationship}} to Miracle Day, where Jack becomes mortal, critics approached Barrowman and Davies {{about the implications}} of such a move for Jack's potential future as the Face of Boe. Barrowman stated that <b>the</b> <b>open-ended</b> rules of the science fiction genre meant that Jack could still become the Face of Boe even after Miracle Day. By contrast, Davies was keen to emphasise that the possibility of Jack becoming the Face of Boe remained [...] "conjecture", and that the possibility remained that Jack would not survive Miracle Day, adding [...] "You know how I love killing people off." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Telegraph {{described}} the episode as displaying [...] "an exhilarating flair for rapid change of comic gear" [...] and commented positively {{on the scene}} in which pilgrims descend on the Meldrews' home.

The music, composed by Michael McCann, focused on ambiance and three-layered compositions over character themes and overt melodies.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles was {{recorded}} between 30 May and 14 October 1968, largely at Abbey Road Studios in London, with some sessions at Trident Studios. The group block-booked time at Abbey Road through to July, and their times at Rishikesh were soon {{forgotten in the}} atmosphere of the studio, with sessions occurring at irregular hours. The group's self-belief that they could do anything {{led to the formation of}} a new multimedia business corporation Apple Corps, an enterprise that drained the group financially with a series of unsuccessful projects. <b>The</b> <b>open-ended</b> studio time led to a new way of working out songs. Instead of tightly rehearsing a backing track, as had happened in previous sessions, the group would simply record all the rehearsals and jamming, then add overdubs to the best take.

500|$|The {{original}} values statement was, and remains, controversial. [...] U.S. Green Party co-founder John Rensenbrink credits it {{with helping}} {{to unify the}} often contentious Greens.

[...] Greta Gaard says it fails to call {{for the elimination of}} capitalism or racism. [...] Looking back after 20 years, Green activist Brian Tokar said that [...] "the voice of the original [...] questions is distinctly personal … and aims to avoid fundamental conflicts with elite social and cultural norms." [...] A [...] "modified" [...] list of the Ten Key Values became part of the U.S. Greens' political platform. [...] However, all <b>the</b> <b>open-ended</b> questions were replaced by declaratory sentences, and the U.S. Greens have come to be regarded as a party of the left, rather than one seeking to be neither left nor right.|$|E

500|$|Dwarf Fortress {{was praised}} for its depth and complexity.

[...] PC Gamer's Steve Hogarty commented, [...] "Dwarf Fortress's reluctance to expend even a joule of energy in prettying itself results in astonishing hidden complexity." [...] Regarding <b>the</b> <b>open-ended</b> nature and emergent gameplay, Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Graham Smith found that with its procedurally generated world and characters simulated [...] "down to the most minute detail", the game's results are [...] "often hilarious, occasionally tragic, and always surprising." [...] Mike Rose from Gamasutra said, [...] "...to an outsider looking in on this game so many years into development, with such a wide scope of features and potential play styles, it's {{fair to say that}} getting into Dwarf Fortress is {{perhaps one of the most}} daunting tasks the video game industry as a whole can provide." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} {{of what is}} said and depicted in the game is open to interpretation, leading fans to develop and discuss theories {{about the nature of}} the events that occur in the game. Let's Players Voidburger and Bob from the video-game related podcast The Grate Debate opined that <b>the</b> <b>open-ended</b> nature of the game is one of its greatest aspects. They also said that there may be something in the game that has not been discovered yet. They noted the colored lights as something they still had not figured out, and they felt that the game hinted that the radio may be the main culprit behind the father's killing. The game also contained a Swedish line in the radio describing a radio drama from 1938 being true, which gamers suggested may be a nod to Orson Welles's radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds. This possible reference to alien invasions was noted as a continuation of a Silent Hill tradition of having secret endings that included aliens. Another theory commonly discussed is deciphering the identity of the player character. The fetus talking to the player character about his remembering moments [...] "ten months back" [...] seems to imply that he is the father who killed Lisa and the kids, although Voidburger and Bob believe that the player character may be the protagonist that was to be in Silent Hills, as shown in the trailer following the ending of P.T.|$|E
