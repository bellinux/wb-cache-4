5|$|A major {{difficulty}} {{the team}} encountered was converting all game elements into a fully-3D world, including {{the sound and}} radio stations, as well as designing and voicing the non-player characters, due to the amount that existed within the open world; producer Dan Houser said that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue in the game, while audio programmer Raymond Usher estimated about 18,000. The basic technical elements of the game began {{to work together in}} mid-2000, with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable streaming model. Streaming was initially intended to be reserved for music and map geometry, but other elements were eventually included when it became apparent to the team as more data was entered.|$|E
5|$|With a {{strength}} that {{continued to grow}} until <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> 350 men around the bridge, the charges that had {{been placed on the}} bridge were removed and No. 3 Commando settled in to defend the bridge as they waited for 50th Division to arrive.

Eventually, as casualties mounted and their reinforcement became overdue the Commandos were forced to abandon the position, nevertheless they had prevented the bridge from being blown up and it was eventually recaptured as the Eighth Army arrived a short time later. The unit, however, suffered heavily for the success, suffering 30 killed, 66 wounded and 59 missing or captured. The bridge was later renamed No. 3 Commando Bridge in their honour.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 2,254houses were flooded in the country, forcing {{thousands}} of people to evacuate. Overall, 2,694houses were damaged, and another 12 were destroyed. Many houses lost their roofs, and high winds left 608,130buildings without power in Honshu, along with thousands of power on Hokkaido. Two people were electrocuted by downed power lines. High rainfall caused mudslides near Tokyo, which destroyed a few buildings, and caused the Tama River to reach above-normal levels. Across Japan, the typhoon disrupted transportation by forcing highways to be closed. Storm debris injured several people, and a steel window frame struck and killed a man in Yokohama. A tree fell onto a car, injuring one person. Insured damage in Japan totaled $2.14billion (¥261billion 2002JPY). In Iwate Prefecture, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> $73million (¥8billion 2002JPY) in damage, mostly from damaged roads and public buildings.

The Red Guards came from the nearby villages of Längelmäki, Jämsä and Orivesi, and from the southern Finland from Urjala, Hämeenlinna, Tuusula, Kerava, Mäntsälä, Espoo and Helsinki. The Helsinki Red Guard had sent its famous A-komppania (the ″A Company″). It was one of the Red elite units, composed of strength sports athletes and gymnasts.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the Finnish Civil War, Lahti had a {{population}} of 6,500. The town was important for the Reds due to its location by the vital Riihimäki–Saint Petersburg railway, connecting Lahti to the major war theatres in Tavastia and Karelia. Red troops were formed and trained in the Hennala Garrison which the Russians had built in the early 1910s. As the Red front had collapsed {{in the northern part of}} Tavastia and the Battle of Tampere was over in 6 April, tens of thousands of Red refugees headed east through Hämeenlinna and Lahti.

25|$|The {{village of}} Rully {{produces}} {{about twice as}} much white Chardonnay than red Pinot noir wines. As of 2008, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> 756 acres (306 hectares) planted in this area. The soil of the area is sandy and light, producing light bodied wines that are best consumed young. The area is {{a major source of}} sparkling Crémant de Bourgogne which benefit from cooler vintages. In warmer years the wines tend to be lively with the whites showing apple notes. More than one sixth of all the vineyards in Rully have premier cru designations. The red wines of Rully tend to have more simple fruit notes, while the higher-quality white wines can display crisp leanness with lemon and nutty notes. The red wines tend to drink at their peak between 5–12 years after vintage while the whites usually drink well between 3–8 years.|$|E

500|$|Typhoon Rammasun, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Florita, {{was the first of}} four typhoons to {{contribute}} to heavy rainfall and deadly flooding in the Philippines in July2002.

The storm tracked northwestward toward Taiwan, and on July2 it attained its peak intensity with winds of 160km/h (100mph). Rammasun turned northward, passing east of Taiwan and China. In Taiwan, the outer rainbands dropped rainfall that alleviated drought conditions. In China, the rainfall occurred after previously wet conditions, resulting in additional flooding, although damage was less than expected; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> $85million in crop and fishery damage in one province.|$|E
