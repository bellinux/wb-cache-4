The amount of supplement dry matter fed was 6. 2 kg/ d in year 1 and 7. 9 kg/d in year 2. This accounted for approximately 35 to 40 % of {{total dry matter}} intake. In year 2, cows were administered bST every 2 weeks. In each year, 40 cows (20 primiparous in year 1 and 12 primiparous in year 2) were grazed. Of the 40 cows in year 1, 27 (14 primiparous) grazed the grass paddocks and 13 (6 primiparous) grazed the mixed paddocks. In year 2, all 40 cows grazed grass paddocks as one group. Intensive rotational grazing was practiced by using electric fences to allocate grazing areas. Fresh paddocks were provided every 24 hr. Results and Discussion Milk yield declined upon <b>turning</b> cows <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>pasture</b> (Fig. 1). The decline was less in year 1 with the grass-legume pasture than for the all grass pasture. The decline in milk production upon <b>turning</b> cows <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>pasture</b> in year 2 was even more evident (Fig. 2). This may reflect the higher milk production level when cows were placed on <b>pasture,</b> probably due <b>to</b> the use of bST, {{as well as the}} absence of legume species in the pasture. Total lactation yields for a 308 day lactation were: (year 1) 19, 520 lb for cows on all grass, and 20, 120 lb for the mixed grass-legume pasture; (year 2) 22, 120 lb for all cows given bST and on all grass pasture. Conclusions Total milk production was about 4, 000 lb higher in this study for fall calved cows pastured in late lactation compared to spring calved cows pastured in early lactation (Dhiman and Satter 1996).

In experiment 1, 24 calves were reared in groups of 3 or individually in straw-bedded pens from age 1 to 7 wk. One-half of the calves in each treatment were provided with ad libitum cut perennial ryegrass herbage. Grass intakes and time spent eating grass were greater for grouped calves than for individual calves. Providing grass reduced concentrate intake of grouped calves and reduced the time that all calves, but particularly individual calves, spent eating straw bedding. Ruminating time was increased by offering grass to grouped calves compared with individual calves. Grass reduced the frequency of calves licking their buckets and their pen, vocalizing, and investigating their pen. Particularly for grouped calves provision of grass reduced all grooming. Group rearing reduced the frequency of calves licking their bucket, vocalizing, and investigating their pen, but {{had no effect on}} the frequency of pen licking.

Even with the decrease in manufactured items produced with lead, contaminants persist in the landscape and may enter the food supply through animal products. Changing patterns of open range herds moving <b>to</b> new <b>pasture</b> and the increased popularity of urban/suburban backyard chickens or other livestock necessitates public awareness about the clinical signs of lead intoxication, the potential for subclinical animals, public health concerns, particularly for exposure in children, and testing options available. Cases of lead intoxication in livestock demand a thorough case work-up to identify all sources of lead, address subclinical cases, evaluate risk to consumers, and make management suggestions for future prevention. We discuss four recent cases of confirmed lead poisoning in backyard chickens and open range cattle and assess the public health implications therein. Taken {{as a whole and}} considering the potential of the remaining herd or flock to be affected without necessarily showing signs, public health officials and veterinarians should be prepared to advise clients on case work-up and management and prevention considerations. Backyard chickens and cattle may not present for suspected lead poisoning as in several of the cases discussed herein yet may still contain concerning tissue or blood levels.

Les 2 caractères présentent une forte étendue de variation entre races (8 à 10 ovules et 20 à 25 points de pourcentage pour TO et SE respectivement). Les effets d’hétérosis direct sont peu importants (2 à 3 % pour TO; 1 à 2 % pour SE). Par contre, la survie embryonnaire présente un effet d’hétérosis maternel important (environ 8 %). L’héritabilité du taux d’ovulation est relativement élevée (0, 30). Celle de la survie embryonnaire est moins bien connue, mais semble comparable ou légèrement supérieure à celle de la prolificité (environ 0, 15). La corrélation génétique entre TO et SE est négative, les liaisons avec la prolificité étant par contre positives. Les quelques estimations disponibles ne permettent malheureusement pas de préciser l’importance de ces relations. Des liaisons avec le système majeur d’histocompatibilité et la présence de translocations réciproques ont par ailleurs été mises en évidence. D’autres sont suspectées avec le groupe sanguin H et le locus de la transferrine. Les possibilités d’utilisation de ces composantes pour l’amélioration génétique de la prolificité sont ensuite discutées. Des perspectives semblent exister, mais l’imprécision de nos connaissances sur la variabilité génétique de TO et SE et les problèmes de modélisation de la survie embryonnaire ne permettent pas, pour l’instant,de conclure. The {{objective of}} this study was to determine the effect of disease on milk production and their relationships with milking characteristics and milking career. This work was carried out at the same time as a feed trial (comparison of feed based on hay or silage with two different amounts of concentrate) which lasted 6 years and concerned 487 lactations of 190 "Pie-Noire" and "Montbéliarde" cows. During the 487 lactations, 595 health problems were observed, which concerned 59 % of these lactations, at an average rate of 2. 1 per lactation. Lameness and mastitis represented 52 and 24 %, respectively, of all infections. 47 % of mastitis occured during the first two months of lactation, whereas the frequency of lameness increased throughout winter to reach a maximum when the animals were <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>pasture.</b> In the short term (5 weeks), the greatest loss in production was caused by winter mastitis (24 kg) and particularly lameness arising from animals being <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>pasture</b> (56 kg). Throughout the milk producing period it is repeated bouts of lameness which cause the greatest loss in milk production : 640 kg of milk for cows having had 3 lamenesses or more as opposed to 20 kg for those having had only one lameness and 160 kg for those with one or several mastitis infections. Repeated lameness was 3 times greater in "Pie-Noire" cows than in "Montbéliardes" and 4 times more frequent in cows having received winter feed based on silage than those receiving hay based feed. Four main classes of milk production can be distinguished based on the amount of milk produced, animal health, their reproduction and finally, their culling. The differences in milk production between the 4 groups reached 1 800 kg of milk per lactation. Cows receiving grass silage feed with a small amount of concentrate had a shorter milking career than those on other types of feed (2. 5 as compared to 3. 2 - 3. 5 lactations). Cows with serious health problems (multiple lameness) in their first lactation had a much shorter milking career (1. 1 lactation) than cows that were healthy in their first lactation. On average, milk production and live weight increased, respectively, 622 and 51 kg, between the first and the third lactation. This increase in milk production was greater in cows receiving winter fodder based on hay (high or low amount of concentrate) or based on grass silage with a high amount of concentrate (+ 752 kg) than those being fed on rations of grass silage with a low amount of concentrate (+ 359 kg). Over 3 lactations, the greatest difference in milk production between the groups (hay + high amount of concentrate, silage + low amount of concentrate) reached 2 770 kg thus a difference of 26 %. These findings demonstrate that certain conclusions based on results obtained during winter or from lactation must be reconsidered...|$|R

Mean lambing dates and fertiliser N application rates were 20 and 30 March, and 85 and 92 kg/ha, for the GWF and YRG systems, respectively. Concentrate supplementation during late pregnancy was similar on both systems. For the GWF and YRG systems, litter size, lamb mortality, number of lambs reared, birth weight (kg), weaning weight (kg) and lamb carcass output (kg/ha) were 2. 17 and 2. 24 (s. e. 0. 038), 10. 1 and 13. 8 % (P = 0. 05), 1. 77 and 1. 78 (s. e. 0. 042), 4. 0 and 4. 7 (s. e. 0. 05, P < 0. 001), 27. 9 and 30. 8 (s. e. 0. 25, P < 0. 001) and 469 and 348, respectively. Belclare ewes had a higher litter size (2. 34 v 2. 07; s. e. 0. 038, P < 0. 001) and number of lambs reared per ewe joined (1. 86 v 1. 69; s. e. 0. 048, P < 0. 01) than the Cheviot × Belclare ewes.

50|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{attempts at}} winemaking {{in the area}} occurred in the 1770s, when Thomas Jefferson provided financial support to Italian winemaker, Phillip Mazzei, who made a small quantity of wine from the native grapes, but without much success. Jefferson gave Mazzei significant acreage less than 1 mi south of Monticello {{for the purpose of}} growing grapes. The area was planted in 1774. In 1776, {{with the advent of the}} Revolutionary war, Jefferson and George Washington dispatched Mazzei back to Italy to solicit war funding from the Duke of Tuscany. As was the practice at that time, Mazzei rented his home, in this instance to the Hessian cavalry officer Friedrich Adolf Riedesel, a prisoner of war who had been captured at Saratoga and was imprisoned in the Charlottesville barracks. Riedesel moved his entire staff up to Mazzei's home and <b>turned</b> their horses <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>pasture</b> in the infant vineyards. The vineyards were destroyed.|$|R

Before midnight they were again on their way, and proceeded at a rapid pace towards the mountains, until a few hours before noon, when their horses began to sink under the united influence of their previous exertions and the increasing heat of the day. Iskander looked serious, and often threw a backward glance in the direction of Adrianople.|$|R
25|$|Feed {{provision}} {{is also an}} important feature of dairy housing. Pasture based dairies are a more extensive option where cows are <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> graze on <b>pasture</b> when the weather permits. Often the diet must be supplemented with when poor pasture conditions persist. Free stall barns and open lots are intensive housing options where feed is brought to the cattle at all times of year. Free stall barns are designed to allow the cows freedom to choose when they feed, rest, drink, or stand. They can be either fully enclosed or open air barns again depending on the climate. The resting areas, called free stalls, are divided beds lined with anything from mattresses to sand. In the lanes between rows of stalls, the floor is often make of grooved concrete. Most barns open onto uncovered corrals, which the cattle are free to enjoy as the weather allows. Open lots are dirt lots with constructed shade structures and a concrete pad where feed is delivered.|$|R
40|$|Several {{biological}} parameters {{were measured}} in 31 heifers naturally infected with Fasciola hepatica during one grazing {{season in the}} Belgian Ardennes. A forecast model based on daily temperature {{used to assess the}} risk of fasciolosis was fitted to this assay. Cattle were <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> two <b>pastures.</b> Each pasture was divided into two plots: one was treated with calcium cyanamide and the other was left untreated. The Lymnaea truncatula snails were counted on three different occasions. The results indicated a poor molluscicide efficiency. Body weight gains, anti-Fasciola antibody levels, faecal egg counts, levels of sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma GT), packed cell volumes, white blood cells and differential leucocyte counts were determined monthly. No statistically significant difference was observed between animals from the two plots regardless of the recorded data. No correlation was found between body weight gains and other biological data. The sampling date had a significant effect on the antibody responses within a same group, and on the enzymatic levels for all groups combined. The forecast results were consistent with the recorded data. Temperature was a major bioclimatic constraint on the transmission of life cycle, and risk of infection occurred mainly in late spring (May/June) and in early September. Current results might be used to issue advice on the need for flukicide treatment of cattle. The indicators of the infection considered alone were useless and it is concluded that herd diagnosis of fasciolosis may rely on the rise of specific antibody levels, possibly associated with an increase in hepatic enzyme activities.

40|$|Strongylus vulgaris is {{the most}} {{pathogenic}} nematode parasite of horses. Its extensive migration in the mesenteric blood vessels can lead to life-threatening intestinal infarctions. Recent work has shown that this parasite is still identified among managed horse populations. A serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed {{for the detection of}} migrating larvae of S. vulgaris. Previous work has documented an increase in ELISA values following larvicidal treatment with ivermectin and suggested that the target parasite antigen is primarily produced by the later larval stages. The aim {{of this study was to}} experimentally inoculate cohorts of foals with S. vulgaris, and then compare ELISA responses to early or later ivermectin treatments. Fifteen foals were held in confinement and infected orally with ~ 25 S. vulgaris third-stage larvae on days 0, 7, 14, and 21. Foals were weaned on Day 43 and <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a <b>pasture</b> not previously grazed by horses. Foals remained at pasture continuously until the study was terminated on Day 196. On Day 55, foals were randomly allocated to three treatment groups of five each. Group 1 received ivermectin on Day 56, Group 2 received ivermectin on Day 112, and Group 3 foals served as untreated controls. Serum and fecal samples were collected at 28 -day intervals throughout the study. Serum samples were analyzed with the S. vulgaris-specific ELISA and fecal samples were processed for fecal egg counting. The ELISA values of Group 1 foals were significantly lower than Groups 2 or 3 on days 140 - 196. Both treated groups exhibited increased ELISA values following ivermectin treatment. Results indicate that the target diagnostic antigen is produced throughout the course of arterial infection with S. vulgaris, but that an early ivermectin treatment can reduce the cumulative antigen produced over the course of an infection...|$|R
40|$|The major {{perturbation}} that beef cows {{have to face}} in extensive livestock {{systems is}} changes in feed resource availability. The ability of beef cows to face variable nutritional environments (robustness) involves adaptive processes that drive adjustments in the energy allocation toward life functions. This study proposes an indirect approach to quantify the modulation of energy allocation over a changing nutritional environment. The concept of residual energy (Eresid), defined as the net energy intake minus the energy secreted in milk and deposited in tissues, was used to investigate the variation in energy allocation priority for maintaining productive traits. In this study robustness was assessed by the difference in Eresid between cows experiencing either variable or non limiting nutritional trajectories and differing in body reserves at calving. Forty multiparous Charolais suckling cows, differing in their body condition at calving (moderate (M, n= 19) : BCSc= 2. 0 ± 0. 04 (scale 0 – 5)) vs fat (F, n= 18) : BCSc= 2. 8 ± 0. 08) were used. They were submitted to two energy levels during the first 120 days post-partum (P 1) : Control (MC (n= 9) and FC (n= 9)) vs Low (ML (n= 10) and FL (n= 9)). The average energy intake, expressed in net energy for lactation (NEL), was 90. 7 and 54. 7 MJ/d/cow for C and L cows, respectively. Subsequently (P 2, 120 – 196 days post-partum) all the cows were <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a permanent <b>pasture.</b> BW, body condition and milk production were regularly measured in P 1 and P 2. Body lipid reserves were assessed at calving, end of P 1 and end of P 2 by measuring adipose cell diameter. The overall milk production was similar between groups of cows over the 2 phases of the changing nutritional trajectories highlighting the robustness of beef cows to achieve this function. During P 1, L cows lost BW and body lipid reserves. During P 2, BW and BCS gains were similar in FL and ML cows. At the end of P 2, FL and ML cows weighed 20 and 10 kg less than FC and MC cows, respectively. Considering both experimental periods (P 1 +P 2), Eresid was 23 % lower in L than in C cows (P< 0. 05). This difference was observed regardless of BCSc, showing that thin beef cows withstood the change in nutritional trajectory after calving similarly to the fatter ones. Eresid changes reflect the ability of beef cows to preserve energy allocation toward life functions in changing nutritional environments and {{may be viewed as}} indirect criteria of robustness...|$|R
