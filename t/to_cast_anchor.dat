25|$|On {{attempting}} its entrance {{he discovered}} three ships {{up the river}} and {{at the point of}} the land two companies of infantry, who brought their artillery to bear upon him. So he gave up trying to capture the entrance and made for St. Augustine. The three Spanish vessels which took the southerly course in pursuit of the remaining French ship continued the chase all night. Menéndez had ordered them to rejoin him {{at the mouth of the}} St. Johns in the morning, and, if unable to do so, to return to St. Augustine. A storm arose and they were obliged <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> off the coast, the vessels being so small they dared not to take to the sea. One of the three broke away, and while in this peril a French ship was sighted, but it did not attack them, although it hove to within a league of their own ship.|$|E
25|$|Sir, I {{have the}} honor of informing you that I have arrived in this port with a {{commission}} from the Supreme Government of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata to take possession of these islands {{on behalf of the}} country to which they belong by Natural Law. While carrying out this mission I want to do so with all the courtesy and respect all friendly nations; one of the objectives of my mission is to prevent the destruction of resources necessary for all ships passing by and forced <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> here, as well as to help them to obtain the necessary supplies, with minimum expenses and inconvenience. Since your presence here is not in competition with these purposes and in the belief that a personal meeting will be fruitful for both of us, I invite you to come aboard, where you'll be welcomed to stay as long as you wish; I would also greatly appreciate your extending this invitation to any other British subject found in the vicinity; I am, respectfully yours. Signed, Jewett, Colonel of the Navy of the United Provinces of South America and commander of the frigate Heroína.|$|E
60|$|Thinking {{it might}} be a good plan <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> over night, they {{attempted}} to do so. But although they let out all the rope and chain, no bottom could be found.|$|E
30|$|A {{second level}} of “resistance” is {{constituted}} by {{the plan and}} project as resistance to oblivion and as strategy structuring the elements of permanency in an ever-changing world, as resistance to uncertain, fleeting situations that indeed do not enable an experience to be had of stability. In this case, plan or project becomes an instrument <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchors,</b> create reference points or cornerstones 2 from which to depart to define transformations that will incorporate and perpetuate them, although keeping the flexibility needed {{to come to terms}} with a steadily evolving world.|$|R
50|$|All {{support systems}} {{have to be}} height {{adjustable}} to allow the formwork to be placed at the correct height and to be removed after the concrete is cured. Normally adjustable metal props similar to (or the same as) those used by beam slab formwork are used to support these systems. Some systems combine stringers and supports into steel or aluminum trusses. Yet other systems use metal frame shoring towers, which the decks are attached to. Another common method is to attach the formwork decks <b>to</b> previously <b>cast</b> walls or columns,thus eradicating the use of vertical props altogether. In this method, adjustable support shoes are bolted through holes (sometimes tie holes) or attached <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchors.</b>|$|R
6000|$|At {{last they}} reached the vessel, pulled well <b>to</b> windward, <b>cast</b> <b>anchor,</b> and eased off the cable, until they passed her stern and got under her lee. Just then Harry looked up and {{felt as if he}} had {{received}} a shock from electric fire, for he beheld the pale face of Annie Webster gazing at him with glowing eyes! No longer did he feel the chilling blast. The blood rushed wildly through his veins as he shouted-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{continued}} the captain, rubbing {{his hands and}} looking benignantly at Jessie, [...] "I have settled the matter at last; fairly said good-bye to old Ocean, an' fixed <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> for good on the land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, pretty enough," [...] replied Gascoyne in a {{somewhat}} sad tone of voice; [...] "I had hoped to have led a quiet life here once,--but that was not to be. How say you, Bumpus; could you {{make up your mind}} <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> here for a year or so?" ...|$|E
60|$|To {{this the}} gallant seaman {{declared}} {{that he would be}} only too happy <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> altogether where he was {{for the rest of his}} life, but that duty was duty, and that, blow high or blow low, fair weather or foul, duty had to be attended to.|$|E
60|$|It took Captain Marshall but {{an instant}} to {{consider}} the situation, and he immediately gave orders <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> an <b>anchor.</b> The Stormy Petrel continued to rush onward, but {{quarter of a mile}} from the shore the forward progress was checked. Then another anchor was dropped, and it was seen that this had secured a good hold. In the meantime the waters of the tidal wave began to recede, and by sunset the ocean was almost as calm as ever.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> {{the regular}} <b>cast,</b> <b>anchor</b> and political commentator Chris Matthews, voice actor Fred Tatasciore, opera singer Nathan Gunn, radio personality Eddie Sotelo and Kel MacFarlane, webmaster of the Seth MacFarlane fan site, guest {{starred in the}} episode. Recurring guest voice actors Ralph Garman, writer John Viener, writer Mark Hentemann, actress Alexandra Breckenridge, writer Alec Sulkin and writer Danny Smith also made minor appearances.|$|R
60|$|Setting sail {{down the}} gulf they ran before a fair breeze which speedily {{increased}} to a favouring gale. Before night a small bay was descried, with three log-huts on the shore. This {{was the new}} fort. They ran into the bay, grazing a smooth rock in their passage, which caused the Fairy to tremble from stem <b>to</b> stern, and <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> close <b>to</b> a wooden jetty. On {{the end of this}} a solitary individual, (apparently a maniac), was seen capering and yelling wildly.|$|R
60|$|These {{two gentlemen}} have remarkably pretty wives, and wonderfully boisterous {{children}}, and the uproar which these children make when Molloy comes <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> among them, is stupendous! As for {{the appearance of}} the brood, and of Jack after a spree among the hay, the word has yet to be invented which will correctly describe it.|$|E
60|$|The sloop Penguin, {{commanded}} by Ruby's father, {{was on a}} voyage to Newcastle at that time, and was expected in Arbroath every day. But it was fated never more <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> in that port. The great storm, to which reference {{has been made in}} a previous chapter, caused many wrecks on the shores of Britain. The Penguin, was one of the many.|$|E
60|$|The admiral decided <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor,</b> and, at the chain's rattle, {{the forest}} was stimulated to instant and resounding uproar. The {{mouth of the}} Rio Ruiz had only been taking a morning nap. Parrots and baboons screeched and barked in the trees; a {{whirring}} and a hissing and a booming marked the awakening of animal life; a dark blue bulk was visible for an instant, as a startled tapir fought {{his way through the}} vines.|$|E
2500|$|He {{reasoned}} that the trade winds of the Pacific might move in a gyre as the Atlantic winds did. If in the Atlantic, ships made the Volta do mar to pick up winds that would bring them back from Madeira, then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds {{to bring him back}} to North America. His hunch paid off, and he hit the coast near Cape Mendocino, California, then followed the coast south. The ship reached the port of Acapulco, on October 8, 1565, having travelled [...] in 130 days. Fourteen of his crew died; only Urdaneta and Felipe de Salcedo, nephew of López de Legazpi, had strength enough <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> the <b>anchors.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Under the {{direction}} of the English architect, Edward Taylor, the New Customs House was built in 1855 back to back with the rear walls of the Fort, facing the river. It is the first public building of great size built by the young mercantile State of Buenos Aires; its semicircular shape had five floors for depots and fifty one storage rooms with arched ceilings, surrounded by loggias. From the central tower at the top of which there was a clock and a beacon, stretched out a 300 m pier providing wharfaging for ships of greater draught <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> their <b>anchors.</b> Via two side ramps carts, loaded with goods, accessed the manoeuvring dock. It was used for almost forty years and it was demolished down to the first floor by the Madero Port project and its foundations are buried under what is today [...]|$|R
2500|$|During {{the night}} of September 24, 1939 after unprecedentedly hot summer, Santa Monica Bay {{was hit by a}} severe storm, gales {{reaching}} [...] At the time, captain Olaf A. Olsen, five other crew members were on board together with an unidentified number of guests. Anchored at the bay, the Minnie A. Caine was riding out the storm six miles off the Santa Monica pier. When the old anchor chain failed the crew was too slow <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> the spare <b>anchor,</b> and the former schooner was thrown onto the shore at [...] by the intersection of Sunset boulevard and then Roosevelt Highway (now Pacific Coast Highway, part of California State Route 1).|$|R
6000|$|To allay my impatience, {{that morning}} I was invited into several huts {{for the purpose}} of {{drinking}} sour milk. A malicious joy filled my soul, as about noon, the Machiavellian Captain of the [...] "Reed" [...] managed <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor,</b> after driving his crazy craft through a sea which the violent Shimal was flinging in hollow curves foam-fringed upon the strand. I stood on the shore making signs for a canoe. My desires were disregarded, as long as decency admitted. At last, about 1 P.M., I found myself upon the quarter-deck.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{the night}} breeze began to flow off the land, the great sail was hoisted, {{and with the}} help of oars, worked by slaves, the ship cleared the harbour and set her course for Joppa. Two hours later the wind failed so that they could proceed only by rowing over a dead and oily sea, beneath a sky that was full of heavy clouds. Lacking any stars to steer by, the captain wished <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor,</b> but as the water proved too deep they {{proceeded}} slowly, till about an hour before dawn a sudden gust struck them which caused the galley to lean over.|$|E
60|$|I {{got over}} the absence of my honest {{merchant}} but slowly at first. It was with infinite regret that I let him go at all; and when I read the letter he left I was quite confounded. As {{soon as he was}} out of call and irrecoverable I would have given half I had in the world for him back again; my notion of things changed in an instant, and I called myself a thousand fools for casting myself upon a life of scandal and hazard, when, after the shipwreck of virtue, honour, and principle, and sailing at the utmost risk in the stormy seas of crime and abominable levity, I had a safe harbour presented, and no heart <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> in it.|$|E
50|$|Urdaneta {{founded the}} first {{churches in the}} Philippines, the St. Vitales Church and the Basilica del Santo Niño; he served as the first prelate of the Church in Cebu. After {{spending}} {{some time in the}} islands, Legazpi determined to remain and sent Urdaneta back for the purpose of finding a better return route and to obtain help from New Spain for the Philippine colony. (For the problem of sailing east across the Pacific, which Urdaneta solved, see Manila Galleon and Volta do Mar.) Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel (the island of Cebu), on June 1, 1565 and was obliged to sail as far as 38 degrees North latitude to obtain favourable winds. With the voyage in trouble, Urdaneta had to assume command himself. The ship reached the port of Acapulco, on October 8, 1565, having traveled 12,000 miles (20,000 km) in 130 days. Fourteen of the crew had died; only Urdaneta and Felipe de Salcedo, nephew of López de Legazpi, had strength enough <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> the <b>anchors.</b>|$|R
60|$|Soon {{after this}} the troop-ship {{reached the end}} of her voyage, and <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> off the coast of Egypt, near the far-famed city of Alexandria.|$|R
60|$|The {{day that}} {{followed}} this event continued calm, but towards evening a light breeze sprang up, and before midnight the Snowflake <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> in the harbour of Bergen.|$|R
60|$|But no such fears troubled {{the mind}} of the skipper of the brig Belinda, which was now making the best of her way towards the port of Belize. She was a sturdy vessel and carried no prejudices. Sometimes she was laden with goods bought from the pirates and destined to be sold to honest people; and, again, she carried {{commodities}} purchased from those who were their legal owners and intended {{for the use of the}} bold rascals who sailed under the Jolly Roger. Then, as now, it was impossible for thieves to steal all the commodities they desired; some things must be bought. Thus, serving the pirates as well as honest traders, the sloop Belinda feared not to sail the Gulf of Honduras or <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> by the town of Belize.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so, Poll, you're {{a clever}} girl; keep {{it for me}} till I come back, or rather take it to Bailie Trench and he'll {{tell you how to}} keep it. It's a good pot o' money, Poll, and has cost me the best part of a lifetime, workin' hard and spendin' little, to lay it by. Once I used to think," [...] {{continued}} the captain in a sad soliloquising tone, [...] "that I'd live <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> near the old spot, and spend it with your mother, Polly, and you; but the Lord willed it otherwise, and He does all things well, blessed be His name! Now you understand what you're to do about the money, don't you, if you should ever find yourself without me in Scotland, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Nelson possessed in an eminent {{degree the}} power of infusing into his men the irresistible {{confidence}} that animated his own bosom. There was probably not {{a man in the}} British fleet who did not sail into Aboukir Bay on that memorable day with a feeling of certainty that the battle was as good as gained before it was begun. The cool, quiet, self-possessed manner in which the British tars went to work at the beginning must have been very impressive to the enemy; for, as they advanced, they did not even condescend to fire a shot in reply to the storm of shot and shell to which the leading ships were treated by the batteries on an island in the bay, and by the broadsides of the whole French fleet at half gunshot-range, the men being too busily engaged in furling the sails aloft, attending to the braces below, and preparing <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Quiet, you scugs,' he cried, 'or I'll <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> in you'; and at {{once the}} din was hushed. 'Are all the {{children}} chained, so that they cannot fly away?' ...|$|R
5000|$|A new Justice League {{animated}} series titled Justice League Action debuted on Cartoon Network in Fall 2016. The series {{feature a}} revolving <b>cast</b> <b>anchored</b> by Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis a sweet spot," [...] said Redhand to his comrades, {{who stood}} or {{reclined}} in various attitudes around him. [...] "Such {{a place as}} I've often thought of <b>casting</b> <b>anchor</b> in for life." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nothing {{can be more}} fulsome or loathsome to my mind {{than the}} continual sham-religious clap-traps which the author has put {{into the mouth of}} his hero; nothing more unsailor-like than his namby-pamby starlit descriptions, which my ingenious {{colleague}} has, I see, alluded to. [...] "Thy faith my anchor, and thine eyes my haven," [...] cries the gallant captain to his lady. See how loosely the sentence is constructed, like a thousand others in the book. The captain is <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> with the girl's faith in her own eyes; either image might pass by itself, but together, like the quadrupeds of Kilkenny, they devour each other. The captain tells his lieutenant to BID HIS BARK VEER ROUND to a point in the harbor. Was ever such language? My lady gives Sir Maurice a thousand pounds to WAFT him (her son) to some distant shore. Nonsense, sheer nonsense; and what is worse, affected nonsense! ...|$|E
60|$|Tim Rokens {{stuck to}} his old {{commander}} to the last. He said he had sailed with him {{the better part of}} his life, in the same ships, had weathered the same storms, and chased the same fish, and now that the captain had made up his mind to lay up in port, he meant <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> beside him. So the bold harpooner became a species of overseer and jack-of-all-trades on the property. Phil Briant set up as a carpenter in the village close by, took to himself a wife (his first wife having died), and became Tim Rokens' boon companion and bosom friend. As {{for the rest of the}} crew of the Red Eric, they went their several ways, got into separate ships, and were never again re-assembled together; but nearly all of them came at separate times, in the course of years, to visit their old captain and shipmates in the Red Eric at Whale Brae.|$|E
6000|$|No craft {{larger than}} a canoe can ride near Zayla. After bumping once or twice against the coral reefs, it was {{considered}} advisable for our good ship, the Sahalat, <b>to</b> <b>cast</b> <b>anchor.</b> My companions caused me to dress, put me with my pipe and other necessaries into a cock-boat, and, wading through the water, shoved it to shore. Lastly, at Bab el Sahil, the Seaward or Northern Gate, they proceeded to array themselves in the bravery of clean Tobes and long daggers strapped round the waist; each man also slung his targe to his left arm, and {{in his right hand}} grasped lance and javelin. At the gate we were received by a tall black spearman with a [...] "Ho there! to the governor;" [...] and a crowd of idlers gathered to inspect the strangers. Marshalled by the warder, we traversed the dusty roads--streets they could not be called--of the old Arab town, ran the gauntlet of a gaping mob, and finally entering a mat door, found ourselves {{in the presence of the}} governor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quiet, you scugs," [...] he cried, [...] "or I'll <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> in you;" [...] and at {{once the}} din was hushed. [...] "Are all the {{children}} chained, so that they cannot fly away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At last, {{however, the}} weather cleared, {{and two days}} later the [...] "Falcon" [...] <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> at Spithead. The next day the crew were paid off, and the vessel taken into dock for much-needed repairs.|$|R
6000|$|... 'All my fault. Some rhodomontade of mine {{about not}} letting her marry had <b>cast</b> <b>anchor</b> in her dear little ridiculous heart, {{and it is}} well I turned up before she had quite {{dissolved}} herself away.' ...|$|R
