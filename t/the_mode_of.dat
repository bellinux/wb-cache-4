30|$|It {{is seen in}} Figure 1 {{that for}} the C̃-sequence, the square and product modes are {{accurately}} determined, whereas <b>the</b> original signal <b>modes</b> are often undetected at this SNR level. Moreover, {{it is found that}} <b>the</b> square <b>modes</b> are estimated with better accuracy than <b>the</b> product <b>modes.</b> Note that it is easy to identify and utilize <b>the</b> square <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signal for estimating <b>the</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying signal. First the square-roots <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> estimated <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C̃-sequence are to be computed, then the complex amplitudes are to be estimated for all these computed <b>modes</b> utilizing <b>the</b> original signal sequence (Cadzow and Wu 1987). Selecting <b>the</b> original signal <b>modes</b> for M larger amplitudes will then be relatively straightforward. Note that in this way, <b>the</b> signal <b>modes</b> will be determined utilizing <b>the</b> square <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C̃-sequence. Thus, it should be the strategy that <b>the</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying signal are to be determined utilizing the accurate estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> square <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C̃-sequence, because the estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signal <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C̃-sequence may be inaccurate when the signal samples are corrupted with noise.|$|R

5|$|Indium is {{produced}} exclusively as a by-product during {{the processing of}} the ores of other metals. Its main source material are sulfidic zinc ores, where it is mostly hosted by sphalerite. Minor amounts are probably also extracted from sulfidic copper ores. During the roast-leach-electrowinning process of zinc smelting, indium accumulates in the iron-rich residues. From these, it can be extracted in different ways. It may also be recovered directly from the process solutions. Further purification is done by electrolysis. The exact process varies with <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> operation of the smelter.|$|E

5|$|Following its predecessors, Brawl uses {{a battle}} system {{unlike that of}} typical {{fighting}} games. Players can choose from a large selection of characters, each attempting to knock their opponents off the screen as they fight on various stages. The characters in Brawl include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as the well-known Mario and Pikachu. Instead of using traditional health bars that start at a maximum value and lose value, Brawl characters start the game with 0%; the value rises as they take damage and may rise over 100% {{to a maximum of}} 999%. As a character's percentage increases, the character flies further back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears from the screen, the character loses either a life, a point, or coins, depending on <b>the</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> play. Brawl includes a function which allows players to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each control method along with their chosen username.|$|E
5|$|Mating in the tawny {{nurse shark}} is known to occur from July to August off Madagascar. Adult females have one {{functional}} ovary and two functional uteruses. <b>The</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> reproduction is aplacental viviparity, meaning that the embryos hatch inside the uterus; females in captivity have been documented depositing up to 52 non-viable egg capsules, {{which has led to}} erroneous reports of this shark being oviparous. The egg capsules of this species are onion-shaped, with thin, brown, translucent shells. The {{tawny nurse shark}} is the only carpet shark in which there is oophagy: once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, they gorge on eggs produced by the mother and acquire the distended abdomen characteristic of such oophagous embryos. Unlike in mackerel sharks, the eggs consumed by the embryos are large and shelled rather than small and undeveloped. There is no evidence of sibling cannibalism as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
5|$|There are {{number of}} {{theories}} {{as to the}} origin of the shrine.

But according to S. Pathmanathan, the original Kataragama shrine was established as an adjunct guardian deity shrine to Skanda-Kumara within a Buddhist temple complex. This particular shrine then became idealized as the very spot where Valli met Murukan amongst local Tamils and Sinhalese, and Kataragama deviyo subsumed the identity of Skanda-Kumara and became a deity on his own right with rituals and pilgrimage. According to Pathmanathan, it happened after the 13th century CE when Murukan became popular amongst Tamils and before the 15th century CE when the poet Arunagirinathar identified the very location as a sacred spot.|$|E
