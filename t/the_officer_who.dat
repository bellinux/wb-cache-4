5|$|Jackson, Moore and Smith did not {{recognize}} Simon Harwood, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>who</b> struck Tomlinson, {{and according to the}} newspaper assumed he was with the City of London police. This was four days before The Guardian published the video. The inspector passed this information at 4:15 pm on 3 April to Detective Inspector Eddie Hall, the Met's point of contact for Tomlinson's death. Hall said he passed it to the City of London police before the first autopsy was conducted that day by Freddy Patel, which according to The Guardian began at 5 pm.|$|E
5|$|On September 19, 1861, Morehead, Louisville Courier editor Reuben T. Durrett, and a {{man named}} Martin W. Barr were arrested for disloyalty. The three were taken to Indianapolis, Indiana, and the next day, Louisville circuit court judge John Catron issued a writ of habeas corpus for Morehead. On September 24, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>who</b> had arrested Morehead told Catron that Secretary of War Simon Cameron had already ordered Morehead taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor. Shortly after this, a grand jury was convened but failed to return any charges against Morehead.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{had offered}} to {{nominate}} Eichelberger for {{a place at the}} Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth. Eichelberger joined 247 other officers there in July 1924. Since the students were seated alphabetically, he sat next to <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>who</b> topped the class, Major Dwight D. Eisenhower. Other students in the class included Joseph Stilwell, Leonard Gerow and Joseph T. McNarney. Eichelberger graduated as a Distinguished Graduate, one of the top quarter of the class, and stayed on at the Command and General Staff College as its Adjutant General. In 1929, he became a student at the Army War College. On graduation, he was posted back to the Adjutant General's Office in Washington, D.C.|$|E

5|$|Simon Harwood, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>who</b> struck Tomlinson, was {{a police}} constable with the Territorial Support Group (TSG) at Larkhall Lane police station in Lambeth, South London. Harwood had faced 10 {{complaints}} in 12 years, nine {{of which had been}} dismissed or unproven. The complaint that was upheld involved unlawful access to the Police National Computer. The complaints included a road-rage incident in or around 1998 while he was on sick leave, during which he reportedly tried to arrest the other driver, who alleged that Harwood had used unnecessary force. On Friday, 14 September 2001, before the case was heard by a discipline board, Harwood retired on medical grounds. Three days later, on Monday, 17 September, he rejoined the Met as a civilian computer worker.|$|E
5|$|Susan and David {{defy the}} group and go check on Mr. Griffin. The two find him dead {{as a result of}} {{coronary}} arrest after being unable to take his medication for angina. Mark convinces {{the rest of the group}} to cover up the death. He instructs Susan, who was the last one known to the police to see Mr. Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin kept looking at his watch during the conference and left with a pretty woman. Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin's car to the airport, but <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>who</b> gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin's, Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff's garage so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{bad feeling}} between the McCanns and the Polícia Judiciária reached such a height that Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>who</b> coordinated the {{investigation}} from May to October 2007, resigned in June 2008 {{to write a}} book alleging that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that the McCanns had faked an abduction. Amaral had been removed from the case in October 2007 after telling a Portuguese newspaper that the British police pursued leads helpful to only the McCanns. Three days after the case closed in July 2008, his book, Maddie: A Verdade da Mentira ("Maddie: The Truth of the Lie"), was published in Portugal by Guerra & Paz. By November 2008 it had sold 180,000 copies, and was later translated into six languages. A documentary based on the book was broadcast on TVI in Portugal in April 2009, watched by 2.2 million.|$|E

5|$|Lam Wing-kee (林榮基, age 60), {{the founder}} of Causeway Bay Books, has been missing since 24 October 2015. He habitually spent long hours at the {{bookshop}} and occasionally slept there. His wife filed a missing persons report with the police on 5 November and his family received {{a telephone call from}} him several hours later; he refused to reveal his whereabouts. When filing the police report, they were referred to the Immigration Department, who said it was against privacy policy to reveal a person's records of entry and exit of Hong Kong without the subject's permission. However, legislator James To said this was a reasonable request that was exempt from privacy policy. Police followed up on his case once, asking whether they had heard from him. His family allege that upon learning that he had contacted his family, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>who</b> called them informed that the case would be closed as resolved.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the loss}} of forts 54, 55 and 57, Krukowiecki was still {{convinced}} that the attack on Wola was a diversion, and refused to grant General Dembiński more reinforcements. Only General Ludwik Bogusławski, commanding officer of the 3rd Infantry Division, disregarded his orders and sent a single battalion of the 10th Line Infantry Regiment to Fort 56 as reinforcements. The battalion was led by Col. Piotr Wysocki, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>who</b> started the entire November Uprising. Dembiński abandoned Fort 58. Its artillery, along with 12 cannons and six rocket launchers from his reserves, was ordered to take positions {{between the first and}} second lines of defence, in front of Forts 21, 22 and 23. Around 9:00, when Russian forces were preparing to push further into the second line of Polish defences, Brigadier Józef Bem arrived to Wola with his 12 cannon and positioned them not far from the recently-lost Fort 54, right on the flank of Kreutz's infantry and Russian artillery shelling Fort 56. Eight more guns and four rocket launchers arrived to the northern flank of Wola and joined the defence of Fort 58. Around that time the combined artillery forces of both Russian infantry corps shifted their fire to Forts 56, 59 and 23. This time the Poles won the artillery duel. Despite Russian numerical superiority in guns and mortars, the Russian artillery suffered losses and was forced to withdraw, followed by infantry, likewise forced back into hiding behind the captured earthworks. Dembiński did not take advantage of this success, and the Polish infantry remained hidden behind fixed defences.|$|E
