The major attachment sites between the erythrocyte spectrin-actin cytoskeleton and the lipid bilayer are glycophorin C and band 3.

The majority of protein 4.1 is bound to glycophorin C.

40|$|ABSTRACT RNA {{polymerase}} II is {{the central}} eukaryotic enzyme in transcription from DNA to RNA. The dynamics of RNA polymerase II is described from molecular-dynamics simulations started from two crystal structures with open and closed trigger loop (TL) forms. Dynamic transitions between neutral and forward translocated states were observed, especially for the downstream DNA duplex. Dynamic rearrangements were also seen in the active site environment, including conformations in which the active site nucleotide assumed a possibly precatalytic conformation {{in close proximity to}} the <b>terminal</b> <b>30</b> -hydroxyl of the nascent RNA. Because nucleic acid translocation was observed primarily in the simulations with an open TL structure, whereas close approach of the active site nucleotide to the terminal RNA ribose predominantly occurred in the closed TL structure, a modified Brownian ratchet mechanism is proposed whereby thermally driven translocation is only possible with an open TL, and fidelity control and catalysis require TL closing...|$|E

This version is reproduced {{with the permission of}} publisher. The effects of action potential (AP) propagation delay times and the absolute refractory period upon the synchronization index are analysed for the integrate and fire neuron model, and the results are compared with recordings from auditory ganglion neurons and cochlear nucleus neurons. In the model the noisy periodic synaptic input to the neuron is summed and an AP is generated when the membrane potential reaches threshold. The output phase distribution (phase histogram) is calculated at the site at which the APs are generated. The AP propagation delay times along an axon are modelled using a periodically wrapped Gaussian distribution, with the width fitted from experimental data. This distribution is convolved with the calculated phase distribution to obtain the phase distribution at the axon <b>terminal.</b> <b>30</b> January - 2 FebruaryOpen Acces...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Kinematics {{measured}} {{during a}} short arc quadriceps knee extension exercise were compared in the knees of functionally unstable ACL-deficient patients, these patients ’ uninjured knees, and uninjured control subjects ’ knees. Cine phase contrast dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, {{in combination with}} amodel-based tracking algorithm developed by the authors, {{was used to measure}} tibiofemoral kinematics as the subjects performed the active, supine posture knee extension exercise in the <b>terminal</b> <b>30</b> degrees of motion. Two determinants of tibiofemoral motion weremeasured: anterior/posterior location of the tibia relative to the femur, and axial rotation of the tibia relative to the femur. We hypothesized that more anterior tibial positioning, as well as differences in axial tibial rotation patterns,would be observed inACL-deficient (ACL-D) kneeswhen compared to uninjured knees. Multifactor ANOVA analyses were used to determine the dependence of the kinematic variables on (i) side (injured vs. uninjured,matched by subject in the control group), (ii) flexion angle measured at five-degree increments, and (iii) subject group (ACL-injured vs. control). Statistically significant anterior translation and external tibial rotation (screw home motion) accompanying knee extension were found. The ACL-D knees of the injured group exhibited significantly more anterior tibial positioning than the uninjured knees of these subjects (averag...|$|E

40|$|An expanded, highly dynamic {{denatured}} {{state of}} staphylococcal nuclease exhibits a native-like topology in the apparent absence of tight packing and fixed hydrogen bonds (Gillespie JR, Shortle D, 1997, J Mol Biol 268 : 158 - 169, 170 - 184). To address the physical {{basis of the}} long-range spatial ordering of this molecule, we probe the effects of perturbations of the sequence and solution conditions on the local chain dynamics of a denatured 101 -residue fragment that is missing the first three beta strands. Structural interactions between chain segments are inferred from correlated changes in the motional behavior of residues monitored by 15 N NMR relaxation measurements. Restoration of the sequence corresponding to the first three beta strands significantly increases the average order of all chain segments that form the five strand beta barrel including loops but {{has no effect on}} the carboxy <b>terminal</b> <b>30</b> residues. Addition of the denaturing salt sodium perchlorate enhances ordering over the entire sequence of this fragment. Analysis of seven different substitution mutants points to a complex set of interactions between the hydrophobic segment corresponding to beta strand 5 and the remainder of the chain. General patterns in the data suggest there is a hierarchy of native-like interactions that occur transiently in the denatured state and are consistent with the overall topology of the denatured state ensemble being determined by many coupled local interactions rather than a few highly specific long-range interactions...|$|E

40|$|The latent {{membrane}} protein 1 (LMP 1) oncogene {{is one of}} the major proteins synthesized by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and is expressed in Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells of EBV-associated Hodgkin's disease (HD). We have studied the effect of this oncoprotein on the formation of RS cells in the EBV-negative HD cell lines L- 428 and KM-H 2 as well as on the formation of multinucleated cells in the mononuclear human embryonic kidney cell line 293. LMP 1 prototype (B 95 - 8) and its naturally occurring carboxy <b>terminal</b> <b>30</b> base pair deletion variant LMP 1 -del were transfected into the cell lines and cytocentrifuge preparations were analysed after 24, 48, 72, 144, 216, and 240 h. While no oncoprotein expression was seen in the KM-H 2 cell lines, expression of LMP 1 and LMP 1 -del was observed in the L- 428 and 293 cell lines. In the HD cell line L- 428 oncoprotein expression was infrequent but when observed was very strong and preferentially associated with multinucleated RS cell morphology (71 % of LMP 1 positive cells). This is in contrast with the untransfected or transfected but not expressing cells where intermediate mononuclear elements predominated over multinucleated RS cells (< 3 %). Frequent oncoprotein expression was observed in the 293 cells and again was associated with multinuclearity. These LMP 1 expressing 293 giant cells showed strong expression of ICAM- 1 (CD 54), not detectable in the untransfected cells. In the LMP 1 -del transfectants giant cells with more than four nuclei were frequently observed. However, giant cells were much less frequent in 293 cells transfected with the amino terminal deletion variant of LMP 1 or the lytic form of LMP 1, known to induce low NF-kappa B activation compared to the LMP 1 prototype. Therefore, LMP 1 mediated NF-kappa B activation appears to be involved in polycaria formation. The strong association of LMP 1 expression with multinuclearity in a genetically unstable condition -the L- 428 and 293 cells show multiple chromosomal abnormalities-suggests that this oncoprotein including its naturally occurring carboxy terminal deletion variant promote the formation of multinuclear cells, in particular of RS cells in EBV-associated HD...|$|E
