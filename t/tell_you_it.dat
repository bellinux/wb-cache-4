500|$|Sunday was {{a passionate}} {{supporter}} of World War I. In 1918 he said, [...] "I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> is [...] Bill against Woodrow, Germany against America, Hell against Heaven." [...] Sunday raised {{large amounts of}} money for the troops, sold war bonds, and stumped for recruitment.|$|E
500|$|Recording artist Nicki Minaj {{discussed}} the song {{during an interview}} with Rap-Up magazine, saying [...] "When I <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> gives me life, like, it gives me life. Her voice is effortless. It's badass, like, 'I know I'm the best.' I love the melody, I love the cadence. It's playful, but it's just so in-your-face. It's dope and it's creative." ...|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E
500|$|The jury began {{deliberations}} on November 17, 2010. Scheduled {{proceedings of}} the case met delays because of increased security at the courthouse. After two days of deliberations, all but one juror had voted to convict Guandique. On the third day, the jury asked Judge Gerald Fisher to clarify the definition of assault. Fisher responded that any physical injury could legally be considered an assault, regardless of how small. On November 22, 2010, the jury found Guandique guilty of both remaining counts of first-degree murder. After the trial, a juror said the testimony of Morales was decisive in reaching the verdict. The conviction was called a [...] "miracle" [...] for having been reached with only circumstantial evidence. Gladys Weatherspoon, who had previously represented Guandique in the 2001 assault cases, stated that she was troubled by the jury's verdict: [...] "I just think {{they were going to}} convict anyway.... They felt bad for that woman, the mom. She's sitting in there every day." [...] At a post-trial press conference, Susan Levy said, [...] "There's {{always going to be a}} feeling of sadness. I can surely <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>it</b> ain't closure." [...] Since the conclusion of the trial, Susan Levy has acted to keep photographic evidence of her daughter's remains sealed from the news media.|$|E
500|$|The Guitar Trio {{continued}} touring in 1980. De Lucía reportedly {{suffered from}} headaches and backaches while performing because {{he found it}} difficult to improvise and follow McLaughlin and Coryell's advanced knowledge of jazz improvisation. Paco professed, [...] "Some people assume that they were learning from me, but I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> was me learning from them. I have never studied music, I am incapable of studying harmony—I don't have the discipline, playing with McLaughlin and Di Meola was about learning these things." [...] In 1981, Coryell was replaced with Di Meola, and The Guitar Trio released one of their most successful records, Friday Night in San Francisco, which sold over 1 million copies and generated a significant interest in flamenco music in America and Europe. It featured an extended combination of Mediterranean Sundance and Río Ancho; this became arguably the piece most associated with the musicians. De Lucía also formed the Paco de Lucía Sextet in 1981 (which included his brothers Ramón and Pepe), and released the first of its three albums that same year. On 30 August 1981, de Lucía performed a solo set at St. Goarshausen in Germany, where he performed Monasterio de Sal and Montino among others and later performed with The Guitar Trio. The event was broadcast on national WDR television.|$|E

500|$|The Braves {{opened the}} third inning with {{back-to-back}} singles by Ozzie Virgil and Terry Blocker. Hershiser responded by striking out opposing pitcher Rick Mahler and Ron Gant and then retiring Jeff Blauser on a flyball to left. In the seventh inning, a double by Andrés Thomas was followed with an error by Franklin Stubbs, giving the Braves runners at first and third. Hershiser loaded the bases with an intentional walk before retiring Mahler and Gant again. Gant's flyball sent Gibson to the outfield wall. Hershiser felt this was his worst outing of his six consecutive complete games saying: [...] "It was the worst I've thrown {{in the last five}} or six starts,...I was really inconsistent. I didn't have good stuff or location. I couldn't establish a pattern. I had to work hard adjusting and got away with pitches I wouldn't have if I was going badly." [...] The Dodgers' only run came in the ninth inning on what newspapers described as a successful hit and run play in which Mike Marshall on a 2-2 count doubled Kirk Gibson in from first base. However, as recalled by Marshall: [...] "Let me <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>it</b> wasn't a hit-and-run. [...] Gibby was probably going with two strikes. [...] We never would hit-and-run with us. [...] You can call it a run-and-hit." [...] Orel and wife Jamie, scheduled induced labor for the following day, an off day for the Dodgers.|$|E
2500|$|Later, however, upon {{meeting with}} the artist at a gallery, Stein's {{attitude}} had apparently changed: [...] "..ah I said catching him by the lapels of his coat and shaking him.[...].'it is all right you are doing this {{to get rid of}} everything that has been too much for you all right all right go on doing it but don't go on trying to make me <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> is poetry' and I shook him again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviews in the {{conservative}} press were more mixed. American economist Mark Skousen praised the film, writing in Human Events, [...] "The script is true to the philosophy of Ayn Rand's novel." [...] The Weekly Standard senior editor Fred Barnes noted that the film [...] "gets Rand's point across forcefully without too much pounding", that it is [...] "fast-paced" [...] {{when compared with the}} original novel's 1200-page length, and that it is [...] "at least as relevant today as it was when the novel was published in 1957." [...] Jack Hunter, contributing editor to The American Conservative, wrote, [...] "If you ask the average film critic about the new movie adaptation of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged they will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> is a horrible movie. If you ask the average conservative or libertarian they will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> is a great movie. Objectively, it is a mediocre movie at best. Subjectively, {{it is one of the}} best mediocre movies you'll ever see." [...] In the National Post, Peter Foster credited the movie for the daunting job of fidelity to the novel, wryly suggested a plot rewrite along the lines of comparable current events, and concluded, [...] "if it sinks without trace, its backers should at least be proud that they lost their own money." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 1966, Reynolds {{was honored}} with {{a night in}} his honor at a California Angels ballgame. At the time, Los Angeles Times {{columnist}} John Hall wrote:"The contributions and {{the accomplishments of the}} large man with the large smile have too long been taken for granted.. As a partner of Gene Autry, it is natural perhaps that his role would be overshadowed by the glamor of a movie box office king. … [...] But those closest to the scene will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>it</b> is Reynolds who is the dynamo of the gang ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{effect of}} Myrick's {{statement}} on Little Crow {{and his band}} was clear however. In a letter to General Sibley, Little Crow {{said it was a}} major reason for commencing war: [...] "Dear Sir – For what reason we have commenced this war I will <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>it</b> is on account of Maj. Galbrait [...] we made a treaty with the Government a big for what little we do get and then cant get it till our children was dieing with hunger – it is with the traders that commence Mr A J Myrick told the Indians that they would eat grass or their own dung." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{theme of}} the book, at least as {{perceived}} from its title, aroused immediate opposition within the United States. [...] A well known instance of this occurred during the 1996 presidential election when, during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Republican Party nominee Bob Dole said: [...] "... with all due respect, I am here to <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>it</b> does not take a village to raise a child. It takes a family to raise a child." [...] Criticism of Clinton's notion {{would continue to be}} made by American conservatives such as Rush Limbaugh, Andrea Tantaros, and Jonah Goldberg through the next two decades.|$|E

2500|$|Dee's Speculum or Mirror (an {{obsidian}} Aztec cult {{object in}} the shape of a hand-mirror, brought to Europe in the late 1520s), which was subsequently owned by Horace Walpole. Jennifer Rampling has claimed that Dee never actually owned this object. The item now residing in the British Museum was first attributed to Dee by Horace Walpole. Lord Frederick Campbell had brought [...] "a round piece of shining black marble in a leathern case" [...] to Walpole in an attempt to ascertain the object's provenance. According to Walpole, he responded saying [...] "Oh, Lord, I am the only man in England that can <b>tell</b> <b>you!</b> <b>It</b> is Dr. Dee's black stone". There is no explicit reference to the mirror in any of Dee's surviving writings. The provenance of the Museum's obsidian speculum, as well as the crystal ball, is in fact dubious.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 June 2011, Williams {{said that}} the British Government was {{committing}} Britain to [...] "radical, long-term policies for which no-one voted". Writing in the New Statesman magazine, Williams raised concerns about the coalition's health, education and welfare reforms. He said there was [...] "indignation" [...] {{due to a lack}} of [...] "proper public argument". He also {{said that the}} [...] "Big Society" [...] idea was viewed with [...] "widespread suspicion", noting also that [...] "we are still waiting for a full and robust account of what the Left would do differently and what a Left-inspired version of localism would look like". The article also said there was concern that the government would abandon its responsibility for tackling child poverty, illiteracy and poor access to the best schools. He also expressed concern about the [...] "quiet resurgence of the seductive language of 'deserving' and 'undeserving' poor" [...] and the steady pressure to increase [...] "what look like punitive responses to alleged abuses of the system". In response, David Cameron said that he “profoundly disagreed” with Williams's claim that the government was forcing through “radical policies for which no one voted”. Cameron said that the government was acting in a “good and moral” fashion and defended the “Big Society” and the Coalition’s deficit reduction, welfare and education plans. “I am absolutely convinced that our policies are about actually giving people a greater responsibility and greater chances in their life, and I will defend those very vigorously”, he said. “By all means let us have a robust debate but I can <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>it</b> will always be a two-sided debate.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Australian {{said that}} the {{production}} team The Neptunes were to work with Aguilera on the album. In an interview with HitQuarters, Dr. Dre protege Focus... said, [...] "We did a song and an interlude together." [...] He produced the beats for the track [...] "Sex for Breakfast," [...] which were then worked on by Aguilera and producer Noel [...] "Detail" [...] Fisher. Focus... got involved with the project because he and Aguilera share a loyal, long-time engineer in Oscar Ramirez; Ramirez suggested and arranged the pairing. Of the experience Focus... commented, [...] " [...] knows exactly what she is looking for and {{is not afraid to}} <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> <b>It</b> was the first project I've ever worked on where someone sent me examples and showed me exact parts in the song they were looking for." [...] Aguilera announced on her E! special {{that she was going to}} be working with American dance-punk band Le Tigre. Aguilera said in August 2009, that she co-wrote tracks with British Tamil songwriter M.I.A. and Santigold, and according to the producer Tricky Stewart, Flo Rida would be featured on the album. Producer Polow da Don, who produced two of the four singles released from the project, was the only producer to be suggested by RCA and not contacted by Aguilera personally. Additionally Stewart and Claude Kelly wrote the song [...] "Glam", which was described as [...] "a hard club song that's about high fashion. It's really for the ladies about getting dressed and looking your best, working it in the club and getting glam and sexy before you go out. ... It will surprise people. I'm calling it a modern day [...] "Vogue." [...] I wouldn't say it unless I believed it." [...] Kelly also co-wrote three other tracks for the album, including the first two singles [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] and [...] "Woohoo". He described the four tracks as being [...] "up-tempo and fun, they're party anthems but at the same time have underlying messages." [...] Commenting on the experience of working with Aguilera, Kelly said, [...] "What people don't know about her is that she's actually a really good writer. She has good ideas, good melodies, good concepts ... She's really involved from the very beginning to the very end." ...|$|E
