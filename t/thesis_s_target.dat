40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{legal rules}} protecting minority shareholders in the acquiring firm’s home country influence corporate governance activities in U. <b>S.</b> <b>targets.</b> Using {{a sample of}} 257 partial acquisitions of U. S. firms by foreign firms during the period 1981 - 1999, {{we find that the}} likelihood of such governance activities is positively related to the shareholder rights score of the acquiring firm country. This positive relationship, however, is mainly driven by the subsample of acquisitions in which foreign investors do not have any business relationships with U. <b>S.</b> <b>targets</b> (unrelated foreign investors). Abnormal announcement returns for U. <b>S.</b> <b>targets</b> of unrelated foreign investors also display a strong positive association with the level of shareholder rights protection in the acquiring firm country. The result suggests that the stock market takes the increase in the frequency of a foreign acquiring firm’s value-enhancing future governance activities for U. <b>S.</b> <b>targets</b> into account when assessing their market values...|$|R

40|$|We hypothesize {{and find}} {{evidence}} consistent with foreign firms being tax-favored acquirers of U. <b>S.</b> <b>targets</b> with greater locked-out earnings {{because they can}} avoid the U. S. tax on repatriations. This effect is economically significant; a standard deviation increase in lockout {{is associated with a}} 12 % relative increase in the likelihood that an acquirer is foreign. We also find evidence that foreign acquirers of the target firms {{are more likely to be}} residents of countries that use territorial tax systems, as the tax advantages for a foreign firm acquiring a U. <b>S.</b> <b>target</b> with locked-out earnings are even greater for these acquirers...|$|R
40|$|We examine post-takeover {{restructuring}} {{activity and}} the sources of gains in large U. <b>S.</b> <b>targets</b> of foreign acquirers. We find that layoffs and sell-offs are less important in justifying the target premium in foreign takeovers than in domestic takeovers. In contrast, U. <b>S.</b> <b>targets</b> in foreign takeovers subsequently make more post-takeover investments than those in domestic takeovers. The likelihood of these post-takeover restructuring activities is significantly influenced by target characteristics. Finally, the U. S. Tax Reform Act of 1986 has had a significant positive effect on target returns. These {{results suggest that the}} realization of synergy is the main motive behind foreign takeovers. ...|$|R

Unlike prior studies that focus on short-term stock price reactions of target firms, it is possible to undertake this long-term analysis of performance by identifying targets that survive as independent entities because of partial acquisitions. The findings suggest that targets of Japanese bidders either perform no differently from <b>targets</b> of U. <b>S.</b> bidders, or possibly even underperform. Thus, the evidence does not support the oft-claimed superiority of Japanese management and corporate governance system.

Bibliography: leaves [22]- 23. v, 33 l graphs, tablesThe {{present study}} {{investigated}} the generalization of verbal operant conditioning using a group discussion paradigm. The hypotheses were: Hypothesis A: Verbal output of <b>Target</b> !<b>s</b> would increase with the presentation of positive reinforcers for talking and punishment for silence. Hypothesis B: Later testing of <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> in new groups would show generalization of increased verbal output. Hypothesis C: Later testing of <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> in new groups would show the reinforced <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> being rated as performing {{a greater degree of}} leadership function than non-reinforced <b>Target</b> <b>Ss.</b> Hypothesis D: The degree of generalization of verbal output would be a function of time, with <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> retested one day later showing more generalization than <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> retested one week later. Ss were female volunteers from an introductory psychology course. Twenty-four groups of three Ss were tested in a soundproofed room, with a hooded panel containing a red and green light situated {{on the table in front}} of each S. Ss were assigned to either a Reinforced or Non-Reinforced treatment, and each group met on three successive days for 30 minutes each day. On Day 1 no reinforcement was presented, in order to establish the operant level of verbal output for each Ss who spoke the least amount of time within their respective groups were selected as the <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> (N = 24). On Days 2 & 3, Ss under the Reinforced treatment were instructed that they would receive a green light when they facilitated the group discussion and a red light when they hindered the group process. Actually <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> were positively reinforced (green light) for talking and punished (red light) for silence, while Non- <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> were punished for talking. Ss under the Non-Reinforced treatment received neither positive reinforcement or punishment. On Day 4, which occurred either one or seven days after Day 3, <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> were assigned to new groups with Ss who had not participated in the first discussion group. <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> received neither positive reinforcement or punishment during Day 4. At the end of Day 4, Ss ranked each other on a sociometric questionnaire concerned with leadership. Hypothesis A was supported by the results, with <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> showing an increase in verbal output under the Reinforced treatment (F 2, 44 = 20. 93, p. 05). Hypothesis B was not supported, with Reinforced <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> showing no significant difference (p). 05) in verbal output from Non-Reinforced <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> on Day 4. However, <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> showed a significant increase of verbal output from Day 1 (First Group) to Day 4 (Second Group), for both the Reinforced and Non-Reinforced treatments (F 1, 20 = 22. 77, p (. 01). Hypothesis C was not supported. Reinforced <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> did not show a significant difference (p). 05) between Day 1 (First Group) and Day 4 (Second Group) in leadership function, whereas Non-Reinforced <b>Target</b> !<b>s</b> showed a significant increase (F 1, 20 = 8. 71, p. 05) from <b>Target</b> <b>Ss</b> retested one week later...|$|R

40|$|We {{extend the}} {{existing}} literature on the factors explaining the value of acquired firms by examining the effect of corporate governance and other characteristics of Japanese and U. S. acquirers on the long-term post-acquisition stock and accounting performance of their U. <b>S.</b> <b>targets</b> over 1980 - 2000, a period during which both U. S. and Japanese economies experienced both superior and poor performances. In addition to analyzing the bidder - target relationship in general, focus on Japanese bidders permits us to investigate the role of unique Japanese characteristics: keiretsu membership, cross-holding and ties to a main bank. The unresolved debate on {{the efficiency of the}} U. S. versus Japanese corporate governance system developed in the early 1990 s, following the slowdown in the U. S. and boom in the Japanese economy. Critics claim that the main banks do nothing special and that the whole discussion is theory driven. In addition, the hypothesized advantages of the Japanese governance system, namely cross-holding, negligible shareholding, latitude and long-term focus of managers, may lead to greater agency problems. For data availability reason we analyzed U. <b>S.</b> <b>targets</b> whose stock continued to independently trade {{for at least a year}} following the acquisition. To separate general and uniquely Japanese effects of bidders, a sample of U. <b>S.</b> <b>targets,</b> that independently existed following acquisition by U. S. bidders, were selected from the same industry and year in which Japanese acquired U. <b>S.</b> <b>targets.</b> Overall results suggest that better managed bidders with more resources positively affect the performance of smaller targets in related industries. In the presence of alternative methods for managing the agency problem the targets' leverage becomes more important as a source of funds than a tool to manage agency problem. The mixed results for the Japanese governance variables, expected positive for the main bank and unpredicted negative for the keiretsu and cross-holding, do not allow a clear-cut answer as to which governance system is dominant since the characteristics of the Japanese governance system have mixed effects on the corporate performance...|$|R
