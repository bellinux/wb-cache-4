5|$|A {{review in}} the The Moving Picture World said the comedy-drama as being {{pleasing}} to watch and full of action. However, {{the quality of the}} Princess films towards the end of its productions were not pleasing <b>the</b> <b>audiences.</b> The last Princess brand film, Just Kids would be released on April 9. The film is presumed to be lost.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>audiences</b> that {{we built}} for those campaigns {{are having a}} {{different}} experience. They’re having a collective experience in which they literally bring different pieces, one to the next, swap them back and forth, gossip about them. They have an element of cocreation and a collaborative nature that doesn’t really have an analog that I’ve been able to think of in the arts.|$|E
5|$|The {{film has}} seven songs {{composed}} by Devi Sri Prasad with the lyrics primarily penned by Chandrabose, Ravi Kumar Bhaskarabhatla, Kulasekhar and Sirivennela Sitaramasastri.

5000|$|The three {{aims of the}} orator, {{according}} to Cicero, are [...] "docere, delectare, et movere." [...] That is: to prove your thesis to <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> to delight <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> and to emotionally move <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> <b>The</b> emotional vividness of poetic language {{becomes part of the}} rhetorical tools in service of persuading <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> to your point of view.|$|R
5000|$|Orchestral Theatre II: Re (1992) {{expands the}} concept of ritual by {{involving}} <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> <b>The</b> orchestra is split, with the strings, brass, and percussion onstage, while the woodwinds surround <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> <b>The</b> score also calls for two conductors, with one facing the stage, and the other facing <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> <b>The</b> latter conductor cues <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> to hum along with the orchestra in certain sections of the music. The work's namesake derives from humming the solfège pitch [...] "re".|$|R
50|$|Audience {{inferior}} {{position is}} when <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> knows {{less than one}} or more of the characters in a narrative work. A key example is in murder mysteries, when the detective solves the crime before <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> were to solve the crime before <b>the</b> detective, <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> would lose all interest in following the story.|$|R
5|$|Ann Bannon {{was born}} Ann Weldy in Joliet, Illinois, in 1932. She {{grew up in}} nearby Hinsdale {{with her mother and}} stepfather, and had the {{responsibility}} of taking care of four siblings due to the family's financial problems. She took comfort in a vibrant imaginary life during this time and found solace in writing. Growing up, she was surrounded by music, particularly jazz, as her family hosted small recitals for friends and neighbors. One became a character in her books: a perennial bachelor named Jack who slung jokes and witticisms at <b>the</b> <b>audiences.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Actor and the Rube was {{the first}} {{production}} of the new Falstaff brand of the Thanhouser Company. The production was personally supervised by Edwin Thanhouser at the New Rochelle studio. The new Falstaff productions would {{take the place of}} the Princess brand films which were doing poorly with <b>the</b> <b>audiences.</b> The scenario was written by Philip Lonergan and the production was directed by Arthur Ellery. The single reel film was approximately 1,015 feet in length. The production included Thanhouser actors, such as Riley Chamberlin, and Princess brand actors such as Boyd Marshall. An advertisement for the film stated that Boyd Marshall and Riley Chamberlain were the lead actors in the production.|$|E
5|$|The ballet {{was first}} {{shown in the}} United States on 11 April 1930, when Massine's 1920 version was {{performed}} by the Philadelphia Orchestra in Philadelphia under Leopold Stokowski, with Martha Graham dancing {{the role of the}} Chosen One. The production moved to New York, where Massine was relieved to find <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> receptive, a sign, he thought, that New Yorkers were finally beginning to take ballet seriously. The first American-designed production, in 1937, was that of the Modern Dance exponent Lester Horton, whose version replaced the original pagan Russian setting with a Wild West background and the use of Native American dances.|$|E
5000|$|The three lifelines were 50:50, Ask <b>the</b> <b>Audience,</b> or Phone a Complete Stranger. Ask <b>the</b> <b>Audience</b> is immediate; <b>the</b> <b>audience's</b> answers can be {{instantly}} polled, because <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> {{already had}} a chance to enter their answers. Phone a Complete Stranger connected the contestant to a Cast Member outside the theater who found a guest to help.|$|R
50|$|The Butcher Episode: Paekjung, the butcher, dances {{around and}} taunts <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> He kills a bull and then starts {{trying to sell}} the heart and other organs to <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> <b>The</b> <b>audience</b> refuses and he shows {{frustration}} at the lack of success in selling off the parts by throwing tantrums and shouting at <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> He then raises the game by making an energetic attempt to sell the bull's testicles.

5|$|The film {{had its own}} {{share of}} controversies. A news report showcased the omnipresent piracy in the Telugu film {{industry}} by quoting the cheap prices at which the film was being sold. The film's lead actor, Siddharth even went on to request <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> to buy the original audio CD. The film's producer, Dil Raju, ensured a special code on each distributed print to track piracy with a warning for copyright violation which would incur a fine or a jail term.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{television}} channels, thousands {{of local and}} national radio stations, several dozen newspapers, a productive and profitable national cinema and a rapid growth of broadband Internet use all make up a very vibrant media industry in Turkey. In 2003 a total of 257 television stations and 1,100 radio stations were licensed to operate, and others operated without licenses. Of those licensed, 16 television and 36 radio stations reached national audiences. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> are shared among public broadcaster TRT and the network-style channels such as Kanal D, Show TV, ATV and Star TV. The broadcast media {{have a very high}} penetration as satellite dishes and cable systems are widely available. The Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) is the government body overseeing the broadcast media. By circulation, the most popular newspapers are Posta, Hürriyet, Sözcü, Sabah and Habertürk.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, A Town Where You Live manga volumes {{frequently}} {{appeared on}} weekly sales charts during their week of release. Jason Thompson praised A Town Where You Lives serious, mature tone and wrote that <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> will either like the series for its realism or criticize it as slow and mundane. Manga-News praised the series' introduction for being more realistic than the author's previous work, Suzuka, and the plot which {{was described as}} eventful. In later volumes, Manga-News criticized the plot for being predictable, encompassing cliché aspects of the genre, and for dragging its story. They also panned the characters' behavior, calling it implausible and inconsistent. Manga-News returned to positive reviews during the volumes involving Kyousuke Kazama; they praised the story arc for introducing a new setting, for breaking away from the usual classicism, and for surprising the readers {{for the first time}} in the series. Following this, Manga-News returned to negative reviews, echoing their previous points. AnimeLand had similar reactions. Initially, they were positive, praising the realistic protagonist, but further reviews repeated Manga-News' criticisms.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Audience</b> of <b>the</b> Singular explores and {{challenges}} the traditional role of <b>audiences.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Audience</b> of <b>the</b> Singular uses an interactive video game form to allow <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> {{to interact with}} the performance in real-time. Each time the game is played, new music is generated by a corpus-based, machine-learning system. <b>The</b> <b>audience</b> then collaborates with an arranger system and a virtual audience to play through their own personal musical performance. By utilizing the interactive, real-time nature of the video game, <b>The</b> <b>Audience</b> of <b>the</b> Singular removes <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> from its traditional role as a passive spectator, and instead places them in an active authorship role in their own unique performance...|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of Monroe's motivated sequence {{is that it}} emphasizes what <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> can do. Too often <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> feels like a situation is hopeless; Monroe's motivated sequence emphasizes <b>the</b> action <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> can take. It also helps <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> feel like <b>the</b> speaker knows the problem at hand and is listening to them instead of just tuning them out.|$|R
5|$|King Kalākaua trusted Rosenberg's {{skill as}} a fortune teller, {{perhaps because the}} way Rosenberg chanted in Hebrew {{reminded}} him of ancient Hawaiian rites. In January 1887, the king—who had become increasingly autocratic and was facing several scandals—granted Rosenberg a private audience at the palace. The king and Rosenberg became close, and routinely visited each other for several {{days at a time}} and held long conversations. During <b>the</b> <b>audiences,</b> Rosenberg told Bible stories and read from the Talmud. He began to teach the king basic Hebrew, and gave him an ornate Torah and yad that he had brought with him to Hawaii. He also claimed to have found references to Hawaii in ancient Hebrew texts, a statement that encouraged the king to restore aspects of Hawaiian religion. The king had previously sought instruction from several people he regarded as prophets and had established a society dedicated to the revival of native Hawaiian traditions. Finally, the king declared Rosenberg his kahuna-kilokilo, a royal soothsayer.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide variety}} of musical performances, {{whether or not they}} are artificially amplified (6, 7, 9, 10), all provide {{entertainment}} irrespective of whether the performance is from soloists (6), choral (2) or orchestral groups (5, 8), or ensemble (3). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. <b>The</b> <b>audiences</b> have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation (5, 8). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate (7, 9). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately (10).|$|E
5|$|West further broadened {{his musical}} palette on Graduation by not {{limiting}} {{himself to his}} customary use of samples and interpolation from classic soul records and instead drew influences from a far more eclectic range of music genres. Along with house music, Graduation contains samples and music elements of euro-disco, hard rock, electronica, lounge, progressive rock, synth-pop, electro, krautrock, dub, reggae, and dancehall. Also, {{for much of the}} third studio album, Kanye West modified his style of rapping and adopted a dilatory, exuberant flow in emulation of Bono's operatic vocal stylings. West altered his vocabulary, he utilized less of the percussive, rhythmic consonants in favor of the more smoother, melodic vowel sounds. In addition to U2, West drew inspiration from other arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin for the melodies and chord progressions of his songs. In terms of lyricism, he simplifies some of his rhymes after touring with The Rolling Stones on their A Bigger Bang concert tour and discovering he could not captivate <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> as well with his most complex lyrical themes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Audience</b> - <b>the</b> {{role and}} value of <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> <b>The</b> concept of <b>audience</b> can be {{evaluated}} historically or critically. <b>The</b> <b>audience</b> may be specific such as art historians or critics, or {{other members of the}} public such as students, teachers, art buyers, etc. Or <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> may be abstract as when notions of [...] "viewing" [...] and [...] "authorship" [...] come into it. Artworks themselves are static, but <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> and their interpretation changes over time.|$|R
50|$|In some plays all of {{the actors}} may adopt the same {{attitude}} towards <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> (for example, <b>the</b> entire cast of a production of a Chekhovian drama will usually ignore <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> until <b>the</b> curtain call); in other plays the performers create a range of different relationships towards <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> (for example, most Shakespearean dramas have certain characters who frequently adopt a downstage ‘platea’ playing position that is {{in direct contact with}} <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> while other characters behave as if unaware of <b>the</b> <b>audience’s</b> presence).|$|R
50|$|During the intermission, {{a couple}} of things happen {{involving}} <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> In <b>the</b> original production, the cast joined <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> for wine and bread.

5|$|Bon Jovi's third album, Slippery When Wet (1986), mixed {{hard rock}} with a pop {{sensitivity}} {{and spent a}} total of 8 weeks {{at the top of}} the Billboard 200 album chart, selling 12 million copies in the US while becoming the first hard rock album to spawn three top 10 singles — two of which reached number one. The album has been credited with widening <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> for the genre, particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated audience, and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade. The anthemic The Final Countdown (1986) by Swedish group Europe was an international hit, reaching number eight on the US charts while hitting the top 10 in nine other countries. This era also saw more glam-infused American hard rock bands come to the forefront, with both Poison and Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum début albums in 1986. Van Halen released 5150 (1986), their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, which was number one in the US for three weeks and sold over 6 million copies. By the second half of the decade, hard rock had become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Following {{its premiere}} in early September at the Toronto International Film Festival, The Shawshank Redemption began a limited North American release on September 23, 1994. During its opening weekend, the film earned $727,000 from 33 theaters—an average of $22,040 per theater. Following a Hollywood {{tradition}} of visiting different theaters {{on opening night}} to see <b>the</b> <b>audiences</b> view their film live, Darabont and Glotzer went to the Cinerama Dome, but found no one there. Glotzer claimed that the pair actually sold two tickets outside the theater with the promise that if the buyers {{did not like the}} film, they could ask Castle Rock for a refund. While critics praised the film, Glotzer believed that a lackluster review from the Los Angeles Times pushed crowds away. It received a wide release on October 14, 1994, expanding to a total of 944 theaters to earn $2.4 million—an average of $2,545 per theater—finishing as the number nine film of the weekend, behind sex-comedy Exit to Eden ($3 million), and just ahead of Quiz Show ($2.1 million), which was in its fifth week at the cinemas. The film closed in late November 1994, after 10 weeks with an approximate total gross of $16 million. It was considered a box office bomb, failing to recoup its $25 million budget, not including marketing costs and the cinema exhibitors' cuts.|$|E
