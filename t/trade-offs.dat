5|$|A recent test of {{this model}} {{involved}} a reciprocal transplants of seedlings of 20 species of trees between clay soils (nutrient rich) and white sand (nutrient poor) to determine whether <b>trade-offs</b> between growth rate and defenses restrict species to one habitat. When planted in white sand and protected from herbivores, seedlings originating from clay outgrew those originating from the nutrient-poor sand, but {{in the presence of}} herbivores the seedlings originating from white sand performed better, likely due to their higher levels of constitutive carbon-based defenses. These finding suggest that defensive strategies limit the habitats of some plants.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofers {{are made}} up of one or more woofers mounted in a {{loudspeaker}} enclosure—often made of wood—capable of withstanding air pressure while resisting deformation. Subwoofer enclosures {{come in a variety of}} designs, including bass reflex (with a port or vent), using a subwoofer and one or more passive radiator speakers in the enclosure, acoustic suspension (sealed enclosure), infinite baffle, horn-loaded, and bandpass designs, representing unique <b>trade-offs</b> with respect to efficiency, low frequency range, cabinet size and cost. Passive subwoofers have a subwoofer driver and enclosure and they are powered by an external amplifier. Active subwoofers include a built-in amplifier.|$|E
5|$|The {{changes to}} the DDL design {{reflected}} shifting requirements and poor project management by the Navy. The development of an Australian-designed ship customised for Australian conditions caused naval officers to include requirements beyond those which were essential. These changes were made without regard for costs, as the team tasked with developing the specifications was not also responsible for the ships' final price and delivery schedule. The Navy's failure to maintain control of the design requirements and make cost-performance <b>trade-offs</b> {{may have been due}} to its limited experience in overseeing the design of new warships.|$|E
40|$|The {{aims of the}} multi-objective design {{optimization}} are to find the pareto optimal solutions, and are also to analyze the <b>trade-off</b> between the objectives. The interactive multi-objective {{design optimization}} based on the Satisficing <b>Trade-Off</b> Method (STOM) is used in this paper. Especially, the <b>trade-off</b> matrix to analyze the <b>trade-off</b> between objectives quantitatively is introduced. Each element of <b>trade-off</b> matrix consists of the projection matrix of active constraints and the gradient of objective functions. Additionally, {{it is possible to}} determine the new aspiration level by using the <b>trade-off</b> matrix. To obtain the new aspiration level, the compromise point and solution are defined by using the <b>trade-off</b> ratio. To obtain the compromise point, the designer input the <b>trade-off</b> ratio between objectives and can obtain the new aspiration level. It is also possible to apply the <b>trade-off</b> matrix to the automatic <b>trade-off</b> method, which is a method to determine the new aspiration level.

40|$|Metapopulation {{theory for}} the {{evolution}} of specialisation is virtually absent. In this article, therefore, we study a metapopulation model for consumers with a fitness <b>trade-off</b> between two habitats. We focus on effects of habitat abundance, dispersal rate and <b>trade-off</b> strength on {{the evolution of}} specialisation under two types of <b>trade-off.</b> Adaptation affects either the intrinsic growth rates r or the carrying capacities K. Depending on dispersal rate and <b>trade-off</b> strength, evolution can result in one generalist, one specialist or two specialist types. Higher dispersal rate and a weaker <b>trade-off</b> favour the evolution of a generalist, for both <b>trade-off</b> structures. However, we also find differences between the two <b>trade-off</b> structures. Our results are qualitatively similar to analyses of two-patch models, suggesting that insights from such simpler models can be extrapolated to metapopulation models. Additional effects, however, occur because in classical metapopulations patch lifetime depends on extinction rate. Counterintuitively, this favours the evolution of specialisation when the <b>trade-off</b> affects r...|$|R

Sargent and Wallace's policy ineffectiveness proposition found that economic agents would anticipate inflation and adjust to higher price levels before the influx of monetary stimulus could boost employment and output. Only unanticipated monetary policy could increase employment, and no central bank could systematically use monetary policy for expansion without economic agents catching on and anticipating price changes before they could have a stimulative impact.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{camouflage}} {{is the use}} of camouflage {{on military}} aircraft to make them more difficult to see, whether on the ground or in the air. Given the possible backgrounds and lighting conditions, no single scheme works in every situation. A common approach has been a form of countershading, the aircraft being painted in a disruptive pattern of ground colors such as green and brown above, sky colors below. For faster and higher-flying aircraft, sky colors have sometimes been used all over, while helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft used close to the ground are often painted entirely in ground camouflage. Aircraft flying by night have often been painted black, but this actually made them appear darker than the night sky, leading to paler night camouflage schemes. There are <b>trade-offs</b> between camouflage and aircraft recognition markings, and between camouflage and weight. Accordingly, visible light camouflage has been dispensed with when air superiority was not threatened or when no significant aerial opposition was anticipated.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} effect of {{discontinuous}} periodic host absence {{on the evolution of}} pathogen transmission rates by using R 0 maximisation techniques. The physiological consequence of an increased transmission rate can be either an increased virulence, i. e. there is a transmission-virulence <b>trade-off</b> or ii) a reduced between season survival, i. e. there is a transmission-survival <b>trade-off.</b> The results reveal that the type of <b>trade-off</b> determines the direction of selection, with relatively longer periods of host absence selecting for higher transmission rates {{in the presence of a}} <b>trade-off</b> between transmission and virulence but lower transmission rates in the presence of a <b>trade-off</b> between transmission and between season survival. The fact that for the transmissionvirulence <b>trade-off</b> both <b>trade-off</b> parameters operate during host presence whereas for the transmission-survival <b>trade-off</b> one operates during host presence (transmission) and the other (survival) during the period of host absence is the main cause for this difference in selection direction. Moreover, the period of host absence seems to be the key determinant of the pathogen's transmission rate. Comparing plant patho-systems with contrasting biological features suggests that airborne plant pathogens respond differently to longer periods of host absence than soil-borne plant pathogens...|$|R
