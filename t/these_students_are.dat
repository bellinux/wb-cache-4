40|$|Using a {{questionnaire}} which asseses premenstrual syndrome and dysmenorrhea symptoms, we investigated 308 college female students in December, 2001. Ninety-nine percent of <b>these</b> <b>students</b> <b>were</b> suffering from premenstrual syndrome, and all <b>students</b> <b>were</b> suffering from dysmenorrhea symptoms. Comparing symtoms of premenstrual syndrome with dysmenorrhea, {{there are a}} lot of somatic symptoms in both conditions, but premenstrual syndrome has more mental symptoms than dysmenorrhea. Symptomatically, it is recognised that symptoms of premenstrual syndrome are different from symptoms of dysmenorrhea. In daily and school life, seventy nine percent of <b>these</b> <b>students</b> <b>were</b> disturbed by premenstrual syndrome. It is necessary that not only dysmenorrhea but also premenstrual syndrome are taught to school children in school health education and mental counseling...|$|R
25|$|Many {{intensive}} behavioral interventions {{rely heavily}} on discrete trial teaching (DTT) methods, which use stimulus-response-reward techniques to teach foundational skills such as attention, compliance, and imitation. However, children have problems using DTT-taught skills in natural environments. <b>These</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> also taught with naturalistic teaching procedures to help generalize these skills. In functional assessment, a common technique, a teacher formulates a clear description of a problem behavior, identifies antecedents, consequences, and other environmental factors that influence and maintain the behavior, develops hypotheses about what occasions and maintains the behavior, and collects observations to support the hypotheses. A few more-comprehensive ABA programs use multiple assessment and intervention methods individually and dynamically.|$|E
