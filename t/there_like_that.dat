5|$|Microgale macpheei {{is known}} {{only from the}} cave of Andrahomana. Its past {{presence}} <b>there,</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of the extinct rodent Hypogeomys australis, suggests formerly more mesic (wet) conditions around the cave, which is currently in a dry area. In addition to M.macpheei, three other tenrecs have been described from subfossil material, but none are currently recognized as valid species; thus, M.macpheei is at present the only known Recently extinct tenrec species. However, there is a remnant patch of mesic forest near Andrahomana, where a population of M.macpheei may survive. Although no radiocarbon dating {{has been carried out}} on M.macpheei remains, bones of the rodent Macrotarsomys petteri from layers in the same cave deposit bracketing those where M.macpheei was found yield dates of around 2480 and 1760 Before Present.|$|E

2500|$|Unterberger {{concluded}} that the song [...] "is about a relationship that’s troubled by matters of emotional and/or physical distance, but that the singer feels strongly enough about {{to keep it going}} just the same…until the chorus, at which point he decides that it’s not worth the trouble. No, it doesn’t make sense, but it’s still stirring, beautiful in its own weird way, and undeniably unforgettable. And frankly, we wouldn’t want it any other way." [...] Kevin Richardson, member of the band, explained in an interview that, [...] "Ultimately the song really doesn't make much sense." [...] Richardson also wrote that Max Martin, who co-wrote and co-produced the song, barely spoke English. [...] "His English has gotten much better, but at the time...," [...] said Richardson. [...] "There are a lot of songs out <b>there</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> don't make sense," [...] he continues, [...] "but make you feel good when you sing along to them, and that's one of them." ...|$|E

60|$|As to your {{numerical}} weakness. I mentioned some figures awhile ago--500,00--as the Jewish {{population of}} Germany. I will add some more--6,000,000 in Russia, 5,000,000 in Austria, 250,000 in the United States. I take them from memory; I read {{them in the}} 'Encyclopaedia Brittannica' ten or twelve years ago. Still, I am entirely sure of them. If those statistics are correct, my argument is {{not as strong as}} it ought to be as concerns America, but it still has strength. It is plenty strong enough as concerns Austria, for ten years ago 5,000,000 was nine per cent of the empire's population.

60|$|Her husband {{gave her}} a glance of {{intelligent}} appreciation; but Kenby was too simply, too densely content with the situation to know the value {{of what she had}} done. She thought he must certainly explain, as he walked back with her to the Swan, whether he had misrepresented her to Mrs. Adding, or Mrs. Adding had misunderstood him. Somewhere there had been an error, or a duplicity which it was now useless to punish; and Kenby was so apparently unconscious of it that she had not the heart to be cross with him. She heard Miss Triscoe behind her with March laughing in the gayety which the escape from her father seemed to inspire in her. She was promising March to go with him in the morning to see the Emperor and Empress of Germany arrive at the station, and he was warning her that if she laughed <b>there,</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> she would subject him to fine and imprisonment. She pretended that she would like to see him led off between two gendarmes, but consented to be a little careful when he asked her how she expected to get back to her hotel without him, if such a thing happened.|$|E
6000|$|I fancy the Imperator {{standing}} {{on the steps of}} the temple (erected by Titus) on the Mons Frumentarius, and addressing the citizens: [...] "Quirites!" [...] he says, [...] "in our campaign of six months, we have been engaged six times, and in each action have taken near upon a HUNDRED THOUSAND PRISONERS. Go to! What are other magazines compared to our magazine? (Sound, trumpeter!) What banner is <b>there</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of Cornhill? You, philosopher yonder!" [...] (he shirks under his mantle.) [...] "Do you know what it is to have a hundred and ten thousand readers? A hundred thousand readers? a hundred thousand BUYERS!" [...] (Cries of [...] "No!"--"Pooh!" [...] "Yes, upon my honor!" [...] "Oh, come!" [...] and murmurs of applause and derision)--"I say more than a hundred thousand purchasers--and I believe AS MUCH AS A MILLION readers!" [...] (Immense sensation.) [...] "To these have we said an unkind word? We have enemies; have we hit them an unkind blow? Have we sought to pursue party aims, to forward private jobs, to advance selfish schemes? The only persons to whom wittingly we have given pain are some who have volunteered for our corps--and of these volunteers we have had THOUSANDS." [...] (Murmurs and grumbles.) [...] "What commander, citizens, could place all these men!--could make officers of all these men?" [...] (cries of [...] "No--no!" [...] and laughter)--"could say, 'I accept this recruit, though he is too short for our standard, because he is poor, and has a mother at home who wants bread?' could enroll this other, who is too weak to bear arms, because he says, 'Look, sir, I shall be stronger anon.' The leader of such an army as ours must select his men, not because they are good and virtuous, but because they are strong and capable. To these our ranks are ever open, and in addition to the warriors who surround me"--(the generals look proudly conscious)--"I tell you, citizens, that I am in treaty with other and most tremendous champions, who will march by the side of our veterans to the achievement of fresh victories. Now, blow, trumpets! Bang, ye gongs! and drummers, drub the thundering skins! Generals and chiefs, we go to sacrifice to the gods." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{was up at}} dawn, {{the next}} morning. In India the tourist's servant does not sleep in {{a room in the}} hotel, but rolls himself up head and ears in his blanket and {{stretches}} himself on the veranda, across the front of his master's door, and spends the night there. I don't believe anybody's servant occupies a room. Apparently, the bungalow servants sleep on the veranda; it is roomy, and goes all around the house. I speak of menservants; I saw none of the other sex. I think there are none, except child-nurses. I was up at dawn, and walked around the veranda, past the rows of sleepers. In front of one door a Hindoo servant was squatting, waiting for his master to call him. He had polished the yellow shoes and placed them by the door, and now {{he had nothing to do}} but wait. It was freezing cold, but there he was, as motionless as a sculptured image, and as patient. It troubled me. I wanted to say to him, [...] "Don't crouch <b>there</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> and freeze; nobody requires it of you; stir around and get warm." [...] But I hadn't the words. I thought of saying 'jeldy jow', but I couldn't remember what it meant, so I didn't say it. I knew another phrase, but it wouldn't come to my mind. I moved on, purposing to dismiss him from my thoughts, but his bare legs and bare feet kept him there. They kept drawing me back from the sunny side to a point whence I could see him. At the end of an hour he had not changed his attitude in the least degree. It was a curious and impressive exhibition of meekness and patience, or fortitude or indifference, I did not know which. But it worried me, and it was spoiling my morning. In fact, it spoiled two hours of it quite thoroughly. I quitted this vicinity, then, and left him to punish himself as much as he might want to. But up to that time the man had not changed his attitude a hair. He will always remain with me, I suppose; his figure never grows vague in my memory. Whenever I read of Indian resignation, Indian patience under wrongs, hardships, and misfortunes, he comes before me. He becomes a personification, and stands for India in trouble. And for untold ages India in trouble has been pursued with the very remark which I was going to utter but didn't, because its meaning had slipped me: [...] "Jeldy jow!" [...] ("Come, shove along!") ...|$|E

5000|$|Britney Spears, {{about to}} go {{out in front of her}} largest ever concert {{audience}} in Rio de Janeiro in 2001, allegedly complained about the organization of her entourage, saying, [...] "Don't tell me that they're just letting the audience just fucking stand out <b>there</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Oh my God!
