30|$|It is {{recognized}} {{that there are}} three typical phenomena of steam breakthrough (Zhang et al. 2002; Cao et al. 2012). The first one is real steam breakthrough. Due to a long time of steam flooding, the injected steam will rapidly advance into production wells through existing high permeability channels and steam even {{can be seen from the}} wellbore. The second phenomenon is hot water breakthrough. When steam moves forward to the producers, heat loss will occur and steam will condense into hot water. Then along with the high permeability channel being formed, the hot water will break through into the producers. Sometimes, flash phenomenon can be seen at the wellbore of the producers. The third phenomenon is pressure transmission. When steam is injected and due to pressure <b>transmission,</b> the <b>liquid</b> production rate of the producers nearby elevates and the drawdown pressure of the producer increases, which will easily lead to steam breakthrough or hot water breakthrough if no measures are conducted.|$|R

A decreasing transmission is observed below 130 nm in both chemically cleaned and distilled liquid argon and assigned to absorption by the analogue of the first argon excimer continuum. For not perfectly cleaned argon a strong influence of impurities on the transmission is observed. Two strong absorption bands at 126. 5 and 141. 0 nm with approximately 2 and 4 nm width, respectively, are assigned to traces of xenon in argon.
