40|$|This study {{proposes that}} when top {{management}} team members {{are convinced that}} <b>their</b> <b>leader</b> is committed to people and productivity, they conclude that <b>their</b> <b>leader</b> is effective and contribute to making their organization innovative. Cooperative goals among top management team members may be credible evidence that <b>their</b> <b>leader</b> has people and production values. Executives from over 100 organizations in China completed measures of their cooperative, competitive, and independent goals, <b>their</b> <b>leader's</b> people and production values, and <b>their</b> <b>leader's</b> effectiveness. CEOs from these firms rated their organization's innovativeness. Structural equation analysis suggested that cooperative goals among top management teams convince them that <b>their</b> <b>leader</b> values people and production and that these values in turn result in leader effectiveness and organizational innovation. Results, coupled with previous research, were interpreted as suggesting that cooperative goals and leader people and production values are foundations for leader and top management team effectiveness in China.

50|$|Proposed by Robert House in 1971, path-goal theory {{predicts that}} {{subordinates}} will {{be satisfied with}} <b>their</b> <b>leader</b> if they feel <b>their</b> <b>leader’s</b> behavior will lead them to satisfaction. Also, subordinates will be motivated when they feel that their satisfaction depends on their performance and <b>their</b> <b>leader</b> acts {{in a way to}} help them reach goals (Den Hartog & Koopman, 2001, House, 1971). Path-goal theory predicts that when goals and the paths to those goals are clear, subordinates may not need leader guidance (Kerr & Jermier, 1978).|$|R
5|$|In {{the same}} time Zelanti, also began to incline to give their support to Ganganelli, looking upon him as {{indifferent}} or even favourable to the Jesuits. It seems that the attitude of Zelanti was decided by the secret negotiations between <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> Alessandro and Gian Francesco Albani and the Spanish cardinals. Cardinal de Bernis, the nominal leader of the court faction, probably did not play any role in the appointment of Ganganelli and only followed the instructions of Marquis d'Aubeterre when all had been already known.|$|E
5|$|On September 26, Anderson {{and his men}} reached Monroe County, Missouri, and {{traveled}} towards Paris, but learned of other nearby guerrillas and rendezvoused with them near Audrain County. Anderson and his men camped with at least 300 men, including Todd. Although {{a large group of}} guerrillas was assembled, <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> felt that there were no promising targets to attack, because all of the large towns nearby were heavily guarded.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, {{the guerrillas}} assassinated the French-installed chief of Gò Công, {{displaying}} his severed {{head in the}} town market. The chief's servant, who was an informant for Định, aided this operation. The killing {{had the effect of}} intimidating the chief's designated successor into submitting to the rebels and ceasing his service for the French. In November 1861, Định's men went into the town of Mỹ Tho to recruit militants and collect food supplies. During this time, they attacked and burned pro-French villages and <b>their</b> <b>leaders.</b>|$|E

5|$|The next {{rebellion}} against royal power in Transylvania {{broke out in}} 1467. Irritated by a new tax that King Matthias Corvinus had just introduced, representatives of the Three Nations concluded an alliance against the monarch and declared the three incumbent voivodes (the brothers Counts John and Sigismund Szentgyörgyi and Berthold Ellerbach) <b>their</b> <b>leaders.</b> The king put down the revolt in a week, but did not sentence the three voivodes, because their {{active role in the}} revolt was never proven.|$|E

On their journey, some of the Teleri feared the Misty Mountains and dared not cross them. They turned back and stayed in the vales of the Anduin, and became the Nandor; these were led by Lenwë.|$|E
5|$|The secret {{protocol}} {{contained in}} the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union had relegated Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania to the Soviet sphere of influence. During the course of late 1939 and early 1940, the Soviet Union issued a series of ultimatums to the Baltic governments that {{eventually led to the}} illegal annexation of the states. (At about the same time, the Soviet Union was exerting similar pressure on Finland.) About 30,000 Soviet troops entered the Baltic states during June 1940, followed by arrests of <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> and citizens.|$|E

5|$|To begin with, {{the number}} of the party members is {{extremely}} large. Millions of people believed in the National Socialist philosophy; they were influenced by the broadcasts of the Führer and the detailed party propaganda. Individual thinking was switched off, and the party members allowed <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> to set the guidelines in everything for them--and this spread throughout the entire population. In this way, more fanatics were created who were ready to use brute force, and other means of terror, to eliminate any internal resistance.|$|E

Guangwu made Luoyang his capital in 25 AD, and by 27 AD his {{officers}} Deng Yu and Feng Yi had forced the Red Eyebrows to surrender and executed <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> for treason. From 26 until 36 AD, Emperor Guangwu had {{to wage war}} against other regional warlords who claimed the title of emperor; when these warlords were defeated, China reunified under the Han.|$|E
5|$|Willson's {{interventions}} ultimately {{had little}} to do with the end of the violence. In 1908, the courts began handing down convictions against the Night Riders, though many of <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> escaped the convictions. A 1909 measure sponsored by Kentucky representative Augustus O. Stanley removed a national tax on tobacco, and in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found the American Tobacco Company to be in violation of antitrust laws. Each of these events helped raise tobacco prices, pacifying the violent farmers.|$|E

5|$|Between 9 and 10 pm on {{the night}} of April 18, 1775, Joseph Warren told Revere and William Dawes that the British troops were about to embark in boats from Boston bound for Cambridge and the road to Lexington and Concord. Warren's {{intelligence}} suggested that the most likely objectives of the regulars' movements later that night would be the capture of Adams and Hancock. They did not worry about the possibility of regulars marching to Concord, since the supplies at Concord were safe, but they did think <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> in Lexington were unaware of the potential danger that night. Revere and Dawes were sent out to warn them and to alert colonial militias in nearby towns.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the period of the wars of {{independence}} itself was marked by a rapid expansion of representative government, for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was marked by militarism {{because of the lack of}} well-defined political and national institutions. The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to ensure that they got their rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the caudillos, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.|$|E
5|$|Despite these incidents, {{legislative}} elections planned {{before the}} coup {{were held in}} April 1964. They were originally to be held on 23 February, though he dissolved the National Assembly and rescheduled them for 12 April. Upon insistence of the French, M'ba allowed opposition candidates to run, which it claimed was {{the main reason for}} starting the coup in the first place. However, <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> were barred from participating because of their involvement in the coup, and known anti-Mba organizers were deported to remote parts of the country. In addition, M'ba was known to have bribed voters with banknotes.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{felt that}} Hindu-Muslim {{co-operation}} {{was necessary for}} political progress against the British. He leveraged the Khilafat movement, wherein Sunni Muslims in India, <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> such as the sultans of princely states in India and Ali brothers championed the Turkish Caliph as a solidarity symbol of Sunni Islamic community (ummah). They saw the Caliph as their means to support Islam and the Islamic law after the defeat of Ottoman Empire in World War I. Gandhi's support to the Khilafat movement led to mixed results. It initially led to a strong Muslim support for Gandhi. However, the Hindu leaders including Rabindranath Tagore questioned Gandhi's leadership because they were largely against recognising or supporting the Sunni Islamic Caliph in Turkey.|$|E
5|$|Having {{achieved}} {{full control}} over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his allies began to suppress the remaining opposition. The Social Democratic Party was banned and its assets seized. While many trade union delegates were in Berlin for May Day activities, SA stormtroopers demolished union offices around the country. On 2 May 1933 all trade unions were forced to dissolve and <b>their</b> <b>leaders</b> were arrested. Some were sent to concentration camps. The German Labour Front was formed as an umbrella organisation to represent all workers, administrators, and company owners, thus reflecting the concept of national socialism {{in the spirit of}} Hitler's Volksgemeinschaft ("people's community").|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 July around 900 people formed outside the Bastille, {{primarily}} working-class members of the nearby faubourg Saint-Antoine, but also including some mutinous soldiers and local traders.

Just after midday, another negotiator was let in to discuss the situation, but no compromise could be reached: the revolutionary representatives now wanted both the guns and the gunpowder in the Bastille to be handed over, but de Launay refused to do so unless he received authorisation from his leadership in Versailles. By this point {{it was clear that the}} governor lacked the experience or the skills to defuse the situation.|$|E
