The principles that guide Zwingli's interpretations are derived from his rationalist humanist education and his Reformed understanding of the Bible. He rejected literalist interpretations of a passage, such as those of the Anabaptists, and used synecdoche [...] and analogies, methods he describes in A Friendly Exegesis (1527). Two analogies that he used quite effectively were between baptism and circumcision and between the eucharist and Passover.

500|$|Further {{evidence}} {{has been found in}} the quotation based on Luke 22:15 (22.4), where the saying has been modified by insertion of the word [...] "flesh" [...] to provide a rationale for vegetarianism. [...] <b>The</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>context</b> of the quotation suggests that it may be closely related to a Clementine source, the Journeys of Peter. Reading from the same source, Epiphanius states that the Ebionites abstained from [...] "meat with soul in it" [...] (15.3), and he attributes this teaching to Ebionite interpolations [...] "they corrupt the contents and leave a few genuine items". Due to the close association of this saying with the Clementine literature of the 3rd and 4th century, the earlier practice of vegetarianism by the 2nd-century Ebionites known to Irenaeus has been questioned. The strict vegetarianism of the Ebionites known to Epiphanius may have been a reaction to the cessation of Jewish sacrifices and a safeguard against the consumption of unclean meat in a pagan environment.|$|E

The aim of this study is to investigate the different motivational variables in <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> learning <b>context</b> among <b>the</b> non-Muslim Malaysian learners of Arabic (NMMLAs). The focus variables of <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> learning <b>context</b> in this study are teacher's personality and teacher's method of teaching. The study adopts a mix method approach where a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews were employed to obtain the data. The questionnaires were distributed to 207 respondents who are non-Muslim Malaysians learning Arabic as a compulsory subject at the Faculty of Law in UKM. In order to gain more insights, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 respondents. The findings reveal that teacher's personality seems to play the most important role in shaping the culture of learning Arabic as a foreign language. The teacher's style and method of teaching is another important component in language instruction that motivated the Arabic language learners in their classroom...|$|R

40|$|In the {{standard}} version of conceptual metaphor theory, metaphors are stable connected {{structures in the}} conceptual sys-tem that emerge either because there is some similarity between two domains of experience (resemblance-based metaphors) or because the two domains are correlated in bodily experience (correlation-based metaphors). I propose {{that in addition to}} these two types of metaphor there is a third one, I call them “context-induced ” metaphors. These metaphors emerge from <b>the</b> (<b>immediate</b> and less <b>immediate)</b> <b>context</b> in which conceptu-alizers conceive of ideas in metaphorical ways. I suggest that the context can have a priming effect on (metaphorical) conceptualization. The effect of various kinds of context on metaphorical conceptualization can take a variety of forms, and several of them produce imagistic metaphors. The kinds of contexts that can produce context-induced metaphors include the following: (1) <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> physical setting, (2) {{what we know about the}} major entities participating in the dis-course, (3) <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> cultural <b>context,</b> (4) <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> social setting, and (5) <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> linguistic <b>context</b> itself. Of these, the context that most clearly produces visual metaphors is <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> physical setting. Various aspects of the physical setting can prompt conceptualizers to select var-ious (visual, auditory, etc.) images from the context as source domains for their metaphorical targets. This process can be ei-ther conscious or unconscious. In the paper, I discuss several examples of imagistic metaphors of the visual kind...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The Normalization Process Model is a {{conceptual}} tool intended {{to assist in}} understanding the factors that affect implementation processes in clinical trials and other evaluations of complex interventions. It focuses on the ways that the implementation of complex interventions is shaped by problems of workability and integration. Method In this paper the model is applied to two different complex trials: (i) the delivery of problem solving therapies for psychosocial distress, and (ii) the delivery of nurse-led clinics for heart failure treatment in primary care. Results Application of the model shows how process evaluations {{need to focus on}} more than <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>contexts</b> in which trial outcomes are generated. Problems relating to intervention workability and integration also need to be understood. The model may be used effectively to explain the implementation process in trials of complex interventions. Conclusion The model invites evaluators to attend equally to considering how a complex intervention interacts with existing patterns of service organization, professional practice, and professional-patient interaction. The justification for this may be found in the abundance of reports of clinical effectiveness for interventions that have little hope of being implemented in real healthcare settings. </p...|$|R
