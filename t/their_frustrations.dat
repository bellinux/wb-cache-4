Those who participated, among the best-educated in the Middle East, took to brandishing their banned national flag and throwing rocks and molotov-bombs at IDF forces, to express <b>their</b> <b>frustrations</b> at limited opportunities after decades of growing up under Israeli occupation. It has been called 'the first stone-throwing rebellion against Israel.' Shame and guilt for not doing enough to help their parents or free their land also played a motivational role.|$|E

The PATC drew on former members of Dunham's touring company as well as local residents for its teaching staff. While trying to help the young people in the community she was even jailed herself, making international headlines which quickly embarrassed local police officials to release her. She also continued refining and teaching the Dunham Technique to transmit that knowledge to succeeding generations of dance students, and lecturing at annual Masters' Seminars in St. Louis that attracted dance students from around the world every summer until her death.

500|$|Ships would {{generally}} seek repairs in Honolulu, but captains preferred anchoring off Lahaina {{because of}} its easy access from the Lahaina Roads and for the fresh provisions available in town. [...] According to Henry L. Sheldon, [...] "the business of the entire population was the furnishing of supplies to whalers and entertaining the crews". Sailors who had been hunting whales {{for months at a}} time went to Lahaina to drink grog and meet women. Historian Noelani M. Arista notes that by 1825; a kapu prohibiting women from going out to ships for the purpose of prostitution was proclaimed by the ali'i (Hawaiian chiefs), altering that familiar traffic of the burgeoning Pacific seaport towns. Enraged that they could not cajole, coax, or coerce Hawaiian women into violating the kapu, the sailors turned <b>their</b> <b>frustrations</b> on the American missionaries, whom they blamed for the emergence of this new unreasonably strict moral law.|$|E

They argue that [...] "the language Ludy uses to describe her time of waiting and trusting implies a difficult and long struggle that is finally rewarded by God" [...] and suggests that a long wait results in an even greater reward, a concept that Colón and Field, despite acknowledging as commonplace, disagree with and trace back to William Shakespeare's Cymbeline, which states [...] "the more delay'd, delighted." [...] Singled Out suggests that, because Leslie was only 16 when she met Eric, her story is unlikely to inspire hope in older singles.|$|E

500|$|Disenchanted {{with the}} {{unfulfilled}} {{promise of the}} NSDAP to eliminate Jews from German society, SA members were eager to lash out against the Jewish minority {{as a way of}} expressing <b>their</b> <b>frustrations.</b> A Gestapo report from early 1935 stated that the rank and file of the NSDAP would set in motion a solution to the [...] "Jewish problem... from below that the government would then have to follow". Assaults, vandalism, and boycotts against Jews, which the Nazi government had temporarily curbed in 1934, increased again in 1935 amidst a propaganda campaign authorised {{at the highest levels of}} government. Most non-party members ignored the boycotts and objected to the violence out of concern for their own safety. The Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka argues that there was a disparity between the views of the Alte Kämpfer (longtime party members) and the general public, but that even those Germans who were not politically active favoured bringing in tougher new antisemitic laws in 1935. The matter was raised to the forefront of the state agenda as a result of this antisemitic agitation.|$|E

Meg also informs Lois that when she turns eighteen, she is considering never seeing her again. Lois is reduced to tears and profusely apologizes to Meg. Meg then confronts Peter who, unable to comprehend her insults, thinks that his daughter's argument is amusing until she calls him a [...] "waste of a man."
