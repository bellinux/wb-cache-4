5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, have control over <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>health</b> and well-being. They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous {{and encourage them to}} refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E

25|$|Reflecting on {{his career}} in {{medicine}} years later, Crichton concluded that patients too often shunned responsibility for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>health,</b> relying on doctors as miracle workers rather than advisors.

25|$|Self-efficacy is a person's {{belief that}} he or she can {{accomplish}} a particular activity. It is a related concept introduced by Albert Bandura, and has been measured by means of a psychometric scale. It differs from locus of control by relating to competence in circumscribed situations and activities (rather than more general cross-situational beliefs about control). Bandura has also emphasised differences between self-efficacy and self-esteem, using examples where low self-efficacy (for instance, in ballroom dancing) are unlikely to result in low self-esteem because competence in that domain is not very important to an individual. Although individuals may have a high internal health locus of control and feel in control of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>health,</b> they may not feel efficacious in performing a specific treatment regimen that is essential to maintaining <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>health.</b> Self-efficacy {{plays an important role in}} one's health because when people feel that they have self-efficacy over their health conditions, the effects of their health becomes less of a stressor.|$|E

25|$|Several obituaries {{describe}} Liberati's professional experience, {{highlighting the}} main features of his work and the ideas he supported. He believed that within a health system, research should {{be an integral part}} of its mission, especially where lack of commercial interests prevents the possibility of private investment, and that researchers should concentrate on what is relevant to patients, not to their careers or to drug companies. Moreover, he strongly believed that developing alliances with consumers is necessary for setting research priorities, and that research results should be easily accessible to people who need to make decisions about <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>health.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{countries}} require child and/or adult cyclists to wear helmets, as {{this may}} protect riders from head trauma. Countries which require adult cyclists to wear helmets include Spain, New Zealand and Australia. Mandatory helmet wearing {{is one of}} the most controversial topics in the cycling world, with proponents arguing that it reduces head injuries and thus is an acceptable requirement, while opponents argue that by making cycling seem more dangerous and cumbersome, it reduces cyclist numbers on the streets, creating an overall negative health effect (fewer people cycling for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>health,</b> and the remaining cyclists being more exposed through a reversed safety in numbers effect).|$|E

25|$|Many mass {{deworming}} {{programs also}} combine their efforts {{with a public}} health education. These health education programs often stress important preventative techniques such as: washing your hands before eating, and staying away from water/areas contaminated by human feces. These programs may also stress that shoes must be worn, however, these come with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>health</b> risks {{and may not be}} effective. Shoe wearing patterns in towns and villages across the globe are determined by cultural beliefs, and the levels of education within that society. The wearing of shoes will prevent the entry of hookworm infections from the surrounding soils into tender skin regions; such as areas between the toes.|$|E
25|$|Seniors’ {{subjective}} health remains {{relatively stable}} while objective health worsens with age. Furthermore, {{it seems that}} the perceived health improves with age when objective health is controlled in the equation. This phenomenon is known as the paradox of ageing. People's expectations concerning health co-evolve with the health norms surrounding one's age. Elderly people often associate their functional and physical decline with the normal ageing process. The elderly may actually enhance their perception of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>health</b> through social comparison; for instance, the older people get, the more they may consider themselves in better health than their same-aged peers. Hence, the older a person becomes and the more their actual health declines, the greater the potential role is for social comparison processes to create a gap between a person's objective and subjective health.|$|E
25|$|One {{historical}} {{problem with}} the U.S. system was known as job lock, in which people become tied to their jobs for fear of losing their health insurance. This reduces {{the flexibility of the}} labor market. Federal legislation passed since the mid-1980s, particularly COBRA and HIPAA, has been aimed at reducing job lock. However, providers of group health insurance in many states are permitted to use experience rating and it remains legal in the United States for prospective employers to investigate a job candidate's health and past health claims as part of a hiring decision. Someone who has recently been diagnosed with cancer, for example, may face job lock not out of fear of losing their health insurance, but based on prospective employers not wanting to add the cost of treating that illness to <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>health</b> insurance pool, for fear of future insurance rate increases. Thus, being diagnosed with an illness can cause someone to be forced to stay in their current job.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that adult human females are consistently lighter in skin pigmentation than males in the same population. This form of sexual dimorphism {{is due to the}} requirement in human females for high amounts of calcium during pregnancy and lactation. Breastfeeding newborns, whose skeletons are growing, require high amounts of calcium intake from the mother's milk (about 4 times more than during prenatal development), part of which comes from reserves in the mother's skeleton. Adequate vitamin D resources are needed to absorb calcium from the diet, and {{it has been shown that}} deficiencies of vitamin D and calcium increase the likelihood of various birth defects such as spina bifida and rickets. Natural selection has led to females with lighter skin than males in all indigenous populations because women must get enough vitamin D and calcium to support the development of fetus and nursing infant and to maintain <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>health.</b>|$|E

500|$|Like {{many white}} Americans in the U.S. in the 1930s, some {{leaders of the}} birth control {{movement}} believed that lighter-skinned races were superior to darker-skinned races.See also The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger, Volume 1, p. 45. They assumed that African Americans were intellectually backward, would be relatively incompetent in managing <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>health,</b> and would require special supervision from whites. The dominance of whites in the movement's leadership and medical staff resulted in accusations of racism from blacks and suspicions that [...] "race suicide" [...] would be a consequence of large scale adoption of birth control.McCann (1994), pp. 151–154 ("race suicide").

40|$|Employment-contingent health {{insurance}} may create incentives for ill workers to remain employed at a sufficient level (usually full-time) to maintain access to {{health insurance}} coverage. We study employed married women, comparing the labor supply responses to new breast cancer diagnoses of women dependent on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> employment for <b>health</b> insurance with the responses {{of women who are}} less dependent on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> employment for <b>health</b> insurance, because of actual or potential {{access to health}} insurance through their spouse's employer. We find evidence that women who depend on <b>their</b> <b>own</b> job for <b>health</b> insurance reduce their labor supply by less after a diagnosis of breast cancer. In the estimates that best control for unobservables associated with health insurance status, the hours reduction for women who continue to work is 8 to 11 % smaller.
