5|$|In 2004, the ACLU {{sued the}} federal {{government}} in American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft on behalf of Nicholas Merrill, owner of an Internet service provider. Under the provisions of <b>the</b> <b>Patriot</b> <b>Act,</b> the government had issued national security letters to Merrill to compel him to provide private Internet access information from some of his customers. In addition, the government placed a gag order on Merrill, forbidding him from discussing the matter with anyone.|$|E

5|$|As Speaker, Hastert shepherded <b>the</b> USA <b>Patriot</b> <b>Act</b> in October 2001 to {{passage in}} the House on a 357-66 vote. In a 2011 interview, Hastert claimed credit for its passage over the misgivings of many members.

In contrast, a majority of both CPC members and of Democratic members of Congress voted for the amendment, while Kennedy stood out as a supporter of the party leadership. His vote has been criticized as a sign for a lack of commitment to civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{has been}} criticized by liberals, such as when it {{excluded}} Communists from its leadership ranks, when it defended Neo-Nazis, when it declined to defend Paul Robeson, or when it opposed {{the passage of the}} National Labor Relations Act. Conversely, it {{has been criticized}} by conservatives, such as when it argued against official prayer in public schools, or when it opposed <b>the</b> <b>Patriot</b> <b>Act.</b> The ACLU has supported conservative figures such as Rush Limbaugh, George Wallace, Henry Ford, and Oliver North; and it has supported liberal figures such as Dick Gregory, Rockwell Kent, and Dr. Benjamin Spock.|$|E
5|$|Biden is {{considered}} to be a moderate liberal, clocking a 77.5 percent liberal voting record in 2006 and lifetime score of 76.8 percent. Biden is Pro-Choice on abortion rated 100% by NARAL and supports a state's right to have civil unions. He favors a Balanced Budget Amendment and a rollback of the Bush tax cuts. He supports <b>the</b> <b>PATRIOT</b> <b>Act,</b> the war in Afghanistan and voted in favor of authorization of military force into Iraq. He believes a political solution can be met in Iraq through federalization. Biden would favor American military intervention into Sudan to end the Darfur genocide. He supports Gun control and was given an F by the NRA. He opposes the No Child Left Behind Act although he voted in favor of it in 2002. Biden opposes capital punishment and supports the continuation of the war on drugs.

2500|$|The {{history of}} <b>the</b> USA <b>PATRIOT</b> <b>Act</b> {{involved}} many parties who opposed {{and supported the}} legislation, which was proposed, enacted and signed into law 45 days after the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001. <b>The</b> USA <b>PATRIOT</b> <b>Act,</b> though approved by large majorities in the U.S. Senate and House of Representative, was controversial, {{and parts of the}} law were invalidated or [...] modified by successful legal challenges over constitutional infringements to civil liberties. [...] The Act had several sunset provisions, most reauthorized by <b>the</b> USA <b>PATRIOT</b> Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and <b>the</b> USA <b>PATRIOT</b> <b>Act</b> Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act. [...] Both reauthorizations incorporated amendments to <b>the</b> original USA <b>PATRIOT</b> <b>Act,</b> and other federal laws.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} <b>the</b> USA <b>PATRIOT</b> <b>Act</b> is {{its effect on}} the privacy of Canadians living in the province of British Columbia (B.C.). British Columbia's privacy commissioner raises concerns that <b>the</b> USA <b>PATRIOT</b> <b>Act</b> will allow <b>the</b> United States government to access Canadians' private information, such as personal medical records, that are outsourced to American companies. Although the government of B.C. has taken measures to prevent United States authorities from obtaining information, the widespread powers of <b>the</b> USA <b>PATRIOT</b> <b>Act</b> could overcome legislation that is passed in Canada. [...] B.C. Privacy Commissioner David Loukidelis stated in a report on the consequences of <b>the</b> USA <b>PATRIOT</b> <b>Act,</b> “once information is sent across borders, it's difficult, if not impossible, to control”.|$|R
5|$|In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security {{was created}} by the Homeland Security Act to {{coordinate}} domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The USA Patriot Act gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned sky marshals to flights. Further, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for airport security. The law created the Transportation Security Administration to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy. After suspected abuses of the USA Patriot Act were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced <b>the</b> <b>Patriot</b> <b>Act</b> in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds.|$|E
5|$|In these {{conflict}} of laws cases, Apple met with conflicting international judicial opinions: an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court decision on the copyrightability of object code. In IBM v. Computer Imports, the High Court of New Zealand then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that, although object code is not an original literary work in its own right, it is a reproduction of source code in material form and therefore an infringement of copyright takes place if it is copied without the authorization of the copyright owner. Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple, but all other software companies as well, and the conflicts remained unresolved until {{the creation of an}} international legal regime embodied in further changes to national copyright laws, which ultimately made object code subject to copyright law. These revisions of law in favor of making object code subject to copyright law are still controversial. The revisions also form the technical underpinnings (via the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act) for the legal notions of electronic privacy violation and computer trespass, as well as the further development of anti-hacking law-making such as <b>the</b> <b>Patriot</b> <b>Act</b> and the Convention on Cybercrime.|$|E

In response to a requirement of <b>the</b> USA <b>PATRIOT</b> <b>Act,</b> <b>the</b> ACLU withdrew from the Combined Federal Campaign charity drive. The campaign imposed a requirement that ACLU employees must be checked against a federal anti-terrorism watch list.
