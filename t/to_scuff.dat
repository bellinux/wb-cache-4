40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} {{problems}} with the operation of spiral bevel gears is related to very severe conditions in the contact of the meshing teeth; therefore, lubrication is very difficult, which {{increases the risk of}} scuffing occurrence. One of the ways <b>to</b> achieve better <b>scuffing</b> resistance is by the deposition of a low-friction coating on the bevel gears teeth. Gear scuffing tests were performed using a bevel gear test rig designed and manufactured at ITeE-PIB. The authorial bevel gear scuffing test was performed. Specially designed, spiral bevel gears were used for testing. Two material combinations were tested: uncoated pinion- coated wheel and, for reference, both gears without coatings. The a-C:H:W (trade name WC/C) coating of DLC type was deposited on the wheel teeth. A mineral, automotive gear oil of API GL- 5 performance level was used for lubrication. It is shown that the resistance <b>to</b> <b>scuffing</b> may be significantly improved when the a-C:H:W coating is deposited on the spiral bevel gear teeth...|$|R

5000|$|Mary Jane Lavina Girard Robidoux, {{the widow}} of Albert Robidoux, a {{successful}} wheat farmer and rancher from Kansas, commissioned {{the construction of the}} house at 1615 Galena Street in 1913. Mrs. Robidoux moved to Aurora, Colorado, following her husband’s untimely death in 1912. Mrs. Robidoux had adequate financial resources and invested in the design and construction of one of the finest Craftsman-style brick bungalows in Aurora. It is no surprise Mrs. Robidoux wanted her new home to be located on Aurora’s most affluent street: “Silk Stocking Row” as it was referred. According to the Aurora Democrat dated October 3, 1913, the Robidoux House was “finest house yet erected in Aurora.”There have only been four families including Mrs. Robidoux, who have resided at 1615 Galena Street and much still remains of the original house. Mrs. Robidoux died in her home in June1 929. She left the house to St. Clara’s Orphanage as a memorial to her late husband Albert. The rest of her estate was split up between nieces, nephews, and surviving siblings. St. Clara’s Orphanage sold the house to the Cornelius Muldoon family in 1930. The Muldoons lovingly cared for the woodwork for over 60 years (from 1930 to 1996). It was said that the matriarch of the family, Clare Muldoon, never allowed anything other than cheesecloth to be used for dusting. In the 1940s, this house had the highest assessed value of any residence in Aurora. St. Clara’s Orphanage sold the house to the Cornelius Muldoon family in 1930. Mr. Muldoon became sick in World War I from mustard gas and sought medical help as a disabled veteran from the Fitzsimons Army Hospital in Aurora. The Muldoons had two young sons who still live in the neighborhood today, Neil and Felix. They tell stories about how their mother was so grateful to have the lovely home that she took great care of it and would not allow them <b>to</b> <b>scuff</b> any of the woodwork. During the Depression, their mother served bread and soup out of the back porch to men passing through from the railway station looking for work. Mrs. Muldoon died in 1984, after which a family member moved in and lived in the house until 1996. The family sold it to non-family members at this time. In 2007, the current owners bought the house and completed some minor restoration of the wood floors and staircase damaged over the years.

40|$|Studies <b>to</b> better {{understand}} <b>scuffing</b> began approximately sixty years ago, {{when it was}} postulated that scuffing occurs when a critical temperature of the surface is reached, at which desorption of surface films occurs. An extension to this hypothesis was proposed suggesting interaction of chemically active species with the metal surfaces, notably oxygen and thus scuffing {{would be associated with}} the rate of oxide formation and destruction. In the 1950 ???s another major development in the field of tribology was started which recognized and understood elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) became the focus of study and it was assumed that a system is in danger of scuffing when the thickness of the fluid film between the surfaces. Recent fundamental <b>scuffing</b> studies related <b>to</b> air conditioning compressors under dry sliding conditions were performed by Sheiretov, who proposed a process leading to subsurface failure, which eventually led <b>to</b> <b>scuffing.</b> Further studies carried by Yoon focusing on scuffing under starved lubrication conditions (typical conditions for air conditioning compressors), suggested that <b>scuffing</b> was related <b>to</b> shear failure of the bulk material which was caused by formation of macroscopic adhesions at the sliding interface. In these recent studies the effect of surface topography on scuffing has not been treated thoroughly. Further more their approach was based on macro -tribological experiments and meso-to-micro analysis methods. This was intentional since the surface roughness of typical engineering surfaces is large with Ra values from 0. 1 to 1 mm, thus the previous researchers were seeking average effects in their studies. Also earlier studies did not examine the progression leading <b>to</b> <b>scuffing.</b> In the present study we investigate, first; the progression of surface topography and respective change in surface parameters with tribological testing leading to scuffing; second, changes in chemical composition of the surface and near surface layers of the sample at the micro and nano-meter scales, and investigate its relation <b>to</b> <b>scuffing,</b> this study differs from the ones carried out by its predecessors (Sheiretov, Yoon) in that it tracks topographical and chemical changes of the interface surface of the (softer) aluminum disc as it progresses form its virgin state <b>to</b> its <b>scuffed</b> state. Furthermore the analyses are carried out using macro to nanometer scales and techniques. To our knowledge this is the first such comprehensive study that will investigate the use of techniques that are typically used in semi -conductors and MEMS applications, whose surfaces are by several orders smoother than the engineering surfaces that will be used in this study. A shoe-on-disc geometry, which is used to carry out the experiments consists of a steel shoe on aluminum disc and in an approximate simulation of a swash-plate/shoe contact in an automotive swash [...] plate compressor. The High Pressure Tribometer (HPT) is used to simulate the progression of wear conditions. The refrigerant used in this case is R 410 A with a POE lubricant. Once the experimental samples have been tested on the HPT, two sets of analytical tests are run, the first to measure the surface roughness and extract the statistical parameters, and the second to analyze chemical composition of the surfaces and the nano-meter range sub-surfaces. Based on the study it is suggested that the use of the micro to nano meter range scales in analyzing engineering surfaces is appropriate and correlates well to the macro to meso scale wear results. Thus the goal of this thesis Is to investigate the evolution of both the topographical and chemical characteristics as the surface of an aluminum alloy is worn out in a swash plate compressor using macro to nano-scales.

40|$|Exterior {{aerospace}} topcoats {{are typically}} highly cross-linked polyurethane based paints {{designed to be}} resistant to UV degradation {{with a high level}} of adhesion required during all aspects of flight. These topcoats are also designed to be resistant and inert to a variety of aggressive solvents and airplane fluids. Consequently, during processing, a topcoat surface can be inert to the reception of the next topcoat layer. Proper surface preparation of each paint layer prior to the application of the next is critical for ensuring adequate adhesion. Historically, the only viable method to prevent de-bonding of cured paints has been to mechanically abrade (sand) prior to the application of subsequent coating layers. However, sanding is an economically hazardous process, adds process flow time, and produces contamination. In addition, sanding intricate stencil lettering in most cases is not feasible without tearing the stencil material and/or leaving visible scratches in the areas immediately surrounding the stencil markings.

40|$|When Samuel Beckett’s {{library was}} {{opened up to}} scholars, it gave {{some sense of the}} {{extraordinary}} amount of material that had been funnelled into the development of a writer so famed for his minimalism. Alongside an extensive array of books that spoke to his literary interests, there were texts suggestive of medical and scientific concerns, a number of dictionaries and the eleventh edition of Encyclopaedia Britannica. Some sections of the encyclopaedia were clearly marked by Beckett, and there is a folded page that suggests an entry over which he may have lingered: “Brain”. Beckett did dog-ear pages in books that interested him though {{there is no way of}} knowing definitively if he was the one who pressed down this page; still, Dirk Van Hulle and Mark Nixon note, somewhat conservatively, that “Brain” “could conceivably have interested Beckett” (2013, 193). Indeed, as this issue of the Journal of Medical Humanities demonstrates, the brain and its functioning was of abiding, particular interest to Beckett. Scholars now know that Beckett took extensive notes (held in Trinity College Dublin) on contemporary psychology and psychoanalysis in the 1930 s; he also read medical text books and the neurological conditions they detailed with more attention than one would expect from a casually interested amateur. But then, there was nothing casual about Beckett’s anatomising of the mind and body in his work. From the 1930 s, when he began to write creatively in a sustained fashion, until the final parched utterances of the 1980 s, the tensely discordant relationship between mind and body and the functioning of the brain – the site where mind and body are most insistently implicated – remain key thematic interests for Beckett and produce an extraordinary push and pull on the form of his texts. It is certainly hard to think of a non-medically-trained writer who has returned more insistently to the phenomenological experience of disorder and the technical language of neurological and psychological dysfunction. Equally, it is hard to think of another writer who has a stronger sense of the potential of disorder and dysfunction <b>to</b> <b>scuff</b> up the window of internal representation that, in health, can render our experience so smoothly continuous, so transparent, that one only looks through it rather than at it. Like scratches on a pane of glass, Beckett’s articulations of disorder and disease work to denude experience of its occulting clarity, as they render grittily explicit the uncomfortable disjunctions between idea and expression, mind and body, free will and automaticity, continuity and rupture, endurance and senescence that are as much a part of human experience as the evenness of wellbeing. ...|$|E

Scuffing, described as sudden catastrophic failure of lubricated sliding surfaces, usually characterized by a sudden rapid increase in friction, temperature and noise, is an important failure mode on sliding surfaces. In this study, the frictional forces, wear amounts and cycles <b>to</b> <b>scuffing</b> in boundary lubricated sliding condition were measured using the reciprocating wear tester. The cylinder blocks with several values of surface roughness were used as reciprocating specimens, {{and a piece of}} piston ring was used as fixed pin. As increasing load by several steps in lubricated sliding, the friction signals indicated the state of surface interactions, such as friction forces, changes of lubricating films and scuffing. There were some rapid increases in friction forces just before the scuffing would occur. It was found that there was the optimum value of initial surface roughness to prolong the wear life of sliding surfaces. As decreasing the surface roughness of cylinder blocks, the wear amounts were decreased due to increasing the contact area.

40|$|Scuffing {{that occurs}} at {{tribological}} contacts in mechanical components, brings about topographical, chemical, and mechanical changes mainly at the sub-micron surface. In this project, extensive studies involving {{the use of}} various engineering and scientific tools were performed {{to better understand the}} exact mechanisms behind this phenomenon. A High Pressure Tribometer (HPT) was used to simulate shoe-on-disk tribological contacts under various conditions as encountered in compressor surfaces. Specifically, Al 390 -T 6 disk/ 52100 steel pin tribo-pairs are representative of typical contacting surfaces used in swash plate-type air-conditioning compressors. Once the time <b>to</b> <b>scuff</b> a sample under the test protocol was determined, subsequent HPT tests were stopped at 0. 25 x Scuffing Time, 0. 50 x Scuffing Time, and 0. 75 x Scuffing Time intervals. The progressive change in disk topography leading up to scuffing was first observed in the 1 -D roughness study [1], but more extensively captured by the 2 -D Birmingham- 14 roughness characterization that is also described in this report [2]. When the chemical analyses were conducted on the uppermost surfaces for depths of 120 nm, significant changes in some of the major chemical element concentration were revealed at scuffing. The major chemical compositional changes include a depletion of silicon, which was used to strengthen the aluminum alloy, and a drastic increase of oxygen component, signaling heavy oxidation at scuffing [1]. The mechanical properties of the disks undergoing tribological evolution were also investigated through various experimental hardness measurements, ranging from macro- to micro-, and to nanoscales [3]. Based on the experimental hardness results, {{it was found that the}} hardness of the material becomes higher at the micro- and sub-micro scales than the bulk, regardless of the amount of wear towards scuffing. It was also observed that there was a gradual weakening of the uppermost 60 nm. In this report, we describe in detail the surface roughness changes that occur to the Al 390 -T 6 samples as they undergo progressively longer tribological testing, eventually leading to scuffing.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the {{key role}} of the surface morphology {{in the creation of}} oleophilic or oleophobic behaviour (via oil capacity) of metallic surfaces and its hypothetical influence on the initiation of the catastrophic mechanism of scuffing. Taking into consideration the fact that the commonly used roughness parameters do not correlate with the scuffing performance, the application of the morphological furrows to analysis of the susceptibility of metallic surfaces to this type of surface failure was proposed and elucidated. Furrows characteristic was based on the analysis of their three typical parameters (max. and mean depth and max. density, in the initial and scuffed surface state) in the mechanical and physicochemical aspects of the surface and lubricant relationship. Improved strategy offering the discriminating methodology of scuffing transition was presented and discussed. Obtained results enabled the identification furrows' parameters predisposed <b>to</b> <b>scuffing</b> prediction and therefore worthy to consideration for use in manufacturing of frictional operating metallic parts exposed to catastrophic failures...|$|R

40|$|Generally, {{engineering}} materials {{must have}} some specific characteristics and those characteristics which are important in selecting material for specific applications related with material structure and life-time. It {{is difficult to find}} all these features especially mechanical and surface properties in a single material. So the solution is found by increasing the strength of bulk material, and increasing wear and corrosion resistance of the surface. Therefore, engineering materials are selected from cheaper materials providing needed structural features, and the other surface characteristics are provided from coatings. Friction and wear of the sliding components in an automobile cause an increase in both fuel consumption and emission. Many engine components involved with sliding contact are all susceptible <b>to</b> <b>scuffing</b> failure at some points during their operating period. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the effects of various surface coatings on the tribological characteristics of the automobile parts. In this study, the corrosion protective properties of Vacuum Arc Evaporation PVD coatings were investigated and the relation between corrosion protective properties was investigated...|$|R
40|$|A few {{among many}} {{otherwise}} highly successful lubricated sliding components fail catastrophically and without warning. This sudden {{mode of failure}} is often called scuffing. The phenomenon of scuffing {{has been known for}} many years and numerous {{attempts have been made to}} understand its processes and mechanisms. There is still, however, a general lack of agreement concerning the processes leading up <b>to</b> <b>scuffing.</b> One of the main reasons for this is that the detailed mechanisms of scuffing are not well understood. The main purpose of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the scuffing processes and material failure mechanisms under starved lubrication conditions. The research focuses on two major goals. The first is <b>to</b> examine the <b>scuffing</b> behavior of 52100 steel shoes/ 390 -T 6 Al plate contacts under starved lubrication conditions. The evaluation is based on a shoe-on-disc geometry which approximately simulates the swashplate/ shoe contacts in an automotive swashplate compressor. All tests are conducted in a high pressure tribometer (HPT) under R 134 a environment with a base polyalkylene glycol (PAG) lubricant. The effects of degree of lubricant starvation, sliding velocity, geometry of contact, surface topography, a tin coating, and socket geometry supporting the shoe are evaluated. The second goal is to study the processes and mechanisms of the scuffing phenomenon also under starved lubrication conditions. A pin-on-disc geometry is used to examine the effect of materials, lubricant/refrigerant mixtures and loading history on scuffing. The transition behavior of a 390 -T 6 Al pin sliding against a 1018 carburized steel disc is also examined. To better understand the processes and failure mechanisms of scuffing, the scuffed surfaces and subsurfaces are examined. Based on the experimental observations, a hypothesis and its corresponding criterion for scuffing under starved lubrication conditions are proposed. According <b>to</b> this hypothesis, <b>scuffing</b> is caused by the formation of macroscopic adhesions leading to bulk material failure due to plastic shearing.

50|$|Disc rot is {{a phrase}} {{describing}} {{the tendency of}} CD or DVD or other optical discs to become unreadable due to physical or chemical deterioration. The causes of this effect vary from oxidation of the reflective layer, <b>to</b> physical <b>scuffing</b> and abrasion of disc surfaces or edges, including visible scratches, to other kinds of reactions with contaminants, to ultra-violet light damage and de-bonding of the adhesive used to adhere the layers of the disc together.|$|R
