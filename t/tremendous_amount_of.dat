5|$|Because the liquid-to-gas {{expansion}} ratio of nitrogen is 1:694 at 20°C, a <b>tremendous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> force {{can be generated}} if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in an enclosed space. In an incident on January 12, 2006 at Texas A University, the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As {{a result of the}} subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2m off their foundations.|$|E
5|$|The {{landmark}} scientific expedition (December 1872 – May 1876) of the British Royal Navy {{survey ship}} HMS Challenger yielded a <b>tremendous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> bathymetric data, {{much of which}} has been confirmed by subsequent researchers. Bathymetric data obtained {{during the course of the}} Challenger expedition enabled scientists to draw maps, which provided a rough outline of certain major submarine terrain features, such as the edge of the continental shelves and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This discontinuous set of data points was obtained by the simple technique of taking soundings by lowering long lines from the ship to the seabed.|$|E
5|$|Their {{high energy}} and drive make these dogs {{ideally suited to}} a number of {{different}} dog sports such as flyball or agility. Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners, as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized. Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment dweller unless the owner is ready to take on the daunting task of providing the dog with the necessary amount of exercise and stimulation. They have a <b>tremendous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> energy for their size, a fact which can sometimes lead to trouble involving larger animals. They may seem never to tire and will still be energetic after their owner has called it a day. While socialised members of the breed are friendly towards children, they will not tolerate abuse even if it is unintentional.|$|E

5|$|Nicole {{produced}} a <b>tremendous</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> rain in Jamaica, totaling to 37.42in (950.5mm) in Belleisle. Severe flooding and landslides affected up to 507,831 residents, resulting 16 deaths and 42 injuries. Flooded roadways isolated communities, trapping {{hundreds of people}} in their homes. Over 288,000 residences lost power, over 40 percent of the island's water supply systems were inoperable at one point, and dozens of bridges collapsed. Infrastructure damage totaled to $235.4 million, while property damage reached $3.2 million and agricultural damage amounted to $6.8 million. In nearby Cuba, rainfall reached 9.22in (234mm) and winds gusted to 53mph (85km/h); houses were flooded, crops were damaged, and livestock was killed as a result. Similar impacts occurred across the Cayman Islands, with sporadic power outages, flooding in low-lying locations, and damaged houses. While the remnants of Nicole produced only minor impacts across Florida, mainly {{in the form of}} street flooding, impacts were much more severe across the Mid-Atlantic as the system combined with a large area of low pressure across the region. Record-breaking rainfall, accumulating to 22.54in (572.5mm) in Wilmington, North Carolina, closed over 150 roadways, knocked out power, and caused traffic accidents.|$|E
