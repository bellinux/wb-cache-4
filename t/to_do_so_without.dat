5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Dean applied to the US Military Academy, but was rejected. He then tried to enlist in the United States Army during World War I, {{but he was too}} young <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>without</b> his parents' permission, and his mother refused. Dean instead {{attended}} University of California at Berkeley studying pre-law. During this time, he also took a variety of side jobs, including a stevedore at the San Francisco docks, a motorman, and briefly as a patrolman for the Berkeley Police Department, where he worked under police chief August Vollmer. Dean originally sought to attain a Doctor of Law degree but only completed a Bachelor of Arts degree from Berkeley in 1922 before joining the Army.|$|E
5|$|At 6 p.m. the {{regiment}} {{was ordered to}} withdraw. It had lost almost all of its tanks and taken 42 casualties killed or wounded. In reserve, {{the regiment}} was issued with new tanks, a hasty mix of Shermans, Grants, and Crusaders (types II and III), mostly salvaged from the battlefield and rapidly repaired. Montgomery had been impressed {{with the performance of}} the 2nd New Zealand Division and wanted them to spearhead the next thrust, but Freyberg was unwilling <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>without</b> reinforcements, as his troops had suffered so many casualties. Montgomery therefore placed 151 (from 50th Division) and 152 Infantry (from 51st Division) brigades under Freyberg's command for the next phase of the battle.|$|E

Frozen became the first film since Avatar to reach first place in its sixth weekend of wide release. It remained in the top 10 {{at the box office}} for sixteen consecutive weekends (the longest run by any film since 2002) and achieved large weekend grosses from its fifth to its twelfth weekend (of wide release), compared to other films in their respective weekends.

5|$|Firefighters began {{experiencing}} {{problems before}} they even reached the fire. By the time firefighters reached the 11th floor the building had lost power after {{the heat from the}} blaze damaged electrical cables. The emergency generator never began producing electricity, and despite efforts to restore power the building was without electricity for the entirety of the event. This forced firefighters to work in darkness and without the aid of elevators. In addition, the transformers that provided power to the neighboring Girard Trust Building were in the basement of One Meridian Plaza. The transformers were eventually shut down due to water accumulation in the basement and firefighters directing water streams from that building had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>without</b> the aid of elevators.|$|E
5|$|Northcott {{spent much}} of his time from 1943 on in a long battle with the {{government}} over the number of men and women allocated to the Army. He attempted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>without</b> Blamey being dragged into a political fight but this proved to be impossible. In September 1944, the government reduced the Army's monthly intake of women from 925 to 500, while it only received 420 out of 4,020 men allocated to the three services. Such a meagre allocation was below what the Army needed to maintain its strength, and formations had to be disbanded. Blamey took up the matter with Prime Minister John Curtin, and managed to get a more satisfactory monthly allocation of 1,500 men per month out of 3,000 allocated to the three services.|$|E
5|$|The colours {{would have}} first {{appeared}} bright and crisp, but over five-and-a-half centuries the painting has acquired layers of grey dirt which darken {{the tone and}} render the colours faint and pallid. Normally these layers of dirt would be removed by restorers, but given the delicate and fragile nature of a work painted in a water-soluble medium, it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>without</b> removing large amounts of pigment. The colours as they appear today have faded from their original hues. The Virgin's mantle is now brown but would have been painted as blue. Joseph's tabard, once blue, now appears as green. The original indigos of the landscape are lost, while the azurite in Nicodemus's collar has darkened.|$|E

5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known the contents of the document and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents {{and the nature of the}} contents of the document, and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>without</b> police authorization, or communicating the contents of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Walt's wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) observes {{his car in}} her {{driveway}} and, not wishing her son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte) to see it, drives it a {{few blocks}} away to conceal it. Concerned about Walt's apparent disappearance, she calls their lawyer Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk), but he has become paranoid from Walt's falling out with Gus and is too busy checking his office for listening devices. Skyler hires a locksmith to break into Walt's condo for her, claiming it belongs to her. When he hesitates <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>without</b> identification, Skyler claims her purse was stolen and fakes a panic attack until he finally agrees. She finds little of interest inside the condo. Elsewhere, Skyler's sister Marie (Betsy Brandt) struggles to maintain her composure while caring for her belligerent husband Hank (Dean Norris), who is still bedridden after the attempt on his life.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the {{pressure}} on Stephen to get Eustace confirmed as his legitimate heir continued to grow. The King gave Eustace the County of Boulogne in 1147, but it remained unclear whether Eustace would inherit England. Stephen's preferred option was to have Eustace crowned while he himself was still alive, as was the custom in France, {{but this was not}} the normal practice in England, and Celestine II, during his brief tenure as pope between 1143 and 1144, had banned any change to this practice. Since the only person who could crown Eustace was Archbishop Theobald, who refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>without</b> agreement from the current pope, Eugene III, the matter reached an impasse. At the end of 1148, Stephen and Theobald came to a temporary compromise that allowed Theobald to return to England. Theobald was appointed a papal legate in 1151, adding to his authority. Stephen then made a fresh attempt to have Eustace crowned at Easter 1152, gathering his nobles to swear fealty to Eustace, and then insisting that Theobald and his bishops anoint him king. When Theobald refused yet again, Stephen and Eustace imprisoned both him and the bishops and refused to release them unless they agreed to crown Eustace. Theobald escaped again into temporary exile in Flanders, pursued to the coast by Stephen's knights, marking a low point in Stephen's relationship with the church.|$|E

5|$|The German {{offensive}} {{caught the}} Red Army by surprise and made large gains {{on the first}} day. The spearhead forces enjoyed air support {{and were able to}} defeat counterattacks by Soviet troops. By 13 December, Soviet resistance slowed the German advance considerably. Although German forces took the area surrounding Verkhne-Kumskiy, the Red Army launched Operation Little Saturn on 16 December. Operation Little Saturn crushed the Italian 8th Army on Army Group Don's left flank, threatening the survival of Manstein's entire group of forces. As resistance and casualties increased, Manstein appealed to Hitler and to the commander of the German 6th Army, General Friedrich Paulus, to allow the 6th Army to break out of Stalingrad; both refused. The 4th Panzer Army continued its attempt to open a corridor to the 6th Army on 18–19 December, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>without</b> the aid of forces inside the Stalingrad pocket. Manstein was forced to call off the assault on 23 December and by Christmas Eve the 4th Panzer Army began to withdraw to its starting position. Due to the failure of the 6th Army to breakout and the attempt to break the Soviet encirclement, the Red Army was able to continue the strangulation of German forces in Stalingrad.|$|E

25|$|Howard Rheingold cites mobile {{communications}} technology {{as a key}} enabler: The bees sense each other's buzzing and instinctually move in concert in real time. Text messaging on mobile devices and instantaneous file sharing off the internet via PDAs allows groups of people to receive their instructions, move in unison, nearly instantaneously, without prior planning or forethought. And, the technology allows groups <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>without</b> a central leader. One modern example is the protesters at the World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle, in 1999, {{who were able to}} orchestrate their movement effectively in this way.|$|E

An attempt was made by the Duke of Wellington in September 1830 to induce Palmerston to re-enter the cabinet, but he refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>without</b> Lord Lansdowne and Lord Grey, two notable Whigs.
