The complaint also alleges that entry and expansion in the outsourced UCM market for large, multi-state employers is made more difficult by {{the large number of}} customers tied to long-term contracts. Entry and expansion are also made more difficult by non-compete and non-solicitation agreements between TALX and its employees, which reduce the number of experienced persons available for hiring by potential competitors.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{intends to}} analyze and clarify <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> within air {{passenger}} transport. Further the thesis intends to investigate {{if there is any}} difference in air passenger transport in accordance to more general business. The definition of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> is an essential step in order to establish a breach under European competition law. <b>The</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> includes <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> product <b>market</b> and <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> geographic <b>market.</b> <b>The</b> fundamental issue in <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> product <b>market</b> is whether products are considered to be substitutable and can constitute the same market. The Commission has set a notice which includes methods and criterias and serves as guidelines to courts and companies to define <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>market.</b> <b>The</b> notice is however not binding for courts. The CJ have developed implementation of the criterias which it tends to refer to even if it is a different branch, however a case-by-case based definition is needed. The definition of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> is based on three main criterias: demand substitutability, supply substitutability and potential competition. Even though the supply substitutability seems not be implemented in a further extension in more general branches, it seems to be of greater importance when defining <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> within air passenger transport. The air passenger transport has also established a test called base of origin and base of destination which includes an analysis of price, travel frequencies, comfort of the journey, transfer time to terminals and differences in the qualities and quantities in airports.   However according to air passenger transport, travel sequences seems to be the criteria that courts focus most on...|$|R

50|$|From 1999 on, a new {{branch in}} Budapest, dyras wwe.trading Kft.

Besides marketing and further promoting the brand, its responsibilities included monitoring <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>markets,</b> assessing consumer trends and competitors.The products were primarily distributed to multinationals such as Auchan, KIKA, Metro, Penny Market, Praktiker, Rossmann and Tesco.|$|E
50|$|The {{notion of}} {{relevant}} market {{is used in}} order to identify the products and undertakings which are directly competing in a business. Therefore, the relevant market is the market where the competition takes place. The enforcement of the provisions of competition law would be not possible without referring to the market where competition takes place. The extent to which firms are able to increase their prices above normal competition levels depends on the possibility for consumers to buy substitute goods and the ability for other firms to supply those products. The fewer the substitute products and/or the more difficult it is for other firms to begin to supply those products, the less elastic the demand curve is and the more probable is to find higher prices. For all these reasons it is necessary to define <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>markets</b> for the different cases which fall under the Law.|$|E

5000|$|To be able {{to operate}} as a {{commercial}} business entity, the modern corporation requires a legal framework of regulation and oversight within which to exploit <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>markets</b> profitably. The infrastructure of law and commerce are provided {{by the government of}} each state in which the corporation desires to trade, and there is an inevitable linkage between the political and commercial interests.

50|$|The Federal Trade Commission {{announced}} April 2008 that it {{issued a}} complaint challenging {{a series of}} acquisitions by TALX Corporation that substantially lessened competition in the markets for outsourced unemployment compensation management (UCM) and verification of income and employment (VOIE) services. The Commission and TALX have reached an agreement settling the Commission's challenge. “TALX acted illegally,” says Jeffrey Schmidt, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, “by acquiring virtually all of its competition {{in a series of}} transactions. While each transaction individually may not have been problematic, the FTC looked at the cumulative effect of the acquisitions. This case sends a message that firms can’t get away with unlawful acquisitions just because they take place in relatively small increments.” The complaint alleges that TALX's acquisitions have enhanced its ability to increase prices unilaterally and to decrease the quality of services in <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>markets.</b> In addition, the complaint notes, TALX has alliance partners, including Automated Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), Convergys, Inc., and Ceridian, Inc., which have agreements with TALX to outsource to TALX {{some or all of the}} UCM services they provide for their clients.|$|E

40|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, {{it is likely that}} the market {{definition}} approach will remain an important tool in competition policy analysis for some time, despite the increased importance of other tools such as the simulation approach. Against the background of the new block exemption regulation for cars in Europe, we explore an econometric approach to define <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>markets</b> with differentiated products. On the one hand, the approach is directly consistent with the SSNIP-test, and it is in fact more satisfactory than previous approaches, such as critical elasticity analysis or the simple use of standard industry classifications. On the other hand, the approach shares a lot of features with the simulation approach (similar data requirements, and similar assumptions about current market power). We find that the relevant market for minivan cars is defined at the widest level, i. e. at the aggregate country level. Furthermore, in Italy <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>markets</b> for domestic cars are defined at an intermediate level, i. e. at the segment level. In all other cases, <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>markets</b> for cars may be defined at the narrowest level, i. e. at the subsegment level. Based on these results, we identify the firms that may violate the market share thresholds stipulated in the block exemption regulation. We find that, if we would have used an approach based on standard industry classifications instead of our econometric approach, our conclusions would have been different and, in fact, inconclusive. We also draw attention to other issues in market definition that may be of use to practitioners. competition policy; market definition...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this final thesis is the {{definition}} of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> for <b>the</b> purpose of the EU competition law. The main purpose of this thesis is to provide the structured summary of the rules on the definition of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>market</b> as these have been mostly determined by the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Commission. The case-law provided by these institutions has formed the main source of this thesis, however, the literature, in particular English, has also formed an important source. The final thesis is divided into four main chapters. The first one deals with the EU competition law in general, its position within the EU law and its significance for establishing the common market and attaining the main goals of the European integration. The first chapter also provides the sources of the EU competition law and the institutions supervising the observation thereof, i. e. the European Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Within this framework we show that the distributors have incentives to internalize the fact that viewers dislike ads on TV, but no incentives to internalize how the TV channel’s profits from the advertising market are affected by end-user prices. This leads to some surprising results. First, we show that even undifferentiated distributors might make positive profits. Second, a TV channel might find it optimal to commit to not raising advertising revenue. Third, regulation of the advertising volume might be welfare improving even if the unregulated advertising level is too low from a social point of view...|$|E
