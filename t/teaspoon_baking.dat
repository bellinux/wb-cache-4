5000|$|One cup of Bisquick can be {{substituted}} by a mixture of one cup of flour, [...] <b>teaspoons</b> of <b>baking</b> powder, [...] <b>teaspoon</b> of salt, and [...] tablespoons of oil or melted butter (or by cutting in [...] tbsp Crisco or lard).|$|R
50|$|Generally one {{teaspoon}} (5 g) {{of baking}} powder {{is used to}} raise a mixture of one cup (125 g) of flour, one cup of liquid, and one egg. However, if the mixture is acidic, baking powder's additional acids will remain unconsumed in the chemical reaction and often lend an unpleasant taste to food. High acidity {{can be caused by}} ingredients like buttermilk, lemon juice, yogurt, citrus or honey. When excessive acid is present, some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda. For example, one cup of flour, one egg, and one cup of buttermilk requires only ½ <b>teaspoon</b> of <b>baking</b> powder—the remaining leavening is caused by buttermilk acids reacting with ¼ <b>teaspoon</b> of <b>baking</b> soda.|$|R
50|$|A typical modern {{recipe for}} 12 cakes {{requires}} about 200 g of flour, 100 g of butter or margarine, 50 g of sugar, 1 beaten egg, 1 <b>teaspoon</b> of <b>baking</b> powder, 2 tablespoons of milk, 150 g of dried fruit such as currants, raisins, candied orange peel, etc., and {{a pinch of}} nutmeg and mixed spices. Usually, flour and butter are first mixed until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs; then the other ingredients are added to create a stiff dough, which is dropped from a spoon to a baking tray or roughly formed with two forks. The cakes (optionally sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon) are baked for about 15 minutes at 200 °C, retaining an uneven form and contour.|$|R
50|$|Hartshorn salt (ammonium carbonate), {{also known}} simply as hartshorn, and baker's ammonia, {{was used as a}} {{leavening}} agent, in the baking of cookies and other edible treats. It was used mainly in {{the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries}} as a forerunner of baking powder. A half-teaspoon of hartshorn can substitute for one <b>teaspoon</b> of <b>baking</b> powder. It is called for in old German and Scandinavian recipes and, although rarely used in modern times, may still be purchased as a baking ingredient. Hartshorn helps molded cookies such as Springerle to retain their intricate designs during baking. Cookies made with hartshorn can be kept for a long time without hardening. Use of hartshorn may turn some ingredients, such as sunflower seeds, green.|$|R
40|$|Patients with HIV {{infection}} {{may develop}} common diseases with atypical clinical features. HIV infection {{can change the}} classic clinical course of syphilis and increase the incidence of malignant syphilis. Malignant syphilis is a rare subtype of secondary syphilis that presents special clinical and histological features and {{has been associated with}} several processes characterized by variable degrees of immunosuppression. It is necessary to consider the possibility of this entity in the differential diagnoses in HIV-infected patients with cutaneous lesions. The dental surgeon (or oral surgeon) is vital to the medical team for promoting the health and improving {{the quality of life of}} syphilis patients. A patient with HIV infection was referred to us for complaints of a white patch on the tongue, stinging and burning sensation on the tongue, loss of taste, and dryness of the mouth. On clinical examination, the patient was found to have a tabetic gait (the Prussian soldier gait) associated with Charcot arthropathy. We also identified bilateral lesions with ulceration and exposure of the tissue that were tender, characterized by discrete necrosis. The treatment that was initiated at that time involved cleaning the area with gauze to remove all the white patches, followed by rinsing with bicarbonate in water (one <b>teaspoon</b> of <b>baking</b> soda dissolved in half a glass of water) four times a day. Additionally, fluconazole (100 mg/day for 7 days) was prescribed. We diagnosed secondary malignant syphilis of approximately 5 days duration. As an adjunctive therapy, we performed low-intensity laser treatment using a GaAsAl (gallium-aluminum arsenide) laser at 790 nm. With this treatment there was progressive resolution of the lesions...|$|R
