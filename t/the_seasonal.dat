40|$|Online {{short-term}} load forecasting {{is needed}} for the real-time scheduling of electricity generation. Univariate methods have been developed that model the intraweek and intraday seasonal cycles in intraday load data. Three such methods, shown to be competitive in recent empirical studies, are double seasonal ARMA, an adaptation of Holt-Winters exponential smoothing for double seasonality, and another, recently proposed, exponential smoothing method. In multiple years of load data, in addition to intraday and intraweek cycles, an intrayear seasonal cycle is also apparent. We extend <b>the</b> three double <b>seasonal</b> methods {{in order to accommodate}} <b>the</b> intrayear <b>seasonal</b> cycle.

The system has altered <b>the</b> <b>seasonal</b> flow of the river in order to meet higher electricity demands during the winter.
