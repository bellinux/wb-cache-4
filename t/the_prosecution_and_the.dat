5|$|Taylor was {{the first}} Compulsory Process Clause case since Washington v. Texas to provide a {{specific}} limitation {{on the right of}} defendants to force their witnesses to testify. In that case, the Court construed a defendant's right very broadly in his ability to present a defense. Here, however, the Court restricted that ability to comply with court rules, especially if those rules were of equal consequence upon both <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> defense. This decision was reached over the dissent of three Justices, all of whom felt a defendant's case should not be limited based on an error solely by the defendant's attorney to list appropriate witnesses.|$|E
25|$|At the trial's {{conclusion}} — after <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{defense had}} presented their cases — the jury took 54 minutes on March 1, 1969, to find Clay Shaw not guilty.|$|E
25|$|At the {{sentencing}} stage, the mandatory death penalty precluded the court from considering {{the circumstances in}} which the offence was committed. This denied <b>the</b> <b>Prosecution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> public of information on the type of offenders likely to reoffend, and impeded the legislature from determining if the mandatory death penalty was actually necessary.|$|E

50|$|Defense {{lawyers and}} media outlets (who {{were quick to}} {{initially}} condemn the accused players) were strongly critical of Nifong's handling of the case.

25|$|James Kirkland Batson was an African American man {{convicted of}} {{burglary}} and receipt of stolen goods in a Louisville, Kentucky circuit court {{by a jury}} composed entirely of white jurors. The key part of his appeal {{was based on the}} jury selection, or voir dire, phase of the trial. During this phase potential jurors are examined by the Court, <b>the</b> <b>prosecution,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> defense, to determine their competence, willingness, and suitability to hear, deliberate and decide a case put to them to render a verdict. During voir dire the judge can dismiss jurors and both <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> defense have a limited number of peremptory challenges, which are accepted on their face, as the right of the party making the challenge and which they use to excuse any juror for any reason which the particular side believes will help their case.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> defense appealed on December 24, 2002, and {{the case}} moved to the Supreme Court of Japan on December 10, 2002.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> defense {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of the day delivering conflicting portrayals of the Pirate Bay.

25|$|The answer, he said, would largely {{depend on}} the way in which {{sovereignty}} was said to have been acquired. He observed that although the legal authorities claimed that sovereignty over Australia was acquired by occupation, the country was not vacant, but already occupied; nor had it been conquered or ceded under a treaty. Rather, Judge Willis said, sovereignty was actually acquired under the principle expounded by Vattel in his The Law of Nations, referred to by both <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> defence, that a 'civilised' people may take possession of territory occupied by 'uncivilised' people, provided they leave for them sufficient land for their sustenance.|$|E
25|$|Bradlee {{has drawn}} {{criticism}} from several quarters for his perjury at the 1965 {{trial of the}} man accused of murdering Mary Pinchot Meyer, who was shot to death on October 12, 1964 while walking on the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal towpath in Georgetown. Attorneys for both <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> defense (Alfred Hantman and Dovey J. Roundtree), in addition to D.C. Police Detective Bernie Crooke, along with authors Peter Janney and Nina Burleigh, have all noted the significant difference between the limited information Bradlee divulged under oath at the 1965 trial, and what he revealed 30 years later in his 1995 memoir A Good Life.|$|E
500|$|The closing {{arguments}} were heard on 9 and 10 November 2009. <b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> co-plaintiffs {{argued for a}} conviction for murder and attempted murder, with the legal specification [...] "heinous crime". The defence argued for a conviction for manslaughter and attempted manslaughter, by reasoning that the killing was {{in the heat of}} the moment and that the defendant may have a paranoid personality disorder. The verdict was delayed because the requested medical information from Russian authorities that arrived 9 November 2009 attested [...] "undifferentiated schizophrenia" [...] in 2000, thereby requiring additional testimony by a medical expert witness.|$|E
25|$|Bakir accused <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> team (chief {{prosecutor}} Ida Bagus Wiswantanu) {{of seeking}} a bribe {{to reduce the}} requested sentence. <b>The</b> <b>prosecution</b> team <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Indonesian government vehemently denied that this occurred.

500|$|Sadiki's lawyer, Robert Bloom, {{attempted}} {{to have the}} trial dismissed and then postponed due to new [...] "revelations" [...] regarding the credibility of White, a former co-defendant working for the prosecution. Bloom {{had been assigned to}} defend Hilton over the summer, but White was not disclosed as a government witness until right before the trial. Judge Gagliardi instructed both <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> defense not to bring up Shakur or Sadiki's connections to the BLA, saying they were [...] "not relevant." [...] Gagliardi denied requests by the jurors to pose questions to the witnesses—either directly or through him—and declined to provide the jury with information they requested about how long the defense had been given to prepare, saying it was [...] "none of their concern." [...] This trial resulted in a hung jury and then a mistrial when the jury reported to Gagliardi that they were hopelessly deadlocked for the fourth time.|$|E

2500|$|The Crown {{successfully}} appealed Judge Fontaine's {{decision and}} {{the charges were}} reinstated.

2500|$|H.L. Mencken's trial {{reports were}} heavily slanted against <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> jury, which were [...] "unanimously hot for Genesis." [...] He mocked the town's {{inhabitants}} as [...] "yokels" [...] and [...] "morons." [...] He called Bryan a [...] "buffoon" [...] and his speeches [...] "theologic bilge." [...] In contrast, {{he called the}} defense [...] "eloquent" [...] and [...] "magnificent." [...] Even today, some American creationists, fighting in courts and state legislatures to demand that creationism be taught {{on an equal footing}} with evolution in the schools, have claimed that it was Mencken's trial reports in 1925 that turned public opinion against creationism. The media's portrayal of Darrow's cross-examination of Bryan, and the play and movie Inherit the Wind (1960), caused millions of Americans to ridicule religious-based opposition to the theory of evolution.|$|E
2500|$|Governor Chris Christie's {{political}} standing {{was badly}} {{damaged by the}} scandal. Once considered a leading contender for the 2016 Republican nomination for President, Christie {{dropped out of the}} presidential race after a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary. The scandal was widely cited as {{a major factor in the}} early demise of Christie's 2016 presidential ambitions. Christie called Bridgegate [...] "a factor" [...] in why he was bypassed by Donald Trump as the vice presidential nominee. [...] In September 2016, both <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> defense in the trial of two of Christie's former aides argued that Christie knew of his close associates' involvement in a plan to shut down lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge as it was happening, and that the closings were to punish Sokolich for declining to support Christie's reelection bid.

According to Karpal, Najib's testimony {{would be able to}} introduce fresh evidence to the case, and his requests were justifiable as per Section 425 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) which allows a court to [...] "summon or recall any person as a witness in a trial", as well as [...] "summon or recall any such person if his evidence appears to the court to be essential to the just decision of the case." [...] On 23 July 2008 the petition notice was rejected by the High Court.

2500|$|Rezko {{pleaded not}} guilty, {{and the trial}} related to his charges from Operation Board Games began on March 6, 2008. He was jailed shortly before the trial began when he {{received}} a $3.5million wire transfer from Lebanon. Rezko had told the court {{that he had no}} access to money from overseas. Ten weeks into the trial, on April 18, Judge Amy St. Eve released Rezko, after friends and relatives put up 30 properties valued at about $8.5million to secure his bond. Prosecutors opposed the motion for release, saying that Rezko was a flight risk. On May 6, both <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> defense rested their cases. Government prosecutors spent 8 weeks presenting their case. Rezko’s lawyer, Joseph J. Duffy, chose not to present any witnesses, saying that he did not believe that the prosecution had proven the charges. Prosecutors contended that they had shown Rezko's [...] "corrupt use of his power and influence" [...] to gain benefits for himself and his friends. Duffy argued that the prosecution had exaggerated Rezko's influence in state government, and attacked Levine's credibility as a witness.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ultimate}} task of a {{judge is}} to settle a legal dispute in a final and public manner, and thus affirm the rule of law. Before the trial, a pre-trial investigation collecting the facts has been conducted by police officials, such as police officers and coroners, prosecutors or public procurators. The court usually has three main legally trained court officials: the judge, the prosecutor and the defence attorney. The role {{of a judge}} varies between legal systems. In an adversarial system (common law), as in effect in the U.S. and England, the judge functions as an impartial referee, mainly ensuring correct procedure, while <b>the</b> <b>prosecution</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> defense present their case to a jury, often selected from common citizens. The main factfinder is the jury, and the judge will then finalize sentencing. Nevertheless, in smaller cases judges can issue summary judgments without proceeding to a jury trial. In an inquisitorial system (civil law), as in effect in continental Europe, there is no jury and the main factfinder is the judge, who will do the presiding, judging and sentencing on his own. As such, the judge is expected to apply the law directly, as in the French expression Le juge est la bouche de la loi ("The judge is {{the mouth of the}} law"). Furthermore, in some system even investigation may be conducted by the judge, functioning as an examining magistrate.|$|E
