40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} <b>calibration</b> {{of joint}} <b>torque</b> sensors and {{identification of a}} gravity compensation (GComp) model. The two problems are related: calibrated torque information is prerequisite for the GComp model identification; the identified GComp model makes on-line automatic <b>torque</b> sensor <b>calibration</b> possible. In the first part, we propose an autonomous joint <b>torque</b> sensor <b>calibration</b> method, which utilizes combinations of single-joint rotations and an arm's own gravity load. The method determines not only joint torque sensor gains and offsets, but also those of the joint angle sensors. When one joint of a manipulator is rotated, the gravity torque exerted on the joint varies sinusoidally with rotation angle. From the fitted parameters one may extract sensor gains and offsets. A custom designed calibration load is used to provide a reference torque for <b>torque</b> sensor gain <b>calibration.</b> A key feature of the proposed method is that nothing is assumed known about the arm's inertial parameters or of {{the location of the}} reference load in the grasp. Experiments are conducted on the Sarcos Dextrous Arm. The second part of the thesis presents a new and simple procedure to identify link mass parameters used for gravity compensation and on-line automatic <b>torque</b> sensor <b>calibration</b> for a robot manipulator. The approach employs a single-joint rotation and a recursive procedure that proceeds distally to proximally. Composite mass moments are identified for each link, and are further divided into configuration dependent and independent terms. It is shown that the configuration-independent terms may actually combine contributions from several links. Simulation and experimental results on the Sarcos Dextrous Arm verify the approach...|$|R

30|$|Torque is an {{important}} parameter of a mechanical power system, which reflects transmission efficiency, transmission reliability, and operating conditions of equipment. Torque monitoring {{is very important for}} real-time control and fault diagnosis of mechanical equipment. A torque measurement method based on the theory of magnetic effect is proposed for multipoint torque monitoring in shafting. A model of the deflection angle of the magnetization vector and torque is established based on the theory of magnetic equivalent. A non-contact signal extraction circuit based on hall sensor is designed, a torque loading experimental device is set up, and the <b>torque</b> <b>calibration</b> experiment is completed. The experimental results show that the sensitivity of the torque measurement system is 17.7  mV/Nm, and the maximum nonlinear error is 0.77 % full scale. The deflection angle of the magnetization vector has a good linear relation with the torque, which can be measured indirectly by the deflection angle. This method has the advantages of a simple device, strong anti-interference ability, and non-contact measurement. Because {{it is not necessary to}} do special treatment to the elastic shaft, it is convenient to form a non-contact torque sensing node, which can realize real-time monitoring of multipoint torque of shafting.|$|E

40|$|The role {{of input}} noise is seldom {{considered}} in robot calibration. The methodology of total least squares may {{be applied to}} handle both input and output noise in robot calibration. Experimentally, we apply this method towards joint <b>torque</b> sensor <b>calibration,</b> and towards kinematic calibration of a redundant parallel-drive spherical joint in a variant called the implicit loop method. 1. Introduction Previous work in robot calibration has almost exclusively employed Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), applied in nonlinear cases to the linearized equations iteratively. The premise for OLS is that the output or dependent variable in an explicit equation is {{the only source of}} measurement error. Yet errors in the input or independent variables are often significant, and the use of OLS in the presence of input error or noise is known to lead to bias errors in the estimates [10]. The issue of input noise is known in the statistics literature as the errors-invariables problem [3]. Figure 1 A illustra [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{highest level}} of <b>torque</b> <b>calibration</b> is {{achieved}} by direct loading and, due {{to the use of}} mass stacks, is associated with the step-by-step method. In order to fit the demand of applications especially in industry, calibration devices with the ability of performing continuous loading were developed which are working as reference machines. A benefit of continuous methods is that the time for a loading-unloading cycle can be ten times or more shorter than using the step method. This fast change in torque leads to conditions of use that cannot be represented in the national torque standards. Therefore the appointed reference- and transfer-transducers should have negligible sensitivity to fast loading effects. With such transducers the results of slow absolute calibrations in the national torque standards are valid also in the fast continuous-working machines. In Germany a guideline treating this problems of continuous calibration is in preparation at a working group of the German Calibration Service (DKD). In this guideline special qualification-tests are proposed which can be performed in existing direct loading machines and which can deliver information about the suitability of transducers as reference or transfer for continuous working machines. In this paper we describe these qualification-tests, discuss the results of the tests in comparison to the behaviour of the tested transducers in continuous measurements and recommendations for the selection of transducers for continuous use are given...|$|E
