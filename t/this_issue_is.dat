5|$|During the 1930s, {{and again}} during the 1950s, the {{relationship}} between the loanable funds doctrine and the liquidity preference theory were discussed at length. Some authors considered the two approaches as largely equivalent but <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> still unresolved.|$|E
5|$|The Chalk River reactor {{was shut}} down for {{maintenance}} in August 2009, and reopened in August 2010. The Petten reactor had a 6-month scheduled maintenance shutdown on Friday, February 19, 2010, and reopened September 2010. With millions of procedures relying on technetium-99m every year, the low supply has left a gap, leaving some practitioners to revert to techniques not used for 20 years. Somewhat allaying <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> an announcement from the Polish Maria research reactor that they have developed a technique to isolate technetium.|$|E

5|$|These fossils {{have been}} {{preserved}} in a distinctive style known as Burgess shale type preservation, which preserves fairly tough tissues such as cuticle as thin films, and soft tissues as solid shapes, quickly enough that decay has not destroyed them. Moderately soft tissues, such as muscles, are lost. Scientists are still unsure about {{the processes that}} created these fossils. While {{there is little doubt}} that the animals were buried under catastrophic flows of sediment, it is uncertain whether they were transported by the flows from other locations, or lived in the area where they were buried, or were a mixture of local and transported specimens. <b>This</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> closely related to whether conditions around the burial sites were anoxic or had a moderate supply of oxygen. Anoxic conditions are generally thought the most favourable for fossilization, but imply that the animals could not have lived where they were buried.|$|E
5|$|The {{planning}} {{system is}} critical to the viability and operation of GA aerodromes. With many cities lacking scheduled air transport services between them, and with GA access to commercial airports becoming increasingly difficult and expensive, a viable network of aerodromes supporting GA air transport operations is regarded as an important national issue. However, there is no unified national planning policy specific to GA aerodromes, and planning decisions relating to these are based on local issues that are not required to consider the national impact. Because aircraft are excluded from noise control legislation, the only recourse for people affected by aircraft noise is through the planning process, and <b>this</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> the principal factor on which the majority of planning decisions relating to GA land use are made. GA is a specialist subject often unfamiliar to Local Planning Authorities, and most planning decisions relating to GA either refuse permission, or grant it with restrictive conditions. Little Gransden is just one example of a GA airfield required to comply with planning restrictions on the number of movements permitted, thereby inhibiting further development. Such restrictions, if poorly conceived, can make GA operations unviable or even unsafe.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{differences}} between Sydney {{and the majority of}} other Anglican dioceses in Australia has been its unwillingness to allow the ordination of women to the priesthood (itself a term infrequently used in the diocese) or presbyterate. <b>This</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> an indicator of Sydney's specificity in ecclesiology and theology to most other dioceses within the Anglican Communion.|$|E
25|$|In 1917, the New York Post office {{returned}} {{a batch of}} imperforate 2-cent stamps from the 1908-09 issue (double line watermark, two spelled out) to Washington for credit. Rather than remitting cash, however, the Federal Post Office in effect transformed these stamps into a new issue by perforating them with the then-current gauge—perforated 11—and returned them to New York.

25|$|Codec hell (a term {{derived from}} DLL hell) is when {{multiple}} DirectShow filters conflict for performing the same task. A {{large number of}} companies now develop codecs {{in the form of}} DirectShow filters, resulting in the presence of several filters that can decode the same media type. <b>This</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> further exacerbated by DirectShow's merit system, where filter implementations end up competing with one another by registering themselves with increasingly elevated priority.|$|E
25|$|Termination of {{eukaryotic}} DNA replication requires different processes {{depending on}} whether the chromosomes are circular or linear. Unlike linear molecules, circular chromosomes are able to replicate the entire molecule. However, the two DNA molecules will remain linked together. <b>This</b> <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> handled by decatenation of the two DNA molecules by a type II topoisomerase. Type II topoisomerases are also used to separate linear strands as they are intricately folded into a nucleosome within the cell.|$|E
