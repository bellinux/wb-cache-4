5|$|It is {{commonly}} and erroneously, {{believed that a}} Sejm was first disrupted by the liberum veto by a Trakai deputy, Władysław Siciński, in 1652. In reality, he vetoed only {{the continuation of the}} Sejm's deliberations beyond the statutory time limit. He had, however, set up a dangerous precedent. Over <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> of the next few sejms, the veto was still occasionally overruled, but it became gradually more accepted. Before 20 years had passed, in 1669 in Kraków, the entire Sejm was prematurely disrupted on the strength of the liberum veto before it had finished its deliberations by the Kiev deputy, Adam Olizar. The practice spiraled out of control, and in 1688, the Sejm was dissolved even before <b>the</b> <b>proceedings</b> had begun or the Marshal of the Sejm was elected.|$|E

40|$|Resumé This thesis titled The Scope of the Prosecutor in <b>the</b> Preliminary Criminal <b>Proceedings</b> {{presents}} a compact {{view on the}} prosecutor's role and activities in <b>the</b> preliminary <b>proceedings.</b> At this stage, the prosecutor has a vital role and {{is regarded as the}} master of <b>the</b> preliminary <b>proceedings</b> (dominus litis), for he carries the ultimate responsibility for its results. In <b>the</b> court <b>proceedings,</b> where he is accorded the party status, the prosecutor represents the public prosecution. In relation to the police authorities, the prosecutor has a number of privileges that enable him to supervise the adherence of legality in <b>the</b> preliminary <b>proceedings.</b> <b>The</b> work is divided into four main chapters. The first chapter discusses the legal base of prosecution as a body of public prosecution in <b>the</b> criminal <b>proceedings.</b> This chapter also characterizes the institute of external and internal supervision within the system of prosecution. The second chapter defines <b>the</b> preliminary <b>proceedings</b> as an obligatory, pre-trial part of every criminal proceeding. Furthermore, this chapter elaborates individual functions of <b>the</b> preliminary <b>proceedings,</b> including its forms and stages.
