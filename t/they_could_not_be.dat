60|$|Q. Can {{you make}} this appear by experience?--A. Yes: {{the first things that}} bloom and put forth {{themselves}} in children, shew their ignorance of God, their disobedience to parents, and their innate enmity to holiness of life; their inclinations naturally run to vanity. Besides little children die, but that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not,</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> <b>not</b> of God counted sinners; for death is the wages of sin (Rom 6:23).|$|R
5|$|A re-think was required. Cook had the unenviable task of {{explaining}} {{the failure to}} the government. Henceforth, he would take a tighter grip on the hydrogen bomb programme, gradually superseding Penney. The scientists and politicians considered abandoning Green Granite. The Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, queried Cook on the imperative to persist with thermonuclear designs, given that Orange Herald satisfied most military requirements, and the tests were very expensive. Cook replied that megaton-range fission bombs represented an uneconomical use of expensive fissile material; that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> built to produce yields {{of more than a}} megaton; and that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> made small enough to be carried by aircraft smaller than the V-bombers, or on missiles. Sandys was not convinced, but he authorised further tests, as did the Prime Minister, now Harold Macmillan following Eden's resignation {{in the wake of the}} Suez crisis. The earliest possible date was November 1957 unless the Operation Antler tests were cancelled; but the Foreign Office warned that a moratorium on nuclear testing might come into effect in late October.|$|E
5|$|After 13,000 {{years the}} Grand Galactics finally return to Earth and are astounded {{to see how}} fast the planet has developed.

5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to ensure their readiness {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings could not be dismounted which meant that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> railed to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War, the US Army {{considered}} new {{options for}} the integration and organization of active duty, Army Reserve and Army National Guard units in training and deployment. Two division headquarters activated in the active duty component for training National Guard units. The 7th Infantry Division and the 24th Infantry Division headquarters were selected. The subordinate brigades of the divisions did not activate so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> deployed as divisions, however their active duty status would allow the headquarters to focus on the national guard units under them full-time.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the tournament, each {{participating}} nation had to submit a list of players for its roster. A minimum of 15 skaters and two goaltenders and a maximum of 20 skaters and three goaltenders had to be selected. After {{the start of}} the tournament, each team was allowed to add additional players to their roster, for a maximum of 25. Once players were registered to the team, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> removed from the roster.|$|E
5|$|In a {{revision}} of basal Dinosauria, Padian and May (1993) discussed {{the definition of the}} clade, and redefined it as the latest common ancestor of Triceratops and birds. They also discussed what this definition would do to the most basal taxa, such as Herrerasauridae, and Eoraptor. Padian and May considered that since both Herrerasauridae and Eoraptor lack many diagnostic features of Saurischia or Ornithischia, that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> considered inside Dinosauria.|$|E

5|$|O'Regan {{said that}} Australian players were not {{prepared}} for playing cricket in Asia, as they {{were not aware of}} the dangers of bookmakers and betting on the Indian subcontinent.

5|$|One of Morgan's stated {{interests}} was to lead {{a program}} of research into household practices; {{she did not want}} to teach traditional home economics principles if <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> supported by science. This meant that her students were required to possess a science background that was more stringent than other U.S. home economics programs. Consequently, her graduates found themselves prepared for roles that had not usually been open to traditional home economics graduates, such as hospital nutrition management and teaching in the basic sciences.|$|E

5|$|Prices {{remained}} high in Dawson {{and supply}} fluctuated {{according to the}} season. During the winter of 1897 salt became worth its weight in gold, while nails, vital for construction work, rose in price to $28 ($760) per lb (0.45kg). Cans of butter sold for $5 ($140) each. The only eight horses in Dawson were slaughtered for dog food as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> kept alive over the winter. The first fresh goods arriving {{in the spring of}} 1898 sold for record prices, eggs reaching $3 ($81) each and apples $1 ($27).|$|E
5|$|The Sugar Act {{provoked}} outrage in Boston, {{where it}} was widely viewed {{as a violation of}} colonial rights. Men such as James Otis and Samuel Adams argued that because the colonists were not represented in Parliament, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> taxed by that body; only the colonial assemblies, where the colonists were represented, could levy taxes upon the colonies. Hancock was not yet a political activist; however, he criticized the tax for economic, rather than constitutional, reasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebuilding}} solved most of {{the maintenance}} problems whilst retaining the excellent features of the original design. Repair costs were reduced by up to 60%, and coal consumption was reduced by up to 8.4%. However the Walschaerts valve gear made the rebuilds heavier and prone to hammerblow on the track, a complaint that was not evident with the original design. The increased weight reduced their route availability, meaning that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> used on certain routes available to un-rebuilt examples, such as the line to Ilfracombe.|$|E

5|$|When {{vineyards}} in the south-west Cape started letting weeds grow between vines {{to conserve}} moisture, around 1956, the Cape sparrow moved in.

However, vineyards are not optimal habitat: some populations have had such a low reproductive success that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> maintained without immigration.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Nankiwi in the plane, a {{small group}} of Huaorani decided to make the trip to Palm Beach, and left the {{following}} morning, January 7. On the way, they encountered Nankiwi and the girl, returning unescorted. The girl's brother, Nampa, was furious at this, and to defuse the situation and divert attention from himself, Nankiwi claimed that the foreigners had attacked them on the beach, and in their haste to flee, they had been separated from their chaperone. Gikita, {{a senior member of the}} group whose experience with outsiders had taught him that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> trusted, recommended that they kill the foreigners. The return of the older woman and her account of the friendliness of the missionaries was not enough to dissuade them, and they soon continued toward the beach.|$|E
