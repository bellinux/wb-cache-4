5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} {{is an active}} predator <b>that</b> <b>captures</b> prey by wrapping its pectoral fins around it, before manipulating it to the mouth. It is the only stingray in which both sexes have pointed teeth, for grasping and cutting into slippery prey. A wide variety of organisms are represented in its diet: crustaceans including amphipods, krill, and larval crabs, molluscs including squid, octopus, and pteropods, bony fishes including herring, mackerel, sea horses and filefish, comb jellies and medusae, and polychaete worms. Off California, {{pelagic stingray}}s hunt large mating aggregations of squid that form from November to April. Off Brazil, this species follows groups of Atlantic cutlassfish (Trichiurus lepturus) towards the coast in January and February, with both predators seeking small schooling fishes. Juvenile rays consume 67% of their body weight in food per day, which declines to just above 1% in adults.|$|E

The only exception is (potentially) royal pieces (emperors, kings, princes, and drunk elephants) which promote to their normal promoted forms, or stay as they are if already promoted.|$|E

25|$|A Kaldor–Hicks improvement, {{named for}} Nicholas Kaldor and John Hicks, {{also known as}} the Kaldor–Hicks criterion, is a way of judging {{economic}} re-allocations of resources among people <b>that</b> <b>captures</b> some of the intuitive appeal of Pareto efficiencies, but has less stringent criteria and is hence applicable to more circumstances. A re-allocation is a Kaldor–Hicks improvement if those that are made better off could hypothetically compensate those that are made worse off and lead to a Pareto-improving outcome. The compensation does not actually have to occur (there is no presumption in favor of status-quo) and thus, a Kaldor–Hicks improvement can in fact leave some people worse off.|$|E
25|$|Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS): The VIMS is {{a remote}} sensing {{instrument}} <b>that</b> <b>captures</b> images using visible and infrared light {{to learn more}} about the composition of moon surfaces, the rings, and the atmospheres of Saturn and Titan. It is made up of two cameras in one: one used to measure visible light, the other infrared. VIMS measures reflected and emitted radiation from atmospheres, rings and surfaces over wavelengths from 350 to 5100nm, to help determine their compositions, temperatures and structures. It also observes the sunlight and starlight that passes through the rings {{to learn more about}} their structure. Scientists used VIMS for long-term studies of cloud movement and morphology in the Saturn system, to determine Saturn's weather patterns.|$|E
25|$|Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS): The ISS is {{a remote}} sensing {{instrument}} <b>that</b> <b>captures</b> most images in visible light, {{and also some}} infrared images and ultraviolet images. The ISS has taken {{hundreds of thousands of}} images of Saturn, its rings, and its moons. The ISS has a wide-angle camera (WAC) that takes pictures of large areas, and a narrow-angle camera (NAC) that takes pictures of small areas in fine detail. Each of these cameras uses a sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) as its electromagnetic wave detector. Each CCD has a 1,024 square array of pixels, 12μm on a side. Both cameras allow for many data collection modes, including on-chip data compression. Both cameras are fitted with spectral filters that rotate on a wheel—to view different bands within the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from 0.2 to 1.1μm.|$|E

25|$|Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS): The UVIS is a remote-sensing {{instrument}} <b>that</b> <b>captures</b> {{images of}} the ultraviolet light reflected off an object, such as the clouds of Saturn and/or its rings, {{to learn more about}} their structure and composition. Designed to measure ultraviolet light over wavelengths from 55.8 to 190nm, this instrument is also a tool to help determine the composition, distribution, aerosol particle content and temperatures of their atmospheres. Unlike other types of spectrometer, this sensitive instrument can take both spectral and spatial readings. It is particularly adept at determining the composition of gases. Spatial observations take a wide-by-narrow view, only one pixel tall and 64 pixels across. The spectral dimension is 1,024 pixels per spatial pixel. Also, it can take many images that create movies {{of the ways in which}} this material is moved around by other forces.|$|E
25|$|One {{consequence}} of these positions that Unger points {{to is the}} revision of the concept and function of mathematics. If {{there is only one}} world drenched in time through and through, then mathematics cannot be a timeless expression of multiple universes <b>that</b> <b>captures</b> reality. Rather, Unger argues that mathematics is a means of analyzing the world removed of time and phenomenal distinction. By emptying the world of time and space it is able to better focus on one aspect of reality: the recurrence of certain ways in which pieces of the world relate to other pieces. Its subject matter are the structured wholes and bundles of relations, which we see outside mathematics only as embodied in the time-bound particulars of the manifest world. In this way, mathematics extends our problem solving powers as an extension of human insight, {{but it is not a}} part of the world.|$|E
25|$|The Science and Engineering {{building}} {{received a}} LEED Silver rating in March 2009. SEB achieved this rating by using recycled glass, steel, concrete, and wood. More than 60% of the leftover construction materials were recycled. The roof of SEB {{was made to}} reflect 92 percent of sunlight. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed into the building and therefore, reduces energy needed to cool the building. Incoming air to SEB is also pre-cooled through evaporation so the need for air conditioning is reduced. High performance window glazing also allows light to come in while keeping the building insulated. Occupancy sensors allow lights to automatically turn off when a room is not occupied, saving electricity. Low-flow sinks, toilets, and showers, {{as well as a}} drip irrigation system for the native desert landscape reduces water usage by 42%. SEB also uses a reclaimed water system <b>that</b> <b>captures</b> wastewater, providing 750 gallons of water a day that is used to flush toilets.|$|E
