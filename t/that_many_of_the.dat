5|$|Han {{scholars}} such as Jia Yi (201–169 BC) {{portrayed the}} previous Qin dynasty as a brutal regime.

5|$|After Climbié's death, {{the parties}} {{involved}} in her case were widely criticised. A public inquiry, headed by Lord Laming, was ordered. It discovered numerous instances where Climbié could have been saved, noted <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organisations involved in her care were badly run, and discussed the racial aspects surrounding the case, {{as many of the}} participants were black. The subsequent report by Laming made numerous recommendations related to child protection in England. Climbié's death was largely responsible for the formation of the Every Child Matters initiative; the introduction of the Children Act 2004; the creation of the ContactPoint project, a government database designed to hold information on all children in England (now defunct after closure by the government of 2010); and the creation of the Office of the Children's Commissioner chaired by the Children's Commissioner for England.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press {{have often been}} favourable, there have been criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, {{considered}} {{that some of the}} illustrations are small and garish or technically inaccurate. He also believes that the over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and dismissal of the wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is a mistake, and states <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research.|$|E

Hank realizes he cannot use the money without being caught; he goes home and burns it all. In a closing narration, Hank reflects on his losses; as he tries to move on with his life, the murderous events constantly haunt him.|$|E
5|$|Birt, Hogg, and Dubé {{examined}} {{a family with}} a hereditary thyroid cancer and discovered <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> members had fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons, which became defined as the classical symptoms of the eponymous disease. The first case of spontaneous pneumothorax associated with BHD was discovered in 1986; the first case of renal cancer followed in 1993 {{and the presence of}} lung cysts in people with BHD was confirmed in 1999. It was formerly thought that people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome were at higher risk for colorectal polyps and neoplasms, but this has been disproven. The BHD Foundation supports research into the syndrome and holds regular symposia in BHD and related disorders for researchers, clinicians, and family members.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{their losses}} the French {{survivors}} {{returned to the}} remaining guns, although most of their first broadside scattered into the sea, and {{at least some of}} their shot was misdirected towards the merchant ships. The French gunners aimed too high however, most of their shot tearing through the rigging of Sybille while the British broadsides slammed into the hull of Forte. This problem was partly attributed to the French gun quoins which had been replaned three days earlier, exacerbated by the lack of suitable gun crews which meant <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upperdeck guns were unmanned. The French gunners were also more used to firing warning shots at distant merchant ships and may not have realised that their guns needed to be depressed for combat at point blank range.|$|E
5|$|During the AprilAugust 1832 Black Hawk War, {{between white}} {{settlers}} in the lead mining regions and Sauk Chief Black Hawk's British Band, Hamilton again served in the volunteer militia. Accounts of the war indicated that Hamilton was often {{in charge of the}} militia's indigenous allies. At the war's onset it was known <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sioux and Menominee were eager to join the conflict against the Sauk. Hamilton was sent to the Michigan Territory, north of Prairie du Chien, to recruit the assistance of indigenous allies. The result was successful and several parties of U.S. aligned Native Americans joined the war.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} in the Senate, he {{returned}} to Henderson and resumed his law practice. He was a delegate to the Union National Convention in 1866. In 1867, he was again nominated to the U.S. Senate, but after several ballots over several months, the General Assembly had not elected him. Powell believed <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legislators had been elected {{as a result of}} election interference by Northern forces, and that their intent was to prevent Kentucky from electing a senator at all, diminishing her influence nationally. In light of this belief, he urged the Democrats to withdraw his name and nominate someone more palatable to Union sympathizers. This they did, putting forth the name of Garrett Davis, who was subsequently elected.|$|E

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of her career, Connecticut sailed to various places in both the Atlantic and Pacific while training newer recruits to the Navy. However, {{the provisions of the}} 1922 Washington Naval Treaty stipulated <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older battleships, Connecticut among them, would have to be disposed of, so she was decommissioned on 1 March 1923 and sold for scrap on 1 November 1923.|$|E
5|$|Further {{controversy}} ensued at the Belgian Grand Prix at the Spa circuit. The circuit {{had been}} paved {{just days before}} the race, creating a track <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> racers felt was unsafe due to diesel fuel seeping to the surface. Roberts and the new championship points leader, Virginio Ferrari, instigated a riders' revolt and refused to race. Once again, the FIM responded by suspending Roberts and Ferrari. The FIM later reduced this to another probation. The event highlighted the animosity between Roberts and the FIM concerning track safety. Roberts further irritated the FIM when he began talking to the press about forming a rival racing series to compete against the FIM's monopoly.|$|E
5|$|However, the Russian Army's {{transformation}} into a professional army was not deemed as successful. In September 2008, General Vladimir Boldyrev acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> professional soldiers {{did not have}} better training than the conscripts. Russian Airborne Troops and special forces conducted {{most of the land}} fighting. Due to the Russian Air Force's inability to penetrate Georgian air defence, airborne troops could not be airlifted behind Georgian lines. An ambush of a ground-troop commander, in which only five of thirty vehicles in his convoy survived, indicated intelligence and surveillance negligence. Many Russian land units reportedly had an insufficient ammunition supply.|$|E
