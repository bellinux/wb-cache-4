5|$|At {{the time}} of the crash, Crossair was a {{majority}} owned subsidiary of SAirGroup. <b>The</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> Crossair Flight LX498 {{was the first time in}} Crossair's 25-year history that the regional airline had lost an aircraft, and was the deadliest accident to hit the SAirGroup since <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> Swissair Flight 111, an MD-11 flying from New York to Geneva that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Nova Scotia on 2 September 1998, killing all 229 aboard.|$|E

5|$|Nearly {{a century}} later, during <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> the Mississippi Company and the South Sea Company in about 1720, tulip mania {{appeared}} in satires of these manias. When Johann Beckmann first described tulip mania in the 1780s, he {{compared it to}} the failing lotteries of the time. In Goldgar's view, even many modern popular works about financial markets, such as Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street (1973) and John Kenneth Galbraith's A Short History of Financial Euphoria (1990; written soon after <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> 1987), used the tulip mania as a lesson in morality. Tulip mania again became a popular reference during the dot-com bubble of 1995–2001.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> Flight 1907 precipitated a major {{crisis in}} Brazil's civil {{aviation}} system, which included massive flight delays and cancellations, {{air traffic controller}} work-to-rule slowdowns and strikes, and public safety concerns about Brazil's airport and air traffic infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> National Airlines Flight 2511 came {{shortly after}} <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> another National Airlines plane. National Airlines Flight 967 {{exploded}} over the Gulf of Mexico on November 16, 1959. The {{cause of the}} explosion {{was believed to be}} a bomb in the luggage of one of the passengers, Dr. Robert Spears, who enlisted a substitute to board the plane in his place. Spears was heavily insured, and the FBI indicated that his motive was insurance fraud. Similarly, Julian Frank was covered by almost $900,000 in life insurance policies, including some purchased the day of the crash.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> another DC-10 {{at the end}} of November, Air New Zealand Flight 901, exactly {{six months}} after Flight 191, added to the DC-10's {{negative}} reputation. <b>The</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> Flight 901, an Antarctic sightseeing flight which hit a mountain, was caused by several human and environmental factors not related to the airworthiness of the DC-10, and the aircraft was later completely exonerated in that accident.|$|E

5|$|A set {{of events}} {{similar to those}} that doomed Star Dust also caused <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 in 1972 (depicted in the film Alive), though there were {{survivors}} from that crash because it involved a glancing blow to a mountainside rather than a head-on collision.|$|E

5|$|At that time, <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> Flight 663 was {{the fifth}} worst {{aviation}} accident to {{have occurred in the}} United States.

5|$|In 1991, Lauda Air Flight 004, {{operated}} by a Boeing 767, crashed after the left engine thrust reverser deployed in-flight for reasons {{that could not be}} determined. <b>The</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> a TAM Airlines Fokker 100 in 1996 was attributed to the deployment of the thrust reverser on No. 2 engine.

5|$|One of the depot's wartime {{commanding}} officers was Wing Commander John Lerew, {{who held}} the post from December 1942 until November 1943. During his tenure, after investigating <b>the</b> <b>crash</b> <b>of</b> a Vultee Vengeance, he designed a clip to prevent the accidental release of the pilot's safety harness, which was later adopted for all such harnesses. By January 1945, No.1 AD's strength had increased to its highest level of 2,339 staff.|$|E
5|$|Penshurst Airfield was an {{airfield}} {{in operation}} between 1916–36 and 1940–46.
