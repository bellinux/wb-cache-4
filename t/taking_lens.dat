50|$|The new Wide Rolleiflex uses a 50mm/f4 Schneider Super-Angulon <b>taking</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E
50|$|Launched in 1968, {{this was}} a twin section {{detachable}} monobloc consisting of a fixed infinity focus 2.8 50mm <b>taking</b> <b>lens</b> and a focusable anamorphic adapter that could be unscrewed from the <b>taking</b> <b>lens.</b> A standard 100mm projector lens {{was included in the}} Iscorama kit, and the anamorphic adapter could be attached to this, allowing the optically distorted images captured by the Iscorama monobloc to be projected in the correct aspect ratio.|$|E
5000|$|Rolleinar: A set of {{close-up}} lenses, {{in three}} magnifications (Rolleinar 1, Rolleinar 2, and Rolleinar 3). A pair of Rolleinar lenses {{are placed on}} both the viewing and <b>taking</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{original}} Iscoramas {{are still}} amongst {{the most sought-after}} of all Iscoramas due to their flexibility - the assembled monobloc is an excellent 50mm lens for full frame DSLRs, whilst the adapter {{can be used with}} a large number of <b>taking</b> <b>lenses</b> on APS-C and Micro Four Thirds cameras without excessive vignetting occurring.|$|R
50|$|The view finder lens {{was placed}} {{directly}} {{between the two}} <b>taking</b> <b>lenses</b> and placed at the same vertical level. This was made possiblethrough the use of mirrors. This made framing shots easy. A spirit level was visible in the view finder, {{making it easier to}} avoid camera tilt, one of the pitfalls of stereo photography.|$|R
5000|$|The first Rolleiflex {{to offer}} a Schneider Kreuznach Xenar <b>taking</b> <b>lens</b> as an option, in {{addition}} to the Carl Zeiss Tessar.|$|E
50|$|The {{anamorphic}} {{section of}} the original Iscorama was the template for subsequent Iscorama adapters, all of which shared its 1.5× horizontal stretch ratio, patented focusing mechanism, and adjustable anamorphic alignment capability. The ISCO anamorphic focusing mechanism was unique in that the <b>taking</b> <b>lens</b> was simply set to infinity and then focus was adjusted using the anamorphic adapter alone. This was a major advance on competing manufacturers' designs, all of which required that focus was calibrated simultaneously on both the <b>taking</b> <b>lens</b> and the adapter.|$|E
50|$|Twin-lens reflex (TLR) cameras {{had a large}} lens {{above the}} <b>taking</b> <b>lens,</b> and a large mirror at 45°, {{projecting}} an image onto a ground glass screen viewable from above, with the camera at waist level. The viewfinder lens was of similar size and focal length to the <b>taking</b> <b>lens,</b> though the optical quality was less critical; the mirror was of similar size to the film. These cameras were relatively expensive; the Rolleiflex and cheaper sister Rolleicord were the pioneers. Both single- and twin-lens reflexes allowed focussing by adjusting the lens until the image was sharp.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Iscoramas were discontinued {{at the end}} of the 1970s, {{by which}} point in time ISCO had released the Cinegon C-Mount Cine lens, plus the Iscorama 36 and Iscorama 54 screw-in anamorphic adapters, and the associated Iscostat projection mount system. These new stand-alone adapters were a tacit acknowledgement of the fact that many ISCO customers were mounting the front element of the original Iscorama detachable monobloc onto other manufacturers' <b>taking</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The metal-bodied Iscorama 54 was {{the next}} {{anamorphic}} adapter to be released by ISCO, and was the largest of all Iscoramas. Although it was a totally different physical design to the original Iscorama and the Iscorama 36/Cinegon, the optical and mechanical configuration was very similar, with all three lenses sharing an identical focus and anamorphic alignment mechanism. Because of its large rear anamorphic element, and wide diameter mounting thread (77mm), the 54 can be attached to a much wider range of <b>taking</b> <b>lenses</b> than other Iscoramas without vignetting occurring (although a 35mm focal length {{seems to be the}} limit on APS-C cameras). One of the downsides of the Iscorama 54’s larger dimensions is the 95mm front filter thread, which has negative ramifications for the cost of filters and close-up lenses. Fortunately, it is possible to fix smaller (67mm and larger) filters within the recessed front opening of the lens without causing excessive vignetting.|$|R
30|$|The {{specimens}} {{were placed}} into a {{universal testing machine}} (UTM) (Instron 5566). Displacement was tracked on the two faces perpendicular to the axis of loading with two digital cameras fitted with 60 -mm macro <b>lenses</b> <b>taking</b> images every 3  s.|$|R
50|$|Extreme dark {{photographic}} filter like the opaque Wratten 87 {{can be used}} without problems, as they cover and thus darken only the <b>taking</b> <b>lens.</b> The image in the viewfinder stays bright.|$|E
50|$|This camera used a 135 mm/f4.0 Carl Zeiss Sonnar <b>taking</b> <b>lens.</b> The {{introduction}} to a 1990 sale catalogue by Sotheby's auction house in London estimated that approximately 1200 cameras existed at that date.|$|E
50|$|Incorporated {{the first}} 8 cm f2.8 <b>taking</b> <b>lens</b> (either an 80 mm Carl Zeiss Tessar or Opton Tessar) into the Rolleiflex line. It also added an X flash synch contact. Built from 1949 to 1951.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} digital cameras {{approximate}} {{the look of}} the 16 mm format by using 16 mm-sized sensors and <b>taking</b> 16 mm <b>lenses.</b> These cameras include the Ikonoskop A-Cam DII (2008) and the Digital Bolex (2012). The Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera (2013) has a Super 16-sized sensor.|$|R
50|$|Afocal photography, {{also called}} afocal imaging or afocal {{projection}} {{is a method}} of photography where the camera with its lens attached is mounted over the eyepiece of another image forming system such as an optical telescope or optical microscope, with the camera <b>lens</b> <b>taking</b> {{the place of the}} human eye.|$|R
50|$|Manual lens {{controllers}} {{are composed}} of switches and a power supply. When the operator actuates a switch, {{a function of the}} lens is enabled. Manual control requires an operator to view the image through the lens in which adjustment is <b>taking</b> place. Manual <b>lens</b> controllers are the most common and are frequently used in CCTV security systems.|$|R
50|$|The <b>taking</b> <b>lens</b> is a six-element coated Helgor 25 mm F2 lens, {{focusing}} from {{12 inches}} to infinity. A {{depth of field}} table {{is built into the}} camera panel. Aperture 2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{photographic}} {{filters are}} inconvenient without {{line of sight}} through the <b>taking</b> <b>lens</b> - notably, graduated neutral density filters are hard to use with a TLR, {{as there is no}} easy way to position the filter accurately.|$|E
50|$|This camera had a 55 mm/f4.0 Carl Zeiss Distagon <b>taking</b> <b>lens.</b> The {{introduction}} to a 1990 sale catalogue by Sotheby's auction house in London estimated {{that fewer than}} 700 such cameras existed at that date. Only 3600 models were originally produced.|$|E
50|$|While the Robots {{were capable}} of {{sequence}} photography, the shutter that made this possible placed some constraints upon <b>taking</b> <b>lenses</b> and shutter speeds. To reach speeds as high as 1/500 second the inertia of the thin vulcanite shutter disc had to be kept at a minimum, requiring a small-diameter disc with a minimal sector opening. The screw in lens mount was 26 mm in diameter. The clear lens opening was only 20 mm. In contrast, Leica's mount was almost twice as large at 39 mm. Further, to permit lens interchangeability, the shutter was mounted behind the lens so the disc interrupted the expanding light cone. This placed some limits on lens design. While the 75mm Sonnar could be used with the aperture set to f/22, the Tele-Xenar suffered from some shutter disc vignetting unless opened more.The maximum focal length lens for general photographic use that could be fitted with acceptable vignetting was 75 mm, although telephotos up to 600 mm were offered. A 150 mm Tele-Xenar was available for long-distance action photography, but it produced a vignetted circular image on the 24 × 24 mm frame. The lack of a rangefinder on the Robot and Robot Star required zone focusing of these long lenses: every shot had to be estimated or premeasured. All of the mechanical movement made for a noisy camera, although not as noisy as some modern motor drives. For an extra fee, Robot-Berning supplied silenced versions with nylon gears.|$|R

2500|$|Some {{scenes in}} the film have a blurred effect around {{the borders of the}} frame. These were {{achieved}} by <b>taking</b> old wide-angle <b>lenses</b> and mounting them onto the front of several cameras (Arri Macros in this case). Deakins claimed to have pioneered this technique, naming these combinations of lenses [...] "Deakinizers", which created the effect of vignetting and a slight color aberration around the edges. Deakins recalls: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{viewfinder}} of any {{camera that}} does not allow viewing through the <b>taking</b> <b>lens,</b> including rangefinder cameras, is necessarily offset from the <b>taking</b> <b>lens,</b> so that the image shown is not exactly what will be recorded on the film; this parallax error is negligible at large subject distances, but increases as the distance decreases. More advanced rangefinder cameras project into the viewfinder a brightline frame that moves as the lens is focused, correcting parallax error down to the minimum distance at which the rangefinder functions. The angle {{of view of a}} given lens also changes with distance, and the brightline frames in the finders of a few cameras automatically adjust for this as well. For extreme close-up photography, the rangefinder camera is awkward to use, as the viewfinder no longer points at the subject.|$|E
5000|$|Rolleisoft: A {{soft focus}} lens for the <b>taking</b> <b>lens</b> only {{available}} in two grades, [...] "0" [...] and [...] "1", which softens the definition and produce striking halo effects, particularly when used with back lighting. The Rolleisoft lens has concentric circles ground in groves and is used principally for portraiture.|$|E
5000|$|Later models {{incorporated}} improved {{designs for}} the <b>taking</b> <b>lens,</b> a 4-element Schneider Kreuznach Xenar, which also appeared on the Rolleiflex cameras. However, while the Rolleiflex was available with an f/2.8 lens, the Rolleicord was never offered with a larger aperture than f/3.5, thus ensuring its pedigree as an [...] "amateur" [...] camera.|$|E
5000|$|In 1974 he {{completed}} {{a series of}} [...] "Soho District" [...] works such as [...] "Soho West Broadway" [...] by using telephoto <b>lenses</b> <b>taking</b> pictures of New York Soho building facades, then in 1975 he painted bird's-eye view street scenes of New York City. In 1977 {{he completed}} [...] "Lunch Time", featuring people as a subject for the first time, using acrylic spray on canvas.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the question of}} women trafficking arguing that <b>taking</b> gender <b>lenses</b> and offering human security framework will provide an important angle for examining the problem. It takes Ukraine {{as a case study}} and suggests that inbuilt in the Ukrainian society gender inequalities which reproduce gender identities is a major factor contributing to women’s insecurity {{on the one hand and}} making them vulnerable to trafficking on the other hand. It describes that traditional understanding of security in the field of international relations dominated by the realist discourse does not address the problem of trafficking. Women’s experiences are not included and trafficking generally is considered to fall within private sphere within public / private dichotomy. Human security framework may be a solution to locate the problem and make women’s experiences visible...|$|R
50|$|The {{next major}} step {{took place in}} 1938, with the {{introduction}} of the Focusing Brillant. A small opaque spot is added in the brilliant finder to focus on. The viewing and <b>taking</b> <b>lens</b> are coupled outside the body through gears. After the introduction of this focusing model, the zone-focusing models continued to be produced.|$|E
50|$|The camera has a {{built-in}} lightmeter using a CdS photocell mounted on the photographer's left-hand side; unlike later cameras, it does not meter through the <b>taking</b> <b>lens.</b> A lever switched between low sensitivity for bright subjects (EV 9-18) and high sensitivity for dark subjects (EV 1-10) (at ISO 100). Film speeds supported are ISO 10 through 800.|$|E
50|$|The {{first was}} the {{inclusion}} of a small grub screw which could be adjusted to allow closer focusing. Unfortunately, the resultant image quality is very soft, and there are also extremely high levels of edge fringing, making the hack unsuitable for conventional video and still image capture. The second of the Iscorama 42ʼs unique features was its ratcheting anamorphic alignment mechanism, which was actuated by sliding the rubber grip section {{at the rear of the}} lens forward by two millimetres. This proved to be inferior to the lockable, free rotating mechanism on other Iscoramas; the ratchet indent spacing being too coarse to allow absolutely precise alignment of the anamorphic when screwed onto a <b>taking</b> <b>lens.</b> The most obvious side effect of this issue is the notable difficulty in achieving perfectly horizontal anamorphic lens flares with the Iscorama 42 when the adapter is attached directly to a <b>taking</b> <b>lens.</b>|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{appraise}} {{history and}} symptom <b>taking</b> for contact <b>lens</b> consultations, to determine current practice {{and to make}} recommendations for best practice. Method: The peer reviewed academic literature was reviewed and the results informed a survey completed by 256 eye care practitioners (ECPs) on their current practice and influences. Results: The last eye-test date, last contact lens aftercare (for existing wearers) and reason for visit are key questions for most ECPs. Detailed use of contact lens questions are more commonly applied in aftercares than when refitting patients who have previously discontinued wear (87 % vs 56 % use), whereas questions on ocular and general history, medication and lifestyle were generally more commonly utilised for new patients than in aftercares (72 % vs 50 %). 75 % of ECPs requested patients bring a list of their medication to appointments. Differential diagnosis questioning was thorough in most ECPs (87 % of relevant questions asked). Attempts to optimise compliance included oral instruction (95 % always) and written patient instructions (95 % at least sometimes). Abbreviations were used by 39 % of respondents (26 % used ones provided by a professional body). Conclusion: There is scope for more consistency in history and symptom <b>taking</b> for contact <b>lens</b> consultations and recommendations are made...|$|R
