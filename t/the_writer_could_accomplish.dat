40|$|One of the {{problems}} in the automatic recognition of cursive and mixed-cursive handwriting is the large variation of handwriting styles in a population.

5|$|The {{character}} {{is named after}} Richard Appel's wife, who is the novelist Mona Simpson. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> acknowledge that several people fit her description. Her crime was intentionally the least violent crime <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>could</b> think of, as she did not harm anyone and was only caught because {{she came back to}} help Mr. Burns.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the pilot}} episode {{featured}} an extra male liaison named Scott Woodville (David Ogden Stiers), he was dropped {{for the series}} as it was felt {{there was no need}} for Charlie to have two male liaisons. It was also felt that the character of Woodville was rather too severe, whereas Bosley was someone <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>could</b> use to add humor to the episodes.|$|R
5000|$|Holmes {{believes}} that the cryptic note came from this household, High Gable, and <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>could</b> only be Miss Burnet, {{who has not been}} seen since the night of the murder.

Freddy J. da Costa was the President, Mr. Tomazinho Cardozo was the secretary and Mr. Prabhakar Tendulkar the treasurer. During this period, DKA published 'Konkani Orthography in Roman Script' {{with the intention of}} bringing about a desirable unity among <b>the</b> <b>writers,</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>could</b> understand <b>the</b> principles and rules of writing Konkani in Roman script.|$|R
500|$|The {{first episode}} {{to delve into}} Bobby's backstory was the third season's [...] "Dream a Little Dream of Me". Because <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> always knew his history would be [...] "grounded in family", the episode's teaser {{initially}} depicted the supernatural deaths of his children. However, <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>could</b> not determine where to go from there. Following writer Cathryn Humphris' earlier pitch of Bobby being an expert exorcist because of a previous failed exorcism, the focus changed to Bobby's torment about killing his demonically-possessed wife.|$|R

The title sequence of this episode featured a tombstone reading [...] "Amusing Tombstones", which was a sign that <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>could</b> no longer devise ideas to use as humorous tombstone messages. Similar sequences were featured as introductions in all four preceding Treehouse of Horror episodes, but have not been featured since this episode.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-3rd {{millennium}} BC, writing direction {{was changed}} to left-to-right in horizontal rows (rotating all of the pictographs 90° counter-clockwise in the process), and a new wedge-tipped stylus was used which was pushed into the clay, producing wedge-shaped ("cuneiform") signs; these two developments made writing quicker and easier. By adjusting the relative position of the tablet to <b>the</b> stylus, <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>could</b> use a single tool to make a variety of impressions.|$|R

5|$|The episode {{features}} the first {{appearance of the}} bowling alley Barney's Bowlarama. The original backstory for Barney's Bowlarama {{was that it was}} owned by Barney Gumble. Over time it changed to Barney just being an employee, as <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>could</b> not imagine Barney owning anything. It was later revealed that Barney's uncle was the owner. The exterior of the Bowlarama was designed by No Doubt member Eric Stefani. The episode also marks the first appearances of Lenny Leonard and Helen Lovejoy.|$|R
5000|$|The {{outcome of}} PG medial *ts in Homeric Greek is s {{after a long}} vowel, and vacillation between s and ss after a short vowel: tátēsi dat. pl. [...] "rug" [...] < tátēt-, possí(n)/posí(n) dat. pl. [...] "foot" [...] < pod-. This was useful for the {{composer}} of the Iliad and Odyssey, since possí with double ss scans as long-short, while posí with single s scans as short-short. Thus <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>could</b> use each form in different positions in a line.|$|R
40|$|Many {{investigators}} have sought evidence on {{how and where}} DDT (l, l, l-parachlorodiphenyl trichlorethane) penetrates the insect body and where it effects its lethal action. Disagreement in the results and interpretation of results still leaves much doubt as to where penetration is most easily effected and <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>could</b> find no good evidence in the literature pointing at all conclusively to any site of DDT action. Definite information on these points should be of value in formulating DDT insecticides and designing methods for their use...|$|R

Analyzing the sources in which <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>could</b> have been inspired we can discover the mixture between the historical-legendary and biblical ingredients as the foundation stone of Rojas Zorrilla´s tragedy. Instead of using the canonical text of Genesis –commonly used by the chroniclers who {{tell the story of}} Berenguer and Ramón–, Rojas Zorrilla prefers to appeal an apocryphal version of the myth of Cain (like other contemporary playwrights) ...|$|R

[...] "If anyone ever doubted whether <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>could</b> believably pull off this meandering, long-winded story of how a father met his kids' future mother without dropping the pieces, this episode shows that the How I Met team has a strong grasp of how everything fits together." ...|$|R
5000|$|Zapp Brannigan: Leela has pity {{sex with}} the pompous, idiotic captain Zapp Brannigan in the episode where he is first introduced, [...] "Love's Labours Lost in Space"; {{according}} to Groening, the episode marked {{a turning point in}} the series, as it showed that <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>could</b> degrade <b>the</b> main heroine without alienating viewers from the show. Throughout the series, Brannigan constantly tries to entice her into dates and romantic encounters, much to her disgust, Leela denouncing him as an incompetent lover and general idiot.|$|R

[...] Titus also {{admitted}} that, even with the driest line <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>could</b> invent, Keach {{would find a way}} to make the line funny. [...] This often upset Titus because Keach's set-up would be funnier than Titus's punchline. Hargrove has also commented that Keach could get an audience response with just a look; Hargrove's favorite moment is the look Ken gives Tommy in [...] "Insanity Genetic (1)" [...] after Tommy comments [...] "I have no nuts." ...|$|R
5|$|Unlike Snow White, {{which was}} a short story that <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>could</b> expand and {{experiment}} with, Pinocchio {{was based on a}} novel with a very fixed story. Therefore, the story went through drastic changes before reaching its final incarnation. In the original novel, Pinocchio is a cold, rude, ungrateful, inhuman creature that often repels sympathy and only learns his lessons by means of brutal torture. <b>The</b> <b>writers</b> decided to modernize the character and depict him similar to Edgar Bergen's dummy Charlie McCarthy, but equally as rambunctious as the puppet in the book. The story was still being developed {{in the early stages of}} animation.|$|R

[...] However, <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>could</b> not determine where to go from there. Following Humphris' earlier pitch of Bobby being an expert exorcist because of a previous failed exorcism, the focus changed to Bobby's torment about killing his demonically possessed wife.|$|R
5000|$|Song number 8 {{was written}} by Julie Forsyth, the {{daughter}} of Bruce Forsyth, and performed by Scott Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald had a hit in the 1970s with [...] "If I Had Words" [...] and was fairly {{well known in the}} Netherlands. [...] The song was called [...] "Go", and was a ballad about being cheated on. Backing singers (including <b>the</b> <b>writer)</b> <b>could</b> be heard but not seen {{at the very end of}} the song. Bruce Welch felt that this was the kind of song that has won Eurovision in the past, and that it was a nice understated performance.|$|R
60|$|Miss Panney's {{letter to}} Dora Bannister {{contained}} some mild reproaches for the latter's departure from Thorbury without notice to her oldest friend, but her scolding was not severe, {{and there was}} as much pleasant information and inquiry as <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> <b>could</b> think of. Moreover, the epistle contained the suggestion that Dora should invite Miriam Haverley {{to come down and}} spend some time with her while she was at the seashore. This suggestion none but a very old friend would be likely to make, but Miss Panney was old enough for anything, in friendship or in any other way.|$|R
