25|$|Handicap {{systems have}} {{potential}} for abuse by players who may intentionally play badly {{to increase their}} handicap ("throwing their 'cap") before playing to their potential at an important event with a valuable prize. For this reason, professional golf associations do not use them, {{but they can be}} calculated and used along with other criteria to determine the relative strengths of various professional players. Touring professionals, being <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best,</b> often have negative handicaps; they can be expected, on average, to score lower than the Course Rating on any course.|$|E

25|$|For instance, {{medicine}} is traditionally {{one of the}} most popular courses in Portugal, and therefore {{one of the most}} selective, with some of the highest rated secondary school top students competing with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> for a place in a medicine course. Normally, a student who wants to attend the Medical School (Faculdade de Medicina) at one of the Portuguese public universities which exclusively offer this graduation course, has to get very high grades in the entrance exams (it may include exams in fields like chemistry, biology, and mathematics) and to have done an almost-brilliant secondary school course. Admission marks of the applicants admitted in medicine, are never less than 180 out of 200. Architecture, economics, a number of engineerings, dentistry, law, pharmacy, or veterinary medicine at most public universities, are, in general, another examples of courses which are traditionally the most selective or popular. In contrast with these, like in any other educational system in the world, there are many courses offered by private universities, polytechnic institutes, and public universities, where the entrance requirements are sharply below the average. There are also some courses with low or even no demand and condemned to be extinguished.|$|E

[...] They said they review bad games along with good games as they can't know what quality the game will be until they've actually played it, and also if all the reviewed games were given highly positive reviews, they reviews would be redundant and their rating system meaningless. Also, as games are expensive, the team want to warn viewers about what games they should avoid. They have also stated they make an effort to review games on all consoles.|$|E
2500|$|Pittacus said, [...] "The {{measure of}} a human is what he/she does with power." [...] As an {{organization}} is developed, power has to be expressed {{to be able to}} hold the structure of the organization together and has the ability to influence others. As influence takes over, tasks will be accomplished in the organization. The types of power that are expressed will determine the type of leadership styles, traits, function, and relations used. Since there has been the description of democratic leadership throughout, {{there are two types of}} power that would fit with democratic leadership: reward and referent. Reward power gives followers something to work for and accomplish in the organization. To get followers to work for the reward it needs to have some attractive desires. The desire will create motivation in the followers to work harder to obtain the reward. Using the reward will create discussion in the organization and the positive feedback will have followers work harder. This allows for efficiency and time management to be used because the followers want to be <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best.</b> The second type of power that could be used is referent power. This is having someone followers look up to that has the ability to influence their behavior. The use of referent power has a high follower task satisfaction and task performance [...] Using referent power shows trust is built with the leader because the leader is relational with the followers. Once leaders build trust followers will help in any way. This power can be related to relational leadership because of the idea of relationships being built in the organization. As a close relationship is built with followers, more information is exchanged in a two-way flow and it creates an established organization.|$|E
